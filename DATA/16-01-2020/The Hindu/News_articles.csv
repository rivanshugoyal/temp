Harshada’s showing, which was better than the National record of 132kg and is yet to be ratified, helped her top the combined list of under-17 and under-21 lifters. It also contributed in Maharashtra’s dominating performance of five medals, including three gold medals, in the weightlifting arena.

The Pune girl lifted 62kg in her final snatch attempt to lead the table. She failed in her first effort of 74kg in clean and jerk, but recovered to end up with 77kg and surge ahead.

Under-17 lifter Gyneshwari Yadav of Chhattisgarh (snatch 61kg, clean and jerk 76kg, total 137kg) and Haryana’s Komal Kohar, who topped the under-21 category, (59kg, 75kg, 134kg) stayed behind Harshada in the overall list. Techi Nadam (58kg, 75kg, 133kg) of Arunachal Pradesh and Sufina Jasmin (57kg, 73kg, 130kg) placed second and third respectively in under-21 category.

Among other Maharashtra lifters, Soumya Dalvi (50kg, 66kg,116kg) and Aarati Tatguni (50kg, 65kg, 115kg) claimed under-17 girls’ 40kg gold and silver respectively.

Mukund Aher claimed the first two places in boys’ under-17 49kg class.

Cycling: Karnataka’s Danamma Chichakha, Sahana Kudiganur, Keerthi Ramaswamy and Meghna Gugad won the girls’ under-21 team pursuit (4000m) gold with a timing of 5:38.298.

Andaman and Nicobar’s Celestina (12.928) and David Beckhame (10.891) took girls’ and boys’ sprint (200m) titles respectively to complete their respective individual double crowns.

Shooting: Haryana’s 13-year-old Shiva Narwal (243.2 points) pocketed the boys’ under-17 10m air pistol gold. His state-mate Naveen Singh (246.1) was the under-21 champion.

Wrestling: Pankaj (Uttar Pradesh), Pradeep (Haryana) Saddam (Maharashtra) won gold medals in boys’ under-21 Greco Roman 51kg, 55kg and 60kg respectively.

Maharashtra was firmly on top of the medals table with 125 medals, including 33 gold.

On Wednesday:

Volleyball: Kerala beat West Bengal 26-24, 25-16, 25-21 in the final and take the girls’ under-21 gold medal.

1,2020/01/16,Weightlifting | Soumya eyes Asian youth championships gold,"For 14-year-old Soumya Dalvi, life has tasted so many flavours before settling for his father Sunil’s passion – weightlifting. The teenager learnt music and dance and did athletics before finding her calling in lifting weights.

The tiny Thane lifter, who began weightlifting about two years ago, quickly found her feet in the sport and started winning medals. She caught everyone’s attention by claiming the Khelo India youth gold medal in girls' 40kg in Pune last year with a total of 113kg.

On Thursday, she defended her title in style by improving three kg and creating new (yet-to-be ratified) mark.

Interestingly, like previous year, Soumya got a stiff competition from her state mate Aarati Tatgunti, who again got the silver medal with 115kg.

The lead-up to the competition was tougher this year for Soumya. “Last year I reduced two kg, but this year I had to cut down four kg. It was very difficult. I was overweight by 700gm close to the weighing in. I was so desperate that I did not eat and drink for nearly two days, did sauna bath and tried crying to reduce weight,” Soumya, smiling ear-to-ear displaying her wired-up teeth, told The Hindu.

“I did singing, dancing and athletics before my father, who was a National-level gold medal winning lifter and a Chhatrapati award winner, asked me to do some exercise at our home gym. Slowly, he got involved and I started training,” said Soumya, who took gold medals in Khelo India, National youth championships and Commonwealth youth championships in the last one year.

Now, Soumya, a Class IX student, wants to continue her gold-medal winning streak and shine at the Asian youth championships in Uzbekistan next month.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/qekmuw/article30578777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17SOUMYA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/weightlifting-soumya-eyes-asian-youth-championships-gold/article30578778.ece
2,2020/01/16,Delhi International Open Grandmasters | Abhijeet retakes title in style,"Raising the bar when he needed to, Abhijeet Gupta pulled off a clinical win over Aleksej Aleksandrov to regain the title in the Delhi International Open Grandmasters chess tournament here on Thursday.

Winner in 2008 and 2014, Abhijeet tallied 8.5 points from 10 rounds to end the drought of an Indian champion since his last triumph in the richest prize-money event in the country. He ensured ₹6.50 lakh and a big-made trophy for his efforts.

Abhijeet scripted a dream comeback by scoring 6.5 points from the last seven rounds, following his third-round loss to Karthik Venkataraman. Interestingly, Aleksandrov who won the title in 2013 led at the start of every round but eventually finished second. Abhijeet never led until his fourth successive victory decided the title.

“I’ve been in this situation at least 15 times in my career where I needed to win the last round for the title,’ said Abhijeet and continued, “and this turned out to be my cleanest of the eight wins in the competition.

More challenging

“But honestly, I feel my ninth-round win over Diptayan Ghosh with black pieces was far more challenging, considering the fact that he hardly loses with white pieces,” said the 30-year-old champion.

The day also saw 13-year-old Tamil Nadu-lad M. Pranesh finish fifth with a resounding performance. This exceptional talent from Karaikudi scored eight points by remaining unbeaten and made a 10-game Grandmaster norm.

A trainee of noted coach R.B. Ramesh, Pranesh faced seven GMs and one International Master and scored six points off them. Rated 2317, the youngster gained a whopping 88 rating points by performing at 2645-level.

Important 10th round results (Indians unless stated): Abhijeet Gupta (8.5) bt Aleksej Aleksandrov (Blr, 8); P. Shyam Nikhil (7) lost to Pavel Ponkratov (Rus, 8); Kirill Stupak (Blr, 7) lost to Levan Pantsulaia (Geo, 8); Nodirbek Yakubboev (Uzb, 7.5) drew with Alexie Fedorov (Blr, 7.5); N.R.

Lalith Babu (7.5) bt Nguyen van Huy (6.5); K. Ratnakaran (7.5) bt Diptayan Ghosh (6.5).

Final standing (top-15): 1. Abhijeet (8.5 points), 2-5. Aleksandrov, Ponkratov, Pantsulaia, Pranesh (8 points each); 6-15. Yakubboev, Mchedlishvili, Fedorov, C.R.G. Krishna, Debashis Das, M.

3,2020/01/16,"Dipa has motivated young athletes immensely, says Shannon Miller","In her long and illustrious career, Shannon Miller has won seven Olympic medals. On personal front, the 42-year-old gymnast has survived ovarian cancer and has come back stronger to inspire many.

And on Thursday, Shannon —who is the brand ambassador of the 17th Tata Mumbai Marathon 2020 — admitted that Indian gymnast Dipa Karmakar has motivated young athletes immensely.

In the 2016 Olympics, Dipa won hearts after finishing fourth in the vault finals. “What Dipa has done is that she has really shown the other athletes in India and the world that they are on a stage and that opens up the younger generation athletes all over India to know that it is possible (to succeed) with hard work and passion,” Shannon said.

“(She showed) you can go to the height of your career even in Olympic Games. It’s a great way to inspire the youth of India.”

During the Rio Olympics, Dipa stunned the world with her Produnova — which is considered a death-defying vault. While many gymnasts prefer not trying out the high-risk stance, Shannon feels that it’s up to the individual to take a call.

“It depends on what skills you are taking about. It’s important in any sport to take as much precaution as she can to safe as possible. Safety has to come first,” she said.

With the Tokyo Games a few months away, Shannon is pinning her hopes on Simone Biles — who dominated the Rio Games four years ago.

“All eyes are on Simone at this moment. I am just excited to watch great gymnastics. Simone is 22, she has done an amazing job, she is so much fun to watch her. But you also have so many athletes out there, representing their countries,” she said.

Shannon’s tally of five medals — two silvers, three bronzes — at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics were the most won by a US athlete across sport at the Summer Games, and she feels that stricter routines have helped Biles come a long way.

“She has such an incredible difficulty in her routine. They start a higher level than everyone else. So not only does she start from a more difficulty in a higher score and she is able to perform with them at such consistent rates that it bodes well for her and a lot of medals (come her way),” she said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/dipa-has-motivated-young-athletes-immensely-says-shannon-miller/article30577963.ece
4,2020/01/16,Delhi International Open Grandmasters chess | Abhijeet plays Aleksandrov for title,"A third victory on the trot has earned Abhijeet Gupta a shot at a third title in Delhi International Open Grandmasters chess tournament.

In Thursday’s 10th and final round, Abhijeet (7.5 points) plays with white pieces against leader Aleksej Aleksandrov (8) of Belarus to decide the champion. Abhijeet needs a win while a draw is enough for Aleksandrov to take the title.

In the penultimate round, both won with black pieces in contrasting styles against Jose Eduardo Martinez Alcantara and Diptayan Ghosh.

In fact, on the top-20 boards, 13 games produced decisive verdicts, with most players keen to brighten their chances of finishing strongly in the richest prize-money International Open in the country.

Three Indians - M. Pranesh, Shyam Nikhil and N. R Visakh - were part of the eight-player bunch sharing the third spot with seven points. Of the lot, Pranesh collected a much deserved nine-game Grandmaster norm following a dream, unbeaten run. The Tamil Nadu lad, rated 2317, drew with seventh-seed Uzbek GM Nodirbek Yakubboev (2597).

In nine rounds, Pranesh faced six GMs and one Interational Mastrer and gained five points. His sterling performance has earned him 72.6 rating points so far.

For another Indian, Audi Ameya, a defeat to second seeded Russian Pavel Ponkratov did not hurt as much since he gained an International Master norm for scoring six points against strong rivals in the tournament.

On Thursday, some more Indian norm-aspirants will be looking for victories in the final round to make the cut.

5,2020/01/16,Tata Steel Masters | Carlsen sets another world record; Anand draws with Yu Yangyi,"Magnus Carlsen set a world record of 111 unbeaten classical games after getting out of trouble against local Jorden van Foreest during their 45-move draw in the fourth round of Tata Steel Masters chess tournament at WIJK AAN ZEE on Tuesday. On a day when Viswanathan Anand drew with black pieces against China's Yu Yangyi in 32 moves to reach 1.5 points, Carlsen’s record remained the talking point.

Carlsen, who last lost a game in July 2018 to Azerbaijan’s Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, broke the record of 110 games set by Russia’s Sergei Tiviakov in 2005. Indeed, Carlsen’s performance came against a much higher quality of opposition that averaged over 2700 as compared to Tiviakov’s rivals, at 2476.

The record could have been Carlsen’s two games before but he declined to include two victories he posted in the recent Norwegian league by saying, “I’m all for it (the record), too. I consider my streak against elite opposition is 109 and against good opposition is 111 and I am happy about that.”

But after escaping some trouble against van Foreest and then drawing the game, Carlsen well and truly held another world record in his glittering career.

After four rounds, before Wednesday’s rest day, Wesley So led the field after beating overnight leader Alireza Firouzja in 47 moves. In Group B, Surya Shekhar Ganguly defeated Dinara Saduakassova in 26 moves to lead with three points. Compatriot Nihal Sarin (2.5 points), who also played black, recorded his first win after facing local Dutchman Max Warmerdam for 38 moves and shared the second spot with four others.

Fourth-round results

Masters: Yu Yangyi (Chn, 1) drew with Viswanathan Anand (1.5); Wesley So (USA, 3) bt Alireza Firouzja (FIDE, 2.5); Jorden van Foreest (Ned, 2.5) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 2); Jeffery Xiong (USA, 2.5) drew with Fabiano Caruana (USA, 2.5); Daniil Dubov (Rus, 2) drew with Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Pol, 2); Anish Giri (Ned,) drew with Nikita Vitiugov (Rus,); Vladislav Artemiev (Rus, 2.5) bt Vladislav Kovalev (Blr, 0.5).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/sc78di/article29872387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CARLSEN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/carlsen-sets-another-world-record-anand-draws-with-yu-yangyi/article30573205.ece

9,2020/01/16,Players lash out at Australian Open officials,"Britain’s Liam Broady on Thursday lashed out at Australian Open officials for insisting qualifying take place this week despite toxic smoke from bushfires, telling fellow players: “We can’t let this go.”

Air quality in Melbourne was among the worst on the planet on Tuesday and described as “hazardous” by city authorities following months of blazes that have devastated huge swathes of the country.

It was recommended that people and their pets stay indoors, but qualifying for the opening Grand Slam of the year went ahead regardless.

Slovenian Dalila Jakupovic was forced to retire while leading in her match after a distressing coughing fit, saying she was “really scared that I would collapse”.

Other qualifiers also suffered, with World No. 234 Broady taking to Twitter to claim “multiple” players needed asthma medication, despite never having suffered from the ailment before.

Blood boiling

“The more I think about the conditions we played in a few days ago the more it boils my blood,” Broady wrote.

He called an email from governing body the ATP and the Australian Open defending the decision to go ahead with qualifying matches “a slap in the face.”

“We can’t let this slide. The email we received yesterday ... was a slap in the face, conditions were ‘playable’ Were they ‘healthy’?” he said.

“Citizens of Melbourne were warned to keep their animals indoors the day I played qualifying, and yet we were expected to go outside for high intensity physical competition?

“What do we have to do to create a players union? Where is the protection for players, both male and female?”

German player Dustin Brown, knocked out by top seed Dennis Novak in qualifying on Wednesday when conditions were better but still poor, appeared to agree with Broady in a social media reply to him.

“In 35 Years, Its The 1st Time I Had 2 Use An Asthma Spray 2 Help Me Breathe Better,” he wrote.

Canadian former World No. 25 Vasek Pospisil, who has slid down the rankings after back surgery last year, also got on board, tweeting: “We won’t let it go.” Mandy Minella, the world number 140 from Luxembourg, has previously said she was “shocked” that qualifying took place.

Tennis Australia chief Craig Tiley said this week decisions on whether to play were made after consultations with their medical team, the Bureau of Meteorology and Environment Protection Authority Victoria scientists.

“This is a new experience for all of us in how we manage air quality, so we have to listen to the experts,” he told reporters on Tuesday.

The top stars of the game haven’t been affected, completing their practice sessions on Rod Laver Arena with the roof closed. None of them have commented on qualifying being allowed to go ahead.

“On tour we let so many things go that aren’t right, but at some point we have to make a stand,” said Broady.

“All players need protection, not just a select few.”

12,2020/01/16,"Bose to close retail stores in N. America, Europe, Aus, Japan","Bose Corporation, which mostly sells audio equipment, is shutting all its 119 retail stores worldwide across Australia, North America, Europe, and Japan as its other products “are increasingly purchased online”. Hundreds of staffers will be laid off as a result.

The company has said it will be closing 119 of its “remaining” stores in North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia over the next few months.

However, about 130 stores will remain open in Greater China and the United Arab Emirates, as well as additional stores in India, Southeast Asia, and South Korea, ZDNet reported on Wednesday.

“Originally, our retail stores gave people a way to experience, test, and talk to us about multi-component, CD and DVD-based home entertainment systems,” Bose Vice President of Global Sales Colette Burke was quoted as saying.

According to reports, Bose said it will offer outplacement assistance and severance to affected staffers.

But the company is keeping additional details, including the number of employees affected, private.

Bose opened its first physical retail store in 1993 and currently has locations in many shopping centres and the remaining malls scattered across the US.

The stores are used to showcase their line up, which has grown beyond Bose’s signature noise-cancelling headphones in recent years to include smart speakers and sunglasses that double up as earbuds.

There are often similar demo areas at retailers like Best Buy, though Bose has plenty of competition to worry about in that environment, according to The Verge.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gtqnk8/article30575063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THBOSEHEADPHONES,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/bose-to-close-retail-stores-in-n-america-europe-aus-japan/article30575065.ece
13,2020/01/16,"Dating apps share intimate data about users, says consumer group","Popular dating apps like Grindr and OkCupid share personal data about users, including their location and sexuality, with about 100 other businesses, a Norwegian consumer group said on Tuesday, as it filed a complaint about breach of privacy rules.

The Norwegian Consumer Council found that 10 widely used Android apps that gather sensitive data about health, drug use, and sexual preferences passed some of it on to advertising and marketing firms without clearly informing users.

“These practices are out of control and in breach of European data protection legislation,” said Finn Myrstad, director of digital policy for the Norwegian Consumer Council.

“It is impossible for users to control this because the terms and conditions are really long and impossible to understand,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Tech companies have come under increased scrutiny over data privacy, fuelled by 2018's Cambridge Analytica scandal in which tens of millions of Facebook profiles were harvested without their users' consent.

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), implemented in 2018, heavily restricts companies' ability to process and share personal information without users' consent, with hefty fines for firms that break the rules.

The Norwegian Consumer Council filed a complaint on Tuesday against the U.S.-based gay dating app Grindr and companies receiving data from it with Norway's data authority, which said it was looking into whether they had broken GDPR rules.

Grindr said it rejected some of the report's conclusions, adding that its privacy policy was shared with all users, who had individual control over what information they chose to provide in their profiles.

“As the data protection landscape continues to change, our commitment to user privacy remains steadfast,” the company said in a statement.

The council's study found that the app, which is used by millions globally, shares data with a large number of third parties involved in advertising and profiling, many of which reserve the right to pass it on to others.

“Sharing location data for gay people can be risky in certain extreme circumstances,” Norway's data protection commissioner Bjorn Erik Thon, said in a statement.

“There are still some who do not want to be open about their orientation, and there are many countries in the world where being gay carries great risks.”

The study also found that OkCupid shares information from users' personal profiles related to sexuality, drug use and political views with an analytics company, while the dating app Tinder shares location and age with marketing firms.

The Match Group, which owns OkCupid and Tinder, said in a statement that it used third party providers to assist its services but only shared information deemed necessary to operate its platforms, in line with the applicable laws.

18,2020/01/16,Lawmakers approve Putin nominee Mishustin as PM,"Russia’s lawmakers approved Mikhail Mishustin as Prime Minister on Thursday in a lower house vote, less than 24 hours after President Vladimir Putin nominated him for the role.

His elevation is part of a sweeping shake-up of the political system announced by Putin on Wednesday, which led to the resignation of Dmitry Medvedev as Prime Minister along with his government.

Mr. Mishustin received 383 votes of 424 cast, with no votes against and 41 abstentions in a victory that had been all but assured when he won the unanimous backing of his party, United Russia, which has a strong majority in the chamber.

The 53-year-old Mishustin is a career bureaucrat who has worked as the tax chief for the past 10 years, keeping a low profile and showing no political ambitions. He has won a good reputation among experts who praised him for boosting tax collection and streamlining Russia’s rigid tax administration system.

‘Serious changes’

Mr. Putin told Russia’s political elite in his annual state-of-the-nation speech that he favoured changing the Constitution to hand the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, the power to choose the prime minister and other key positions.

“These are very serious changes to the political system,” Mr. Putin said.

“It would increase the role and significance of the country’s Parliament... of parliamentary parties, and the independence and responsibility of the Prime Minister.”

‘Rule for life’?

The reshuffle sent shock waves through Russia’s political elites, who were left pondering what Mr. Putin’s intentions were and speculating about future Cabinet appointments.

Mr. Putin has been in power longer than any other Russian or Soviet leader since Josef Stalin, who led from 1924 until his death in 1953. Under the current law, Mr. Putin must step down when his current term ends.

Critics have long accused Mr. Putin, a former KGB officer, of plotting to stay on in some capacity after his term ends and continue to wield power over the world’s largest nation, which is also one of its two leading nuclear powers.

The constitutional reform proposals, which he set out on Wednesday and suggested should be put to a referendum, would give him the option of taking an enhanced role as Prime Minister after 2024 or a new role as head of the State Council, an official body he said he was keen to build up. Putin could even become speaker of a new, supercharged Parliament.

Mr. Putin suggested amending the Constitution to allow lawmakers to name Prime Ministers and Cabinet members. The president currently holds the authority to make those appointments.

At the same time, Mr. Putin argued that Russia would not remain stable if it were governed under a parliamentary system. The President should retain the right to dismiss the PM and Cabinet Ministers, to name top defence and security officials, and to be in charge of the Russian military and law enforcement agencies, he said.

Opposition politician Leonid Volkov said it looked as though Mr. Putin was digging in.

“It’s clear to everyone that everything is going exclusively towards setting Putin up to rule for life,” he wrote on social media.

The Kommersant business daily on Thursday called Putin’s shake-up “the January revolution”. The proposals looked, Kommersant wrote, like the start of many more changes to come.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/omegwd/article30578345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-ikhail-Mishustin,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lawmakers-approve-putin-nominee-mishustin-as-pm/article30578346.ece

China, Pakistan’s ‘all-weather ally’, on Wednesday stood alone in the Pakistani corner to get the Security Council to focus on the Kashmir issue.

The latest attempt failed as other countries of the 15-member council felt Kashmir is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan.

Earlier, China made the fresh pitch to raise the Kashmir issue under ‘other matters’ during closed consultations in the Security Council Consultations Room.

“We once again saw an effort made by one member state of the UN, fail in plain view of all others,” India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Syed Akbaruddin said.

“We are happy that neither alarmist scenario painted by the representatives of Pakistan nor any of the baseless allegations made repeatedly by representatives of Pakistan in the UN fora were found to be credible today,” said Mr. Akbaruddin

“We are glad that the effort was viewed as a distraction and it was pointed by many friends that bilateral mechanisms are available to raise and address issues that Pakistan may have in its ties with India,” he added.

A European source, heading into the UNSC meeting, described the discussions on Kashmir during the closed consultations to be ‘low key.’

A top European diplomat said the issue should be resolved bilaterally and that it was a domestic affair.

Mr. Akbaruddin further said, “Pakistan’s practice of using false pretences to distract from addressing the malaise that afflicts it has run its course. We hope that Pakistan pays heed to the clear signals sent out here today and focusses on the hard tasks it has to address in order to ensure normal relations with India.”

Coming out of the meeting, Chinese Ambassador Zhang Jun said, “We had a meeting on Jammu and Kashmir. And, I’m sure you all know that Foreign Minister of Pakistan wrote letters to the Security Council asking it to pay attention to the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir.”

Mr. Jun later said, “China has stated its position very clearly. We remain concerned about the situation on the ground (in Kashmir).” When asked if the meeting advanced anything, he said,” I am sure the meeting will help both the parties to understand the risk of further escalation and will encourage them to approach each other and have a dialogue and seek solutions through dialogue. I think that will be helpful.”

The current move by China was the third such attempt to raise the Kashmir issue at the UNSC since August, last when the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was scrapped by the government, and the state was bifurcated into two union territories.

In August, China pushed for a UNSC meeting on Kashmir. However, the meeting did not yield desired results for China, as the member-states maintained that India’s move was an internal issue. Last month, France, United States, United Kingdom and Russia foiled an attempt by China to discuss Kashmir at a closed-door meeting of the UNSC.

China has criticised New Delhi for making Ladakh a union territory and lays claim over several parts of Ladakh.

“An internationally recognised dispute, Jammu and Kashmir remains on the Security Council’s agenda and its consideration by the Council reflects a recognition of the seriousness of the prevailing situation,” said Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan.

Mr. Khan also said that the issue must be resolved in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the will of the people of Kashmir. “We will continue to provide moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people until they secure their inalienable right to self-determination,” he added.

Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi claimed that the UN has confirmed during its meeting on Kashmir that India’s action of scrapping Jammu and Kashmir’s special status has increased tension in the region.

“In the closed meeting of the Council, representatives of the UN and the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), briefed the participants. The UN in its briefing confirmed that India’s August 5 measures resulted in the rise of tensions and that the ‘local situation’ remains tense,” Mr. Qureshi said.

India maintains that the UNMOGIP, established in January 1949, has outlived its utility and is irrelevant after the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the Line of Control.

“The UNSC is monitoring the situation,” said Mr. Qureshi, who is on a three-day visit to the US as a part of Pakistan’s efforts to defuse the tensions between US and Iran.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/india-slams-pakistan-for-repeatedly-trying-to-raise-the-kashmir-issue-at-unsc/article30576703.ece
20,2020/01/16,Musharraf challenges special court’s decision in SC,"Pakistan’s self-exiled former dictator Pervez Musharraf on Thursday challenged in the Supreme Court a special tribunal’s verdict that found him guilty of high treason and handed him a death sentence, according to a media report.

The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had filed the treason case against the former army chief in 2013 over the imposition of an extra-constitutional emergency in November 2007, which led to the confinement of a number of superior court judges in their houses and sacking of over 100 judges.

The special court in Islamabad on December 17 last handed down the death penalty to the 74-year-old retired general, now based in Dubai, after six years of hearing the high-profile treason case against him.

However, on Monday, Musharraf’s trial in the high treason case was declared as “unconstitutional”, leading to the annulment of the death sentence against the ex-Army chief.

In a 90-page appeal, the former military called for the order of the special court to be set aside, the Dawn newspaper reported.

“Any other remedy that the honourable court deems fit and proper may also be granted,” the appeal said.

News Analysis: What does Musharraf’s death sentence mean for Pakistan

The petition stated that the former president’s absence from the special court was not intentional and he was unable to appear before the court as he was suffering ill health, the Express Tribune reported.

It further stated that the special court had accepted Musharraf’s ailment but convicted the former president in absentia.

Musharraf, who has been living in Dubai since March 2016, left Pakistan for medical treatment and has not returned since, citing security and health reasons.

Dr. Muhammad Amjad, Musharraf’s close aide and the ex-chairperson of the All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) party, had said that the former president was rapidly becoming weaker due to an unknown disease, which is why he was unable to return to Pakistan to face the treason case.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article21153632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29-MIB-RATHORGLQ2UV0HP3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/musharraf-challenges-special-courts-decision-in-sc/article30576193.ece
21,2020/01/16,"Sri Lankan academics, activists ‘deeply concerned’ by CAA, NRC","Academics and activists from Sri Lanka have condemned the Indian government’s recent decisions to introduce the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and have expressed solidarity with those protesting against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

In a statement signed by nearly 50 university teachers and researchers, including from the Universities of Jaffna (Northern Province), Peradeniya (Central Province), Kelaniya (near Colombo, Western Province), Ruhuna (Southern Province), the Open University of Sri Lanka and the University of Visual and Performing Arts, said they were “shocked by the recent attacks on democratic freedoms in India.”

“Since the introduction of the discriminatory Citizenship (Amendment) Act in India, we have seen courageous protests emerge all over India by people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds. They, particularly university students, have stood up for democracy, a testament to the long and inspiring democratic tradition in India.”

Voicing concern over the “repeated targeted attacks” on university campuses, including the Jamia Millia Islamia, the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and most recently the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the academics noted that “such authoritarian repression and fascist assaults are deeply worrying as they undermine freedoms of expression and association in university spaces, which are a crucial bastion for dissent.”

Observing that it was heartening to see progressive Indian university students “boldly coming forward to defend democratic ideals”, the university teachers said that anti-minority discourse, seen often in Islamophobic attacks, coupled with shrinking intellectual freedom, was spreading in South Asia. “Just as we have a progressive history of struggles for social justice and democratic rights in the region, which have nourished each other’s countries, authoritarian consolidation and chauvinistic attacks in India portend danger for the entire region,” they warned, urging people of South Asia to protect democratic freedoms “in the face of rising authoritarian and nationalist forces” in the subcontinent.

In a separate statement, Sri Lanka-based defenders of rights of LGBTIQ persons said they were “deeply concerned” by the promise of the ruling BJP-government to implement the NRC across India, after it was ‘piloted’ in Assam.

“We condemn all attempts to implement the NRC, and absolutely condemn the attempt to implement it nationally. We believe it goes against the secular and democratic nature of the modern state of India as we know it,” the activists said. “As we saw in Assam, it was exclusionary to transpersons, where around 2,000 trans persons were not on the final list. The NRC in Assam forced persons to choose between ‘male’ and ‘female’ and further excluded those who could not produce original family documents, from before 1971,” they added.

Commenting on the CAA, the activists from organisations, including the Colombo-based Women and Media Collective, Jaffna Sangam, the Community Welfare and Development Fund and Chathra: Sri Lanka LGBTIQ Network, said the CAA “explicitly discriminates against those from the Muslim community.”

“We are worried that this is simply a consolidation of a larger campaign to claim India as a country for Hindus, by casting doubt on the citizenship, patriotism and loyalty of Muslims, Dalits, Adivasis and others. These laws are extremely dangerous to people belonging to minorities both within and outside India,” the statement said.

“As Sri Lankans, we are all too aware of the realities of fleeing war and persecution, as well as the consequences of discriminatory citizenship law (The Ceylon Citizenship Act of 1948 explicitly excluded Sri Lankan Tamils of South Indian origin from citizenship),” it further added. “Many thousands of Sri Lankan Tamils also fled the civil war in Sri Lanka and have found safety in India. We are deeply concerned about what would become of these communities, and others like them, were the CAA and the NRC to be implemented as they are also excluded from the terms of citizenship,” the activists said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lankan-academics-activists-deeply-concerned-by-caa-nrc/article30575228.ece
22,2020/01/16,"Philippine volcano's quakes, cracks send more people fleeing","A Philippine volcano belched smaller plumes of ash but shuddered continuously with earthquakes and opened cracks in roads on Thursday as police blockaded at-risk towns due to fears of a bigger eruption.

A crater lake and nearby river have dried up in signs of the Taal volcano’s continuing restiveness, and officials have warned people against speculating the five-day eruption is waning. Soldiers and police blocked villagers from sneaking back by boats to the volcanic island and nearby towns to retrieve belongings, poultry and cattle.

Many houses and farms have been damaged by volcanic ash since the eruption started Sunday, though no deaths or major injuries have been reported after tens of thousands of people evacuated. The volcano in Batangas province lies more than 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of the capital, Manila.

Amid warnings of an imminent and more dangerous eruption, police cordoned off at least four towns along or near the coast of a lake surrounding volcano island, sparking arguments with villagers.

""We’ve lost everything, our house got damaged, but I need to retrieve my pots and cooking wares and other things. They should not be very, very strict,” 59-year-old Erlinda Landicho told .

Ms. Landicho, who fled with her son from Lemery municipality as the volcano erupted, was among a throng of villagers stopped by police from reentering the ash-blanketed town. A firetruck blocked a key access road and police set up checkpoints. Beyond the barricade, Lemery looked like a ghost town partly shrouded in swirling ash.

More than 121,000 people fled their homes just in Batangas province, which has declared a state of calamity to allow faster releases of emergency funds. At least 373 evacuation sites were crammed with displaced villagers and needed more ash masks, portable toilets, bottled water and sleeping mats, according to a provincial disaster-response office.

The government’s main-disaster agency reported a little more than 65,000 people were displaced by the eruption in Batangas and Cavite province. The reason for the discrepancy was not immediately clear.

Among those displaced were about 5,000 people who live on the island where the Taal volcano lies. The island had been a popular tourist destination for its stunning view of the volcano’s crater lake and lush hills teeming with trees and birds. Some villagers have slipped past checkpoints to retrieve some of the hundreds of cows and horses they left behind, prompting the coast guard and police to intensify a security cordon.

A villager who returned from the island described to AP how the island now resembles an ash-blanketed wasteland. About four villages exist on the island despite it being a permanent danger zone. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana has recommended that villagers should not be allowed back.

The 1,020-foot (311-meter) Taal is one of the world’s smallest volcanoes but also one of the most restive of 24 active volcanoes across the Philippines.

23,2020/01/16,"Philippine volcano shows signs of calming, but danger remains","A Philippine volcano that has been spewing ash for days appeared to be calming down on Thursday, but seismologists said the danger of an eruption remained high and authorities warned evacuees not to return to their homes.

Some residents took advantage of what they perceived as a lull in the activity of Taal, one of the country's most active and deadliest volcanoes, to return home even though a 14 km (nine mile) exclusion zone remained in place.

“We are analysing what this seeming calm of the volcano means,” Maria Antonia Bornas, chief science research specialist at the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), told reporters.

The lake inside Taal has dried up, Ms. Bornas said, which was to be expected since it began spewing lava fountains a day after it shot giant clouds of ash miles into the air on Sunday.

Phivolcs said volcanic activity had “generally waned to weak emission of steam-laden plumes”. Even so, it had recorded more than 100 tremors since Wednesday, meaning magma was still rising.

More than 53,000 residents have abandoned their homes around Taal to take shelter in evacuation centres, but thousands more are refusing to leave or have already drifted back to check on their animals and possessions.

Power has been restored in some areas in nearby Tagaytay city where business owners were cleaning away the ash and preparing to start trading again.

Although Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes at only 311 meters (1,020 feet) high, it can be deadly. One eruption killed more than 1,300 people in 1911.

Taal has erupted more than 30 times in the past five centuries, with the most recent in 1977.

24,2020/01/16,Australian government used public funds to target marginal electorates: auditor report,"Australia's conservative government used a A$100 million ($69 million) sport development fund to target votes in marginal electorates ahead of an election last year, the country's independent auditor of public spending has concluded.

Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison secured re-election in May 2019, defying polls that had indicated voters would punish the conservative government for the backbench revolt that ousted former leader Malcolm Turnbull in 2018.

Looking to regain lost support in the run-up to the election, Mr. Morrison's government promised increased spending on local sport, but the Australian National Audit Office said late on Tuesday that then Minister for Sport Bridget McKenzie used the public funds to win favour with voters.

The report said 400 projects received funding. The Australian National Audit Office said more than 70% of those that received funding had done so without any endorsement by the governing body for sport in Australia.

“The award of funding reflected the approach documented by the minister's office of focusing on 'marginal' electorates held by the Coalition as well as those electorates held by other parties or independent members that were to be targeted by the Coalition at the 2019 election,” the report read.

The report fuels pressure on Mr. Morrison, who is already struggling under a barrage of criticism over his government's handing of ragging bushfires that have destroyed an area the size of Bulgaria. Ms. McKenzie did not dispute the findings of the report, though she insisted no rules had been broken.

“Ministerial discretion was actually written into the guidelines for a purpose,” McKenzie told Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio. Right now, as a result of our investment, parents are watching their kids get active on a Saturday morning.”

Australia's current Minister for Sport Richard Colbeck said the government would take action on the audit's findings, though he did not specify what changes would be made.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1qzdqj/article30573379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/scott,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australian-government-used-public-funds-to-target-marginal-electorates-auditor-report/article30573380.ece
25,2020/01/16,China hopes UN meeting spurs India-Pakistan talks on Kashmir,"China’s U.N. ambassador warned on Wednesday against further escalation between India and Pakistan over the disputed Kashmir region and expressed hope that a Security Council meeting called by Beijing will encourage both countries to seek a solution through dialogue.

Zhang Jun told several reporters after the closed meeting that China remains “concerned about the situation on the ground” in Kashmir.

""I’m sure the meeting will be a help in both parties to understand the risk of further escalation and encourage them to approach to each other and to have dialogue and to seek means to seek solutions through dialogue,” Mr. Zhang said.

The latest flareup was sparked by Indian government’s decision to revoke Article 370 on August 5 and following shut down in the Valley. Council diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity because Wednesday’s meeting was closed, said China wanted a review of the U.N. observer mission in Kashmir. But the overwhelming number of countries on the 15-member council urged deescalation and said the dispute is bilateral and should be resolved by India and Pakistan.

Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told reporters late on Wednesday after meeting U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that some measures taken by India after Aug. 5 have caused heightened tensions and are threatening international peace and security in south Asia. The situation is “very delicate and could spin out of control,” he warned.

""Pakistan has never shied away from a bilateral engagement, but unfortunately the Indians are not prepared to engage,” Mr. Qureshi said, alleging that as soon as Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan came to power in August 2018, he made overtures to India which were unfortunately rebuffed.

The Pakistani minister said the fact that the Security Council discussed Kashmir for the second time in five months is a clear indication that the U.N.’s most powerful body recognizes the issue is on their agenda - “and the impression that India tries to give that this is an internal matter is not correct.”

Mr. Qureshi said secretary-general António Gutteres was concerned and knows “the issue cannot be shoved under the carpet.” The U.N. chief’s spokesman said in a brief statement after the meeting that Mr. Guterres “reiterated the importance of maintaining peace and stability in South Asia through political dialogue, diplomatic solutions and respect for human rights.”

Even though Security Council members said Kashmir should be discussed and resolved bilaterally, Qureshi said, “the issue is allowed to fester the way it is festering, then it can grow into a situation which is untenable and willy nilly they will have to step in.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6m2ez2/article29113301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UNSC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-hopes-un-meeting-spurs-india-pakistan-talks-on-kashmir/article30573291.ece

27,2020/01/16,3 African nations reach preliminary deal in Nile dam dispute,"Officials from Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan say they have reached a preliminary agreement aimed at clearing the way for the filling and operation of a $5 billion dam project on the Nile River.

The Foreign Ministers and Water Resources officials of the three countries concluded three days of meetings in Washington on Wednesday with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and World Bank President David Malpass.

The project, called the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, is around 70% complete and promises to provide much needed electricity for Ethiopia’s 70 million people.

However, Egyptian officials are concerned that filing the reservoir behind the dam could significantly reduce the amount of Nile water available to Egypt.

The discussions this week were aimed at developing the rules and guidelines that would mitigate drought conditions based on the natural flow of the Nile and water release rates from the dam’s reservoir.

In a joint statement, officials from the three countries said that they had agreed that the filing of the damn should be done in stages during the rainy season, which generally runs from July to August.

The guidelines said that filing the reservoir could continue into September under certain conditions with the goal of achieving the early generation of electricity while providing mitigation measures for Egypt and Sudan in case of severe droughts.

“The ministers agree that there is a shared responsibility of the three countries in managing drought and prolonged drought,” the officials said in their joint statement.

The joint statement said these preliminary decisions on the damn’s operation will not become final until the countries agree on all points in a final operating agreement. The countries plan to meet again in Washington on January 28-29 with the goal of reaching a final agreement on the dam’s filing and operation.

“The ministers recognize the significant regional benefits that can result from concluding an agreement ... with respect to trans-boundary cooperation, regional development and economic integration,” the joint statement said.

In an address to the United Nations General Assembly last fall, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi said he would never allow Ethiopia to impose a “de facto situation” by filing the dam without an agreement on its operation.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article22281400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EGYPTNILEETHIOPIAMASSIVEDAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3-african-nations-reach-preliminary-deal-in-nile-dam-dispute/article30573265.ece
28,2020/01/16,Turkish news agency says staff members detained in Cairo,"Turkey’s state-run news agency said on Wednesday that Egyptian police raided its office in Cairo and detained four of its staff members.

Anadolu Agency said it had no information on where its employees, including one Turkish citizen, were taken following the raid late Tuesday. The Turkish citizen is in charge of the office’s finances and management.

Egyptian security forces shut down the agency’s security cameras and internet and searched the premise overnight, the agency reported. The workers’ passports, cell phones and computers were confiscated, it said, adding that no explanation was given to the agency’s lawyer. Turkey’s Foreign Ministry condemned the raid, demanded the immediate release of the Anadolu employees and summoned the top Egyptian diplomat in protest, a ministry official said.

""The raid last night by the Egyptian security forces on the Anadolu Agency Cairo bureau and the detention of some of the office workers without justification amounts to harassment and intimidation against Turkish media,” the ministry said in a statement.

""We expect Egyptian authorities to immediately release the detained employees,” the ministry added.

It also blamed Western nations for the raid, accusing them of “turning a blind eye” to rights violations in Egypt. In a sharply worded statement, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry expressed its “total and complete rejection” of Turkey’s response, and defended its security forces for acting lawfully. It said Turkey’s concerns over press freedom in Egypt obscured the country’s own rampant violations of free speech and human rights.

Egypt’s Interior Ministry said it targeted the news agency as part of its “efforts to expose the plots of the terrorist Muslim Brotherhood and the countries supporting it.”

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Islamist party has long backed the Muslim Brotherhood, now outlawed and underground in Egypt. The countries had close ties during the one-year presidency of Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood figure whose divisive rule sparked mass protests. As Defense Minister, Abdel Fattah el-Sissi led the military’s removal of Morsi, and has since branded the group an enemy of the state.

The ministry accused Anadolu of spreading “false news with the aim of distorting Egypt’s image.” It said security forces raided an apartment in the heart of Cairo that Anadolu used as a makeshift office, and arrested the four employees, including two journalists, for investigation. The incident reflects rising tensions between Turkey and Egypt.

As part of a broader regional rivalry, Turkey and Egypt back opposing sides in Libya’s chaotic war. In a bid to boost its influence in the eastern Mediterranean, Ankara recently signed security and maritime agreements with Libya’s embattled U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli. The deals prompted particular outrage in Egypt, which supports Gen. Khalifa Hifter’s eastern forces. Egypt sees Turkey as a threat to its drilling, pipeline and other maritime rights in the Mediterranean Sea.

In recent years, Egyptian authorities have jailed dozens of Egyptian reporters and occasionally expelled foreign journalists from the country. Egypt remains among the world’s worst jailers of journalists, along with Turkey and China, according to The Committee to Protect Journalists, a U.S.-based watchdog.

""Journalists operating in Egypt should not have to work in fear that they will be used to settle political scores between countries,” said Sherif Mansour, the Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for CPJ.

The group urged Egyptian authorities to release agency staffers and “stop using false news charges to harass and silence the media.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/turkish-news-agency-says-staff-members-detained-in-cairo/article30573248.ece
29,2020/01/16,Judge halts Trump’s order allowing states to block refugees,"A federal judge on Wednesday halted President Donald Trump’s executive order that gave state and local officials the ability to shut the door on refugees, and ignited a fierce debate in communities about how welcoming the United States should be.

U.S. District Judge Peter Messitte in Maryland said in his ruling that the president’s order “flies in the face of clear Congressional intent” of the 1980 Refugee Act by allowing state and local governments to block the resettlement of refugees in their jurisdictions.

In issuing a preliminary injunction, Mr. Messitte said the process should continue as it has for nearly 40 years, with refugee resettlement agencies deciding where a person would best thrive.

Church World Service, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and HIAS — a Jewish nonprofit — filed the lawsuit in Greenbelt, Maryland, on November 21. They said they already work closely with state and local officials before resettling refugees in an area.

They called the order an attempt at a state-by-state ban on refugees.

Mr. Messitte agreed. “It grants them veto power. Period,” the judge wrote.

The Trump order, which was issued in September and had been set to go into effect in June, required agencies to get written consent from state and local officials before resettling refugees in their jurisdictions. Trump said he acted to respect communities that believe they do not have the jobs or other resources to be able to take in refugees.

The White House said in a statement that the ruling was preposterous“and that Congress under the Refugee Act afforded the president authority over the refugee resettlement process.

“Another lawless district court has asserted its own preferred immigration policy in place of the laws of the United States — and, in so doing, robbed millions of American citizens of their voice and their say in a vital issue directly affecting their communities,” the statement said.

The order was the latest attempt by the Trump administration to thrust states and cities into immigration policy. It caused heated debates and raucous meetings in several towns from North Dakota to Tennessee, and put Republican governors in an uncomfortable position between immigration hardliners who want to shut the door and some Christian evangelicals who believe helping refugees is a moral obligation. Others say refugees are vital to fill jobs and keep rural communities afloat.

Trump has brought the order up on the campaign trail. At a Minneapolis rally in October, he said Washington leaders had sent large numbers of refugees to your state from Somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers.” The ruling comes less than a week after Texas became the first state to say it did not want more refugees.

Governor Greg Abbott said in a letter released January 10 that Texas, which took in more refugees than any other state during the 2018 fiscal year, “has been left by Congress to deal with disproportionate migration issues resulting from a broken federal immigration system.” Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment on Wednesday’s ruling.

30,2020/01/16,Lebanon protests turn violent for second night,"Protests in Lebanon turned violent for a second night on January 15, with dozens injured after Lebanese security forces used batons and tear gas to forcefully break up demonstrations.

Lebanon has been swept by a wave of mostly peaceful protests aimed at the country's elite that prompted Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to resign on Oct. 29, pushing the country deeper into economic crisis.

On January 14 night, riots broke out in Beirut's Hamra area, with bank facades smashed and stones pelted at security forces who fired back with tear gas.

The unrest continued on January 15 when anti-government protesters hurled stones and fireworks at security forces outside a Beirut police station where some demonstrators were being detained from the night before.

Police dispersed the protests with batons and tear gas.

The Lebanese Red Cross said that 45 people had been injured, 35 of whom had been transferred to hospitals for treatment.

Security forces injured a Reuters video journalist who was treated in hospital and released. Lebanese broadcasters Al Jadeed and MTV said security forces injured a cameraman for each of them as well.

Lebanon's internal security forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a statement caretaker interior minister Raya al-Hassan condemned the violence and called on demonstrators to remain peaceful.

“We do not accept the attack of journalists which are doing their duty to cover events and developments, nor do we accept the attack of security forces which are maintaining security,” Mr. Hassan said.

Washington has for weeks been calling on the militants to reduce violence, posing it as a condition for resuming formal negotiations on an agreement that would see U.S. troops begin to leave the country in return for security guarantees, after a near two-decade fight.

“It is an offer for a ceasefire either for seven or 10 days,” a senior Taliban official who requested anonymity told AFP, adding that the offer was made to U.S. negotiators in Doha. “It has been finalised and given to the Americans. It is going to pave the way for an agreement.”

A second insurgent source, based in Pakistan, confirmed that the offer had been handed to the U.S.

The Taliban have yet to release an official statement, and Washington has not said whether it has received any offer from the insurgents or what its response will be.

The Taliban and the U.S. had been negotiating the deal for a year, and were on the brink of an announcement in September 2019 when President Donald Trump abruptly declared the process “dead”, citing Taliban violence.

Talks were later restarted between the two sides in December in Qatar, but were paused again following an attack near the Bagram military base in Afghanistan, which is run by the U.S.

On Saturday, two Americans were killed in a Taliban-claimed bomb blast targeting a U.S. forces vehicle in southern Kandahar.

‘Positive signal’

The insurgents' offer, if accepted by the Americans, could see the negotiations begin again.

Graeme Smith, a senior consultant with International Crisis Group, called the reports of a temporary ceasefire a “positive signal”, saying a recent reduction of attacks in urban centres has added weight to the process.

“The Taliban have been sending an even bigger message with their actions in recent months. Two months have passed with no major Taliban attacks in any urban zone. That pause in attacks on cities is unprecedented over the last dozen years,” said Mr. Smith.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jigu7g/article30578396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/talibanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taliban-propose-brief-afghan-ceasefire-say-sources/article30578275.ece
32,2020/01/16,"U.S., China tiptoe around holes in new trade agreement","The United States and China signed an initial trade deal on January 15 that will roll back some tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of U.S. products, defusing an 18-month row between the world's two largest economies but leaving a number of sore spots unresolved.

Beijing and Washington touted the “Phase 1” agreement as a step forward after months of start-stop talks, and investors greeted the news with relief. But there also was skepticism the U.S.-Sino trade relationship was now firmly on the mend.

The deal fails to address structural economic issues that led to the trade conflict, doesn't fully eliminate the tariffs that have slowed the global economy, and sets hard-to-achieve purchase targets, analysts and industry leaders said.

While acknowledging the need for further negotiations with China to solve a host of other problems, U.S. President Donald Trump hailed the agreement as a win for the U.S. economy and his administration's trade policies.

“Together, we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for American workers, farmers and families,” Mr. Trump said in rambling remarks at the White House alongside U.S. and Chinese officials.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He read a letter from President Xi Jinping in which the Chinese leader praised the deal as a sign the two countries could resolve their differences with dialogue.

The centerpiece of the deal is a pledge by China to purchase at least an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. farm products and other goods and services over two years, over a baseline of $186 billion in purchases in 2017, the White House said.

Commitments include $54 billion in additional energy purchases, $78 billion in additional manufacturing purchases, $32 billion more in farm products, and $38 billion in services, according to a deal document released by the White House.

Mr. Liu said Chinese companies would buy $40 billion in U.S. agricultural products annually over the next two years “based on market conditions.” Beijing had balked at committing to buy set amounts of U.S. farm goods earlier, and has inked new soybean contracts with Brazil since the trade war started.

Key world stock market indexes climbed to new records on hopes the deal would reduce tensions, but oil prices slid on doubts the pact will spur world economic growth and boost crude demand.

Soybean futures, which traded 0.4% lower throughout much of the deal signing ceremony, sank even further after Mr. Liu's remarks, a sign that farmers and traders were dubious about the purchase goals.

The deal doesn't end retaliatory tariffs on American farm exports, makes farmers “increasingly reliant” on Chinese state-controlled purchases, and doesn't address “big structural changes,” Michelle Erickson-Jones, a wheat farmer and spokeswoman for Farmers for Free Trade, said in a statement.

Mr. Trump and his economic advisers had pledged to attack Beijing's long-standing practice of propping up state-owned companies, and flooding international markets with low-priced goods as the trade war heated up.

Although the deal could be a boost to U.S. farmers, automakers and heavy equipment manufacturers, some analysts question https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL4N29J26S China's ability to divert imports from other trading partners to the United States.

“I find a radical shift in Chinese spending unlikely. I have low expectations for meeting stated goals,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group in Minneapolis. ”But I do think the whole negotiation has moved the football forward for both the U.S. and China.”

Mr. Trump, who has embraced an “America First” policy aimed at rebalancing global trade in favor of U.S. companies and workers, said China had pledged action to confront the problem of pirated or counterfeited goods, and that the Phase 1 deal included strong protection of intellectual property rights.

Earlier, top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox News the agreement would add 0.5 percentage point to U.S. gross domestic product growth in both 2020 and 2021.

Aviation industry sources said Boeing was expected to win a major order for wide-body jets from China, including its 787 or 777-9 models, or a mixture of both. Such a deal could ease pressure on the 787 Dreamliner, which has suffered from a broad downturn in demand for large jets, forcing the planemaker to trim production late last year.

Tariffs to stay

The Phase 1 deal, reached in December, canceled planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made cellphones, toys and laptop computers and halved the tariff rate to 7.5% on about $120 billion worth of other Chinese goods, including flat panel televisions, Bluetooth headphones and footwear.

But it will leave in place 25% tariffs on a vast, $250 billion array of Chinese industrial goods and components used by U.S. manufacturers, and China's retaliatory tariffs on over $100 billion in U.S. goods.

Market turmoil and reduced investment tied to the trade war cut global growth in 2019 to its lowest rate since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund said in October.

Tariffs on Chinese imports have cost U.S. companies $46 billion. Evidence is mounting that tariffs have raised input costs for U.S. manufacturers, eroding their competitiveness.

Diesel engine maker Cummins Inc said on Tuesday that the deal will leave it paying $150 million in tariffs for engines and castings that it produces in China. It urged the parties to take steps to eliminate all the tariffs.

Mr. Trump, who has been touting the Phase 1 deal as a pillar of his 2020 re-election campaign, said he would agree to remove the remaining tariffs once the two sides had negotiated a “Phase 2” agreement. He added that those negotiations would start soon.

“They will all come off as soon as we finish Phase 2,” said Mr. Trump, who added that he would visit China in the not-too-distant future.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a8pcn8/article30573218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/trump-china-trade-deal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-china-tiptoe-around-holes-in-new-trade-agreement/article30573219.ece
33,2020/01/16,U.S. House votes to send Trump impeachment to Senate for trial,"The U.S. House voted on January 15 to send two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump to the Senate and approve House prosecutors for only the third impeachment trial in American history.

The nearly party-line vote moved Mr. Trump’s impeachment from Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Democratic-run House to the Republican-majority Senate, where Mr. Trump expects acquittal, even as new evidence is raising fresh questions about his Ukraine dealings.

The vote was 228-193, coming at the start of a presidential election year and one month after the House impeached Mr. Trump. The president is charged with abuse of power over his pressure on Ukraine to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, using military aid to the country as leverage. Mr. Trump was also charged with obstructing Congress’ ensuing probe..

""We are here today to cross a very important threshold in American history,” Ms. Pelosi said, addressing the House before the vote. Earlier, she declared: “This is what an impeachment is about. The president violated his oath of office, undermined our national security, jeopardized the integrity of our elections.”

Mr. Trump, during an event at the White House, rejected the charges as a “hoax.”

The seven-member prosecution team will be led by the chairmen of the House impeachment proceedings, Reps. Adam Schiff of the Intelligence Committee and Jerry Nadler of the Judiciary Committee, two of Ms. Pelosi’s top lieutenants for only the third presidential impeachment in the nation’s history.

Ahead of the session on Jan. 15, Mr. Schiff released new records from Lev Parnas, an associate of Mr. Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, about the Ukraine strategy. including an exchange with another man about surveilling later-fired Ambassador Maria Yovanovitch.

Mr. Schiff said the new evidence should bring more pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is reluctant to allow witnesses to testify.

“If McConnell makes this the first trial in history without witnesses, it will be exposed for what it is and that is an effort to cover up for the president,” Mr. Schiff said.

Later on January 15, the House managers are to walk the articles across the Capitol to the Senate in a dramatic procession. The Senate trial is set to start on January 16.

Mr. McConnell opened the Senate dismissing what he called a rushed impeachment that is more about the politics of Democrats who don’t like Mr. Trump than the charges against him.

""This isn’t really about Ukraine policy or military money,” Mr. McConnell said. “This has been naked partisanship all along.”

During Pelosi’s press conference announcing managers, Mr. Trump tweeted that impeachment was “another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House, not the Senate!”

Trump’s trial will be only the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, and it comes against the backdrop of a politically divided nation in an election year.

The Senate is expected to transform into an impeachment court as early as Thursday, although significant proceedings wouldn’t begin until next Tuesday after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The Constitution calls for the chief justice to preside over senators, who serve as jurors and swear an oath to deliver “impartial justice.”

The managers are a diverse group with legal, law enforcement and military courtroom experience, including Hakeem Jeffries of New York, Sylvia Garcia of Texas, Val Demings of Florida, Jason Crow of Colorado and Zoe Lofgren of California.

Mr. McConnell, who is negotiating rules for the trial proceedings, is under competing pressure from his party for more witnesses, from centrists who are siding with Democrats on the need to hear full testimony and conservatives mounting Mr. Trump’s defense.

Senate Republicans signaled they would reject the idea of simply voting to dismiss the articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump, as Mr. Trump himself has suggested. Mr. McConnell agreed he does not have the votes to do that.

Mr. McConnell said on January 14: “Our members feel we have an obligation to listen to the arguments.”

A mounting number of senators say they want to ensure the ground rules include the possibility of calling new witnesses.

Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is leading an effort among some Republicans, including Mitt Romney of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska for votes on witnesses.

Mr. Romney said he wants to hear from John Bolton, the former national security adviser at the White House, who others have said raised alarms about the alternative foreign policy toward Ukraine being run by Giuliani.

Democrats have been pushing Republicans to consider new testimony, arguing that fresh information has emerged during Pelosi’s monthlong delay in transmitting the charges.

Republicans control the chamber, 53-47, and are all but certain to acquit Mr. Trump. But it takes just 51 votes during the trial to approve rules or call witnesses. Just four GOP senators could form a majority with Democrats to insist on new testimony. It also would take only 51 senators to vote to dismiss the charges against Mr. Trump.

At the private GOP lunch on January 14, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky warned that if witnesses are allowed, defense witnesses could also be called. He and other Republicans want to subpoena Mr. Biden and his son, Mr. Hunter, who served on the board of a gas company in Ukraine, Burisma, while his father was vice president.

Mr. McConnell prefers to model Mr. Trump’s trial partly on the process used for President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999. It, too, contained motions for dismissal or calling new witnesses.

Mr. McConnell is hesitant to call new witnesses who would prolong the trial and put vulnerable senators who are up for reelection in 2020 in a bind with tough choices. At the same time, he wants to give those same senators ample room to show voters they are listening.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qmd185/article30573185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPIMPEACHMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/house-votes-to-send-trump-impeachment-to-senate-for-trial/article30573186.ece

38,2020/01/16,JSW Group closes down its furniture retail business within one year of its launch,"JSW Group has closed down its furniture retail business housed under Forma brand within one year of its launch due to “faulty business model.”

Forma was launched as a brand of JSW Living Pvt. Ltd. in April last year to help the steel -to-energy- conglomerate foray into India’s fast-growing $19-billion furniture market with the aim to figure among the top five furniture brands in India.

However, dealers point out the faulty business model and immature market for steel furnitures for the failure of Forma. “The Indian market is not yet evolved for steel furnitures,” said a dealer.

A JSW Group official confirmed that the retail furniture business had to be shut down, without elaborating further. However, a spokesperson for the group declined to offer any comment.

The venture was headed by Tarini Jindal Handa—daughter of steel magnate Sajjan Jindal.

“We are learning and there is an immense distance to travel,” Ms. Handa had told The Hindu at the time of the launch. She had announced plans of investing around ₹250 crore over the next five years to the aim to achieve a revenue of ₹1,000 crore.

Meanwhile, JSW Paints led by her brother Parth Jindal is also facing problems in making inroads into the paints business as its facing tough competition from market leader Asian Paints.

On, complaints of JSW Paints, competition watchdog the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has ordered for probe against Asian Paints for allegedly threatening dealers and misusing its dominant position in the market to restrict the entry of JSW Paints in the three southern states of Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu.

“The company is currently examining the order and will take appropriate legal recourse and will extend full co-operation to CCI in the matter,” said Asian Paints in filing to the exchanges.

GMR Group will sell 49% in its airports business to TRIL Urban Transport Pvt. Ltd. (part of the Tata Group), an affiliate of GIC and SSG Capital Management, compared with the 44.44% agreed upon earlier.

TRIL Urban Transport Private Ltd. has executed an amended and restated share subscription and purchase agreement and shareholders agreement with GMR Infrastructure to increase the transaction size.

“This transaction is expected to fetch GMR Infrastructure about ₹9,000 crore. Most of the proceeds will go towards repayment of debt,” sources told The Hindu. “Of the entire proceeds, ₹1,000 crore will go Delhi Airport International Limited and the rest will go towards repayment of corporate debt,” said the source.

The firm “has decided to increase the transaction size by agreeing to divest 49% in GMR Airports Limited in one or more tranches, such closings being subject to regulatory approvals,” said GMR Infrastructure in a statement.

The company has a net debt of ₹23,900 crore as on September 2019 and is looking to deleverage by selling non- core assets.

GMR Infrastructure shares touched their 52-week high of ₹25 after the announcement before closing down 0.42% to ₹23.85 in a firm Mumbai market on Thursday, valuing the company at ₹14,395.73 crore.

The incentive will be implemented in the form of scrips, according to a Textiles Ministry notification.

The Textiles Ministry had notified a scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) on March 7, 2019 instead of the Rebate of State Levies (RoSL). The exporters were also getting nearly 4% benefit under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS).

According to the latest notification, the ad-hoc incentive is to offset the difference between RoSCTL and RoSL plus MEIS. Under this, incentive of up to 1% of FoB value for each line in a shipping bill will be provided for apparel and made up exports, during the specified period, that may receive lesser benefits under RoSCTL compared with RoSL+ MEIS.

According to Raja M. Shanmugham, president, Tiruppur Exporters’ Association, when the government announced the RoSCTL, exporters were under the impression this would be in addition to the MEIS. However, not all the exporters got the benefits under MEIS since March, 2019. This had affected the exporters. Now that the Ministry has announced the additional incentive it should be disbursed at the earliest. The government had announced that it would implement Remission of Duties or Taxes on Export Product (RoDTEP) from January this year. There is no clarity on it, he said.

42,2020/01/16,Wockhardt gets nod for drugs to treat superbugs,"The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved Wockhardt’s two new antibiotics, EMROK (IV) and EMROK O (oral), for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections, including diabetic foot infections and concurrent bacteraemia.

The approval is based on phase three study involving 500 patients in 40 centres across India.

The drugs will target super bugs such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is a leading cause of rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among patients The size of Indian antibiotic market is estimated at ₹16,000 crore, growing at 7%.

Workhardt, which will launch these drugs in India shortly, plans to capture a large part of the antibotic-resistance market which is a smaller but growing segment of the antibiotic market.

“By virtue of its broad spectrum activity against widely-prevalent pathogens, including MRSA, superior safety over the currently available anti-MRSA agents and its unique properties, I believe EMROK/EMROK-O has a strong potential to effectively address the unmet medical need of the clinicians in the country thereby helping to reduce the morbidity and mortality,” said Habil Khorakiwala, founder-chairman and group CEO, Wockhardt Ltd., said in a statement.

Murtaza Khorakiwala, MD, Wockhardt Ltd. said that India carries one of the largest burdens of drug-resistant pathogens worldwide, which the new drugs target.

“Infections caused by drug-resistant organisms could lead to increased mortality and prolonged duration of hospitalisation, causing a huge financial burden to the affected persons and hinder the goals of sustainable development,” he said

“Two million deaths are projected to occur in India due to AMR by the year 2050 and the newly-discovered drug will address this concern,” he added

“EMROK and EMROK-O are the first novel chemical entity antibiotics researched and developed in India with various international collaborations across the globe,” he added.

Clinical and non-clinical studies have established advantageous safety features of the drugs compared with older MRSA drugs, the company said.

43,2020/01/16,Will recover ₹50 crore soon: Sri Guru Raghavendra bank,"Sri Guru Raghavendra Sahakara Bank, on which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had imposed operational restrictions, on Thursday said it was confident of recovering ₹50 crore from defaulters in cash and through liquidation of collateral in the next few days.

The bank’s chief adviser Vasudeva Maiya told The Hindu, “The bank today met defaulters at a borrowers’ meet and we have asked them to pay up the money at the earliest, failing which each of these people will have to face legal action. We are confident of recovering the entire credit outstanding by March 31 this year.”

On January 10, the banking regulator had barred the bank from accepting new deposits, disbursing fresh loans or making any investments without its approval.

The RBI had also fixed the withdrawal limit at ₹35,000, spreading panic among its customers. “On Thursday, 35 defaulters, of a total of 62, attended the meeting and we will meet the rest of the borrowers on Friday. We are trying our best to resolve the issue and assure that all our customers will get their money back,” said Mr. Maiya.

Mr. Maiya added that the bank has NPAs (non-performing assets) to the tune of ₹300 crore and ₹75 crore in outstanding interest. It had collateral securities worth about ₹2,200 crore against its total loan payout of ₹1,700 crore, he said.

“The RBI has asked us to initiate legal action against borrowers refusing to pay up. We have decided to go aggressive on liquidation of collateral to recover the money,” he added.

Ramesh Babu, a director at the Karnataka State Urban Co-Op Bank Federation, said, there were 264 co-op banks as members of the federation. “However, the body has only advisory powers on its members. Co-op banks are under dual controls by the RBI and Registrar of Co-Op Societies.’’

Meanwhile, with growing concern for their savings, thousands of depositors have been flocking to the bank’s eight branches in the city since last many days. Navya, a 23-year-old, whose parents and sister are customers of the bank, said: “Sri Guru Raghavendra Sahakara Bank Niyamitha has been our family bank over the last couple of decades. But all of a sudden,we are not able to withdraw any money other than the RBI set ₹35,000. I am getting married on January 30. Forget money for jewellery and clothes, I’ve no money even to pay for my marriage hall. My parents have been saving from the year I was born. My family is so upset and embarrassed.’’

“We never know what happens. Usually, the initial glimpse of any big scam is too small or negligible. My father has over ₹25 lakh, all his retirement money, deposited in this bank. One can’t easily forget the recent big ticket scandal involving Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank,’’ said Narayan Rao, a resident of Basavanagudi.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/i0tanu/article30563506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bgbgcvrbankGH36VNR816jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/will-recover-50-crore-soon-sri-guru-raghavendra-bank/article30578878.ece
44,2020/01/16,"AMFI bats for tax sops, parity for mutual funds","The Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), in its pre-budget memorandum submitted to the government, has suggested introducing debt-linked savings schemes, lowering the holding period in gold and commodity exchange traded funds (ETFs), bringing in higher tax parity and allowing certain exemptions to mutual funds for channelising more savings into the capital market.

The mutual fund umbrella body has proposed that investments up to ₹1.5 lakh under ‘Debt Linked Savings Scheme’ or DLSS should be made eligible for tax benefit subject to a lock-in of five years – similar to a tax saving bank fixed deposit.

“DLSS will help small investors participate in bond markets at low costs and at a lower risk as compared to equity markets. This will also bring debt-oriented mutual funds on a par with tax saving bank fixed deposits, where deduction is available under Section 80C,” AMFI said in a release.

Further, for gold and commodity ETFs, the industry body has suggested lowering the holding period for exemption from long-term capital gains tax from the current three years to one year, which will bring such instruments on a par with listed debt securities.

It has also sought lowering of dividend distribution tax on debt schemes to at least bring it on a par with corporate tax rate of 22%. Currently, such tax is levied at 25% for individuals and 30% for corporates apart from surcharge and cess.

Lesser DDT will attract fresh flows into debt mutual fund schemes, especially from retirees, and can help inflow stable money into bond market through mutual fund route, the AMFI release stated.

Among other things, AMFI has also proposed that mutual fund units should be notified as ‘Specified Long-Term Assets’ that qualify for exemption of long-term capital gains. This, as per AMFI, could channelise some of the gains from sale of immovable property into capital markets.

“We are hoping this time our long-pending submissions get addressed, which would help take the Indian MF industry not only to the next level of growth but also help in contributing to making economy stronger, especially with deepening of bond market, making long term availability of funds for infrastructure growth, and reducing the fiscal deficit by shifting investments from pure gold to gold ETFs,” N.S. Venkatesh, chief executive, AMFI, said.

Some of the proposals are also aimed at bringing parity with comparable investment avenues, making mutual funds more retail investor-friendly, he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/amfi-bats-for-tax-sops-parity-for-mutual-funds/article30578876.ece
45,2020/01/16,Unclaimed telco refunds to go into consumer fund,"The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on Thursday said telecom service providers will need to deposit all unclaimed money of consumers, including excess charges and security deposit, in the Telecommunication Consumers Education and Protection Fund (TCEPF).

“The authority observed that there is a need to bring clarity among service providers in depositing money which they are unable to refund to the consumers,” TRAI said, adding that while some service providers were depositing money only on account of excess billing revealed in the audit, others were depositing unclaimed money such as security deposits and plan charges of failed activations.

“It is prudent to deposit any such unclaimed / unrefundable amount belonging to consumers in the TCEP fund as it will be utilised for the welfare measures of the consumers. Accordingly, it was felt that an amendment in the TCEPF regulation may be carried out to remove any kind of ambiguity and facilitate deposit of any unclaimed money of the consumer such as excess charges, security deposit, plan charges of failed activations, etc.,” TRAI said.

The TCEPF Regulations, 2007, which have now been amended, provide the basic framework for depositing unclaimed money of consumers by service providers, maintenance of the TCEPF and other related aspects.

“With this amendment, service providers will deposit any unclaimed consumer money of any form such as excess charges, security deposit, plan charges of failed activations, or any amount belonging to a consumer, which service providers are unable to refund to consumers, to the fund after providing time of 12 months or period of limitation specified under law whichever is later,” the authority said.

In a separate release, the regulator said that the total wireless subscribers in the country declined from 1,183.40 million at the end of October 2019 to 1,154.39 million at the end of November 2019, a monthly decline of 2.43% or 28.82 million subscribers.

As per the data, while wireless subscription in urban areas declined from 662.92 million in October to 647.33 million in November, wireless subscription in rural areas fell from 520.48 million to 507.26 million in the months under review.

Additionally, Reliance Jio was the market leader with 32.04% market share, followed by Vodafone Idea (29.12%), Bharti Airtel (28.35%), BSNL (10.19%) and MTNL (0.29%).",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/unclaimed-telco-refunds-to-go-into-consumer-fund/article30578860.ece
46,2020/01/16,Pay-as-you-drive insurance among 33 products that get nod,"From health profile-based pricing, use of wearable devices to ‘pay as you drive’ to usage-based motor insurance as well as an AI driven automotive claims and collision estimation system, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has approved 33 product proposals of insurers under a regulatory sandbox approach.

The products can hit the market as early as next month as the approval is time-bound — for six months from February 1. IRDAI had invited proposals in September and received 173. It had also set up an Evaluation Committee to evaluate the proposals related to health and motor insurance and from intermediaries. The objective behind promoting the regulatory sandbox route is to recognise innovative ideas to foster growth in insurance sector, in a way that provides flexibility in dealing with regulatory requirements and at the same time ensuring policyholder protection, according to the regulator. Among health insurers’ proposals that received approval were a comprehensive wellness programme with wearable device, short term and need-based insurance, and an app monitored diabetes mellitus wellness programme. In the non-life segment, 8 proposals pertain to a pay as you drive under the private car policy own damage segment. Two proposals of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance received approval — ‘Pay as you Consume’ for motor insurance and ‘Co-pay’ under health insurance.

MD and CEO Tapan Singhel said premium for the Own Damage component was currently based on the age, make and the vehicle model. ‘Pay as you consume’ will charge premium based on the kilometres covered by the insured or the period of time they intend to drive the car. This will encourage more people to opt for Motor OD insurance since a majority of the vehicles only have Third Party Liability policy as mandated by law.

Under the Co-pay model, he said the insurer was associating with tech enabled healthcare platform GOQii.

Based on the engagement level of the insured on the platform, the percentage of co-pay would be decided.

Edelweiss General Insurance has got approval for an app-based multi-vehicle, usage-based floater policy for Motor Own Damage. CEO and Executive Director Shanai Ghosh said the “product allows you to cover any damage to your vehicles via a floater policy. The policy will cover all risk for all vehicles and the cover can be switched on/off as per the requirement of the customer with the flexibility of adding and deleting vehicles as required.” The policy is a floater for multiple vehicles and usage-based.

What this means is that there will be premium savings for the customer as compared to having multiple policies for their vehicles. As per the sandbox guidelines the product can be launched only as a pilot and the period for launch and completion is from February 1 to July 31.

47,2020/01/16,AGR plea dismissal may hit ‘Digital India’,"With the Supreme Court dismissing the petition by telecom firms to review its October 24 order on definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), industry and experts said that the decision would hit the fund-raising and investment capability of service providers, leading to adverse impact on the NDA government’s flagship ‘Digital India’ initiative.

Expressing disappointment over the decision, Bharti Airtel on Thursday said it was evaluating the possibility of filing a curative petition. The firm added that the money required to pay the interest and penalties on the pending dues, could instead be used for serving the ‘Digital India’ initiative.

Prashant Singhal, global technology, media and telecommunications (emerging markets) leader at EY told The Hindu, “This is a big blow... while there is still some hope with the option of filing a curative petition, the sooner the uncertainty is positively resolved, the better it is for the sector.”

Mr. Singhal added that the sector needed funds for upcoming technologies such as 5G and this decision would impact telecom companies’ fund raising and investment capabilities. “This will also impact the larger telecom value chain, including the tower firms and the equipment makers, and not just the telcos,” he said.

“While respecting the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision, we would like to express our disappointment as we believe the long standing disputes raised regarding the AGR definition were bonafide and genuine,” Bharti Airtel said in a statement.

It added that the industry continued to face severe financial stress and the outcome could further erode the viability of the sector as a whole. “The industry needs to continue to invest in expanding networks, acquiring spectrum and introducing new technologies like 5G.The money now required to pay punitive interest, penalty and interest on penalty, which forms nearly 75% of AGR dues, would have better served the digital mission of the country,” it said. Following the October 24 judgment in favour of the government, the telecom companies owe the government ₹1.47 lakh crore, of which ₹92,642 crore is the license fees and ₹55,054.51 crore is spectrum usage charge.

Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are among the worst impacted by the order. In the case of Bharti Airtel, the liabilities add up to nearly ₹35,586 crore, of which ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and ₹13,904.01 crore SUC dues (excluding dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices). In the case of Vodafone Idea, the number stands at a cumulative ₹53,038 crore, including ₹24,729 crore of SUC dues and ₹28,309 crore in licence fee.

‘Exploring options’

Vodafone Idea, whose chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had earlier said that the company may have to shut shop if there was no relief on the AGR dues, informed the stock exchange that it was exploring further options, including filing a curative petition.

“The sector, which is currently reeling under a debt of ₹4 lakh crore, is a key contributor to the Indian economy... The sector is already facing heavy taxes and levies in the range of 29% to 32%, which are globally the highest,” Rajan S. Mathews, director general at Cellular Operators Association of India said. “The Supreme Court’s dismissal of the review petition is the last straw in contributing to financial distress and it remains to be seen whether the industry will be able to recover from this setback. The added pressure on the sector will also adversely impact Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of Digital India,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/qef8sp/article30578799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THBUTRAI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/agr-plea-dismissal-may-hit-digital-india/article30578800.ece
48,2020/01/16,Hirotec invests ₹100 crore in Coimbatore in last one year,"Japan-head quartered Hirotec Group, which has facilities in Coimbatore and Pune in India, had invested ₹100 crore here in the last one year developing a stamping die manufacturing facility. The group, with presence in eight countries and 29 facilities, makes automotive assembly welding fixtures, hemming, stamping dies and sheet metal parts.

In Coimbatore, the group has invested ₹180 crore in the last 14 years and makes tooling for manufacture of closures for automobile industries.

Nori Uno, president of the Hirotec Group, Senthil Parthasarathy, director of Hirotec India, and Jim Toeniskoetter, CEO, Hirotec India, told the media here on Thursday that the new stamping die manufacturing facility will build sheet metal stamping dies for the Indian market.

Automobile companies in India now buy the dies mainly from countries such as China and Korea. With the India facility, the company can compete with China as the shipping cost will reduce, Mr. Toeniskoetter said.

Though the automobile sector in India faced slowdown, it is for the existing vehicles. Hirotec supplies machinery for new cars and for the models that will be upgraded, according to Mr. Parthasarathy. In the next 10 years, Hirotec will invest ₹140 crore in Coimbatore and by 2022, provide direct employment to another 100 people.

“Our confidence is very high (in the Indian market). You can see it in our investment in Gujarat and continuous investment here,” Mr. Toeniskoetter added.

In Gujarat, the Hirotec Group and Mark Exhaust are investing approximately ₹200 crore to manufacture and supply exhaust systems to Suzuki. The Gujarat facility is expected to be commissioned in March.

49,2020/01/16,Markets eye improved transparency in Budget: DBS,"Indian financial market will look for improved transparency in the Union Budget announcements next month, according to a report by Singapore-based banking group DBS.

Any reduction in the fiscal deficit could result in a negative credit impulse in the near-term, but will need to be balanced with a credible consolidation plan further-out, according to the the bank’s research report India Budget Preview: Loosening the purse released on Thursday.

The report noted that fiscal deficit in the first eight months of FY20, stood at 15% above target, driven by weak revenues.

At an aggregate level, expenditure has been in line with the budget trend. The fiscal year-to-date (FYTD) deficit overshoot is not out of sync with past trends, it added.

This is because, typically, the fiscal run-rate worsens for three-fourths of the year and then moderates in the final quarter as expenditure is scaled back and seasonal revenue flows kick-in, wrote DBS economist Radhika Rao.

Run rate of the FY20 math, however, suggests that the 4QFY20 turnaround might be insufficient to contain a deficit slippage, Rao said.

Gross tax revenues rose by a modest 0.8%t year-on-year (YoY) in FYTD (by November), slowing from 1.2% and 1.5% in the previous two-months.

Expectations are high for non-tax revenues to provide cushion. So far, this has comprised excess RBI’s dividends (0.25% of GDP), partial payments by telecom companies following a court ruling, and divestment proceeds, wrote Rao.

Key strategic stake sale in five PSUs announced in November were an important move, but with less than a quarter left in this fiscal year, proceeds could accrue to FY21.

For FY20, by November, collections stand at ₹180 billion, compared to a target of ₹1.05 trillion (0.5% of GDP). Factoring in a late push by sale of minority stakes and ETF collections, the count could improve to ₹600 billion, yet below target.

To accommodate this revenue shortfall, we expect expenditure to be scaled back in 4QFY20, said Rao.

The Department of Economic Affairs have reportedly asked departments to compress their spending to 25% of their budgeted sum in 4QFY20 versus 33% in the past few years.

This might lead ministries who have underspent in early part of the year to witness sharper cuts in 2H.

More savings are also likely via slower disbursements under the PM Kisan scheme, deferment in subsidy payments and delay in rolling out of sectoral measures announced in 2H19, reining in expenditure.

Netting of weak revenues and expenditure cuts against the background of an undershoot in nominal GDP, a slippage of 0.3% in the deficit target is likely in FY20, according to Rao.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/iysqyj/article30573805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THDBS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets-eye-improved-transparency-in-budget-dbs/article30573806.ece
50,2020/01/16,Toyota invests $400 million in flying car company,"Japanese car giant Toyota said Thursday it is investing nearly $400 million in a company working on commercialising electric flying cars for “fast, quiet and affordable air transportation services“.

The investment in Joby Aviation comes as the automaker looks to expand into new sectors as the industry rapidly transforms, with president Akio Toyoda pledging to move the firm “from a car manufacturer to a mobility company“.

“Air transportation has been a long-term goal for Toyota, and while we continue our work in the automobile business, this agreement sets our sights to the sky,” Toyoda said in a statement announcing the investment.

“Through this new and exciting endeavour, we hope to deliver freedom of movement and enjoyment to customers everywhere, on land, and now, in the sky.”

Founded in 2009, Joby Aviation is developing a four-passenger electric aircraft that takes off and lands vertically, like a helicopter, though it has multiple rotors.

The firm envisions the aircraft as a mode of commercial transport, rather than for sale to individuals, with its pilots ferrying commuters around.

Toyota said it would also offer its “expertise in manufacturing, quality and cost controls for the development and production” of Joby’s aircraft.

One of its executive vice presidents, Shigeki Tomoyama, will join Joby’s board, playing an “active role in setting strategic direction”, Toyota said.

Joby already has a partnership with ride-sharing firm Uber to develop an “urban air taxi service“.

Toyota has ventured into the flying vehicle field elsewhere, investing in the Japanese SkyDrive project to develop what is intended to be the world’s smallest flying car.

It has also branched out into other sectors, announcing at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this month its plans for a “woven city” at the base of Mount Fuji that would be powered by hydrogen fuel cells and include roads for autonomous vehicles as well as smart homes.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/t5mbtn/article30573503.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BABRIEFTWOAGBN5B0R5E3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/toyota-investing-400-million-in-flying-car-company/article30573498.ece

Except West Bengal, the representatives of all other States have agreed to attend the meeting.

Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai will chair the meeting which will be attended by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla and Chief Secretaries and Census Directors of all States.

Also Read West Bengal, Kerala governments want NPR data collection halted

The meeting will discuss the modalities for the houselisting phase of the Census and the NPR, to be carried out from April 1 to September 30, a Home Ministry official said.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced on Wednesday that officials from the State will not attend the meeting.

Earlier, State governments of West Bengal and Kerala citing maintenance of “public order,” had communicated to the Registrar General of India (RGI) that the collection of data for updating the NPR should be halted.

The Chief Ministers have opposed the NPR exercise, which according to Citizenship Rules 2003 is the first step towards compilation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The government has said that there was no proposal for compilation of a countrywide NRC as of now.

West Bengal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Ladakh and Puducherry notified the NPR exercise last year but are yet to convey the dates to RGI. NPR will be conducted along with the Census exercise from April 1.

The new NPR form will for the first time also collect information on “mother tongue.”

The NPR will seek details on 21 parameters, seeking specific details on “place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence” along with other information like Aadhaar (optional), voter ID card, mobile phone and driving licence numbers. In 2010 and 2015, it collected details on 14 parameters.

The official said NPR enumerators will not seek any documents or verify those provided by the respondent but will merely note down the details provided by the respondent.

Data for the NPR was first collected in 2010, and updated in 2015. The decennial Census exercise will be conducted in two phases — House Listing and Housing Census from April to September 2020 and Population Enumeration from February 9 to February 28, 2021.

In a four-minute video of the meeting recorded by a student, Prof. Mansoor could be heard telling students that these were not “crocodile tears”. “My whole family regret it. I didn’t know the police would enter the hostel and guest house...” he said.

In a statement released by the university, the V-C told the students that the police should have “no role in the working of the university and law and order is to be maintained by the university”. Expressing deep regret, Prof. Mansoor said, “I deeply regret that students suffered injuries and the inconvenience they faced when they were asked to vacate hostels.”

He assured them that the university administration was fully committed to provide congenial atmosphere and security to the students.

A university spokesperson underlined that the V-C had met the students without any security cover and categorically said no innocent student would be targeted and that the university had no issue if the students peacefully protest on any provision which they find objectionable.

The V-C further urged students to cooperate with the visiting National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) team and the fact-finding committee headed by Justice (retd.) V.K. Gupta set up by the university for a detailed investigation on what all transpired on the night of December 15, in which a score of students were left injured.

In the video, the V-C could also be heard asking students about the social media post where a student has asked whether funeral prayer of General Dyer should be offered.

The students could be heard replying that as their teacher he should not focus on one post and think of the future of 32000 students.

The V-C could also be heard describing the letter to the district administration where he asked for security as a precautionary measure. “This is a government university. It puts ₹1,100 crore annually. God forbid something happened...we put the ball in their court,” he said.

A student requesting anonymity said he was not happy with the V-C’s response and expected students, which included a former president of the students’ union to present better arguments. “When you have called the police inside, how could you not follow what it was up to inside the campus,” he asked. “If he was feeling guilty, he should have addressed a larger gathering of students, not some five-six students at 7 a.m.,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ilrnnc/article30579152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-AMU-SKP-DEC15,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amu-v-c-meets-students-regrets-police-action/article30579153.ece

54,2020/01/16,Nirbhaya case: Delhi court seeks status report on execution,"A day after the Delhi government said none of the four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case could be hanged on the scheduled date of January 22 as one of them has moved a mercy plea, a Delhi court on Thursday directed Tihar jail authorities to submit a report about the status of scheduled execution.

Currently, convicts Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Kumar Singh have already exhausted their option of a curative petition before the Supreme Court against the death sentence awarded to them, while the other two — Pawan Gupta and Akshay Singh — are yet to approach the Supreme Court with their curative plea.

After facing rejection from the top court, convict Mukesh has now moved a mercy petition against his pending capital punishment before the President earlier this week. Mukesh was also the lone convict who approached the Delhi High Court against the death warrant issued to him.

The High Court on Wednesday, however, declined to entertain his petition on the ground that he should have either moved the sessions court or the apex court. Following this, Mukesh approached the Delhi court here seeking postponement of the date of his execution on the ground that his mercy petition is pending with the President.

Court questions delay

The High Court had, while hearing Mukesh’s plea, expressed displeasure over the “strategy” adopted by the four death row convicts to delay the process of execution. It had questioned counsel for convict Mukesh as to why he kept waiting for two-and-a half years and did not file curative or mercy petitions after the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal against conviction and confirmed the death sentence awarded to him by the trial court. The High Court had also pulled up the prison authorities for the delay on their part and not communicating to the convicts that they can file mercy pleas after their appeals were dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2017.

It remarked that the notice which was issued to the convicts on October 29 and December 18, 2019, by the prison authorities asking the convicts to move their mercy pleas should have been done much earlier.

Delhi government standing counsel (criminal) Rahul Mehra, representing the jail authorities, had argued that the delay was due to the fact that one of the convicts — Akshay — had not filed his review plea till 2019 and it was dismissed only on December 18 last year.

Mr. Mehra argued that as per rules, unless all the four convicts exhaust their remedy of mercy petition, the jail authorities cannot proceed.

Since becoming full-time member of the SCO in 2017, both India and Pakistan have participated in multiple meetings of SCO and the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) despite hostilities and tension in Kashmir. The Heads of Government Council meeting is attended by the Prime Minister-level leaders of the member states that deliberate on the regional body’s economic and other pressing issues. The meeting also firms up SCO’s annual budget.

Prime Minister Khan who assumed office in 2018 has been a tough critic of India’s continued lockdown of Kashmir. He has also taken up the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 and the National Register of Citizens both domestically and on global platforms.

Though his predecessor Nawaz Sharif had visited India in May 2014 for the “mini-SAARC summit”, Mr. Khan has not been invited to India till now. On Thursday, the Pakistani leader welcomed the discussion on Kashmir held at the UN Security Council in New York, saying that the meeting “reflects a recognition of the seriousness of the prevailing situation (in Kashmir).”

Wednesday’s meeting on Kashmir was the second such China-backed meeting on “The India-Pakistan Question” at the UNSC since India ended the special status of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, 2019.

Reflecting on the discussion of Kashmir at the UNSC, Mr. Kumar said it is a “bilateral matter” and Pakistan “through a member of the UNSC” is misusing the high table of UN-level diplomacy. He argued that there is an international consensus favouring India’s position on Kashmir.

“The overwhelming majority of the UNSC members were of the view that UNSC was not the right forum for such issues...the informal closed-door meeting, therefore, concluded without any outcome. We sincerely hope that the message has gone across loud and clear to Pakistan that if at all there is any matter between India and Pakistan that needs to be discussed, it should be discussed bilaterally,” said Mr. Kumar.

He urged China to take note of support for India’s position and said, Beijing should “draw the proper lessons and refrain from taking such action in future.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/krhrww/article30363123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THIMRANKHAN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-to-invite-imran-khan-for-scos-annual-heads-of-government-meeting/article30577761.ece

“I have been told that more than 75% of K9 Vajra has been manufactured in India. Over 5,000 people have got direct employment and more than 12,500 indirect employment through this complex,” Mr. Singh said, terming the K9 Vajra-T gun the best example of ‘Make in India’ in defence.

In April 2017, L&T and Hanwa Techwin of South Korea signed a contract to manufacture 100 K9 Vajra-T guns. The K9 was shortlisted by the Army after extensive trials and the deal is worth about ₹4,500 crore for 100 guns. The Army inducted the first batch of three guns in end 2018 and al deliveries are set to be completed by year end.

“We wish to create an ecosystem that provides a platform to both public sector and private sector to work together and contribute to nation building through their strengths and experiences,” Mr. Singh said.

K9 Vajra-T is a 155-mm, 52-calibre self-propelled artillery gun with a maximum range of 40 km, customised from the original K9 Thunder gun. The fire control system has been customised for desert conditions to the requirements of the Army.

58,2020/01/16,"45 Madhya Pradesh labourers thrashed for refusing to be underpaid, return home","Forty-five labourers from the Mandla district, including women, sold to a contractor for ₹4.5 lakh in Maharashtra, where, upon refusing to be paid less than the agreed wage, they were confined, beaten up and threatened to fear for their lives, have returned home with the police’s aid.

“We are investigating the matter and the police have registered a complaint,” said District Collector Jagdish Chandra Jatiya. “Prime facie, it doesn’t appear to be a case of bonded labour, as they were taken from one place to another for work, and not bound to one place.”

No complaint filed

However, R. R. S. Parihar, District Superintendent of Police, claimed the group, for unknown reasons, had not filed a complaint with the police, and no case had been registered so far. “They came back on a train. We asked them to file a complaint with the Government Railway Police when they alleged they were being threatened, but they didn’t. They didn’t even approach us after returning.”

The labourers, residents of the Surehali village in the district, were promised ₹400-₹500 a day for sugarcane harvest in Kolhapur district in Maharashtra by a contractor, said Neeraj Markam, Zilla Panchayat member.

“On reaching there, they were sold to another contractor and told to work on per tonne basis instead. They felt betrayed, as this meant not more than ₹50 [as wages] a day. Still, they worked for one-and-a-half months,” he said.

Their 12 mobile phones, cash and ATM cards were snatched away, he said. “One time, a few of them even escaped into the forest, but were caught within a 45 km radius and brought back, and made to work.”

Police informed

One of them, who managed to keep a mobile phone, called his family, who informed the police in Mandla district. On being questioned, the second contractor told the Kolhapur Police he had paid ₹17 lakh in total to buy such groups from the agent from Mandla, including ₹4.5 lakh for this group, claimed Mr. Markam.

“Four of us were beaten up with sticks when we were caught attempting to escape,” said Golu Maravi, one of the labourers. “They said they had bought us, had a right over us, and if we acted smart, they would cut our limbs and make us beg on the streets.”

“To let them free, the contractor in Maharashtra asked for ₹20,000 as ‘recovery amount’ from their living expenses. If the original agreement was complied with, they would have made lakhs in total. But they didn’t even have enough to buy food, so women had to sell jewellery to pay the amount,” said Mr. Markam.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/45-madhya-pradesh-labourers-thrashed-for-refusing-to-be-underpaid-return-home/article30577707.ece
59,2020/01/16,India and U.S. in ‘advance stage’ of talks to resolve trade issues: Piyush Goyal,"Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said India and the U.S. are in an “advance stage” of dialogue to resolve some of the pressing trade issues. He said that both the countries can expand their trade relations which in future may result in a preferential or a free trade agreement.

“With the U.S., we are in an advance stage of dialogue to sort out some of the pressing issues,” he said.

The remarks assume significance as both the countries are negotiating a trade package to boost two-way commerce.

The Minister said that both the nations are big trading partners and can further expand trade.

“...I would believe that going forward both countries will like to further expand that engagement which could lead to PTA [preferential trade agreement] and FTA [free trade agreement] in the years ahead,” he added.

Talking about the stalled negotiations on the proposed free trade pact between India and the European Union, Mr. Goyal said Germany and France are keen that both the regions should enter into a trade pact.

“...at least begin with a PTA and move towards an FTA. I am looking forward for my engagement with EU trade commission,” he said.

“We are very keen to pursue the dialogue further. Earlier the dialogue was stalled largely on wines, spirits and automobiles. I think those are not as contentious issues today,” he said.

However, he added, issues on agriculture and non tariff barriers will find centre-stage in any new negotiations.

A proposed free-trade pact has been stalled since May 2013 between India and the EU as both sides failed to iron out differences of several issues.

The EU is seeking significant cut in import duties on wines, spirits and automobiles.

The Commerce Minister also said that India has “clearly” faced discrimination and lot of unfair trade practices from different countries around the world and now the country is in the process of bringing them out in right perspective and placing them before its trading partners.

About India’s decision to withdraw from Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) bloc, he said China was one of the 16 members of this grouping and “we have a very serious concerns about the way they are carrying out their trade and about the ways Chinese ecosystem is locked down for fair trade practices with other countries.”

Between 2003-04 and 2013-14, he said India’s trade deficit with the RCEP countries grew ten times from barely USD 7 billion to about USD 65-70 billion and today it is about USD 105 billion.

“We were not able to get fair access for our products and services in these countries,” he said adding services, a very important area for India, were not getting sufficient place in the agreement.

Against this backdrop, he said: “I and my government realise that it would be only detrimental to the domestic industry to get into the RCEP unless we get credible fair and accountable resolution of concerns.”

He added that other countries were not in a position in a short time frame to resolve those issues and “it would have been a good diplomatic move but certainly bad trade decision to be part of RCEP and I think trade will have to stand on its own legs and can not be dictated purely by diplomatic concerns”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kuhhyi/article30371824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Piyush-Goyal-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-and-us-in-advance-stage-of-talks-to-resolve-trade-issues-piyush-goyal/article30577694.ece

61,2020/01/16,"Lawyers appearing in SC should have minimum experience, says CJI","Chief Justice of India S A Bobde mooted an idea before the Bar on Thursday that there should be a minimum experience criteria for lawyers to appear before the Supreme Court.

A Bench comprising the CJI and justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant expressed its view on fixing some experience criteria for lawyers to appear before the top court when senior advocate and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Dushyant Dave raised the issue of difficulties being faced by advocates in getting the matters listed for urgent hearing.

“My lords, the Bar is facing problems in getting the matters listed for urgent hearing before the mentioning officer,” Mr. Dave told the Bench.

He said that at times lawyers are unable to persuade the mentioning officer about the “grave urgencies” of the matters which needed urgent hearing.

The CJI, who has been consistently saying that the mentioning of cases for urgent hearing should be done before the mentioning officer and not before the first court, today said, “We do not want to start the day like this. The idea of urgency in the mind of Bar is different.”

“We know that we have the power to restore the status quo ante (power to nullify the impact of orders of the court below) if required,” the Bench said, adding that a woman lawyer has been seeking an urgent hearing now of a petition which was filed in 2017.

Giving the illustration, the CJI said he has been telling the bar councils to fix minimum experience criteria for young lawyers for appearing in the Supreme Court.

62,2020/01/16,Mahatma Gandhi’s grandson slams digitisation of photos at Gandhi Smriti,"Legendary photographer Henri Cartier Bresson’s gallery of photographs of Mahatma Gandhi’s last moments at Gandhi Smriti has been digitised and displayed on LED screens in a loop without any text, and his grandson Tushar Gandhi is furious.

While Tushar Gandhi alleged an attempt to obliterate historical evidence, likening it to removing Renaissance paintings at the Louvre and replacing them digitally, Gandhi Smriti director Dipankar Shri Gyan denies the charge and says the display is still under construction.

Renowned French photographer Bresson was the last to have taken photographs of Mahatma Gandhi, just an hour before he was shot dead. The iconic photographer also documented the Mahatma’s death and its immediate aftermath.

Birla House where he took his last breath on the evening of January 30, 1948, is today Gandhi Smriti, a museum dedicated to the father of the nation.

Tushar Gandhi told PTI that the digital format running on LED TV screens at Gandhi Smriti only displays the photographs in a loop, completely ignoring its historical context written in text when the prints were displayed.

“The photographs are running on LED screens like a slideshow with no text. There was no reason why such beautiful prints of Bresson were removed. It’s like removing the paintings of the Rennaissance painters from the Louvre and replacing them digitally. There is no text to explain the situation and people don’t get to know anything from them. There are eyewitnesses accounts of journalists which people used to read. When it comes on the screen without any text, it is just like any other photograph,” he said.

Gandhi Smriti Director Gyan said the prints were digitally displayed when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the institution in November last year with German Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel.

“During that visit it was digitised for two-three days and again it was done when the PM visited with his Portuguese counterpart (Antonio Costa). The PM had recommended that everything be digitised and we received the orders from the secretary of the Ministry of Culture,” Mr. Gyan said.

The LED display of Bresson’s photographs opened for the regular public only four days ago, he said.

“It is still being worked on and we will incorporate everything in it. We opened it under pressure from the public who wanted to see the display. It is still under construction,” he added.

Tushar Gandhi also said the photographs on display were prints of the originals gifted by Bresson himself to Gandhi Smriti and thus had artistic value.

“Shocked. The evocative photo gallery of Henri Cartier Bresson displaying the post murder photographs from the Gandhi Smriti have been removed from display on the orders of The Pradhan Sevak. Bapu’s Murderers are obliterating Historic evidence. He Ram!” he said on Twitter.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3n6s6l/article30577543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/gandhijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mahatma-gandhis-grandson-decries-digitisation-of-photos-at-gandhi-smriti/article30577538.ece

Those transferred are CBI deputy superintendent of police Ranjit Kumar, who was probing the Narada tapes scandal, DSP Tathagata Bardhan, involved in the Saradha ponzi scam probe and DSP Chojom Sherpa investigating the Rose Valley chit fund scam, a CBI spokesman said.

The fourth officer is Inspector Bratin Ghoshal, a former investigation officer probing the Rose Valley chit fund scam, sources said.

While Mr. Kumar and Mr. Bardhan were transferred to New Delhi, Mr. Sherpa was posted to Bhubaneshwar.

“This is a routine transfer and a part of the transfer policy,” a CBI spokesman said.

However, one of the transferred officers told PTI, “This is a mass transfer. I do not know whether this is routine or not“.

The central agency started the probe into the Saradha chit fund case in May, 2014, and the Rose Valley ponzi scam case at around the same time.

The investigation into the Narada sting, which showed persons resembling senior Trinamool Congress leaders and a police officer accepting money from representatives of a fictitious company in return for favours, began in March, 2017.

Earlier this month, the central investigating agency shifted Deputy Inspector General Abhay Singh to the Economic Offences Wing in Delhi from the Special Crime Branch in Kolkata.

There was no discussion on uniform code for pharmaceutical marketing practices in the meeting,” said a statement issued by the industry body Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA).

The statement comes immediately after the country’s largest doctors’ body, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should “deny or prove or apologise for his statement that doctors are being bribed by pharmaceutical companies”.

Details sought

Doctors sought to know details of this meeting and said that “if the Government had details of the companies involved in supplying women to doctors, why did it choose to invite them for a meeting in the PMO (Prime Minister’s Office) rather than initiate criminal proceedings?”

The Association also accused the government of trying to divert attention from unresolved issues regarding the health of the people and of medical education in the country. “Ayushman Bharat, the flagship of the current Government, is a non-starter and operates more in government hospitals, where treatment is already free. Of the money paid to hospitals, including government hospitals, 15% is siphoned off by insurance companies, and the allotment for health by the government has hovered around 1% to 1.3% of GDP for the past few years,’’ the IMA said.

The IPA on the other hand said that “the focus of the discussion was to promote research and development, build innovation ecosystem, improve access to high-quality medicine and strengthen global competitiveness of the industry.”

‘To next level’

“The purpose was to take the industry to the next level and leverage opportunities, going forward in the pharmaceutical sector, besides discussing growth opportunities in the medical technology and hospital sectors. There was no discussion on a uniform code for pharmaceutical marketing practices in the meeting,” the IPA said.

The meeting was attended by leading industry figures such as Satish Reddy of Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Ajay Piramal of the Piramal Group, Pankaj Patel of Cadila Healthcare, Dilip Shanghvi of Sun Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Habil Khorakiwala from Wockhardt Limited, and Shobana Kamineni from the Apollo Hospitals Group, the IPA statement said.

The statements by both the bodies — the IPA and the IMA — comes after reports that the Prime Minister had allegedly warned India’s top pharmaceutical companies to strictly adhere to marketing ethics, and to “not bribe doctors with women, foreign trips and gadgets”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-discussion-on-uniform-code-for-pharma-marketing-practices-in-meeting-with-pm-says-ipa/article30577352.ece
66,2020/01/16,No relief for telcos; to pay ₹1.47 lakh-cr.,"A three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court led by Justice Arun Mishra, on Thursday, dismissed petitions filed by telecom companies, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, for a review of its October 2019 judgment upholding the recovery of past dues amounting to ₹1.47 lakh crore from them. The recovery by the government was based on adjusted gross revenue of about ₹92,000 crore.

The review petitions were rejected by the Bench, also comprising Justices Abdul S. Nazeer and M.R. Shah, in their chambers.

The Bench found no merit in the review petitions and rejected a plea for an open court hearing.

""Applications for hearing in open Court/oral hearing are rejected. Having perused the Review Petitions and the connected papers with meticulous care, we do not find any justifiable reason to entertain the review petitions. The Review Petitions are, accordingly, dismissed. Pending application(s), if any, shall stand disposed of,"" the Supreme Court observed in a short order.

On October 24 last year, the Supreme Court dealt a huge blow to telecom service providers when it upheld the Department of Telecom's (DoT) move to recover adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of about ₹92,000 crore from them.

The Bench had said the telecom sector had long reaped the fruits of the Centre’s liberalised mode of payment by revenue sharing regime. “The sector has benefited immensely under the scheme, as is apparent from the gross revenue trend from 2004 to 2015,” Justice Mishra had written, adding the service providers, in turn, failed to fulfil their obligations to the government and instead raised frivolous objections.

“The telecom service providers, in spite of the financial benefits of the package, started to ensure that they do not pay the licence fee to the public exchequer based on an agreed AGR,” the Supreme Court had observed in a 153-page judgment. The court had dismissed the telecom service providers’ objection to the government's formulation of AGR.

The judgment had said the gross revenue would be inclusive of installation charges, late fees, sale proceeds of handsets (or any other terminal equipment etc.), revenue on account of interest, dividend, value-added services, supplementary services, access or interconnection charges, roaming charges, revenue from permissible sharing of infrastructure and any other miscellaneous revenue, without any set-off for related item of expense.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ud7mmc/article30580462.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-telcosjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-rejects-telecom-companies-plea/article30577068.ece
67,2020/01/16,Amarinder Singh seeks a day’s time for resolution on CAA,"Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday did not rule out the possibility of bringing a resolution against the amended citizenship law during the ongoing two-day Assembly session.

“Wait till tomorrow,” Mr. Singh said when asked by reporters if the government will bring in a resolution, on the lines of Kerala, against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Punjab’s Congress government had on Tuesday said it will proceed according to the will of the House on the issue of CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Mr. Singh had recently said his government would not allow the implementation of the “brazenly divisive CAA“.

After a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, his colleagues in the ministry had expressed concern over the implications of the “blatantly unconstitutional and divisive CAA, NRC and NPR.”

They had also expressed alarm on the violence over the issue, which they said “threatened to rip apart the secular fabric of the nation“.

“The ministers were of the view that the matter was bound to be raised during the two-day session of the Assembly on January 16-17 and it was unanimously decided that the government should accept the will of the House,” an official statement had said then.

The Chief Minister has earlier said the CAA, particularly when coupled with the NRC and NPR, “violated” the Preamble to the Constitution.

Amarinder Singh had said neither he nor the Congress were against granting citizenship to the minorities persecuted on the basis of religion but they were completely opposed to the “discrimination in the CAA against certain religious communities, including Muslims“.

The CAA makes it easier for Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis to get citizenship if they have entered India before 2015, following religious persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

The students alleged that some 12 persons from outside assaulted them with “rods, pipes and sharp objects” near Bidya Bhavan Hostel. Two former students had been arrested for the attack.

Swapnaneel Mukherjee, who is in hospital with deep bruises, said the attack was a fallout of the students’ protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.

“While beating ... they made it clear that we are punished for organising the protest,” said Mr. Mukherjee, who is associated with a left-leaning student association. The protests were organised under a new students’ front, Visva-Bharati Students’ Unity.

It gheraoed BJP MP Swapan Dasgupta last week when he came to speak for the CAA at the Central university administered by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development. The incident irked rightist outfits and attacks were mounted on the students at the forefront of the protest over the last week.

Achintya Bagdi, one of the two arrested, enrolled himself in various streams between 2013 and 2019 — from ancient history and anthropology to philosophy — but could not clear the final examination.

Sabir Ali, the other person, left the university in 2016 and thus “they are not connected to the university”, a note from the assaulted students said. The students named one Sudipta Garai for the attack and said there was “absolutely no security inside the campus”.

The university administration said Visva-Bharati was not involved in the incident in any way. ""There is no political colour to it”, public relations officer (PRO) of the university Anirban Sircar told The Hindu.

He said the moment the administration learnt about the incident, officials reached the spot and controlled the situation. Asked whether the university was taking any steps against students involved in the violence, the PRO said, “They are looking into the matter.” The students alleged that the attackers were formerly associated with the Trinamool Congress while they “either work for the BJP or the ABVP now”.

The students held Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakravarty “directly responsible” for the attack. “The attackers escorted the Vice-Chancellor’s vehicle in bikes and moved towards the campus on Wednesday afternoon. It indicates that he facilitated their entry,” a student said on condition of anonymity. The Vice-Chancellor was called several times but his phone went unanswered.

Higher Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said the ABVP was involved in the violence. He said it had been carrying out attacks in institutes in the country to suppress democratic protests. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh expressed surprise at the allegation. He said the AVBP does not have the support to carry out such attacks. “I don’t know if AVBP has such support base to carry out attack in Visva Bharati. It is the goons of Trinamool Congress who have been involved in the violence. I think the police should take action.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/students-attacked-at-viswa-bharati-campus/article30576737.ece
70,2020/01/16,"‘Tests needed to ascertain structural safety of Parliament, North, South Blocks’","Structural engineers consulted for the Centre’s redevelopment of Central Vista have said invasive tests would need to be done to find out whether Parliament House and North and South Blocks are structurally sound or not, sources involved with the project said.

As a part of the revamp project, a new Parliament building would be constructed, while offices of various ministries would be moved out of North and South Block, which would be turned into museums, according to the plan drafted by Gujarat-based HCP Design, Planning and Management. The firm was selected by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) for drafting the masterplan for the 3-km-long Rajpath in October last year.

Among the reasons that a new Parliament and office buildings were needed, according to the CPWD as well as Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry officials, was the structural safety of the heritage structures that were built from 1911 till 1931.

‘Invasive testing’

A source involved in the project said that structural engineers had been consulted over the safety of the existing Parliament and North and South Blocks. “They said we need to conduct tests to really know the status. But Parliament seems to be the most under stress due to the high density of movement in the building,” the source said, adding that some of these tests would be “invasive”.

In the request for proposal floated by the CPWD in September, which led to the appointment of HCP, the agency had said: “Buildings constructed over 100 years ago such as North and South Block are not earthquake safe.”

‘Made earthquake-safe’

Sources in the Ministry say the buildings would have to be retro-fitted and made earthquake-safe, but there has been no decision on it so far. While HCP has proposed converting the Parliament and North and South Block buildings into museums, the plan is yet to finalised, sources in the Ministry said. No decision had been taken regarding Rashtrapati Bhavan, which is not a part of the revamp project, though the building dates back to the same period as the other structures along the Central Vista, a source said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vx0649/article30579362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THLTOFFBEATCLOUDSATCENTRALVISTAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tests-needed-to-ascertain-structural-safety-of-parliament-north-south-blocks/article30576628.ece
71,2020/01/16,PM’s office and house to be at walking distance,"A new residence and office for the Prime Minister, at walking distance from each other, 10 new office buildings that will be built in place of existing structures, including the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA), and the ‘New India Gardens near the Yamuna’ are a part of the Narendra Modi government’s redevelopment plan for Rajpath.

The Centre’s ambitious plan to revamp the 3-km-long Central Vista from Rashtrapati Bhavan till India Gate is being designed by Ahmedabad-based firm HCP Design, Planning and Management.

In the current version of the plan, which is yet to be finalised, HCP’s director Bimal Patel said a 15-acre plot at Jamnagar House, where hutments stand today, had been identified to for the relocated IGNCA. Whether or not the national centre for arts that comes up at the site will bear the former Prime Minister’s name remains to be seen.

Triangular building

As a part of the plan, being executed through the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, a new Parliament building near the existing circular heritage structure has been proposed. Mr. Patel said the triangular building will have a Lok Sabha chamber big enough to accommodate 900 MPs usually, in view of any future increase in the number of seats, and up to about 1,300 for a joint session of Parliament. Two MPs would share one 1,300 mm bench, which would be enough to accommodate a third MP during a joint session, he said.

The triangular building would have a spire, though the material it would be made of was yet to be decided. Speaking of the original architects of New Delhi, Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, Mr. Patel said the idea wasn’t to mimic the existing Parliament, but have the new and old buildings work together.

New PMO

The Prime Minister’s residence was proposed to be shifted to a plot south of South Block, while the new PMO (Prime Minister’s Office) would be opposite the DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) Bhawan, giving the PM the option of walking to work and back, he said. The North and South Block, may be converted into museums of Indian history, while the Ministries located there currently would be shifted to the ten office buildings along Central Vista, according to the current plan. The Vice President’s residence would be shifted to a plot near North Block that currently has hutments.

The ten new buildings will be seven-storied, with stone on the outer façade, and glass and steel facing the inner courtyards. These would be connected to the Metro stations in the area through underground shuttles, he said. These buildings would bring all Central government Ministries in one area.

The original National Archives building would remain the same, but the additions to the plot over the years would be removed, he said. A central conference facility would be constructed next to the archives.

Commemoration

The Central Vista Avenue will be spruced up, with better landscaping and public facilities. Taking forward Lutyens’ idea of “ridge to river”, a “New India Gardens” would be created near the Yamuna. A design competition would be held for the installation to commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence at these gardens.

Lastly, a 48-acre space along the Mother Teresa Crescent would be used to house a biodiversity arboretum, where endangered plant species would be preserved in glass houses.

According to sources, this plan has been evolving since October, when HCP was awarded the contract by the CPWD. Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep S. Puri has said earlier that the tenders for the individual projects within the larger revamp would be floated by May. The deadlines for the new Parliament and common Central Secretariat are 2022 and 2024 respectively.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pms-office-and-house-to-be-at-walking-distance/article30576603.ece
72,2020/01/16,"Govt. has money for statues, not public health: Bombay High Court","The Bombay High Court on Thursday came down heavily on the Maharashtra government for dragging its feet over financial aid to Wadia Hospitals for women and children, and said the government has money for statues but not for public health.

A division bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I.Chagla was hearing a public interest litigation seeking release of grants to Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children and Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the State government.

The maternity hospital receives grant from the State government and the children’s hospital gets it from the BMC.

Government counsel Girish Godbole told the court that the State finance department has sanctioned ₹24 crore from the contingency fund.

“The amount will be released lump sum to the Wadia Maternity Hospital within three weeks,” he said.

The bench, however, said it was unimpressed with this and that the amount should be released by Friday.

“The government wants to build Babasaheb Ambedkar’s statue taller than the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue. For all this money is there, but those people whom Ambedkar represented all his life can die?” Justice Dharmadhikari asked.

“Do people require medical aid or statues to rid themselves of ailments and diseases?” the court asked.

Public health has never been a priority for the government, the bench said, adding that the “Chief Minister is busy inaugurating bridges“.

“We thought there are new faces at the political helm, then all these matters won’t come to court. This does not auger well,” the court said.

The court also said that in a city like Mumbai, which is considered as the country’s commercial capital, people from the poorer section of society are refused admission to a charitable hospital.

“This is disgusting. How can people, mainly women and children, be refused admission to a hospital? Children are dying and the State machinery is not doing anything in States like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat...”

“Should we have the same situation in Maharashtra?” Justice Dharmadhikari said.

The court said due to lack of funds, hospitals are finding it difficult to cater to the needs of patients.

“These patients cannot afford private hospitals as they are mainly from the poor section of society. They require urgent medical attention. In such circumstances, the State government is obliging nobody by making statements that funds have been sanctioned,” the court said.

The BMC informed the bench that it will release ₹14 crore for Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children.

The court posted the matter for further hearing on Friday, when the government will have to state by when the funds sanctioned will be released.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9uwsjo/article30576582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THBOMBAYHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-has-money-for-statues-not-public-health-bombay-high-court/article30576583.ece
73,2020/01/16,IAF rescues 107 trekkers on Chadar trek in Ladakh,"Advanced Light helicopters (ALH) of the Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopters carried out a search and rescue operation at Niraq in the Zanskar valley and rescued 107 trekkers over the last two days, the IAF said on Thursday.

“Fifty trekkers got stranded when some portions of the frozen Zanskar river melted. The melting caused the flow of the water to become too strong for the trekkers to continue across the river on foot,” the IAF said in a statement. The stranded trekkers managed to move to Niraq, a small campsite upstream from where they were rescued, IAF added.

The rescued trekkers include one male and one female from France and four male and three females from China, IAF said.

Army, too

Two days ago, the Army’s 14 Corps, too, launched multiple search columns to rescue a group of tourists stranded in bad weather while undertaking the ‘Chaddar trek’.

“Responding swiftly to a request received from the UT (Union Territory) administration, columns were launched from two directions to reach tourists who were stuck at the Niraq village. Helicopters of the Army Aviation were also pressed into service for the purpose,” the Army had stated.

Despite the narrow valleys along the Zanskar River, Army Aviation helicopters managed to land in inclement weather at a makeshift helipad in Niraq. A column of Army personnel was inducted to coordinate the rescue operations, the Army had stated. An Army Medical Officer was present to provide immediate medical aid to tourists, while medicines, emergency rations and warm clothing were taken by helicopters.

The Army evacuated six seriously ill tourists suffering from the effects of frostbite and High Altitude Pulmonary Oedema (HAPO) to its medical facility in Leh.

74,2020/01/16,IUML asks Supreme Court to stay implementation of CAA before it’s too late,"The exercise of granting citizenship to illegal migrants on the basis of their religion has already started under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) of 2019. The Supreme Court has to intervene and immediately stay the implementation of the Act before it is too late, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) party urged the court on Thursday.

Just three days after the government notified the implementation of the CAA on January 10, the Uttar Pradesh government promptly sent a list of 40,000 illegal migrants for grant of citizenship.

“It would be in the interest of justice to stay the operation of the Amendment Act. It has come into force. State of Uttar Pradesh’s prompt action to collect the data of non-Muslim illegal migrants shows that exercise of granting citizenship under the CAA is already under way,” said the application filed by advocates Haris Beeran and Pallavi Pratap.

Letting the CAA continue in operation till the Supreme Court delivered a final judgment would render the cause ‘fait accompli’ as citizenship once granted could not be withdrawn, the application contended.

The IUML, which forms part of the United Democratic Front in Kerala, was the first off the block among Opposition political parties to challenge the CAA after it was passed by the Rajya Sabha, saying the law violated the basic and fundamental value of the Indian Constitution that “all should be treated equally alike” and should be struck down as unconstitutional.

The applications have been filed shortly after Kerala’s Left Democratic Front government led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan filed an original suit in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the CAA. The State has seen political parties on opposite sides of the spectrum come together to resist the CAA.

The CAA ostensibly bestows the benefit of Indian citizenship by naturalisation to illegal immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh to persons who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, except Muslims.

‘Conflicting statements’

In a separate application, the IUML said conflicting statements made within the government, including those of the Prime Minister and Home Minister, had bred confusion on the conduct of the nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The application said the government should come clear on whether pan-India NRC would be implemented or not. The government should clarify whether the National Population Register (NPR) was linked to the NRC. If the government was going ahead with the exercise, the UML said, the Supreme Court should stay both the NPR and the NRC exercises. The Kerala government had already stalled the preparation of the NPR in the State, suspecting that its data might be used for the NRC.

The application drew the court’s attention to the NRC’s “unconstitutional, unlawful and inhumane effects” in Assam. The Assam NRC, significantly, was monitored by the Supreme Court.

The application said Section 14A of the Citizenship Act was added in 2004. The particular provision did not mandate an NRC to be conducted nationwide. The Section only sought identification of citizens in the border States where the problem of illegal migrants occurred. The rest of the country did not face any such problems, the IUML said.

Further, Section 14A(2) of the Act specifies that conduct of the NRC was not compulsory.

The Supreme Court has scheduled the hearing of over 60 writ petitions challenging the CAA on January 22.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4298nv/article30537200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/stay-implementation-of-caa-before-its-too-late-iuml-says-in-supreme-court/article30575301.ece

“We are the best of friends with India,” Mr. Karzai said adding, “but how do we convey to Pakistan that we can be the best of brothers at the same time.”

Speaking at the ongoing Raisina Dialogue jointly organised by the Ministry of External Affairs and Observer Research Foundation, he said there was no other way for Afghanistan, “we need the peace process to be successful.”

Asked about the troubled relationship with Pakistan, Mr. Karzai said there were two sides to it. “Pakistani people received us as refugees with open arms, we’re grateful for that. On the other hand, we have serious complaints with the Pak. government and military on the issue of terrorism,” he stated adding they too in Afghanistan perhaps made some mistakes in managing the relationship.

“If during the investigation, anything regarding the (Parliamant) attack is established, it will be looked into too. His previous activities will be probed,” DGP Singh said in a press conference in Jammu on Wednesday.

Mr. Davinder Singh was part of the special anti-militancy squad Special Operations Group in 2002 and was named by Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, in a letter to his lawyer, and suggested that another attacker Mohammad was taken to Delhi on the directions of the police officer.

On the suspicion of involvement of any other police official in supporting militants groups, the DGP said, “no one will be spared.”

The ICJ described the CAA as a “discriminatory” law.

At least 19 persons died in UP, most of them through bullet injuries, during the protests against the CAA last month.

“The high death toll of peaceful protestors in Uttar Pradesh highlights the use of excessive force by the police, in contravention of international standards of policing and human rights,” Sam Zarifi, ICJ Secretary General said in a statement.

The governments must investigate any death or injury that occurs during protests by law enforcement officials and to ensure access to justice to victims and their families, Mr. Zarifi added. The ICJ issued a briefing paper on the police action on demonstrators.

The paper was based on firsthand interviews with witnesses and victims and documents the “unnecessary, excessive and indiscriminate” use of force in UP, including the use of firearms as well as teargas, water cannons, and baton charging by the police in response the ongoing protests.

While police authorities claim that the protestors initiated the violence, firsthand interviews with victims and witnesses and numerous other credible reports indicate that the police used force on peaceful protestors including lathis, teargas, bullets, the ICJ said.

Mr. Raut, whose party is a part of the ruling alliance with the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in Maharashtra, claimed that Indira Gandhi met Karim Lala in Mumbai.

Karim Lala was one of the three top underworld dons of Mumbai for over two decades, from the sixties to the early eighties and the other two being Mastan Mirza alias Haji Mastan and Varadarajan Mudaliar.

“Indira ji was a true patriot who never compromised on India’s national security,” Mr. Deora said in a tweet.

Mr. Deora also said that politicians should refrain from distorting legacies of deceased Prime Ministers.

Former Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam said that Mr. Raut will repent if he continues a false campaign against Ms. Gandhi.

Noting that Mr. Raut often shares poetry of others, Mr. Nirupam said that it will be better if the Shiv Sena leader focuses on entertaining Maharashtra with such poetic stuff.

“He should withdraw the statement he gave about Indiraji yesterday,” Mr. Nirupam tweeted.

During an interview to the Lokmat media group at its award function in Pune, Mr. Raut claimed, “When (underworld don) Haji Mastan came to Mantralaya, the entire secretariat would come down to see him.

A Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde, following an urgent mention by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, froze the operation of the January 15 order of the High Court.

Mr. Mehta said the import of the ‘unusual’ order allowing the duo to go home was the same as granting them bail.

The direction to allow the Wadhawans to go home with two guards was part of the HC order appointing a committee led by Justice S. Radhakrishnan for the speedy disposal of the assets. The court reasoned that the duo would be able to better help the cause of disposal of their assets by being available at home rather than in the jail.

The High Court had even barred lower courts from entertaining the bail applications of the duo until the next hearing.

It directed that the Wadhawans would remain at home under the constant watch of the guards. They would travel with the guards “for ensuring compliance of the directions of the committee and for assisting in the process of sale”. It had barred the duo from leaving the State.

According to a communication from the PMC Bank to the Joint Commissioner of Police, Economic Offences Wing, Mumbai, the dues of the companies owned directly and indirectly by the two accused are about ₹4,635.62 crore.

The High Court is hearing a plea by a PMC investor to either sell or auction their assets to re-pay investors/depositors.

The accused have already disclosed the details of their companies’ properties. They have said on affidavit in the High Court that their sale would be sufficient to cover the dues.

Officials said while Mr. Fernandes has been summoned on January 20, few others have also been asked to depose for questioning in the following days.

The fresh summons have been issued to take the probe forward, officials said.

The ED probe is related to allegations that the airline tried to manipulate government policies through corrupt means to get international licence for its Indian venture Air Asia India Limited.

The ED case was registered after the CBI filed an FIR to probe these allegations.

The ED is also probing this case under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

Investigation in the case was initiated on the basis of the claims of ousted Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry’s allegation that fraudulent transactions of ₹22 crore, involving non-existent entities in India and Singapore, were carried out in an instance involving the airline.

In a series of tweets late on Wednesday, Mr. Singh lashed out at the former government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). He said, “The previous govt nearly framed me as #urbannaxal in #Bhimaakoreogao and #ElgarParishad which only proves that it was a managed case and good activist are still behind jail When will they get justice.”

In another tweet, he said, “Police officers called me up that they will help in this case and when I said prosecute me they never called me again.I m ready to tell this to any agency Maharashtra Govt should appoint a retired HighCourt judge to look into all managed cases.”

On the Pegasus spyware case, in which cell phones of activists were allegedly hacked into, Mr. Singh said, “Is the @OfficeofUT going to give details in public that who was behind snooping and tapping in #maharashtra Who were the officers of Maharashtra Govt who went to #Israel to talk to #NS0 the brain behind malware.”

Digvijaya Singh

On Thursday, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the MVA government has taken serious note of the allegations. Mr. Deshmukh said, “My department will be conducting an inquiry to check which officers had travelled to Israel and whether any technology was brought in here to snoop.”

Mr. Deshmukh said the allegations indicate that politicians not affiliated to the BJP were snooped upon during the Assembly elections. Only two agencies — State Intelligence Department and Anti Terrorism Squad — are authorised to tap telephonic conversations with the government’s permission, he said.

Similar concerns

Mr. Singh’s demand for a probe into the Pune Police’s actions in the case was also raised by Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar last month, soon after the formation of the MVA government. Mr. Pawar had termed the arrest of academics, lawyers and activists like Surendra Gadling, Sudha Bharadwaj and Shoma Sen “wrong” and “vengeful”. He said he would ask for a Special Investigation Team to look into the arrests.

In 2018, the Pune Police said Mr. Singh’s cell phone number had surfaced in one of the alleged Naxal communications seized during raids on June 6 on the homes of Mr. Gadling, Ms. Sen and three others.

The letter, dated September 25, 2017, allegedly written by comrade Prakash to a comrade Surendra (supposedly a reference to Mr. Gadling) talks about the need to “intensify nationwide protests using students [since] state forces will be soft against students which will gradually put the state at a disadvantage while acting against us”.

In this context, the letters states, “Congress leaders are very much willing to assist in this process and have also agreed fund further agitations whenever such opportunities arrive. In this regard you can contact our friend at [a mobile number allegedly belonging to Mr. Singh].”

At a press conference in Delhi following the raids, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra flayed the Congress for its “double-standards” on the Naxalism while stating that the “phone number belonged to Mr. Singh, party leader Rahul Gandhi’s mentor. Brandishing a letter allegedly seized by the police, Mr. Patra said, “Mr. Singh hasn’t clarified that it’s not his number and thus has accepted that it is his.”

In response, Mr. Singh dared the Narendra Modi-led Central government to arrest him if his Naxal links were proved. “First I was dubbed a ‘traitor’ and now I’m branded a ‘Naxalite’. If it is indeed so, then I must me arrested right here,” Mr. Singh had told reporters in Satna.

Police refutes claims

However, the police in November that year refuted reports suggesting that Mr. Singh could be questioned in connection with banned Maoist outfits and the Bhima-Koregaon clashes of January 1, 2018. Shivaji Pawar, the then Assistant Commissioner of Police and investigating officer in the case, had clarified that no move was being mooted on part of the police to question Mr. Singh in the case.

83,2020/01/16,Children being radicalised in Kashmir: Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat,"Children as young as 10-12 years are being radicalised in Kashmir and there is need to isolate those completely radicalised and put them in “deradicalisation camps,” Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen. Bipin Rawat said on Thursday. He also said that security forces cannot be blamed for injuries caused by pellet guns.

Speaking on a panel on countering terrorism at the ongoing Raisina Dialogue organised by the Ministry of External Affairs and Observer Research Foundation, Gen. Rawat said radicalisation can be countered by looking at where it is happening and who are behind it.

“What we saw in Kashmir, we saw radicalisation happening. Today we are seeing radicalisation being undertaken even amongst young people. Girls and boys as young as 10-12 are now being radicalised. These people can still be isolated from radicalisation in a gradual way, but there are people who have been completely radicalised. These people need to be taken out separately and possibly taken into some deradicalisaiton camps,” he said.

“We have deradicalisation camps going on in our country”, he added, in the first comments on such camps from the Army.

Gen. Rawat said radicalisation is happening in schools, universities, religious places and sites. “First we need to get to the nerve of who is radicalising people... You can start isolating these people gradually and then start a counter-radicalisation programme by identifying people who have been radicalised, to what degree. We have got to segregate them in degrees and then look at those who are completely radicalised, first target them, but also looking at the future,” he said.

He said even Pakistan has such camps and they understand that some of “the terrorism they have been supporting, it is now hitting them back.”

Gen. Rawat said security forces cannot be blamed for injuries caused due to pellet guns and the radicalised stone-pelters are “more dangerous.” “The pellet guns are non-lethal weapons which are now used very rarely and only aimed below the legs,” he said.

There is an impression being created that the Army is heavy-handed in Kashmir, he said to a question on Kashmir. “We had to be heavy-handed when terrorism was forced upon us in the 1990s”, he said, adding it wasn’t so later. Stating that the casualties of security forces with respect to terrorists was 1:3, he said, “If we were heavy-handed we wouldn’t have these casualties.”

'Sponsors of terrorism have to be taken to task'

He said “we can’t control terrorism” so long as there are states that “sponsor terrorism and they are going to use terrorists as proxies, make weapons available to them, provide funding for them.”

“We’ve to bring an end to terrorism and that can only happen the way Americans started after 9/11. They said let’s go on a global war on terror. To do that you have to isolate the terrorists. Anybody who is sponsoring terrorism has to be taken to task,” Gen. Rawat said, adding, “With Pakistan we are going for blacklisting under Financial Action Task Force (FATF). If not, then we have to go for decisive action.”

Taliban talks

Welcoming a peace deal with the Taliban in Afghanistan, Gen. Rawat said they should give up weapons.

“You have to come to a peace deal with everybody (in Afghanistan), if you've to come to a peace deal with them you’ve to go for negotiated peace. Taliban or whichever organisation is contemplating terror has to give up that weapon of terror, they must come to the political mainstrean,” he said. “It should not be a way to find an exit,” he added, referring to the planned U.S. exit from the country.

On how the CDS will work with the three Service Chiefs, Gen. Rawat said the CDS is the first among equals and has got clear and well-defined responsibilities. “While he is the first among equals, he has some authority over the three service chiefs except on operational issues,” he said, adding he had meetings with the three Chiefs and a “lot of decisions have already been taken in the past 15 days.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qjfm2l/article30573673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GENBIPINRAWAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/raisina-dialogue-states-sponsoring-terrorism-must-be-taken-to-task-chief-of-defence-staff-gen-bipin-rawat/article30573674.ece

Meanwhile, the university administration said nearly 5,400 students had registered for the winter semester. Wednesday was the last day for registration.

Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry officials spoke to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice Chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar on Wednesday to take stock of the situation in the university.

The JNUSU has been observing a registration boycott over the issue, while the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) is on a “non-cooperation” mode with the administration, which has led to a stalemate in the university.

The JNUSU will hold a meeting on Thursday to decide the future course of action as regards the movement against the hostel fee hike.

The JNUTA had a meeting with HRD ministry officials on Wednesday, where they reiterated their demand for the VC’s removal, citing “irregularities” in faculty recruitment and other issues.

The teachers’ association held a general body meeting on Wednesday, but could not arrive at a consensus. The meeting will continue on Friday.

According to JNUTA president DK Lobiyal, the previous semester has not been completed owing to the situation in the university and the administration is stressing on starting the new semester.

The proposed pension will be like the Swatantra Senani Samman Pension Scheme and is with the Defence Ministry, Gen. Naravane said at an event of the Armed Forces Veterans Day.

There has been a demand for pension to these officers as they retired much before completing pensionable service. There are about 2,000 such officers and the proposal has been with the Defence Ministry since March and some clarifications have been sought, defence sources said.

Gen. Naravane also said a proposal to grant 20% more vacancies for Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) to get honorary commission was also with the Ministry. Addressing the event, Navy Chief Adm.

88,2020/01/16,"IGNCA to be demolished, relocated as part of Central Vista revamp","The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA)is among the government buildings set to be demolished to make way for 10 new office buildings, according to the plan proposed by Ahmedabad-based firm HCP Design, Planning and Management, which is designing the master-plan for the new Central Vista.

In the current version of the plan, which is yet to be finalised, HCP director Bimal Patel said a 15-acre plot at Jamnagar House where hutments stand today had been identified to relocate IGNCA. Whether or not the national centre for arts that comes up at the site will bear the former Prime Minister’s name, remains to be seen.

As a part of the ambitious plan, being executed through the Central Public Works Department of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, a new Parliament building near the existing circular heritage structure has been proposed. Mr. Patel said the triangular building will have a Lok Sabha chamber big enough to accommodate 900 MPs usually, in view of any future increase in the number of seats, and up to about 1,300 for a joint session of Parliament. Two MPs would share one 1,300 mm bench, which would be enough to accommodate a third MP during a joint session, he said.

The triangular building would have a spire, though the material it would be made of was yet to be decided. Speaking of the original architects of New Delhi, Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker, Mr. Patel said the idea wasn’t to mimic the existing Parliament, but have the new and old buildings work together.

The Prime Minister’s residence was proposed to be shifted to a plot south of South Block, while the new PMO would be opposite DRDO Bhawan, giving the PM the option of walking to work and back, he said. The North and South Block, may be converted into museums of Indian history, while the Ministries located there currently, would be shifted to the 10 office buildings along Central Vista, according to the current plan. The Vice-President’s residence would be shifted to a plot near North Block that currently has hutments.

The 10 new buildings will be seven-storied, with stone on the outer façade, with glass and steel facing the inner courtyards. These would be connected to the Metro stations in the area through underground shuttles, he said. These buildings would bring all Central government Ministries in one area.

The original National Archives building would remain the same, but the additions to the plot over the years would be removed, he said.A central conference facility would be constructed next to the archives.

The Central Vista Avenue will be spruced up, with better landscaping and public facilities. Taking forward Lutyens’ idea of “ridge to river”, a “New India Gardens” would be created near the Yamuna. A design competition would be held for the installation to commemorate 75 years of India’s Independence at these gardens.

Lastly, a 48-acre space along Mother Teresa Crescent would be used to house a biodiversity arboretum, where endangered plant species would be preserved in glass houses.

According to sources, this plan has been evolving since October, when HCP was awarded the contract by CPWD. Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep S Puri has said earlier that the tenders for the individual projects within the larger revamp would be floated by May. The deadlines for the new Parliament and common Central Secretariat are 2022 and 2024 respectively.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q3kxj1/article30573195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DelhiMasterplanAerial-centerDM06b,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ignca-to-be-demolished-relocated-as-part-of-central-vista-revamp/article30573196.ece
89,2020/01/16,We are watching movements in the Indian Ocean Region: Navy Chief,"The Chinese Navy is expanding rapidly and there are increases forays in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), said Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh on Wednesday. Similar concerns were shared by Navy officers from Australia, France, Japan and U.K.

Presently, at any given time there are about 7-8 vessels and 85% of their defence exports are in the IOR, Adm. Singh said. They are watching developments in the region and have begun Mission Based Deployments, he added. “If anything impinges our sovereignty or national security, we will have to act,” he stated speaking at the Raisina Dialogue jointly organised by the Ministry of External Affairs and Observer Research Foundation.

Elaborating, Adm. Singh said there are instances where PLA ships had come into India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and added, “We had to tell them it impinges on our rights.”

In the last few years there has been an huge increase in the presence of PLA Navy’s deployment in the Indian Ocean. Beginning 2008, China has been sending ships and even nuclear submarines on anti-piracy patrols in the region. Apart from getting access to several ports and facilities in the Indian Ocean, China has recently opened its first overseas military base in Djibouti in the Horn of Africa giving it the ability to monitor across the Gulf of Aden and Persian Gulf.

On the concept of Indo-Pacific, Adm. Sigh said constructs like this are not directed against anyone. “The general end state that we wish to achieve is getting seas which are free for commerce and promote economic prosperity,” he stated. On the future of Quad and possible upgradation, he said is and there is a desire to evolve more “we are ready.”

“Quad will evolve organically as we have a common understanding of what we want.”

On Russia’s role in the Indo-Pacific, Adm. Tony Radakin, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, U.K said, “There are opportunities for us to work together in the maritime domain but within the rules based world order.”

Vice Adm. David Johnston, Vice Chief of the Defence Force of Australia too echoed a similar view by stating that “Quad is one of the mechanisms we have with like minded countries.”

Stating the French view, Gen. Luc de Rancourt, Deputy Director General for International Relations and Strategy, Ministry of Armed Forces acknowledged that they have seen China become more and more active while adding that they have an Indo-Pacific strategy which is not been designed against China. However, he added, the thing which is puzzling them was, a fait accompli China can accomplish in the South China Sea (SCS).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/j4m6av/article30565143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAVYKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/we-are-watching-movements-in-the-indian-ocean-region-navy-chief/article30573179.ece

99,2020/01/16,Keystrokes to Kuchipudi steps,"Who said classical dance is only for urban learners? The less privileged in the countryside too have the zeal to learn, and excel. But the absence of good trainers stymies their interest.

Breaking the stereotype and intending to reach out, Hyderabad-based Kuchipudi danseuse Jyothi Reddy is making serious efforts to take the ancient dance form to the other corner of Andhra Pradesh.

Passion calling

Hailing from a farmer’s family of Vajjavari Kandriga in Nagalapuram, the last mandal in Chittoor district on the Tamil Nadu border, Ms. Reddy settled down in Hyderabad after marriage. An MCA from Sri Padmavathi Mahila Viswa Vidyalayam (SPMVV) Tirupati, and M.S. from BITS Pilani, she worked in the software industry for 11 years, before realising her keen interest in Kuchipudi since her childhood.

“When I admitted my five-year-old daughter in a Kuchipudi class, I felt an inexplicable urge to enrol myself. So, we both joined the class together,” recalls Ms. Reddy with a wide grin, speaking to The Hindu. That classical dance is her calling became quite evident especially after her daughter Tharishya Reddy - a budding classical dancer - gave her maiden stage performance. When the time to make a choice came, Ms. Reddy decided to bade her software job - fetching her quite a decent sum - goodbye, as her passion for Kuchipudi overtook the aptitude for professional excellence. After six years of rigorous practice, Ms. Reddy decided to pass on the knowledge to fellow aspirants and set up a dance school in Hyderabad.

Bridging a dance gap

Finding that rural students are killing their dreams due to non-availability of qualified and trained teachers, she decided to take it to her motherland, in spite of her busy schedule at her Hyderabad school with 90 disciples. “My idea is not only to serve my native place, but also to bridge the gap between knowledge seekers and providers,” Ms. Reddy said.

So was born ‘Jyothi Kalakshetra School of Arts’. It functions from Sri Vignesh Vidya School premises in the dusty little town of Nagalapuram, which has nearly 100 villages within a radius of 10 km, where she plans to develop a cultural ecosystem. The classes were launched early this week and she is present here for three days in a month. Kuchipudi aspirants can call 96527 13936 for enrolment.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/keystrokes-to-kuchipudi/article30574680.ece

According to Penukonda Circle Inspector Sree Hari, the accused persons cut the CCTV wires before attempting to cut open the ATM machine cash chamber. Following this, an alarm went up in the bank monitoring headquarters, who in turn informed the police. When the police rushed to the spot, the gas cutting equipment with which they tried to open the machine was left behind, and the machine sustained extensive damage.

102,2020/01/16,Cabinet expansion only after Delhi Assembly polls?,"The much-delayed Cabinet expansion is now likely only in February after the completion of the Delhi Assembly polls, according to multiple sources in the BJP.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had recently said that he would visit New Delhi to consult with the high command and expand the Cabinet before his trip to Davos for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. However, the meeting did not come through and he is now expected to meet Home Minister Amit Shah on January 18, when he will visit Hubballi to attend a rally on CAA. But he will leave for Davos on January 19, which almost rules out expansion before his Davos trip, his close associates said.

“After Mr. Yediyurappa returns from Davos, there will be little time for the high command to clear the Cabinet expansion, as the Union Budget is scheduled for February 1 and the Delhi Assembly polls for February 8. The party high command will not be willing to open another front during this period,” a senior party strategist said.

While leaders close to the Chief Minister are upset over Mr. Shah not giving him an appointment for many months now, other leaders in the State unit blamed the CM himself for the delay. “Mr. Yediyurappa has not been not able to finalise a suitable combination for his Cabinet balancing regional, caste aspirations. He is under tremendous pressure from multiple interests, as was evident with the recent public demand for ministries to specific individuals by a Lingayat seer,” said a senior Minister in the government. Proposals to drop a few Ministers to accommodate new faces has also driven discord even within the Cabinet, sources said.

Meanwhile, Dinesh Gundu Rao, KPCC president who has now submitted his resignation, said the CM seemed to be under huge pressure. “The BJP high command is humiliating our CM by not giving him time and appointment. Is this the way to behave with the CM of a State?” he asked.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cabinet-expansion-only-after-delhi-assembly-polls/article30578947.ece
103,2020/01/16,Yediyurappa downplays comments by Lingayat seer,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday sought to downplay the recent comments by Panchamasali seer, demanding at least three ministerial berths to the community.

“There will be pressure from different communities on the government always. The comments by Vachananda Swami is a natural reaction and there need not be any further discussion on the issue,” Mr. Yediyurappa said.

Vachananda Swami, seer of the Panchamasali sect from Harihar, had on stage demanded that the community be given three ministries and specifically mentioned that Murugesh Nirani from the community be made a minister. He had said that if it was not done, the community would withdraw its support to Mr. Yediyurappa.

The comment had visibly upset the Chief Minister, who was also on the stage. and he threatened to walk out of the programme. “You can give suggestions but cannot threaten me,” he had said. Later, he also said that if people did not want him, he would resign.

However, Mr. Yediyurappa on Thursday brushed aside the episode. “As Chief Minister, I have the responsibility to take along all communities with me. Seers and sanyasis from all communities have only love and trust in me and such comments come only out of that trust. I believe in Basavanna’s saying that those who criticise us are the real well-wishers.

104,2020/01/16,Milk price hike to be discussed at KMF board meet today,"An increase in the input cost over the last couple of years could result in a hike in Nandini milk, marketed by the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF). While all the district milk unions have sought a hike, the KMF board is meeting on Friday to discuss the issue even as KMF chairman Balachandra Jarkiholi on Thursday indicated that the proposed hike could be in the range of ₹2 to ₹3 per litre.

The last hike was in 2017 when the federation raised the price by ₹2 and ₹1 per litre in south and north Karnataka respectively. Currently, a litre of milk costs in the range of ₹35 to ₹37 in the State. Prior to the April 2017 hike, the KMF had implemented a steep hike of ₹4 per litre in January 2016.

Indicating a possible hike, Mr. Jarkiholi told presspersons that there was a proposal before the KMF board to increase the price. “The hike has been sought to provide benefits to the farmers. The difference in the price of milk between KMF and private dairies is ₹10 per litre. After the board discussion, we will take the matter to the Chief Minister.”

Sources said that the KMF, being an autonomous body, can resolve to price hike. However, as protocol, the KMF seeks an approval from the government before effecting it. “The government can shoot down the proposal or modify it,” said sources.

State’s among cheapest

Meanwhile, Narasimha Murthy, president of Bengaluru Milk Union, which was among the first to seek the price hike, said that over the last three years, input costs like feed and fodder had gone up. Compared to the neighbouring States where milk prices start from ₹40 a litre, Mr. Murthy said that despite the hike, Karnataka will still be among those with the lowest milk price.

He said that of the hike amount 75% will be transferred to the farmers and the rest will be kept to maintain operational cost. “The proposal will be discussed on Friday. We are hopeful that our demands will be met,” he added.

Financial assistance

KMF chairman Balachandra Jarkiholi has said that they would appeal to the government to increase the financial incentive given to farmers by ₹1. The financial assistance to milk farmers was started in 2008 with ₹2 per litre during the earlier tenure of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, and is now at ₹5 a litre.

More products launched

The KMF, which markets a variety of dairy products under brand Nandini, on Thursday added more products to its portfolio. Among those launched by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa included processed cheese blocks and cubes, mozzarella, indigenous milk, a variety of natural fruit ice creams, Greek yoghurt, and milk rusk.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/milk-price-hike-to-be-discussed-at-kmf-board-meet-today/article30578284.ece
105,2020/01/16,Tipu lessons to be retained in coming academic year in Karnataka,"Even though the State government is yet to officially announce its decision on whether lessons pertaining to Mysuru king Tipu Sultan should be dropped or retained, it is clear that the lessons will be retained for the 2020-2021 academic year.

The Karnataka Textbook Society (KTBS) will complete issuing of work orders for textbooks in the next three or four days. The KTBS is in the process of issuing work orders for over 8 crore textbooks and workbooks. These books will be distributed to students from classes one to II PU. A total of 549 titles will have to be printed.

“We have got no directions on changes in the social science textbooks and lessons pertaining to Tipu Sultan will remain the same,” an official said. The official also said that the process of issuing orders cannot be delayed further as the firms which will bag the orders will have to be given 120 days time to supply the books to schools.

Sources in the Department of Primary and Secondary Education stated that the report was forwarded to S. Suresh Kumar, Primary and Secondary Education Minister, who was to take a call on the matter. The Minister had said that he would discuss the matter with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and later take a final decision.

“It has been decided to retain the lessons, but the government wants to give the issue a silent burial. It does not want to make a formal announcement because the BJP government wanted the lessons to be dropped, but the committee formed to look into this issue is keen on ensuring that students study about Tipu. The committee’s reports cannot be overruled,” said a source on the condition of anonymity.

The controversy regarding the lessons on Tipu Sultan was raised by Madikeri MLA Appachu Ranjan who had written to the department seeking removal of the lessons terming Tipu a “fanatic”. Subject experts who were part of the committee had argued that only “facts” pertaining to him were presented in the class six, seven and 10 textbooks and that he was “not glorified”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hr35mz/article30269484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGTIPU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tipu-lessons-to-be-retained-in-2020-21-academic-year/article30578112.ece
106,2020/01/16,Six trees axed for ‘security reasons’ ahead of Shah meet,"In an incident that has put the BJP leaders in an embarrassing situation, as many as six trees were axed to “provide security cover” to Home Minister Amit Shah, who is scheduled to address a pro-CAA rally in Hubballi on Saturday. Municipal authorities, however, insist that the trees were only “pruned”.

Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi, who visited Nehru Stadium to oversee the preparations, saw that six Ashoka trees were axed. When he arrived, the logs were in the process of being shifted. An angry Mr. Joshi took the workers to task and also the officials for allowing it to happen.

Mr. Joshi told presspersons that cutting the trees was unwarranted to facilitate any programme and that he had asked officials to take action against those involved. One of the police officials reportedly told the Union Minister that they had sought pruning of the branches for security reasons but the trees had been axed without informing them.

Municipal Commissioner Suresh Itnal said he had asked the zonal commissioner to submit a report within three days. However, he insisted that the trees had not been felled but pruned.

107,2020/01/16,‘Swachh’ survey: Roadside trash ‘dump sites’ sealed,"With less than two weeks for Swachh Survekshan-2020 to conclude, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) is coming up with new methods to ensure that the people do not throw garbage on the roadsides marring the city’s beauty as well as chances of Mysuru making it to the top in the ‘Swachh’ rank.

More than 13 major vacant sites where people used to dump solid wastes had been identified and these sites had been fenced using ropes or other means to stop the public from accessing them for throwing garbage. At these places, the MCC has put up notice boards warning the public not to throw trash. Those who do so will be penalised.

A MCC team is keeping a watch on these places since the sites had been recently cleared from the trash in view of the survey.

“We have fully spruced up these sites and containers where trash used to be dumped had also been removed. Our men and machines had been employed to free the sites from wastes. The MCC will not allow the public to throw trash at these places even after the survey,” said MCC Health Officer D. G. Nagaraj.

He told The Hindu that some conservancy lanes here used by the public as dump sites had been cleaned up recently and these lanes had been concretised.

“We are also taking the help of nearby CCTV footages (in private ownership) on those throwing garbage. Our people also monitor them in the morning and the evening. I myself go around these places and also others to ensure that trash is not thrown on the roadsides,” he added.

Another way of stopping public from throwing garbage was beautifying the dump sites. The beautification had been done through paintings, developing them into small lung spaces with plants and other ways.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/swachh-survey-roadside-trash-dump-sites-sealed/article30575597.ece

He told reporters that the CAA, which provides citizenship to Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Christians persecuted in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, was among things that the ABVP was fighting for.

Lot of misinformation about the CAA, National Register of Citizenship (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) was being spread by the Opposition parties. “We have come out with a comprehensive booklet on CAA,NRC and NPR by C.N. Shankar Rao in Kannada. This is being distributed in colleges, business establishments, apartments here.""

109,2020/01/16,NPR: Kerala to stick to its stance at meet,"Kerala would stick to its stand that it would not update the National Population Register (NPR) at a national meet convened by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner in New Delhi on Friday to discuss the census and NPR operations.

K.R. Jyothilal, Principal Secretary, General Administration, will inform the meeting that any attempt to carry out the updation of the NPR in Kerala would lead to a law and order situation and it may even thwart the 2021 census operations. However, the position of the census authorities to the stand is yet to be known. The Kerala government had issued an order on December 20 last year suspending the updation of the register after The Hindu reported on the preparations that were under way in the State. Before Kerala, West Bengal government had said ‘no’ to the NPR. The Kerala government had communicated to all the Collectors, who are to act as Principal Census Officers, about the administrative decision regarding the NPR.

Kerala would communicate to the Central authorities about the widespread apprehensions prevailing in the State that the updation of the NPR would eventually lead to the preparation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The apprehension about the process gained strength after the Centre passing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, sources privy to the developments said.

Circular

Meanwhile, the government has issued a circular to District Collectors informing them that all proceedings for updating the National Population Register (NPR) have been put on hold. The communication issued by General Administration Principal Secretary K.R. Jyothilal said it had come to the notice of the government that certain census officials had mentioned the updating of the NPR in the files relating to the 2021 census. It warned that stern action would be taken against such officials if they were found to repeat this.

Last month, the government had decided in principle to put on hold all activities related to the NPR in the wake of apprehension that updating the NPR would eventually lead to the preparation of the National Register of Citizens.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/npr-state-to-stickto-its-stance-at-meet/article30579280.ece

115,2020/01/16,SFI to reform policies after two decades,"For the first time in over two decades, the Students’ Federation of India (SFI), the students’ wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI (M)], has embarked on a mission to reorient its policies in the State.

The move assumes significance as it has come against the backdrop of unsavoury incidents that have put the organisation in the dock in recent times.

Discussions

In a bid to reform the organisation in accordance with modern day challenges, the SFI has commenced discussions at various levels to revise its policy document that has been its driving force since its adoption in 1997. While outlining the responsibilities of the organisation, the draft document also calls for incorporating changes in its style of functioning.

The discussions have centred on the nature of activism and student leadership that could be pursued in campuses henceforth.

The organisation, which has publicly decried violent tendencies that have disrupted peace in colleges of late, also touched upon regressive practices among the student community.

CPI (M) State secretariat member and former SFI national president K.N. Balagopal, who inaugurated a State-level convention that was organised here on Thursday to initiate the discussions, lashed out at those who sought to impose stringent controls on campus activism, which has been branded as disruptive by various sections.

Freedom of expression

Attempts to muffle the freedom of expression of the student community must be opposed at all costs, he said.

SFI national president V.P. Sanu, State secretary Sachin Dev and president Vineesh V.A. led the discussions.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sfi-to-reform-policies-after-two-decades/article30579240.ece
116,2020/01/16,Ordinance: Orthodox faction to approach SC,"Holding that the Ordinance promulgated by the State government on the burial rituals of church members will lead to anarchy in cemeteries, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church has announced its plans to approach the Supreme Court against the move.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Orthodox Church leaders maintained that the Ordinance would have far-reaching implications as far as the various church denominations of Kerala were concerned.

“The Ordinance, which appears to be vague in its definition of clauses, will affect all churches. It is unfortunate that the administrators are trying to sabotage the judicial system through an Ordinance for their political gains,” said synod secretary Yuhanon Mar Diascoros. For instance, the first clause says a parishioner is qualified to be buried in the cemetery of the church where his ancestors have been buried. However, no definition has been given as to who is an ancestor. It has also not been clearly said who is the authority to establish that. one This Ordinance is a secret ploy to circumvent the order of the Supreme Court in the Chuch case, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ordinance-orthodox-faction-to-approach-sc/article30579230.ece

The proposal had been pending since 1989. Suggestions received from dioceses of the Church had been taken into consideration while revising the liturgy, the synod said in its communication. Once the revised liturgy is approved by Rome it will come into force. The bishops said the synod stood for liturgical unity in the Church. The synod approved the appointment of Jose Pulikkal as auxiliary bishop of Kanjirappally, who will eventually succeed Bishop Mathew Arakkal.

118,2020/01/16,Literature fest opens with lively discussions,"The Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) got off to a fine start on the Kozhikode Beach on Thursday. Several sessions, on a wide array of themes, made the opening day a memorable one for the large crowd that thronged the beach from the morning.

Varied themes like politics, history, gender, mythology, climate, sports, science, medicine, art, travel, casteism and economics were in focus, besides literature.

Among the more lively sessions were the two featuring Carnatic singer and writer T.M. Krishna, who articulated his views on music, the national anthem, his role as an activist, and his latest book, Sebastian and Sons, which is about the making of the mridangam. He explained to an avid audience how the outlook on his music changed as he evolved.

Devdutt Pattanaik, who has to his credit several books on mythology, could also engage his audience with his two sessions, on spirituality and gender. The dialogue between two of Malayalam’s most respected writers Anand and K. Satchidananan on contemporary India was another highlight.

Recitation by poets from overseas, such as Keith Jarrett and Adeena Karasick, also proved popular.

The four-day festival was inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, in the presence of chief guest Thani Bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, UAE Minister for Climate Change and Environment, among others.

“It is remarkable that the KLF has emerged as a major event for Malayalis over the last five years,” Mr. Vijayan said. “This festival also addresses the concerns our country faces at the moment.”

He said there were very few events like the KLF that talked about different issues. “We have to note that the presence of the young men and women is increasing every year at this festival,” he said. “We have seen how the youth has reacted to some of current issues. They, especially the students, have registered their protests. There are forces that encourage jingoism and racism,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/j4dlpp/article30579222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV17KOZFESTDD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/literature-fest-opens-with-lively-discussions/article30579216.ece
119,2020/01/16,KAS exam: leave by govt. staff affects work,"The General Administration Department has asked the Chief Minister’s office to issue a directive to a host of government Secretariat employees, including 50 assistants, who have gone on leave to prepare for the maiden Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) preliminary examination, to join duty soon.

The note issued by General Administration Secretary K.R.Jyothilal says the mass leave has derailed the routine functions of the Secretariat and would derail the functioning of various departments, especially since the Assembly session is scheduled to begin on January 31.

Going on leave to try for another job reflects the lack of social commitment of the employees.

It causes a lot of difficulties for the public as the government could not request the Public Service Commission to recruit fresh hands to fill the vacancies. Hence, the government should discourage the attempts of employees for career advancement at the cost of serving the public, the note says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kas-exam-leave-by-govt-staff-affects-work/article30579214.ece

Talking to The Hindu, Mr. Peethambaran said he would lead the party till February/March next year when organisational elections would be held.

In the last quarter of the year, there would be a membership drive till December end and the process of election to various posts from the grassroots would begin, he said.

121,2020/01/16,"Era of Resident over, CM hits back at Governor","Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan lashed out at Governor Arif Mohammed Khan for criticising the State government for going on appeal against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the Supreme Court.

Addressing a rally organised by the Constitution Protection Forum here on Thursday evening, Mr. Vijayan reminded Mr. Khan that there were no Resident over the government elected by the people of Kerala.

British legacy

The British government used to appoint Residents over the princely States in India.

“But this is a democratically elected government and there are no such Residents in this setup,” he said. The Chief Minister said the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) agenda to destroy the country’s secular fabric would not work in the State.

“We will not have detention centres in Kerala as part of implementing the draconian laws of the Central government,” he said.

Although the CAA was targeting Muslims in the country, it was not an issue of only Muslims. “This is an issue affecting the country’s secular fabric,” he said.

Presiding over the function, Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama president Syed Jiffri Muthukoya Thangal asked the Central government to do justice to the Constitution by which it had taken oath.

In a letter to the State Police Chief (SPC), the NCM expressed apprehension that at least 21 persons among those suspected to have left Kerala to join the Islamic State in Afghanistan and Syria were neophytes who converted to Islam from Christianity.

The first session of the 28th synod of the Syro-Malabar Church, which met in Kochi recently, had expressed concern at the rising cases of love jihad. It had also expressed anxiety over Christian girls being killed in love ‘entanglements’.

These love affairs adversely affected society and law enforcement agencies should take urgent action in these instances, the Synod said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ncm-seeks-police-report-on-love-jihad/article30579187.ece
123,2020/01/16,Situation better at Paliyekkara,"After a day’s chaos, the scene at the Paliyekkara toll plaza was slightly better after non-FASTag vehicles got to use 25% of the tracks.

Considering the rush at toll plazas, the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways postponed the date for mandatory implementation of FASTag at 25% of the tracks at 65 toll plazas, including Paliyekkara. But allotment of 25% of the tracks for non-FASTag vehicles was not effective in controlling the rush.

The Paliyekkara toll plaza witnessed kilometres-long queues on Thursday too, even after four tracks, two on both sides each, started receiving money.

Double pass facility

However, the double pass facility (toll ticket for both sides) for non-FASTag vehicles has been disallowed from Thursday, with people taking ticket for each journey.

Earlier, those planning to return within 24 hours had to play only ₹105 for both sides, while the toll for one way was ₹75.

Now, they have to pay ₹75 for each journey. However, FASTag holders have to pay only ₹105.

The situation went out of control on Wednesday as the majority of vehicles were without FASTag.

Only one track on each side was allotted for non-FASTag vehicles and the queue extended till Amballoor on one side.

It took almost two hours to cover the distance from Amballoor to the plaza. Toll officials and the police were helpless in controlling the rush. Even ambulances were trapped in the rush.

Meanwhile, Education Minister C. Ravindranath, who is the local MLA, gave a letter to the project director of the National Highways Authority of India and the Public Works Minister for a solution to the issue of free passes for local people at the plaza.

The issue was raised with the authorities and a demand had been made for free passes for the local people, he said. He also demanded that the first track be allotted to the local people.

Meanwhile, Thrissur District Congress Committee vice president Joseph Taget criticised the government for failing to find a solution for the issue.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gvcqx0/article30579564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv17thrisssrfat,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/situation-better-at-paliyekkara/article30579181.ece
124,2020/01/16,1.25 lakh families given title deeds: Minister,"The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government has distributed title deeds to 1.25 lakh families in the State, Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan has said.

He was inaugurating the district ‘pattaya mela’ at the SDV Centenary auditorium here on Thursday.

“With the completion of pattaya melas in Idukki, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram and Palakkad districts, the number of people who received title deeds in the last three years will touch 1.40 lakh in the State,” Mr. Chandrasekharan said.

The Minister distributed title deeds and possession certificates to 206 families in the mela. He said that it was the third pattaya mela to be organised in Alappuzha in as many years. “Since the LDF government came to power in 2016, we have distributed title deeds to 1,017 people in Alappuzha. It is important to produce basic land documents to receive benefits provided through local self-government institutions. The government has issued directions to all district collectors in the State to help people who face difficulty in obtaining documents from government departments,” he said.

Among those who received title deeds on Friday was 96-year-old Sarojini Amma, of Canal Ward in Alappuzha municipality. She received the title deed for five cents of land after a wait of 40 years.

Mr. Chandrasekharan further said the State government had completed the construction of two lakh houses under the Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment (LIFE) Mission in the State.

125,2020/01/16,Governor questions ordinance,"Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Friday said he had “few questions” about the ordinance that sought to increase the number of elected offices in Local Self-Government Institutions (LSGIs) by amending the Kerala Panchayati Raj and Kerala Municipality Acts.

Mr. Khan was yet to give his assent to the ordinance, which Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had termed as ‘‘suspiciously timed and violative of the provisions of the Census Act, 1948.” The ordinance seeks to add at least one more ward to each local body.

The “delay” was widely perceived as part of a broader political tug-of-war between the government and the Raj Bhavan.

The relationship had hit rough weather after ruling front politicians criticised Mr. Khan for questioning the legal sanctity of the Assembly resolution that demanded the repeal of the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). He had also come under attack for his defence of the CAA.

The Governor said he was no “rubber stamp.” He had “raised certain questions about the desirability of having an ordinance at this stage when the Assembly is going to meet after a few days.”

The Constitution expected him to apply his mind. It was his prerogative to ensure that the process of the ordinance was not used for “extraneous purposes.”

He had not chosen to speak to the press about the issue. But the Minister had openly commented on the unsettled matter. “So I am constrained to tell you that I have merely raised some questions,” he said. The State had the power to issue an ordinance. However, it was not proper on the part of the Minister to broach the matter until the constitutional authority reached an informed decision.

Mr. Khan said there was certain “sanctity about such matters, which could not be done in “instalments.” He said he would “take his time” and come to a conclusion. The “Constitution expects me to apply my mind,” he said.

He reminded reporters of the legal maxim that nobody was above the law, however, exalted a person’s stature. “I shall ensure that nobody tries to cross boundaries set by the Constitution and the law,” he said.

He said once he decided on the ordinance, he would plainly explain his position to the public.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-questions-ordinance/article30578045.ece
126,2020/01/16,Governor slams govt. over SC appeal,"Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has indicated that the State government has crossed the line by keeping him in the dark about its decision to appeal against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the Supreme Court.

Mr. Khan, who spoke to journalists at the airport on Thursday before leaving for Delhi, said he had learned about the development from newspapers.

Upping the ante in his politically volatile dispute with the government over the passage of a resolution in the Assembly opposing the CAA, Mr. Khan said he would examine whether a State could move the apex court against a Central law without the approval of the Governor.

Mr. Khan expressed dismay that he had to learn about the development from newspapers. “I do not dispute the right of the government or any entity or individual to appeal against any law in the Supreme Court. The government need not have taken my approval. But as the constitutional head of the State, they should have shown the courtesy to inform me,” he said.

Mr. Khan, who had faced street protests, black flag demonstrations and heckling at public functions for his support of the CAA, warned that “nobody could be a law on to oneself.”

“This is improper. It is a breach of courtesy and protocol. Nobody is above the law and constitution. Nobody can be allowed to blow up law enforcement,” he said.

The rules of the Assembly stated that the legislature should not discuss any subject which did not come under their constitutional jurisdiction.

However, the Kerala government had challenged the constitutional validity of a Central law in a subject which was not under its jurisdiction. There was no doubt that the government had ""transgressed and gone out of its jurisdiction,"" he said.

“Some people think they are above the law. If somebody has such a notion in their mind, let them get rid of it,” he said.

In an oblique dig at Mr. Khan, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in Malappuram that the era of British residencies lording over native princes were over. The legislature was not beholden to any superior political office.

Left Democratic Front (LDF) convener A. Vijayaraghavan accused Mr. Khan of politicking. Law Minister A.K.

127,2020/01/16,Govt. mulling Bill on ward delimitation,"The State government is likely to explore the possibility of piloting a Bill in the Assembly to address the reported discrepancies that had crept into the delimitation of local body wards in 2015 and also for completing the process well ahead of the elections due this year.

Local Administration Department sources told The Hindu that legal consultations had begun in this regard and on deciding to pilot the Bill, the legislature procedures could be completed by mid-February and the delimitation of wards, as proposed to add one ward each in every local body, could be completed by September.

This would help the State Election Commission (SEC) to issue the notification in September and conduct the elections within a set time-frame. Holding timely elections is one of the prime priorities of the government, sources said.

The decision to scale down the delimitation process to the bare minimum was made in view of the financial constraints of the government and to maintain the administrative boundary laid for the census for 2021 in tact.

Top priority has been attached to address the discrepancies that occurred in the delimitation of wards during the tenure of the previous government. The wards of 1,106 local bodies were delimited as per the census report of 2001 and 84 others on the basis of the 2011 census report.

This disparity in fixing the boundaries had led to an imbalance in executing development projects and the devolution of funds. Ward delimitation on the basis of the population figures in the preceding census report being a constitutional obligation, the government could neither shelve it nor shy away from the process, sources said.

The government had already addressed the concerns raised by the Opposition regarding the probable changes in door numbers. The door numbers will not be changed and the authority for renumbering houses in a ward vests with the local body concerned.

Each panchayat will have to resolve and notify its decision to change the numbers for tax collection and other purposes of the Revenue Department and hence the apprehensions raised in this regard are unfounded, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-mulling-bill-on-ward-delimitation/article30577528.ece
128,2020/01/16,Vehicle hold-ups at Kochi toll booths continue,"Compulsory enforcement of electronic toll payment (FASTag) from January 15 continued to affect traffic through two toll collection points near Kochi on Thursday with substantially long queues of vehicles being seen at Kumbalam on the NH 47 bypass and Ponnarimangalam on Container Road.

The traffic hold-up was only on the lanes allotted for cash payments, said an official of one of the toll collection companies. Vehicles with FASTag were cleared on the move while those making cash payment took up to a minute or more for clearing the boom barrier, the official said.

Though one more month has been provided for motorists to shift to the FASTag mode considering the traffic queues on Wednesday, vehicular movement continued to be hit at the two points.

At Ponnarimangalam, only a lane each on both sides has been provided for those making cash payments while four lanes each are available to those making electronic payment. Only 38% of the around 6,000-6,500 vehicles passing through the Ponnarimangalam toll gate had subscribed to the FASTag facility, said a spokesman for the toll collection company.

He said the company planned to sell FASTags on the road itself during the coming days.

Benefits

FASTag payment would not only speed up traffic movement but also make toll payment and collection transparent, he said.

At Kumbalam, two lanes each had been provided for vehicles using FASTag and cash payments. About 40-45% of the vehicles passing through the toll collection point had secured FASTag, said the spokesman. These included about 50% of the private buses using the highway. Around 20,000 pass through the toll booth each day. Three agencies, including private banks, have been facilitating the shift to FASTag at Kumbalam and about 10,000 fresh subscriptions were made in the past few days.

Residents exempted

129,2020/01/16,MBBS fee: HC raps fee committee,"The Kerala High Court has slammed the Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee for not refixing the fee structure of MBBS courses of self-financing medical colleges for academic years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19, after reconsidering the claims of the managements on a High Court directive.

The committee had earlier fixed the tuition fee at ₹4.15 lakh a student for the 2016-17 academic year, ₹4.80 lakh for 2017-18 and ₹5.54 lakh for 2018-19 for the MBBS course. When the managements had challenged the free structure, the court had set aside the committee's order and remitted the issue to the committee for its reconsideration.

Justice A.M. Shaffique, while criticising the committee, directed the managements to file statements containing the particulars regarding the cost of land and building, list and value of infrastructure, list of equipment, its value and life span, salary and allowances being paid to teaching and non-teaching staff, expenditure for the administration and maintenance of the institutions, surplus for the future development and other expenditure.

The court felt that if these figures were available and ascertained, the actual expenditure during the academic year concerned could be ascertained and would give a clear idea of the total expenditure the college may have to incur and when it is divided by the number of students, it should be the fee that could be fixed. The court directed the managements to file the statements in three weeks.

The managements in their petition pointed out that even after the matter was remitted to the committee and directed it to pass fresh orders, the committee did not consider their claims afresh. The committee had, in fact, confirmed its earlier fee structure.

The court observed that once an order passed by the committee was set aside by the court and the committee had been directed to consider the matter afresh in accordance with the law, the committee had to independently arrive at the free structure. There was no re-determination of the fee. The committee was expected to fix the fee based on the available materials and it could not have rejected the claims, stating that the material produced was insufficient.

The court said there was no application of mind by the committee while fixing the fee afresh.

Counsel for the students pointed out that they got admission in the colleges based on the fee structure fixed by the committee and if there was considerable increase in the free structure it would affect them.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mbbs-fee-hc-raps-fee-committee/article30577445.ece
130,2020/01/16,Senkumar demands probe against Natesan,"Former State Police Chief T.P. Senkumar has accused Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan of financial fraud and demanded a comprehensive investigation by Central agencies against him.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Mr. Senkumar alleged that Mr. Natesan had siphoned off ₹1,600 crore collected in the name of admissions and postings in educational institutions run by the Sree Narayana Trust and the Yogam. No receipts were issued by Mr. Natesan for the payments, he said.

“It calls for an investigation by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, the Income Tax Department and the Enforcement Directorate,'' he said, accusing Mr. Natesan of straying from the path set by Sree Narayana Guru and treating the Yogam as if it was his fiefdom.

Mr. Senkumar was accompanied by Subhash Vasu, general secretary, Bharath Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), who has launched a frontal attack against Mr. Natesan and his son and BDJS president Thushar Vellappally.

Mr. Senkumar and Mr. Vasu wanted Mr. Natesan to step down from the Yogam leadership to enable a democratic election process in the organisation. The Yogam should be placed under an administrator, ideally a retired judge, for the purpose, they said.

Saswathikananda’s death

Mr. Vasu demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the death of Swami Saswathikananda of the Sivagiri Madhom. Mr. Vasu said he harboured certain suspicions regarding the death.

131,2020/01/16,Archbishop’s stance lends fillip to anti-CAA stir,"Agitations against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, in Kerala got a major fillip on Wednesday with a veteran Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church voicing apprehensions about the Act and cautioning that it could be a prelude to eschewing democracy and migrating to a theocratic State.

Joseph Powathil, senior-most Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church that has a following of about 40 lakh and wields considerable clout in all realms of society, mainly education, has expressed his reservations about the Act when heads of other denominations have been maintaining a studied silence on the issue.

The veteran Archbishop who is known to react publicly on issues of social significance, has not minced words in his article on the church organ Deepika and said that the Act could be construed as a bid to drive a wedge between the Christian and the Muslim communities. The Left parties that are spearheading the anti-CAA protests had flagged the same concern and said that it was not an issue concerning Muslims alone.

Reasons cited

The Archbishop has cited valid reasons in support of his concerns. He has pointed the sporadic incidents of violence against Christian missionaries, about 300 in 2019 alone, slamming of false cases and the alleged reluctance of the ruling dispensation to register cases against them. Only 40 cases have been registered in 2019, he says.

Most importantly, he points out the apathy of the Centre in extending an invitation to the Pope, ignoring the wishes of the community in the country.

Failed attempts

This reaction comes at a time when the Bharatiya Janata Party leadership is making an all-out bid to reach out to the minorities, especially the Christian community in the State. A recent attempt of Union Minister Kiren Rijiju to woo writer George Onakkoor and Archbishop Soosa Pakiam M. got foiled since both of them refused to respond positively.

132,2020/01/16,Governor slams Kerala move to challenge CAA in Supreme Court,"Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Thursday indicated that the State government had crossed a line by keeping him in the dark about its decision to appeal the new citizenship law in the Supreme Court.

Upping the ante in his politically volatile dispute with the Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government over the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) enacted by the Parliament, Mr. Khan said he would examine whether a State could move the Supreme Court against a Central law without the approval of the Governor.

Mr. Khan expressed dismay that he had to learn about the development through newspapers and reporters who met him at the airport on his way to New Delhi.

“I do not dispute the right of the government or any entity or individual to appeal against the law in the Supreme Court. The government need not have taken my approval. But courtesy demanded that they at least kept me informed about the measure as the constitutional head of State,” he said.

Mr. Khan, who had faced street protests, black flag demonstrations and heckling at public functions for his support of the CAA, warned that “nobody could be a law unto oneself”.

“This is improper. It is a breach of courtesy and protocol. Nobody is above the law and constitution. Nobody can be allowed to blow up law enforcement,” he said.

The rules of the Assembly states that the Legislature shall not discuss any subject, which does not come under their constitutional jurisdiction.

However, the Kerala government has challenged the constitutional validity of the Central law in a subject which was not under its jurisdiction. There was no doubt that the government had “transgressed and gone out of its “jurisdiction”, he said.

“Some people think they are above the law. If somebody has such a notion in their mind, let them get rid of it. This will not be allowed. This will not happen”, he said.

Kerala Law Minister A. K. Balan attempted to play down the issue. He said the government had no dispute with the Governor. Mr. Balan said some quarters had conspired to create such an impression.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-slams-kerala-move-to-challenge-caa-in-supreme-court/article30575258.ece

The local police said a group of Maoists barged into the service villa and broke the door and window panes of the building. Curtains of the resort was also set on fire. The newly constructed resort is situating inside a coffee plantation on the fringes of the Meppadi forest range under South Wayanad forest division.

The resort is under the possession of one Jayadev in Bengaluru and a security guard was appointed to watch the six room building.

When the incidence was occurred there were nobody in the resort as the security guard was on leave .

The unidentified miscreants fled after sticking wall-posts on the building on behalf of the Nadukani area committee of the Communist Party of India (Maoist).

They said in the posters that the attack was a warning to the resort mafia who were trying to molest tribal women in the district .

The posters were also opposing the mushroom growth of resorts in tribal areas in the district, police said.

134,2020/01/16,Lakshadeepam marks culmination of Murajapam at Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple,"The 56- day Murajapam ritual at the Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple here culminated in a grand spectacle on January 15 with the temple and its precints bathed in the light of one lakh lamps signifying the Lakshadeepam festival. Colourful electric bulbs and earthen lamps lit up the temple gopuram and the banks of the Padmatheertham temple pond in an ethereal glow.

Around 200 vedic scholars including priests from Kanchipuram and Pejawar maths and representatives from various Brahmin associations and Yoga Kshema Sabhas in Kerala conducted the Murajapam which involves ceremonial chanting of the Vedas in seven sessions lasting eight days each. The idols of Sree Padmanabha Swamy, Narasimha and Thiruvambadi Sree Krishna were displayed at the seeveli procession held every eight days.

Cultural events including a light and sound show were conducted as part of the festivities.

Hoary tradition

The Murajapam dates back to the 18th century with the first edition held in 1747 during the reign of Anizham Tirunal Marthanda Varma, the architect of Travancore.

One of the main rituals of the Murajapam was the Jalajapam during which the priests stand in the Padmatheertham and chant hymns. The Jalajapam was revived this year after nearly a century.

Thousands of people from the city and other parts of the state and beyond turned up to witness the Lakshadeepam.

135,2020/01/16,The ‘Morning Show’ and life after #MeToo,"Warning: Spoilers ahead

Apple TV+ launched with much fanfare a couple of months ago, but it hasn’t exactly set the TV stage on fire. Of the four shows that premièred on the day of launch, the period dramedy, Dickinson, garnered the best reviews initially, yet it remains a niche show. The space opera, For All Mankind, started off with great promise but the charm wore off quickly. The most awful of the lot, undoubtedly, was the expensive fantasy epic, See, which is fashioned on Game of Thrones (it even features Jason “Drogo” Momoa), but is entirely clueless about its purpose.

Apple TV+’s flagship show is The Morning Show (TMS), created by Jay Carson, and featuring an ensemble of formidable actors: Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Steve Carell, Billy Crudup and Mark Duplass. Eerily similar to the real-life firing of morning news host Matt Lauer after sexual assault allegations surfaced against him, TMS taps into the post #MeToo world where both men and women must question their belief systems and conduct. In spite of this dynamic premise to play with, and that wonderful cast, TMS struggles to find its footing initially. I was convinced, in fact, after sampling the first three episodes that landed on Day One, that the show would turn out to be one of the big disappointments of 2019.

Admittedly, though, TMS gets better with each successive viewing. Certain issues remain, like, for example, the show’s obsession with one singular event of sexual assault at the workplace to build drama and intrigue, it’s over-reliance on soap opera-like theatrics, and its unwillingness to commit to its two principal characters, Alex Levy (Aniston) and Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon). Yet, with each episode, the writers take bolder, more outrageous dramatic decisions that, thankfully, land more often than not. The overall tone gets a lot more consistent, and things are tied up nicely in an explosive finale that validates some of the effort viewers have to put in to get there.

The most interesting thread the show pulls at is the grey area around consent. The assaulter, Mitch Kessler (Carell), truly believes there was willingness on the part of his victims. The audience, too, is made part of this guessing game, until the very last episode where Mitch’s victim, Hannah, explodes with her account of the assault. It’s a powerful scene, and Gugu Mbatha-Raw delivers a stirring monologue that completely shakes you up. Purely, on the basis of the finale, TMS does enough to show what it’s capable of achieving, which augurs well for Season 2 (already green-lit).

There’s ample evidence to prove that if the material is great, this cast can do wonders. Aniston gets to sink her teeth into a truly deserving role in ages, and she’s terrific as the conflicted, ambitious Alex. Duplass, playing The Morning Show’s executive producer, Charlie ‘Chip’ Black, is extremely watchable. The standout performer is Crudup, playing the smooth-talking, smarmy network executive Cory Ellison. Watching him serenade Aniston with an impromptu duet is pure magic — the kind of TV moment we want more of in 2020.

Season One of The Morning Show is now streaming on Apple TV+

136,2020/01/16,‘A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood’ movie review: A magical Tom Hanks in a much-needed film,"What can you say about a film which begins with Tom Hanks singing: “It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor; Would you be mine? Could you be mine? … Please won’t you be my neighbor?” The song sets your cynicism to rest and makes your spirits soar, as does the film itself.

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood has Hanks playing Fred Rogers, the much-loved host of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood, a show that held young America in thrall late 60s onwards (running from 1968 to 2001). The film kicks off just the way each episode of the show would begin, with Rogers singing while walking on the set, taking off his jacket and getting into a sweater, taking off his shoes and putting on the sneakers. He would go on to talk about dark, difficult topics like death, war, divorce with his primary audience: children just back home from school.

Rogers was the subject for Won’t You Be My Neighbor?, Morgan Neville’s documentary that came out in 2018. Heller’s film, however, is inspired from “Can You Say … Hero?” Tom Junod’s 1998 article in Esquire. It’s about the transformational impact of Rogers on the life of a fictionalised Junod, the cynical journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys), who is assigned to profile the iconic TV host. The kind of “puff piece” he doesn’t want to do. In the course of their interaction, how Rogers helps him find peace with his estranged father Jerry (Chris Cooper), who had abandoned the family when Lloyd was a child forms the crux of the film.

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Director: Marielle Heller

Starring: Tom Hanks, Matthew Rhys, Chris Cooper, Susan Kelechi Watson

Run time: 108.47 minutes

Storyline: Esquire journalist Lloyd Vogel finds his own life flipping when he is assigned to profile the much-loved television host Fred Rogers

It is an oft-repeated tale of callousness, guilt, remorse, forgiveness and reconciliation, of facing up to unresolved fears and sorrows and putting the ghosts of the past to rest. The inventiveness is in Heller’s telling, how she breaks down and reconstructs space and time in her narrative rather than lay it out linear and straight. The way she constantly moves and shifts between the TV set of the Neighborhood of Make Believe (what the show is called in the film) and Lloyd’s reality and uses not just the music, format, visuals, characters and guests but also the actual props and puppets of the show. She makes us enter the life of Lloyd with Rogers through the TV show and also brings him on to the set to turn the show into a space for therapy, not just for Lloyd, but a mass healing of sorts for several broken souls like him.

It’s a two-pronged thing. On one hand, Lloyd finds his own life turning upside down, for the better through the intervention of Rogers. On the other, through the flipping of his life one gets to see and understand Rogers’ philosophy and comprehend his way of life. He is himself not quite a “Living Saint”, is far from perfect and bringing up two of his own sons may not quite have been the ideal of parenthood as one may expect of him. There may also be an evangelical air about Rogers, but ultimately it’s not sermonising so much as warmth, empathy, simplicity that work. Lloyd might think that it’s writers who are changing the “broken world with our words” but it’s Rogers’ ability to draw him out, have a conversation with him and help him deal with “ the mad he feels” that fixes Lloyd. They are a study in contrast. One a font of positivity, other doesn’t care about humanity. Yet one is brave enough to unburden to the other, and the other willing to bear and help deal with it.

It’s the trio of a measured Hanks (noone else could possibly have become the wholesome, all-American Rogers), a quietly distraught Rhys with his close-ups of lingering pain (perhaps the most under-appreciated performance this year) and the blusterous Cooper who are the heart and soul of the film.

There are many obvious truths here: how it’s hardest to forgive someone we love, how it’s most difficult to release someone close to us from the anger and hurt we are nursing against them, how no normal life is free of pain, and how good, bad, sad and glad have to co-exist.

A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood might make a certain demographic in America go nostalgic for its slice of lost childhood, but also manages to reach out to the world at large. It’s about the universal capability of loving and also the essential need and longing for being loved. Its message of forgiveness and compassion can’t be better understood than in these fractured, fissured times where narratives are being built on hatred and “othering” than togetherness and harmony.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/x3q29e/article30577111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Beautiful,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/a-beautiful-day-in-the-neighborhood-movie-review-a-magical-tom-hanks-in-a-much-needed-film/article30577112.ece
137,2020/01/16,"Vishnu Vishal pens emotional post on dealing with divorce, depression and alcoholism","Vishnu Vishal has constantly seemed like one of the busiest and well-liked actors in the Tamil film industry. With hits like Velainu Vandhutta Vellaikaaran and Ratchasan in recent years, the star’s career path has been on an upward trajectory and his fandom has only increased with every passing year.

However, the actor’s divorce from his wife in 2017 — after 11 years — and the subsequent aftermath left him a broken man whose personal and professional life has been in limbo for the last two-and-half years, Vishnu has revealed in an emotional post on Twitter.

Speaking about how he turned to alcohol as a means of coping with the divorce (as well as the effect it had on their son), Vishnu recounts that he spent several sleepless nights, which in turn made him physically sick resulting in surgery. Moreover, he also came under financial woes, and his own production house faced issues that resulted in him dropping a movie he had shot almost a month for.

I took the VAARANAM AAYIRAM way



P.S - Sorry for the long letter but i had to put my heart out to all my lovely fans and friends :)

#motivation #lifelessons #thewayback #train #painandgain #facingchallenges pic.twitter.com/jKWHzahoHR — VISHNU VISHAL - VV (@TheVishnuVishal) January 16, 2020

Another major injury on the sets of the Prabhu Solomon film Kaadan resulted in him being bed-ridden for nearly three months and putting on 11 kgs, while eight of his films were cancelled.

Vishnu continues in the same vein to state that he didn’t even notice how badly his condition affected those around him, such as his family members. Until he finally did, and decided to take control.

The actor saw a therapist regularly, went back to working out under a trainer, and eating healthy, as he also made critical lifestyle choices such as blocking out judgemental people and spending time off social media. With time, he was able to regain his health — both mental and physical — and is currently working on his next film FIR, with four more projects lined up.

Vishnu added that the reason for his Twitter post was to tell people that they can bounce back from a bad period in their lives anytime, with discipline and positivity. He goes on to thank all those who stuck by him through trying times, saying that everyone is only answerable to their conscience, loved ones and family.

On Twitter, he even likened his journey to Suriya’s character from the GVM film Vaaranam Aayiram, in which the lead character undergoes a period of depression, alcoholism and drug abuse after his girlfriend dies. Vishnu termed it the ‘Vaaranam Aayiram’ way.

The actor’s post comes as a refreshing portrayal of truth and openness, at a time when most stars only use social media to promote their films or thank their associates. Vishnu also shared pictures of himself before and after his injury, as well as the ripped physique he’s flaunting currently after months of intense preparation for his next film.

FIR, directed by Manu Anand, is set for a summer 2020 release. The movie is touted to revolve around a Muslim youngster whose life is derailed into confusion as he gets caught up in a series of unfortunate incidents. The film also stars Gautham Menon, Manjima Mohan, Raiza Wilson and Reba Monica John.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i2e6mh/article30576815.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vishnu1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vishnu-vishal-pens-emotional-post-on-dealing-with-divorce-depression-and-alcoholism/article30576816.ece
138,2020/01/16,"We can disagree with each other but we can't be so intolerant, says Parvathy Thiruvothu","Parvathy Thiruvothu plans to turn director in 2020-2021 and is busy gathering material for two scripts that she is working on. In the city to participate in the concluding segment of the annual Soorya Dance and Music Festival, the actor meets MetroPlus at Cafe Jade, Hycinth, for a free-wheeling conversation about her work as a founder-member and spokesperson of the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) and her thoughts regarding the current season of discontent.

What is happening to Rachiyamma, a short film based on progressive writer Uroob’s story that is part of an anthology directed by four filmmakers?

Rachiyamma is brilliant in my head because Venu sir is so brilliant. When I met him, I had certain concerns about the story. Back when it was published, it was one of the most progressive short stories to come out. But we are living in 2020 now and much has changed in terms of feminism, equality… So from the point of view of a woman, I suggested a more balanced adaptation in terms of portraying, in film or in a story, a woman making choices and drawing boundaries. When I told him this, he was very intrigued. Venu sir wanted to know what my points of concern were. He was open to finding ways to incorporate the elements I found pertinent. I worked with Asif, who, like me, is full of questions but that is because he is so in love with his work. We had really great conversations and debates. This process is what makes a movie so worthwhile for me. It’s a team effort to find so many meanings.

The surprise was doing a cameo for Halal Love Story, directed by Zakariya Mohammed and written by Muhsin Parari. I had wanted to be part of a different genre. Halal... is a big departure from the usual genres of films I’ve done. I can’t give away much about the movie but I’m very excited to explore unchartered territory.

How about Varthamanam?

I finished dubbing and editing is going on. It is about intolerance. It came to me three years ago, when the beginning of intolerance was sparking and I thought it was the right time for a film on that, turns out now is even better a time for such a film to come. Everybody in the film, like the director Siddharth Siva, actor Roshan Mathew and I have our own political leanings but one thing we are all against is intolerance.

What is the story about?

Varthamanam is about the political awakening of a research student. It is also interesting for me because a lot of students in Kerala send me bizarre messages like ‘Oh, you are only interested in what is happening in the Central government in New Delhi, you are not responding to whatever is happening in Kerala’. It seems that Kerala is so insulated from everything else.

I feel that difference in the way you are treated, the way political discourses are hushed. I know the way the fear in people is palpable whereas in Kerala I can just talk like this in a public space. It’s easier to have a dialogue here.

At the same time, last year I realised the masks are off in Kerala too. They are not acknowledging enough their biases and their phobias as evidently as it is outside the State. It is masked with a lot of niceties and politeness in political dialogues. Many don’t even acknowledge that Islamophobia exists to the extent it does in Kerala. Here, it exists and in excess. It is a thick, viscous stream that is flowing underground. For me, it always starts with self-reflection. I wonder what action or statement of mine was slightly phobic of a particular community. I try to catch that.

Would you play a character who is not like you?

I would love to take that up, it just matters what the movie stands up for. I am always ready to do characters that Parvathy does not agree with at all. I thought Anu (her character in Virus) was not like me. But then I realied that though outwardly I am not like Anu, I am a recovering ‘people pleaser’. Do the right thing for yourself rather in give in to the deep-rooted fear that people might like you better if you keep pleasing them.

That is the best part of the job. You get to explore so many of your own facets…

When will you turn director?

End of this year. I have some travelling and couple of acting projects to complete. By November-December, I will start the prep. The directing, the actual on-set process will be in 2021. I am way too excited about moving to that side of the camera.

Will you be scripting as well?

I will be co-scripting it. The subjects I have started preparing, out of which one has a strong political background while the other one has a psychological space between two people (a thriller), needs immense research. As an actor, I crave for information so that I have those at the tip of my fingers wherever I wish to use them. I would probably need ten times more (information) as a director. I am enjoying the process, the research part of it has its merits. And this is when the movie is actually made, in my head. On set, you will never have the time to do anything. You will have to make do with what it there.

When will Sivaranjiniyum Sila Pengalum be released?

It is already doing the rounds of film festivals. But I don’t know when it will be released in cinemas.

Any Hindi films in the offing?

I did get offers but not the kind of stuff I wanted to do. I am very ambitious about the kind of subjects I wish to do. I can’t settle for anything less. Tanuja’s (Tanuja Chandra who directed Qarib Qarib Singlle) offer came to me like a miracle. I wanted to do a romcom for a long time and I got one with none other than Irfan Khan. It was a dream team. But for me, Malayalam is right now a fertile ground to keep sowing and ploughing. It would be great if I get an opportunity in Bollywood or any industry.

But I find my heart is way more invested in Malayalam now. And if I am to take myself away from here, where I can plant an idea and have enough and more people to come and support it without being afraid of the market and names, then if I have to go to Bollywood, the offer has to be that tempting.

No one is doing anyone a favour. I offer a service and if my service comes handy for a project in Bollywood, I would be happy to work.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/s92oj4/article30576374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tvmpParvathyThiruvothu1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/parvathy-thiruvothu-on-the-current-unrest-in-cinema-and-society-her-plans-to-turn-director-and-future-projects/article30576375.ece

He is seated in a cycle rickshaw in front of his plasticware shop at Kasi Chetty Street. “It’s the Rickshawkaran pose,” he says, speaking over phone. A die-hard fan of MG Ramachandran — the man says he actually “worships” the actor — Anand has set up an exhibition of photos taken during various stages of MGR’s life.

Displayed on a rectangular cardboard screen in front of his shop, the two dozen black-and-white photos are just a drop from the 53-year-old’s collection of over 15,000 photos. Anand’s exhibitions are a regular fare — he sets them up to commemorate birthdays and other occasions in the lives of leaders such as Gandhi, Nehru, and Netaji; personalities such as Thomas Alva Edison; and important days in world history.

“I have put up photos of MGR taken along with people from the film industry, apart from some shot when he was filming,” explains Anand. He points to a picture taken during the filming of Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum in which the actor is seen in the costume of an emperor, standing alongside the director, reading something, presumably his lines from the script.

Anand has met the actor-politician 13 times. He particularly remembers an incident in 1986, when he was assisting a friend who was videotaping the wedding of an AIADMK member in Saidapet. “MGR had come for the event,” recalls Anand. “He was standing on the stage and I was near him, holding the flash lights.” New on the job, Anand kept flashing the lights on MGR’s face. “I had no idea that this was disturbing him,” he says. “MGR signalled to me twice to turn it off. But I did not understand what he was trying to say.”

Finally, the videographer gave Anand a shout out. “When I did turn off the flash, MGR caught my eye and smiled warmly at me,” he recalls. “I will never forget that smile.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9t263f/article30576104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17mpAnand2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/die-hard-fan-of-mgr/article30576107.ece
140,2020/01/16,"‘Uriyadi’ is a laugh riot, says director AJ Varghese","Perhaps, there’s no need to feel any apprehension if these cops are in charge. Notwithstanding crime-fighting, they are also looking to have some fun off-duty. Uriyadi, directed by AJ Varghese, zooms in on the lives of a bunch of policemen and their families as they grapple with the thrills and spills of an Onam celebration. The film is set to hit the marquee today (January 17).

“The story is set in the Police Quarters in the capital city. From senior police officers to constables to gunmen, we get to see a cross-section of the police hierarchy as they come together as a single unit under a residence association to take on a different mission — to ensure that their Onam celebrations go as planned. There are no senior or junior officers here. Everyone just wants to make sure there are no goof-ups from their part,” says Varghese over the phone.

Varghese, who previously helmed the Dhyan Sreenivasan-starrer horror comedy Adi Kapyare Kootamani, avers that Uriyadi is not your usual cops-chasing-criminals story though there are elements of a thriller as well. “The film shows a different side to policemen as we get to see their domestic and personal lives. It’s an attempt to bust a perception of the police as being merely tough, cynical law-enforcers,” he says.

Varghese says a highlight of Uriyadi is the “big, ensemble comedy cast” as the flick brings together the likes of Sreenivasan, Siddique, Prem Kumar, Baiju, Indrans, Aju Varghese, Bijukuttan, Sudhi Koppa, Noby Marcose among others, while Arya Satheesh Babu and Manasa Radhakrishnan play prominent roles. “There are quite a few characters who are given equal importance. It’s not a typical hero-driven movie. There’s a bit of social satire as well,” he points out.

Uriyadi is scripted by debutant writer Dinesh Damodar, and Varghese says the former struck upon the idea for the film while visiting the Police Quarters near Palayam during Onam once. “He got to witness a different scene from what he was expecting. We felt we could spin it into a nice story,” says the director.

AJ Varghese | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Shot predominantly at the real Police Quarters itself, Varghese says the city serves as a relevant backdrop to the story, so much so that it becomes “a character” in itself. “The film was shot entirely in the city. The policemen and their families at the Quarters were truly supportive and accommodative during the shoot. However, we did not want to caricature the Thiruvananthapuram dialect in the dialogues as the characters hail from different parts of the State and the place essentially works as a melting pot of Malayalis,” he explains. Varghese, a native of Pathanapuram in Kollam, says that on a personal level, he has a close association with the city, which he has made his “home” now.

The filmmaker says the title has significance for the mood of the story. “The film is all about laughter and celebration, just like the traditional game of uriyadi played during Onam. More than the blindfolded participants, it’s often more interesting for the viewers. But the thrill of the game is in somebody eventually smashing the uri (pot), who becomes the hero for the day. That’s the kind of atmosphere we have endeavoured to capture in the movie too,” he says.

In line with the spirit of the flick, Uriyadi has six songs, set to tune by Ishaan Dev who makes a comeback in Mollywood after eight years. The lines are penned by Anil Panachooran.

It detailed how juveniles in Jamtara sought credit card details from people around the country to siphon off money, and the ways in which they carefully covered up their tracks. “It was very intriguing,” says Padhi, whose team made multiple visits to the district. “These children are school dropouts,” he says, adding how the district relies primarily on agriculture, while vishing constitutes a large parallel economy.

Brothers at play

The series revolves around cousins Sunny Mondal (Sparsh Shrivastava) and Rocky (Anshumaan Pushkar) and their group of successful teenage conmen. Tensions rise and splinter the group by the brothers’ differing aspirations. And brought in to tackle this mushrooming issue is the young and determined Superintendent of Police, Dolly Sahu (Aksha Pardasany).

Against this backdrop, we often watch women rarely being taken seriously — from being pursued by men as rewards for their financial success, to seeing their efforts to make strides in their lives and careers dismissed — but, as Padhi stresses, “Jamtara cannot be told without Dolly and Gudiya.” While Gudiya weaponises English in their scams, Dolly pulls together the first organised crackdown on Jamtara’s transgressions.

Show me the money

The show also alludes to how this relentless pursuit of money is brought on by greed, the need to support families, and a desperation to redraw the caste and class lines that make power and respect hover beyond reach.

“[The show] is a blend of fact and fiction,” says Padhi. While the germ of a story may be found in details like the 2017 arrest of the Mondal brothers and the female Jamtara Superintendent, Jaya Roy, the presence of Munna and Bachha (Rohit KP and Harshit Gupta) as the perpetually stoned and intoxicated omniscient narrators lends the story the weight of an epic tale from the hinterlands. “Their function is like the three witches of Macbeth,” he says of the two characters — sometimes giggling in the background, sometimes gravely drawing parallels between Jamtara’s stories and the Mahabharata. “Like Narad Muni. The two advance the story and increase the tension.”

Their research involved travelling around the district with local police. “We would sneak in secretly,” he says, “The police took us to places where a remote control opens their home.” Padhi recollects a moment the police didn’t believe some of the tactics the young men use to hide their trail: “One boy demonstrated by putting ₹5,000 in the policeman’s account!”

Staying true

Padhi has been riveted by, and retold, true stories before. His début feature, the Manoj Bajpayee-starrer and winner of the National Award for Best Children’s Film, Budhia Singh (2016) was on the child marathon runner from Odisha. The director thrived on the grey shades of the narrative, refusing to gloss over the dark bits of the story — a coach relentlessly pushing a five-year-old to train running long distances, irrespective of the scorching heat and his parched throat.

Here too, the director was careful not to caricaturise the setting. “Jamtara is very beautiful,” he says, “[we didn’t want to use] any gimmicks. We [didn’t want] to show ugliness or messiness just to titillate. [And] we didn’t want to judge anybody — all the characters are grey.”

142,2020/01/16,Kollywood power couple Sarathkumar and Radikaa on reuniting on-screen with 'Vaanam Kottatum',"Cinema is an integral part of the Sarathkumar-Radikaa household. Their drawing room is decked with awards and posters from their films, which reminds one of the big draw the duo was at the box-office and small screen.

That impact remains. While Sarathkumar is doing a host of big films now, Radikaa still rules the small screen, with a successful game show (Kodeeswari) she hosts.

This year they return to the big screen as a couple after two decades in the upcoming film Vaanam Kottatum, produced by Mani Ratnam.

In a chat with MetroPlus, the power couple of Kollywood talk about cinema, dinner table conversations and more:

Every film has a USP. What is the USP of Vaanam Kottatum ?

SK: The subject is quite intense, but it has entertainment value. It revolves around values and culture, and how society should be, though it isn’t a message-oriented film.

Radikaa: It was a different subject for both of us; a lot of people have been asking us to do films together in the past, but we were never really convinced. But the moment we heard the storyline of VK, we knew we were on board.

How was it going together to the sets after a while?

Radikaa: It has been 22 years since we last did that (smiles). It was a wonderful experience that we shared screen space in a project that gave us good scenes.

The teaser looks young, but there seems to be a strong storyline with the two of you in it...

SK: The film will revolve around what’s happening with us. It is an emotion-based subject.

How much of ‘producer’ Mani Ratnam’s involvement was present in the film, considering he is busy with his own directorial project?

Radikaa: He co-wrote the story and was very involved. Dhana (the director) was a focussed filmmaker.

Speaking of Mani Ratnam, you had a cameo in his first film, Pagal Nilavu (1985), at a time when you were very new to acting...

Radikaa: I think Mani Ratnam made a big mistake casting me as a classical dancer in that film.

It was very difficult because I had to get trained... by a very young dancer who used to move brilliantly (laughs).

And now Sarathkumar has landed a vital role in the filmmaker’s magnum opus project, Ponniyin Selvan ...

SK: I like the way it is shaping up. They are particular about the way I look, the costumes and the make-up for now.

We have done a preliminary photo-shoot, and I will start filming soon. Many people have attempted to do Ponniyin Selvan, but I think Mani sir will pull it off.

I’m sure he has put his heart and soul into the research, and he will come out in flying colours when the film hits screens.

Radikaa has described herself as ‘work-oriented’ in the past. How would you describe yourself?

SK: Well, I’m also a work-oriented person. I try balancing cinema, politics and philanthropic work.

So, what do dinner table conversations at your house revolve around?

Radikaa: We don’t speak about cinema at all, but we do discuss a bit of politics. We also like exchanging thoughts about current affairs. Sometimes, we aren’t on the same page, but we are a close-knit family, and we love our Sundays.

SK: Being public personalities, we would like to give an informed opinion about any issue. Our conversations at the dining table are more like an exchange of knowledge and thoughts.

What’s the most adventurous thing you have done as a couple?

Radikaa: Trekking in Scotland!

SK: Oh yes. We also want to do skydiving, though I’m not sure if my BMI will allow me to try that.

What is the one professional aspect about the other that you admire, and would like to imbibe?

Radikaa: His perseverance. If he wants to do something, he will get it done somehow.

SK: Her dedication. She’s very clear with what she wants. I think we complement each other.

You meet so many inspirational women in Kodeeswari . Meanwhile, women are having a big impact in cinema these days, with roles being written specifically for them in the lead. Would you say that it is a great phase to be a woman?

Radikaa: It is. I felt that a few years ago itself. When I came in the Eighties, I had a different outlook, and people couldn’t digest my way of thinking. Today’s women are very clear about their paths.

In the film world, there are still a lot of stories relating to women that need to be told... we have just touched the tip of the iceberg now.

What are you looking forward to in 2020?

SK: Apart from Vaanam Kottatum and Ponniyin Selvan, there’s a film with Sasikumar that has a well-knit storyline, a thriller titled Rendavathu Aattam. I am in talks with director Barath Neelakantan on a possible feature. There’s the rural drama Peranthal Parasakthi that will see Radikaa, my daughter Varalaxmi and me joining hands.

I am also playing a farmer in a Kannada film that will lay emphasis on the importance of agriculture in the years to come. I hope this year, stories and subject will be the hero rather than the person starring in it.

You have conquered the TV serial space, but the future looks to be the web series space...

Radikaa: We are eyeing that segment as well. We have tied down a few scripts that I will star in, and we will start work on it soon.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/o1c0v/article30575683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17MPSARATHKRAD,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kollywood-power-couple-sarathkumar-and-radikaa-on-reuniting-on-screen-with-vaanam-kottatum/article30575685.ece
143,2020/01/16,‘Game of Thrones’ spin-off ‘House of the Dragon’ will premiere only in 2022,"The Game of Thrones spin-off titled House of the Dragon is likely to premiere in 2022.

HBO programming chief Casey Bloys told this to variety.com during the Television Critics Assn. tour on Wednesday, calling it his “best guess”.

He was not able to narrow down a more precise premiere date at this stage, though. No production dates have been determined yet.

Co-created by George R.R. Martin and Ryan Condal, House of the Dragon is based on Fire & Blood and set 300 years before the events of GoT, telling the story of House Targaryen.

Bloys said: “They are in the room breaking story right now. My guess is we’ll see it on the air in ‘22.”

As for the untitled Game of Thrones prequel pilot starring Naomi Watts, which HBO ultimately passed on, the cancellation was characterised as no singular thing.

“Pilots — sometimes they come together, sometimes they don’t. And I would say that was very much the case here. There’s nothing I would point to and say ‘Oh, this was the problem’,” Bloys said.

He added that Jane Goldman, who co-created the project with Martin, took on the challenge of world-building “beautifully”.

“That (prequel) was 8,000 years before the current show, so it required a lot more invention. One of the benefits of House of the Dragon is there was a text from George and there was a little bit more of a roadmap.

“(Goldman’s prequel) did have more challenges in terms of establishing a world, but I think she handled that beautifully... there wasn’t one glaring thing.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/c16ddr/article30575319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/got,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/game-of-thrones-spin-off-house-of-the-dragon-will-premiere-only-in-2022/article30575320.ece

Over 400 hours of footage was shot and it took four years for the film to be put together. The voice over is by the legend, Sir David Attenborough and the original score has been composed by Grammy-awardee Ricky Kej. The film is on the grandeur of Karnataka’s stunning forests and wild life. The trailer gives a glimpse into the advanced technology used to make the film. MetroPlus caught up with Amoghavarsha on the filmmaking process. Excerpts:

A journey into the wild A still from Wild Karnataka

We see filmmakers turning to old school techniques and putting a new spin on it. Did you experiment with familiar technology to do something new?

We used a lot of new technology, such as gimbals, stabilisers and new-generation drones. But with an idea to get more intimate with the subject and to showcase a new perspective.

As filmmakers, what are some of the risks you go through, because the equipment you use is expensive...

Risk is unavoidable on field. However, with years of experience, we know the common issues or risks like weather. Also we take safety quite seriously in the field.

What did you do for the sound? While a film can be immersive with intense visuals, how did you match the sound of the film? Did you use anything new with that?

Sound is tricky. You cannot always record on field. So you have to go back at times. We used high fidelity mics and recorders

We used drones only in forest areas and under supervision of officers and field staff.

We have been in touch constantly not just with international filming teams but also broadcasters and camera companies to make our 4k future proof.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bhiht5/article30575233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bgmamoghavarshajsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/into-the-heart-of-karnatakas-forests/article30575234.ece
145,2020/01/16,Documentary 'Lakshmanrekha' sheds light on indigenous methods for preserving water,"Scarce water resources, especially freshwater ones, have been stretched to the limit in India due to growing population, industrialisation and urbanisation, among other factors. With several major metros and rural areas facing inadequate water supply, policy makers are seized of this perilous situation.

This is evident by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a people-led mass movement to conserve water using traditional methods.

Making this point precisely is the recent documentary “Lakshmanrekha”, directed by Nandan Saxena and Kavita Bahl. They have tackled sensitive and burning subjects like farmers’ suicide and tribal issues in their earlier films.

Produced by Public Service Broadcasting Trust and Films Division, the one-hour film is an intimate, cinematic window into how Lakshman Singh galvanised the Lapodia village (Dudu tehsil) near Jaipur into a voluntary force, that changed the destiny of 58 villages in the region, besides motivating hundred others. The film’s taut script and competent cinematography capturing the village, its environs, and people, its women in particular, in all its hues, is bound to keep the audience engaged.

Lakshman Singh

Way back in 2010, alarmed by the declining water table in Delhi and neighbourhood, the National Award winning director duo were directed to visit Lakshman Singh by environmentalist Anupam Mishra. “At Lapodia, we found an oasis of green in a vast swathe of burnt ochre. The three ponds were full. The fields had millets and gram. The chequerboard-like shallow rectangular depressions in the commons were brimming with fresh rainwater. We found Lakshman both knowledgeable and an interesting character,” recalls Saxena while talking about the film’s genesis.

Interestingly, Singh was inspired by the Dadasaheb Phalke awardee Manoj Kumar’s song “Mere Desh Ki Dharti…” in the film “Upkar”. Eager to make his land and country rich agriculturally, he read Gandhian Anupam Mishra’s “Aaj Bhi Khare Hain Taalaab”, which inspired him.

Finding direction

Singh, keen on getting educated hands-on, left school and led a few friends to repair the village pond. He recalls that in the beginning, people scoffed at him, but with word spreading a big force of volunteers joined. With the pond brimming with water during the rains, he was taken seriously.

Emboldened, Singh convinced the villagers to adopt and work on his innovative chequerboard, he termed as “chauka system”. This involved digging square and rectangular pits in a pattern that slows the surface runoff of rainwater, thus maximising ground water recharge.

According to Saxena, this concept of self-help was possible because “Singh in spite of his position of privilege took the hoe and the spade in his hands – to lead by example. This dismantling of the rigid feudal mores of Rajasthan by Singh encouraged the villagers to lend a shoulder. They worked on the ponds that re-charged the wells. Then they dug a canal to let the rainwater flow to the commons in the next village. Slowly, the earth turned, stretched its feet and snuggled under a green blanket.” Revering water as an invaluable gift granted by God Indra, a signboard exhorts villagers not to pollute the water bodies and preserve them.

Thus, the documentary makes a strong case for adopting indigenous solutions. “These have the backing of the people, for their native intelligence and traditional wisdom finds its stamp in these cost-effective and time-tested solutions. ‘Chauka-system' is one such example of common sense that eluded the mandarins of the irrigation department for many decades while they propagated contour-bunds regardless of their history of failure,” avers Saxena.

Domino effect

With enough fodder, farmers and pastoralists bought 'desi' Gir cows and buffaloes resulting in Lapodia and Nagar villages lead the pack of 58 villages where income from milk has changed many equations. The recharge of groundwater aquifers allowed two crops, sometimes three. “From the helplessness of waiting for government doles for drought-relief, these villages are more self-sufficient and the people walk with their heads held high,” observes Bahl. All this has significantly stemmed from the water-stressed induced migration.

Nature conservation

Success egged Singh to turn people’s attention to environment protection. He pleaded them not to cut trees and plant babool, kair, neem and khejdi while weeding out only the foreign ones to protect the local varieties. The mass scale afforestation led to the creation of what Singh termed as “dev banis” (sacred groves). “The soothing green cover over Dudu tehsil, compared to the dry, barren neighbourhood is the certificate Nature has awarded for this work. Different species of migratory and resident birds put their signature on this certificate every year,” recollects Bahl. She quips, “At Lapodia and Nagar, we woke up to the chorus of koels and pheasants every morning – a respite from the blaring horns of Delhi.” The film captures these serene moments of greenery, ponds brimming with clear water and the chirping of avians, at dawn and dusk, remarkably.

What will definitely intrigue viewers’ is the shot showing the signboard of chooha ghar, where rats are preserved. Singh, wondering why the world was after them, says, “They have been created for a purpose which is burrowing and digging, thereby allowing seeds to take root in the soil. The absence of rats will definitely impact the lives of several animals, including snakes, eagles, and cats.” Coming as it does from a school drop-out, it speaks volumes of wisdom acquired over generations by the villagers. Calling “chooha ghar”, a unique idea, Saxena says, “It is not fashionable to talk about rats or termites, and yet these are very important for any ecosystem. Singh does not shy away from being politically incorrect.”

Singh’s opposition to contour dams outraged government officials, who rubbished his ‘chauka system’. “This antagonism continued till Singh received his first award from the HRD Minister in 1992. With the National Award for Water Conservation by the President of India in 2008, his ideas found many takers,” says Bahl.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jjq2x5/article30575007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Lakshmanrekha2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/documentary-lakshmanrekha-sheds-light-on-indigenous-methods-for-preserving-water/article30575009.ece
146,2020/01/16,"10 small films in the offing, says ‘Darbar’ producer Subaskaran Allirajah","Following his production house’s latest film Darbar starring Rajinikanth, Lyca Productions chairman Subaskaran Allirajah says he will produce at least 10 small films this year.

“It doesn’t always have to be a superstar or a big director. My interest is really in good cinema,” says the Sri Lanka-born British Tamil businessman, who was in Colombo recently.

Darbar, said to be made on a budget of ₹200 crore, is “doing well”. Lyca’s earlier Rajinikanth starrer 2.0 was reportedly made with a budget of over ₹500 crore. The production house has also been associated with the distribution of films made with relatively smaller budgets, including the acclaimed Kaala and Vada Chennai. “There is no contradiction there. In fact, the logic of business demands that we back different kinds of films and that has worked well for us,” Mr. Allirajah told The Hindu atthe Taj Samudra here.

Mr. Allirajah’s wealth comes from his huge mobile network operating company in London. But his decision to put his money into films is driven by his own passion for Tamil cinema right from his student days when he says he watched “one or two films” a day.

Today, his Chennai-based production house is behind some of Kollywood’s biggest and much-anticipated projects, including Mani Ratnam’s upcoming Ponniyin Selvan — which he is co-producing with Madras Talkies — and Indian 2 starring Kamal Hassan.

Mr. Allirajah hails from Mullaitivu, in the island’s Tamil-majority Northern Province. As a teenager he fled the country to escape the war that had just begun. After spending about 10 years in Paris as a refugee, he moved to London and went on to helm Lycamobile, a mobile network company that, according to its website, is present across 22 countries with 16 million users. Asked about his intriguing journey from a refugee in Paris to a business tycoon in London, Mr. Allirajah said: “I can only say it was a good accident.”

His company is one of the largest donors to the Conservative Party and has in the past been accused of evading taxes for years. The company has denied the allegations. “I’m a business man and I back the Party because of its economic policy,” Mr. Allirajah said, insisting there was “nothing political” in his choice.

The producer was also in the news here in 2017, when Rajinikanth — who was to unveil a housing scheme in Jaffna, as part of an initiative of Mr. Allirajah’s Gnanam Foundation — cancelled his visit following strong objections raised by some Tamil Nadu politicians.

“Even here [Sri Lanka], the southern media accuses me of being an ally of the LTTE, while some Tamil media say I am close to the Rajapaksas. I really wonder: Who am I?” he said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ziak0o/article30574593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sub,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/10-small-films-in-the-offing-says-darbar-producer-subaskaran-allirajah/article30574594.ece

148,2020/01/16,How a story is told matters more than what is being said: 'Ayyappanum Koshiyum' director Sachy,"Sachy is the man of the moment. Even as Driving Licence, a movie he scripted, is setting the cash registers ringing, Sachy is busy with the post-production work of his next film as a writer-director, Ayyappanum Koshiyum, which will release soon. The lawyer-turned-writer entered Mollywood in the company of fellow-writer Sethu with movies such as Chocolate, Robin Hood, Makeup Man, Seniors and Doubles.

After the duo decided to work independently, Sachy scripted Run Baby Run, Chettayees, Ramaleela, Sherlock Toms and Driving Licence. His maiden film as a director, Anarkali, came out in 2015. Sachy talks about his work and why he feels commercial cinema is focused on entertainment in this tête-à-tête with FridayReview. Edited excerpts:

What is Ayyappanum Koshiyum about?

Although I can’t pinpoint the genre the movie falls into, the narrative is that of a mass entertainer. Prithviraj plays Koshi Kurian, a retired havildar from an influential family, living in Kattappana. Biju Menon dons the role of Ayyappan Nair, a sub-inspector on the verge of retirement. The story is set in the forests of Attappadi where an incident takes place between the two. Although I have used politics as a backdrop in Ramaleela, in Ayyappanum Koshiyum, it’s just a subtext.

Director Sachy | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

What is it in a script that makes you decide to direct the story?

I entered the film industry to become a director. Sethu and I teamed up as scenarists after our plans to direct Robin Hood did not materialise. While writing for another director, the story should suit that person’s tastes. I wanted to make my debut as a director with a movie that required some effort. Anarkali had such a plot and it was set in a different terrain. However, my next film has been written by two new writers.

After Anarkali, you are working again with Prithviraj and Biju Menon in Ayyappanum Koshiyum ...?

In Ayyappanum Koshiyum, Prithviraj and Biju Menon are protagonists and antagonists at the same time. Biju plays a character older than himself. I wanted Biju for the film as I felt he could play the role subtly. The character had to be strong and physically fit too. In Anarkali his was more of a supporting role, it was sweet of him to accept the offer.

What do you think worked in favour of Driving Licence?

Although the plot revolves around an ego trip between a superstar and his fan, their emotional ups and downs carry the story ahead. Those feelings have been balanced not just in the script, but by director Lal Jr. as well, which I feel worked in the film’s favour.

Prithviraj mentioned that he would have liked to play the fan, if Mammootty were to play the superstar in Driving Licence as per the original plan.

There were certain things in the script that Mammookka (Mammootty) was not convinced about, especially in the scenes towards the climax. He explained his reservations to me and I understood what he was saying. Now that the movie is making waves at the box office, there is no point in thinking about the past.

How does a story evolve or how do you find your story?

More than finding a story, the basic storyline might be based on an experience I have had. For instance, Driving Licence was a thought that occurred to me when a funny incident happened while I was taking my driving test. In the case of Anarkali, the climax was the first to evolve. I was stuck in Kalpeni island, Lakshadweep a few years ago when I heard about medical evacuation by air for urgent cases, which triggered the idea. And the first thought of Ayyappanum Koshiyum came as a situation between a youth and his driver.

You take long gaps in between your scripts...

I don’t consider script writing as a spontaneous art. For me, how a story is told matters more than what is being said. So I start writing only after a thought is fully developed. Some of my friends say I sit down to write only when I am done with all my travelling and partying (laughs). But the script of Chettayees was written in a short time frame and it didn’t work the way I would have liked it to.

You have mentioned that Chettayees was inspired by your gang of friends. Were you disappointed when it failed to make an impact?

The basic storyline of Chettayees is about a woman retaliating after certain situations. The focus, however, got diverted with a few scenes in the first half, which gave viewers a different vibe. The movie didn’t work that well commercially and, of course, I was disappointed.

Your body of work seems to be focussed on entertainment?

There is a huge segment of viewers who don’t go for realistic movies. My effort is to target them with entertainers.

Does your involvement as a writer depend on whether or not you are directing the movie?

When my role is just that of a scenarist, my job is mostly over once the director is convinced with the script. I prefer to leave it to the director’s creative freedom instead of getting into his space. I rarely go to the sets while the shooting is under way. When I am the director, the actual effort starts with the shooting. Obviously directing a movie gives me tremendous satisfaction.

You wrote five scripts with Sethu. What were the pluses or minuses of being part of a duo?

Even when we came together to write scripts, we had our own ideas. As both of us wanted to become directors, we decided to join hands as writers till we got a foothold in the industry and then branch off as independent filmmakers.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qy8hcp/article30566652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tvfAyyapanum,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/writer-director-sachy-on-his-creative-process-and-his-new-film-ayyappanum-koshiyum/article30566654.ece

151,2020/01/16,Six arrested for violating conditions in rooster fight in Karur,"Six persons were arrested on Thursday for showing cruelty to birds and harassing them during sevelkattu (rooster fight) events in Karur district.

The district administration had permitted the organisers to conduct the cockfights, usually held in villages during the Pongal festival, for four days, starting Wednesday, on the condition that the roosters should not be subjected to any form of harassment, and the law on prevention of cruelty to animals should be adhered to.

Veterinarians from the Animal Husbandry Department checked the cocks before allowing them into the arena. Though the organisers repeatedly made announcements on the need to “obey the rules and regulations” of the cockfight, many participants ignored them.

The cockfights were conducted simultaneously in 39 cock pits that had been established on the sprawling ground. The specially bred and conditioned combatants were made to fight it out with aggression until one of the birds was critically injured or left decapitated. Some of the birds died in the cockpit. Many of the fights lasted five to six rounds, testing the stamina of the birds.

However, following complaints of cruelty being meted out to the birds, the Aravakurichi police arrested six persons. According to police sources, the accused allegedly tied sharp knives to the legs of the cocks and made them fight against each other. At least 7 persons, including spectators, were injured when the cocks flew out of the enclosures and hit them.

The police filed two separate cases under Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, and arrested S. Rajendran, P. Ramesh, R. Vadivel, Murugesan, J. Moorthy and M. Senthilkumar of Poolanvalasu. All of them were remanded in judicial custody.

Two more cases were filed against four persons on the charge of indulging in betting on the fights.

In 2014, the rooster duels in Aravakurichi taluk were banned after two bystanders died after being injured apparently by knives tied to the legs of the birds. The events resurfaced a couple of years later, albeit with restrictions.

“Cockfight is not just a sporting pastime; it blends into our culture and tradition. I believe that if my cock wins, it will bring prosperity to my family,” said M. Leo Raj of K. Paramathi, who has been bringing his roosters to the fights for the past 15 years.

“One of the combatant cocks invariably dies or suffers critical injuries in the fight. It is hard to reconcile if well-bred and conditioned cocks die. But we take it in the right spirit as the sport symbolizes our identity,” said M. Subramanian of Alanpadi in Dindigul district.

According to rough estimates, more than 40,000 people thronged Poolanvalasu on Wednesday, the first day of the event. Nearly half of them had brought roosters. The crowd was considered unprecedented in the history of the several decades-old annual rooster fights being held in the village. The event attracted a huge turnout on Thursday too. All roads leading to Poolanvalasu were flooded with cars, vans and motorbikes as enthusiastic spectators made a beeline to witness the event.

Chairman of the District Cooperative Union Bank R. Natarajan, one of the organisers, said they had taken all necessary steps to adhere to the rules and regulations of the event.

Cocks were allowed to participate in the fights only after physical checks. Several restrictions were imposed to ensure the safety of spectators, he said.

The cockfights will continue on Friday and Saturday as well.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/zduvln/article30581368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17COCKFIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/six-arrested-for-violating-conditions-in-rooster-fight-in-karur/article30575577.ece

Vellore North Police sent his body for post-mortem at the Government Medical College Hospital in Adukkamparai. A case has been registered and police have launched a search for the assailants. They suspect that the reason for the murder could have been previous enmity.

In a memorandum submitted to the State Election Commissioner here, he also attached clippings of newspapers and videos of Mr. Owaisi’s speech at Sangareddy where he apparently asked people to seek money from the Congress party but vote for his party.

“He has also suggested that he should be given credit for the money they will receive. This is violation of the Model Code of Conduct, asking people to take bribe and treat it as his bribe,” Mr. Reddy said.

He urged State Election Commission to book a case against Mr. Owaisi and issue notice to him. “Immediate action by the SEC will send the message that it is acting impartiality and is committed to act firmly when violations take place even if the party involved is working closely with the ruling TRS party,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/shashidhar-reddy-seeks-action-against-owaisi/article30578761.ece
154,2020/01/16,"Police to use analytics to assess crowds, vehicles at Medaram jatara","For the first time in Medaram Jatara in Mulugu district, the biggest human congregation witnessed every two years in the State, police are using analytic software to predict stampede-like situations and traffic jams.

The video footage of nearly 350 surveillance cameras installed in and around Medaram Jatara venue would be sent to a server over which the analytics are run in real time. The software will help police in management of people and vehicles at the massive Jatara.

“Surveillance cameras were used earlier also. This time we are linking them with analytics software. A technical team from Hyderabad will come down to Medaram for this,” a senior police officer associated with the security arrangements for the event told The Hindu. The technical team will be available at the special command control room at the venue and help police assess movement of devotees and vehicles by analysing the video footage.

Real time analysis

“Taking density as parameter, the analytic software will help estimate number of people present in a specific area. It will also assess how many women, men, children and older people are there,” the officials said. Though precise numbers cannot be given, the analytics would surely give 80% to 90% clear figures, they said confidently.

Running the software would also assist the police in assessing behaviour of the crowd. Normally, the figure of one person per square foot is normal. But if it crosses 1.5 person per square foot, it suggests an alarming situation and hints at possible stampede-like situation, the officials said. The authorities believe the software would be of utility for them while assessing the movement of people at the queue leading to the main venue.

Pickpocket alert

A separate video wall is being set up at the command centre. Here video footage of the parking space, queue lines and main venue where people offer prayers is analysed. Interestingly, the police are planning to use facial recognition software to identify pick pockets and other offenders who try take advantage of the crowded situation.

Photos of persons indulging in pocket picking and stealing mobile phones would be integrated with the software. It will identify the offenders if they are seen in the crowds and pop up alerts.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4axrdu/article30578643.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17MEDARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/police-to-use-analytics-to-assess-crowds-vehicles-at-medaram-jatara/article30578644.ece
155,2020/01/16,BJP releases chargesheet against TRS government,"The Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday released a chargesheet against the ruling TRS government accusing it of neglecting the needs of the urban areas, starving it of funds, doing nothing to improve the civic amenities and ignoring the housing needs of the poor and the unemployed.

At a press conference at the party office and flanked by senior leaders, including N. Indrasena Reddy, N. Ramchander Rao and others, party president K. Laxman released a list of promises made by the government for the municipal areas over the years and pointed out that very few were fulfilled.

“People of Telangana have been continuously electing the TRS for the last six years in different elections. We urge people to put a break to the car’s movement in the light of their empty promises and support our party candidates in the municipal elections,” he said.

Absysmal sanitation

The BJP president charged that in the current ‘dictatorial, corrupt family rule’, basic municipal services were available only for a price with corruption at all levels. Abysmal sanitation has led to rise in viral fevers and the public health services did not see any upkeep even as opening of new dispensaries/hospitals have not seen light of the day.

The government has been focusing only on big ticket irrigation projects but even here the benefits that accrued to the farmers has been negligible. On the other hand, it has only helped lining up the pockets of the contractors and party bigwigs, he said.

“With his play of words and gift of gab, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has been fooling the people for too long. What happened to transforming our urban areas into Dallas, London and Istanbul? The capital city itself is in a pathetic state even in areas supposedly adopted by ministers and administrators, so how can we expect better facilities in other municipal areas?” he wondered.

No funds

The government’s did not have sufficient matching grants to make use of the Central government’s largesse for weaker section housing, constructing toilets and for the SMART cities scheme, he claimed and pointed out that the CM’s assurance to visit districts to personally monitor development works has never materialised.

“Each urban region was promised ₹100 crore and contract employees services were to be regularised but nothing happened,” he said. The party is also going to come up with the full fledged manifesto for the forthcoming polls.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/lw907m/article30578563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17KLAXMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-releases-chargesheet-against-trs-government/article30578564.ece

157,2020/01/16,Congress promises no municipal tax for small homes,"No municipal tax for home with a building area of less than 500 sft, new Building Regularization Scheme (BRS) and free tap connection and supply of quality water for all white ration card holders are some of the promises Congress has made if the party is voted to power in the municipalities and corporations.

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Member of Parliament from Nalgonda N. Uttam Kumar Reddy along with AICC spokesperson Dasoju Sravan unveiled the party’s manifesto for municipal elections, which he described as Vision Document for the comprehensive development of urban local bodies.

Addressing Congress party leaders and workers in a live interaction programme on social media platform Facebook on Thursday, Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said that the TRS has no right to seek votes as the State government has failed to provide drinking water in municipal areas through Mission Bhagiratha.

He reminded that Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao, in December 2014, had announced in Assembly that TRS would not seek votes if his government failed to provide drinking water through Mission Bhagiratha scheme. The scheme is a failure as people in many municipalities and municipal corporations did not get the promised safe drinking water through taps.

The TPCC chief said there was no development or even improvement of civic infrastructure in any of the urban local bodies in the last six years. He said the existing infrastructure was development during the previous Congress regimes.

Mr. Reddy said KCR had forgotten all the electoral promises made in 2014 and again in 2018 elections and appealed to the people to teach TRS a “fitting lesson” in municipal elections.

Even after completing one year in the second term, TRS government did not waive off crop loans up to ₹ 1 lakh and it had forgotten the promises of unemployment allowance of ₹ 3,016 per month, double bedroom for weaker sections, 12% reservation for Muslims and STs.

He said people must vote for the Congress party in the municipal elections if they want to bring pressure on the government to fulfil electoral promises.

He appealed to the minorities not to trust KCR as TRS has a secret alliance with the BJP and that was why KCR was reluctant to come out in open to oppose CAA, NRC and NPR. He reiterated the demand that a special session of Telangana Legislative Assembly be convened to pass a resolution rejecting CAA and NRC in Telangana.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/6aoy5t/article30578367.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy16Uttam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-promises-no-municipal-tax-for-small-homes/article30578259.ece

159,2020/01/16,KTR threatens to sack corrupt staff in ULBs,"TRS working president and Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MA&UD) Minister, K.T. Rama Rao has sent a stern message to the employees found indulging in corruption or dereliction of duty saying the government will not hesitate to dismiss outright rather than just suspending them.

Stating that the biggest challenge ahead of him as Minister was to enforce the new Municipal Act that gives the government liberty to punish officials, he said the government is serious about it to ensure people get best services.

At an interaction with media here ahead of the polls to Urban Local Bodies scheduled on January 22, the Minister said the new Act also allows the transfer of municipal officials across the State. It will unseat the corrupt and also reward the officers putting in their best. It also applies to the elected representatives of the ULBs.

Exuding confidence that TRS will win lion’s share of wards in the ULB polls, he said the government has done extremely well in all spheres to garner people’s support. He said every town is connected with the bulk supply line under Mission Bhagiratha and 90 mini tank bunds were developed.

Faecal Sludge Treatment Plants (FSTPs) will be completed by March-end in major towns, and this is the first such facility in municipalities in India, he said. Government sanctioned ₹ 50 crore for this. Apart from budgetary allocation, ₹ 2,500 crore was sanctioned for the ULBs, he said.

Moreover, all the ULBs were being sanctioned ₹ 216 crore per month, while the government is already releasing ₹339 crore for panchayats changing the face of villages. ULBs too will see a marked difference.

KTR claimed that there were no takers for B forms of the BJP and Congress in 700 and 400 plus wards respectively. “TRS is the only party which has been able to field candidates in every single division,” he said.

Unable to face the TRS, both the national parties now have come to a tacit understanding to defeat the TRS in several municipalities. They ensured transfer of votes to stronger candidates among them in Parliament elections and want to replicate the same here, he alleged.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/p92rau/article30579650.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17KTR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ktr-threatens-to-sack-corrupt-staff-in-ulbs/article30578104.ece
160,2020/01/16,Multi-cornered contests in for ULB elections in State,"The forthcoming elections to the urban local bodies is likely to witness keen contests as a total of 12,989 candidates are in the fray in nine municipal corporations and 120 municipalities that are going to polls on January 22.

Multi-cornered contests are in the offing in several of these ULBs as the three principal parties the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (2,972), the Congress (2,616) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (2,313) fielded their nominees in majority of these corporations and municipalities going to polls. The number of independents, rebels who failed to get the B form from the major political parties, is equally significant at 3,750 after the expiry of the last date for withdrawal of nominations on January 14.

Given the number of candidates in the fray after the last date of withdrawal of nominations, it will be at least four candidates per each ward in the 2727 wards of 120 municipalities and 325 divisions of the nine municipal corporations where elections are slated for January 22.

Nizamabad Municipal Corporation with 60 divisions registered the highest number of candidates in the fray at 415 followed by Ramagundam Municipal Corporation where 355 candidates are in the fray for 50 divisions that are going to polls. Adilabad Municipal Corporation with 49 divisions has 286 candidates in the fray, including 49 candidates of the TRS, 46 of the Congress, 44 of the BJP and 118 independents, while Nalgonda Municipal Corporation has 225 candidates, including 61 independents, in the fray for the 48 divisions that are going to polls.

162,2020/01/16,Jail inmates turn farmers,"Having earned a niche for themselves in producing a range of goods such as soaps, furniture and towels, thereby doing their bit in making the Prisons department self-sufficient, a few inmates of the district jail are trying their hand at farming on the sprawling open land within the jail complex at Danvaigudem.

Thanks to the initiative of the jail authorities, one and a half acre of land, which was virtually barren a few years ago, turned into a paddy field within the jail complex.

The district jail building spanning around eight acres has the capacity to accommodate 340 inmates.

Putting a portion of the open land of the prison measuring around 32 acres to productive use, the jail authorities have constructed a pond and developed a semi vegetable garden on around four and a half acres in the jail complex.

They have encouraged a group of 20 inmates of the jail to cultivate paddy last year. The attempt yielded a good harvest of 30 quintals of paddy in the last kharif season, sources said.

The trained jail inmates have turned the furniture, note book and phenyl units besides a petrol bunk being operated by the Prisons department at the jail, into profitable ventures in the past few years.

All the units together earned a profit of ₹30.93 lakh owing to good patronage from consumers, sources in the department said.

“Many inmates mainly from the rural background showed keen interest in cultivating paddy due to their natural flair for agriculture when we launched the initiative to involve the jail inmates in farming last year,” said superintendent of the District Jail, Khammam, G. Ramachandram.

They adhered to natural farming method and used organic manure in paddy cultivation. Their efforts have borne fruit as their maiden farming venture yielded nearly 30 quintals of paddy in the last kharif season, he noted.

“We have again taken up paddy cultivation on one and a half acre land to continue the endeavour to make inmates productive members of the society,” he said, adding that vegetables being grown by the inmates at the jail complex are being sold in a van at the Rythu Bazaar in Khammam.

“The vocational training and encouragement from the jail authorities will help us secure sustainable livelihoods upon our release from the prison after the jail term,” said a convict of the jail, while engrossed in the farming activity inside the jail walls.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kzlzf1/article30579675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-KHM-JAIL-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/jail-inmates-turn-farmers/article30577802.ece
163,2020/01/16,Food habits alter among Adivasis,"Adivasis of former composite Adilabad district are slowly moving away from their roots, and how. The current generation children, especially students of residential-type institutions, have developed intolerance towards food made out of indigenous grains invariably grown organically.

This phenomenon will eventually result in the aboriginal people completely giving up cultivation of their heirloom varieties of food grain which, according to nutritionists, are the best in terms of nutrition. “What is the use of growing these crops when there is no one to consume,” lamented Thodasam Hanmanth Rao, the Raj Gond tribe patel or headman of Pullara village in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district, as he talked of the changing trends in food consumption among ethnic tribes.

Adivasis used to grow different kinds of millets, the flagship variety being the persa jonna or big jowar and three varieties of rice besides a few types of vegetables as part of backyard farming. Elders swear that introduction of subsidised rice in the public distribution system (PDS) in the 1980s made the indigenous varieties seem irrelevant.

“Officials concerned told us to move away from cultivating our types of rice which, they emphasised, were of inferior quality owing to low yields and going by their ‘rough’ look,” the patel recalled the events in the 1980s when the Adivasis suffered some kind of inferiority complex growing their own crops. “The authorities compared the economic value of our crops with cotton to substantiate their contention,” he added.

“The local varieties of food grains have almost completely vanished from our kitchens and our children have grown up eating the subsidised rice supplied by the government,” pointed out Kanaka Lingubai while talking of the alienation of children from the organically grown grains. “We get stomach ache on eating the ragal perek or red rice,” observed Thodasam Anuradha, a Class XI student of Rasimetta Tribal Welfare Ashram School in the same mandal, as he summed up the intolerance for desi food among ethnic children.

The Adivasis now cultivate a few varieties of millets, sesamum and rice only to be used during religious rituals. “We are also on the verge of losing persa jonna,” rued Marsakolla Gagru, another farmer. That’s much food for thought to policy makers and agri-experts.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/c0aqjh/article30579700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-ADILA-EAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/food-habits-alter-among-adivasis/article30577524.ece

Leave alone entertainment, people are finding it difficult to make payments as most have shifted to the online payment modes, at least partly since demonetisation.

The newly introduced FASTag for smooth operations at toll plazas on national highways has taken a severe beating. Old Adilabad has two toll plazas, at Rolmamda in Neredigonda mandal in Adilabad district and at Gamjal in Nirmal district besides the newly opened toll plaza near Dilawarpur on the Nirmal-Bhainsa road.

No swipe, only cash

The plaza staff are having a difficult time explaining to truck drivers making e-paymnets through FASTag that the government has suspended internet operations because of which they need to make payment in cash. This has caused considerable delay in operations.

Further, people are finding it difficult to purchase fuel for their vehicles by making online payments. “It is difficult to find cash in ATMs to make payments during the festival season,” complained Nookala Rahul.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/suspension-of-internet-hits-citizens-in-old-undivided-adilabad-dist/article30574488.ece

Farmers, especially of Tanur and Mudhole mandals, celebrated Sankranthi by performing Lakshmi puja in their fields.

The western part of Nirmal district composed of Mudhole, Tanur, Kubeer and Kuntala mandals, which boast of Marathi cultural influence celebrate Sankranthi by performing puja to the soil and the crop. Locals call it Lakshmi puja as they draw their sustenance in the form of Dhanya Lakshmi, goddess of food grain.

Thanksgiving, indigenous style

“The puja involves worship of a food plant,” pointed out Kubre Lakshmi of Bidrelli village in Mudhole mandal who was performing puja to a jowar plant in her bengal gram field. “The offerings include poli (stuffed roti), cooked rice, carrot, sesamum seeds and raw groundnuts,” she added.

“The puja is like thanksgiving to mother nature.

169,2020/01/16,Ramayana — Valmiki and others,"It is well-known that the Ramayana is familiar to the people of many countries. The story, of course, takes on different shades. Eminent scholar and orator Dr. Rangan threw light on the variations in the epic comparing them with Valmiki Ramayana. Dr. Rangan’s talks, over nine days, were based on his 10 volume-work on the Ramayana containing verse by verse English translation of the entire epic followed by an in depth analysis of five different readings of Ramayana in different regional languages. The Navaham was hosted by WEBOLIM (http://webolim.org/contact-us/)at the Ardhanareeswarar temple, Nanganallur, Chennai, recently.

Dr. Rangan followed the timeline to underline the differences, starting from the original author Valmiki, dating back to several millennia, to the version of Tulsi (16th century). Then he went on to compare with Valmiki, the Ramayana stories written by various authors, including Kamban. Dr. Rangan stressed that Valmiki remained Adikavi, countless authors, who came later, borrowing from his rich vocabulary.

Rama-related stories reflect their own eras. For instance, Dasaratha in Valmiki Ramayana, expects the consent of people and their representatives to anoint crown Rama as the Crown Prince. In remakes, Dasaratha discusses with his Ministers or other kings or only with his priest. This shows that the era of Valmiki had more democratic elements in the administration.

When Rama begins his journey to the forest, in Valmiki’s literature, up until the end of the Kosala kingdom and a little beyond, everyone, whom he comes across recognises him. Guha, the tribal in Valmiki’s literature is already an intimate friend to Rama. But in the remakes, Rama is not familiar to many. In a few of them, Guha meets Rama for the first time during the latter’s journey into exile. Guha acts more friendly with Rama in Valmiki while he is more of a subservient friend in remakes.

On diction and style

Dr. Rangan made an emphatic statement in his ninth day talk that Rama did not desert a pregnant Sita. It was not Valmiki’s idea and he was not the author of Uttara Ramayana. The speaker cited the style and diction, which differed starkly from what one found in Valmiki’s narration. The notion of ‘human race superiority’ is absent in Valmiki’s original literature. Yuval Noah Harari in his work Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind says that in the ancient era, this notion did not exist at all. This makes us wonder whether Ramayana belongs to such an early era. Harari adds that it was only after the emergence of the notion of human race superiority in the collective psyche of sapiens, that the concept of classes/castes among humans surfaced. Classifying a particular class/caste as inferior is absolutely absent in Valmiki’s original literature, Dr. Rangan said.

The features of Manushyas, Vanaras and Rakshasas described by Valmiki correspond to Sapiens, Neanderthals and Erectus or Homo Floresiensis respectively. Valmiki’s epic might provide valuable information for researchers in anthropology, observed Dr. Rangan.

As many as 25 members of WEBOLIM (the practitioners of daily Ramayana recitation for several years) recited the whole epic in chorus.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/3avk1d/article30576455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17FRRANGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ramayana-valmiki-and-others/article30576456.ece
170,2020/01/16,"A story, less known","The first synagogue built in western India in 1796 – the Gate of Mercy Synagogue in Mumbai – has a Mysore connection. A Jewish soldier called Samaji Hasaji Divekar who belonged to the Bene Israel community was part of the Eighth Battalion of the Bombay Presidency Army that saw action in the British East India Company’s battles with Tipu Sultan. Divekar was captured by Tipu’s army in 1786, but Tipu’s mother, who was aware of Judaism, saved Hassaji’s life and ensured that he was enlisted in the Mysore army. “When he returned as a wealthy man to Bombay (now Mumbai) in 1796, Divekar built the first Jewish place of prayer in the city,” said Pushkar Sohoni, an associate professor at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune. An architectural historian by training, Sohoni was speaking at an event organised by the Bengaluru chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) on the Jewish heritage of the Deccan.

By the 18th century, when Divekar enlisted in the presidency army, Indians, and especially people living in villages in the coastal strip along the northern Konkan coast, were long aware of Judaism, as a native Jewish community known as the Bene Israel had been staying in the region for many centuries. “Community lore traces the Bene Israel’s origins in India to 2200 years ago, but we start getting documentary evidence from the tenth century onwards,” stated the affable Sohoni.

In medieval Deccan, the Jews were well integrated into village society and were known as Shanivar Telis (Saturday Oil-Pressers). They are mentioned in correspondences during the reign of Malik Ambar (1548-1626), the Habshi regent of Ahmednagar, and in the time of the Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Shivaji (1627-1680). In the 19th century, these Jews who identified themselves as members of the Bene Israel and had always been active in the military joined the armies of the East India Company.

The 18th century also saw the migration of the Baghdadi Jews (meaning Jews who lived in the Ottoman Empire) to Bombay. The Baghdadi Jews were primarily merchants and bankers and worlds apart from the native community of Jews in India. An early prominent member of this elite Jewish diaspora was David Sassoon (1792-1864) who embarked for Bombay in 1832. “He prospered as a merchant as he entered the opium trade with China which was the quickest way to make a fortune in India at that time,” said Sohoni with an excited gleam in his light eyes. “He also benefited hugely from the sale of Indian cotton in England and his sons and descendants went on to become completely anglicised and prosperous mill owners in Bombay,” Sohoni added. The contribution of this family to the urban culture of Bombay was immense as they built two synagogues and many educational institutions apart from the Sassoon Docks and the David Sassoon Library and Reading Hall.

Thus, by this time there were two distinct Jewish communities in India – the older, poorer community of Indian Jews called the Bene Israel and the more prosperous elite community of Baghdadi Jews who had transnational mercantile linkages and perceived themselves as European. (The older community of Cochin Jews was not part of this presentation). The built Jewish heritage that has been bequeathed to the north-western Deccan owes to both these communities as Sohoni explained. While the synagogues built by the Baghdadi Jews were large and are located in Mumbai, the ones built by the Bene Israel are smaller and less ostentatious and while some are found in Mumbai, are also present in villages along the north Konkan coast.

Sohoni’s presentation included a discussion of some of the prominent synagogues like the Knesset Eliyahoo Synagogue in Mumbai which was built by Sir Jacob Elias Sassoon in 1884. An ostentatious and grand building, the interiors of this synagogue are painted a calming blue and there is a stateliness to the arrangement of the pews with all of them facing the raised platform in the middle which contains the scrolls of the Torah. The Gate of Mercy Synagogue which was built in 1796 by the aforementioned Divekar is modest in comparison and its interiors, while seeming to have a spiritual gravitas, are drab. The further one goes away from Mumbai, the synagogues, which were known as ‘Israeli masjids’ become smaller and utilitarian almost as if they were drained of the life blood of commerce that fed the metropolis of Mumbai.

In his presentation which lasted for almost an hour, Sohoni discussed the architectural features of these synagogues as well as other secular structures in detail even discussing the distinctive door knobs and highly intricate woodwork that is a prominent feature of many of these Jewish prayer halls. The remnants of this Jewish built heritage shows that there was a substantial community of Jews in India and this is corroborated by census data that shows there were 14,805 Bene Israelis in 1941 and over 5000 Baghdadi Jews. This number diminished significantly after the creation of Israel in 1948, and first, the Baghdadi Jews left in droves followed by the Bene Israelis in the 1960s. Currently, there are around 4000 Bene Israel community members who still live in Mumbai and along the Konkan coast.

Sohoni’s interest in the Jewish heritage of the Deccan was sparked by his deeper interest in the architectural history of the Nizam Shahi Sultanate of Ahmednagar on which he has published a monograph. “I kept stumbling on Jewish buildings while doing my work,” he explained. Sohoni belongs to a younger generation of scholars who followed in the footsteps of legendary historians like George Michell, Richard Eaton and Phillip Wagoner, all of whom have contributed immensely in enriching our understanding of the medieval Deccan. Having studied under the mentorship of another great architectural historian, Michael Meister, Sohoni’s future research should be followed keenly.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/t8mv87/article30575863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGFRINDIA-RELIGION-JEWISH-CEMETERY-SOCIETY,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/a-story-less-known/article30575866.ece
171,2020/01/16,Home has heritage,"Taking off at a point where words start to seem like a rhetoric, the works of art at Art Park Bengaluru held at Ravindra Kalakshetra on J.C. Road, drove the message home. Art Park in its first outing of the year, chose heritage as its theme wherein the participating artists reflected on it in their distinct styles.

If artist Sudhir’s live masterful rendition of Heritage Beku took on the form of Lord Ganesha, the up and coming K. Gajanan engaged with the theme through his depicting of seasons of Bengaluru.

Shan Re evoked the happy memories of her visits to Cubbon Park through her Nocturnal Blooms series that was on display. Raviraja K. offered a picture-postcard vista of Shivaganga Hills, a popular getaway for trekking enthusiasts, in his work whereas his friend on Gangu Gowda’s watercolour landscapes in a bright palette were nothing less than a dream.

Art Park was born 2014 ago with the intention of taking art to the public. It is held on the first Sunday of every month at the Sculpture Garden of Ravindra Kalakshetra. Anybody can walk in and watch artists paint on the spot and also buy paintings.

With the preservation of heritage becoming a moot point in the last few years, Art Park collaborated with Heritage Beku, an organisation of concerned citizens advocating the cause. Around 35 artists from the city participated in Art Park.

Architects Naresh Narasimhan and Sathya Prakash Varanashi, Priya Chetty-Rajagopal of Heritage Beku, Latha Reddy, Chairperson of Deccan Heritage Foundation, artist G Jeyakumar and artist SG Vasudev, the force behind Art Park raised some pertinent points at the event.

“A lot of people ask me what’s wrong with knocking off the old. Why do you stick along to old structures, let us make new buildings. But if you do that you will not have any pride in the city.

When I ask people what is the first image that comes to your mind when I say Bangalore, young people particularly say, ‘UB City’,” said Narsimhan.

He said that building alone don’t make up heritage, Spaces, lakes, greenery also constitute living heritage. “Thinking people, artists, writers need to come together to talk about the issue because unless you sing a song, nobody is going to listen. Whatever little is left belongs to Bangalore and we have been telling the government to pass the Bengaluru Heritage Preservation and Regulation Bill soon,” added Narsimhan.

Recalling her time in Indian Foreign Service, former bureaucrat Latha Reddy said people across the world had enormous respect for our culture that made her feel so proud. “We don’t have respect for our culture, but still we need to keep making efforts to preserve our heritage.”

Highlighting the need for sustained efforts, Varanashi exhorted people to make that squirrel’s contribution to keep it going.

At the event, hand-painted calendars were also available for sale. Like every December, Art Park came out with the new year’s calendars printed on drawing sheets which are then hand-painted by the artists on the spot. The heritage-themed calendars will be available in the February edition of Art Park as well.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ksan00/article30575776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bgfrart4jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/home-has-heritage/article30575788.ece
172,2020/01/16,In harmony,"Vid R.K.Padmanabha and Pandith Nagaraja Rao Hawaldar presented a vocal jugalbandi at the 65th year celebrations of the Sri Rama Lalitha Kala Mandira. The vocal support was provided by Omkarnath Hawaldar, mridangam by C. Cheluvaraju, and tabla by Kedarnath Hawaldar, violin support to both was rendered by C.N.Chandrashekar and on harmonium was Sameer Hawaldar.

When veteran musicians like R K Padmanabha and Nagaraja Rao Hawaldar -- who are renowned as a long standing jugalbandi team of thirty five years -- the connection becomes seamlessly beautiful and evocative.

After the customary invocatory slokam, they began with an invigorating composition by Vijayadasa, a 18th century saint from Haridasa tradition - “Sadaa enna hrudayadalli vaasa maado Srihari”, followed by Purandara dasa’s “Narayana yanniro” - both created a devout mood, preparing the audience for the next musical offering, an extensive elaboration of Kamavardhini popularly known as Panthuvarali.

RK Padmanabha explained that Shubha Panthuvarali came to be called as Shiva Panthuvarali and finally Panthuvarali in which raga the trinity composed few fine compositions , he also sang out few bits of them for example. Hawaldar explained that this raga from the Poorvi Thaat, is known as a Sandhiprakasha raga as it is sung during the sunset twilight and moonrise time and has Komal rishabh, pratimadhayam and komal dhaivat. With that introduction both of them launched unto a masterpiece rendition, soulful and sublime, powerful and impacting. Breathtaking alapana, soulful taanam rendered by both the musicians created a mood of complete felicity and unity.

R.K. Padmanabha who is an adept singer of ten taanams, explained about Mayur taanam, Ghanta taanam, Ashwa taanam etc with hand gestures and facial expressions also, which was eagerly grasped and enjoyed by the enthusiastic audience.

Tyagaraja’s ‘Lalithe Sripruvruddhe’ in Kamavardhini was the main item, rendered with reverential feelings and musical authority. An image of Lalitha Devi could be visualized vividly in one’s mind with the enchanting rendition, nifty neraval and splendid swaraprastara resulting in heartfelt ganam. There were sections which were soothing, some sections were electrifying - their creative energy level was at its best.

Ample literary and artistic flair is required to render such compositions withcommand and ease. The sahityam, the word content of the compositions was clearly enunciated by both the musicians in their voices filled with pervasive vitality and vigour. All through, the individual signature style of the musicians was evident

No domination, no competition, it was a sacred confluence of two streams of music flowing with rhythm and melody. Their ingenious and engaging variations in alaapana and taanam filled the auditorium with pristine sounds.

As is deemed as one of the highlights of music concerts, the Thani avartanam by Cheluvaraju on Mridagam and Kedarnath on tabla proved to be rhythmically powerful and perfectly timed vigour and energy leaving the audience satiated with that thrilling experience.

The next delightful rendition by the musician duo was a Dasara pada, “Govinda Gopala Gopika vallabha” which they started by offering an ode to Lord Hayavadana – “Ninna dhyanada Sakthiya kodo Krishna…Hayavadana”. In their individual style, they scintillatingly sang the refrain and the Pada was filled with bhakti rasa, as an affective agent in enhancing the musical appeal.

Senior violinist C.N.Chandrasekhar could easily conform to both the styles and rendered excellent suppor.t

From both the angles of technique and aesthetics, entertainment and enlightenment, the jugalbandi by the maestros was par excellence and will be remembered for a very long time by rasikas and as a right template for future jugalbandi performances by musicians.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/hrnhk3/article30575720.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bgfjugaljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/in-harmony/article30575721.ece
173,2020/01/16,The man of model house,"At the corner of the junction of K.R. Road and Model House first street, in Basavanagudi area, during 1938-39, a house had been built in a different and unique style. It was considered as a model house. A.T andoni Rao, who built the house using innovative and progressive methods came to be known as the Man of Model House. He was the Executive Engineer of the state during the reign of Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV and had a prominent role in constructing many attractive buildings in Bengaluru and KRS Dam near Mysore.

After his retirement from the service A. Tandoni Rao bought a spacious site to build an abode for himself. Leaving enough space around, he raised a big house adopting innovative technology. Pre-cast concrete lattices were used both for compound and the main house. The roof of all the rooms were tall and that of the main hall was still at a larger height. The entrance was fitted with collapsible gate. On the top of the first floor was another smaller structure. From there, one could get a panoramic view of the city. In front of the house, on either sides of the main gate, were two trellises. In the inner space were a pair of stone benches with a sloping back to relax. The remaining open space around the building, had fruits and coconut trees in addition to flowering plants, the yield of which were used for daily worship in the house. A. Tandoni Rao was a god fearing person. So he aptly named his house as Bhakti Nilaya, the abode of devotion.

The innovative structure caught the attention of Indian Concrete Journal, a very old and prestigious journal of India, devoted to Concrete Technology. The magazine published the picture of the house with a caption, Model House. “The Maharaja was pleased that an Engineer of his government brought laurel to the state. He invited him to Mysore and honoured him. We were very proud of our father’s achievements,” says A.T. Lakshmi Devi, one of the three daughters of A. Tandoni Rao.

The street adjacent to the house came to be known as Model House Street and the surrounding area was called Model House block. Now, though in the place of the model house, an apartment is neatly built, the entrance from KR road still retains the plaque Bhakti Nilaya. one of the trellises with stone benches is also retained to symbolically represent the grandeur of the Model House.

Sir K.P. Puttanna Chetty Town Hall is one of the most prominent and elegant public buildings of the City. A. Tandoni Rao was the executive engineer who built this Poetry in Stone. The foundation stone was laid by the Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar, on March 6, 1933. The construction was completed within two and a half years. The Yuvaraja Kanteerava Narasimharaja Wadiyar inaugurated the building on September 11, 1935. During the colourful function held at the jam-packed auditorium, Dewan Sir Mirza Ismail and many other luminaries of the city were present. A. Tandoni Rao’s efforts and skill and aesthetic insight were praised and was honoured by the Yuvaraja. To add further grace to the Town Hall, to the left of the main entrance, an oval with little garden and decorative lamp posts was also built. Though they are not to be seen now, the Town Hall has been the prominent centre for public functions and other such activities.

Glass House in Lalbagh was built in 1888 by the then superintendent J. Cameron on the model of crystal palace in London. There were only three wings and the structure was built by using the materials from Mac-Farlane and Company, Glasgow, England, who had prepared the design,architecture and also supervised the construction. However, in 1935, when Rao Bahadur H.C. Javaraya was the superintendent, it was decided to build the fourth or the eastern wing. The construction work was executed by A. Tandoni Rao, using purely indigenous materials from Mysore Iron Works, Bhadravati.

Vani Vilas Hospital in Kote area is another well-known land mark of the City. The adjacent building, Victoria Hospital represents the majesty and grandeur of the British Empire where as Vanivilas hospital epitomised the rich culture and heritage, typical to old Mysore Province. The rectangular building with a big dome on the pediment of the portico and other such smaller domes on other symmetrical wings contrasted the gothic style of its neighbour. The construction of Victoria was administered by the British personnel. But, purely indigenous talent was involved in shaping this calm and composed edifice. The chief architect was S.H .Laksminarasappa, the Executive Engineer was A. Tandoni Rao and the contractor was Chinnaswamy Mudaliyar.

National High School in Basavangudi is a household name for imparting high quality education. Since it was a highly sought after institution, to accommodate more pupils, a new building was constructed in the late 1930s. The construction work was done by A. Tandoni Rao. Here again, the front elevation clearly symbolises that it is a temple of knowledge. He personally got the big clock from Poona to insert in the front tower. ‘…He used to see the tower from the top of his house, Bhakti Nilaya and felt extremely satisfied, says his youngest son Mr. A. T Srinivas.

A.Tandoni Rao was also involved in the construction of Sanskrit College building on 1st cross Chamarajapet. He has played a prominent role in establishing Vrindavana in Sripadarayara mutt in Raghavendra Colony, and Raghavnedra swamy Mutt in NR Colony. He helped N. Ananthachar to start Acharya Pathashala which has now become a well-known group of institutions of the city.

A. Tandoni Rao breathed his last in March, 1941.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/vwjp3t/article30575638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGFSURESHMOONAJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-man-of-model-house/article30575655.ece
174,2020/01/16,"My roots are working class, says Waswo X Waswo","Waswo X Waswo’s show ‘Bodies of Work’ is a celebration of ordinary people. His fourth exhibition in Kochi, it combines two series of photographs — Gauri dancers and farmers from the village of Varda, near Udaipur in Rajasthan, and friends and sadhus in Tiruvannamalai, where he worked on a photography project in 2015.

To understand Waswo’s empathy with the people in his photographs, one needs to go back to 2000 when he left the American mid-west, from where he hails, and arrived in India. In a leap of faith that India, the country and its people, would be a transformative experience, he added to his surname the multiplication symbol, X, and transformed into the American photographer in India.

One of Waswo X Waswo’s works | Photo Credit: H Vibhu

Not surrendering his American core, Waswo, through his work, speaks a language that in every inflection proclaims unambiguously his complete love for the people of this land. Inversely, it is proof of the degree of acceptance the once-upon-a-time outsider feels, which motivates him to create a life for himself here.

In 2002, when Waswo was searching for studio space, he first zeroed in on Kochi, for he fell in love with the beauty of the land although he worried the humidity might affect his ability to work. The dry conditions and the beauty of Rajasthan was his alternative, and Waswo found his studio at Varda in Udaipur.

One of Waswo X Waswo’s works

After two decades, he knows the land and its people well, not only observing their physical selves but also delving into their inner beauty. It is this deep and empathetic gaze that is evident in the 46 works on show at Gallery OED in Mattancherry, Kochi.

The Gauri Dancer series is from the annual folk dance that takes place in southern Rajasthan in late August. A retelling of the Mahabharata and of local tales, the performances are loud and musical but also strong, funny and reverent. Boys play the roles of goddesses and women, as villagers watch in mirth and curiosity.

Hence Kashu, the farm hand who helps Waswo in the studio during his free time, plays a character in Gauri and is beautifully captured on camera. There’s the farmer Ram Singh, (Ram Singh Concerned about The Weather) and the goat herder (Bakri Wali). These men and women are subjects of Waswo’s frames. “My roots are working class. Till this day, I feel comfortable with them,’ he says.

One of Waswo X Waswo’s works | Photo Credit: H Vibhu

But the narrative is not a plain telling. Waswo turns playful and enters the frames, posing alongside these men and women. He is seen in one image as a foreign gentleman with a spyglass in hand, looking disturbed by a chance encounter with Kashu.

In ‘A French Gentleman of Udaipur’, there’s Dominic, the French hotelier, holding India Poems, a book by Waswo. He sits flamboyantly poised along with Deepak, a young man exhibiting his gym-built taut torso. A palpable male love is sensed.

‘New News At The Chai Shop’, captures the panic-riddled chatter among a few young boys at a tea shop during Eid, reacting to an American bombing that has been reported on the news. “The transistor radio is playing outside the frame,” explains Waswo, implying that peace is fragile and transient.

Frozen moments

In ‘A Greeting at the Gate’, he catches the look of suspicion on a woman’s face who he is visiting for the first time. Waswo waits for the right moment, which he wishes to freeze. “I try to catch people in the studio as I have seen them in real life,” he says.

Feted photographer Abul Kalam Azad and educator-poet Ananda and his artist wife, Gayathri, find charming elucidation in the series from Tiruvannamalai.

Waswo’s works are collaborations. His miniatures, for which he is more famous, are done in conjunction with R Vijay. This series, the photographs, are enhanced by Rajesh Soni, a third generation photo hand-colourist.

Miniature art Waswo moved into miniatures in 2006 for he felt that his photographs were not capturing his entire story. The miniatures began to tell a more personal narrative. Through them, he looked at himself in a comical way, as a bumbling yet sympathetic foreigner. The miniatures that he does with R Vijay narrate the expat’s life and emotions. Waswo says, “You can imagine the character in the miniatures as making the photographs that you see in this show. My photographs and miniatures are not separated, they are inter-related.”

Another group of artists create the captivating backdrops for the photos on linen depicting Rajasthan’s landscape: forts, trees, birds and animals. Waswo’s black-and-white digital prints are then hand-coloured by Soni’s pale and delicate shades, adding that gossamer touch of sophistication.

“This show has a lot of layering, both physical and artistic. People often say my work is nostalgic, but I know I find camels and elephants on the streets of Udaipur today. This is also modern India. I’m not a documentary photographer; my works are my personal narrative. The people of Rajasthan have a spiritual quality, an inner light. They manage to be at peace even in tough times. India has a different vibe from the west. I’m often inspired by that,” says Waswo.

175,2020/01/16,"Rahul Gandhi questions PM Modi, Amit Shah on Davinder case","Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday alleged that the Union government’s decision to ask the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe arrested Jammu and Kashmir police officer Davinder Singh was an attempt to ‘silence’ him and questioned NIA chief Y.K. Modi’s track record.

“The best way to silence Terrorist DSP Davinder, is to hand the case to the NIA. The NIA is headed by another Modi, YK, who investigated the Gujarat Riots & Haren Pandya’s assassination. In YK’s care, the case is as good as dead,” he posted on Twitter.

“#WhoWantsTerroristDavinderSilenced And why??,” he added.

For three days now, Congress leaders have been alleging a larger conspiracy behind the arrest of the tainted J&K police officer and pointed out that he was the Deputy SP of the J&K police during the February 14 last Pulwama terror attack.

On Thursday, both Mr. Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra questioned the ‘silence’ of the government on the arrest.

“DSP Davindar Singh’s arrest in JK raises disturbing questions critical to India’s national security. It seems rather odd that he not only evaded detection but was entrusted with extremely sensitive duties like escorting foreign envoys to J&K under the prevailing circumstances,” tweeted Ms. Vadra.

“...Whose orders was he working under? A full investigation must be made. Helping terrorists plan attacks on India is treason,” she asked.

Mr. Gandhi too questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence over the matter and tweeted with the hashtag ‘TerroristDavinder Singh cover up’.

“Government silent on terrorist DSP Davinder Singh. Why are PM, HM and NSA silent on Davinder Singh. What was Davinder Singh’s role in Pulwama attack. How many other terrorists has he helped. Who was protecting him and why,” Mr. Gandhi posted.

“DySP Davinder Singh sheltered 3 terrorists with Indian blood on their hands at his home and was caught ferrying them to Delhi.

“The order is a mere formality... they have been asked to begin the probe and collect details,” said a senior government official. An NIA official had questioned Mr. Singh in Srinagar earlier.

The official said that the decision to dismiss Mr. Singh from service would be taken by the administration of the Union Territory of J&K and the Ministry of Home Affairs had no role to play in it.

Singh had been under J&K police surveillance for the past two months. His movements were being monitored for at least two days before the car he was travelling in with Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Babu, Rafi Rather and an advocate Irfan Shafi was intercepted at Kulgam in South Kashmir. The suspects were moving towards Jammu. On August 26, 2017, there was a terrorist attack at District Police Line in Pulwama. Singh was at the time posted there as Deputy Superintendent of Police. He received a gallantry medal from J&K police for thwarting the attack.

The official said Hizbul terrorist Naveed Babu, a resident of Shopian’s Nazneenpora, deserted the J&K police in 2017 and joined terrorists. He had decamped with four rifles from the guard room at a Food Corporation of India facility in Budgam before joining terrorists.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/weut7/article30579013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TH-DAVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nia-to-probe-davinder-case/article30579014.ece
177,2020/01/16,Dilip Ghosh re-elected West Bengal BJP chief,"West Bengal unit president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Dilip Ghosh was on Thursday re-elected as the president for the second consecutive term. Mr. Ghosh has been heading the party since 2015.

With his re-election, Mr. Ghosh, a Lok Sabha MP, is set to lead the BJP during the Assembly polls in Bengal scheduled for 2021.

After being re-elected, Mr. Ghosh addressed party leaders and said the people of the State have already selected the party as an alternative. “It is for us to pass the examination. We have to keep in mind that opportunities do not come knocking again and again,” Mr. Ghosh said. He added that the fight of the BJP in the country will be complete with an electoral victory in Bengal.

The re-election of Mr. Ghosh as Bengal BJP president was a foregone conclusion as only one nomination was submitted for the post of the State BJP president. Under Mr. Ghosh’s leadership in Bengal, the BJP won 18 out of 42 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the party’s vote share doubled to 40%. The 54-year-old BJP leader hails from Jhargram in West Bengal and was a pracharak of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) till he joined the BJP in 2014. He was appointed the BJP State president in December 2015.

While there was speculation that a section of the party was against Mr. Ghosh’s leadership style and his controversial comments, the central leadership reposed their full faith in his leadership. Union Minister Babul Supriyo, who criticised Mr. Ghosh for his recent comments on “shooting” outsiders, said that he too repose trust on Mr. Ghosh, who has managed to boost the confidence of party cadres in a relatively short time.

“We may have difference of opinion, but it does not mean that I will not congratulate him,” Mr. Supriyo said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/b22p4d/article30578887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TH-DILIP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dilip-ghosh-re-elected-west-bengal-bjp-chief/article30578888.ece
178,2020/01/16,"Nitish Kumar will lead NDA in Bihar elections, says Amit Shah","Bharatiya Janata Party president and Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday said Nitish Kumar would lead the NDA in the Assembly election in Bihar due this year.

“I want to make it clear once and for all that NDA will contest the next Assembly election in Bihar under Nitish Kumar….Lalu’s dream to become chief minister again will not be fulfilled”, said Mr. Shah, while addressing a public meeting as part of the party’s ongoing Jan Jagran Abhiyan (people’s outreach programme) on the new citizenship law, CAA, in Vaishali, near Patna.

While listing the achievements of the NDA governments in Bihar and at the Centre, Mr. Shah slammed the Opposition and the Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad. “We took Bihar from lantern age to LED age, from loot to law and order, fodder scam to protection of cows and from jungle raj to janata raj”, he said.

He also appealed to the audience to dial 88662 on their mobile phone to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked how many of them dialled the number. However, very few hands were raised.

“The new citizenship law is not for taking away anyone’s citizenship but to give citizenship to those who were persecuted and oppressed in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and seek refuge in our country”, explained Mr. Shah, while asking people, “whether we should give them citizenship or not?”. “But, the opposition Congress party, Lalu Prasad, Arvind Kerjriwal and Mamata Banerjee are opposing this…they speak the same language of Pakistan’s PM Imran Khan”, he added.

“It was the Congress government which had divided the country earlier on religious grounds…30% Hindus were living each in East (now Bangladesh) and west Pakistan but today there are only 7% Hindus in Bangladesh and 15% in Pakistan — who is responsible for this?”, asked Mr. Shah. “Lalu, Rahul and Company should answer where they have gone”, he said.

“When slogans like Bharat tere tukde honge hazaar were chanted in JNU, the Modi government sent them to jail but the Kejriwal government was opposing it…don’t you think they should be sent to jail?”, Mr. Shah asked the audience. When the new Citizenship Act came in there was communal tension in several parts of the country. “Congress party, Mamata Banerjee, Arvind Kejriwal and Co. are responsible for the communal tension over CAA”, he alleged.

The BJP chief declared that “the process of construction of a Ram temple will begin in Ayodhya within four months”. He listed the abrogation of Article 370, 35 (A) and surgical strikes in Pakistan as the government’s achievements.

Mr. Shah asked party leaders and workers to undertake a door-to-door campaign in the State and explain to people the new citizenship law and how the Opposition has been spreading rumours over it.

On Tuesday Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had come to Gaya in Bihar to remove ‘misgivings’ on CAA but protesters sent up black balloons during his speech.

179,2020/01/16,Limit time to apply under CAA: Assam,"The Assam government has requested the Union Home Ministry to impose a three-month time limit to apply under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, and not keep it “open ended”.

A government source said since the CAA rules are yet to be framed, the Assam government has asked the Centre to consider relaxing the norms and introducing a three-month period, beyond which no one could benefit under the Act.

CAA has the provision to grant citizenship to members of six undocumented minority communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who entered India before December 31, 2014. Several groups in Assam have opposed the CAA as it violates the provision of the 1985 Assam Accord that called for “detection and deportation” of all persons who entered the State from Bangladesh post March 24, 1971. The Supreme Court-monitored Assam’s National register of Citizens (NRC) published on August 31 last year, which excluded 19 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants, was a fallout of the Assam Accord.

The All-Assam Students’ Union (AASU), a signatory to the Assam Accord, had earlier said the CAA was “communal, a protector of illegal Bangladeshis and against the Constitution.”

“They [the Centre] could keep the window to apply under CAA open for a year in West Bengal, as there are more people who would benefit. In Assam, the beneficiaries are fewer, so we have requested a three-month limit,” said the source.

The CAA was passed by Parliament on December 11. MHA notified that the provisions would come into force from January 10.

The rules that will govern the Act are still under construction and yet to be notified by MHA. The Hindu had earlier reported that the MHA was deliberating whether or not Assam-specific rules can be incorporated.

Earlier, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had conveyed to Union Home Minister Amit Shah that the rules for CAA should have a clearly delineated provision for furnishing documents for proof that applicants entered India before the cut-off date of December 31, 2014.

Himanta Biswa Sarma told reporters on Thursday that the situation was under control in Assam. “There are agitations against the CAA. The government is undertaking outreach programmes to explain the provisions of the Act,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jw1z14/article30578766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TH-THGRP-HIMANTA-Biswa-sarma-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/limit-time-to-apply-under-caa-assam/article30578767.ece

“A body vest fitted with shrapnel and bar bearings, besides a huge quantity of explosive material, was recovered from the arrested persons,” Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of police V. K. Birdi said.

Police said the Jaish module, which was active in Srinagar, was behind grenade blasts in Srinagar after August 5. “Two were involved in a grenade attack to enforce a shutdown against abrogation of Article 370,” said the police officer.

Those arrested were identified as Aijaz Ahmed Sheikh, Umar Hameed Sheikh, Imtiyaz Ahmed Chikla alias Imran, Sahil Farooq Gojri and Naseer Ahmed Mir, all residents of Srinagar.

The explosives seized included 143 gelatin rods, secondary explosives, a silencer, 42 detonators, an improvised explosive device, walkie-talkie and small arms.

LeT militant held

In a separate operation, police in south Kashmir’s Awantipora arrested a militant of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).

Police said Ishfaq Ahmad Dar alias Maheed from Dangerpora-Padgampora was involved in many cases of threatening and intimidating civilians. He was also involved in providing logistic support and assistance to LeT terrorists operating in Awantipora.

Leaders released

Meanwhile, the J&K administration on January 16 released five more politicians from the sub-jail of MLA Hostel in Srinagar.

Those released included National Conference (NC) leader Salman Sagar, ex-NC MLA Altaf Kaloo, ex-NC MLC Showkat Ganai, NC leader Mukhtar Band and People Democratic Party (PDP) leader Nizam u Din Bhat.

182,2020/01/16,"34,000 Bru refugees to be settled in Tripura","Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday presided over the signing of a quadripartite pact of MHA with the State governments of Tripura, Mizoram and leaders of Bru community to permanently settle around 34,000 internally displaced people in Tripura.

Reangs or Brus are the second largest ethnic group in Mizoram. Their exodus in 1997 was spurred by violent clashes in Mamith subdivision, a Reang-dominated area, when they demanded creation of an autonomous council that was vehemently opposed by Mizo groups.

The Centre has sanctioned around ₹600 crore as a settlement package, Mr. Shah said on Thursday.

“Due to ethnic tensions in Mizoram, around 34,000 people were forced to live in sub-human conditions in tents in Tripura. No solution could be reached all these years. In 2018, an agreement was signed and a package was sanctioned, but many people did not want to go back to Mizoram. Only 328 families moved back. Due to the initiative by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, negotiations were started afresh. The displaced people will be settled in Tripura permanently,” Mr. Shah said in the presence of Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb and Mizoram CM Zoramthanga.

After the signing of the pact, Tripura CM said: “You cannot be refugees in your own country.”

Tripura’s erstwhile royal Pradyot Deb Barman, who is one of the signatories, said he would donate 35 acres of land for the purpose.

North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convener Himanta Biswa Sarma said the Brus would get voting rights in Tripura and would get “tribal status.” He said the Brus who settled in Mizoram would not have an option to come back. Around 30,000 Brus returned to Mizoram in batches.

Mr. Shah said the community members would also get a one-time assistance of ₹4 lakh as fixed deposit. “A 40/30 feet plot of land, an aid of ₹5,000/month for the next two years, free ration and ₹1.5 lakh to build houses will be given to them. The Tripura government has identified land to settle them,” Mr. Shah said.

A rehabilitation package signed in 2018 could not materialise.

Mr. Sarma said the government was aware of the paucity of land in Tripura but efforts were being made to settle the Brus in clusters. He said the funds to buy land would be jointly shared by the Centre and the State government.

“There were many Bengali families who were also affected due to the displacement of the Brus. Since the Brus came and settled in Tripura, the Bengalis had to vacate the areas. The agreement will also help them,” said Mr. Sarma.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/um4tsp/article30577544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BRU-SHAH-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/displaced-bru-tribals-from-mizoram-to-permanently-settle-in-tripura/article30577152.ece

Incidents of the attacks were “cruel and barbaric”, he said, and there was a need to stop them.

Stating that the attacks won’t be tolerated, he wrote on Twitter, “This is an extremely important step to stop acid attacks on sisters and daughters in the State..responsibility will be set in such attacks.”

‘Strict punishment’

It wasn’t enough to declare tax-free Chhapaak, a film made on acid attack survivors, he said, adding, “It is important to take firm steps as well to spread awareness to stop such incidents. We will ensure the guilty get strict punishment.”

The Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Puducherry governments had declared the Deepika Padukone-starrer tax-free ahead of its release last week.

Mr. Nath had earlier said the film, besides sending across a positive message on the survivors, was a tale based on self-confidence, struggle, hope, and the will to survive despite the pain.

184,2020/01/16,Bhosale supporters protest against Sanjay Raut over ‘proof’ comment,"Supporters of BJP leader Udayanraje Bhosale on Thursday staged a protest in western Maharashtra over Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s comment that the former give proof that he is a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.

Mr. Raut and Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad came under attack from Mr. Bhosale’s supporters for stating that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar is the ‘Janata Raja’ (enlightened king), a title generally used for the legendary Maratha warrior king.

The angry supporters tied placards bearing names of Mr. Raut and Mr. Awhad, an NCP minister, in the necks of two donkeys as they raised slogans against the two leaders.

On Wednesday, Mr. Raut had said, “Bhosale should give proof that he is a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji,” and asserted that no one has ownership rights over the Maratha warrior king.

Mr. Bhosale, a former NCP leader, on Tuesday maintained that Chhatrapati Shivaji alone was the ‘Janata Raja’ as he took a veiled dig at Mr. Pawar.

The former Satara Lok Sabha MP’s comments came in the wake of controversy over a book comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the 17th century Maratha warrior king, a highly revered figure in Maharashtra.

185,2020/01/16,AASU to work on new Assam party soon,"The All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) has announced that it would start working on a new political party in about a month’s time.

The union, spearheading a movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), since December 9 last, had made a New Year resolution to form a political alternative to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its regional ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) as well as the Congress.

The AGP had ironically evolved from the AASU and other organisations that had steered the Assam Agitation from 1979-1985 for ejecting illegal migrants from Assam. That agitation ended with the signing of the Assam Accord on August 15, 1985.

“We are keen on taking steps to initiate the new political alternative from February,” AASU president Dipanka K. Nath told newspersons on Thursday, almost 24 hours after copies of the CAA were burned in Bhogali or Magh Bihu bonfires.

Effigy burnt

A 13-headed effigy symbolising Ravana, the demon king in the epic Ramayana, was also burned on Wednesday to coincide with the customary burning of meji during the Bihu.

Photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and other BJP and AGP leaders were pasted on the heads of the Ravana effigy in eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh.

According to the AASU, the AGP has ceased to represent the people of Assam by “toeing the Hindutva line” of the BJP. Many AASU leaders, such as Mr. Sonowal, have switched over to the BJP during the past two decades.

“A majority of the people of Assam are against the CAA and are disgusted with how the BJP-led Assam government has let New Delhi push its divisive agenda in the State. Our intellectuals and artistes have been encouraging us to go for the political alternative to defeat this agenda,” Mr. Nath said.

‘Feeling the heat’

On Thursday afternoon, former Chief Minister and veteran Congress leader Tarun Gogoi wondered if Mr. Sonowal was feeling the heat of the fire that turned the effigy of Ravana representing him and other BJP leaders to ashes.

“The Ravana was burned near Mr. Sonowal’s ancestral home in Dibrugarh. Like that effigy, there are many real-life Ravanas, including those of the AGP, that need slaying in Assam,” Mr. Gogoi said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2mw5k/article30576871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI1112020000151A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aasu-to-work-on-new-assam-party-soon/article30576872.ece

Mr. Prasad, who is currently undergoing treatment at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), came out from the paying ward of the hospital amid tight security, and went to appear before the court of CBI special judge S.K. Sashi.

Party MLA and close aide Bhola Yadav helped Mr. Prasad on his way to the court. Mr. Prasad, said sources, has to record his statement in response to three dozen questions.

The ₹950-crore fodder scam is related to fraudulent withdrawal of public fund meant for cattle fodder from different government treasuries in undivided Bihar during the 1990s. Probing the scam, the CBI had registered as many as 53 separate cases in it.

Mr. Prasad is convicted in four fodder scam cases and is serving jail sentences of different periods. He is lodged in Ranchi’s Birsa Munda jail since December 23, 2017. However, after spending over two months in jail he was shifted to RIMS in March 2018 when he developed some health complications.

“Mr. Prasad is suffering from as many 15 diseases but his uncontrolled diabetes with dependence on insulin and chronic kidney problem has been major concerns,” said senior doctor of RIMS, D.K. Jha.

Mr. Prasad got bail last year in one of these cases on the ground that he has already served half of the 3.5 years imprisonment awarded to him.

The fodder scam case involving fraudulent withdrawal of ₹139 crore from Doranda treasury in Ranchi involves 180 accused persons and has the highest number of prosecution witnesses of 585. Of the 180 accused, 67 died during trial and currently 113, including Mr. Prasad, are facing trial.

“Barring two-three, statement of almost all 113 accused persons facing trial in the case has been recorded under section 313 of the code of criminal procedure and the case will now be concluded in next two-three months”, Prabhat Kumar, Mr. Prasad’s lawyer, told journalists in Ranchi.

189,2020/01/16,"1,496 firms in Aurangabad under scanner for pollution","As many as 1,496 companies in Aurangabad district have come under scanner of the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) for emitting high level of pollutants, an official said.

The MIDC has issued a circular saying these companies will have to bring down their emissions to the prescribed levels if they wish to expand their businesses, he said.

As per the list of 100 highly polluted areas (2017-18) in the country, Aurangabad falls in the severely polluted category with a Comprehensive Environmental Pollution Index (CEPI) score of 69.85.

As many as 1,496 companies in the district, located in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, fall under red and orange categories of the pollution index, with scores of more than 60 and 41 respectively, according to the MIDC circular.

“The notification from MIDC CEO’s office on January 2 states that expansion of companies which are already in red and orange categories have come under the scanner. These firms need to follow the norms strictly and bring down their pollution levels to prescribed limits if they want to expand their industry,” MIDC executive engineer Bhushan Harshe said.

The Central Pollution Control Board has identified 100 most polluted areas across the country and classified them in different categories based on their CEPI score.

Based on this data, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change has issued guidelines to states to curb pollution in these areas.

A total of 4,765 companies in Aurangabad are being monitored by the pollution department. Of these, 867 are in the red category and 629 in orange category (total 1,496), an official in the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board said.

Besides, 3,234 companies fall in the green category (having CEPI score of 21 to 40), and 35 are under the white category (with CEPI score upto 20). Companies under green and white categories are practically non-polluting.

Meanwhile, Marathwada Environmental Care Cluster (MECC) founder president and local industrialist B.S. Khose questioned the method of sampling of this report.

“Companies that are discharging untreated or treated effluents not in prescribed format should be identified and penalised. The other companies which are manufacturing same products but not polluting the environment, should not be held responsible for the pollution,” he said.

MECC is an independent body formed by various industries in the region to tackle pollution issues.

192,2020/01/16,"Ravana debuts in Assam’s Magh Bihu, courtesy CAA","Magh Bihu has never had anything to do with Ramayana.

But the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), has made Ravana, one of the main characters in the epic, make a debut in Assam’s post-harvest festival of feasting.

The All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), which has been spearheading the anti-CAA movement since December 9 last year, burned a 50 ft effigy made of bamboo, cane and hay in eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh on Wednesday morning.

The burning of the effigy with 13 heads was an aberration in a festive custom where bhelaghars -- temporary structures made for Uruka, the night before the Bihu -- are set on fire to appease Agni, the god of fire.

The effigy was symbolic of Ravana, local AASU leaders said. The main head sported a portrait of Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.

The others carried photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, and leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party and ally Asom Gana Parishad. On the effigy's torso was pasted the photo of BJP's national general secretary Ram Madhav.

Copies of the CAA were burned along with the effigy as well as with bhelaghars elsewhere in Assam.

“We hope the evil unleashed by a jaatidhwangshi (race-destroying) Act is turned to ashes like this Ravana that has evolved from the mythological to the political,” said P. Mahanta, a local AASU leader.

Leaders of the anti-CAA movement have been targeting Mr Sonowal for ""betraying the Assamese people"" by not resisting the Modi government's ""plan to dump non-Muslim Bangladeshis on Assam"". More than a decade ago, he was hailed as a jatiya nayak, meaning national hero, for having the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act of 1983 scrapped.

The CAA fast-tracks the process of granting citizenship to six non-Muslim communities who took shelter in India after allegedly fleeing religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Refugees or ""illegal migrants"" are usually referred to as Bangladeshis in Assam.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/b3ef1r/article30573208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ravana-CAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ravana-debuts-in-assams-magh-bihu-courtesy-caa/article30573209.ece
193,2020/01/16,Ravinder Raina re-elected J&K BJP president,"Ravinder Raina was on January 15 reelected the Jammu and Kashmir BJP president at the party headquarters here.

He was re-elected in the presence of party election observers Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan and BJP National Secretary Tarun Chugh.

Senior party leaders Varinderjit Singh and Munish Sharma were entrusted with the responsibility of supervising the organisational elections in the state.

“Morale of the party workers has remained high under the dynamic leadership of Ravinder Raina,” Mr. Vardhan said as he extended his greetings to him on behalf of the central leadership.

The Union minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set an example of selfless work for the nation and Home Minister Amit Shah has set new benchmark for organisational work.

Now, the onus of development of J&K lies with Mr. Raina, he said, assuring him the support of all central ministers in development works.

Mr. Chugh said the party is committed to finish terrorism from J&K.

“Certain mainstream politicians bring bad name to the nation by speaking for anti-India elements and Pakistan. But, we assure the public of India that we will expose every such person,” he said.

194,2020/01/16,Anwesha Das’s varnam was packed with emotion,"The Tiruppugazh ‘Eru mayil eri vilayadum’ sung to the rhythmic refrains of the Alarippu was given an vibrant interpretation by young dancer Anwesha Das, who captured the myriad colours and movements of a peacock in her introductory song at the Music Academy dance festival.

The dancer chose the beautiful ragamalika varnam composed by Dandayudhapani Pillai, ‘Swamiyai azhaithodi vaa sakhiye’, wherein the heroine cajoles and pleads with her confidante to go and fetch her Lord. The portrayal of the various musical instruments played in the procession, the movements of the dancing girls and the resplendent image of her Lord on the palanquin brought alive the grandeur of the procession, before establishing that it is Lord Siva, who rides on the palanquin, the one tormenting her.

Lengthy theermanam

The theermanam that followed was so long that the one almost forgot the theme of the piece. Thankfully, the subsequent jathikorvais in varied nadais were brief and the dancer impressed with clarity of footwork and graceful movements. The snake post at the end of each swara passage in the charanam was an interesting touch — relating to the hero of the song.

The richness of the musical score with ragas like Vasantha, Bhairavi, Saranga, Kanada and Arabhi and the poetic lyrics gave scope for imaginative explorations. The sancharis used by the dancer to show river, sky, flora and fauna to highlight the bounty of nature for the line ‘Thamadham eno vasantha’ was an engrossing study in contrast what with her mind troubled by the separation.

The varied descriptions of Siva and the emotions of desperation, anticipation and expectation came through effectively to capture the mood of the heroine in the varnam.

The Begada raga Subburama Aiyar padam, ‘Yarukkagilum bhayama’, showing a heroine who is proud of her fortune and association with her Dorai and the Periaswamy Thooran padam, ‘Thottu Thottu Pesugiran’, depicting an innocent maid being teased by Krishna and her mixed feelings for him, were the two types of nayikas chosen for abhinaya and Anwesha's depiction sustained interest.

The popular Oothukadu Kalinga Nardana thillana that was taken up did not have the necessary impact as the struggle between Krishna and the snake was not captured in a powerful manner. Anwesha's performance was a testimony to her talent, but she is at a stage when she needs to explore and charter her own path of self discovery and evolve a signature style.

195,2020/01/16,Still a work in progress,"The dancing couple Gopukiran Sadasivan, disciple of Mythili and Girija Chandran and Shantha and Dhananjayan, and Ashin Kiran, a Kalakshetra alumnus and a disciple of the Dhananjayans, are striving to establish their identity; they also run a Bharatanatyam school ‘Kiran’s Academy of Natya.’ Their concise Margam contained a sloka on Rama (‘Surya vamsha tilaka’ written by Gopukiran, Kharaharapriya), padavarnam (‘Rama neeve na rakshaku’, Kharaharapriya, Thenmadam Narasimhachari, visualised by Shantha and Dhananjayan), Rama-Sita samvadam (Sita part written by Sudarsan Srinivasan, Rama’s rejoinder by Dr. S. Raguraman, tuned by Udupi Srinath in Ahir Bhairav and Madhuvanthi respectively) and a thillana (Ritigowla, Adi, Rijesh Gopalakrishnan, sahitya by Gopukiran).

It was a well-rehearsed show, marked by a high level of coordination. The duo’s talent and sound training showed in their well-timed nritta and easy mime. However, they look like they are yet to mature as a performing pair. Bharatanatyam is essentially a solo art form and needs sensitive adaptation for a duo. For example, during the varnam pallavi, ‘Kamakoti sundaraakaara’ when the dancers take turns at describing Rama’s beauty, one felt the involvement came down when Ashin looked at Gopukiran during his turn, without mirroring his sentiments, here, admiration of Rama, or looking at the deity in question.

The varnam on the whole was a riot of rhythm and melody, each jostling for attention. The jathis were beautiful but the dancers need to be more agile and work more on araimandi.

The pair performed a contemporary take on the Ramayana, a conversation between Rama and Sita in Ayodhya, a sort of ‘tu-tu-main-main’ blame game. Sita is the aggrieved party and blames Rama for not looking after her properly in the forest, enabling Ravana’s abduction, and for allowing others to doubt her chastity and allowing the ‘agni pariksha’ when they subsequently re-unite. Rama refuses to accept the blame and accuses Seetha of accompanying him to the forest despite his wishes and asking him to capture the golden deer when Lakshmana offered to. Both dancers were expressive and involved, especially Ashin’s breakdown when Rama counters her accusations was sensitive. Yet one felt that this two-way conversation removed artistic suggestion, the bedrock of Bharatanatyam. That’s a point to mull over.

The performance was buoyed by the individual contribution of supporting artistes — calm guide Balakrishnan (nattuvangam), Udupi Srinath (vocal) who was most inspiring, the committed Keshavan (mridangam), the melodious Sujith Naik (flute) and the tuneful Sikhamani (violin).",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/bhfmhc/article30576012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17FRKIRANS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/still-a-work-in-progress/article30576013.ece
196,2020/01/16,‘Superfan’ Charulata Patel no more,"Charulata Patel, the octogenarian ‘Superfan’ of the Indian cricket team whose exuberant support prompted skipper Virat Kohli and his deputy Rohit Sharma to seek her blessings during the World Cup in England, has died due to age-related ailments.

The 87-year-old passed away on Monday, a post on her Instagram page, ‘Cricket Daadi’, stated. “With a heavy heart, I inform you that our beautiful grandmother took her last breath on January 13th at 5:30 pm,” the post read.

“She was such a cute little lady, it is true that small things come in small packages. Our dadi was a pleasure, it was / is really exceptional. It was our world. I want to thank you all for making you feel special last year. She loved the attention.”

“#TeamIndia’s Superfan Charulata Patel ji will always remain in our hearts and her passion for the game will keep motivating us. May her soul rest in peace,” tweeted BCCI.

The wheelchair-bound Charulata came to limelight when she was seen cheering for India by blowing a vuvuzela during a World Cup game against Bangladesh on July 2 last year in Birmingham.

Her enthusiasm prompted Kohli and Rohit to personally thank her and the two showed their gratitude by seeking her blessings after India’s win.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) also posted a message on its official Twitter page to condole her death.

197,2020/01/16,ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup | Runaway favourite India ready for ‘High Five’,"A few precocious talents, hardworking teenagers and a chunky lot which might fall by the wayside in times to come will form an eclectic 16-team mix in the melting pot called ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup starting on Friday.

Defending champion India will be the overwhelming favourite to win the junior global meet for the fifth time with at least six players, including skipper Priyam Garg having played senior cricket — First Class, List-A or T20. Four players — Garg, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ravi Bishnoi, Kartik Tyagi — have already landed fat contracts in the IPL.

Team to beat

India has been the team to beat on the junior circuit since Virat Kohli’s men dominated the proceedings in the 2008 edition.

While there will be future stars in Pakistan, Australia, England and New Zealand, the presence of Japan and Nigeria will certainly have its own curiosity value.

Japan is clubbed with India, New Zealand and Sri Lanka in Group D.

The Japanese team has mostly South Asian expats with names like Tushar Chaturvedi, Yugandhar Retharekar, Ishan Fartyal and Debasish Sahoo helping out the likes of Kazumasha Takahashi, Masato Morita and Shu Noguchi.

Local flavour

Nigeria, which is clubbed with Australia, West Indies and England, has more local flavour in the presence of Sylvester Okpe, Oche Boniface, Ifeanyichukwu Uboh and Olayinka Olaleye.

The tournament starts with South Africa taking on Afghanistan in Kimberley on Friday, followed by Australia’s big-ticket game against West Indies on Saturday.

Australia, like India, has a number of players who have already played senior level cricket with one prominent name being Ian Harvey’s nephew McKenzhie Harvey, who has played 2 List-A and 13 T20 games.

Similarly, England has Ben Charlesworth, who has appeared in 11 First Class games while a few of his teammates have also played for their respective counties.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/8ppjrd/article30578881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17U19,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-under-19-cricket-world-cup-runaway-favourite-india-ready-for-high-five/article30578882.ece
198,2020/01/16,Ind vs Aus | Zampa finds Kohli’s Achilles heel,"There is more to Adam Zampa than his six-wicket haul in the Indian Premier League. The Australia leg-break bowler has been one of the most consistent wicket-taking bowlers in white-ball cricket, especially in ODIs. It is reflected in the fact that he dismissed Virat Kohli for the fourth time in 11 innings at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday, which was one of the turning points of the series-opener.

Zampa on the eve of the second ODI admitted that Australia finds Kohli vulnerable against leggies at the start of the innings. “We basically just find that Virat finds leg-spinners hard to line up early in his innings, to be honest. He’s such a great starter, even the other day he was 16 off 14 or whatever it was; how much energy he brought to the crease, his running between the wickets, some of the cover drives he played off the quicks,” Zampa said on Thursday.

Gameplan

“I think it’s important to try and have a gameplan for him. So we figured that for the last game it would be good to start with leg-spin to him. It might be different next game. As it’s been mentioned, I’ve got him out four times in the last year or so. It’s nice to have that confidence to bowl to him at the start of his innings.”

Even before the start of the series, Kohli had praised Zampa for his character during Australia’s five-match series in India last year. Terming it as a “big compliment” Zampa stressed he is “not the most skillful leg-spinner in the world, that’s for sure”. “One of the most important things I have always tried to do is have a strong character. To be a wrist-spinner in one-day cricket in the middle overs is not easy at all. It’s probably one of the hardest formats,” he added.

Staging a comeback

India has its back to the wall but middle-order batsman Shreyas Iyer said the team believes in staging a comeback, like it did against West Indies last month.

“We have seen that in the past as well, we were 0-1 down against the West Indies. Its not as if we have lost the series. We can still come back strong and that’s what we discussed in the dressing room,” Shreyas said.

“We need to back and believe in ourselves and also in our teammates that in a pressure situation somebody will stand up and see the team through. We didn’t do well that well in all three departments. We need to work on a lot of areas.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mc73cp/article30577931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17AUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/zampa-finds-kohlis-achilles-heal/article30577932.ece
199,2020/01/16,India vs Australia 2nd ODI | Hosts have their back to the wall again,"If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

The idiom fits perfectly describing India captain Virat Kohli switching his batting position from No. 3 to No. 4. In order to accommodate all three specialist openers in the team, Kohli demoted himself from his favourite — and most successful — batting position. And the move backfired in the series-opener in Mumbai on Tuesday as not only did Kohli not fire but India also ended up putting on a below-par total.

With Aaron Finch and David Warner helping Australia cruise to a 10-wicket win, India for the second time in as many months finds itself needing to bounce back in a three-match ODI series. If Kohli’s cavaliers have to show the resilience they showed against West Indies last month, it’s time the captain regains his customary position.

Kohli’s admission

Kohli — who has scored 36 of his 43 ODI hundreds at No. 3 — admitted after the loss at Wankhede that India had to “rethink” about the batting order. “We’ve had this discussion many times in the past. Because of the way K.L. (Rahul) has been batting, we have tried to fit him in the batting line-up,” Kohli said. “Having said that, I don’t think it’s quite gone our way whenever I’ve batted No. 4 so we’ll probably have to rethink about that one.”

Come Friday and India’s quandary over the batting line-up will still continue, considering Rishabh Pant’s unavailability for the game. The wicketkeeper has been ruled out of the must-win game after being hit on the helmet. As a result, Rahul — who donned the gloves during Australia’s chase — is set to continue behind the wicket. It will thus be interesting to see if Kohli and Rahul swap batting positions. Pant’s injury also means that it will be a toss-up between Manish Pandey and Kedar Jadhav at the No. 6 slot.

High on confidence

Australia, meanwhile, will enter the game high on confidence. Century makers Warner and Finch will hope to give yet another cracking start to the visiting outfit on yet another belter at the Saurashtra Cricket Association stadium at Khanderi.

That the opening duo was never separated at Wankhede meant Marnus Labuschagne was deprived of having a hit in his much-anticipated ODI debut. The in-form batsman will be looking forward to prove his mettle in the shorter version on Friday.

It remains to be seen if Australia brings on Josh Hazlewood in place of Kane Richardson as the third seamer. Considering that Williamson fared pretty well at Wankhede, it is unlikely that coach Justin Langer will tinker with the winning combination for the sake of it.

200,2020/01/16,A remarkable turnaround in Australia’s fortunes,"Australia had an eventful, often turbulent 2018, marked by all kinds of leadership-related turmoil, both on and off the field. Earl Eddings, Cricket Australia (CA) chairman, has since overseen a remarkable turnaround in Australia’s fortunes. Sportstar sat down with him in Mumbai to review the past 18 months.

Australia’s transition from a team in turmoil to a formidable opponent again has been seamless. What changed?

There were challenges we went through 18 months ago but underneath all of it, this was still a very good side. We probably weren’t playing the way we wanted to. The big change was having Justin (Langer) as coach: he brings very strong values to the team, having a great captain like Tim Paine stand up. He was out of the system for a while and didn’t have the chance to lead Australia earlier because of a finger injury (in 2010). And the players, more importantly, have just fallen into their roles as custodians of the game. It’s an exciting bunch of young men who realise that ‘yes, we got to play hard but also need to uphold the spirit of cricket’ and the realisation has reflected in our performance in the past year.

Has the ball-tampering scandal changed how CA is run?

I think we just had the right people at the right spot. These people are doing the right things at the right time; this isn’t to say the predecessors weren’t but when you endure a crisis like that (ball-tampering), it galvanises everyone to work as a team. Bringing in Kevin Roberts as the CEO has been fantastic for the organisation and the sport. It has allowed us to get the focus back on cricket and make common-sense decisions about our roles within the organisation.

In retrospect, did CA handle the Newlands incident as best as it could?

I would we rather look forward to the future instead of harking back to the past but having said that, we managed as well as we could in the circumstances given the outpouring of grief not just in Australia but worldwide. As a Board, we understood we had to take some drastic measures, so we got an independent panel (by Simon Longstaff and Rick McCosker) to review our culture which led to several different changes. What other countries want to do is up to them... we expect certain standards of conduct from our cricketers. It was also unfortunate that the players had six months off, so a six-month ban wouldn’t have made anything. We were conscious of that too. Interestingly, immediately after that the ICC too increased its ban. That showed that cricket around the world expected more and that’s the standard Australia sets.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a-remarkable-turnaround-in-australias-fortunes/article30577605.ece
201,2020/01/16,No central contract for Dhoni,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni is most prominent omission from BCCI’s central contracts list for 2019-2020 released on Thursday.

His exclusion from the list of cricketers with an annual retainer is yet another indication that perhaps the three-time ICC trophy-winning captain may not don the India Blues again.

The contracts for the October-September cycle are awarded by a three-member committee consisting of the BCCI president, secretary and chief selector based on the performance during the last cycle. Dhoni hasn’t played competitive cricket since India’s World Cup semifinal exit.

While chief selector M.S.K. Prasad has said the selection committee has decided to “look beyond” Dhoni, head coach Ravi Shastri has maintained Dhoni may come back into the T20 World Cup contention based on how he fares for Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.

The man himself, however, has maintained a conspicuous silence. Last month, at a promotional event in Mumbai, Dhoni had said he would not say anything till January.

In and out

Besides Dhoni, who was placed in Grade-A last year with a contract worth ₹5 crore, three other cricketers — Dinesh Karthik, Ambati Rayudu and Khaleel Ahmed have also been excluded.

The new entrants in the 27-player list include Navdeep Saini, Deepak Chahar, Shardul Thakur, Shreyas Iyer and Washington Sundar.

Mithali downgraded

Mithali Raj, who has announced her retirement from T20Is, has been moved from Grade-A to B in the women’s contracts for 2019-20. Shafali Verma, 15, has become the youngest to be awarded the annual retainer.

202,2020/01/16,"Bhuvneshwar undergoes surgery in London, rehab in NCA","Injury-plagued Indian pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar has undergone a sports hernia surgery in London and will begin his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) after returning to the country, the BCCI said on Thursday.

The Board, however, did not specify any timeline for his recovery.

“Fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar travelled to London on 9th January and underwent a successful sports hernia surgery on 11th January. He was assisted by Team India physiotherapist Yogesh Parmar,” read a statement from Board Secretary Jay Shah.

“Bhuvneshwar will now return to India and commence his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru,” it added.

He was not named in the T20 squad for the upcoming tour of New Zealand due to the injury.

The 29-year-old, who has played 21 Tests, 114 ODIs and 43 T20Is for India, missed the home ODI series against the West Indies days after returning to action against the same opposition in the T20 format.

Also, as reported by PTI on Wednesday, the BCCI said young batsman Prithvi Shaw has left for New Zealand to join the India A team after completing his rehabilitation for a shoulder injury.

“Opening batsman Prithvi Shaw has completed his rehab at the NCA and has recovered from his left shoulder injury. He has been made available for selection for all formats of the game. Prithvi has left for New Zealand and will soon join India A,” the Board statement read.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rgy5j1/article30574356.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BHUVNESHWARKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bhuvneshwar-undergoes-surgery-in-london-rehab-in-nca/article30574357.ece
203,2020/01/16,2nd ODI: Kohli to be back at No.3 after all-openers-on-board strategy backfires,"Skipper Virat Kohli is set to be back at his regular number three position after the strategy of coming two-down boomeranged in the lung-opener as India take on a resolute Australia in the must-win second ODI here on Friday.

India go into the game 0-1 down after Australia registered a 10-wicket win in the lung-opener at Mumbai, courtesy David Warner and Aaron Finch, who hit unbeaten hundreds.

In a bid to field all three in-form players — Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and KL Rahul — Kohli dropped himself down the order but the plan backfired spectacularly as he was unable to convert his start.

Opener Dhawan later said he was ready to bat at number three if asked to by the team management, but since Kohli has been successful at that position, the skipper would be more than willing to walk in one-down.

Kohli batting at three also provides stability to the middle-order.

With a concussed Rishabh Pant out of the second game, Rahul is a certainty as he will keep wickets.

So, like in the last game, Rohit and Dhawan, who made a dogged 74 off 91 balls in Wankhede, could open, and there could be a toss-up between Rahul and young Shreyas Iyer at number four. Iyer had a rare failure on Tuesday.

Pant’s absence could pave the way for the inclusion of Karnataka batsman Manish Pandey, who made optimum use of the opportunity that he got in the third T20 against Sri Lanka in Pune.

It would also be interesting to see which among the experienced Kedar Jadhav and rookie Shivam Dube makes the squad.

Rohit, who had a phenomenal 2019, failed in the first game, but given the form he is in, the opener is expected to bounce back strongly here.

Ditto for Kohli, who is just one hundred short of equalling cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar’s record of most hundreds on home soil for India.

The bowlers led by Jasprit Bumrah had a forgettable outing at the Wankhede and they would be more than eager to make a strong comeback and prove their mettle.

Bumrah, since his comeback, has not been as effective as earlier and he would like to change the perception.

It would be interesting to see whether India play Delhi speedster Navdeep Saini or persist with Shardul Thakur, who gave away 43 runs in Mumbai.

Ravindra Jadeja looks a certainty and so the choice would be between chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, who conceded 55 runs in the first ODI and Yuzvendra Chahal as the lead spinner.

On the other hand, a high on confidence Australia will be looking to seal the issue to register back to back series wins in India, a rare feat for any visiting team. The Finch-Warner combination will look forward to carry the momentum.

Their middle-order comprising the experienced Steve Smith, in-form Marnus Labuschange, Ashton Turner and Alex Carey looks more or less settled.

If all of them fire in unison, along with the openers, then it will hard for the opposition bowlers.

However, it will be quite a test of their middle-order at the Saurashtra Cricket Association stadium.

Australian bowlers also showed at the Wankhede, why they are considered among the best.

Led by pace spearhead Mitchell Starc, they bundled out India for a sub-par 255 and Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins would be raring to go once again.

Spinners Adam Zampa and Ashton Agar, not only contained the runs, but provided crucial breakthroughs and are expected to play a similar role again in the middle overs.

The track here is expected to be a belter and India can draw confidence from the home series against New Zealand in 2017, when they won 2-1 after losing the opener, co-incidentally in Mumbai.

Squads:

India: Virat Kohli (Captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, K L Rahul (wicketkeeper), Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur and Mohammed Shami.

Australia: Aaron Finch (Captain), Alex Carey (Wicket-keeper), Patrick Cummins, Sean Abbott, Ashton Agar, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschange, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Ashton Turner, David Warner and Adam Zampa.

204,2020/01/16,India vs New Zealand T20Is | Injury-hit Black Caps recall Hamish Bennett,"Hamish Bennett has been recalled to New Zealand's squad for the first time in almost three years for the five-match Twenty20 series against India due to injuries to Trent Boult, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson.

The 32-year-old Bennett has not played for New Zealand since a one-day international against Bangladesh in 2017. He has yet to play a Twenty20 international.

Boult (hand), Henry (thumb) and Ferguson (calf) were all injured in New Zealand's 3-0 test series loss to Australia.

“We're delighted to have Hamish back in the fold for what will be a huge series against India,” selector Gavin Larsen said in a statement on Thursday.

“We all know he brings good pace and bounce but it's the clever variations he's added that make him such a well-rounded T20 bowler.”

Captain Kane Williamson returns to the Twenty20 squad after he missed the series against England in November because of a hip injury while batsman Tom Bruce and all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme will share the series.

De Grandhomme will play the first two games in Auckland and third in Hamilton, with Bruce available for the matches in Wellington and Mt. Maunganui.

All-rounder Jimmy Neesham, who suffered a thigh injury in domestic Twenty20 matches, has also missed out on the squad but has been named in a New Zealand A side to play India A in three one-day matches.

The first match of the Twenty20 series is at Eden Park on Jan. 24, with the final game in Mt. Maunganui on Feb. 2 before a three-match one-day series and two tests.

205,2020/01/16,Renovation of parks to be completed within three months,"Development works being carried out at V.O. Chidambaranar Park (VOC Park) and the Children’s Park at a total cost of ₹6.42 crore are expected to be completed in another three months after which it will be opened for public.

The V.O.C. Park, established in 1920s, is spread across 25 acre and the Children’s Park, located adjacent to it, is spread across over two acres and is located near the bus stand. These two parks, owned by the corporation, are the only space available for recreation activities for the public in the city and are poorly maintained for many years now.

Under the Smart City Mission, the corporation has proposed to carry out development works for redesigning the layouts and also to create more amenities in both the parks. The parks were closed for public in April, 2019. However, work did not commence for three months. Later, works began and are in progress.

Corporation officials said that skywalks, modern seating facilities, landscape, fountains, greenery premises, footpaths, more sports equipments for children and other facilities would be created. They said that works on to construct compound walls were completed and other works would be taken up in a phased manner. “All the works will be over by the end of April and the park would be opened for the public during summer vacation”, they added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/gmk3n/article30579327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER17-VOCC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/renovation-of-parks-to-be-completed-within-three-months/article30579328.ece
206,2020/01/16,Lessons taught by sages,"The Supreme One incarnates to help jivatmas attain moksha. As Krishna, He gave the world the Bhagavad Gita. But He also got Bhishma to tell Yudhishthira about the power of His names. Bhishma had already set an example to everyone by his virtuous conduct. Sages have laid down rules which we must follow to attain His feet.

When He Himself has taken avataras, to show us the right path, why did He send sages to instruct us? Although as Rama He lived an exemplary life, we might dismiss it saying He was able to adhere to dharma, because He was the Supreme One. But if a fellow human being were to advise us and show us how to live life in accordance with dharma, then we are likely to pay attention. That was the reason why He sent rishis to this world, to give us important lessons in life, said Velukkudi Krishnan in a discourse. Saunaka was one such rishi who listed steps to follow in life in order to reach Him and to be rid once and for all of repeated births and deaths. Saunaka’s advice is compiled under the title Vishnu dharma, and it came in response to questions asked by King Sataneeka.

Sataneeka had an illustrious lineage. He came in the line of Pariskhit. Parikshit, knowing that he had only a few days to live, listened to Suka’s narration of Srimad Bhagavatam. Parikshit’s son was Janamejaya and Janamejaya’s son was Sataneeka. Kings used to pay attention to what sages told them, for they needed to govern in accordance with dharma. They, therefore, paid heed to rishis.

Sage Vaisampayana narrates the story of the Mahabharata to King Janamejaya. Janamejaya’s son turns to sage Saunaka for answers to his questions. In Vishnu dharma, there are stories within the main story, conversations within the main conversation.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/lessons-taught-by-sages/article30578090.ece
207,2020/01/16,The memory of the Italian crib,"If you went past the Sacred Heart Cathedral any time between Christmas and January 6, known as Epiphany day and celebrated by Shakespeare in his play Twelfth Night, you are sure to have seen the crib depicting the manger in which Christ was born. Along with this would have been small statues of the Magi or three Wise Men from the East who went to worship him. It was a bright star which led them on their journey. The Nativity scene brings to mind a grander crib which was brought from Italy by the Greek merchant John’s family and presented to the Cathedral in Agra before the Cathedral in Delhi was built.

The life-size statues of Baby Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Wise Men, shepherds and their sheep have been maintained with great care for many decades. The cracked arms and crowns of the magi have been taped and so also the horn of the shepherd. Incidentally three men, probably from the Russian Embassy stopped by the church to see the crib which reminded them of their Orthodox Church. For them, Christmas, fell on January 7, and they must have missed the three midwives who, according to their belief came for Jesus’ delivery.

Now there hangs a tale from the Italian crib dating back to 1938 and one is reminded of it year after year on January 6th, as it also marks the birthday of this scribe and is well worth repeating: It was a Thursday with the sweet aroma of joss-sticks lingering in the winter air and the parting kick of Christmas. The church bells had just pealed the Angelus, and the old Archbishop crossed himself thrice while a young woman, who was just 18 years old, tried to control her pangs of labour.

“Thursday’s child is weeping and gnashing”, says the old rhyme and Ruby wanted to prolong her labour so that the birth of her first-born could be delayed until after midnight. Evening marks the end of day and the advent of night. It was the time when the lamplighter came running into the gullies over 80 years ago.

He came again that day, lighting the lamps which had lain barren from cock-crow to twilight. His lamps flickered in the frosty air much like the stars overhead and in the nearby house a young poet echoed the memorable lines: “Shama jalao bahut udaas hai sham”, for the evening was indeed sad and needed a lamp to brighten it.

As if infected by the mood, a baker, tired after the day’s work, came and stood at the shrine of the Sayyid Baba outside Ruby’s house. He had bought joss-sticks, batasas, candles and flowers. It was Thursday and the aroma of this ritual day hung heavy over Azam Khan’s locality. Ruby watched it all from the window upstairs. She wondered what blessings the man sought, perhaps riches, an end to worry, recovery from an illness, or the welfare of his wife and children.

Two streets away evening was being ushered in to the sound of the tabla and the harmonium and the beat of ghungroos on tender feet as the courtesans of the city got into stride after sundown. The Lotharios were aware of this as they made their way to them. They had garlands in their hands, kaajal in their eyes and the sweet scent of Hina pervaded their person.

Just then Ruby’s husband Tom hurried by on his bicycle. One of the Lotharios recognised him and winked in greeting. He knew this young acquaintance was not one of those who spent their evenings above the marketplace where the courtesans had their quarters. He was a sincere sort of person, wise beyond his years and one who worked hard for a living. He had a big family to support: brothers, an unmarried sister and a paranoid mother. His first wife had died in childbirth two years ago. He had to marry again because of domestic compulsions. It was his second wife who was now in labour. Tom cycled on. Meanwhile, Ruby clung to her quilt, bit her lip and gripped the hand of the midwife tight while her sister-in-law stroked her curly hair. The door chain clanged, somebody opened it and in walked Tom, tired and breathless. Ruby could hold herself no longer. She delivered there and then on the cot.

Tom tiptoed into the room and peered at his wife. She smiled weakly and pointed towards the little figure beside her: “It’s the feast of the Three Kings”, she said. Tom put his hand on the baby’s brow. “The gift of the Magi”, he replied as he blew a kiss to Ruby and walked out beaming with delight. They are both dead now but the much repaired Italian crib is still there as a reminder.

208,2020/01/16,"Supreme Court nod for smog towers, anti-smog guns in Delhi","The Supreme Court has agreed with the Delhi government’s proposal to install a smog tower at Connaught Place within three months even as it passed a slew of directions to reduce air pollution.

""As proposed in the reply of the Delhi government, let the smog tower at Connaught Place be completed by Delhi government as proposed in their reply affidavit,"" a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta ordered on January 13.

The Bench also ordered a smog tower to be installed in Anand Vihar as pointed out by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The court ordered the Delhi government to provide space of 30x30 metres for installation of an experimental tower at Anand Vihar within seven days. The court said this project would be funded by the Centre even as the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change would monitor it. The court directed the project to be completed in three months.

The court directed that anti-smog guns should be used in Delhi and the National Capital Regions (NCR) at large construction sites, road construction stretches, mining activities; large parking sites on unpaved areas, during large public gatherings, demolition activities and while sprinkling on dust-prone traffic corridors.

The court made it compulsory for authorities to use of anti-smog guns in Delhi-NCR at the site of projects that require environmental clearance from the State/Central level and which have a built-up area of more than 20,000sqmt including excavation, material handling and other dust-generating activities. The authorities would have to prepare a ‘pollutor pays’ policy to cover the cost of installation of the anti-smog guns at these sites.

The court directed the Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan government to identify plastic, industrial and other toxic waste and ensure they are not burnt but incinerated. Piled-up waste has to be removed within six weeks. The court also directed the pollution control boards of the four States to monitor at night and take stringent action against polluting industries.

The court asked the Delhi government to work out a comprehensive plan within three months to have full (100%) capacity to deal with garbage and wastes. The court has also directed the pollution control board and the Indian Bureau of Standards to randomly check the quality of water supplied in Delhi and submit a report in one month.

The court ordered penal action against developers in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan found flouting the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules of 2016. The court ordered the States to file status reports on the action taken against rogue developers, including how many have been blacklisted. The court has sought a report on the existing facilities for construction and demolition waste recycling in the four States. It has asked the four States to come out with a comprehensive plan on waste management.

The court has ordered local authorities of Ghaziabad, Panipat and Meerut to ensure remedial measures are taken in connection with waste pile-ups in certain areas and file a report in a month.

The court asked why Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab should not be “saddled” with the burden to pay compensation for failing to prevent pollution and stubble-burning. It ordered a comprehensive plan to prevent stubble-burning to be placed before it.

The 11-page order said the plan should have a detailed plan for crop residuary management and its use as fertilizer, cattle food and bio-fuel. It asked the government to take a final decision on the incentive/disincentive of ₹100 per quintal and the in-situ farming.

Further, the court directed the Centre, Punjab, Haryana and UP governments to prepare a scheme to give access to small and marginal farmers to advanced farming machines such as combine harvesters, happy seeders, etc., either free of charge or for a nominal rent.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3zjtp/article30551818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/supreme-court-nod-for-smog-towers-anti-smog-guns-in-delhi/article30577363.ece
209,2020/01/16,"No office of profit in NDMC membership of AAP MLA, says President","The President has held Aam Aadmi Party MLA Surender Singh is not disqualified in a case of alleged office of profit for being a member of the New Delhi Municipal Council, according to the December 31, 2019 order published by the Election Commission of India on Thursday.

Mr. Singh, AAP MLA from the Delhi Cantonment Assembly constituency, was found not to holding an office of profit by being a member of the NDMC, according to the ECI’s opinion on September 16, 2019 that President Ram Nath Kovind had agreed with in his December 31 order.

“The Election Commission held that as per Section 4 of the NDMC Act, 1994, there is a statutory mandate to appoint two such MLAs to NDMC who have been elected to the Delhi Legislative Assembly from an Assembly Constituency which falls wholly or partly in the NDMC area. Hence, Shri Suremder Singh, MLA, did not incur disqualification,” the ECI’s opinion read.

The petition, filed by Sanjeev Kumar Rajput on August 13, 2018 and referred by the President to the ECI on November 15, 2019, alleged Mr. Singh held an office of profit as he had been allotted a furnished house (Flat 13, Type V, Yashwant Place Market) in Chanakyapuri and an office at the NDMC headquarters, Palika Kendra, the order said. The order cited the ECI’s opinion, which said a bare reading of the NDMC Act showed that it was a statutory mandate to appoint two MLAs whose constituencies fall partly or wholly in the NDMC area as members.

In its opinion, the ECI cited previous complaints against then-Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit and then-BJP MLA Karan Singh Tanwar, a nominated member of the NDMC currently, where it had on February 2, 2012 held that the two MLAs did not attract disqualification for being NDMC members.

210,2020/01/16,People brave rain to attend anti-CAA protest in Delhi University,"Scores of people attended a protest meeting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Delhi University’s Arts Faculty on Thursday, which was addressed by social activists amid heavy police presence.

Among those who addressed the crowd were activist Medha Patkar, Tushar Gandhi, retired judge Kolse Patil, lawyer Karuna Nundy and journalist Arfa Khanum Sherwani. With protesters standing through a spell of rain and continuing to raise slogans, speakers lauded them for their determination calling it a “people’s movement” and a fight to “save the Constitution”.

“Your movement would define the future,” said Mr. Patil, who attacked the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, the RSS and the Sangh parivar. He urged students to read former RSS chief Golwalkar’s works to be able to attack it, to read author Rana Ayub’s “Gujrat Files” to learn about the Gujrat riots. More people must study social sciences and economics as opposed to mathematics and science, he said.

Ms. Nundy, who elaborated various issues with the CAA and the NRC, argued that it would cause trouble for all people without documentation and could lead to “never ending cycles” of inquiry. She attacked the ‘rumours’ being spread on how the NRC had not been started, highlighting that the exercise had already been written into the CAA. “I speak out against this Bill because as a lawyer I took a pledge to protect the Constitution,” said Ms. Nundy who read out the Preamble of the Constitution.

Ms. Patkar, who relayed stories from different parts of the country where atrocities had allegedly been committed, asked what was the fault of the people in Muzaffarnagar who weren’t participating in protests but were beaten up and whose houses were raided. She also alleged that there was deployment of “non-uniformed” people along with police forces in places such as the Aligarh Muslim University and the JNU to attack students.

Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora, passed the directions after the jail authorities said they have written to the Delhi government on the issue of scheduled execution on January 22 in view of pending remedies.

The court was hearing a plea by one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, Mukesh Kumar Singh, seeking postponement of the date of his execution on the ground that his mercy petition is pending with the President.

The lawyer appearing for Singh told the court that there are subsequent developments that necessitate setting aside the death warrants. Singh’s counsel moved the trial court immediately after the Delhi High Court declined to entertain his plea to set aside the January 7 order issuing his death warrant and asked them to approach the lower court.

The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before being thrown out on the road. She died on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

213,2020/01/16,Bollywood is indebted to them,"“When Deepika Padukone produces a movie today, everyone applauds her. But imagine owning a production house in the pre-Independent era, how empowered and courageous a woman must be to do that? Jaddan Bai did it at a time when other women were in purdah and barely even got out of home. She was a visionary of her time but, sadly, has been forgotten by the very industry she contributed towards.” exclaims Manjari Chaturvedi.

A dancer and a chronicler of the lost women artistes of the last century, Manjari Chaturvedi has dedicated her attention towards rediscovering forgotten female stalwarts of Indian history. Her current show, ‘Begums and Baijis of Bollywood’ is a part of her Courtesan Project, which traces the journey of women artistes who were never given the recognition they deserved owing to their background.

The production narrates the journey of women who laid the foundation of Hindi cinema. The production will predominantly share the stories of four supremely talented women artistes: Jaddan Bai, Mukhtar Begum, Jahanara Kajjan and Begum Akhtar.

“The women who were part of Hindi cinema when it started were largely a part of the tawaif and baiji tradition. They were singers, dancers or artistes of what was called the kotha who made the transition onto the silver screen. But, unfortunately with Bollywood being strictly patriarchal, these women were not recognised.” she explains and questions, “While you have an award in the name of Dadasaheb Phalke, you don’t even hear the mention of these women who in fact gave Bollywood the very things which made it popular around the world — music and dance!”

Manjari Chaturvedi | Photo Credit: By special arrangement

The danseuse is full of stories of these stars of a bygone era. “Jahanara Kajjan was a superstar of her time. In fact, her face was plastered all across the UK for selling everything from powders to creams.” she states and adds the reason behind the reasons for their complete invisibility in the annals of history when she says, “They were looked down upon as they came from the tawaif tradition which incidentally was the British way of thinking. They equated them with prostitution and never gave them the respect they deserved. These were artistes who spent decades perfecting their art. Just because of their backgrounds, they were bracketed and Indians too started to look at them through the eyes of the British which further added to the stigma attached.”

While the artistes are forgotten their art still survives. The 90-minute theatrical dance production will recreate iconic songs sung by these artistes. The list of songs which showcase their prowess is long and legendary: from ‘Hamari attariya’ (last pictured on Madhuri Dixit) which was from the repertoire of the tawaifs and was immortalised by Begum Akhtar to the evergreen ‘Mohe panghat mein nandlal’ which was a thumri sung by Indubala who learnt it from Gauhar Jaan or the timeless ‘Aaj jaane ki zid na karo’, which was taught to Farida Khannum by her elder sister Mukhtar Begum, the lyrics might have changed but the essence remains the same.

“Their music touches our heart but we refuse to acknowledge the contribution,” rues Manjari before adding, “We all know the songs but not the stories behind them. There was a strong gender bias created based on their personal histories. Akthari Begum Faizabadi had to become Begum Akhtar while Siddeshwari Bai became Siddeshwari Devi for respect. These women kept entire art forms alive.”

214,2020/01/16,Exploring centuries of kolams,"Pulli, padi, chikku. Dots, lines, curves. Occasionally, a full-fledged peacock etched freehand. Kolams are a part and parcel of everyday life. But they have also come up frequently during historian Meenakshi Devaraj’s research on Sangam literature. Throughout the large body of work, extending over about six centuries, kolams have remained the bastion of women.

Devaraj, has found only two exceptions so far: ghosts in a 12th Century poem who made decorative patterns out of pearl dust, and a ritual specific to Karnataka where the onus of kolams is on men.

“Kolaputhagam that came in 1899 mentions about the panchavarnam, aka five main colors used in kolam: white, black, red, yellow and green.” In practice however, white rice flour with a bit of red on festive occasions is used.

For architect Thirupurasundari Sevvel, kolams make for interesting study not only in social, but also in spatial terms. For her, the basic essence behind this artistic ritual is the human instinct to “beautify your space of living with what you have around you. We have been doing this since prehistoric times, when cavemen would draw patterns with mud in an effort to decorate.” She adds, “There are four ways to classify a kolam: spatial, by occasion, by region and by family.”

By family, she means motifs that have been handed down generations. Spatially, she says, patterns differ based on what part of the house they are etched on; kolams at entrances are different from motifs drawn in kitchens, or intricate patterns in prayer rooms. In terms of region, Devaraj says that kolams in Chettinad stand out in design because they portray family homes, with members depicted in neat rows and a roof for shelter. Other regions give emphasis to objects that have significance in their daily lives, from everyday kitchen spices to jewellery.

By tradition, Sevvel points out how wedding and temple festival kolams are far more social than kolams drawn at home. “It can take about seven or eight people to make a wedding kolam. It becomes a community activity. Different people draw different parts, and yet it comes out intricate and uniform.”

Another way of looking at kolams is by their purpose. In Sevvel’s words, most kolams today play the role of welcome mats, albeit with intricate art and centuries of patterns to back them up. Kolams have also been used in mathematical research, with their hexagons, dotted grids, hidden motifs and loops.

For Sevvel, however, kolams play a third role: therapy. She has been conducting kolam workshops for children with autism, people with restricted limb movement and three to six-year-olds. “It is soothing,” says Sevvel, “We use rice paste on my red oxide floor since it is easier to wipe off, and the simple effort of making the batter, placing dots and connecting them into patterns seems to help.” So much so, that the trio’s workshop has now entered its 10th edition.

This Pongal, grand and intricate kolams will embellish doorways, courtyards and streets across the State. When the festive season recedes, however, the art will continue to live on.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/diit4/article30573488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MPKOLAM,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/exploring-centuries-of-indias-traditional-kolams/article30573492.ece

“As Google is not monitoring the genuineness of the websites, people are getting cheated,” said Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar.

When a person calls the fake customer care number, the trickster asks them to furnish the bank details, including OTP and PIN and transfer the amount to their online wallets.

Referring to one such case reported with Cyber Crime police, Mr. Sajjanar said the victim ordered for sweets worth ₹200 from Zomato app and found that they were stale. Further, when he searched for the customer care service of Zomato on Google to complain and return the products, he found a mobile number (9330017233) as the customer care service.

“When contacted, the fraudster asked the complainant to send the details of his bank account and UPI number for a refund of the amount. Later, he found that ₹70,000 was debited from his account, as he shared the credentials,” the Commissioner said.

216,2020/01/16,EVDM wing to issue one-time notice to erring hospitals,"The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s Enforcement, Vigilance, and Disaster Management (EVDM) wing which inspected around 1,000 private hospitals in the corporation limits observed that many of them deviated from rules such as not maintaining fire safety measures. By mid-February, 500 more hospitals would be inspected.

The fire at Shine Children’s Hospital, LB Nagar in October (2019) third week which led to the death of an infant and injuries to a few more raised questions about fire safety measures at private hospitals.

A few days after the fire, the EVDM wing issued e-notices to 1,830 hospitals asking for copies of Fire No Objection Certificate (NoC), Occupancy Certificate, Trade Licence, and two more documents. Of them, 300 were found to be shut down. There after, they started to conduct inspections.

Director of the EVDM wing Vishwajit Kampati said that after wrapping up the inspections, they would issue one-time notices to correct the deviations in 15 to 45days, depending on the size of the hospital. If any hospital does not comply with the rules or correct the deviation, officials would shut down their billing counters without disturbing patient services.

Fire check

Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services department personnel started to collect list of hospitals in the State from District Medical and Health Officers (DMHOs). Officials said that they would check if fire safety measures were maintained at hospitals. If the measures were not taken, the hospital managements would be asked to correct it.

As per rules, any commercial building above 15 metres of height should get the NoC from the Fire Services department. If the commercial building is below 15 metres, the NoC should be obtained from the EVDM wing.

However, regardless of whether a hospital building is above or below 15 metres, the Fire Services department personnel would conduct the check.

Regional Fire Officer (Central Region) V Papaiah said that if there were any lapses, they would suggest to the hospitals managements measures to be taken to avert fire.

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday launched a salvo against Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat for his comments which he reportedly made on ‘radicalised’ individuals who should be put in ‘de-radicalisation’ camps.

Reacting to reports on the issue, Mr Owaisi described Gen. Rawat’s comments as ridiculous.

“This is not the first ridiculous statement he has made. Policy is decided by civilian administration and not by any General. By speaking on policy/politics, he is undermining civilian supremacy,” he tweeted.

In another tweet, he sought to know who would ‘deradicalise lynchers and their political masters’ and those ‘opposing citizenship for Assam’s Bengali Muslims’. “Maybe deradicalise “Badla” Yogi & “Pakistan jao” Meerut SP? Maybe deradicalise those imposing hardship on us through NPR-NRC?” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cds-comment-ridiculous-owaisi/article30579217.ece
218,2020/01/16,"At Davos meet, KTR to seek investment","IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao will introduce Telangana to top economic leaders of the world attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, seeking investment in sectors that have high employment potential.

The Minister, who will be participating in WEF from January 21 to 24, said that his focus would be on sectors like food processing, electronics, textile and life sciences, apart from IT.

At an interaction here, he said the Davos meeting would give a great opportunity to mix with the best world economic leaders and a greater chance to sell the ideas and provide a platform for future investment. He recalled how his chance meeting at Davos had actually led to setting up of Mahindra campus in Warangal.

A Telangana Pavilion was being set up and the Minister had several scheduled meetings and follow-ups. The biggest advantage of Davos was that there was no wastage of time and it was just business as they came with a specific purpose. “You may have to wait for three years to meet some of those top businessmen but in Davos it can happen in three days.” He, however, cautioned that the meetings may not directly lead to investment. Some of those meetings would lead to new announcements while some were just ice-breakers.

He said that as a salesperson, before entering politics, he understood how the deals were struck after several meetings and not at the first one. The idea was to ensure the recall value of Telangana in Davos as and when businessmen thought of India, Telangana should automatically ring in their mind.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tjclez/article30579750.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-KTR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/at-davos-ktr-to-seek-investment-in-job-potential-sectors/article30579055.ece

Police said the offence took place around 9.30 p.m. when the victim, Yada Goud and accused Sk. Asif went to an isolated place to consume alcohol. “The duo picked up an argument, following which Asif stabbed Goud with his dagger,” police said. Later, the accused went to Goud’s house to inform his wife, Sowjanya, of his death.

220,2020/01/16,Owaisi hits out at de-radicalisation idea of Bipin Rawat,"Member of Parliament from Hyderabad and president of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen Asaduddin Owaisi, on Thursday severely criticised the ‘idea’ of de-radicalisation camps for Kashmiri children floated by Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat at the Raisina Dialogue 2020 in New Delhi.

He said de-radicalisation was needed for those persons who killed innocent and poor people from minorities in incidents of lynchings in recent times in the country.

At a well attended public meeting in Adilabad distict headquarters town held in connection with the ongoing municipal election, the AIMIM chief said radicalisation of people should be prevented instead of talking of de-radicalisation of juveniles. He quoted several examples of lynchings to support his point of view.

NRC in Assam

Continuing about radicalisation, Mr. Owaisi quoted the example of Assam where five lakh Assamese and an equal number of Muslims are set to be excluded from the National Register of Citizens. The Assamese, however, will get the citizenship thanks to the Citizenship Amendment Act but the Muslims will be deprived of the status because of the ‘discriminatory’ provisions of the CAA.

“Now who is going to stop radicalisation of the Muslims who are being discriminated upon,” the Hyderabad MP questioned. It is clear that the CAA is discriminatory on the basis of religion which is bound to radicalise those discriminated against,” he observed.

Mr. Owaisi also spoke about his efforts in getting the National Population Register stalled in Telangana. “I appealed to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to stall the NPR,” he revealed.

The AIMIM president exhorted the gathering to support his efforts in stalling the NPR.

222,2020/01/16,Fake message on social media creates confusion,"An image with photographs of Muslim religious figures, along with a message asking voters to press NOTA on the EVMs in the upcoming municipal polls in view of Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao’s ‘silence’ on implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register, was widely shared on social media, creating confusion among several people. The message has since been found to be fake.

The image has mugshots of religious leaders such as Hamed Mohammad Khan from Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, cleric Maulana Mohammed Husamuddin Sami, Syed Ahmedul Hussaini Sayeed Qadri, and Maulana Hafiz Peer Shabbir from Jamiat-e-Ulama, among others. Many of the religious leaders are from the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen-backed United Muslim Forum.

A statement, wrongly attributed to Muslim religious leaders, nearly a month after their meeting with the CM, claims that no clarity on the CAA-NRC-NPR has since come forward. The ‘statement’ then urges voters to ‘vote in favour of NOTA’.

The Hindu spoke to at least four religious leaders who said they had not issued any statement in connection with the civic polls. “This so-called statement is completely fake. Neither I, nor other ulama (religious leaders) have made such comments. We are indeed against CAA, NRC and NPR. We went to meet the CM in this regard. But it is for the CM and Home Minister Mahmood Ali to take a final call. While the Home Minister has spoken against NRC, he is yet to speak against NPR. We are confident the Telangana government will take the right decision,” Maulana Sayeed Qadri said.

Later in the day, United Muslim Forum general secretary Syed Muneeruddin Mukhtar issued a statement. “This is rumour mongering and an attempt to deceive the public. The United Muslim Forum has taken a note of this mischief and will take legal action against those responsible,” the statement read.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fake-message-on-social-media-creates-confusion/article30578649.ece

226,2020/01/16,What is your sign?,"Pradosh Swain’s works that explore 12 zodiac signs — though surreal — are not the usual works revealing the traits of these signs. Interspersed with a social message, the 24-acrylic and oil paintings make us aware of the change happening in society. The Delhi-based artist’s exhibition, titled ‘Zodiac Zing’, at Aalankritha Art Gallery has two two themes — zodiac signs with trees and stones.

One of the works on the seventh astrological sign Libra is inspired by its ‘equal’ sign. Says Pradosh, “Libra stands for equality, so the Nature we have destroyed should be compensated equally by creating an environment to help it grow back.” An Aries person is headstrong and punctual and the work encourages us to become close to nature and sustain it else, we might become insignificant like dust. Leo is considered the king of the jungle and because of deforestation the lion is forced to enter villages and fight for its survival. The artist explains his reasons to work with zodiac signs is to bring their focus on the other social issues in the painting. “It is a research-based work. Many people are curious about zodiac signs and when they watch these paintings, they will inadvertently look at the other issues mentioned in it.”

Pradosh did his Fine Arts from Bhubaneshwar and worked in Orissa state museum for 12 years and also displayed his paintings. Vexed with his mundane government job and a dull art scenario, Pradosh took a risk and resigned his stable job to move to Delhi. “If god has given me the talent, there must be a purpose to it. Also, there was no challenge to my creativity, ” he recalls. Being a gold medallist in the art college, he felt if his juniors can settle well in the art field, he too can make it.

He shifted along with his wife and two-and-half-year old son to Delhi in 2006 and after initial struggle, created a space for himself. “There are thousands of artists working in Delhi and to stand out, I had to bring some uniqueness to my work. I was willing to struggle and take on the challenges.” He says the capital city has helped him to fulfil his belief that ‘art is not just for beauty but has the power to change world. I believe in art, which has a social message.”

The artist has worked on different themes highlighting different causes. Some of his works were on climate change, urbanisation, Nature, child labour and lost childhood. One of his works titled ‘Imported from Mars’ highlighted the modern scenario of drying water resources. “It is an irony that our earth is covered with 70 per cent of water yet we have this global water crisis and importing water,” he remarks.

Pradosh has got a senior fellowship in CCRT in Delhi and is working on a series based on Hindustani music. The artist considers the series completion will be his gift to himself. “During my museum stint in Bhubaneshwar, there was a mention of raag in pata chitra. I am still researching on it and trying to visualise in contemporary style.”

227,2020/01/16,Shantanu Moitra and the Indian moon mission,"Besides music, composer Shantanu Moitra has a passion for travelling and science. In 2016, he conceptualised and curated the concert, Song Of The Himalayas, based on his adventures in the mountainous region. Now, he’s gone even higher, literally, to produce a show inspired by India’s moon mission.

Chandrayaan: Celebrating India’s Journey To The Moon will blend science and music, in a show presented by the NCPA and the Sahachari Foundation. Using folk and semi-classical compositions with appropriate visuals, Moitra plans to give the audience a unique experience. Best known for composing music in Hindi films Parineeta, Lage Raho Munnabhai, 3 Idiots and Pink, Moitra says that India is a country which loves adventure. “Even when we didn’t make it at the final stage, nobody complained. Instead, everybody was praising the efforts made in trying to achieve our goal,” he adds.

Finding the rhythm

The idea germinated over a conversation with filmmaker-lyricist Gulzar. Moitra recalls, “Gulzarsaab is very passionate about astronomy. We began discussing Chandrayaan, and that’s when I first thought of this concept.” The main task, of course, was to get the scientific elements accurately within the musical space. For this, Moitra consulted scientist Prof. Tarun Ghosh, who once happened to be his classmate. The composer had to understand the various stages that made up the moon journey, and come up with the right melodies, rhythms and visuals to go with them. Moitra says that since the project involved science, many people would expect electronica sounds and synthesisers to dominate. “I wanted to make it sound as Indian as possible, and our music has a wealth of traditional compositions and chants that are perfect for such a show, and remind us of our roots,” he says.

The next step was to choose musicians. Says Moitra, “I had a clear idea of what instruments I would use, and how the vocal parts would be presented. To enhance the ambience, I will use certain effects to produce sounds that would be heard during the course of the journey,” says the composer.

Melange of mediums

The concert will feature vocalist Kaushiki Chakraborty, veena player Jayanti Kumaresh, flautist Rakesh Chaurasia and violinist Ambi Subramaniam. Tabla player Ojas Adhiya and mridangam exponent Sridhar Parthasarathy will handle the rhythm section. “One tends to believe science and arts are two different things. Through this concert, I want to show that is not the case,” emphasises Moitra.

Chandrayaan: Celebrating India’s Journey To The Moon will be performed on January 18 at 6.30 p.m. at the Tata Theatre, NCPA; more details at bookmyshow.com",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ayjvue/article30578187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bm-pg4-Shantanu-Moitra-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/shantanu-moitra-and-the-indian-moon-mission/article30578188.ece
228,2020/01/16,Vh1 Supersonic 2020 goes a notch higher,"Ever since 2017 when a white rapper and hitmaker named Macklemore made his India debut, Vh1 Supersonic was viewed as the music festival that would go beyond its electronic music roots. Now three years on, there’s another white rapper – Machine Gun Kelly – occupying the headliner space for the three-day festival’s seventh edition, to be held next month in Pune.

The 29-year-old musician (and actor, if you saw him in Netflix’s Bird Box and the Motley Crue biopic The Dirt) has been active for about a decade now, but Machine Gun Kelly (real name Colson Baker) found global fame only in the last five years. Whether it’s filling the role of a typical bad boy on songs like ‘Bad Things’ with singer Camila Cabello or matching the energy that artists like Papa Roach, Blink 182’s Travis Barker or Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda bring, Machine Gun Kelly makes for a high-energy headliner for Supersonic. Perhaps most recently in 2018 was when more fans in India were familiar with him, when he started a beef with rapper Eminem on ‘Rap Devil’, which was a response to the veteran artist’s takedown on the song ‘Not Alike’.

With a little bit of new also comes the very familiar – super-producer and DJ Diplo has also been announced to perform at Vh1 Supersonic 2020. It was just about five years ago in December 2014 that Diplo’s over-the-top twerk-friendly dancehall and EDM group Major Lazer made their India debut at Vh1 Supersonic’s Arcade tour edition, but he’s clearly always ready to hop on a plane to India. We’re not just talking about how Diplo brought his global event property Mad Decent Block Party to India in 2016, but also how Major Lazer’s smash hit ‘Lean On’ was partly shot in Karjat and Vasai. Diplo said at the time of the video release in a press statement, “India is special and its beauty absolutely humbled me. […] India feels like some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future. The experience is something we’ll never forget.”

Making her India debut at Vh1 Supersonic is rising hip-hop star Sampa The Great, who has roots in Zambia and lived in Australia. Coming to India on the back of her critically acclaimed album The Return, expect buoyant vibes that’s likely to start a party. For the more devoted electronic music fans, the festival still keeps its promise by programming Dutch techno veteran Speedy J, American EDM DJ-producer Gryffin and Dutch house music duo Magnificence.

There might have been a huge delay in announcing their lineup this time around – for reasons that remain unknown – but Vh1 Supersonic is finally adding its worth to the February calendar of music festivals. Curator and co-founder Nikhil Chinapa says it’s about staying ahead of the curve and throwing surprises at fans each time with the lineup, while also “going a notch higher”. He adds that the festival is banking on superhit makers this time around. “Diplo’s recent releases include a string of global hits and collaborations with music’s A-listers and Machine Gun Kelly’s new single has smashed past the 100 million streams mark in the blink of an eye,” Chinapa says. With the full line-up yet to be revealed, Chinapa hints that they’ll introduce a K-Pop group for the first time at Vh1 Supersonic and become “more inclusive” with regards to genres.

229,2020/01/16,A memorable multi-starrer at Swami Haridas Tansen Sangeet Nritya Samaroh,"Dedicated to Pandit Ravi Shankar, this year’s Swami Haridas Tansen Sangeet Nritya Samaroh, organised at the Shankarlal Hall of Modern School, opened with a melodious Jhinjhoti on sarod by Ustad Ashish Khan. Pt. Bikram Ghosh accompanied him with two pairs of tabla tuned to madhya and taar shadja respectively, reciprocating the sarod bols in different octaves.

Flanked by Shiraz Khan, his nephew and disciple and Manik Khan, the youngest son of Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, Ashish’s tuneful alaap created an appealing ambience and the masitkhani gat elaborated the raga at length. But the drut gat, composed by Ashish’s grandfather Baba Allauddin Khan, took Bikram for a ride with its deceptive mukhda (the opening phrase), when he showed the ‘sam’ on khali, the 9th beat of Teentala instead of the first, which is the sam of any tala. It was because the tongue in cheek composition had proceeded without taking note of the ‘sam’ and took a breath only on khali, stopping there for a while.

Ashish played a shorter version of the composition later to offer Bikram an opportunity to showcase his prowess. The Ustad also gave ample opportunity to the young sarodias to revel in imaginative improvisations during the concluding Zila Kafi, playing a couple of old compositions of Baba Allauddin Khan.

Echo effect

Begum Parveen Sultana presented the timely raga Puriya Dhanashri with a vilambit and the chhota Khayal “Payaliya jhanakar…” with complicated sargam and akar taans and the customary echo effect that gets her instant applause. There was a thumri in Mishra Pahadi, “Kaun gali gayo Shyam…” where Vinay Mishra’s sensitive touches on Harmonium and the tabla laggi of Mithilesh with the Banarasi ‘Dha tin na da’, added allure. The Hamsadhwani tarana was understandable on public demand but there was no need to succumb to the ‘farmaish’ of her film song from “Kudrat” that wiped off the positive vibes of the classical concert.

One of the strengths of our age-old Guru-Shishya tradition is the way a musician ages in his art. The mature treatment of Jaijaiwanti, Hansadhwani, and the romantic Pahadi Dhun by Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia on his bewitching bansuri and the vocal performance of Pt. Chhannu Lal Mishra were cases in point. Increasing weakness through age, affecting the muscles of his vocal chord, may have resulted in making Chhannu Lal less tuneful, but his zeal was intact. He opened with his customary remarks “Stage is like a temple for me”, citing the oft-told story of Narad, where Vishnu tells him ‘I dwell where my devotees sing”.

Vidushi Uma Sharma

He presented some compositions in rare ragas like Shahana, Hem-Kalyan, a self-composed Bhajan invoking Hanuman, set to Ada Chautal before he reached his favourite domain of thumri dadra and invited the evergreen Kathak exponent Uma Sharma, who organises the event with the HCL Concerts, to join him with her captivating abhinaya.

The evening had opened with an impressive dhrupad recital by Ud. Wasifuddin Dagar presenting a profound Puriya with detailed alap and a Chautala composition. He concluded with a sool-tala Bandish in Malkauns, accompanied on pakhawaj by Pt. Mohan Shyam Sharma.

The most gratifying performance was by Pt. Ulhas Kashalkar, who brought out the vocal enunciation of his exceptionally difficult gayaki, which is the confluence of Gwalior, Jaipur and Agra gharanas in his memorable Jogkauns and Nayaki Kanada.

Opening with the vilambit Ektaal composition “Sughar var payo….”, and the popular Chhota Khayal “Peer parai…” in Jogkauns, he offered the most satiating savouring of the raga with perfect balance and care. Nayaki Kanada explored the hidden recesses of the raga through the Rupak and Teentala compositions. The pieces had clean and brisk pacing across the scale, showing symmetries along the way. There were bol taans taking leaps of great distances with a fine command over the lyrical substance of the compositions. The most understanding theka on tabla by Pt. Suresh Talwalkar, an inspired harmonium accompaniment by Vinay Mishra and the adequate vocal support by Ojesh Pratap Singh were admirable.

The melodious Tilak Kamod on the singing sitar of Ud. Shujat Khan was the other attraction of the evening. The compelling appeal and the tone of his instrument and the nostalgic composition were a sheer delight but he unnecessarily wasted time towards the end in the prolonged, chaotic jhala.

The concluding evening opened with an amicable Lalita-Gauri on sarod by Aman and Ayaan Ali, the gifted sons and disciples of Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. They presented a pensive alaap and compositions set to Jhaptala and Ada Chautala in this introspective raga. Accompanied on tabla by Satyajit Talwalkar and Anuvrat Chatterjee, they also presented exquisite compositions of their Guru in raga Nand-Kauns and Malkauns.

Melodious sarod recital

The festival concluded with the melodious sarod recital by Ustad Amjad Ali Khan. The tonal purity of his luminous sarod strikes the mind and heart at once, but he left the discerning listeners somewhat unquenched. The short alaap in the rare raga Bihari and a nostalgic composition set to addha theka was a warm-up for Darbari Kanhada.

Majestic raga

The very opening statement of the profound raga with the ‘Andolit Gamak’ (oscillation) on the mandra dhaivat and then on the Ati Mandra Gandhar during the alaap, fuelled high anticipation for a detailed treatment to the majestic raga, with reposeful alaap-jod-jhala to begin with, but surprisingly, it all ended up within 15 minutes and Khan Saheb switched over to Rageshree.

He played a couple of compositions set to Jhaptal and Ada-Chautala, providing ample opportunity to both the tabla accompanists to showcase their prowess. The third gat composition in the same raga, set to Teentala, was followed by the Rabindranath Tagore song , “Ekla Chalo” and the Assam folk tune of Bihu. He concluded the festival with a Bhairavi Dhun set to the lilting gait of dadra, where he most skilfully incorporated all twelve notes and left the audience enthralled.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ym8x9t/article30576591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/260A0499,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/a-memorable-multi-starrer-at-swami-haridas-tansen-sangeet-nritya-samaroh/article30576594.ece
230,2020/01/16,How did the Pancharatna kritis originate?,"Today, no matter where it happens, the Tyagaraja Aradhana is synonymous with the choral singing of the Ghana Raga Pancharatnam — the five songs being ‘Jagadanandakaraka’ (Nata), ‘Dudukugala’ (Gaula), ‘Sadhinchene’ (Arabhi), ‘Kanakanaruchira’ (Varali) and ‘Endaro Mahanubhavulu’ (Sri), all in Adi tala. The most famous of the group-singing sessions is the one that takes place at Tiruvaiyyaru during the Aradhana celebrations of the composer.

And yet, given Tyagaraja’s time span (1767-1847) and that of the Aradhana (from the early 20th century), this joint rendition is a relatively recent phenomenon. As per an article in the Adal Padal section of the Ananda Vikatan dated January 30, 1949, it was only in that year that the Aradhana’s organising committee hit upon the idea, as a means of getting all musicians to sing together.

On Aradhana day, Bangalore Nagarathnamma, the woman who had built the samadhi was asked to sing the 108 names of Tyagaraja that she had composed, as verse. This she did even as she performed the Kumbhaharati — the traditional right of the Devadasi. It was followed by Palladam Sanjeeva Rao playing ‘Chetulara’ on the flute. And then the assembled musicians sang the five songs in chorus. Today, Nagarathnamma’s ashtottarashatanamavali on Tyagaraja is forgotten, and the performance begins with the assembled flautists rendering ‘Chetulara,’ following which the Pancharatnam are sung.

Challenging Varali

The week leading to that first choral singing had seen hectic activity. Not all the musicians assembled knew all the songs. The Varali piece in particular posed a challenge given the taboo that existed on learning this raga directly from a guru.

It was Maharajapuram Viswanatha Iyer who found a way out. He sang the song from the first floor of a building. The assembled musicians sat a level below and followed him line by line, thereby overcoming the bar on learning songs in Varali directly.

This interesting anecdote was related to me by Tiruvaiyaru Chellam Iyer, a veteran of several Aradhanas, and who passed away last year at 100. Even today, while the remaining four are sung with gusto, ‘Kanakanaruchira’ has muted participation.

Were these songs really grouped together by Tyagaraja? It is very difficult to say ‘yes’ with certainty. And what exactly is meant by ‘ghana’ ragas? This term is given various interpretations and today, we follow Prof. Sambamoorthy’s explanation that these are ragas whose “individuality is brought out by playing madhyamakala (medium tempo) or tanam.”

Given the importance of tanam playing especially among vainikas, it is interesting to see that the concept of ghana ragas is more evolved among practitioners of that instrument.

In a later addition to the 17th century Chaturdandi Prakasika of Venkatamakhin, we see, according to Dr Premeela Gurumurthy’s monograph, The Ghana Raga Pancharatnas of Sri Tyagaraja, the first arrangement of eight ghana ragas — Nata, Gowla, Varali, Bowli, Sri, Arabhi, Malavasri and Ritigowla. Later, there is mention of a second set of five — Kedaram, Narayana Gowla, Salanga Nata, Ritigowla and Bowli. That the Tyagaraja school was quite familiar with this concept is buttressed by his disciple Veenai Kuppaiyyar’s varnam ‘Inta Kopa,’ which has pallavi in Nata, the anupallavi in Gowla, muktayi swaras in Arabhi and Varali, and the charanas sequentially in Sri, Narayanagowla, Ritigowla, Natakurinji and Kedaram. It is clear that while some ragas change in the set, the first five are constant.

But were the five songs ever intended to be sung together? They are not thematically united, unlike the ‘Kamalamba Navavaranam’ or even the Kshetra Pancharatnas that Tyagaraja composed at Srirangam, Lalgudi, Tiruvottriyur and Kovur. The songs vary in length and while the Nata piece is in Sanskrit, the rest are in Telugu. The Varali piece was relatively unknown and sung without the swara passages in concerts. In fact it is omitted altogether in Subbarama Dikshitar’s Sangita Sampradaya Pradarsini. In subsequent works such as Sangita Sudhambudi (1929), there is mention that the music of many charanas are unavailable.

In terms of structure too, the pieces, all excellent individually, have striking differences. There are also variations in the order of charanams as per some lineages of Tyagaraja’s disciples. The composer’s name appears three times in the Nata song, twice in the Sri piece and once in the others.

Their grouping was perhaps one of convenience. Historically it was the practice among musicians to sing their favourite pieces immediately after the Aradhana. That worked when just a few were present, or when the three factions in charge of the worship followed individual itineraries. Effective 1941, following the unification, this became difficult.

In 1942, we see the announcement that a Pancharatna kriti would be sung after the Aradhana. This was usually done in pairs. By 1949, the numbers necessitated choral singing and these five became the chosen songs. In retrospect, the choice was for the best.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/pq48sy/article30576546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17FRTYAGAARADHANA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-origin-of-pancharatna-kritis/article30576547.ece
231,2020/01/16,On a cultural mission,"“We were headed to the airport, on our way to Chennai, actually,” laughs mridangist Ravi M. Ravichandhira, referring to the family receiving the news of the Australia Council for the Arts recognising and assisting their concert tour of Chennai and Singapore from December 2019-January 2020. His dancer-wife, Narmatha, and sons, Sai-Nivaeithan and Sai-Sarangan, who are also trained mridangam artistes, simply smile. The timing couldn’t have been more apt: after all, the family had a packed Margazhi schedule.

Their 14th year performing in Chennai’s prestigious December season, the family of percussionist, all Guru Karaikudi Mani’s disciples, as well as dancer Narmatha, a disciple of Adyar K. Lakshman, couldn’t feel more honoured — to represent a large community of Australian artistes that supports a thriving Carnatic music and Bharatanatyam environment back home. Also Ravi considers it a testament to the service that the family has provided for years in Australia.

Community development

An organiser himself, Ravi has helped set up an institution for classical music and, with the support of his family, continues to develop the community while performing regularly. “The grant falls under the Australia Council’s International Strategic Funding Stream. Essentially, it allows us to perform and learn during our time in Chennai while also advocating for further growth in the arts and culture sector in Australia,” Ravi adds.

Like many other artistes living abroad, the family always looks forward to the Season. While they enjoy its many facets, one particular aspect stands out. “Meeting Mani Sir is the thing we look forward to the most,” Sai-Nivaethen beams. Brother Sai-Sarangan nods in agreement and says, “Of course, we also get the chance to attend so many concerts and be exposed to so much music that we can learn from.”

The enthusiasm is infectious, reminiscent of the attitude of many artistes who travel from far and wide to participate in Chennai’s Margazhi experience. Of course, the support of the Council adds an element of pressure for the family, but Ravi and Narmatha say the support motivates them to continue doing what they love.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/obuw4j/article30576408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17FRRAVI-AUSTRALIA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/on-a-cultural-mission/article30576409.ece
232,2020/01/16,Simple and short fare by Malladi Brothers,"How does one get immunity from fading popularity? Malladi Brothers know the secret recipe, whose principal ingredients are prudence, simplicity and humility. These terms were mentioned by prominent banker, Uday Kotak, who recently encased this mantra for successful banking today. And that holds for music too.

At their concert, Ramaprasad and Ravikumar kept the fare simple and easily digestible by a variety of audience (including the less initiated). Their prudence was brought out in their proportion slicing. There was a systematic change of flavour with the kritis and manodharma segments, each set in a finite time unit.

‘Sarasija nabha’ (Swati Tirunal, Khambodi, Ata) was elegantly rendered, with light punches coming from the sahitya in charanam. There were crisp swarams with good use of swaraksharam and kriti layam, but just to the prudent degree in ‘Sadachaleswaram’ (Bhoopalam, Dikshitar). Vasudevacharya’s ‘Mamahridaye’ (Ritigowlai) was perhaps too simple to make an impact.

The brothers’ best piece came in raga alapana of Pantuvarali (‘Vadera daivamu manasa’, Tyagaraja). The raga spans an ocean and there are prudent spoils for everyone’s style. Malladi brothers gambled with several varjyam phrases dropping especially panchamam, and sailed through the voyage cleverly – perhaps the only time they wandered from simplicity. Niraval and swaram at ‘Datru vinuthu’ had the team of Embar Kannan, Tiruchi Sankaran and Alathur Rajaganesh join and swell the atmosphere to a dazzle.

Replete with bhavam

The brothers take to bhavam like a duck to water. ‘Maragave’ (Sama, Tyagaraja) was a perfectly chosen and timed piece to cater to the emotional quarters of the audience. So was ‘Sivanai ninainthavar’ (Hindolam, Sivan), satisfying the Tamil aficionados.

There was more prudence in the raga alapana of ‘Mukhari’, staying to a diet course, while Embar Kannan got further in showcasing his manodharmam. ‘Emani ne’ (Subbaraya Sastri) is as much a gem as Tyagaraja’s many compositions in Mukhari. Malladi brothers tucked into the kriti poignantly. Their niraval at ‘Samaja Gamini’ and the swara segment that followed were neatly manicured. Their humility flashed throughout in sharing limelight equally with co-artistes and in nice references to their guru.

In another era, Maharajapuram Santhanam fashioned a similar theme for concerts and the parallel was apparent. Tukkadas, ‘Singara Moritivi’ (Kamas), ‘Govinda Sundara Mohana’ (Dwijawanti) and ‘Sarvam Brahma mayam’ (Jhinjoti) followed the same blueprint and brought a ‘feel good’ finish, just as Santhanam always did.

Embar Kannan is also a prudence-first violinist, keeping his interventions to short aesthetics and calibrating constantly to the mood and the tide. Tiruchi Sankaran is an invaluable asset to a concert and his strong musical instincts lifted the overall tempo, in a fine collaborative way. In the presence of stalwarts, Alathur Rajaganesh on the ganjira had a lean outing.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ctdfyp/article30576304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17FRMALLADI-PIC,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/simple-and-short-fare-by-malladi-brothers/article30576305.ece
233,2020/01/16,Are you a vintage Bollywood music trivia master? Join the RMIM group,"In the background score of Pakeezah, for a brief 40 seconds, a woman’s voice delivers a lovely rendition of Mehdi Hassan’s, ‘Dekh Toh Dil Ki Jaan’. Abhay Phadnis has replayed those 40 seconds again and again for 10 years — all in the hope of tracking down the singer, who was not mentioned in the film’s credits.

Such is the passion for vintage Hindi music among members of RMIM (rec.music.indian.misc), a global group of music aficionados. Their annual meet-up, this time in Chennai, is being organised by Adyar-based couple Abhay and Radha Rajagopalan.

“We are a group that is into Hindi music from the 1940s and ‘50s,” says Abhay. An understatement — RMIM members live and breathe musical trivia from the era, whether offline or over WhatsApp and Facebook groups.

Every year since 2006, the group has been meeting in Bengaluru, with people from Jaipur, Pune, Chennai as well as from the US and Dubai joining in. “Dr Guri Singh from Denver comes to India for three days every year, to attend this meetup,” says Abhay.

This is the second time that the meeting is being held in Chennai; the first was in 2007.

“It will be a two-day event, and we will have audio-visual quizzes, discussions and presentations. We will have one on the impact of a film director on its music. [Think Guru Dutt and Pyaasa],” he says.

Back to the beginning

The group was started in California in 1992 — an era pre-Google and YouTube — as a Usenet group: rec.music.indian. This discussion board had branches such as Classical, but it is the ‘misc’ group devoted to Hindi film music from the 1940s, that has stood the test of time. In the late 1990s, the Californians came up with the idea of meeting in person, to listen to music. Till today, the tradition continues twice annually — once in the East Coast, once in the West, according to Abhay. When a few of those NRIs returned to India in the early 2000s, it spread here.

“Back in the 1990s, we were getting new forms of media to listen through, and in the process we were losing out on some of the old songs. Everything could not be stored in a cloud like now. So having access to a lost treasure and sharing it in these meetups would be a sort of high,” says Abhay.

Today, with easier access to music, what gives bragging rights is a member’s knowledge on the subject of Hindi music — how well do you know your lyricists, singers, music directors and producers?

“We have intense fights in the groups, such as who was the greatest singer of the era. Some for whom Lata Mangeshkar is akin to goddess Saraswati, some who accuse the Mangeshkar sisters of having an unfair stronghold causing other deserving singers to lose out on jobs. Then we argue over which was the first song Majnu Sultanpuri had written… I know you’re thinking how it matters. But for us, it does!” he exclaims

This concern with accuracy is what makes the group stand apart from others. Many members have turned into resources for other biographers, and song collectors.

Speaking of which, it took Abhay 10 years but today he finally has the identity of the mysterious singer in Pakeezah. “Naushad did the background score (Ghulam Mohammad had passed away after recording the songs). His series of newspaper articles over the years was compiled in a book called Dastan-e-Naushad, in whose appendix was a list of every song he ever recorded.”

And so it was that Abhay found the singer’s name: Naseem Bano Chopra. “I loved her voice, but I loved this challenge even more.”

The RMIM meetup will be held at YWCA International Guest House, Vepery on January 18 and 19, starting at 11 am on Saturday. Open to all, call Abhay at 9840966825 or Radha at 9884066825.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/p3n1u/article30576269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPRMIM2019withSMjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/rmim-group-vintage-bollywood-music-trivia-master/article30576270.ece
234,2020/01/16,A refreshing Kharaharapriya by VV Subramaniam and team,"It was closest to ‘absolute music.’ There was vibrancy and variety in the concert by the Violin trio — V.V. Subramaniam, V.V. Ravi and V.V.S. Murari. The Kharaharapriya alapana proved the musical acumen of the trio. VVS commenced the alapana, followed by Murari and Ravi. The sancharas revealed subtle details of the raga with a rare freshness.

VVS commenced the tanam rather reluctantly, yielding to the wish of Murari and TVG. They brought the entire house to its feet with an exciting tanam, especially when a restive TVG joined in, in its closing passages. In Tyagaraja’s ‘Chakkani Raja,’ VVS brought forth his intellectual, technical and musical skills. He left a mark in each piece that he played. Sowkhyam ruled high in the swaraprastaras at ‘Kantiki Sundara,’ rendered by the trio taking turns.

T.V. Gopalakrishnan’s very presence added gravitas. The violinists and the audience must have enjoyed his accompaniment. His rhythmic flashes, after a long pause, with a crisp, well-shaped aruthi during the song, were eloquent. Being an accomplished vocalist, he knows how and where to give a meaningful pause. Pairing with V. Suresh, TVG packed the thani with rhythmic patterns. The sound of his teka, chapu and gumki was clear, sharp and bold. Suresh too provided glimpses of rhythmic excellence. His ghatam has a special melodic tone. After a Tisra Nadai Sankeerna Kuraippu, TVG presented the pharans and mohra in the routine chatusra nadai, concluding with a Tisra nadai korvai, eliciting appreciation from VVS.

Tiruppavai verse

The trio commenced their concert with the first Tiruppavai verse, followed by Tyagaraja’s ‘Sri Ganapathini’ (Sourashtram). ‘Angarakam Asrayamyaham’ (Surutti -Rupakam – Dikshitar) was rendered prefixed with a short alapana.

After a brief Varali alapana, the trio rendered ‘Mamava Meenakshi’ (Misra Chapu-Dikshitar). The Varamu delineation deserves special mention. One cannot but admire the gentle bowing of VVS, sparkling in the quick-moving passages. The three consistently communicated with one another musically, exchanging phrases with a degree of understandable intimacy. Tyagaraja’s ‘Manasuloni Marmamu’ was rendered in traditional purity, with swarams at pallavi. The concluding korvai saw the orchestral sound swelling to a crescendo.

After alapana in Vijayanagari they played Muthaiah Bhagavatar’s ‘Vijayambike’ and ‘Nannu kanna thalli’ of Tyagaraja in Kesari raga.

While VVS led all other raga delineations, Kuntalavarali alapana was presented by Ravi and Murari. The latter played a few fast-paced phrases. Maharaja Swati Tirunal’s ‘Bhogeendra Sayinam’ (Khanda Chapu) had swarams at pallavi.

The trio concluded the concert with ‘Karunai Deyvame’ (Sindhu Bhairavi- Madurai Srinivasan) and the traditional Mangalam, ‘Pavamana.’",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/fs5ary/article30576077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17FRVIOLINTRIO,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/a-refreshing-kharaharapriya-by-vv-subramaniam-and-team/article30576078.ece
235,2020/01/16,Packing the kritis with bhava,"Aishwarya Vidya Raghunath has many necessary traits like a pleasant voice, good programming instinct, fluent concert rhythm, mighty confidence and sustained energy that shored up her concert. Some elements though are work in progress.

A bright ‘Seethapathe namanasu’ (Kamas, Tyagaraja) provided an engaging early phase, with fast niraval and swarams at ‘Prema joochinapai’.

Following a succinct raga alapana of Varali, Aishwarya chose the classic kriti, ‘Karuna Joodavamma’ of Syama Sastri in Misra Chapu. The niraval at ‘Madhuravani Dharmasamvardini’ was placid but the handling of the kriti was matured. So was the Dikshitar piece, ‘Soundararajam’ in Brindavana Saranga.

Aishwarya packed in the vital bhavam and vilamba principles for a scholarly treatment. The mandatory speed variety was provided by ‘Kumaran thal’ in Yadukula Khambodi (Sivan).

Aishwarya’s Kharaharapriya was built on standard phrases and some twister brigas, but was bhavam-shy. Back to her kriti forte, her ‘Nadaci Nadaci’ had fine touches and enunciation. The swarams in Kharaharapriya were largely sarva laghu with minimum laya overlay. The Pallavi in Begada, ‘Damaruka hara gangadhara sankara’ had some complexity with the misra nadai kanta jathi Roopaka talam structure. Niraval, trikalam and swarams in three ragas – Begada, Hamirkalyani and Sankarabharanam brought out the best skills of Aishwarya and her ability to keep the concert vibrant throughout.

Violinist K.J. Dileep played a pleasing alapana of Kharaharapriya and exhibited laya control but stuck to routineness otherwise. Manjunath on the mridangam showed imagination in playing for the kritis though losing himself a bit in the trikala of the pallavi.

The tani avartanam — deft without loud thuds — with ghatam Trivandrum Rajesh was utilised to showcase their skills.

With attention to sruti alignment, facility beyond the 1 ½ octave range and encompassing intelligent layam where appropriate, Aishwarya could be on the next step of the ladder.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ocr07a/article30575947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17frAishwaryaVidyaRaghnathjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/packing-the-kritis-with-bhava/article30575948.ece
236,2020/01/16,Shashank and Ravikiran: Beauty of ragas reigned supreme,"When two child prodigies meet sparks will fly. Sharing the stage was not new for Chitravina Ravikiran and Shashank Subramanyam, but this was a no-holds-barred recital, while not giving in to gimmickry. Their idea was to complement rather than indulge in dizzy battle. Ravikiran displayed power and prowess both in raga excursions and interpretation of laya. Sarvalagu was still the hot favourite as against presenting swarakalpana for the thrill factor.

Sowkya and bhava ruled supreme in the RTP with the meeting of the minds of the two exponents. Shashank’s opening sedate strains of Sankarabharanam was a precursor of things to come as they launched into Swati Tirunal’s Ata tala varnam, ‘Chalamela.’ Sriranjani came next, revealed in the very first phrase from the flute, the raga’s beauty emerged effortlessly through a soulful alapana in which rishabha and madhayma played pivotal roles.

Ravikiran’s chitravina alternated, raising the complexity to a higher level with beautiful prayogas. Tyagaraja’s ‘Sogasuga’ captured the imagination.

Shashank and Ravikiran never let go of the raga’s melodic soul even while playing brilliant kalpanaswara kanakku. In ‘Ninnuvina’ (Purvikalyani), an inspired Shashank began with undulating soft phrases, while Ravikiran unfolded the raga’s aesthetics with long, powerful gamaka-laden, panchama-varja patterns. Both shared the raga’s beauty but did not miss to show their distinct abilities — Shashank on the tara sthayi shadja and Ravikiran’s phrases spanning more than two octaves. The kriti was replete with rakti prayogas, while the swarakalpana suite sparkled. They had time only for a brief Vagadheeswari RTP yet the two managed to play an alapana that captured the essence. The tanam was pure joy and was greeted with applause. The pallavi, ‘Vagadheeswari Bharati varija sambhava mohini vahini mamava’ by Ravikiran was set differently, the first half in Chaturashra gati and the second half in Chaturashra tisra. This let the two other wonderful artistes, Patri Satish Kumar (mridangam) and Shree Sunder Kumar (ganjira) convey the pallavi’s rhythmic intricacies during the tani.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/f57suc/article30575939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17frRavikiranShashankKGS11JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/shashank-and-ravikiran-beauty-of-ragas-reigned-supreme/article30575940.ece
237,2020/01/16,Sriranjani’s recital was all about quality music,"Sriranjani Santhanagopalan has shaped her own style with powerful musical aspects. Her concert was a clear evidence of her ascension to a higher order club. A moderate audience size did not deter her from delivering high quality music , with liberal doses of creativity and poise.

Viribhoni varnam is normally par for the course, but Sriranjani reformatted the charanam with different nadais in laghu and drutham parallel to the normal chatusra melody track. She chose to sing a concise but beautiful Pantuvarali ragam almost exclusively loaded with artistic phrases. The dasaru krirti, ‘Sada ninna hridayadalli’ had good niraval appendix at ‘Ninnananu viduvadalla’. A brightly rendered ‘Veena pustaka dharini’ (Dikshitar, Veghavahini) kept up the classical course.

Sriranjani’s Karaharapriya ragam was not too long and, yet fulfilling, covering the mid and the higher octaves with a non-cliché rendering. The tonal melody in the voice lent substantial beauty in this segment. Following ‘Pakkala Nilabadi’ (Tyagaraja), Sriranjani unleashed her strongest suite, a niraval at ‘Tanuvunche vandanamu’. With an assortment of rhythmic dissections and non-repetitive phrases, she stamped her leaning towards matured aesthetics. TP (yes, there was only a brief raga alapana) in Rishabhapriya came a bit late for detailed exposition but was enough to showcase Sriranjani’s range of skills. The pallavi ‘Sarigamapadani saptaswara Rishabhapriyam’ (Tisra tripuda, Balamuralikrishna) reinforced her collaborative skills. Her swara segments throughout the concert had the right quotient of mass strokes and duration. She clearly knew when to stop.

Violinist Anantha Krishnan had his prime moments in the Kharaharapriya alapana and niraval with his sweet bowing and succinct melody. Seasoned Arunprakash offered quiet support, choosing to let the spotlight fall on the vocalist most of the times. Anirudh and Arunprakash played an interesting tani mixing nadais into a Misra chapu structure.

Sriranjani went an extra mile in every rhythmic and melodic segment, offering a blend of musical depth and aesthetic presentation. The future of Carnatic music is secure in the hands of artistes like Sriranjani but it will be a pity if musical depth and crowds become mutually exclusive.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/jy73f/article30575909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17FRSRIRANJANI1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sriranjanis-recital-was-all-about-quality-music/article30575910.ece
238,2020/01/16,Kerala-based TechSariga Club lets you watch the music club’s concerts through its web app,"Imagine there’s a classical concert taking place far away that you just don’t want to miss. How about live-streaming the performance? Web application TechSariga Club lets you catch up with its concerts live from anywhere, thanks to its online music domain.

The inaugural show of ‘Beyond Live’ takes place on January 25 at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady, a Carnatic concert featuring vocalist Vishnudev Namboothiri, accompanied by Erickavu N Sunil (mridamgam), Edapally Ajithkumar (violin) and Vazhappally Krishnakumar (ghatam) that subscribers can watch online.

“The idea is to make music inclusive. While the ‘physical’ audience for the show will be students, teachers and some select invitees, music lovers can live-stream the performance on a device. It’s a fusion of technology and music,” says Kannan Govindan, founder of TechSariga Club that has over 300 members.

The website, that also has a “virtual studio” for musicians to collaborate online, offers add-on features such as discussion forums with and an audio-visual library. “The discussion platforms come with a user-friendly interface that can accommodate up to 25 participants at the same time, while music enthusiasts make use of the digital library with copyright-free content,” says Kannan, a mridangam player.

Other key features are “pre-event” and “post-event” content, as the former offers verified, introductory material about the kritis to be performed at an upcoming event apart from backgrounders about the artist and his music.

“We have a pool of contributory musicians who are members of TechSariga Club. Post-event content include highlights and analyses. For instance, in a two-hour-long concert, the wow moments might perhaps be just 30 minutes. Such segments are highlighted for the viewer,” says Kannan, adding that the web app, which was launched last July, is “responsive to any device.”

Another aspect is the option for interactions with an “expert panel” during the concert. “This is enabled through a chat option, and Q & A sessions also will be open,” says Kannan, a techie. Aluva-based TechSariga Club plans to organise at least one concert a month as a part of Beyond Live. However, web-streaming services is open to only registered club members. Subscription charges are ₹350 per month or ₹3,540 per year.

239,2020/01/16,Abhishek Raghuram’s unbridled creativity,"In every generation, there is at least one musician whose prowess is unique and whose concerts are outliers. This achievement has belonged to Abhishek Raghuram for a while now. His concert showed that some things have changed and some haven’t. His penchant for relentless multi-octave phrases in raga alapana, for instance is the same.

Mohanam and Kharaharapriya were his picks for full scale elaboration. The breathtaking rides are akin to what only an instrument can produce.

Absolute control of raga swaroopam and elegance added further layers for enjoyment.

‘Intha modi’ (Saranga varnam) declared that it was going to be an all-pace attack. ‘Ninne bhajana’ (Nattai, Tyagaraja) and ‘Sangita Gnamu’ (Dhanyasi, Tyagaraja) were good preludes to the brisk imaginative swaram segments following them.

‘Pari Pahimam’ (Swati Tirunal, Misra Chapu) in Mohanam is a rarely featured kriti and with its beautiful anupallavi, ‘Sarasija bhavanutha’ underlined Abhishek’s respect for good kriti structures. The kriti is as majestic as any that we have heard in the ragam. Abhishek’s niraval at ‘Sarasija’ had his hallmark creativity written all over it.

How he can traverse a ragam for over 20 minutes without a hint of repetition or unaesthetic element is part of Abhishek’s unbridled playbook.

Sivan’s ‘Srinivasa tava charanam’ suits his pace well and further Manodharama was unleashed in the niraval at ‘Kamalaja Manohara’. Abhishek stirred up Bhakthavatsam to provide him a good foil in the niraval.

Vittal Ramamurthy switched to a spinner role half-way through the concert, offering brief but gentle interventions in raga alapana and niravals. In the Kharaharapriya swaram, Abhishek opted to bowl from both ends, especially in the korvais.

The Pallavi was preceded by “Neevanti” (Varali, Spencer Venugopal) and Ennaga manasu (Neelambari, Tyagaraja). The concert element that has seemingly changed in Abhishek’s template is to have more kritis and time regulation. Yet, he was left with a short window to deliver a nice thanam but a rapid Pallavi in Mohana Kalyani (Misra chapu) with the words, “Ithu nalla samayam enai kaakka.” The aptness was not lost on the audience.

Tiruvarur Bhakthavatsalam ‘rattled’ away for most part of the concert. His tani was electric even though he almost forgot that he had to bring it to a close. Sree Sundar Kumar’s support was competent and more stately. Has Abhishek embraced streaks of conventionality in his concert or was this unintentional? Keep listening to know.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sgv46s/article30575820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17frAbhishekRaghuramjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/abhishek-raghurams-unbridled-creativity/article30575821.ece
240,2020/01/16,Ustad Zakir Hussain: Enjoying music of ‘God of tabla’,"‘Could you see Zakir Saheb?’ I overheard the voice of an exhilarated mother asking her son the moment the ‘God of tabla’ stepped on the stage, the pair of tabla-bayan in hand. As I turned back to look at them, I saw almost 3000 beaming faces along with theirs. The hall was jam-packed with ‘onlookers’ along with eminent musicians and genuine tabla-lovers. Even otherwise, Kolkata boasts of its latest craze – the solo tabla. It is a sure way to attract hoards of young musicians; as a result most soirees culminate with one. Someone as charismatic like Ustad Zakir Hussain and his solo is a magical combination for all concerned.

No wonder, even the tight security arrangements could not dissuade the fans when all roads led to Nazrul Manch, Kolkata, where Kajalrekha Musical Foundation, an initiative of tabla maestro Subhankar Banerjee, organised “Pranam”. Dedicated to the loving memory of his mother and mentor Kajalrekha Banerjee, this was the 20th annual presentation by his Taalsen Academy. As such, this had to be solemn and special.

Solemn mood

In keeping with the mood, the Ustad selected Rupak, with a pensive character highlighted by the ‘khaali’ right at the starting point of this seven-beat tala cycle. Supported by ace harmonium player Ajay Joglekar, the alaap like elaborations during his 35-minute-long peshkar, the Ustad apparently addressed students of serious music across all gharanas. Grounded firmly on the chosen tempo, it displayed umpteen varieties of rhythmic variants and bol-patterns. The faraway look of his eyes while weaving patterns were apparently focused at a point from where he could ‘see’ an entire universe of slow, slanting, swaying or running fractions between the two beats and his magical fingers etched their beauty through unparalleled nikas (execution) which gradually warmed up with thickly woven mnemonics and built the crescendo that ebbed with a tihai.

Next, each of his ‘kaida’ displays arrived with different aural effects emanating out of the aesthetic emphasis on a set of chosen bols, replete with numerical patterns, both in slow and fast tempi. Compositions by legends, including his father’s came with such clarity that one could feel the impact of raining pearls of different hues. Those who couldn’t, the master had something for them too!

The showman

From this point the showman in him took charge. To cast his spell and to entertain the lay listeners, he now created several stories such as ‘Traffic signal’, ‘Hiran ki chaal’ and ‘Damaru and Shankh’ around traditional compositions studded with diversely complex rhythmic designs. At the end of this one-and-a-half hour recital, a spontaneous and thunderous standing ovation greeted him because even a layman could understand that such wizardry was possible only due to an exemplary combination of dogged devotion to one’s art with unparalleled skill laced with ready wit and humour.

Disarming streak

Unlike most classical artistes, this disarming streak of Zakir Saheb’s persona brings him very close to his admirers. He blessed Subhankar, the devoted son of his Ma, by adapting the voice and mannerisms of a centenarian. It brought comical relief to a heavy emotional ambience.

Earlier, the evening commenced with ‘Chaturanga’, a well-coordinated musical presentation by a team of students of Taalsen Academy under the direction of gurus Subhankar and his vocalist wife Nibedita Banerjee. Apart from this melodic offering, the couple also paid tributes to their Ma, who nurtured a strong mind, loving heart and artistic temperament within her polio-stricken body, by distributing scholarships to physically challenged but talented music students and by handing over ‘Chhanda’ (special medical assistance card and priority health card sponsored by a reputed hospital) to one hundred musicians, represented by stalwarts like Tejendra Narayan Majumdar (sarod), Kushal Das (sitar), Chandana Chakraborty (principal, Shrutinandan) and Shrikanto Acharya (poplar singer).

Another heart warming endeavour of the Banerjees is to offer moral and monetary support to those veterans who were leading lights of their generations but are out of sight and out of mind now. This year a purse was offered to Pandit Chandrabhan Shrisunder.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/agrkzb/article30575314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17DFR1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ustad-zakir-hussain-enjoying-music-of-god-of-tabla/article30575315.ece
241,2020/01/16,The many facets of Hariprasad Chaurasia,"One of the most lovable musicians of our times, Padma Vibhushan Pt Hariprasad Chaurasia has not only taken the flute to the hitherto uncharted territory but is also a renowned composer, having created unforgettable immortal songs for several hit films. His musical partner was Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma, someone he says, “he can’t live without.” Unable to say no to any request, Pt Hari Prasad Chaurasia also has a wonderful sense of humour and an engaging informal persona that instantly puts one at ease.

His command of the flute, the novel techniques he introduced and the traditional dhrupad style “barhat” of the Senia Maihar tradition to which he belongs and what he popularised decades ago has led to a new generation of flautists.

In the wake of his new biography “Every Breath He Takes – Shadowing Hariprasad Chaurasia” by Sathya Saran, Hari ji opens up on his music and more.

Edited excerpts:

Tell us about the changes in the flute from the time it became your companion

The flute as an instrument is a complete one. It was perfect in Lord Krishna’s time and didn’t require structural changes to enhance it. I made no changes to it.

It was essentially still a folk instrument when I took it up. It was my Guru Annapurna Devi who brought about the changes that resulted in it being accepted in full as a complete instrument capable of bringing out every aspect of classical music. Her style was essentially a dhrupad style, with powerful meends and gamak. There was gravity and depth in the music that she taught me. Maine kya kiya, unhone karwaya. I was just the medium, she was the catalyst. I accepted her as a god. Whatever she said, I followed.

It is said that Annapurna ji insisted that you change even your hold of the bansuri, which you play as a left-handed player. Is this true?

This is a very personal matter, and I won't comment. But having said that, as far as I am concerned, when you have accepted your Guru as your God, then anything you are asked to do, has to be done. There has to be total complete surrender, only then can you imbibe.

Your third biography is here...

Every biographer has a different take. It’s like when one talks of the moon, someone may talk of its light, someone its beauty, a third on some other facet. So no two points of view are the same. Yes, this is the third book about me. Uma Vasudev wrote the first, (‘Romance of the Bamboo Reed’) then a Bengali writer Surajit Sen (‘Wood Winds of Change’) came up with his perspective. Now Sathya’s book examines my views on music. As I said, everyone comes with a different perspective, though my life is just one. There is so much I don’t talk about. For instance, once upon a time, I was a stenographer. Maybe that needs a fourth book!

Despite being such a wonderful composer, you have never created new ragas like many of your contemporaries did

There are so many ragas already there, if I try to give in to my creative urge and create a raga, who will be interested? If I try to add to the shine of the moon, how can I succeed? People will only comment, why did you even attempt this! There are so many ragas that one could spend three lives just exploring each one. But I must add, I don’t say that those who create new ragas are wrong.

Tell us more about your unique partnership with Pt Shiv Kumar Sharma

Bas, ho gaya! It just happened. God wanted us to work as a team and I would like it to continue. Nahi to pati patni mein jhagare ho jaate hain. Our relationship has been for so long; there has never been strife. Think of it, he is from Jammu, I am from Allahabad, we connect in Bombay….prem ho gaya dil se. We are like two sons of a mother; we can’t live without each other.

It is said you love the two institutions of teaching music that you have set up like your own children.

True. My two Gurukuls that I established myself on my own, in Odisha, the place where I started my musical career from, and Mumbai where I live are very dear to me. Much as I love teaching, I could not accept a teaching assignment at the Bengal Foundation School in Dhaka due to my commitment to these two schools. It was just God’s will that the two got established. Underprivileged children stay at my Gurukuls free of cost, and learn with full concentration.

I have received so much love and respect from everyone, but I am aware, ki khali haath aaye the, khali haath jaana hai. What I will leave behind is my music.

What would you like to tell emerging musicians?

In our lives, we focus on our health too much. I, sometimes, think one should just live without care. To students of music I say, devote more time to your music, approach it with an attitude of prayer, not only will you gain knowledge, but you will also gain as a musician.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/jedhsl/article30575252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17DFRPANDITHARIPRASADCHAURASIA,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-many-facets-of-hariprasad-chaurasia/article30575253.ece
242,2020/01/16,PT petitions Collector over water scarcity at Infopark,"Progressive Techies (PT), a combine of Information Technology employees having a presence in all IT parks in the State, has petitioned the District Collector over the worsening water shortage that has taken its toll on the functioning of Infopark.

The petition submitted on Thursday sought immediate intervention by the collector to address the pressing need. Petitions have also been sent to the Chief Minister’s office and K.B. Ganesh Kumar, chairman of the Assembly committee that directed that tanker lorries supplying water should collect water only from hydrants and other supply points of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA).

“While the direction was in right spirit, Infopark seems to have turned an inadvertent victim of it as the water shortage has kicked in with the fall in the quantity of water supplied through the tanker lorries. So acute is the problem now that some of the companies have asked their employees to work from home,” said Aneesh Panthalani, president, PT, while warning that the situation would turn even grim if the supply of water was not to improve in the coming days.

Though the water scarcity had been felt for the last few days, it especially turned worse during the last couple of days. Infopark, which hosts around 40,000 employees spread over 250 companies, needs nearly 20 lakh litres of water a day and depends on tanker lorries to supply most of it.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pt-petitions-collector-over-water-scarcity-at-infopark/article30579056.ece
243,2020/01/16,Petitions against landassignment dismissed,"A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday dismissed two writ petitions against the assignment of surplus land surrendered by the Malabar Produce and Rubber Company at Ambayathodu in Thamarassery to landless poor.

The petitions were filed by the company and Baby Oommen Thomas, a shareholder of the company. According to the petitioners, the land surrendered by the company could be assigned only in public interest and the encroachers on the land were not entitled to the assignment.

Meanwhile, disposing of a petition filed by 106 persons, the court asked them to file applications seeking assignment of land before the District Collector. The court made it clear that it shall be open for the collector to consider the same and pass appropriate orders.

The court dismissed their plea for a declaration that they were entitled to get the land assigned in their favour. The court said that it was for the competent authority to consider the claims of the petitioners and take a decision.

244,2020/01/16,Gender games,"A fairly new theatre group from Bengaluru, the Big Fat Company (BFC), arrives in Mumbai this week with their new show, Name The Game. This is only their second production after the Hayavadana-inspired Head 2 Head, a play that attracted attention not only because of its spirited and unapologetically plus-size ensemble, but also its subversive if self-referential take on an age-old tale that pits physical beauty with intelligence as ostensibly indelible markers of identity. The BFC was formed by 2017 by theatre practitioners who wanted to challenge conventional aesthetics, including but not limited to body size.

Freedom to experiment

Their new devised play is a collaboration between writer Shreekanth Rao and performer Anuradha HR, and treads along similar lines, but expands the turf to include compelling new contexts of gender and caste by unearthing an ancillary tale from the Mahabharata – that of Hidimba (also called Hidimbi in some versions of the epic), the so-called ‘demoness’ consort of Bhima. Its blurb reinforces a Brechtian notion of sorts, “The idea of using such archetypal tales stems from the fact that [these] stories afford [psychological] distancing and therefore [engage] the audience without the emotional baggage of personal experience.” The project is supported by Zubaan Books’ Stepping Stones project, an endeavour that seeks to utilise theatre, art or poetry to create open, transformatory dialogues with the youth on understanding structures of sexual violence and impunity. “Mythology also gives us a lot of freedom to play around with perspectives,” says Anuradha, who felt that several aspects of Hidimba’s story resonated with BFC’s area of interest of challenging gender stereotypes of body image. For instance, Hidimba’s transforming herself into a celestially beautiful woman in order to woo Bhima. “The way we gaze at gender has a direct bearing on gender-based violence,” explains Anuradha.

In its current version, Name The Game is roughly a 30-minute performance that is followed by an interaction with the audience, in keeping with the Stepping Stones brief. The makers have kept the work deliberately unresolved, hoping its work-in-progress feel will allow a feedback loop to be activated with audiences. “We are developing it into an hour-long performance that will include Bhima’s situation as well. When the perspectives open up, grey areas get highlighted,” emphasises Anuradha. This feeds into BFC’s commitment to being gender-neutral — one of their projects deals with the objectification of men on dating apps.

Keeping it relevant

Depicted invariably as a bronzed persona with a brawny physique, Bhima seems caged in equally self-limiting ways, as echoed in the culture of masculine narcissism that is clogging social media these days. Anuradha will take on the parts of both Hidimba and Bhima in the extended version. Even now, the constant shifts between persona and self in a piece in which she speaks directly to the audience has been enriching to her as a performer. “Placing my body into the performance as a plus-size person was also a key point of interest and challenge,” she says.

The piece was initially called Hidimba, after its beleaguered protagonist, but as Anuradha explains, the makers felt that, “The performance is more about the larger constructs of what dictates what Hidimba or Bhima do.” They seemed like unwitting players in a much more insidious game of gender and hierarchies, which is what is signified by the title of the play. As Rao explains, “Discovering the game and its rules, which pervades the Mahabharata, gives us insight in how we might adapt to it in real life.”

Different interpretations of the epic give us different outcomes to Hidimba’s story after Bhima left (returning years later only to claim son Ghatotkacha). In a Kannada version, she takes on several partners, not bound to the rules of a game that a Draupadi or Subhadra might find themselves tethered to. This agency is something that Rao wanted to tap into in Name the Game.

Hidima (Name the Game) will be staged on January 17 at Harkat Studios at 7.30 p.m. and January 18 at Piroja Studio at 7 p.m. (check Facebook)",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/vmga6r/article30578150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG9050,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/gender-games/article30578151.ece
245,2020/01/16,Those hilarious in-laws,"Inner Laws was written by Poile Sengupta, an award-winning playwright, way back in 1994. Even after so many years, the play continues to have a universal appeal. The play will be staged once again in the city.

Theatre for Change and Urban Chaupaal will stage Inner Laws, directed by Devasish Singhal. The play is a satirical sit-com, revolving around five mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law. Theatre actor and teacher/counsellor Sujatha Balakrishnan, founder of Theatre for Change, says she was familiar with the play much earlier. And the theme of the mother-in-law and daughter intrigued her. “When I was doing my masters in psychology in the early 2000s, I read psychoanalyst Sudhir Kakar’s The Inner World, which goes beyond the clichéd mother-in-law and daughter-in-law relationship. In the book, he writes about the ‘maternal enthralment theory’, which is about the mother-son relationship in Indian families. He writes that this theory revolves around how the son looks upon the mother as an authoritarian position. This relationship affects the mother-daughter-in-law relationship and other relationships,” says Sujatha, who does theatre that addresses social issues.

Sujatha decided to stage Inner Laws as it is a rib-tickling comedy, which has a positive message. “The content of the play is fabulous. It is a laugh riot. Only a few characters have mythological names, such as Mrs Vasudev, Mrs Nandan, and Mrs Dasrath. One of the mothers-in-law, Mrs Hrimaan (essayed by me) and her daughter-in-law Lavanya play the role of reformers. When the play begins there is chaos, but it ends on an optimistic note that mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law can be the best of friends.”

She adds: “The play is divided into four acts. It is peppered with mock heroic acts. Poile was inspired by Rape of the Lock, Alexander Pope’s mock-heroic narrative poem. The daughters-in-law and the mothers-in-law are in combat, but the main bone of contention is the son of the house, even though they fight over trivial things.”

Sujatha says she was in constant touch with Poile over the course of putting the play together. “She is ahead of her times,” she says.

Sujatha says they had an audition and a cast of 10 were chosen. “It took us four months to put the play together. We had intense rehearsals as comedy is difficult. A little bit of background helped the actors to get into character.”

Devasish says: “The project was initiated by Sujatha. We thought we would read a couple of scripts and we would stage it. We had a reading. And everyone got excited reading the script”

He adds: “It is easy to associate feminism to a play with only women characters. For me however, this is a pseudo way of looking at it. I think it is an interesting play. I really liked the dynamics of the relationship among all the characters.”

Inner Laws will be staged on January 18 at Alliance Francaise. There will be two shows: at 4 pm and 7 pm. Tickets are available at the venue and bookmyshow and are priced at ₹250.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/c11xmr/article30576189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bgmsujathabalakrishnanandinnerlawscastjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/those-hilarious-in-laws/article30576190.ece
246,2020/01/16,Bengaluru Nagarathnamma: An extraordinary woman,"“Tribhuvanae... ae… ae… ae…” the way Bengaluru Nagarathnamma sings the ‘Mukunda Mala’ stothram (available on YouTube), is rather different.

The rendition is in a higher octave, stronger and the lines are sharply cut with less gamakam. The play ‘Vidyasundari Bengaluru Nagarathnamma,’ premiered at the Chowdiah Memorial Hall in Bengaluru recently, begins with Pusthakam Ramaa singing almost in the same tone but with softer lines and gamakas reflecting contemporary Carnatic music.

It is the Samadhi of Saint Tyagaraja that the audience face when the curtain goes up. Two groups — Peria Katchi and Chinna Katchi — are fighting over the conduct of Tyagaraja aradhana. Bengaluru Nagarathnamma enters with several devadasis and conducts her own Aradhana.

Young Bannibai (later a Harikatha legend), who was adopted by Nagarathnamma, is introduced. The Aradhana pulls a crowd but is cut short by a fire started by a jealous miscreant.

‘Vidyasundari Bengaluru Nagarathnamma’ is a musical produced by Sangeeta Sambhrama in Kannada with Tamil and Telugu (also English) dialogue, where required, directed by eminent theatre and movie director Nagabharana. Pusthakam Ramaa has composed the music. Taking inspiration from V. Sriram’s The Devadasi and the Saint: The life of Times of Bengaluru Nagarathnamma and the Kannada novel Vidyasundari of Maleyuru Guruswamy, the play has been adapted by Prathibha Nandakumar and Hooli Sekar.

The script moves fast — touching the milestones — the life of young Nagarathna in Nanjanagudu near Mysore, her education in languages and music, her mother Puttalakshamma falling into penury, the move to Bengaluru, the death of her mother, the musical prowess of Nagarathna, the meeting with judge Narahari Rao, who became pivotal to her rise, the Diwan (Pulikeshi Kasturi, who is also the choreographer), who advises Narahari Rao to not take the official carriage and an uniformed attendant to meet Nagarathna, the building of a house for Nagarathna on a small hillock that Narahari names Mount Joy, which eventually comes to be known as Narahari Raya’s gudda, the break up of the couple and the reunion with Nagarathna singing the javali ‘Maathaada baarade...?’ (won’t you talk to me?). Young Nagarathna and Narahari were enacted with involvement and empathy by Ananya Bhat and Nitin.

Then comes Nagarathna’s move to Madras, the friendship with Veena Dhanammal (Nagini Bharana), the accumulation of wealth, building of a huge house, inviting her guru Bidaram Krishnappa (Vageesh Krishna) to sing Kannada songs in Madras, coyness giving way to confidence and strength, (essayed with authority by Deepthi Srinath).

Nagarathna visits Tyagaraja Samadhi in Tiruvaiyaru for the first time and is dismayed to find it in a state of disarray. She cleans it up and decides to build a new one. In order to do that she sells her jewellery and house (she exchanges her fertile land for a barren plot to build it).

The climax shows her final resting place in front of the samadhi. Her story is sung in a gripping Harikatha style, embellished with great music. P. Ramaa makes a dignified senior Nagarathnamma.

Some artistic licence seems to have been taken in the depiction of the friendship between Nagarathnamma and Veena Dhanammal. Was Dhanammal present when Nagarathnamma went to see the Samadhi of Tyagaraja for the first time? Did she dance?

Nagarathnamma’s famed sense of humour could have been highlighted too. Some glitches were noticed in the sets, which can easily be rectified in the future. This is the story of an extraordinary woman, told with quality dance and music combining dramatic production values.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/7lhw4z/article30575906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17frNagarathnamma2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/bengaluru-nagarathnamma-an-extraordinary-woman/article30575907.ece

The 12th International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK 2020), organised by Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi (KSNA), from January 20 to January 29 at the Akademi campus in Thrissur, focusses on the theme of ‘Imagining communities.’ Amitesh Grover, festival director, says the event is “an attempt to disrupt imagined communities by reassembling histories, performing new alignments and calling forth new communities.”

Apart from works from India, the ITFoK 2020 is set to showcase 19 plays from six countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, Iran, Brazil, Norway and Poland. Perhaps, the highlight of this edition is the presence of renowned performer-director Professor Phillip Zarrilli, Emeritus Professor of Performance Practice at Exeter University in the UK. Phillip, whose play Told by the Wind is part of the schedule, will also present ‘Master Keynote’ on ‘Embodied consciousness’.

The seven plays that are part of the ‘International Section’ explores themes of defiance, unrest and forced migration.

Brazilian play Silver Epidemic, directed by Georgette Fadel for Compahnia Mungunza da Teatro, also the opening act of the festival, is inspired by the ‘silver boys’ who paint themselves and perform jugglery at traffic lights in Sao Paulo. It looks at the lives of addicts and the homeless in the Brazilian city.

Mythological tale

Polish play Tree of Death, directed by Stanislaw Dembski for Pijana Sypialnia Theatre, takes its subject matter from the Polish myth of the magic pear tree in which Lady Death was imprisoned. Australian play The Director also centres on the theme of death and ventures into the taboo topic of the ‘death industry’. The play’s director, Lara Thomas, teams up with a former undertaker, Scott Turnbull, for the performance.

In An Evening with Immigrant from the UK-based Fuel Productions, Inua Ellams, an immigrant poet of Nigerian origin, shares with the audience his poetry and memories from his displacement from Nigeria during his childhood to escaping death threats. I Is Another – Rimbaud in Africa, directed by Lars Oyno for Grusomhetens Theatre (Theatre of Cruelty), Norway, explores some unknown facets of the French poet Arthur Rimbaud who spent the latter half of his life as a merchant in Africa, selling coffee and guns. This is the second time Grusomhetens Theatre is participating in the ITFoK, the first was in 2013 with the play The Last Song.

Mostafah Koushki, Iranian director whose Midsummer Night’s Dream was part of last year’s festival, is here with another Shakespearean adaptation, Coriolanus, for Mostaghel Theatre Company. Told by the Wind, created by Kaite O’Reilly, Jo Shapland and Phillip Zarrilli for Llanarth Theatre, UK, is a piece of inter-cultural, post-dramatic theatre developed as a research project.

The ‘National Section’ includes six plays from Hyderabad, Bhopal, Bangalore, Pune, Jaipur and Goa. The highlight is Abhishek Majumdar’s Eidgah ki Jinnat, the performance of which was disrupted in Jaipur by a right-wing fringe group. The play deals with the plight of Kashmiris, which is depicted through the lives of two orphaned siblings. Kala Dhabba Badal Ki Tarah Aa Rahe Hai is an experimental work directed by Avijit Solanki, a graduate from the National School of Drama (NSD) for Other Theatre, a Bhopal-based alternative theatre group.

Light-hearted take

Hindi play Salma Deewani, also from another NSD graduate Bhagyasree Tarke, for The Atre Company, takes a light-hearted look at the mundane life of a lonely Hyderabadi woman who is also a die-hard Salman Khan fan. It attempts to explore the lives of women living within conservative structures. Chaheta (The Beloved), from Pune-based contemporary theatre group Aasakta Kalamanch and directed by Mohit Takalkar, talks about Abraham and his son, a common story in three religions – Islam, Christianity and Judaism.

Avyahat (in Marathi) from Hauns Sangeet Natya Mandal, Goa, is an adaptation of Goan writer and architectural historian Amita Kanekar’s novel A Spoke in the Wheel. Written by Kausthubh Naik and directed by Rohan Naik, the play portrays the story of Upali, the Buddhist monk commissioned by Emperor Asoka to write the biography of Gautama Buddha.

No Rest in the Kingdom, from Bengaluru-based Sandbox Collective and directed by Deepika Arwind, is a physical theatre performance that looks at the female performer’s body “as a site of protest.”

The Malayalam segment showcases six plays — Old Man and Sea, an adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway-classic by Sasidharan Naduvil for Remembrance Theatre Group, Thrissur; Chillara Samaram, written by MP Rajesh and directed by Arun Lal for Little Earth School of Theatre, Malappuram; Veendum Bhagavante Maranam, a theatrical adaptation of K R Meera’s short story directed by Hazim Amaravila for Kanal Samskarika Vedi, Thiruvananthapuram; Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavum, an adaptation of a short story by Paul Zacharia and directed by Suveeran for Backstage Vadakara; Bombay Sketches, written by Keli Ramachandran and directed by Prashanth KN for New Bombay Keraleeya Samaj, Mumbai; and Cherala Charitham, directed by Sajith KV for Nataka Sangham, Kongad, Palakkad.

Apart from the staging of plays, the ITFoK 2020 has additional ‘platforms’ — performance poetry, films on theatre and seminars and the Master Talk.

Performance poetry is co-curated by Sudheesh Kottempram and MR Vishnuprasad, while films on theatre will present a selection of six national and international films that document certain performance practices that are dying out.

Apart from Phillip Zarrilli’s Master Keynote, there are three seminars focussing on ‘Theatres of migration and war,’ ‘Theatres of emergency,’ and ‘The secular in performance traditions.’

248,2020/01/16,“Daughters Opera”: Staging feminist solidarities,"A tableau of women greets the audience with distant stares. Fluttering notes on the cello segue into a furious melody as a container with the actors rolls towards the audience. As the performance unfolds, visual impressions and vignettes from everyday life present women’s experiences of violence in a play that embraces text, choreography and opera as intellectual inquiries.

A first of its kind, the première of the inter-cultural Australian and Indian opera project, ’Daughters Opera’ at Black Box Okhla, Delhi, brought together multiple genres to a music score by David Chisholm. Theatre director Anuradha Kapur and producer and librettist Tammy Brennan describe the contemporary inter-genre work as a project in progress rather than a finished art product.

The prelude

Anuradha Kapur

A dialogue began brewing between the theatre makers when Brennan was visiting India for a performance in 2012-13, at the Bharat Rang Mahotsav curated by Kapur. “There were big protests against violence against women during that time in Delhi and it was quite shocking that such brutal acts of violence were still happening, not just here but throughout the world.” Travelling with her four-year old daughter, Brennan recounts responding differently to the protests following the Nirbhaya rape, “I reacted as a mother. From that standpoint I felt what kind of world is my daughter growing up in?” Researching more deeply into what sorts of gender violence and why is it still happening in the 21st century, became the common denominator for the two artists.

Skipping back to the initial conversations, Kapur says, “The conceptual stitch for us was, how do you find the language to talk about gender violence – from the extreme to everyday? We didn’t want to do a show just around Nirbhaya because that becomes restricted to what happened to one woman. Apart from the extreme violence of certain events, I was interested in relating the everyday violence which we so often forget to talk about.”

Violence is never shown explicitly or directly in the play. It is tangentially indicated, subtly evoked through text, movement and visuals. Raging contemporary issues like migration, living and dying in a container, lower wages, labouring bodies and oppressed voices are presented as montages rather than a singular narrative, often accompanied by text extracts, for instance from Kumkum Sangari’s “Solid Liquid”. The choreography by Victoria Hunt and scenography by Deepan Sivaraman deepen the visual impact. The flow evades emotional intensity, anchoring instead on formalistic experiment and pointed political statement.

The process

Brennan is an activist-artist and her works have explored the opera, challenging the classical structure with contemporary human rights issues. “Opera is known for being a cross-art form that has everything from music to movement, yet it is also a form that needs to broaden up with more experimentation. I feel, the libretto, the narratives of opera, have been very passive and subjugate women in a way that reinforce a certain cultural conditioning. I am interested in changing those narratives and presenting them on the stage so that the voices of women have agency.”

Sharing their collective journey of collaborating, the artists mention that the dramatic stitch takes off from an ancient Greek drama by Aeschylus, “The Suppliant Women” about fifty women escaping forced marriage. While discussing this play, they came across the two prime thematic strands for “Daughters Opera”. “The play is about violence and migration. We haven’t got back to that play, but it stitched the two narratives together that are the foundation for our production,” says Kapur.

She describes the directorial vision as, “A process that was a layering of several imaginations – the libretto, choreography, scenography.” The performers spent a month working with Victoria Hunt, the choreographer. “She has a very specific language and systems,” points out Brennan. “The way the actors move defines the relationship between the music, space and bodies.” The postures, movements, gestures glue together disconnected images. Depictions from everyday life flow into unanticipated interruptions. Accompanying the varied settings, these moments range from delight as a labourer woman breaks into a dance to the libretto rhythm, to horror at a sudden guttural scream, or quiet discomfort as the actors perform a slow crawl across the stage. The work is not structured to be emotionally immersive. It is intellectually engaging and evocative.

Projecting forward

The performance reveals the process of a work in progress and evades being a finished product. Kapur clarifies, “It is more about bringing the process inside out, it is a proposition.” After much discussion, the team decided not to have a curtain call at the end of the play to mark this position. “If you have a curtain call it means you have produced something as a product, but maybe you haven’t.” Similarly, there was much debate about where to stage the play, finally choosing an experimental studio space (Black Box Okhla) over a grand theatre. “We did not want to be in a formal auditorium that produces a certain kind of visual that is too comfortable and difficult to break. Different spaces make different relationships.”

Both Kapur and Brennan, as theatre makers and critical thinkers, have strong political voices. This work is positioned pointedly within their individual oeuvres. “‘Daughters Opera’ for me sits within an ongoing series of works, that respond to how women experience gender violence and trauma,” remarks Brennan. For Kapur, the production takes forward her quest, “my point of concern is to find the language to talk about everyday and extreme violence, to explore propositions of articulation through theatre.”

Emphasising that “Daughters Opera” is an ongoing project, the artists agree that the dialogue must expand. Positioned as a live action work, it would tour, bringing in new voices and contexts, going ahead with a core ensemble and including women’s voices and narratives from the people and places that it travels to.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/27yzjc/article30574938.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Daughters-Opera-at-Black-Box-Okhla5,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/daughters-opera-staging-feminist-solidarities/article30574941.ece
249,2020/01/16,I make the audience complicit in my art: Amitesh Grover,"Amitesh Grover is one of those young theatre practitioners of India who have transcended the barriers of disciplines to journey with the spectator through a meditative, intimate experience. A recipient of Ustad Bismillah Khan National Award, Amitesh is festival director of the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK), which is themed on ‘Imagining Communities’. In an email interview, Amitesh, assistant professor at the National School of Drama, talks to FridayReview about the festival, its theme and the theatre scene today.

What is your vision of ITFoK this year?

The plays included this year bring profoundly moving narratives, complex subjective and artistic authorship that present an opportunity to scrutinise not only the shifting political implications of our world, but are also an interrogation of the relationship between art and community. The year 2019-2020 is significant for people’s movement in India. Through multiple and spontaneous protests across the country, the notion of the public has been expanded from a geographical scope of India as a territory, to a constitutional proposition — what is the idea of India?

ITFoK 2020 stands witness to a ‘change of heroes’, from an individual to a collective, from one person in the crowd to the crowd itself, from one leader for the many to the many who are leading together today.

Your works freely flow between the genres of performance, art, digital media, installations...

My work occupies the intermediate space between theatre, performance and interactive art. I have created work on Grief, on Sleep, on Happiness, and on several other ephemeral grounds of knowledge. My work has a strong orientation towards experiencing philosophy-in-performance. I have been developing a practice of intimate performance.

I have been interested in how the conditions of intimacy shape time, labour, technology, and art. I build my work by deploying myself in several capacities and roles — that of an imposter, observer, guest, director, interviewer, coder, worker, writer, pedagogue, researcher and artist.

I spend extensive time researching and immersing myself in a site/location/context, learning a new routine, an alien body vocabulary. And when I think I am ready, I begin to insert intimate gestures and performances in the environment, which sometimes leave a residue in the form of photographs, film or live art.

During previous research phases, I have collaborated with scientists, philosophers, hackers, gamers, politicians, stock-brokers, cleaners and so on. For instance, my year-long work on the phenomenon of sleep clamours after the ineffability of ‘downtime’ as an everyday experience, even as my work on mourning engages with the volume of disappearance and loss. I engage non-artists in my work as a way to rethink subjectivities, artistic ownership and friendship, to reflect upon shared fields of silence, subversion and resistance.

How did the exposure at the University of London (UAL) mould your contemporary understanding of theatre?

At UAL, I had colleagues from all over Asia, Africa, and Europe. My colleagues came from a broad range of practices, from architecture, film-making, fashion, puppetry and performance. I shared studio space with painters, sculptures and graphic artists.

You can imagine what a spectacularly fertile ground this can be for all manner of experimentation.

To support my scholarship, I worked as a intern at The Barbican and The Battersea Arts Centre, as a cleaner and backstage worker. My daily tasks entailed mopping and cleaning the stage and the green rooms, and getting the auditorium ready for the evening show, and putting everything back in order after the show ended. This gave me free access to the works of great masters like Robert Lepage, Peter Brook, Tim Etchells, and many many more, from the wings, in exactly the same manner as I learnt from great masters like Habib Tanvir in India while preparing for their shows as a volunteer worker. I was in London for nearly two years, and the immersion and exposure to various art forms and practices helped me identify with cultural sensibilities on a global scale.

How does the digital space excite you as a performance maker?

In an attempt to comprehend the rapidly colliding worlds of our times, I find that the digital space is a liminal state, a state lying in-between — between chaos and order, between real and fictional. The digital is a space embedded with memories, associations, links, authenticity, anonymity, fantasy and falsity. It is not possible to keep all these worlds separated online.

Of course, these associations could lead one anywhere, force one to make unexpected connections; but this is the unpredictability on which digital theatre relies for its existence.

I make the audience complicit in my art — the viewer is my collaborator, and also a participant. I propose that the viewers are themselves a site of performance. In my work, performers/audiences and technology is uncomfortably near, speaking directly, implicating everything and everybody into the performance. The audience is impelled to respond, because they are being addressed, and they can affect the way the performance progresses. It is a moment of immense responsibility and power. Audience members can watch other members too, and the experience becomes more real.

At the NSD, as a teacher, what are the new discourses you encounter with new theatre practitioners?

Teaching art and performance has significantly changed in the 21st century. The teacher is no longer the provider of information, because information is freely available online.

Teaching spaces are no longer organised along the lines of old hierarchies — gurus/shishya or other traditionally established arrangements. We have had to re-make the processes and tools with which we teach art and performance.

One significant shift that I have noticed in my approach to teaching now is the emphasis on the relationship between theory and practice, between thinking and doing. Art institutions’ privileged practice and the training curriculum was predominately shaped to produce the practitioner of art in the past, with little or no valence given to reading, writing, or the philosophy of art. But this approach has been significantly questioned and revised now, and many teachers in my generation are encouraging students to think about their practice in multi-modal ways, and to inculcate habits of thinking, reading, and doing as artistic practice.

253,2020/01/16,Minister promises support to those excluded from LIFE Mission scheme,"Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan on Thursday said the possibility of constructing houses for those earlier excluded from the list of beneficiaries under the LIFE (Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment) Mission scheme would be considered separately by the State government.

Opening a district-level meet on LIFE Mission scheme beneficiaries at here, Mr. Ramakrishnan said strict guidelines were set for the project as it was mandatory for implementing any such government-funded initiative. “It doesn’t mean that those who could not fulfil the norms are ineligible for such supportive aid. Their concerns will be addressed through appropriate measures,” he affirmed.

According to Mr. Ramakrishnan, the State government would be striving to accomplish the dream of all homeless people within a few years and about two lakh houses would be completed across the State by the end of this month. He said the scheme had already achieved the target of completing 13,394 houses in Kozhikode district alone.

“The next phase of LIFE Mission is to construct residential complexes for the homeless people. Across the State, 56 residential complexes will come up,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan. The tendering process of 10 projects had been completed, he said.

Lauding the cooperative sector for its role in realising the dream of homeless people, the Minister said about 4,000 people who lost their houses in the recent rain and landslips had been assured new houses by the cooperative movements. They were all supported by various voluntary organisations, political parties and local self-government bodies, he recalled.

District panchayat president Babu Parassery chaired the inaugural event which also honoured the best performing local bodies in implementing various LIFE Mission projects. V.K.C. Mammad Koya and A. Pradeepkumar, MLAs, gave away the prizes.

A meeting of the State office-bearers of the party held here on Thursday felt that the police were rampantly registering cases against CAA protesters in all the districts. Non-bailable charges were foisted on the agitators in many cases. The protests were carried out in a peaceful manner without any destruction to public property. It seemed the police were trying to weaken the anti-CAA stir in Kerala where the protest is strong.

The State government declared that it had halted NPR data collection. But a circular purportedly by Thamarassery Tahsildar on data collection showed the shortcoming of the government, the meeting said.

255,2020/01/16,Vigilance court orders reprobe against Sooraj,"The Kozhikode Vigilance Inquiry Commissioner and Special Judge has ordered a reinvestigation against former District Collector and PWD Secretary T.O. Sooraj into alleged financial irregularities in the purchase of equipment at Government General Hospital (Beach hospital) here.

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) had registered an FIR in 2007 against Mr. Sooraj , who was the District Collector when the purchase of equipment to the tune of ₹68 lakh was made for the World Bank-funded Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) project in Kozhikode.

The others who were named in the FIR were RCH project officer Dr. M. Vijayan; SIDCO (Kerala Small Industries Development Corporation Limited) Manager M.G. Sasidharan, and Oriental Surgicals managing partner T.M. Vasudevan.

A preliminary inquiry of the VACB then had found that the State exchequer had suffered a loss of ₹34 lakh following the purchase of the equipment. However, the VACB had removed the names of Mr. Sooraj and Dr. Vijayan, who were arraigned second and first accused respectively in the FIR, when the charge sheet was filed in the court in 2012.

Special Judge K.V. Jayakumar ordered a reinvestigation in the case after the remaining accused had moved a discharge petition seeking to quash the charges against them.

The court, while observing that the probe was not conducted in a fair and impartial manner, pointed out that the VACB had not given a clarification why both the first and second accused were let off in the case. Investigators had also failed to bring the real facts before the court, it said.

The VACB had taken up the case when allegations cropped up that global tenders were not floated for the purchase of the equipment in 2003. As per rules, global tenders have to be floated when purchases were made above ₹10 lakh. However, to circumvent that, seven tenders were floated on different occasions to purchase equipment for ₹68 lakh.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/vigilance-court-orders-reprobe-against-sooraj/article30577584.ece

257,2020/01/16,Accused in SSI killing remanded in judicial custody,"The prime suspects in the case pertaining to the gunning down of Special Sub-Inspector of Police Wilson at a check-post near Kaliyakkavilai on January 8, who were subsequently nabbed at Uduppi in Karnataka on Tuesday, were remanded in judicial custody till Monday (January 20).

As Abdul Shameem of Thiruvithancode and Thoufiq of Ilankadai in Nagercoil were produced before him on Thursday night, Kuzhithurai Judicial Magistrate II Jayashankar remanded them in judicial custody till Monday. The police had submitted a petition seeking the custody of the accused. Subsequently, the duo were taken to Palayamkottai Central Prison.

After Abdul Shameem and Thoufiq were nabbed at Uduppi, Deputy Superintendent of Police (Crime) and Investigation Officer of this case Ganesan and 20 armed policemen rushed to Uduppi and brought them to Nagercoil around 4.45 a.m. on Thursday.

They were taken to Kaliyakkavilai police station around 5.30 a.m. for an hour-long inquiry and then to Thuckalay police station for interrogation before being produced before the Judicial Magistrate. Since it was anticipated that both the accused would be produced before the Kuzhithurai Judicial Magistrate to complete the legal formalities, a large number of reporters and lensmen gathered in front of the police station even as Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tirunelveli Range, Praveen Kumar Abinapu and Dr. Shreenath were interrogating the duo.

“The successful operation was a result of combined efforts of Q Branch of Tamil Nadu police, Uduppi District Police and Kanniyakumari Police,” said Dr. Shreenath.

During interrogation, the duo reportedly told the police that they, who were agitated over the sustained targeting of Islamic radicals and their arrests by Tamil Nadu police and the arrest of Khader Moideen in New Delhi recently along with Ali Nawaz from Kanniyakumari district, gunned down Wilson as a random target.

Shameem and Thoufiq, who came from Neyyatinkara in Kerala in an autorickshaw to orchestrate the crime, returned to Injivilai near Parasala on foot after gunning down Wilson. Then they took a vehicle to reach Thiruvananthapuram from where they left for Uduppi following instruction from their handlers.

Anticipating a huge crowd, Tamil Nadu Police’s commando force was deployed at Thuckalay police station and also near the court.

Shameem and Thoufiq were brought out of Thuckalay police station amidst tight security at 8.45 p.m. and taken to the court.

“Since the Tamil Nadu police arrested their associates with arms and ammunitions that thwarted their plots, the duo shot dead Wilson in an attempt to terrorise the policece,” Mr. Shreenath told the waiting reporters.

258,2020/01/16,All set for ‘manjuvirattu’ at Siravayal,"The village Siravayal will host one of the biggest manjuvirattu and jallikattu events in the district on Friday and preparations are on, say revenue officials who inspected the site on Thursday.

Dubbed as one of the most ferocious bull taming events during Pongal, Siravayal is also well known for bull tamers getting injured and even killed in the sport.

“This year, we expect that over 300 bulls will take part in the event. Last year, 185 bulls took part. There will be about 170 tamers and all of them will undergo a medical fitness test before being let into the gallery,” said C. Sankara Narayanan, Revenue Divisional Officer, Devakottai.

“To ensure safety of bulls and tamers, we have spread coconut coir for about 200 metres from the ‘vadivasal.’ The collection point for bulls has been cordoned off from the main arena so that bulls do not return. A dry tank bed has been converted into a collection point to make it easy for bull tamers to collect their bulls without any hassle,” he added.

The event will take place in a 25-acre ground where bulls would be let loose. Siravayal bull taming sport is considered dangerous as it is another format of jallikattu, known as manjuvirattu. It has been reported in the past that bulls run amok into spectators goring people to death.

About 700 police personnel have been deployed for security duty to maintain order and avoid any mishap. Apart from barricades, fencing has been put in place to separate the arena from the spectators’ gallery.

“We have arranged four water tanker trucks apart from a permanent water tank for visitors. It is expected that 25,000 people will turn up to watch the event for whom proper toilet facilities have been provided. Two ambulances will be stationed and there will be two teams of medical experts to treat the injured. Vehicles and personnel of Fire and Rescue Services Department will be stationed,” said M. Jayalakshmi, Tahsildar of Tirupattur.

Two makeshift galleries have been erected to accommodate spectators apart from a separate gallery for media and VIPs.

Collector M. Pallavi Baldev was present.

John Pennycuick is hailed in the villages of Cumbum Valley for constructing the Mullaperiyar dam, which has been the source of water for irrigation. “The memorial measuring 2500 sq.feet was constructed by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa at a cost of ₹ 1 crore as a mark of respect to the Englishman who spent his entire fortune to construct the dam. Because of his efforts, farmers in the five districts of Theni, Dindigul, Madurai, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram get water today,” said Mr. Paneerselvam.

Superintendent of Police E. Saisaran Thejaswi, District Revenue Officer K. Ramesh, Uthamapalayam Revenue Divisional Officer Muthiah, PWD Executive Engineer Subramanian, Assiatnt Engineer Suresh and representatives of farmers’ organisations participated in the event.

Farmers of Sirumalai use ponies to transport horticulture produce up and down the hills everyday as many hamlets do not have road facilities.

261,2020/01/16,Melur daily market in dire need of revamp,"The 30-year-old daily market in Melur is an important place of trade for farmers of the area, who bring their agricultural produce in the hope of getting fair prices for them. However, the daily market that houses close to 106 shops cries for attention. With the structure remaining dilapidated, vendors are forced to use the pavement and common path to carry out their business.

A woman vendor, who has a temporary structure put up outside her stall on the pavement, says, “For the past 18 years, I have been selling agricultural produce in this market. With the main structure in a bad shape, I have no choice but to put the stall on the pavement. I have put up tarpaulin sheets to protect both the agricultural produce and me from the sunlight,” she says.

“We also have to battle cattle menace here. With no proper compound, the cattle come into the market and we have to shoo them away”, said S. Ilangovan, another vendor.

Also, there was no proper drainage facility at the market, he said. “The problem aggravates during the monsoon. The whole area becomes slushy and it is difficult for the sellers and the buyers to visit the market,” he says. Drinking water facility and maintenance of the toilet facilities had to be ensured, he said, adding that even allotment of shops at the market was not proper.

Provision of proper loading and unloading facility at the market was among the other other major issues pointed out by the vendors. They say that the place was very narrow and could not be used to the maximum. They also demanded a proper storage facility at the market.

Advocate B. Stalin who filed a public interest litigation petition before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court said that the important market had been in a bad shape for quite a while. Though several complaints had been submitted to the authorities concerned, they were not inspecting the market regularly.

In a counter affidavit filed before the High Court Bench by the Commissioner of Melur Municipality, it was submitted that due to the bad condition of the market, the vendors were asked not to use the building. They were permitted to use the open space outside the market premises.

The counter affidavit said construction of a modern structure of new shops had been proposed. An earlier proposal sent to State Planning Commission in 2016 at an estimate of ₹3 crore was returned on the ground that the project had to be executed by getting loan from the government under various schemes available.

Now another proposal, worth ₹5.50 crore, had been sent to the State government, the counter affidavit said.

Agreeing that the structure was dilapidated, Melur Municipal Engineer and Commissioner (in-charge) M. Rathinavel said that a proposal on an outlay of ₹5.50 crore had been sent to the State government for the revamp of the daily market.

“The existing structure will be completely demolished to make way for a new structure. It will have new facilities, including loading and unloading facility, storage containers, adequate parking area, compound wall, drinking water and toilet facilities,” Mr. Rathinavel said.

He said that the vendors would be accommodated at other vacant places near the existing market till the development works were completed.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dumql0/article30578038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA17-MDUMELURVEGETABLEMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/melur-daily-market-in-dire-need-of-revamp/article30578040.ece

The police arrested Jayaraj, 58, a labourer from Veduvar Colony, his sons Raja, 28, and Antony, 35 for allegedly murdering Thangamuthu and his daughter Sumathi.

They said Jayaraj and Thangamuthu had dispute over the ownership of a two-feet-wide strip of land between their houses and the long-drawn legal battle went in favour of Thangamuthu recently. When Sumathi, a mother of four children, who had come to his father’s house for Pongal celebrations, started whitewashing the wall of the house by going through the two-feet-wide land under dispute, it triggered altercation between her and Jayaraj’s family. When she was attacked with an iron rod, Thangamuthu rushed to save his daughter but he also came under the attack.

Sustaining gruesome head injuries, both Thangamuthu and Sumathi died on the spot.

On getting information about the double murder, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order), Tirunelveli City, S. Saravanan and the police rushed to the spot and sent the bodies to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for post mortem.

The Nambi Temple at Thirukkurunkudi, ‘Thalaiyanai’ near Kalakkadu and Vadakku Pachchaiyar Dam attracted huge crowd while hundreds of visitors camped at Gadana, Ramanadhi, Karuppanadhi, Gundar and Adavinaniar Dams.

The police made elaborate security arrangements in all places where the public camped to leisurely spend the day with their families, friends and relatives. All water bodies along the Tamirabharani watercourse and rain-fed tanks have good storage thanks to the active monsoon and the police kept watch on people who had come to these places.

The regulator has levied a fine of ₹6 lakh on 25FPS Media Private Limited and ₹3 lakh on Zee Media Corporation Ltd (ZMCL), SEBI said in an order.

The order comes after SEBI received a reference from Zee Media Corporation, wherein it informed the regulator regarding non-compliance of PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations by 25FPS during the period ranging from April 8 to April 23, 2019.

Following this, the regulator conducted examination in the scrip of ZMCL from April 8, 2019 to April 26, 2019 to ascertain whether there was any disclosure violation of PIT norms and SAST (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations by 25FPS and/or ZMCL.

During the examination, the regulator observed that IFCI Ltd had invoked pledge in respect of certain equity shares of the company pledged by 25FPS. The shareholding of 25FPS in ZMCL was continuously decreasing by virtue of invocation of pledge by IFCI during the period.

It further said that 25FPS was required to disclose details of such change in its shareholding within stipulated timeframe. Besides, ZMCL was required to notify the exchanges regarding the particulars of trades within two trading days of it “becoming aware of the same“.

“By not making the relevant disclosures on time, both the noticees have conveniently kept the general investors in dark regarding the change in the shareholding of one of the promoters,” SEBI said.

A person who answered the phone at the office of the third lawyer, Hiroshi Kawatsu, said she did not know if he still represented the former automotive executive.

Mr. Ghosn, who fled from Tokyo last month, told Reuters in an interview in Beirut with his wife Carole on Wednesday that he was happy to stay in Lebanon for the rest of his life and claimed he was treated with brutality during his detention and bail in Japan. Ms. Carole said she was ‘done with Japan.’

However, trade sources and analysts said China would struggle to meet the target and gains in oil are likely to be limited ahead of more detail on how the commitments will be achieved.

274,2020/01/16,"In a first, BBMP forms Biodiversity Management Committee","The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has formed a Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) as per the Bio Diversity Act of 2002, which mandates the establishment of BMCs at the local body level across the country.

The committee will work towards conservation and promotion of biological diversity. The primary responsibility of the committee includes documentation of biological diversity, preservation of natural habitats, conservation of landrace, local and regional breeds of animals and plants.

One of the important functions of the committee would be to prepare or help prepare People’s Biodiversity Register (PBR), which will contain comprehensive information on local flora and fauna, traditional and scientific knowledge, and information associated with species.

H.S. Ranganathaswamy, Deputy Conservator of Forest (DCF), BBMP, said that formation of BMC was long overdue. “As far as city corporations are concerned, the BBMP is now the first corporation in the State to have formed the committee,” he said.

The seven member committee has five nominated members with the Mayor being the ex-officio chairman and the BBMP commissioner the member-secretary.

“The committee will work under the Karnataka Biodiversity Board and National Biodiversity Authority. The committee will consult and also be consulted by the State boards or the National Biodiversity Authority on issues relating to resources and information on biodiversity under its jurisdiction,” he said, and added that the PBRs would provide significant inputs to the overall biodiversity information across the country.

Vijay Nishanth, urban conservationist, who has been nominated to the committee, said that the BMC would extend the scope of conservation and promotion of biodiversity in cities such as Bengaluru, which is witnessing rapid, unplanned urbanisation.

“Most of them are not even aware of how rich the city is in terms of biodiversity. Bengaluru is home to a wide variety of species – both animal and plant. Such committees will play an important role in bringing it to the notice of people and conduct more research on them,” he said.

The members of the committee are Akshay Heblikar, director, Eco-Watch; Vijay Nishanth, founder, Project Vruksha Foundation; Nandini N., professor, Department of Environmental Sciences, Bangalore University; Usha Anandi, professor, Department of Zoology, Bangalore University; and Bhargav V.R.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/in-a-first-bbmp-forms-biodiversity-management-committee/article30578946.ece

The students, in a statement issued on Wednesday, said that a group of people led by the MLA had stormed their campus, picked up students’ vehicles from outside the gate, and threatened to take them to the police station. The students also accused the group of moral policing.

“The censoring and saffronisation of street art happened all across the city on this day,” students have added in their statement.

BJP workers allegedly covered graffiti with saffron paint on Tuesday on grounds that they were offensive.

276,2020/01/16,Don’t allow development activities within 10-km radius of BNP till ESZ is finalised: HC,"The Karnataka High Court on Thursday directed the State and Central governments to ensure that no further commercial or developmental activities are undertaken within a 10 kilometre radius of Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) till finalisation of the draft notification to declare an eco sensitive zone (ESZ) around the park.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hamant Chandangoudar passed the interim order on a PIL petition filed by Banneghatta Nature Conservation Trust, Bengaluru.

However, the bench made it clear that the interim order is prospective, and it would not affect the commercial and developmental activities that were already undertaken within a 10-kilometre radius of BNP.

It has been pointed out in the petition that a draft notification was issued to declare an area of 268.96 sq. km., ranging from 100 metres to 4.5 km from the boundary of BNP, as ESZ by the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change on the advise of the State government.

However, this draft was allowed to lapse though no objection or suggestion was received, the petitioner said while pointing out that the State government in 2016 decided to reduce the area of the proposed ESZ, and accordingly the Centre on October 30, 2018 issued a fresh draft notification to declare 168.84 sq. km., ranging from 100 metres to 1 km around the boundary of BNP as ESZ.

The petitioner has also pointed out that the Ministry had on August 20, 2019 written a letter to the State government to declare 268.96 sq. km. as ESZ as proposed in the 2016 draft notification.

It has been contended that reducing the area proposed for ESZ would seriously affect the ecology as many ecologically sensitive areas were left out in the 2018 notification. The petitioner has also claimed that several commercial activities, like bottling plants for drinking water, residential layouts and governments housing schemes, were subsequently allowed in the area that was proposed as ESZ as per the 2016 draft notification.

The petitioner has sought a direction the State and the Centre to finalise the ESZ around BNP as per the 2016 draft notification, and prohibit commercial and other developmental activities within a 10-km radius of BNP till finalisation of ESZ.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/w88afy/article30577947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGBANNERGHATTABIOLOGICALPARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dont-allow-development-activities-within-10-km-radius-of-bnp-till-esz-is-finalised-hc/article30577948.ece
277,2020/01/16,CAA and NRC: Workers complain that Congress not doing enough to counter BJP’s outreach,"Even as top Congress leaders came down heavily on the BJP for notifying the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), party workers on Thursday expressed concern over the party not doing enough to counter the BJP’s campaign on the controversial CAA and NRC.

At a seminar organised by Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) on CAA and NRC, party workers, including District Congress Committee (DCC) presidents and elected representatives, said while the BJP had launched an aggressive door-to-door campaign to explain CAA and NRC, the Congress was ‘going soft’ on the issue.

“People are getting convinced by BJP and RSS workers’ door-to-door campaign. We should be able to communicate to the public in simple language what the problems are,” said a senior party worker.

Seconding him, Kavitha Reddy, Congress worker from Bommanahalli, said the party should prepare a list of simple Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about CAA and NRC.

Jayanagar MLA Sowmya Reddy said the BJP was coming up with innovative ideas to reach out to people. “We should print pamphlets and handbills in simple language on the two controversial Acts, and distribute them in our constituencies,” she said.

Earlier, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah said the Congress must take the leadership role in opposing CAA and NRC. “It is of no use if we oppose it clandestinely. It is of no use if we go and support some organisation that is protesting. We should take the lead in opposing this vehemently,” he said.

The party has adopted a resolution urging the Centre to revoke the Act.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/caa-and-nrc-workers-complain-that-congress-not-doing-enough-to-counter-bjps-outreach/article30577928.ece

S. Rajanna, branch manager, received an alert on his mobile phone that someone was trying to break into the firm around midnight. Rajanna alerted the area manager Nagesh D. before calling the police control room.

The night beat police of Chandra Layout rushed to the spot and caught Karthik, a 21-year-old from Mandya, red-handed and recovered a crowbar, which he was using to break open the shutter.

Rajanna, on reaching the spot, examined CCTV camera footage and the burglar alarm.

The police booked Karthik for attempt to house break and trespass, and remanded him in judicial custody.

In December, a gang had burgled a branch of Muthoot Finance Limited in Lingarajpuram and made away with 70 kg of gold valuables worth ₹16 crore. The accused had drilled a hole through a washroom adjacent to the office, and cut open the iron door of the strong room using gas cutters. The incident came to light when the staff came to the office the next morning, which was a Monday.

On instructions from Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan, bandobust arrangements will directly be supervised by joint commissioners of police.

“Of the 10,000 police personnel, 5,000 will be deployed at Marina beach, Kamarajar Salai and surrounding areas, while the remaining officers will be on duty at amusement parks or places where people are expected to gather in large numbers,” said Mr. Viswanathan in a press release.

Temporary police control rooms have been set up near the Labour statue and the Gandhi statue. As many as 11 police help centres have been set up on Loop Road, from the Labour statue to the Lighthouse.

Seven ambulances with medical facilities and two vehicles from the Fire and Rescue Services Department will be stationed here. Besides, motorboats and around 140 swimmers will be deployed at the beach for rescue services.

Thirteen temporary watch towers have been erected on the beach. At least three personnel will constantly monitor movement using binoculars and share information through walkie-talkies and WhatsApp with the main control room, besides cautioning people through public address systems.

Three drone cameras and 12 CCTV devices with high-resolution cameras will livestream the movement of people to control rooms from the beach area. Since bathing in the sea is prohibited, approach area to the water has been barricaded and police personnel will constantly monitor the area.

Joint Commissioner of Police, East, R. Sudhakar, said: “We will use drones and closed circuit television cameras to monitor the crowd, besides deploying our personnel at vantage points. A mounted horse unit and all-terrain vehicles will also be deployed to ensure that there are no offences.” Similar arrangements have been made at the Elliot’s beach and other beaches as well.

To tackle the problem of children getting lost in the crowd, police personnel in temporary help centres will make children wear bands on their arms, with details and mobile numbers of their parents.

Police personnel will also be deployed at places where people are expected to gather, such as the Guindy Children’s Park, Island Grounds, amusement parks and shopping malls.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yd36cq/article30574443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16KaanumPongal-Beach,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/police-makes-arrangements-for-kaanum-pongal-in-chennai/article30574444.ece
281,2020/01/16,Affiliated colleges want University of Madras to fix norms for evaluators,"Huge changes in marks post revaluation in the University of Madras has students doubting the capability of the evaluation process itself.

In the April 2019 semester, some students who had performed well were shocked to find their marks were drastically low. They applied for revaluation and found there were huge variations between their original marks and revaluation scores. The results of the November 2019 exams will be released shortly. College principals too are aware of the issue.

“Of the 20 PG students who apply for revaluation, at least 16, 17 will pass,” said the principal of a west Chennai college. The principal of a college in Poonamallee said at least half the students manage to qualify after revaluation.

Some professors raised it at the academic council meeting last February and a principal suggested penalising the erring evaluators. A rule of the university is that only consolidated marks must appear on each page. This is done to rule out bias during revaluation. But teachers say there is no saying if the evalulator reads the answers before marking them.

‘UG students mostly affected’

“Our students belong to the lower economic group. It is mostly UG students who are affected. We called for reimbursing the students who pass during revaluation,” the principal said.

The principals want the varsity to frame norms for evaluators. But they do agree that lack of sufficient teachers for some subjects is the bottleneck.

“The evaluators must be morally conscious. It is not about the number of years a professor has taught a subject but about how responsible they are about the evaluation process,” a senior professor said.

At present, anyone with two years’ teaching experience is called for valuation. But for revaluation, only those with over 25 years’ experience are invited.

Vice-Chancellor P. Duraisamy said, “We do not get sufficient number of examiners and hence are forced to invite teachers with at least two years’ experience. Every semester, about 10 lakh answer scripts are evaluated. The students are provided the photocopy of answer scripts. Students could apply for revaluation after getting a copy of the answer script too. We have also examined the cases where the difference is more than 15-20 marks,” he said.

Where the difference in revaluation is more than 20 marks the examiner would be debarred if any negligence is noticed, he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9u35h4/article30573875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/affiliated-colleges-want-university-of-madras-to-fix-norms-for-evaluators/article30573877.ece
282,2020/01/16,'Entha Manchivaaduvara' movie review: Kalyan Ram-starrer has an overdose of sweetness,"Director Satish Vegesna’s Sathamanam Bhavati was all about making time for your parents and showing them that you care. It stuck a chord with the audience.

In Entha Manchivaaduvara, the director suggests that one needn’t rely only on their relatives to step in and strengthen the bonds, even strangers can do it if they have the right intention. As the title suggests, the protagonist is an epitome of goodness and believes in spreading happiness.

Balu (Kalyan Ram) sets up the ‘All is Well: Emotion Suppliers’ company. Think of this company as a rental service for a son/daughter/brother/sister… If an elderly parent feels lonesome since their son or daughter lives abroad, one of this company’s members will step in, give the same affection and try to fill the void.

Who will buy such an idea, right? The director spells out his arguments through his characters. ‘About 15 years ago would you have believed that people will buy water? Now many of us do,’ Balu argues when his childhood friend and lady love Nandini (Mehreen) is sceptical.

Entha Manchivaaduvara Cast: Kalyan Ram, Mehreen Kaur Pirzada

Direction: Satish Vegesna

A little about Balu. As a child, he asks his parents to invite all their relatives for his birthday because that’s what matters to him most — sharing happiness with everyone. And he believes that what goes around comes around.

However when Balu loses his parents in an accident, his relatives don’t stand by him. But he doesn’t lose his innate goodness and grows up trying to play multiple roles — grandson or brother as the case may be, to complete strangers.

This role play becomes a full-fledged activity once the company is formally set up. Entha Manchivaaduvara is a remake of the Gujarati film Oxygen. This story unfolds in the lush green regions of Andhra Pradesh that are beautifully captured by the cinematographer Raj Thota, and Gopi Sundar gives a couple of hummable numbers.

But there’s little else going for the film. Watching Kalyan Ram and Mehreen being extremely compassionate and kind to everyone episode after episode, fulfilling roles, becomes excruciatingly boring. The two actors are earnest, and it’s not their fault that the extra sweetness of the story becomes too mundane. Imagine ordering a slice of cake to satiate your sweet tooth and it arrives doused in chocolate and caramel sauce, cream, chocolate shavings and so many other toppings that you struggle beyond a bite or two. This film feels like that.

Things get a little real when the focus shifts to Tanikella Bharani, who doesn’t know about the company. His eventual anger that his emotions have been played with, is understandable.

When the company members harp that they are ready to fulfil any relationship voids, they are dimwit enough to not see the obvious loopholes — what if someone approaches them for a partner with malicious intentions? What if a real grandson or son misunderstand their intentions as an attempt to usurp wealth? These gaffes gets answered through mandatory action sequences.

Somewhere down the line, Satish Vegesna might have felt that the story has way too much goodness and has tried to temper that with a villain — Gangaraju (Rajiv Kanakala).

Suhasini and Sharath Babu do justice to their extended cameos. Vennela Kishore as the sharp-tongued groom can’t do much to save this drab story. The only one with an occasional spark is Naresh who blurts out whatever he thinks.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/t5hdzl/article30575398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kalyan-ram-entha-manchivaduvaraa,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/entha-manchivaaduvara-review-this-kalyan-ram-starrer-by-director-satish-vegesna-has-an-overdose-of-sweetness/article30575399.ece
283,2020/01/16,Masterly rendition,"A 75-minute vocal concert by TV Gopalakrishnan (TVG) in Thrissur was an exposition of his musical erudition and deep insight into Tyagaraja compositions. The octogenarian virtuoso’s concert, being held here after a long break, attracted a number of listeners.

Rare ragas and compositions generally do not find favour with the audience. But TVG’s selections seemed an attempt to highlight the varied facets of the saint composer, especially since his was the opening concert of a three-day Tyagaraja aaradhana. In this respect, it was a didactic session for the listeners too.

Ode to Ganesha

Bangala raga, with which he began the concert, manifested in the not-so-frequently heard composition ‘Giriraja sudha tanaya sadaya’. The selection was appropriate as it was a short invocation to Ganesha. A janya of Sankarabharanam, it created an ambience of supplication. Gowlipanthu followed and the composition was ‘Thera theeyaga raadha’. The mood of the kriti, in which Tyagaraja entreated Lord Venkateswara to remove screens of anger, arrogance and jealousy that prevented him from attaining moksha was well-conveyed by the rendition.

Perhaps, the rarest among the ragas he rendered during the recital was Pratapavarali, janya of Harikamboji. ‘Vina nashakoni unnamura’ is the only composition in this raga. It was a treat to listen to the rendition as it was embellished with swaras aplenty.

The musician’s esoteric style of alapana came forth in the essaying of Kalyanavasantham. His movement through the sthayis was smooth. True to the expectations of the audience, he chose ‘Nadaloludai brahmanandamandave manasa’ in Roopakam. Gambhiravani was elaborated with all the concomitant melodic niceties and the composition was ‘Sadamadin dalatu gadara’, which described the virtues of Siva. Another rare raga, it is the janya of Naganandini, the 30th melakartha raga.

TVG chose the simple, pentatonic raga Mohanam as the main one for the concert. Innumerable were the shades of the raga that were painted on a wide canvas. Perhaps his voice blossomed in full in this exercise and at times he appeared lost in the raga while traversing the three octaves with abandon. ‘Mohana Rama mukhajitha soma’ embraced umpteen sangatis. Attukal Subramaniam was on the violin and during the tani, TVG encouraged him to give his best. The percussion tani by KMS Mani on the mridangam and Tripunithura Radhakrishnan on the ghatam was short but captivating.

Devoted to Rama

The post-main numbers were all on Rama but the sahithya was notable as it showcased the composer’s intense devotion to Rama. ‘Paripalaya, paripalaya, paripalaya Raghunatha’ in Reethigowla has many charanams, but all single line. The musician chose only a couple of them. The concluding one ‘Rama, Rama, Rama mam pahi’ was in Yamunakalyani, Adi.

The programme was organised by Kerala Brahmana Sabha.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/u4kk1x/article30567122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tvfTVG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/tv-gopalakrishnans-recital-in-thrissur-enthralled-listeners/article30567123.ece
284,2020/01/16,Strings of melody,"Haridas Alankode, a disciple of santoor maestro Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, displayed his musical prowess at a recital in Palakkad. A former student of Hindustani violinist AP Bhargavan, Hariadas’ training on the violin has helped him master the art of handling the santoor.

In santoor concerts, one raga is taken up for elaborate delineation. Accordingly, Haridas chose raga Bhimplas and portrayed it beautifully in the traditional style through two sections.

In the first section, ‘Anibadh Sangeet’, he developed the raga gradually from base octave notes to top octave notes. He played the raga with gliding techniques in the alaap, for the first segment.

Rhythmic notes

In the second segment, Jod, akin to thanam in Carnatic parlance, was presented rhythmically in a variety of permutations and combinations. Fast-paced musical phrasings marked the third segment Jhala, wherein he traversed through the entire instrument. The ragaswarupa emanated wonderfully in all the three segments. The prayoga ‘Nisagamapa’, often played in these segments, unfolded the charm of the raga.

‘Nibadh Sangeet’, the second section, comprised three compositions (Gath) and tabla artiste Retnasree Iyer joined him on stage.

In Vilambit laya, which was played intially, he played a slow-paced composition in Jap taal, equivalent to Khanda chapu in Carnatic music. In the Madhya laya, Haridas took up a piece in teen taal akin to Adi. In the third, Drut laya, he presented a fast-paced gath, again in teen taal. Handling the santoor deftly, he proved his command over it.

In the concluding session, he played a few folk tunes, initially in Madhyamavathi and then switched over to other ragas such as Sivaranjani, Durga, Bhageswari and finally coming back to Bhimplas, all in light classical style, which won the admiration of the audience.

Retnasree provided excellent support. Her dexterous beats and soft touches were a treat to watch and listen to. The rapport between Retnasree and Haridas was visible throughout the concert.

The programme was held under the auspice of Palghat Fine Arts Society.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/u87chv/article30567076.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tvfHaridas,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/review-of-santoor-recital-by-haridas-alankode-in-palakkad/article30567077.ece
285,2020/01/16,Plight of a king in exile,"Kirmeeravadham Kathakali is famous for its grammatical perfection and structured screenplay. While the story is based on various parts of Vanaparva from the Mahabharata, Kottarakkara Thampuran, the author of the attakatha, has taken the liberty of adding and excluding various scenes and characters. He has also played around with the timeline of the events on certain occasions. All these changes were made to ensure that the attakatha fits well with the grammatical structure of the artform.

Kirmeeravadham is divided into two parts with the first part usually called Pathracharitam as it depicts Dharmaputra receiving the Akshayapathra from the sun god, Surya. Kathakali enthusiasts in Ambalapuzha recently got an opportunity to watch a staging of Pathracharitam.

The first scene began with Dharmaputra entering the forest with his wife Panchali and poignantly portraying their fate through the enactment of a pathinja padam ‘Bale kel nee...’. The entry of the royal couple and the padam were choreographed to reflect the mental agony of the Pandavas, especially the eldest. Soka sthayi (sad mood) was maintained throughout the scene. The music and the percussion enhanced the scene.

Withstanding hardship

Dharmaputhra acknowledges the pain and suffering Panchali has to undergo in the forest and recalls the good old days with regret. While acknowledging the difficulties they are going through, Panchali emphasises that she is more concerned about her inability to feed the thousands of Brahmins who have accompanied the Pandavas to the forest. The first scene ends with the king deciding to consult his guru Dhoumya for a solution to the problem.

A scene from ‘Kirmeeravadham’ Kathakali | Photo Credit: Manoj Krishna M

The role of Dharmaputhra, the king in exile, is always a challenge to play for even experienced actors. Being a ‘dheerodaatha’ (chivalrous) hero, the mental agony of the king needs to be enacted with controlled expressions, but at the same time, the severity needs to be conveyed to the audience. On the choreographic side, the pathinja vattam vechu kalasam and the pathinja iratti (both slow tempo dance patterns) need to be performed with care, as it should not disturb the sthayi of the sathvikaabhinaya.

Kalamandalam Shanmughan who enacted the role of Dharmaputhra was able to complete this challenging part of the performance with perfection, doing justice to the Kalluvazhi school of acting, in which he has been trained in. Kalamandalam Vijayakumar as Panchali provided ample support with his subtle but effective expressions.

The second scene started with Dharmaputhra visiting his guru Dhoumya. The sage advises Dharamaputhra to worship Surya and assures the king that he would find a solution. Pleased with the king, Surya blesses him with the Akshayapathra. While the entire scene provided the audience value for their time, the enactment of the padam ‘Jaya Ruchira...’, needs special mention. With a perfect blend of thourathrika, the beautiful rendition stood out.

The thaonkaram, (a special dance sequence) at the end of each charanam was a feast to both the eyes and the ears.

Shanmughan provided a new dimension to the part where Dharmaputhra watches Surya disappearing, with a crisp but effective portrayal. Kalanilayam Karunakara Kurup and Yadukrishnan who played the roles of Dhoumya and Lord Surya respectively, lived up to expectations.

The final segment of the day’s performance saw Lord Krishna visiting the Pandavas. Dharamputhra complains to Krishna about their fate and gently criticises him for his inaction. Hearing this, an enraged Krishna summons his ferocious Sudarshana Chakra to demolish the Kauravas. Seeing the fury of the Sudarshana, Dharmaputhra pleads with Krishna to recall it and he agrees.

The enactment of ‘Pundareeka nayana...’, Dharmaputhra’s padam and the reply of Krishna, ‘Kashtamaho...’ was notable, especially the part where the King provokes the Lord with a mention of ‘Nanamillayo thava..’ (are you not ashamed). Kalamandalam Neeraj did justice to the role of Krishna, while Kalamandalam Arun Raju did well in the role of Sudarshanam.

Voice of experience

The music was led by veteran singer Pathiyoor Sankarankutty who enthralled the audience with his experience and skill, especially in the Kamboji padam ‘Bale kel nee...’. He was well-supported by Kalamandalam Krishnakumar and Sadanam Saikumar.

The rendition of ‘Jaya Ruchira...’ in raga Neelambari and ‘Pundarikanayana...’, again in Kamboji, was memorable.

Kalamandalam Venumohan on the chenda and Kalanilayam Manoj and Kalanilayam Rakesh on the maddalam provided perfect percussion support for the actors.

The performance was organised by Sandarsan Kathakali Vidyalayam, Ambalapuzha, as part of their Gurudakshina programme, where Guru Kalamandalam Vasu Pisharodi was honoured.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/q9jmo0/article30567043.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17tvfKirmeeravadham,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/review-of-kirmeeravadham-kathakali-performed-at-ambalapuzha/article30567045.ece
286,2020/01/16,"In Manesar, experience the life of an army officer","As civilians we don’t really know what goes into putting up a strong defence for the country. For a lot of us, army life is vaguely about immaculate uniforms, night-vision devices, and the perks of sports infrastructure.

To help people understand the training practices better, Maj Dinesh Sharma started Delta 105, an army-themed park, named jointly after his company (a group of soldiers and officers) and the pincode for Manesar, where the facility is located.

Where it all started

“The idea is to let people do something interesting and fun while learning something as well,” says Maj Sharma, who was commissioned into the 6th battalion of the Rajputana Rifles regiment and served for four years in the Uri sector during the Kargil war. He left the army in 2004 at the age of 29 and did an MBA in Human Resources at the Symbiosis Institute of Management Studies, Pune, working with corporations like Wipro and Mercer for about 12 years before starting this venture.

About a year ago, after identifying his calling of sharing the struggles and triumphs of military men and women with civilians, he took agricultural land on lease and revamped it. The idea was to design it in a way that would resemble an army camp, along with the expertise of a Delhi-based designer. The facility opened a couple of months ago.

All that’s green

The park is set in village Pada, a 30-minute drive from Gurugram, and is spread over a lush 26 acres, away from a densely populated area, much like most army areas are. “We wanted a big space so people don’t feel claustrophobic,” Maj Sharma says. He’s right. The fresh air reminds you of how rare a commodity it has become. On entry you are greeted by two commandos, both ex-army jawaans, sliding down from a rope, marking the onset of the action movie-like experience. He talks of a recent visit by a group of school children, who on seeing the commandos in action, immediately produced whatever paper they had on them, for autographs.

There are about 10 activities to keep you on the move, all led by an ex-army personnel. “We have a war zone which looks like an international border. Here we explain how the enemy enters, how to stop them, what weapons are used. There is a grenade range where they can learn to throw a dummy grenade, and a crawl trench where people learn that the lower you keep yourself, the lower your chances are of getting hit in an attack,” he says. There’s also a firing range, an obstacle course, a race course where people have to move with a ‘battle’ load, an assault course where big groups can learn teamwork, a paintball arena.

“We conduct sessions on how to fold a national flag, how to tie a knot. We have map related activities as well,” says Maj Sharma, talking about the various facilities available.

The food too takes a leaf out of each regiment’s speciality. This month, it’s the Jat regiment, so there’s makki ki roti and sarson ka saag. As with any army establishment, chai and nimboo pani flows freely.

What lies ahead

For Republic day, Delta 105 is organising a Military Fun and Food Carnival, where a few of Maj Sharma’s army friends will share their life stories. “We are trying to arrange food from the four regions of the country.” There’ll be an army band showcasing military tunes. “We’ll be inviting civil bands to compete with each other as they play patriotic songs.”

For those of us who spend most of our time sitting in office chairs, Maj Sharma tells us, “The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war.” While we will hopefully not have war, it helps to stay fit in peace.

287,2020/01/16,Raise a toast to health at Santé Spa Cuisine,"Healthy need not always mean boring — that was my epiphany at the end of a marvellous meal at Santé Spa Cuisine in Indiranagar. The vegetarian restaurant is in a charming house with indoor and outdoor seating options. The balcony with trailing greenery gives a European vibe and also can be a throwback to Bengaluru’s Garden City days. The interiors are all calming green and white echoing the back-to-nature ethos that the restaurant believes in.

The name, one of the partners, Pallavii Gupta, says comes from, “Santé, which means health in French and our food is driven by philosophies of spa cuisine.” And here I was thinking of a flea market! The French santé reminded me of a teacher in primary school correcting my pronunciation of votre santé in a story where the evil villain toasts the bound hero. I couldn’t care less about the pronunciation as I worried if the hero would get free and the villain his just desserts.

We started with a vitamin booster juice — you cannot really go wrong with a happy blend of carrot and orange with a dash of ginger adding a bite. The beetroot spinach hummus is rightly famous and the gluten-free khakras are a guilt-free accompaniment. There was also a black and white Moroccan hummus (both made of chickpea, with activated charcoal giving flavour and colour to the black one) which went well with vegan khakras.

The fresh fruits and nut bhel had the right mix of tart and crunch with micro greens, pomegranate arils, puffy fox nuts and hemp hearts. Before you get all excited, Pallavii says, “The hemp we use has under 0.3% THC, which makes it completely healthy and safe. The hemp hearts are also keto-friendly. We buy hemp from a legal company and we are currently the only restaurant serving hemp in Bangalore.”

The spinach mungo and hemp chowder was silky smooth. The North African harissa got a desi touch on low fat paneer in an interesting starter. Still on starters, what can one say about quinoa sushi rolls except that they were as dramatic as they looked and sounded? Wrapped in zucchini, they unspooled delightfully on the tongue.

Hits: Fresh fruits and nut bhel, crunchy chlorophyll dim sums

Meal for two: ₹1,800

I always felt sweet potatoes are pretenders. Like the bat in another story in my primary school English textbook who jumped sides in the war between animals and birds, saying it was both animal and bird (my older self recognises self-preservation), the sweet potato is neither sweet nor a proper potato. However, the sweet potato tikki chaat was an honest-to-goodness patty which could proudly walk to shoulder-to-shoulder with the accompanying chutney and vegetables.

Having tried the chaat, can pav bhaji be far behind? So in came the green pav bhaji — focaccia with spinach, raw banana, cauliflower and broccoli for bhaji. Since we had tried chaat and sushi, and didn’t want the dim sum to feel left out, we tried the crunchy chlorophyll dim sums in red curry. Vegan and gluten-free, they were translucent pillows of joy.

Feeling pleasantly full, we took little bites of the main course — gluten-free pizza verde with a ragi base and studded with fenugreek and the spicy Korean tofu bowl with a smidgen of jasmine rice. Then it was time for dessert and I was wishing I had another stomach.

The gulkand cheese slab (mascarpone cheese topped with muesli) and chocolate matcha truffle forest did the honours. For someone who is not particularly fond of chocolate, the green tea added an elegant line to the chocolate ball — all the better to play with.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ic2qqy/article30577077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bgmsante1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/raise-a-toast-to-health-at-sant-spa-cuisine/article30577078.ece
288,2020/01/16,Craig and Shaun McAnuff bring the ‘Original Flava’ in their cookbook,"Craig and Shaun McAnuff’s Original Flava: Caribbean Recipes from Home (Bloomsbury) is more than just a recipe book. Part travelogue, part family history and part food memoir with gorgeous photographs, the book serves up one thrill after another, including a raft of vegetarian recipes.

Original Flava, also a YouTube channel run by the brothers, was first self-published in 2017. That, say the brothers, “Will always be close to our hearts, and we’ll always be immensely proud of it, as we did it all by ourselves: from the recipes, the photoshoot ideas, to sending off the books from our Nan’s shed!” This edition, however, “is everything we wanted it to be”. The London-based brothers travelled to Jamaica to find out more about not just their family history, but also the food they had grown up with. With a location photographer in Jamaica and a food photographer for recipes, the result is stunning.

Food memories Craig: Best memories would be going to family parties and enjoying all the different types of food. Bad one... I had one too many variations at one party as a kid and started throwing up!

Shaun: Best memories would be at Christmas when all the family would be together and enjoying a selection of Caribbean favourites like jerk chicken turkey, lamb, ham, vegetable and rum cake. Bad is going to a friend’s house and the food not being seasoned.

Having grown up in south London, Craig and Shaun were always “surrounded by a multitude of cultures: British, Indian, Asian and African”. Food was a big part of this, and the smells and tastes inspired them to experiment with those and Caribbean food. But the biggest influence on their cooking is their Nan or grandmother. All their dishes have to be approved by her. Given that her generation cooks almost by instinct and the instructions were most probably a ‘handful of this’ and ‘a pinch of that,’ I wonder what it took to get precise measurements for the book. “It was pretty tough at first,” they admit, “because we weren’t really taught how to do measurements. We watched our nan/mum and asked her how much she was putting in and then estimated it to a teaspoon or tablespoon. It took a lot of practice to get it right.”

The recipes are divided into various sections: all day, side dishes, street food, drinks, desserts and more. One section, Ital is Vital, focusses on vegan dishes inspired by the Rastafarian lifestyle. This happened because Shaun went vegan for a year. “It made me feel great so I started experimenting with Caribbean fruits and vegetables,” he says “and found that you could get the same flavours that you would in a meat dish just by using the same seasonings.” What does he look for when exploring vegan or vegetarian recipes? “Texture and taste,” he says.

Many recipes have an Indian flavour. The coconut Ital stew reminds me of appam and ishtew and the yam and pumpkin curry and plantain chickpea curry bring back memories of mom’s kitchen. “Jamaican food is a pot of various influences from around the globe,” say Craig and Shaun. “We’ve adopted the saying ‘out of many, one people’.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ohwdlj/article30576948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Original-Flava-cover,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/craig-and-shaun-mcanuff-bring-the-original-flava-in-their-cookbook/article30576951.ece
289,2020/01/16,Octopus in my salad,"Saina Oji had never touched an octopus before. As she held one up gingerly, she wasn’t sure what to do with it. It felt slimy and she took a moment to reflect. “Roast it is”, she decided, and began prepping for her maiden octopus challenge. Her team joined in, chopping onions and tomatoes and peeling garlic.

At a recent seafood festival held on the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) campus in Kochi, the octopus was the chief attraction.

“My fish dishes are usually good. But the octopus was a daunting task,” says Saina, a member of the Society For Assistance to Fisherwomen (SAF), who took charge of the cooking for the three-day festival. SAF is an agency under the Department of Fisheries, Kerala, to help fisher-women set up micro-enterprise units. Saina, whose husband was a fisherman, has taken the lead in many such food festivals organised by the fisheries department.

Taking suggestions from the officials, Saina made some of her favourite dishes, substituting fish with octopus. The menu therefore had octopus puttu and octopus biryani, both of which were hits. “On the last day I had people queuing up for more; many wanted recipes, some wanted me to make octopus cutlets,” she says.

Organised by the Marine Biological Association of India (MBAI) on the sidelines of an international symposium on marine ecosystems, the festival was aimed at creating awareness on the culinary potential of the octopus, along with other Cephalopods such as squids, cuttlefish, clams and mussels. Unlike the other Cephalopods, octopus is not traditionally consumed in India. Rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, it is known to have health benefits such as reducing hypertension and hyperglycaemia.

The species commonly found on the Kerala coast are the web-foot octopus (Amphioctopus Fangsiao), the old woman octopus (Cistopus Indicus) and the common octopus (Octopus Vulgaris), all relatively small in size, says Dr K Sunil Mohammed, principal scientist at the CMFRI. “We only discovered the export potential of Cephalopods in the 1970s. Earlier, even squid was not so popular in India as it is today,” he says. India produces over 200,000 tonnes of Cephalopods every year, most of which is exported mainly to Spain, Portugal, Italy and Japan. Out of this, octopus constitutes an average of 10,000 tonnes, he says. Commonly used in Mediterranean, Greek, Japanese and Korean cuisine, the global unit price for octopus is around $ 6-7 per kilo. “We have no local demand for it yet, and hence it is not easily available in the local market,” says Sunil.

Caught in trawl-fishing, it is usually found off Kochi, Beypore and Kollam along the Kerala coast. “We get a good quantity from the East coast as well,” says Faraz Javeed, Director of Abad Fisheries, which exports 500-600 tonnes of octopus per year. “We have a very small, niche market for it here. But we still do get orders.” Octopus is available at Abad Fisheries outlets (at approximately ₹150 a kilo). “The octopus is very often available in the local markets of Goa, Mumbai and Mangaluru,” says consultant chef and food stylist Ramu Butler, who runs a multi-cuisine restaurant, B at Bay, in Kochi. However, most of the octopus what he uses for his salads are the frozen and canned.

Though regular diners may find it alien, the octopus has always made an appearance in special seafood showcases at fine dining hotels in Kochi.

While Saina cooked hers in a thick gravy of naadan fragrant masala, which had coriander, Kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric, garlic and green chillies, Executive Chef of Casino Hotel, Shaikh Asif Ali has tried octopus salads with success. “The meat is hard and turns rubbery if it is over-cooked. It should be only blanched,” he says. Asif usually prepares pasta and salads with baby octopus, though he says, the bigger ones have more flavour.

Saina’s Octopus Masala: Saute onions in ginger garlic paste and add slit green chillies and stir. Add Kashmiri chilli powder, pepper and turmeric powder, fish masala and a dash of coriander powder. To this mixture, add diced tomatoes and keep stirring, adding water little by little. To this, add cleaned octopus, salt and let it simmer, until the gravy thickens. For flavour, Saina recommends adding coriander and pudina leaves.

Ramu Butler prefers a salad, too. “A salad is the best bet. Octopus is suited for oriental cuisine; a stir-fry or even in main course such as a mixed fried rice. But a baby octopus salad is more sought-after. We use small octopuses, and it is not cut; but placed with the tentacles, doused in balsamic vinegar, on a bed of greens. It adds crunch to the salad. In India, many still consider it a cultivated taste.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/octopus-in-my-salad/article30576519.ece
290,2020/01/16,Pazhamkanji has made it to the menu at several hotels,"“In an earthen bowl, mix fermented rice with green chilli, shallots and onion. Top with layers of curd, mashed tapioca, pickled beetroot, and mango pickle. Add spicy fish curry, a side-dish of dried fish fry (karuvadu) and gulp it down...”: Overheard at Kantharees, Mangalapuram near Kazhakkoottam, from a diner gushing about his tryst with pazhamkanji.

The city has seen an exponential rise in eating-out options, both small-scale and upmarket. And despite a range of international cuisines, and modern Indian food, good, old pazhamkanji is what is making the most dramatic impact.

A hearty, local breakfast, pazhamkanji had almost disappeared from many homes when it made a splash on social media a year ago for its many health benefits. Fermented rice served in earthen bowls with curd, pickle and green chilli is its simplest version but flavours vary from house to house and region to region, depending on how the rice is fermented, ingredients added and accompaniments served.

Now there are hotels in the city where only pazhamkanji is served (like Kantharees), or where it is the top seller on the menu.

At Moopilan’s Kitchen near Killippalam junction, one of the first to serve nostalgia in bowls, cooked rice is left to ferment overnight with onions, coriander leaves, ginger, garlic and udamkolli mulaku (a variety of chilli). The next day, it is served with ginger, mashed tapioca, pickle, chilli and a piece of karuvadu.

“This is how my maternal grandmother used to prepare pazhamkanji while I was a kid,” says Syam Murali, who started the outlet with his mother-in-law, Vijayakumari. The same recipe is followed at his new restaurant, Neymeen Choora Oru Bheekarameenanu, near General Hospital, where fish ‘thala’ curry is served with the rice gruel.

At Edaneram, near Bakery Junction, rice is fermented in buttermilk (and not water), with ginger, green chillies, shallots and curry leaves.

“We tried several methods to get the best taste. To ensure that the rice does not get too fermented, the buttermilk should not be too sour. Also, we don’t sell pazhamkanji after 3.30 pm because by that time, the gruel will become over-fermented. We serve it with fish peera (thoran), chutney and pappadam,” says Loly Malvin, proprietor of Edaneram. At Rasavada, Kowdiar, besides the usual toppings, pulissery and rasam come with the pazhamkanji.

The entrepreneurs admit they were apprehensive about whether pazhamkanji would have enough takers when they launched.

“Many well-wishers dissuaded me from starting a restaurant to sell only pazhamkanji. But I enjoy it so much that I wanted others to get a taste of it. Now we have a steady clientèle, especially in and around Technopark area. We get advance orders as well,” says Bhuvan Syam who runs Kantharees.

Healthy meal Fermented rice is rich in vitamins and generates bacteria that help in digestion. It is supposed to keep the body light, cool, fresh and energetic. It is known by different names such as poita bhaat (Assam), pazhaya saadham (Tamil Nadu), Pakhala bhat (Odisha), panta bhaat (Bengal), tanajana (Tulu community) and chaddannam (Andhra Pradesh)

Social media has played a vital role in popularising pazhamkanji. “I wanted an offbeat eating-out experience and the humble pazhamkanji did the trick, thanks to several food groups on Facebook and videos posted by some of our customers. The other day we had a family from Kochi who stopped at our place to have pazhamkanji while returning from a trip to Kanyakumari. Apparently, they had seen a video about our hotel,” he says. A surprise factor for all of them is that majority of their customers are young. Loly says her venture aimed at popularising ethnic, traditional food. However, contrary to her expectations of being patronised by senior citizens, she has customers of all ages.

Manikantan V Nair, owner of Rasavada, concurs. And Somnath Ganeshan of Steampot says many customers order his pazhamkanji via food delivery apps. The dish is priced between ₹40 and ₹90 at the hotels.

Recipe Soak cooked rice (any variety) in water and leave it to ferment overnight, preferably in an earthen pot. Have it the next day by adding salt, curd, bird’s eye chilli, pickle and any curry of your choice (vegetarian or non-vegetarian). This is the basic recipe. The flavour changes if you add crushed ginger, green chilli and onions/shallots the previous night or in the morning. Dry fish fry or karuvadu and the previous day’s fish curry are much sought-after sides. Pulissery, rasam, mashed tapioca or jackfruit, pickled vegetables... all of it can be mixed with pazhamkanji.

“Rich in carbohydrates and considered a ‘cooling food’ for summer months, it was the staple diet in several economically backward families in many places in Kerala. Also called ‘Pazhinji’ in parts of Neyyattinkara, I would say it was the secret of the energy of youth once upon a time!” says NS Sumesh Krishnan, poet and faculty at Government Arts and Science College, Kulathoor.

Fans of pazhamkanji such as Biju Balakrishnan, a poet and research officer with Kerala Institute of Languages, regularly pack pazhamkanji for lunch. “It’s a big hit among my colleagues! Our eating habits have changed. However, it is good to see that we are bringing back traditional food and there are pazhamkanji shops in rural areas as well,” says Biju.

Still unconvinced?

291,2020/01/16,Padmanabham on Janpath: North India’s South India,"Enter Padmanabham, a South Indian restaurant next door to the ever-crowded Saravana Bhavan on Janpath, and you might feel a sense of deja vu. It looks so familiar because this new opening, whose menu is curated by food consultant Bakshish Dean, has replaced The Masala Trail by Osama Jalali.

The Masala Trail had opened in early 2017, fast becoming popular for how it brought street-food from all over India into a concentrated spot in central Delhi.

Now, Padmanabham offers continuity in its menu — call it a hat-tip to the success of its predecessor here, or an acknowledgement of the establishments that played a part in opening Delhi up to flavours that it mistakenly bundled up into one homogenised entity until not too long ago. In its last few pages, Padmanabham lists the stereotypical North Indian fare, as well as a condensed menu from The Masala Trail, just in case.

The vibe: Decor-wise, Padmanabham does the usual things that’s expected of it: incense sticks, flowers, a statue of a Hindu deity, the brass utensils, and serving staff in dhoti. One part of the restaurant is inspired by the Madurai Meenakshi temple’s corridors (the roof is painted in vaguely similar murals), and another part by the Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram. The walls jump with paintings of various scenes — we sat under what might’ve been a havan, though one can’t be too sure. Would the Janpath crowd be too rushed or hungry to care about these nuances? Perhaps. Would the staff even know about these paintings to explain? No. Each of these temples and their specific towns also has a rich food culture — for a restaurant to be be inspired by decor elements, but not by their food is possibly a wasted opportunity.

Do try: Their tiffins and the south-Indian-street-inspired 65s. This is a fully vegetarian restaurant, so the 65s are the legendary south Indian gobhi 65, called the Cauliflower 65 here, as well as Mushroom, Potato, and Paneer 65.

The Caulifower and Mushroom 65s had the crisp comfort of fried batter on the outside and the zing and freshness of gently marinated vegetable on the inside. The idlis were soft and had the texture of homemade well-soaked batter. The chutneys — a regular spread of tomato, coriander, and coconut — were notable. But they were repeated with all the snacky items.

Their Paruppu Vadai, especially the masala variant, are well-done, leaving no oil on your fingertips, but a full crunch into softness in your mouth. The pineapple halwa (desserts) was a treat, with fresh chunks of pineapple that you’d ideally have at the 3 p.m. tiffin time, washed down with a hot cup of filter coffee. Bliss.

Skip: The paniyaram were a bit doughy and we couldn’t really find the pieces or the taste of the vegetable in the carrot variety. The bhojanam (the full meal on a banana leaf) will be served starting 5th February, but some red flags here. Each day of the week is dedicated to bhojanam from a different state. The intention is to stay authentic, but the generic blurb for these includes “pullisery” a name specific to Kerala. Bet no one in Andhra would know what that means.

We were served the Karnataka bhojanam, a satisfying meal if you ignore the fact that instead of the typical short sona masoori rice, the bhojanams have a long grain basmati (in addition to red rice) — never underestimate the extent to which the texture and flavour of a south Indian dish is affected by the rice with which you eat it.

The Bisi Bele Bhaath wasn’t the rich, spiced dish that it usually is — this one felt like a dilution into drumstick/moringa daal, perhaps catered to a Delhi audience.

“Each section is helmed by a chef from that particular state,” the menu promises — though confusingly, the chef who spoke to us on behalf of the Karnataka bhojanam, was from Kerala.

Go with: Friends and family for tea-time peckishness

292,2020/01/16,Sanjay Raut withdraws his remark against Indira Gandhi,"Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Thursday withdrew his controversial comments wherein, he claimed that former prime minister Indira Gandhi met gangster Karim Lala in Mumbai.

“If someone feels my statement hurt Indira Gandhi’s image, or someone’s feelings, I take it back,” Mr. Raut said.

“In the past, I have taken her (Gandhi’s) side and argued with people who tried to malign her image. In such cases, some Congress leaders had remained silent,” the Rajya Sabha member said. During an interview to the Lokmat media group at its award function in Pune, Mr. Raut claimed, “When (underworld don) Haji Mastan came to Mantralaya, the entire secretariat would come down to see him. Indira Gandhi used to meet Karim Lala in Pydhonie (in south Mumbai).”

Congress leaders Milind Deora and Sanjay Nirupam on Thursday morning asked Mr. Raut to withdraw his ill-informed remarks.

However, before taking back his comments, Mr. Raut said that his words were ‘twisted’ by those unaware of Mumbai’s history as he meant that Ms. Gandhi met Karim Lala in his capacity as representative of the Pathan community.

Karim Lala was one of the three top underworld dons of Mumbai for over two decades, from the sixties to early eighties and the other two being Mastan Mirza alias Haji Mastan and Varadarajan Mudaliar.

“Kareem Lala was leader of Pathan community and he led an organisation called ‘Pakhtun-e-Hind.’ It was in this capacity of the leader of Pathan community that he met several top leaders including Indira Gandhi. However, those who do not (know) the history of Mumbai, are twisting my statement,” Mr. Raut said in a tweet.

“I have never shied away from praising Indira Gandhi as an iron lady who took decisions with iron fist. Surprisingly those who do not (know) history of Indiraji are shouting on top of the voice,” he said in another tweet.

Latching onto the controversy, former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis sought an explanation from the Congress leadership over Mr. Raut’s comments and wondered whether the Congress was funded by Mumbai’s underworld.

The BJP leader also questioned if it was the beginning of criminalisation of politics in the state, and if the Congress supported those who attacked Mumbai.

294,2020/01/16,"Spolit for choice between SUVs, sedans and hatchbacks","Choices galore

Dr Bharat S Rastogi, Ghaziabad: I want to replace my 2012 Renault Pulse diesel with an automatic hatchback, compact sedan or a compact SUV, within a budget of ₹7-14 lakh. My monthly drive is around 1,500-1,800 km. My shortlist includes the Duster diesel; the Volkswagen Ameo; the Honda Amaze diesel VX; and the Glanza V CVT. Should I wait for next year when more models and BS-VI engines are in market, as my top two choices, the Honda Amaze and Glanza, will still be there?

Both the Honda Amaze and Glanza will be available in BS-VI spec next year, so those options are there for you. We feel the face-lifted VW Vento with the new BS-VI 1.0 TSI engine will be a good option. This engine will be locally produced, so cost of service and spares will be lower too. Another option is the Duster with a new 1.3 turbo-petrol with a CVT.

Look at BS-IV vehicles

Rahul, Coimbatore: I need a powerful SUV within my budget of ₹15 lakh (on road). Should I wait till BS-VI norms come into effect or should I go with a BS-IV model, with hefty discounts?

We suggest you look at the current range of BS-IV vehicles because a lot of good diesel will be phased out when BS-VI norms are implemented. We recommend the Renault Duster diesel or the Nissan Kicks, which are powered by the punchy 1.5 Renault diesel engine that will not be upgraded to BS-VI. There are some good discounts available on these vehicles, but we understand that diesel engine supply has stopped, so you need to buy one before stocks run out.

Buy at the earliest

Shree Pangarkar, Pune: I am planning to buy a performance hatchback, preferably an automatic, and have short-listed the Volkswagen Polo GT, as it has a nice performance. However, some dealers in Pune are saying there’s no discount on the GT, even on the BS-IV variants, and that the engine is going to be the same in the BS-VI versions with some software updates. Therefore, they say, they aren’t offering any discounts. Hence, I don’t know whether to wait till March 2020 for any discounts or cancel my purchase or if the dealers are telling lies.

Firstly, your dealer is either lying or is not aware that the 1.2 TSI engine will be phased out in the transition to BS-VI. It will be replaced by a state-of-the-art 1.0 TSI that develops similar power, but as it’s a three-cylinder engine, it won’t be quite as smooth as the four-cylinder 1.2 TSI. Our advice is to go for the 1.2 TSI before it gets phased out, as it is a smooth and punchy engine that works brilliantly in conjunction with the 7-speed DSG gearbox.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/71kers/article30574662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGMHONDA-AMAZE,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/spolit-for-choice-between-suvs-sedans-and-hatchbacks/article30574663.ece
295,2020/01/16,Highlights from the Consumer Electronics Show 2020,"The Consumer Electronics Show held at Las Vegas is the largest tech, gadget and electronics event of the year; but it is not just about phones, TVs, drones etc. Carmakers and auto-component suppliers have also gone big at CES, using the event to showcase seemingly far-fetched auto tech. Read on to know more about some of the automotive highlights...

1. Mercedes Vision AVTR

The play on the word ‘avatar’ is there for a reason. The Vision AVTR — or Advanced Vehicle Transformation — was developed with input from the team behind the blockbuster Avatar movie franchise by James Cameron. The futuristic concept doesn’t preview a production model, and while the sleek flowing line from the front is attractive, the active flaps — the concept has 33 of them — on the rear panel could split opinion. Also unique to the concept are spherical tyres and the ability to crawl sideways at an angle of up to 30 degrees. The futuristic elements carry on to the cabin as well; everything is handled via a holographic display that spans the width of the cabin and there is a lack of any conventional control surfaces — steering included. Power comes from two electric motors; one on each axle.

2. Hyundai S-A1

Another year, another flying car — this time around, it’s by Hyundai. Co-developed with ride-hailing service Uber, the S-A1 previews another take at aerial mobility. The car has vertical take-off and landing capabilities and the ability to seat four passengers and a pilot — the latter would eventually be replaced by an AI. The electric flying car concept also has a claimed charge time of as little as 5-7 minutes. The S-A1 was part of a larger display by Hyundai, which included a Purpose Built Vehicle (PBV) — an autonomous shuttle-style vehicle that previewed the future of intra-city travel.

3. Fisker Ocean

Fisker showcased its all-electric SUV to the public for the first time at CES. The all-electric SUV has a claimed range of up to 482km, is powered by two axle-mounted motors and has a cabin made using recycled and eco-friendly materials to increase its green quotient. Highlights of the SUV include a mode that opens all the windows (including the rear quarter glass and windscreen) to give a pseudo open-top experience, and a full-length solar roof. The big news is that this model could be on its way to India with a launch sometime in late-2022 being under consideration.

4. Sony Vision-S

While gamers waited with bated breath for new info on the upcoming PlayStation 5, Sony surprised car nuts with the Vision-S concept car. The Vision-S previews the electronics giant’s offerings for in-car entertainment and connectivity technology. And with dual 272hp electric motors, the concept isn’t a slouch in terms of performance, either. However, one big question remains: does this mean that will Sony make its own car?

5. Chrysler Airflow Vision concept

FCA seemed to reach back into the history of one of its brands, with the name of the Chrysler Airflow Vision concept. Back in the 1930s, Chrysler made a streamlined (for its time) model called the Airflow. The Airflow Vision concept, though, is based on the Pacifica MPV and features a sleek design and a roomy four-seat cabin with a number of displays — the instrument cluster, an infotainment system, one for the front passenger, one for the air-con controls and the rear-seat entertainment displays.

6. Bosch Virtual Visor

Bosch brought an innovative new active visor utilising LCD, camera and AI technology. A see-through LCD panel with a honeycomb pattern sits in place of the traditional sun-visor. An occupant-facing camera and AI technology are used to identify the occupant’s eyes and the angle of sunlight. Based on the input, individual honeycombs turn opaque to prevent sunlight from falling directly onto the person’s eyes.

7. Sennheiser and Continental speaker-less audio system

It’s a rather intriguing concept. It uses specially developed actuators to vibrate trims and surfaces within a car’s cabin (in a similar fashion to a speaker’s diaphragm) to generate sound in different frequency ranges.

8. In-Car Wireless charging

A US-based start-up, Yank Technologies, revealed a wireless charging solution capable of charging multiple electronic devices within the car at the same time. The essence of the tech is simple: charging your phone or electronic device anywhere within the car without the need for a charging pad. The phone or device will have to support wireless charging for it to work. The company also says that its wireless system generates less radiation than a mobile phone placed on a person’s ear.

9. Nawa Racer concept

The retro-inspired e-bike concept from French company Nawa Technologies was a technology preview from the company. The highlight of the bike was its hybrid battery system, which paired the company’s ultracapacitors with conventional lithium-ion cells — a world-first. The system comprised a 0.1kWh ultracapacitor, which assisted a 9kWh battery and gave the bike an up to 300km range and tipped the scales at just 150kg. The concept was powered by a 100hp hubless-rim electric motor.

10. Aston Martin, Gentex Camera Monitoring System

The camera monitoring system basically uses three rear-facing cameras, one hidden within each wing mirror — the mirrors are not replaced by cameras — and one at the rear provides a live feed to a display integrated into the internal rear view mirror. The system uses Gentex’s Full Display Mirror — the rear-view mirror can function as a regular unit when the display is off — to meet regulations as well as allow drivers to set up the digital feed to their liking. Aston Martin will be using the system, it’s just not known which will be the first model to use it.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/62ucar/article30574519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bgmGentexAstonMartinFDMjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/ces-2020-highlights/article30574525.ece
296,2020/01/16,Puducherry CM Narayanasamy challenges Kiran Bedi on land grabbing issue,"Challenging Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi and rebel Congress legislator N. Danavelou to prove their charge that he and his son were involved in land grabbing, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Thursday said he would demit his office the moment they are able to establish the charges.

“I will resign the moment the allegations are proved correct. Ms. Bedi and Mr. Danavelou should accept the challenge and publicly state that they would resign from public life if they are not able to establish the charges,” he said, addressing a press conference along with Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam.

Flaying the Lt. Governor for issuing a statement after meeting Mr. Danavelou, that the Congress legislator has orally complained about land grabbing by the Chief Minister and his son, Mr. Narayanasamy said her decision to brief the media without getting a written complaint or proof showed her lack of administrative experience. She did not even wait for obtaining a written complaint or gathering evidence, he added.

Before going public, Ms. Bedi should have waited for a written complaint and forwarded it to the police or Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Chief Minister said. “Anybody can make any allegation. By making an oral submission public the Lt Governor has tarnished my image. It shows her vengeance against me. Ms. Bedi has been trying her best to collect some evidence against me for the last three and a half years,” he said.

Her conduct had brought disrepute to the constitutional position she occupied, the Chief Minister alleged, adding that he had formally complained about Ms. Bedi to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah during his recent visit to New Delhi.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/wi67jq/article30574785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NARAYANASAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-cm-narayanasamy-challenges-kiran-bedi-on-land-grabbing-issue/article30574767.ece
297,2020/01/16,Saminathan re-appointed as BJP president in Puducherry,"Nominated legislator V. Saminathan has been re-appointed as the president of Puducherry unit of Bharatiya Janata party.

Union Minister of State for Culture Prahlad Singh Patel made the announcement at the party office here on Thursday. Mr. Saminathan, who comes with RSS back ground, was appointed as the local unit president in 2015. Prior to his appointment as president, he served as the party general secretary for a long time.

He was appointed as nominated legislator along with party functionaries K.G. Shankar and S. Selvaganapathy in July 2017 by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Mr. Patel also announced the decision to nominate senior leader S.P.K. Damodaran to party’s national council.

298,2020/01/16,Puducherry Congress legislator N. Danavelou suspended,"The Puducherry Congress has cracked the whip on legislator N. Danavelou by suspending him for indulging in anti-party activities.

Disclosing the party high command’s decision to initiate disciplinary action against the legislator, chief of Pradesh Congress Committee A. Namassivayam on Thursday told media that the MLA had been served with a show cause notice seeking an explanation on the reason for not initiating further proceedings against him.

“The legislator has indulged in gross indiscipline by airing his views to the media before taking up the issues with party leadership. We will take further action based on his reply,” the PCC chief said.

Reiterating the charge that Mr. Danavelou was levelling allegations now after he failed to topple the government by conniving with the principal Opposition party All India N.R. Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party, Mr. Namassivayam said the legislator was merely functioning on the basis of advice given by AINRC and BJP.

Ramachandran seeking his support for a regime change in the Union Territory, the PCC chief said adding that the rebel legislator was not attending any of the party programmes for the last one year.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/o4aoaa/article30574644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16DANAVELOU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-congress-legislator-n-danavelou-suspended/article30574645.ece
299,2020/01/16,Foreign tourists enthralled by Pongal festivities,"A bullock cart-ride organised by Tamil Nadu Tourism Department at Veera Narasingampettai in Thiruvaiyaru taluk on Pongal captivated foreigners who took part in the festivities as special guests.

303,2020/01/16,ISL | Heartbreak for Hyderabad FC at home,"Marcelinho’s first-minute goal, the fastest of the season, was to of no avail as host Hyderabad FC frittered away a great start to lose 2-1 agaianst Odisha FC in an ISL match at the GMC Balayogi Stadium here on Wednesday.

For the sparse holiday crowd, there was something to cheer straight away as Marcelinho showed great opportunism to slot in a right-footer, from a very difficult angles, past Odisha custodian Dorronsoro.

But, Odisha fought back and Aridane Santana capitalised on a goalmouth melee to get the equaliser in the 15th minute.

Hyderabad FC had a chance to nudge ahead but Bobo, who had a forgetful evening, failed to convert the a spot kick in the 33rd minute after Nestro’s cross deflected off defender Sarangi’s arm.

Odisha took the match-winning lead in the 45th minute when Dimple Bhagat committed a serious foul on an advancing Santana and the Spaniard slotted in the resultant penalty. For Odisha, it was a fourth- straight win, while the home team are stuck at the bottom with just a win from 13 games.

The result: Hyderabad FC 1 (Marcelinho 1) lost to Odisha FC 2 (Aridane Santana 15, 45).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/32a5y4/article30579035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17SANTANA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/heartbreak-for-hyderabad-fc-at-home/article30579036.ece
304,2020/01/16,ISL | Commanding win for Chennaiyin FC,"Chennaiyin FC rode on two brilliant strikes from Rafael Crivellaro and Nerijus Valskis to script a commanding 2-0 win over NorthEast United FC (NEUFC) in an Indian Super League match here on Thursday.

Missing quite a few really good opportunities to score in the first session, it felt as if Chennaiyin would go on to rue those chances later given the way the league has panned out for the host.

The second session, however, effectively belied it.

Known for his vision, lone-range and rapier-like passes, Crivellaro, the 30-year-old midfielder, this time, produced a blinder.

Picking the ball from just a few metres away from the half-way line, the dual-passport holder (Brazil & Italy) used his left-foot to unleash a shot — that was less about power and more about timing and placement — which left the ‘keeper Subhashish Roy completely surprised.

A couple of minutes later, Andre Schembri, who was guilty of wasting chances upfront, came up with a strong curving shot that was saved by the ‘keeper.

Poor defending

But it was the result of poor defending by Heerings Kai that was the reason for Chennaiyin’s second goal. Instead of clearing the ball, Heerings’ feeble pass went straight to Valskis whose stinging left-foot shot found the target like a rocket.

In fact, Chennaiyin continued in the same vein raiding a hapless NEUFC defence umpteen number of times only to miss by a whisker.

Earlier, NEUFC had a good chance in the very first minute when Andrew Keogh of Ireland (playing in his first ISL match) shot feebly after receiving a pass from Martin Chaves. That was arguably the only notable opportunity for the visitor. From there on, it was Chennaiyin all the way.

Chennaiyin played an attractive brand of football especially in the first 15-odd minutes. Its passing and understanding between the midfield and front-line resulted in quite a few eye-catching moves.

Chennaiyin increased its points tally to 15 points from 12 matches and went up two places to sixth place while NEUFC remains on 11 points from 11 ties and is in ninth position.

305,2020/01/16,I-League | Gokulam ends winless run,"Gokulam Kerala FC ended its three-match winless run with an emphatic 3-1 win over home favourite East Bengal in an I-League fixture at the Kalyani Stadium here on Wednesday. Missing two players owing to suspension in the previous loss against Chennai City FC, Gokulam fielded six new names and that helped it get the first win after being without success for over a month.

East Bengal started positively but failed to convert some early opportunities. Gokulam was more successful in its approach and found the lead in the 21st minute when Henry Kisekka latched on to a Naocha Singh assist to net home. The host soon got back into the game with Kassim Aidara finding the equaliser in the 27th minute off a rebound.

Just before the break, a blunder by Marti Crespi saw East Bengal trailing again as the Spanish defender struck the ball into his own net to silence some 9000 home fans.

Despite dominating the proceedings after the break, East Bengal suffered another blow in the 65th minute when Kisekka released captain Marcus Joseph, who found the target off a second attempt after his first was blocked by East Bengal’s goalkeeper.

306,2020/01/16,Coppa Italia | Dybala inspires Juventus’ 4-0 rout of Udinese,"Juventus forward Paulo Dybala scored twice and was involved in a mesmerising exchange of passes to provide another for Gonzalo Higuain as the Turin side thumped Udinese 4-0 in the Coppa Italia on January 15.

AC Milan briefly forgot their Serie A troubles as they swept aside SPAL with a 3-0 victory in another last-16 match and Fiorentina ousted last season's runners-up Atalanta 2-1, scoring the winner while down to 10 men.

Juventus, missing Cristiano Ronaldo with sinusitis, went ahead with a delightful goal after 16 minutes that had all the hallmarks of their coach Maurizio Sarri.

A long passing move ended with Dybala and Higuain exchanging three successive one-twos to slice open the Udinese midfield before Higuain slotted the ball past goalkeeper Nicolas.

Dybala got on the scoresheet 10 minutes later, converting a penalty after Nicolas fouled Federico Bernardeschi and the Argentine curled in the third in the 58th minute.

A Douglas Costa penalty just after the hour completed the rout.

Krzysztof Piatek, Samu Castillejo and Theo Hernandez scored for Milan, who are a modest 10th in Serie A after a miserable season, while veteran striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic stayed on the bench.

Piatek ran on to Ismael Bennacer's pass to open the scoring after 20 minutes against Serie A's bottom-placed team, and the Pole provided the pass for Castillejo to curl in the second just before halftime.

Piatek missed two good chances after the break but it did not matter as Hernandez rifled in the third.

“It was a positive evening because the team interpreted the match well and played with the right intensity and quality,” said Milan coach Stefano Pioli,

Fiorentina's new signing Patrick Cutrone exchanged passes with Dalbert before firing them ahead after 11 minutes, his first goal since his move on loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Josip Ilicic scored against his old club to equalise in the 67th minute and Fiorentina had German Pezzella sent off as he received a second yellow card for diving.

Even so, Fiorentina won the match with six minutes left after Erick Pulgar released Pol Lirola on the right and he fired into the bottom corner.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/1xat2q/article30573222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dybala,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/coppa-italia-dybala-inspires-juventus-4-0-rout-of-udinese/article30573223.ece

Mata was played clean through by Anthony Martial and calmly chipped goalkeeper John Ruddy for the only goal against Premier League opponents who had a 10th-minute effort ruled out by VAR.

The first match at Molineux between the team, both in the last 32 of the Europa League, had ended goalless with United failing to land a single shot on target.

“The announcements in the Budget on February 1 could influence the voters. I was under pressure from within and outside the party to write to the Election Commission to stop the Central government from presenting the Budget on February 1, so that they can’t influence the election,” he said.

309,2020/01/16,JD(U) in talks with BJP over Delhi Assembly polls,"The Janata Dal (United) headed by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is exploring a tie-up with the BJP for the upcoming Assembly polls in Delhi, a senior leader said on Wednesday.

“I am in talks with the BJP leadership. Once things finalised, we will be in a position to share details such as seat-sharing,” JD(U) national general secretary Sanjay Jha disclosed this at a function held to mark Makar Sankranti here.

The JD(U) and the BJP are running a coalition government in Bihar since 2005, barring around a year half when the former was in power with the RJD and the Congress in the State. The JD(U) had dumped its alliance partners in July 2017, forming the State government in alliance with the BJP again.

At its last national executive held a year ago, the JD(U) had declared that it would go alone in the Assembly polls in Haryana, Jharkhand and Delhi. The party did contest alone in Haryana and Jharkhand, where it faced a rout, getting less than one per cent of the total polled votes.

Mr. Jha also took a swipe at the Rashtriya Janata Dal, headed by Lalu Prasad Yadav, which is exploring a tie-up with the Congress in Delhi.

“The RJD must tell the people of Delhi about its misrule in Bihar, which had forced millions of people from the State to migrate elsewhere and made them objects of ridicule,” said Mr. Jha, who is a close confidante of Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar.

Meanwhile, AICC in-charge for Bihar Shaktisinh Gohil said at a separate function that there was no problem in their alliance with the RJD. But there are serious problems between the BJP and the JD(U), he said.

310,2020/01/16,Mahaswami — towering icon of Dharma,"Embodiment of Truth — Kanchi Mahaswami, His Vision and Mission, the second volume of The Hindu’s publication on Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, 68th Pontiff of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam, was released on January 8, the day he attained siddhi 26 years ago. The first volume was released on the same day last year. Filled with news reports and articles on Mahaswami, culled from The Hindu Archives, the sequel traces his life from 1942-1994, the major part of which he spent walking the length and breadth of the country to propagate Sanatana Dharma. The Hindu had covered the movements of the unparalleled service of the sage reporting from various places and paying sumptuous tribute on important occasions — golden jubilee of his ascension, when he completes 60 years and so on.

Born in 1894 and anointed when he was least prepared at age 13, the Acharya found himself facing the unenviable task of boosting the morale of the followers of the Math, which had lost two leaders in quick succession. The country was in the throes of Freedom Struggle and uncertainty prevailed. Resources were meagre and the incumbent had to first complete his education on all fronts. A caretaker administration was in charge until he turned 21. Against all these odds, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati set out to meet people at the grassroots level and thus began a journey, which took him to cities and villages, palaces and huts. One day he was the guest of a king and the next he rested at a roadside temple in ruins. The sage walked, several km a day, for years in scorching sun and pouring rain.

The first volume stopped as the sage returns to Kumbakonam in 1939, after completing a yatra up to Varanasi, during which he is received with warmth and affection in all the States. In the second part, the Acharya leaves the comfort of the Math in 1942, proceeding on another journey across the country. Sri Jayendra Saraswati is chosen successor and the senior Acharya retires into the calm surroundings of Sivasthanam. He emerges in 1978, at the age of 84, to embark on another marathon Padayatra. His vigour undiminished, he walks 5,000 km across several States and returns in 1984 with Sri Jayendra Saraswati and his disciple Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati. He remains in Kanchipuram until his siddi in 1994. Many are the schemes he initiates to for human welfare, a number of them to protect the Vedas and Vaidikas, cows and heritage.

Special articles

Apart from the pictures and news clippings, which tell the tale of a remarkable saint and a legacy started 2,500 years ago by Adi Sankara, the book contains special articles exclusively sourced. Most poignant among them is the account of Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati, present head of the Pitam, who reminisces about his Paramaguru, a towering icon of Truth and Dharma. His greatness, however, lay in his simplicity and the equality with which he treated his devotees, recalls the 70th Pontiff. Copies of the volume, which is accompanied by two posters, are available at the Chennai book fair and The Hindu office at Kasturi Buildings.

311,2020/01/16,In a dystopian society,"There is no dearth of exquisitely rendered and gripping novels in Urdu. Still, hardly any Urdu novelist has attempted to bring about an engrossing critique of a society where android appliances produce ever-increasing interest in the users’ generated content and entertainment.

The perils of a world where history is not more than data which needs constant updating can only be depicted through a dystopian novel that, as opposed to a utopia, sews up a multilayered narrative of an imagined world where all our frightening dreams come true.

It sets up “Animal Farm”, “1984”, “Brave New World”, “Fahrenheit 451” and “The Handmaid’s Tale”. In line with awe-inspiring novels, the celebrated and prolific Urdu novelist Musharraf Alam Zauqi maps a new terrain of his creativity by producing perhaps the first dystopian novel in Urdu, “Marge Anboh” (Mass Death) that has been creating waves in the subcontinent.

Modelled on the Orwellian structure, Zauqi’s latest novel manifests a nuanced sense of bewilderment caused by living in a country that knows nothing more than buying and selling, It is a technology-driven society where people long for physical pleasures and sensual gratification. The widespread acceptance of the Orwellian adage, “All animals are equals, but some are more equal than others”, which results in rampant discrimination and injustice prompts immensely popular novelist to understand how a much- talked about the effort to usher in better days causes unbearable miseries and disastrous decline at all levels.

Skilfully divided into five chapters, the novel explains the deeper meaning of the much-touted nationalism. It begins with reproducing Serveshwar Dayal Saxena’s poem that says, “Country is not a map drawn on the paper/ murder of a boy, Death of a women/the body of a man riddled with gunshots/ Not only for the government, but it is also dangerous for the whole country/ if this land does not run like fire in your blood/ you must realise that you have become infertile/ you have no right to breathe here. At the outset, Zauqi refers to Steve Jobs for whom the most significant invention of life was death to embrace all the contradictions that develop a unique philosophy of the new generation.

A 20-year-old student Pasha Mirza, a proud resident of ‘Youngistan’, revels in sexually driven and self-righteous life. The painful decimation of values and the loss of individuality and constant reliance on technology take the children to a place not habituated by fairies and goblins but where lethal toys and life-threatening mischiefs abound.

Here everyone is reduced to a consumer good like toothpaste, cricket bat, football, instant noodles, and pizza and dangers of conformity writ large.

Pasha Mirza and his friend Raymond feel attracted to the Illuminati who draw power from the evil spirit. For them, death is the most enthralling fantasy, and Blue Whale games provide an exhilarating experience to them. Pasha, Raymond, Gracey, Puneet, Sara Jahangir, and Puneet don't blurt out guilt-ridden confessions. Still, their utterances and actions string together a multi-linear narrative of angst, stress, discrimination, chaos, hope, and despair that stirs rage and pity and thrills and torments us simultaneously. Many seek their life in ruins, and long estrangements with their parents and family hardly rack them.

Zauqi, who won the prestigious Majlis-e Farogh-e Urdu Adab Award, Doha has brought about a scathing critique as a response to the regime that is dehumanising, frightening and savagely oppressive. Mob lynching is hardly reckoned more than a delinquency.

The subsequent chapters, “Jahangir Mirza’s diary”, “Facing Death”, “Marge Anboh” and “Walking in Sleep” (the last part of Pasha Mirza’s story) delve deeply into the everyday life of the society where fascism and capitalism created the all-powerful spectre of jingoism. The heart -wrenching tales of a community show Zauqis commitment to the silenced and the dispossessed all over the world.

The author astutely lumped together poignant stories that depict a sense of belonging and a sense of alienation tersely. For the author, the contemporary political discourse set in motion by the omnipresent magician is a many-tiered affair, which has the potential to be a roller coaster of emotional experience. It is about carved wounds that are not still healed.

Delineating the theme of the novel Zauqi remarks, “ ‘Marge Anboh’ revolves around a son and his father. It is about the generation gap, serious acrimonies overwhelmed the small grudges. Villain turned hero, innocent became criminals. Do only Orhan Pamuk and Arundhati Roy have the licence to zero in on this political play?” No, Zauqi too is gifted with a marked sense of resourceful inventiveness and that enabled him to bring forward such a pulsating and intriguing dystopian novel which is destined to blaze a new trail in Urdu fiction.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/hgauo0/article30576637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/74692492102202349513248827448656125257318400n-1,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/in-a-dystopian-society/article30576638.ece
312,2020/01/16,Cube — The Reading Nest is the space to study without getting distracted,"The capital city is home to co-working spaces, performance spaces and places to learn, create or share your stories. A new space that has opened up is meant for students to work without any disruptions. If you are above 18 and is on the lookout for a place to study or prepare for any competitive exam, then check out Cube — The Reading Nest.

Located along Sasthamangalam-Vellayambalam stretch, it has been conceptualised by Kavitha Niroop and Krishnakumar Prem, life-skills and soft-skills trainers. “The air-conditioned room has individual cabins, free Wi-Fi and a separate section for group discussions. We also stock newspapers and magazines. There is a coffee room as well,” says Kavitha.

Krishnakumar says that it was his stint in Delhi while preparing for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examinations that introduced him to the concept of reading rooms. “Such spaces are common in Delhi and they are extremely helpful for students. Now that our city has evolved as an education hub with scores of coaching centres for various competitive exams, we thought a reading room is the need of the hour. Some may not have the facility at home. Or, if they opt to sit in open spaces such as a park, there are bound to be several distractions,” he says.

Kavitha adds that some of these students hail from other districts or even outside the state. Since many of them share accommodation, they might find it difficult to concentrate on their studies and a reading room would be of help to them.

“Those appearing for exams conducted by the Public Service Commission (PSC) and the Kerala Administrative Service (KAS) and even those pursuing professional courses such as medicine can make use of this. In future, we plan to give training in aptitude tests for those appearing for competitive exams conducted by the UPSC, the KAS and the PSC,” Krishnakumar says.

Cube has 28 cabins and users have already started frequenting the room. Gopika Rejith, a civil service aspirant from Ernakulam says: “Although my coaching centre has reading rooms, since there are multiple batches of students there is always a rush and I am not comfortable with that. So I chose to come here,” she says.

Inspired to focus

P Anand Mohan, a resident of Kannammoola in the city, comes here because he wanted to get out of the comforts of his home. “So many distractions at home! Also, I am tempted to take a power nap after a few hours of studying! But here I am pushed to make the best use of my time and with a cabin to myself, I get inspired to focus. I spent nearly 10 hours here,” says Anand, who is preparing for the civil service prelims.

The space is open from 7 am to 9 pm. Monthly user fee is ₹1,000.

313,2020/01/16,"Sea level rise to impact more population in Asia, including India: Moody’s report","The rise in sea level due to global warming will impact more people in Asian countries than any other region, Moody’s said in a report on the consequences of this inevitability and credit risk to such sovereign nations.

Stating that Sovereigns in Asia, Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and small islands were most exposed to rising sea levels, Moody’s said “ In absolute terms, the largest populations exposed are in Asia, including Bangladesh (Ba3 stable), China (A1 stable), Indonesia (Baa2 stable), and India (Baa2 negative).”

“Some high-income economies, such as Japan (A1 stable) and the Netherlands (Aaa stable), also feature,” it added.

Moody’s said the sea level rise posed long-term credit threat to the identified countries as the consequence of climate change was a steady increase in sea levels.

While there was a high degree of uncertainty about the magnitude, the direction of change was not in question — sea levels several decades from now would be largely determined by past greenhouse gas emissions and temperatures, it said.

“Sea level rise is gradual, but manifests abruptly, by intensifying the frequency and severity of storm surges, flooding and tropical cyclones, which have credit implications for sovereigns,” the credit rating agency said.

It said countries, including Vietnam (Ba3 negative), the Bahamas (Baa3 stable), Egypt (B2 stable), Suriname (B2 stable) and some in the Gulf were highlighted, with up to 10%-25% of the population or GDP exposed.

“Island sovereigns are not always in scope, but analyses of “locked-in” sea level rise in particular highlight the Cayman Islands (Aa3 stable), Maldives (B2 negative) and Fiji (Ba3 stable), with 80% or more of the population exposed,” it said.

According to Moody’s the credit implications are wide-ranging, including economic and social repercussions of lost income, damage to assets, loss of life, health issues and forced migration from the sudden events related to sea level rise are immediate.

“The main credit channels for sovereigns are economic and fiscal strength. Vulnerability to extreme events related to sea level rise can also undermine investment and heighten susceptibility to event risk, by hindering the ability of governments to borrow to rebuild, increasing losses for banks, raising external pressures, and/or amplifying political risk as populations come under stress,” Moody’s said.

“While one isolated shock related to sea level rise is unlikely to materially weaken a sovereign’s credit profile, repeated shocks could do,” it said.

“Through our assessment of exposure and credit impact, we find that Vietnam, Egypt, Suriname and a number of small islands face material credit risk. The extent of risk will be determined by the pace of increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters related to sea level rise, which is currently highly uncertain, and by the effectiveness of adaptation measures, so far largely untested,” it added.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/1z2bjz/article29232276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOODY,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/sea-level-rise-to-impact-more-population-in-asia-including-india-moodys-report/article30573413.ece
314,2020/01/16,"TB diagnostic test developed in India has high accuracy, says WHO","In a Rapid Communication published on January 14, the World Health Organization (WHO) had mentioned that the India-made Truenat MTB, a molecular diagnostic test for pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB and rifampicin-resistant TB, has high accuracy.

Truenat MTB has “high diagnostic accuracy as initial test to diagnose TB and to sequentially detect rifampicin resistance”, says the WHO Communication. It will be used as an initial test thus replacing sputum smear microscopy.

Truenat is developed by the Goa-based Molbio Diagnostics. The company was provided with technical assistance and resources by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) to help commercialise Truenat. ICMR had assessed and validated the diagnostic tool.

“Truenat will be cheaper per test than Xpert. The equipment and cartridges cost more in the case of Xpert,” says Prof. Balaram Bhargava, Director-General of ICMR. “Truenat is robust and most suited for Indian conditions.”

“With its better sensitivity, Truenat can be used as the initial tool for TB diagnosis,” says Prof. Bhargava.

Besides other studies, a multi-centric, prospective field evaluation study was carried out in India, Ethiopia, Peru, Papua New Guinea involving 744 participants, with final results on bacteriological culture.

Higher sensitivity

While sputum microscopy has only about 50% sensitivity, Truenat has been found to have higher sensitivity and specificity. According to WHO, the overall sensitivity of the Truenat MTB assay is 83% and specificity is 99%. In the case of Truenat MTBPlus, which uses two targets to diagnose TB bacteria, the sensitivity increases to 89% and the specificity is 98%.

In comparison, Xpert, which is also a molecular diagnostic test and has been widely used across the world, the sensitivity is 85% and specificity is 98%.

In cases where the sample is found to be positive, tests can be done to know if the TB bacteria are already resistant to rifampicin, a drug used as part of first-line treatment. Truenat MTB-RIF test for knowing the resistance has 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity.

According to WHO, the accuracy of Truenat and Truenat MTB Plus is comparable with Xpert and Xpert Ultra. Likewise, the accuracy to detect rifampicin resistance using Truenat MTB-RIF is comparable with Xpert and Xpert Ultra.

Better than smear microscopy

Based on data available from around 230 diagnosing units in the primary and community health centres in Andhra Pradesh, scientists at the Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology found Truenat had better ability to diagnose more TB positive cases. “Compared with smear microscopy, there was 30% more number of positive cases diagnosed after Truenat was implemented in the 230-odd units,” says Dr. Manoj V. Murhekar, Director of NIE.

“Instead of smear microscopy, Truenat can be used as an initial and point-of-care tool for diagnosing TB,” he says. “Since not much expertise is needed to carry out the test, it can be used in peripheral units such as public and community health centres.”

Battery operated

While Xpert needs reliable electricity supply and air-conditioning, Truenat is battery operated and portable, hence, it can be used in remote places. Truenat takes about 25 minutes to extract the DNA and another 35 minutes for diagnosis. Testing for rifampicin resistance takes an hour and is done only if the sample tests positive for TB. In the case of Xpert, it takes two hours to complete the diagnosis and test for rifampicin resistance.

Compared with a one ml of sputum sample required in the case of Xpert, only 0.5 ml sample is needed for Truenat. In the case of TB positive samples, the actual bacterial load in 1 ml of sputum sample is given, while Xpert provides only a qualitative result.

Low cost

The main cost advantage while using Truenat will be in the manner the tests are carried out. Only when samples test positive will the test for rifampicin resistance be carried out in the case of Truenat. This is unlike Xpert where both TB diagnosis and rifampicin resistance test are done in one go. Hence the use of reagents may be reduced and will help make the testing cheaper when Truenat is used.

Also, a peripheral-level TB test using Truenat will reduce the delay in diagnosis and when combined with improved treatment initiation rates will fare better compared with district-level Xpert testing. After all, early diagnosis and treatment initiation will help reduce TB transmission and incidence.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/9cppys/article30577818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-tb-prasad-1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/tb-diagnostic-test-developed-in-india-has-high-accuracy-says-who/article30577819.ece
