0,2020/01/01,Sindhu targets Olympics gold,"World champion P.V. Sindhu said it is time to look ahead, leave the past, believe in herself and come back much more stronger.

Sindhu, a star campaigner for Hyderabad Hunters, is also looking at the Premier Badminton League starting on January 20 to fine-tune her game as she targets the top slot for India for the Tokyo Olympics.

“Post the World championship gold last August, no doubt I have had a disappointing run. But it is not all over. I can always comeback,” the 24-year-old Sindhu said in an exclusive interview with The Hindu as she shared her thoughts for the new year.

Was 2019 better than 2016 when you won the Rio Olympics silver?

In 2016, no one expected me to do well. Now there is a lot more recognition, expectations are high and with that comes bigger responsibility. So both years are different but with great memories.

Essentially, I am keen to start off the new year on a high in the Malaysian Open and the Indonesia Masters this month though it is not possible always to keep winning every tournament.

Is there a critical review of your game at the end of 2019?

Yes, of course. It is important to know your mistakes and work on them. I am looking to be lot more patient now in my approach even as the other aspects of the game are being taken care off during the daily training sessions.

What are the three goals you are chasing now?

The Tokyo Olympics gold, World No.1 ranking and winning a few Super Series titles including the All England.

Your thoughts on the PBL.

This is going to be a different PBL. There are a new set of players. Matches against World No. 2 Tai Tzu Ying (for Bengaluru Raptors) should be interesting, looking forward to them. The league has always been very interesting, lots of fun and excitement in the air.

The whole atmosphere is different out there in PBL as you play for yourself and also for the team. The support too will be different and importantly you can correct mistakes, if any.

On playing for Hunters.

We have to support each other and play like a team to clinch the title.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/xr2wtq/article30452386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02SINDHU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/sindhu-targets-olympics-gold/article30452387.ece

6,2020/01/01,Smartphones face high hacking risk in 2020: Report,"There was a 54% increase in data breaches in 2019 as compared to 2018, and 2020 will see a significant rise in the number of mobile-focused malware and banking Trojans, a new report has predicted.

With 5G and Internet of Things (IoT) devices arriving on the horizon, data speed will increase but the speed of cyber attacks would also rise, said the report from leading accounting and consulting firm Grant Thornton.

“Threat actors are expected to deploy advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI)-led attacks to boost the speed and impact of their campaigns. IoT will throw new challenges to data security,” said the report titled ‘Cyber Trends in 2019 and Predictions for 2020’

“Cyber attacks are on the rise and will continue to rise. It’s not a matter of if but a matter of when. A framework-driven approach with continuous monitoring will help companies mature their cybersecurity posture and address incidents pro-actively,” said Akshay Garkel, Partner, Cybersecurity & IT Risk Advisory, Grant Thornton India LLP.

According to the report, cybersecurity incidents, including cyber bullying, have skyrocketed by more than six times from the last year and data analytics will be critical to predict crime patterns and to reduce cybercrimes.

The report expects the number of smartphone users in India to reach 673 million this year.

“Ninety-five per cent of cybersecurity breaches are expected to arise due to human error. Human-centric security continues to be a major concern and requires people-centric solutions as well as technology,” the findings showed.

In 2019, 4.3 billion estimated records were breached as 34% of reported cybersecurity breaches involved internal actors.

“Every 14 seconds, a ransomware attack was carried out on companies in 2019, while 71% of reported breaches were financially motivated,” the report said.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/viyim2/article30450910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01NETPHONEBREACH,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/smartphones-face-high-hacking-risk-in-2020-report/article30450912.ece

9,2020/01/01,Apple granted patent for virtual speakers anywhere in room,"Apple has been granted a new patent for virtual speakers in MacBook that can simulate sounds from anywhere in the room, making the users feel as if sound is coming from a different place than loudspeakers.

According to a report in 9to5Mac, it’s a virtual acoustic system that works by using “crosstalk cancelling” technology, which is a similar technique to noise-cancellation found in Apple AirPods Pro.

Crosstalk refers to the overlapping sound waves that the ears receive from the left and right channels of a speaker.

The effect is to allow audio signals to contain “spatial cues” that let a sound be positioned virtually in a space.

Apple has been granted a patent on the Crosstalk technology by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office that could bring new, more immersive audio applications in the future.

The tech giant originally filed for the patent in 2018.

10,2020/01/01,Pope Francis apologises for slapping woman's hand,"Pope Francis apologised on Wednesday for slapping a woman, who had grabbed him as he greeted a crowd of devotees, shortly before he delivered a speech denouncing “every form of violence against women.”

The image of a visibly annoyed Pope Francis slapping his way free from the clutches of an admirer as he walked by Catholic faithful on New Year’s Eve instantly went viral on social media.

An apology followed. “We lose patience many times,” the Pope confessed.

“It happens to me too. I apologise for the bad example given yesterday,” the head of the Catholic church said before celebrating Mass at the Vatican.

12,2020/01/01,Iran’s Khamenei condemns U.S. ‘malice’ over Iraq strikes,"Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday condemned U.S. air strikes on a militant group in Iraq.

“The Iranian govt & nation & I strongly condemn the U.S.’s malice,” Mr. Khamenei said in a Tweet, referring to Sunday’s deadly U.S. strikes on the Hashed al-Shaabi militants.

The U.S. carried out the strike in western Iraq in retaliation for rocket fire that killed an American civilian contractor at a military base in northern Iraq on Friday.

In a tweet on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Iran of “orchestrating” that day’s storming of the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.

In response, Mr. Khamenei said: “That guy has tweeted that we (the United States) see Iran responsible for the events in Baghdad & we will respond to Iran”.

“First, you can’t do anything. Second, if you were logical — which you’re not — you’d see that your crimes in Iraq, Afghanistan... have made nations hate you,” he tweeted.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dgynbf/article30453348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Ali-Khamenei,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/irans-khamenei-condemns-us-malice-over-iraq-strikes/article30453349.ece
13,2020/01/01,Protesters end siege of U.S. Embassy in Baghdad,"Pro-Iran demonstrators left the besieged U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Wednesday after the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force ordered them to withdraw a day after their dramatic incursion.

Thousands of Iraqi supporters of the largely Iranian-trained Hashed had encircled and vandalised the Embassy compound on Tuesday, outraged by U.S. air strikes that killed 25 Hashed fighters over the weekend.

They marched unimpeded through the checkpoints of the usually high-security Green Zone to the Embassy gates, where they broke through a reception area, chanting “Death to America” and spraying pro-Iran graffiti on the walls.

Iraq’s caretaker Premier Adel Abdel Mahdi called on the angry crowd to leave the Embassy but most spent the night in dozens of tents set up outside the perimetre wall. On Wednesday morning, crowds of men brandished the Hashed’s colours, torched U.S. flags and hurled rocks towards the compound. Security personnel inside responded with tear gas, wounding at least 20 people, the Hashed said.

By the afternoon, the Hashed called on its supporters to leave the Embassy and regroup outside the Green Zone “out of respect for the state”.

“You delivered your message,” it said in a statement.

AFP's photographer saw protesters dismantling their tents and leaving the Green Zone. “We burned them!” they said, streaming back out of checkpoints they had breezed through on Tuesday.

Kataeb Hezbollah, the group targeted in the U.S. raids, initially told AFP it would stay at the Embassy. But the group's spokesman Mohammad Mohyeddin later said it had decided to abide by the Hashed’s order. “We scored a huge win: we arrived at the U.S. Embassy, which no one had done before,” he told AFP.

Spiralling tensions

“Now, the ball is in Parliament's court,” Moyheddin added, referring to lawmakers’ efforts to revoke the legal cover for 5,200 U.S. troops to deploy in Iraq.

Tuesday’s Embassy attack was the latest episode in spiralling tensions between the U.S. and Iran since Washington abandoned a landmark nuclear deal with Tehran in 2018.

Many of those tensions have played out in Iraq, which has close ties with both governments.

U.S. forces have faced a spate of rocket attacks in recent months, blaming them on pro-Iran Hashed factions.

Last week, one of those attacks killed a U.S. contractor, prompting the retaliatory U.S. air strikes that killed 25 fighters from Kataeb Hezbollah (Hezbollah Brigades).

President Donald Trump and other US officials have blamed Iran for attacks on U.S. forces and the Embassy.

By Wednesday, Iraqi forces had reimposed normal security measures around the perimetre of the Green Zone, usually inaccessible without a badge.

U.S. officials were alarmed that protesters crossed checkpoints so easily on Tuesday.

An Iraqi special forces fighter assigned to guard the Green Zone told AFP his units had no orders to intervene. “If I had had orders to act, I could have fired and stopped the storming of the Embassy,” he said. “But after what happened, our hands are tied. We can't prevent the situation from deteriorating,” he added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y23h2d/article30453213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Iraq-embassy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/protesters-end-siege-of-us-embassy-in-baghdad/article30453214.ece
14,2020/01/01,"9 dead, thousands caught in flooding in Indonesia’s capital","Severe flooding hit Indonesia’s capital as residents were celebrating the New Year’s, killing at least nine people, displacing thousands and forcing the closure of a domestic airport.

Tens of thousands of revellers in Jakarta were soaked by torrential rains as they waited for New Year’s Eve fireworks.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said on Wednesday that monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 90 neighbourhoods and triggered a landslide in Depok, a city on the outskirts of Jakarta.

Mr. Wibowo said the dead included a 16-year-old high school student who was electrocuted, while more than 19,000 people were in temporary shelters after floodwaters reached up to 3 metres (10 feet) in several places.

Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan told reporters after conducting an aerial survey over the flooded city that as much as 370 millimetres (14.5 inches) of rainfall — more than three times the average amount — was recorded in Jakarta and West Java’s hilly areas during the New Year’s Eve, resulting in the Ciliwung and Cisadane rivers overflowing.

Television footage and photos released by the agency showed dozens of cars floating in muddy waters, while soldiers and rescuers in rubber boats were struggling to evacuate children and the elderly who were holding out on the roofs of their squalid houses.

The floods inundated thousands of homes and buildings in poor and wealthy districts alike, forcing authorities to cut off electricity and water supplies and paralysing transport networks, Mr. Wibowo said.

Director General of Civil Aviation Polana Pramesti said the floods also submerged the runway at Jakarta’s Halim Perdanakusumah domestic airport, prompting authorities to close it and stranding some 19,000 passengers.

Flooding also highlighted Indonesia’s infrastructure problems as it tries to attract foreign investment.

Jakarta is home to 10 million people, or 30 million including those in its greater metropolitan area. It is prone to earthquakes and flooding and is rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled extraction of ground water. Congestion is also estimated to cost the economy $6.5 billion a year.

15,2020/01/01,Brexit: PM Johnson vows to take U.K. out of European Union,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed that the first item on his agenda in 2020 is to fulfil the will of the electorate and to conclude the U.K.’s divorce deal with the European Union within this month.

In his new year message, Mr. Johnson, who is currently on holiday in the Caribbean, said he hoped the country would “move forward united” after it leaves the 28-member bloc on January 31.

Mr. Johnson, who was re-elected in the December 12 General Elections said the “first item on his agenda” when he returned to London was delivering on the mandate of the people and taking the U.K. out of the EU.

He vowed to govern “for everyone”, not just those who backed him and the Conservative Party at the highly-divisive polls.

“As we say goodbye to 2019 we can also turn the page on the division, rancour and uncertainty which has dominated public life and held us back for far too long,” he said.

The Conservatives’ resounding election victory has “driven an electoral bulldozer” through the deadlock in Parliament, the Prime Minister said, and offered a way out of the “division, rancour and uncertainty” surrounding the Brexit debate since the landmark 2016 referendum vote.

Legislation to ratify the withdrawal agreement with the EU easily cleared its first hurdle before Christmas, when MPs backed it by a majority of 124.

With an 80-seat Conservative majority in the House of Commons, the remaining stages of the bill are expected to be completed quickly in January in time, he PM said, to “get Brexit done before the end of this month.”

“We can start a new chapter in the history of our country, in which we come together and move forward united, unleashing the enormous potential of the British people,” he said.

He noted that Britain’s exit from the EU should have happened already, but “we were thwarted by a Parliament determined to use every trick in the book to stop us leaving the EU“.

“Now we have a new Parliament, elected by the people to deliver the people’s priorities, which will finally respect the referendum and deliver Brexit,” the 55-year-old Prime Minister said.

“We will get Brexit done before the end of this month. That oven-ready deal I talked about so much during the election campaign has already had its plastic covering pierced and been placed in the microwave,” he said.

While the U.K. is set to leave the EU’s institutions on January 31, negotiations over its future economic relationship with the bloc have yet to begin, with experts quoted by the BBC saying they will be far tougher than those over the terms of the U.K.’s exit.

Mr. Johnson has set himself a deadline of completing an ambitious trade deal by the end of 2020, when the 11-month transition period agreed by the two sides ends. Many leading EU figures have cast doubt upon the tight timetable and questioned the Prime Minister’s ruling out of any extension.

Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn, the vanquished leader of the Opposition Labour Party, in his new year message, acknowledged that the party faced tough times ahead after its fourth defeat in a row but its movement remained “very strong“.

In his new year message, Mr. Corbyn did not make any direct reference to the election rout or his own future. However, he noted that 2019 had been “quite the year for our country and for our Labour movement“.

The Labour just got 203 seats, a disastrous performance for the party in decades that forced the 70-year-old leader to announce that he would not lead the party in the next election.

While the party is set to be out of power for at least another four years, he said Labour must continue to make its influence felt and stand up for its values.

“It won’t be easy,” he said. “But we have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson. We will be campaigning every day. We will be on the front line, both in Parliament and on the streets.”

With the contest to succeed him expected to take about three months, Mr. Corbyn is set to continue leading the party in Parliament and the country until the spring.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e0susn/article30452293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAIN-ELECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brexit-pm-johnson-vows-to-take-uk-out-of-european-union/article30452294.ece
16,2020/01/01,"Taliban target Afghan security forces, killing 26: Officials","The Taliban unleashed a new wave of attacks in northern Afghanistan, targeting members of the country’s security forces and killing at least 26, local officials said on Wednesday.

The insurgents quickly claimed responsibility for all the attack. The Taliban today hold sway over practically half of Afghanistan, staging near-daily attacks that target soldiers, security forces and government officials but also kill scores of civilians.

In northern Kunduz province, at least 10 Afghan forces were killed and four others were wounded in an attack on a police checkpoint in the district of Dashti Archi late on Tuesday night, according to Mohammad Yusouf Ayubi, the head of provincial council.

And in Balkh province, the Taliban killed nine police officers in an attack on their checkpoint.

The fate of four other policemen who were at the checkpoint was unknown, said Mohammad Afzel Hadid, head of the provincial council.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, claimed that the insurgents in the Balkh attack had infiltrated police ranks from a while ago, waiting for a chance to strike.

Though the Taliban often exaggerate their claims, the insurgents also on occasion disguise themselves in Afghan uniforms to get easier access to their targets.

In a third attack on Tuesday night, a gunbattle with the Taliban killed seven members of the security forces in Takhar province, according to Jawad Hajri, the provincial governor’s spokesman.

He said 10 Taliban fighters were also killed.

The shootout took place in Darqad district after the security forces had successfully cleared out the Taliban from several other districts in the past week, said Mr. Hajri.

Fighting was still underway there on Wednesday, he added, The Taliban have intensified their attacks in northern Afghanistan in recent days.

They struck a pro-government militia compound in Jawzjan province before dawn on Monday, killing 14 members of the Afghan security forces.

A similar militia compound was targeted in Takhar on Sunday, when at least 17 militiamen were killed.

On Friday, at least 10 Afghan soldiers died in a Taliban attack on a checkpoint in southern Helmand province.

The latest Taliban attacks underscore that the insurgents are at their strongest in the 18-year war, America’s longest conflict, even as their leadership, based in the Arab Gulf state of Qatar, has been negotiating with a US envoy.

Washington has demanded that a cease-fire take place before any peace agreement could be signed.

The fighting has shown no signs of abating.

U.S. airstrikes and operations by Afghan security forces over the past two days killed 35 Taliban fighters in offensives across the country, including an airstrike in Kandahar province that killed 11 Taliban insurgents, the US military said.

Several Taliban were also detained, the U.S. military added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3ehko/article30451824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AFGHANISTAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taliban-target-afghan-security-forces-killing-26-officials/article30451825.ece
17,2020/01/01,Police attack crowds with rounds of tear gas in Hong Kong,"A peaceful march drawing tens of thousands of anti-government protesters on New Year's Day spiralled into chaos. This was because the police fired several rounds of tear gas at crowds including families. Some protesters threw several petrol bombs too.

The violence broke out during a largely peaceful march as masses of regular citizens pressed authorities for further concessions in the Chinese-ruled city.

In the Wanchai bar district, some protesters had spray-painted graffiti and smashed cash machines in an HSBC bank branch when plainclothes police moved in, pepper-spraying crowds in a tense face-off, after which several rounds of tear gas were fired.

The protesters, many masked and clad in black, re-grouped and formed their own line, hurling several petrol bombs and unfurling umbrellas.

Protesters have directed their ire at the global banking group HSBC saying that it had closed an account that had been a fund-raising platform for the protest movement, a claim the bank has strongly denied.

Earlier in the day, under grey clouds, citizens young and old, carried signs such as “Freedom is not free” before setting off.

Thousands of Hong Kong revellers had earlier welcomed in 2020 on neon-lit promenades along the skyline of Victoria Harbour, chanting the movement's signature slogan - “Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our Time” - for the final seconds before clocks struck midnight.

A sea of protesters then surged down Nathan Road, a major boulevard, blocking all lanes in a spontaneous march breaking out within minutes of the new decade. Some held signs reading ”Lets keep fighting together in 2020.”

“It's hard to utter 'Happy New Year' because Hong Kong people are not happy,” said a man named Tung, who was walking with his two-year-old son, mother and niece.

“Unless the five demands are achieved, and police are held accountable for their brutality, we can't have a real happy new year,” he added.

He was referring to the push for concessions from the government including full democracy, an amnesty for the more than 6,500 people arrested so far, and a powerful, independent investigation into police actions.

The pro-democracy march is being organised by the Civil Human Rights Front, a group that arranged a number of marches last year that drew millions.

Along the route, a number of newly elected pro-democracy district politicians mingled with the crowds on their first day in office.

“The government has already started the oppression before the New Year began ... whoever is being oppressed, we will stand with them,” said Jimmy Sham, one of the leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front.

Overnight, police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons during some brief standoffs.

China's President Xi Jinping said in a New Year's speech that Beijing will “resolutely safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong under the so-called ‘one country, two systems framework”.

Many people in Hong Kong are angered by Beijing's tight grip on the city which was promised a high degree of autonomy under this framework when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

Beijing denies interference and blames the West for fomenting the unrest.

A group of 40 parliamentarians and dignitaries from 18 countries had written an open letter to Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam on New Year's Eve, urging her to “seek genuine ways forward out of this crisis by addressing the grievances of Hong Kong people.”

The protest movement is supported by 59% of the city's residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute.

“Our worst fears have been realised,” the zoo, which specialises in primates, announced on its Facebook page.

Police said at least 30 of the animals had died.

The blaze destroyed the monkey enclosure, which opened in 1975, shortly before midnight.

19,2020/01/01,Taiwan leader rejects China's offer to unify under Hong Kong model,"Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on January 1 the island would not accept a “one country, two systems” political formula Beijing has suggested could be used to unify the democratic island, saying such an arrangement had failed in Hong Kong.

China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary. Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

Tsai, who's seeking re-election in a January 11 vote, also vowed in a New Year's speech to defend Taiwan's sovereignty, saying her government would build a mechanism to safeguard freedom and democracy as Beijing ramps up pressure on the island. Fear of China has become a major element in the campaign, boosted by months of anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.

“Hong Kong people have showed us that 'one country, two systems' is definitely not feasible,” Tsai said, referring to the political arrangement that guaranteed certain freedoms in the former British colony of Hong Kong after it was returned to China in 1997. “Under 'one country, two systems', the situation continues to deteriorate in Hong Kong. The credibility of 'one country, two systems' has been sullied by the government's abuse of power,” Tsai said.

Hong Kong has been hit by months of anti-government protests triggered by widespread resentment of perceived efforts by Beijing to exert control of the city despite the promises of autonomy. Taiwan's parliament passed an anti-infiltration law on Tuesday to combat perceived threats from China, further straining ties between Taiwan and Beijing.

Tsai said the law will protect Taiwan's democracy and cross-strait exchanges will not be affected amid worries that the legislation may damage business ties with China.

China suspects Tsai and her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party of pushing for the island's formal independence, and has threatened it with war if there was any such move.

Tsai denies seeking independence and reiterated that she would not unilaterally change the status quo with China.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5hp0a1/article28707086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THRDTAIWAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taiwan-leader-rejects-chinas-offer-to-unify-under-hong-kong-model/article30449979.ece
20,2020/01/01,Trump to announce new strategy to tackle underage vaping,"President Donald Trump said on December 31 that the federal government will soon announce a new strategy to tackle underage vaping, promising, “We’re going to protect our families, we’re going to protect our children, and we’re going to protect the industry.”

Trump was vague about what the plan would entail, but suggested “certain flavors” in cartridge-based e-cigarettes would be taken off the market “for a period of time.”

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the Food and Drug Administration would ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes, such as those sold by Juul and NJOY. E-cigarette pods formulated to taste like tobacco or menthol would still be allowed.

The Journal also reported that tank-based vaping systems, which are less popular among teenagers, would still allow users to custom-mix flavors.

In September, Trump and his top health officials said they would soon sweep virtually all flavored e-cigarettes from the market because of their appeal to young children and teens. But that effort stalled after vaping lobbyists pushed back and White House advisers told Trump the ban could cost him votes with adults who vape.

On Tuesday, Trump suggested a ban of flavored e-cigarettes might be temporary. “Hopefully, if everything’s safe, they’re going to be going very quickly back onto the market,” he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, where he was hosting a New Year’s Eve party.

""People have died from this, they died from vaping,” the President said. “We think we understand why. But we’re doing a very exhaustive examination and hopefully everything will be back on the market very, very shortly.”

But the FDA had already announced that, starting in May, all e-cigarettes will need to undergo a review. And only those that can demonstrate a benefit for U.S. public health will be permitted to stay on the market.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/j0f47v/article29452476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-ECIGARETTES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-to-announce-a-new-strategy-to-tackle-underage-vaping/article30449033.ece

22,2020/01/01,"Three dead, several missing as Australia counts the cost of devastating bushfires","Australian authorities on January 1 confirmed a third person had died in the devastating bushfires that engulfed the southeast coastal region this week and said a fourth person was missing and feared dead.

Fanned by soaring temperatures, columns of fire and smoke blackened entire towns on December 30 and 31, forcing thousands of residents and holidaymakers to seek shelter on beaches. Many stood in shallow water to escape the flames.

In total, there have been 12 fire-related deaths across Australia since blazes broke out a few months ago, including three volunteer firefighters, after a three-year drought in large parts of the nation created tinder-dry conditions.

Huge bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres) — an area larger than Japan — and new blazes are sparked almost daily by extremely hot and windy conditions and, most recently, dry lightning strikes created by the fires themselves.

Cooler conditions on Wednesday gave the country a moment to count the cost of the fires, although there were still more than 100 blazes in New South Wales (NSW) state alone and thousands of firefighters on the ground.

The body of a man was found in a burnt car early on Wednesday on the south coast of New South Wales after emergency workers began reaching the most damaged areas, according to the state's Rural Fire Service (RFS).

The death toll is likely to rise, NSW RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. “We still have grave concerns for (another person),” he told reporters in Sydney. There is “limited access to the remote area to try to identify and confirm one way or the other the status of that person.”

NSW police did not identify the missing man but said he was 72 years old and authorities have been unable to reach his home.

200 homes destroyed

Several fires continue to burn in the area, making assessments difficult, though local lawmaker Fiona Phillips said she estimates as many as 200 homes have been destroyed.

Large-scale livestock and animal casualties are also expected across Australia's east coast, though Mogo Zoo - home to Australias largest collection of primates, along with zebras, white rhinos, lions, tigers and giraffes was saved.

The wildlife park was threatened by an out-of-control bushfire, though zoo keepers and firefighters managed to save all 200 animals.

In Victoria state, four people remain missing, state Premier Daniel Andrews said, after a massive blaze ripped through Gippsland - a rural region about 500 km (310 miles) east of Melbourne. About 4,000 people in the town of Mallacoota in Victoria headed to the waterfront after the main road was cut off.

With thousands of people still stranded, Australia's military has been drafted in to provide supplies and assist with evacuations in areas, many of which have been left without power for hours. In Ulladulla, a small coastal town about 230 km south of Sydney, many residents and holidaymakers were scrambling to get supplies, leading to long lines outside the few shops open on a public holiday.

Black Hawk helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and naval vessels have all been deployed, along with military personnel.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said authorities were working to restore communications with areas cut off by the fires, and she warned conditions will deteriorate again over the weekend.

Australia's capital Sydney was blanketed in thick smoke, reaching about 20 times hazardous levels, prompting health warnings.

The smoke has also drifted to New Zealand where it has turned the daytime sky orange across the South Island.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xbxtel/article30448973.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1196797519,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/three-dead-several-missing-as-australia-counts-the-cost-of-devastating-bushfires/article30448976.ece
23,2020/01/01,Hope Kim Jong-un chooses 'peace and prosperity over conflict and war': Pompeo,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday he hoped North Korea would choose peace over war, a response to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un saying would introduce a “new strategic weapon” in the near future.

“So, seeing that reporting publicly, it remains the case that we hope that Chairman Kim will take a different course,” Mr. Pompeo told Fox News in an interview. “We're hopeful that ... Chairman Kim will make the right decision - he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war,” Pompeo said.

In a separate interview with CBS News, Mr. Pompeo was asked whether he was alarmed by Mr. Kim's statements — Mr. Kim said there were no grounds for North Korea to be bound any longer by a self-declared moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear bomb testing.

“If Chairman Kim has reneged on the commitments he made to President Trump, that is deeply disappointing,” Mr.Pompeo said.

25,2020/01/01,Heterosexual couples form 1st civil partnerships in England,"England and Wales have marked a new era in which heterosexual couples can choose to have a civil partnership instead of a marriage.

The change, mandated by Britain’s Supreme Court last year, took effect on Tuesday. The groundbreaking case had been brought by Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan, who were among the first to form a civil partnership under the new rules.

They were joined by their two children for the partnership formed at the Kensington and Chelsea Register Office in central London.

Ms. Steinfeld, 38, called it “a unique, special and personal moment for us” that had been “rooted in our desire to formalize our relationship in a more modern way, focus on equality and mutual respect.”

The new rules means that mixed-sex couples can opt for a civil partnership that will give them similar rights as married couples, including marriage allowance tax relief, inheritance tax exemption, and joint parental responsibility for children.

It is expected to be an attractive option for couples who believe marriage gives men the upper hand and also by couples who don’t want any religious element in their union.

The Supreme Court ruling means that civil partnerships, which have been available to same-sex couples since 2005, will be available to everyone.

Advocates of the change argued successfully in court that to deny heterosexual couples the same options available to same-sex couples amounted to discrimination. Ms. Steinfeld and Mr. Keidan lost their bid in a lower court, but triumphed at the Supreme Court.

""Against all odds, we succeeded in a legal battle against the government and then, they did what we asked for all along,” said Keidan, 43.

26,2020/01/01,North Korea leader promises look at new weapon soon,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has accused the Trump administration of dragging its feet in nuclear negotiations and warned that his country will soon show a new strategic weapon to the world as its bolsters its nuclear deterrent in face of “gangster-like” U.S. sanctions and pressure.

The North’s state media said Wednesday that Mr. Kim made the comments during a four-day ruling party conference held through Tuesday in the capital Pyongyang, where he declared that the North will never give up its security for economic benefits in the face of what he described as increasing U.S. hostility and nuclear threats.

Mr. Kim’s comments came after a months long stand-off between Washington and Pyongyang over disagreements involving disarmament steps and the removal of sanctions imposed on the North.

""He said that we will never allow the impudent U.S. to abuse the DPRK-U.S. dialogue for meeting its sordid aim but will shift to a shocking actual action to make it pay for the pains sustained by our people so far and for the development so far restrained,” the Korean Central News Agency said, referring to the North by its formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

Mr. Kim added that “if the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, there will never be the de-nuclearisation on the Korean Peninsula and the DPRK will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy,” according to the agency.

""In the past two years alone when the DPRK took preemptive and crucial measures of halting its nuclear test and ICBM test-fire and shutting down the nuclear-test ground for building confidence between the DPRK and the U.S., the U.S., far from responding to the former with appropriate measures, conducted tens of big and small joint military drills which its president personally promised to stop and threatened the former militarily through the shipment of ultra-modern warfare equipment into (South Korea),” the KCNA quoted Mr. Kim as saying.

Some experts say North Korea, which has always been sensitive about electoral changes in U.S. government, will avoid engaging in serious negotiations for a deal with Washington in coming months as it watches how Trump’s impending impeachment trial over his dealings with Ukraine affects U.S. presidential elections in November.

Mr. Kim and President Donald Trump have met three times since June 2018, but negotiations have faltered since the collapse of their second summit last February in Vietnam, where the Americans rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.

Mr. Kim’s speech followed months of intensified testing activity and belligerent statements issued by various North Korean officials, raising concerns that he was reverting to confrontation and preparing to do something provocative if Washington doesn’t back down and relieve sanctions.

The North announced in December that it performed two “crucial” tests at its long-range rocket launch site that would further strengthen its nuclear deterrent, prompting speculation that it was developing an ICBM or planning a satellite launch that would provide an opportunity to advance its missile technologies.

North Korea also last year ended a 17-month pause in ballistic activity by testing a slew of solid-fuel weapons that potentially expanded its capabilities to strike targets in South Korea and Japan, including U.S. military bases there. It also threatened to lift a self-imposed moratorium on the testing of nuclear bombs and ICBMs.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fxnwb1/article30448385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NORTHKOREA-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/north-korea-leader-promises-look-at-new-weapon-soon/article30448386.ece
27,2020/01/01,"Iran denies role in U.S. embassy violence, warns against retaliation","Iran denied it was behind violent protests at the U.S. embassy in Iraq on Tuesday and warned against any retaliation, after President Donald Trump blamed Tehran for an attack on the mission and said it would be held responsible.

“American officials have the astounding audacity of attributing to Iran the protests of the Iraqi people against (Washington's) savage killing of at least 25 Iraqis ...,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said in a statement carried on a ministry website.

Protesters led by Iranian-backed militias voiced their anger over U.S. air strikes on militia bases in Iraq and Syria, hurled stones and torched a security post at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

“Mousavi denied the American officials' charges against our country, cautioned against any ill-advised reaction or miscalculation by U.S. officials, and called on the White House to reconsider its destructive policies in the region,” the statement said.

Earlier on Tuesday, Trump said in a Twitter post: “Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible.”

28,2020/01/01,Man charged after “Picasso painting” attacked in London gallery,"British police have charged a man with criminal damage after a painting, reported by the BBC to have been by Spanish master Pablo Picasso, was attacked at a London gallery over the weekend.

The incident happened on Saturday at the Tate Modern gallery when Picasso's 1944 painting “Bust of a Woman”, worth some 20 million pounds ($26 million), was slashed the BBC said.

It said the work, which depicts Picasso's lover Dora Maar and was painted in Paris in May 1944 during the final months of the Nazi occupation, was reported to have been ripped.

The gallery confirmed an incident had taken place but declined to identify the painting.

It said in a statement: “An incident occurred at Tate Modern on Dec. 28 when a member of the public attempted to damage a painting.

“The person was swiftly apprehended and has been charged. Police are investigating. The work of art is with our conservation team for expert assessment.”

30,2020/01/01,Syria death toll for 2019 lowest in civil war: monitor,"Syria's nearly nine-year-old conflict which has cost more than 370,000 lives recorded its lowest annual death toll in 2019, a war monitor said Tuesday.

A total of 11,215 fighters and civilians were killed in the past year, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

Of those, 3,473 were civilians including 1,021 children, the Britain-based monitor said.

Fighting has raged on three major fronts in Syria during the past year.

In March, US-backed Kurdish forces expelled Islamic State (IS) jihadists from their last patch of territory in the country's far east near the Iraqi border.

Over the summer and in recent weeks, regime forces upped their military campaign against the jihadist-run region of Idlib in the northwest of the country.

The violence over the summer alone killed around 1,000 civilians in the region of some three million people where rebels are also present.

And to the east, Turkey and its Syrian proxies in October launched a cross-border incursion into Syrian territory to expel Kurdish fighters they view as “terrorists”.

The Observatory relies on a vast network of sources across Syria to document the war that broke out after the brutal repression of nationwide anti-regime protests in 2011.

The Damascus regime has since 2015 regained large swathes of the country from rebels and jihadists with Russian military backing.

The death toll for 2017 stood at more than 33,000, but dropped to just above 19,600 people the following year.

The bloodiest year of the conflict was in 2014, when around 76,000 people lost their lives.

That year saw the rise of IS across large swathes of the country and in neighbouring Iraq.

Since early 2011, an average of more than 40,000 people a year have been killed and millions have been displaced from their homes in the war.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/u4cued/article30448105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORRECTION-IRAQ-US-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/syria-death-toll-for-2019-lowest-in-civil-war-monitor/article30448106.ece
31,2020/01/01,"U.S. has no plan to evacuate embassy in Baghdad, more forces being sent to compound","The United States has no plans to evacuate its embassy in Baghdad and additional forces are being sent following violent demonstrations outside the compound by protesters and militia fighters enraged by American air strikes, U.S officials said on Tuesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump blamed Iran for “orchestrating” the attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and said he would hold Tehran responsible.

“U.S. personnel are secure and there has been no breach. There are no plans to evacuate Embassy Baghdad,” a State Department spokesperson said.

The spokesperson added that the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Matt Tueller had been on previously scheduled personal travel and was returning to the embassy.

Earlier on Tuesday, Iraqi officials said the ambassador and other staff were evacuated from the embassy for their safety.

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said additional forces were being sent to the embassy.

Mr. Esper called on the Iraqi government to help in protecting U.S. personnel in the country as it was part of Baghdad's ”international responsibilities.”

U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that a small number of additional Marines were expected to go to the embassy in Baghdad.

One official said they were expected to number in the dozens and would be there temporarily.

Another official said two Apache helicopters carried out a ”show of force” over the embassy.

The U.S. military carried out the strikes on Sunday against the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group in response to the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base.

“Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter.

“To those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don't want to be dominated and controlled by Iran, this is your time!” Mr. Trump wrote in another Twitter post.

32,2020/01/01,Warren warns ‘democracy hangs in the balance’ in New Year’s Eve speech,"Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren sought to re-energize her White House campaign in a New Year’s Eve speech on Tuesday, warning that “democracy hangs in the balance” five weeks before nominating contests begin in early February.

In her home state of Massachusetts on the first anniversary of her campaign launch, Ms. Warren said President Donald Trump would ”try to cheat his way through yet another election” if he is not removed from office after his impeachment by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives.

“In the past 12 months, the president has become bolder with his lies and more brazen in his law-breaking,” said Ms. Warren, who as a U.S. senator will vote on whether to convict Trump of improperly pressuring Ukraine for political favours. “Meanwhile, the Republicans in Congress have turned into fawning, spineless defenders of his crimes.”

The race for the Democratic nomination remains fluid as the calendar turns to 2020, with 15 Democrats still in the running and a majority of voters telling pollsters that they have yet to settle on a final choice. The nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire in early February will be critical tests of candidates’ viability.

Ms. Warren’s address took place in front of a crowd of nearly 700 people at a church in downtown Boston known as a gathering place for revolutionary colonists in the 1770s.

“We are a nation that fights back,” she said. “Fighting back is an act of patriotism.”

Ms. Warren remains a top Democratic candidate in national opinion polls but her standing slipped in autumn after a months-long surge that briefly vaulted her to front-runner status.

She is in third place behind Joe Biden, the former vice president, and fellow U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, according to the website RealClearPolitics’s national polling average.

Ms. Warren’s momentum stalled under sustained attacks from more moderate Democratic candidates like Pete Buttigieg, the outgoing mayor of South Bend, Indiana, over her support for Medicare for All, the healthcare overhaul that would eliminate private insurance in favour of a single government-run plan.

In response, Ms. Warren has revised her rhetoric on healthcare, emphasizing her intention to phase in Medicare for All over several years to preserve “choice” for Americans.

She has also sought to return to the theme of economic populism that animated the early part of her campaign.

Ms. Warren, who has sworn off high-dollar fundraisers, argued on Tuesday that other candidates who “kiss the rings” of the wealthy are beholden to rich donors and corporate interests.

“The billionaires, the corporate executives and their favorite presidential candidates have one clear goal: to convince you that everything you imagine is impossible,” Ms. Warren said.

While she did not name any rivals, her remarks were likely aimed at Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, whom she has previously criticized for holding high-priced fundraisers.

In recent months, Ms. Warren has seen a slowdown in her fundraising pace. The campaign said last week it had raised just over $17 million in the fourth quarter with a few days to go, lower than the $24.6 million she raised last quarter.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iccvvv/article30447872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020ELIZABETHWARREN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/warren-warns-democracy-hangs-in-the-balance-in-new-years-eve-speech/article30447873.ece
33,2020/01/01,U.S.-China ‘Phase One’ trade deal to be signed in January,"A partial new U.S.-China trade agreement will be signed in the middle of next month, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, announcing that he will also then travel to China for continued talks.

Mr. Trump’s tweet, sent moments before Wall Street opened for the year’s final trading day, set a calendar date for an event that had hung in uncertainty in recent weeks as details remained scant.

Washington and Beijing earlier this month announced a “Phase One” trade deal, de-escalating their nearly two-year trade war as Mr. Trump reduced or cancelled some tariffs while Beijing promised to adopt trade reforms and buy more U.S. farm exports.

The text has yet to be made public pending what U.S. officials say is a largely technical review.

“I will be signing our very large and comprehensive Phase One Trade Deal with China on January 15,” Mr. Trump tweeted.

“The ceremony will take place at the White House. High level representatives of China will be present.”

U.S. and Chinese officials have said the agreement includes protections for intellectual property, food and farm goods, financial services and foreign exchange, and a provision for dispute resolution.

Under the new deal, China has committed to a minimum of $200 billion in increased purchases over the next two years from U.S. manufacturers, farmers, energy producers and service providers, according to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.

On to Phase Two?

Mr. Trump said on Tuesday he will travel to Beijing to continue negotiations “at a later date” — showing willingness to pursue talks that have acrimoniously broken down more than once and left both sides to salvage a partial deal.

While the détente put a stop to further deterioration in the trade war, it leaves many of the barriers erected so far in place.

Mr. Trump cancelled plans to impose tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese merchandise in mid-December — including hot consumer items like mobile phones — but punishing U.S. tariffs remain for about $250 billion in Chinese-made goods, including machinery and many electronic items.

Word of the truce has driven a Wall Street rally this month, but U.S. stocks were headed sideways on Tuesday afternoon.

The two economic powers have been locked in a bruising trade war since the first half of 2018 that has roiled the global economy and helped send the manufacturing sector into decline.

Observers say that in that time, the trade war may have ushered in a long-term de-coupling of trade relations between the world’s two largest economies.

Americans have cut merchandise purchases from China substantially so far this year, while their appetite for Mexican goods has grown.

The yawning U.S. goods deficit with China fell 14.7% in the 10 months through October of 2019 but rose 29% with Mexico, according to official U.S. figures.

What the two sides can accomplish in a potentially thornier “phase two” of negotiations — which could touch on Beijing’s sweeping market interventions and industrial subsidies — remains unclear.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the trade war’s burden fell squarely on China, while sparing the American economy. Economists say both sides have suffered.

But the United States appears to have emerged from an earlier recession scare as Beijing has moved to reverse a worrisome slowdown.

Still, some economists and trade experts say Phase One was largely a victory for Beijing.

Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which has largely favoured Mr. Trump’s aggressive trade posture with China, said earlier that agreeing to remove tariffs amounted to “giving away much of our leverage, while kicking the can down the road on the most meaningful trade issues with China.”

The truce also offers Chinese President Xi Jinping breathing space as he faces a slowing economy and political trouble in Hong Kong.

Peter Navarro, White House director of trade and manufacturing policy, told CNBC on Tuesday that the Phase One agreement was only one plank in the Trump trade agenda, which encompasses other newly negotiated agreements in North America and Asia.

“Next year... we’re going to try to get something going with Great Britain, Vietnam, Europe and anybody else who wants to fairly trade with the United States,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8wfdzz/article30447837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-CHINA-TRADE-ECONOMY-DIPLOMACY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-china-phase-one-trade-deal-to-be-signed-january/article30447838.ece
34,2020/01/01,Thousands swarm to Australian beaches to escape bushfires,"Thousands swarmed to beaches on Australia's east coast on Tuesday to escape fierce wildfires bearing down on several seaside towns, as the government readied naval vessels and military helicopters to aid firefighting and evacuations.

Government officials called for Australian military support and assistance from U.S. and Canadian fire crews as authorities confirmed two people had died overnight, taking to 11 the total deaths in wildfires since the beginning of October.

The huge bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres), with new blazes sparked into life almost daily by extremely hot and windy conditions in bushland left tinder dry after a three-year drought.

Fuelled by searing temperatures and high winds, more than 200 fires are now burning across the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, threatening several towns and snapping their power, mobile and internet links.

“This is absolutely one of the worst fire seasons we've seen,” Shane Fitzsimmons, commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, told a briefing in Sydney.

“It's going to be a very long, difficult dangerous night still ahead. It's going to be another difficult day again tomorrow.”

Authorities said the main firefront was moving up the coast and warned those in its path to seek shelter close to the beach.

About 4,000 people in the town of Mallacoota in Victoria headed to the waterfront after the main road was cut off. Those who could not make it there scrambled for shelter in a gymnasium and other public buildings, as emergency sirens wailed.

Some of those trapped in the town posted images of blood-red, smoke-filled skies on social media. One beachfront photograph showed people lying shoulder-to-shoulder on the sand, some wearing gas masks.

It looked “a lot like Armageddon,” said David Jeffrey, the owner of the Wave Oasis guesthouse, adding, “It's terrifying.”

Fisherman Steve Casement said he had lost his house in Mallacoota to the fires.

“We are stuck here now,” he said. ”Everyone is pretty shocked at the moment, most of my mates are in the same position.

“Right now, I am on a trailer watching the town burn down, listening to gas bottles explode at some poor bugger's home and seeing smoke all around me.”

Authorities said that by late afternoon the worst danger had passed.

Darkness in the afternoon

Several hundreds of kilometres north, the Jervis Bay tourist spot famed for having the whitest sand beach in the world, was shrouded in darkness in the afternoon as massive fires burned, with conditions expected to worsen.

Australia's plight surfaced in the U.S. presidential campaign on Tuesday as Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders invoked the fires to highlight that Americans are ready to address climate change. “You have a nation on fire,” Sanders said at an Iowa news conference.

The United States, which had already sent 72 fire personnel to Australia, will dispatch another 21 this weekend and expects additional requests in days to come, the U.S. Forest Service said. Australia and New Zealand had sent 138 fire personnel to the U.S West during August 2018 fires.

Canada has so far sent 66 firefighters, the first time since signing a reciprocal agreement with Australia in 2015, and was working to find additional resources, said Kim Connors, Executive Director of the Forest Fire Centre.

The blazes were also generating their own weather patterns, with erratic winds, dry lightning and a significantly faster spread in different direction, fire authorities said.

Ellie Morello took refuge at a beachside motel with her mother, some neighbours, friends at pets as fires approached Batemans Bay, a town on the New South Wales coast.

“My throat's hurting from the smoke,” she said. “Burnt leaves and sparks were falling on me like rain.”

Another small fire was closing in behind her as she spoke, she added.

Morello and others said they had run out of food and were unable to replenish supplies as shops had shut.

James Findlay, a Melbourne-based broadcaster, said his parents' home in the town was gutted after palm trees on the lawn caught fire. The couple were vacationing in New Zealand.

“There were a lot of family heirlooms in there,” he said. “A lot of priceless memories.”

The fires have been spread across four states, with fronts stretching hundreds of kilometres in some cases, affecting many towns and rural areas.

The two people who died overnight were believed to have been a father and son protecting their property near the town of Cobargo in New South Wales, police said, with a third missing, feared dead, while in Victoria, four more were unaccounted for.

Bushfires burned on the outskirts of Sydney, cloaking the harbour city in smoke ahead of a New Year's Eve fireworks display.

Authorities allowed the display to go ahead, despite some public calls for cancellation in solidarity with fire-hit areas in the state.

“Many of us have mixed feelings about this evening, but the important thing we take out of this is that we're a resilient state,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/840kuf/article30447607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIABUSHFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thousands-swarm-to-australian-beaches-to-escape-bushfires/article30447608.ece
35,2020/01/01,French President says he wants solid ties with post-Brexit Britain,"French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday that he wanted a strong relationship with post-Brexit Britain and also pledged to push through an overhaul of the pension system, after weeks of nationwide strikes by trade unions.

Speaking in his traditional televised New Year's eve address to the nation, Mr. Macron said: “The United Kingdom's departure from the European Union is a test for our country. I will strive to maintain a solid relationship between our two countries.”

Pension reforms

Mr. Macron said he expected his government to quickly find a compromise with unions on the reform, but without departing from the principles laid out by ministers.

Unions are trying to force the former investment banker to abandon his overhaul of France’s pension system with nationwide strikes since Dec. 5 that have crippled public transport.

“The retirement reform that I’ve committed myself to before you will be carried through because it is a project of social justice and progress,” he said in the prime-time televised address to the nation.

Mr. Macron wants to replace France’s current system of 42 different sector-specific pension schemes with a points-based system for all, which his government says would be fairer and more transparent.

While Mr. Macron’s government has rejected union calls to drop the reform altogether, it has offered concessions to a growing list of sectors as it seeks to defuse tensions.

“We will take into account difficult tasks so that those who do them can leave earlier,” he said.

Mr. Macron has so far refused to back down on plans to encourage people to work until they are 64 instead of the legal retirement age of 62, a key union demand.

Under his plans, workers would receive reduced pension rights if they retire before 64, unless they benefit from special exemptions due to their profession, like police officers or soldiers.

Far left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said on Twitter that Mr. Macron’s words were “a declaration of war on those who reject the reform”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cm838w/article30447394.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRANCE-POLITICS-NEW-YEAR-MACRON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/french-president-says-he-wants-solid-ties-with-post-brexit-britain/article30447395.ece
36,2020/01/01,How 'On The Streets of Chennai' rounded off 2019 with impromptu performance,"The space behind PH Café in Egmore is packed. A group of youngsters is performing popular Tamil film songs. Srilatha NS and Madhuvanthy G jump on to the stage, grab the mics and start singing ‘Maruvarthai Pesathe’, much to the delight of the audience. Srilatha, part of an acapella band herself, starts beatboxing. The crowd claps and sings along. As the world awaits the dawn of a brand new year, this exuberant group is looking back and celebrating hit songs of the decade.

The final performance of 2019 for On The Streets of Chennai, a household name in the city, was an unplanned, spontaneous one that only took place because some patrons decided to celebrate the new year here. The night nevertheless turned out to be a memorable one.

The group has been busking at different parts of the city for the past one year, collaborating with different bands. The host of the show, Harini Keechi, is in fact an ardent fan of the group. She was shopping with her mother at Pondy Bazaar one day when she happened to meet them. She loved their performance and discussed with them the possibility of hosting a show on New Year’s Eve. And that’s how it all came about. Songs performed for the New Year special were from the list that Harini curated.

Senthil Raj, the founder of On The Streets of Chennai, is a happy man. He says, “We started the year with a gig and we are also ending it with one.” Their début performance was at Elliot’s beach in January 2019 and the year was an eventful one for them. Raj recalls the cordial welcome accorded to the team by the city police commissioner at Central Railway station for their Awe50me Weekend performance. He also mentions the generous support shown by Metro Rail officials. Starting off as a small team with five to six members, they are now ninety members-strong.

The team fondly remembers one of their gigs at Thiruvanmiyur beach. The crowd remained seated even after the show was over: they “wanted more”. Once, after a flute performance at Pondy Bazaar, a lady from the audience came forward and hugged the flautist. The performance moved her to tears.

Raj feels that people in Chennai are welcoming of busking. “We will be happy to have some healthy competition,” he points out. They look forward to making busking an integral part of the city. On their wish-list for 2020 is a jamming session with bigger bands like Agam and seeking their guidance for the road ahead. But these are all means to achieve their ultimate goal: spreading smiles.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/4izvse/article30451028.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02mpStreets1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/taking-music-to-the-streets/article30451029.ece

The A3-size calendar gives day and dates for 40 years from 1981 to 2020. Devised by D Kumaresh, 55, a superintendent with Goods and Services Tax Department in Bengaluru, the calendar also has interesting travel information and maths puzzles.

Kumaresh has created the calendar out of passion. The whole year of 2020 (MMXX) is displayed in a 12 x 3 inch space. Speaking of his reasons for creating the calendar, Kumaresh says, “It is more valuable than popcorn or peanut at a movie or during travel. There are fun facts on all the four sides of the calendar. You can find out stuff about dates or find out 20 spots in the country that are more than 2020 kilometers from Bengaluru. There are 20 fun facts related to the number 20 and just in case you want to know the 20 popular petes of Bengaluru from Akkipete (rice) to upparapete (salt), browse the list of the traders in the city.”

Kumaresh has done special calendars over the years. “I did a calendar on Sachin Tendulkar in 2014 as he announced his retirement in 2013 November. The calendar listed his achievements and he was kind enough to reply and thank me for the effort. When I sent greetings to the former Prime Minister, HD Devegowda, in 2001, he congratulated me from Safdarjung, New Delhi.”

Apart from calendars, Kumaresh had devised a book, a ready reckoner for GST returns, Margadarshi. “When GST came into effect in 2017, the jurisdiction of Bengaluru was created based on pin code and had nearly 275 offices. To make it easy to locate this offices, I collated the details of entire Karnataka for tax payers, officers and staff to identify their jurisdictional tax office.”

Born and brought up near Shivajinagar, Kumaresh, did Civil Engineering in UVCE in 1988. “Travelling, photography, music and quizzing were always my interests. I always enjoyed receiving and sending greeting cards. I thought why not do them myself? Gradually from greeting cards, I moved to calendars and I created calendars with extra information. With encouragement, I started to work on them every year, the 2020 calendar is my 28th effort. I print 1,000 calendars and distribute them to interested people.”

38,2020/01/01,Video streaming on TV screens rising in India,"While Internet bandwidth at dirt-cheap prices triggered a boom in streaming of video on mobile phones, it is now transitioning to TV screens.

With over 30 streaming video apps competing to catch one’s eyes, there is a plethora of opportunities to view the best content on a wider screens, said analysts.

Streaming video is getting popular because of on-demand and break-free viewing.Creative original content provided by the OTT (over-the-top) players is also helping, they said.

Watching video on mobile is ideal for short-form content of 30 minutes of viewing on-the-go. But watching video on mobile is not that great for long-form content which is between 1 to 3 hours.

“For streaming video, mobile is the gateway but TV is the destination. Consumers are getting introduced to streaming video on mobile. Then, they are figuring out how to watch this on their TV screens,” said Nishith Shah, an industry insider.

“Streaming video apps are reporting better numbers on TV compared with mobiles because of longer watch times. This has resulted in more spend per user,” he said.

Since more hours of viewing is happening on the big screens, it has helped in rising smart TV sales.

Pratyush Chinmoy, head of marketing, Mirc Electronics. which operates under Onida brand, said, “Television has emerged as the centre of viewing experience for popular OTT platforms. These OTT platforms can be best experienced on the big screen that only television can provide. With TV, one can enjoy content along with family and friends which then scores over mobile due to continuous interference of other apps or calls over mobile phone which can hamper the viewing experience.

“The smart TV segment itself is witnessing a big revolution now, following the high-growth period that smartphones enjoyed in the last few years. The biggest winners have been the consumers and the OTT publishers with higher investment in the OTT content space,” he said.

Akhil Suhag, founder and CEO, FanFight, an online gaming platform for cricket, said, “Increasing trend of OTT platforms moving from mobile to television gives access to wider number of consumers for players like us. We have been associated with Hotstar and MX Player for reaching out to consumers, who are very excited to play fantasy cricket on our platform. With this engagement, we were able to scale up our subscriptions to six million players and [are] now aiming for 10 million.”

“OTT platforms have become very popular, as it gives better viewing experience as the screen size is bigger and people can spend quality time watching movies and exclusive shows with their family and friends. These platforms have been helping us reach out to right audience,” he said.

Today, every brand is now pushing smart TVs loaded with apps. Also, leading cable and DTH operators are introducing Android-powered smart set-top-boxes, a single device which is capable of handling both regular scheduled TV broadcasting as well as streaming video.

The market size for streaming video is estimated to be about $1 billion and growing at 40-45% a year, making India one of the fastest-growing OTT markets in the world.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/video-streaming-on-tv-screens-rising-in-india/article30453668.ece

40,2020/01/01,FII India embarks on second phase of growth,"Having created awareness about Canadian Wood over the last five years, Forest Innovation Investments India Pvt. Ltd. (FII India), the British Columbia government’s market development agency for forest products in India, has embarked on its second phase of growth in the country.

“In the first five years we focused on the manufacturing industry which was making doors, windows and furniture. We are now looking for the next five years very enthusiastically. We have brought about certain tweaking in our strategy,” said Pranesh Chhibber, country director, FII India, in an interview.

“Initially, we focused 100% on the wood manufacturing industry but because we were able to create enough buzz and demand for Canadian Wood, we are now helping in building the capability in India to build with wood. So, we are not only just helping source wood from Canada but we are also bringing in the expertise and sharing it with the people here on how to build with wood,” he added.

He said HNIs, who wanted their farm houses to be built in wood and the hospitality industry, which was looking into resorts, have shown interest to now build in wood as there was no expertise available earlier.

“We are now in the process of building a few demo houses, the structures which will be available to the people in the industry to show the developers, hospitality industry and HNIs as to how it looks and what can be done with wood,” he said.

He said some houses are being built and will be completed by the end of this fiscal. By then, half a dozen houses in different forms and styles will be ready in South, West and North for people to see.

He said the import of lumber and softwood was growing.

“[In the] next five years, we would like to see much larger presence in India of Canadian Wood species. Other exporting countries are helping to grow the market,” he said.

The annual wood import to India is estimated around seven million cubic meters (cbm) by volume and around $2 billion in value terms. Five years ago, the share of softwood import was 33% of total wood imports to India.

Today, it has increased to 45%. Lumber imports has started growing. Over last five years, share of lumber import has increased from 9% to 22% of total wood imports to India.

“It is observed that share of softwood lumber import into India from around the world is growing. Over the last five years, it has grown from 4% to 14. We expect this share to increase up to 25% for the next three years,” Mr Chhibber said.

He said Canada’s share of total softwood lumber imports to India has been around 5%.

Today, most of India’s forests are protected and since enough local wood is not available, imported lumber is meeting the demand.

Most wood imports into India come from New Zealand (27%), Malaysia (17%), South America (16%), Europe (14%) & Africa(12%) Also North America (6%) is gradually increasing its share as a major supplier to India.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fii-india-embarks-on-second-phase-of-growth/article30453655.ece
41,2020/01/01,HCG chief bats for universal healthcare scheme in India,"With the number of cancer patients in India likely to double in a few years, B.S. Ajai Kumar, oncologist-turned-entrepreneur and chairman and CEO of Healthcare Global Enterprises Ltd. (HCG), one of India’s largest cancer care providers, has batted for introduction of universal healthcare model in India to save lives.

Stating that going forward, China and India will have the highest incidence of cancer, he said all patients should be treated properly.

“In India, the problem is that we don’t have provision for universal healthcare. We have certain healthcare schemes for poor people. So, today, over 50% of the patients are paying from their own pocket. So, naturally, it becomes very expensive,” he said.

“In U.S., if you get cancer treatment done, it would cost between $30,000 to $40,000. Here, we are doing it for less than $8,000. The problem is that even if people are paying ₹5 lakh, they are paying from their pocket. But if you go to Singapore or the West Aisa, the ₹5 lakh here is going to be ₹50 lakh. So, it is very cheap here but people cannot afford [even] that. That is why we have recommended universal healthcare,” he added.

Dr. Kumar said the government has to create a universal healthcare model for the entire country.

“My frustration is that we have not done that yet. Unless we do that the existing schemes will not help. People are dying because they do not get the right kind of treatment,” he said.

“We have to bring that quality. Like I am a Medicare recipient and have a Medicare card in the U.S. When I was young, I contributed for this and India has so many youth. Why can’t they contribute? Their contribution can go for universal healthcare pool,” he further said.

“So, billions of dollars will be there and people can benefit from that. There will be uniformity in care. When you become old, you can benefit. That model has to be created. I don’t know what is coming in the way of that model,” he added.

On his company’s growth plans, he said there were opportunities to grow in India, West Asia and Africa.

“But right now, we want to consolidate. Because we have grown too much, we want to consolidate and then get into the growth phase again. We would like to go the asset-light model. We are also coming with models wherein we will not own the equipment,” he said.

He said his priority would be to reduce the company’s debt of ₹650 crore debt by improving EBITDA and profitability.

In the next five years, the company wants all his existing 24 centres and the new ones in the pipeline to achieve full capacity utilisation. Besides, the company is looking at operating and managing models and also areas where in it can provide its expertise to cure cancer.

“The entire Africa is a huge opportunity to provide our people and give them good quality treatment. We are looking at the partnership model like we have in Nashik. We want to grow through partnerships. Since I grew rapidly, I want to consolidate first,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/hcg-chief-bats-for-universal-healthcare-scheme-in-india/article30453624.ece

43,2020/01/01,Reforms to spur recovery in 2020: India Inc.,"After a forgettable 2019, India Inc. is expecting a rebound in economic growth in 2020 due to the reforms announced by the Centre.

“We are bullish about the prospects for not just Vedanta but also for the Indian economy in 2020,” said Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal.

“A lot of work, in terms of structural reforms that has happened in 2019, will start to bear fruit as we move ahead in the new year when we see India’s GDP growth picking up pace,” he added.

Last year, the government had announced a host of reforms, including reduction of corporate tax significantly from the more-than 30% to an effective rate of 25.17% and, for new manufacturing units, 17.16%.

“2020 will be one of economic rebound; the expectation is that the economy will regain its dynamic growth trajectory once again and take its position to [reaching] $5 trillion by 2025. Inflation conditions in 2020 will remain benign except for a few fluctuations because of weather disruptions, said D.K. Aggarwal, president, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry. At this juncture, he added, the focus of the government must be to refuel consumption demand with a significant reduction in personal income tax.

The government on Tuesday announced a detailed road map for ₹102 lakh crore worth of infrastructure investment over FY20-25, which is likely to spur economic activity and revive growth.

“It is a welcome move from the point of view of the infrastructure sector and reinforces the government’s commitment towards making India a leading world economy,” said Anshuman Magazine, chairman & CEO, India, South East Asia, Middle East & Africa, CBRE.

According to industry body CII, a gradual recovery is expected in 2020 as there are nascent signs that the economy is on a better footing than the year gone by.

With proactive measures taken by the government and the Reserve Bank of India, the industry believes that gradual recovery will soon take place.

Signs of recovery

“Nascent signs of recovery are noted in the form of improved PMIs of manufacturing and services, a jump in passenger air traffic and sharp moderation in the decline in sales of passenger cars, among others,” said Vikram Kirloskar, president, CII.

“Though we may continue to see a subdued GDP print in the third quarter, the quarters thereafter are likely to see a rebound,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/qmpj3c/article30453600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02BUVIKRAMKIRLOSKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/reforms-to-spur-recovery-in-2020-india-inc/article30453601.ece

45,2020/01/01,Pumpset makers edgy over energy norms,"Pumpset manufacturers will have to meet a revised set of guidelines starting January 1 to get energy efficiency star rating for their products but there is a delay in getting the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) approval for the applications submitted, according to manufacturers here.

The manufacturers, including those making star-rated pumpsets, will have to get the entire range of products tested at an independent laboratory, get the results approved by the Bureau of Indian Standards and apply to the BEE for star-rating approval. The BEE had announced the new standards a couple of months ago. Even in pumpset-making hubs such as Coimbatore, Ahmedabad, and Rajkot, most manufacturers are yet to get BEE approvals, they said.

“Pumpsets will have to have the new star rating for energy efficiency. But we are yet to get required approvals. If a manufacturer had made 5-star rated energy efficiency pumpsets earlier, the same product will come to a lower category such as 3-star, now,” said V. Krishnakumar, president, Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association.

Apart from the delay in getting the approvals, a matter of concern to manufacturers is that government departments even now ask for five star-rated pumpsets in the tenders. “There is a 20% increase in standards for five-star rating. It will take some time for manufacturers to meet these standards. The BEE should inform the departments in central and State governments to ask for star rated pumpsets till then and not insist on a five-star rating,” said a leading pumpset producer.

“Though the BEE had assured us that it would communicate to all the government departments on the revised standards and not to insist on five-star rating, it has not done so yet. This will deprive the industry of the opportunity to take part in government tenders, at least in the short-term,” Mr. Krishnakumar added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/icrsec/article30453582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02BUPUMPSET,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pumpset-makers-edgy-over-energy-norms/article30453583.ece
46,2020/01/01,"IRDAI fines Maruti, Hero broking firms","The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has imposed a penalty of ₹3 crore on Maruti Insurance Broking (MIBL) and ₹2.18 crore on Hero Insurance Broking India (HIBIL) for not complying with the Motor Insurance Service Provider (MISP) guidelines.

In separate orders, the Authority directed the entities to make certain changes for compliance and improved governance.

Taking serious note of the affidavit filed by the respective Principal Officers of MIBL and HIBIL, the regulator said the affidavits were contrary to the facts. Hence, it directed the entities to not pay performance incentives to the respective Principal Officer for one year, from the date of order.

The action against MIBL and HIBIL followed the regulator deciding to call for information, from select insurance intermediaries mainly involved in selling and servicing motor insurance policies through the motor dealers. Providing the backdrop was the completion of one year since the MISP guidelines were issued.

Conflict of interest

IRDAI had also received complaints from some general insurance agents who sought to highlight the apparent conflict of interest in the role of MISPs in selling insurance policies and servicing and repairing motor vehicles. The “high claims ratio under the MISP channel, extra payments made to MISP by insurers, disparity of treatment to agents,” were cited.

The Authority also got complaints from insurance firms about insurance intermediaries have created a panel of insurers in violation of MISP guidelines.

Though separate orders, passed in the third week of December but made public recently, there were several common points, including a direction to both MIBL and HIBIL to “dismantle panel of insurers and empanel all insurers on platform, have full integration with insurers’ computer systems, ensure premiums quoted to customers come directly from insurer's systems without any intervention by the broker.”

IRDAI directed the two entities to redesign the current system of seeking customer consent for purchasing motor insurance in such a manner that the customer exercises choice of selecting the insurer through an OTP-based system at the time of issuance of a new motor insurance policy and its renewal.The regulator also wanted the entities to submit a quarterly audit report that the electronic platform/ portal complied with requirements of the MISP guidelines and in no way interferes or places restrictions in the premium to be charged by insurers or in any way restricts / influences the choice of the customer.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/6ldunc/article30453574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02thBUGAVEL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/irdai-fines-maruti-hero-broking-firms/article30453575.ece

49,2020/01/01,PM Modi calls up South Asian leaders,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up leaders of Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka on Wednesday and conveyed India’s commitment to the principle of “neighbourhood first”.

During the talks, Mr. Modi conveyed his greetings to the leaders and discussed the upcoming regional interactions. The talks hint at India’s pursuit of a regional arrangement without the participation of Pakistan.

“He emphasised India’s commitment to the ‘neighbourhood first’ policy and the vision of shared peace, security, prosperity and progress for all of India’s friends and partners in the region,” an official press release said.

India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ policy was adopted soon after Mr. Modi took charge in May 2014 which led to several key regional agreements including the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh.

Mr. Modi told his Bangladesh counterpart Sheikh Hasina that India’s ties with Dhaka were a “priority” for his government. In recent weeks, relations with the eastern neighbour were marred by negative references to the country by several leaders including Home Minister Amit Shah who justified the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 citing alleged persecution against minority religious communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Both leaders discussed the upcoming celebrations in Dhaka around the birth centenary of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in March where the Indian leader is expected to be a leading speaker. Mr. Modi also spoke to Nepal PM K.P. Sharma Oli. During 2019m both sides completed several bilateral projects including operationalisation of the Motihari Amlekhgunj petroleum pipeline. Both leaders agreed to inaugurate an integrated checkpost of Biratnagar through video conference.

In his talk with Bhutan’s king Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuk, Mr. Modi discussed the visit of the ruler to India in 2020. Mr. Modi visited Bhutan soon after being sworn in for the second stint.

“We began the last decade with a lot of hope. In 2009-2010, India was growing at 8%. Today, we are barely growing at around 4%. Post the nuclear deal, the international community and the press recognised India’s global strength. Today, for various reasons, the legitimacy of our democracy stands in question,” said Mr. Patel, one of the key political aides of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, in a statement put out on Twitter.

“Let’s hope the new decade is not another lost decade,” he added.

The comments from one of the key strategists comes at a time when the principal Opposition party is looking to work on a revival plan to reach out to crucial support bases like the youth.

CAA protests

The ongoing protests by students across various campuses over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed nation-wide National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the police action on campuses like Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) have allowed the party to connect with the youth.

Party insiders claim that the Congress leadership didn’t want the CAA-NRC protest to become another BJP versus Congress battle.

“Initially, we were clearly told that these organic protests should get primacy,” said a Congress spokesperson on why the Congress leaders or Chief Ministers were not seen leading the protests like West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee, who immediately hit the streets.

Changes tack

Post Jharkhand Assembly poll results — the first Assembly election after the passage of the CAA in Parliament — where the Opposition trumped the ruling BJP, the Congress seems to have changed tack.

While former party chief Rahul Gandhi visited Assam to meet with the families of protesters who were killed in police firing, his sister and party general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra went to Lucknow to take on the Yogi Adityanath government for the alleged “excesses committed by the Uttar Pradesh police under his watch.”

While elections in these States are some time away — Assam goes to polls in 2021 and Uttar Pradesh a year later — the attempt is clearly to work on a long term revival plan.

Even Congress Chief Ministers took the cue as both Kamal Nath in Madhya Pradesh and Ashok Gehlot in Rajasthan led massive protest marches against the CAA in their States.

In the short run, the Congress is looking to revive its fortunes in Delhi where currently it doesn’t have a single MLA and later in Bihar where the party continues to be in alliance with the Rashtriya Janata Dal.

The party would also try to paper over differences between Team Rahul and Team Sonia as it was evident on the last day of 2019. Party veteran Janardan Dwivedi, who was dropped from the Congress Working Committee, made a quiet comeback as part of the Delhi Congress’ campaign committee that was announced on Tuesday.

It is clear that even as the Congress gets ready to re-annoint Mr. Rahul Gandhi as the party chief, seniors and veterans will have a role to play.

“2019 will be remembered for the resilience of our students & common citizens who challenged an arrogant and a powerful government for its unconstitutional moves,” Mr. Patel had tweeted and added, “2020 will see a resurgence and coming together of pro-Constitution and pro-India forces and defeat this government’s anti-Indian policies.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u8sqo4/article30453634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THRDAHMEDPATEL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/legitimacy-of-indias-democracy-in-question/article30453635.ece
52,2020/01/01,8 new buildings likely under new Central Vista,"Eight new government office buildings, a new Parliament House and a residential complex near the South Block that could house the homes of the Prime Minister and the Vice-President are among the projects under consideration for the Centre’s redevelopment of the Central Vista, a Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry source said.

The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) is likely to issue tenders for individual projects for the revamp of the 3-km-long Rajpath from Rashtrapati Bhavan till the India Gate, construction of a new Parliament building and a common Central Secretariat for Ministries by February, the source said.

Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Hardeep Puri had in October 2019 announced the government’s ambitious plan and named the appointment of Gujarat-based architecture firm, HCP Design, as the consultant for the project.

The new development would be below the height of the India Gate, the source said, adding that the office buildings were likely to be seven floors each and accommodate many more government staff than the existing bhavans, most of which are set to be demolished. While Shastri Bhavan, Krishi Bhavan, Nirman Bhavan and Vigyan Bhavan would be demolished, “a political call” would have to be taken for newer buildings like the External Affairs Ministry’s Jawahar Bhavan, the source said.

The new building, for which the process of land-use change of a 9.5-acre plot was started on December 21, 2019, would be triangular or “wave-shaped”, the source said. According to the December 21 notification, the Master Plan-2021 of Delhi would be amended to change the plot opposite the existing Parliament House from ‘recreational’ use to “Parliament House”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ryj4y/article30453519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01PARLIAMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8-new-buildings-likely-under-centres-redevelopment-of-central-vista/article30453520.ece
53,2020/01/01,"No automatic conviction for abetment of suicide, says SC","A person accused of dowry harassment cannot be automatically convicted for abetment of suicide, the Supreme Court has held in a judgment.

A Bench of Justices Navin Sinha and B.R. Gavai held that “even if it is established that the woman concerned had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of marriage and that her husband has subjected her to cruelty, the court is not bound to presume that suicide has been abetted by her husband.”

The court is required to take into consideration all other circumstances of the case.

“We are of the view that merely because an accused is found guilty of an offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC and the death has occurred within a period of seven years of the marriage, the accused cannot be automatically held guilty for the offence punishable under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC by employing the presumption under Section 113A of the Evidence Act. Unless the prosecution establishes that some act or illegal omission by the accused has driven the deceased to commit the suicide, the conviction under Section 306 would not be tenable,” Justice Gavai said in the recent judgment.

In the present case, the apex court set aside the conviction of the husband for abetment of suicide of his wife but upheld the case of dowry harassment against him.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dduai5/article30453404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-automatic-conviction-for-abetment-of-suicide-says-sc/article30453405.ece
54,2020/01/01,"Muslims have no reason to fear CAA, says Paswan","Lok Janshakti Party leader and Union Minister Ramvilas Paswan has accused the Opposition parties of spreading misinformation regarding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), asserting that Muslims have no reason to fear as the Act is meant only to grant citizenship and not revoke the status of any existing citizen.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Paswan said, has repeatedly clarified that the CAA is only to grant citizenship and not snatch it. “This law has no connection with citizenship of any Indian citizen. It is solely to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikh Jain, Buddhists and Parsis coming from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. No Muslim citizen of India need to worry about anything,” Mr. Paswan said.

‘NRC not finalised’

He said the National Register of Citizens, which is often linked to the CAA, has so far not been finalised. “The NRC will not be connected to any religion. No person can be denied citizenship on the basis of religion,” Mr. Paswan added.

The National Population Register is a usual enumeration exercise which does not distinguish between citizens and non-citizens, he said. “The UPA in 2004 could have repealed the 2003 Amendment that first introduced the concept of NRC. Instead of repealing it, the then Home Minister P. Chidambaram said on May 7, 2010 that NRC will follow NPR. Mr. Chidambaram had also added at that time that Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are unable to produce documents about birth place and date of birth will not targeted. No Indian citizens will be harassed,” Mr. Paswan added.

The LJP chief’s comments come at a time when other NDA allies, including the Akali Dal and the Janata Dal (U) have expressed varied views on the CAA following nationwide protests against it. While both parties supported the legislation in Parliament, they have since spoken out against it.

56,2020/01/01,"Internet, SMS connectivity patchy in Kashmir Valley","The J&K administration’s move to restore SMS facility did not succeed on Wednesday, as all private cellular companies, except the semi-government BSNL, could not uplink the systems.

Scores of hospitals in the Valley remained without Internet facility for most part of the day, contrary to the government’s New Year announcement to start it by Tuesday midnight after the 150-day shutdown.

Tens of thousands of users of companies like Airtel and Jio Reliance complained that the promised service was not available on their phones on Wednesday. Around 40 lakh post-paid users were promised with the restoration on the eve of the New Year.

Officials at Srinagar’s top government-run hospitals, including the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital, the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), the Bones and Joints Hospital, the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital and the G.B. Pant Children hospital, said the Internet facility could not be restored by the cellular companies.

Healthcare took a major hit in both the government and the private hospitals after the government stopped Internet on August 5, the day the Centre revoked J&K’s special status. “We would share patients’ reports on WhatsAap groups to save lives of those in emergency situation. Even mobile Internet and Internet at private hospitals should be restored since they also cater to a large population,” said Irfan Ahmad, a cardiologist.

When contacted, J&K government spokesman Rohit Kansal told The Hindu, “We have issued orders for restoration of SMS on all post-paid mobile cards. BSNL has made it operational and Airtel and Jio Reliance are working towards it. They are facing technical problems not related to orders anyway. We are pushing them to restore as early as possible.”

He said the Internet facility had been restored in 28 hospitals. “There are cases of glitches and non-payment of fee too. We are in the process of restoring others too.”

A senior official of Airtel, on condition of anonymity, said the cellular company was alerted “very late about restoration of services”. “Systems take time to uplink the service.

The CPI in a statement opposed the rail hike and demanded a rollback.

58,2020/01/01,Bangladesh restores mobile networks along its borders with India,"Bangladesh has reversed its decision of shutting down mobile networks along the country’s over 4,000 km-long borders with India, two days after asking telecom operators to block the services citing “security” reasons, according to media reports on January 1.

The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) on Sunday directed the shut down of around 2,000 base transceiver stations, affecting around 1 crore users in 32 districts that share border with India and Myanmar.

The government’s directive to the telecommunication operators came days after India’s Parliament passed the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), causing much concern in Dhaka that it could lead to an influx of migrants from India.

The reports did not give any reason for reversing the government’s decision on Sunday.

The BTRC, in its order to telecommunications service providers- Grameenphone, Teletalk, Robi and Banglalink- said network coverage within one kilometre band along the border areas with India should be suspended until further notice “for the sake of the country’s security in the current circumstances.”

Jahurul Haque, BTRC chairman confirmed the latest decision to reverse the restrictions, bdnews24.com reported.

According to The Daily Star, the authorities sent an email to all the mobile operators early today, asking them to restore the networks.

Please reinstate operations of the BTSs (Base Trans-Receiver Stations) near the Bangladesh-India boarder sites immediately, the email, by Mohammad Sohel Rana, deputy director of BTRC’s spectrum management division, said.

Mobile operators also confirmed that they have started to up their network again but it will take about a day to fully reinstate the connections as some of the towers are in very remote areas, the report said.

“As per the directive from BTRC, we have already started reactivating the BTSs located along the border areas. The reactivation process will take a while to complete since a lot of BTSs are involved here,” Shahed Alam, chief corporate and regulatory officer of Robi Axiata Ltd, told The Daily Star.

Earlier, Post and Telecommunication Minister Mustafa Jabbar told The Daily Star that the networks were blocked as the security of the state is the government’s first priority.

He clarified that the decision was not taken by his ministry and they just carried it forward.

The report quoted him saying that the decision was made following a consensus of three to four ministries, and the foreign ministry was leading the efforts.

Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen has said that Bangladesh has requested New Delhi to provide a list of Bangladeshi nationals living illegally in India, “if any”, to be repatriated.

He had also cancelled his visit to India beginning December 12, hours before he was to arrive in New Delhi.

According to diplomatic sources in New Delhi, Mr. Momen and Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal cancelled their visits to India over the situation arising out of the passage of the controversial Citizenship Bill in Parliament.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tik3ou/article30441972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOBILENETWORKTOWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bangladesh-restores-mobile-networks-along-its-borders-with-india/article30451829.ece

All India Mahila Congress (AIMC) president Sushmita Dev said the hike came at a time when the economy was in shambles and it would create a ‘deeper financial crisis’ for citizens.

“Is this a fair new year’s gift to the common man, Congress thinks it is not,” Ms. Dev said and added, “the question is when will the travesty going to end.”

On December 31, the government raised train fares marginally by one paisa to four paise per kilometre depending on the class of travel by a passenger. It also hiked LPG cylinder rates by ₹19.

“One paisa, two paise weigh little and four paisa sounds very small amount but add to that the state of the economy, the rise in unemployment, the fall in rural consumption, where even daal [pulses] and normal cooking oil is unaffordable, how is the common man going to enter 2020 with these kind of hikes? I feel injustice towards the poor people,” Ms. Dev said.

Rawat’s appointment

Asked about some Congress leaders like Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Manish Tewari questioning the appointment of General Bipin Rawat as the new Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), she said, “If some Congress leaders have commented on this, I won’t comment on that. All I will say is that this is Government of India’s decision and we hope that the new CDS will fulfil his duty towards India.”

Ms. Dev said the Congress did not object to any policy decision taken in India’s security interest. “Actions speak louder than words and soon the country will know how they will work. Commenting on it before that will not be right,” she told reporters.

Chowdhury’s tweet

On Tuesday, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury had tweeted critical comments on General Rawat’s appointment as CDS.

The assets, comprising financial securities like shares of the United Breweries Holdings Ltd (UBHL), were attached by the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) court in 2016 when it declared Mallya a proclaimed offender.

Under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code, a court orders attachment of a person’s movable assets after he or she has been declared a proclaimed offender.

A person against whom a warrant has been issued can be declared a proclaimed offender if the court believes that he or she has absconded or is evading execution of warrant.

The consortium of banks earlier filed an application before the special court, seeking release of Mallya’s movable assets to utilise them for repayment of loans given to him.

62,2020/01/01,ATF cost up 2.6%; non-subsidised LPG price hiked by ₹19,"Jet fuel or ATF price was on Wednesday hiked by 2.6% and that of non-subsidised cooking gas LPG by ₹19 per cylinder on the back of a rise in international rates.

Price of Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), used to power aeroplanes, was raised by ₹1,637.25 per kilolitre, or 2.6%, to ₹64,323.76 per kl in Delhi, according to a price notification of state-owned fuel retailers.

This is the second straight monthly increase in rates warranted due to firming up of prices in the international market.

In India, which is dependent on imports to meet 84% of its oil needs, prices of domestic fuels are at par with benchmark international prices.

ATF price was on December 1 increased by a marginal ₹13.88 per kl.

The two back-to-back increases have push jet fuel prices to their highest since June 2019.

The hike will add to the burden of cash strapped airlines that are already reeling under pressure from cut-throat competition in the sector.

Despite the increase, at ₹64.32 per litre ATF costs less than petrol and diesel. A litre of petrol in the national capital comes for ₹75.14 while diesel is priced at ₹67.96 a litre.

Simultaneously, oil companies also raised the price of non-subsidised LPG to ₹714 per 14.2-kg cylinder from ₹695 previously.

This is the fifth straight monthly increase in cooking gas prices since September 2019. In all, non-subsidised cooking gas prices have gone up by ₹139.50 per cylinder in the last five months.

Non-subsidised LPG is the gas that consumers buy after exhausting their quota of 12 cylinders of 14.2-kg at sub-market or subsidised rates of ₹495.86.

LPG, as well as ATF prices, are revised on 1st of every month based on the average international rate for benchmark fuel and foreign exchange rate in the preceding month.

Also, the price of kerosene sold through the public distribution system (PDS) was increased by 26 paise to ₹35.58 per litre in Mumbai.

This is in accordance with the 2016 decision to raise rates by 25 paise a litre every month till subsidy on the fuel is eliminated.

Congratulating General Bipin Rawat for his appointment as the country’s first Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), Mr. Modi said he is an outstanding officer who has served India with great zeal.

“Creation of the Department of Military Affairs with requisite military expertise and institutionalisation of the post of CDS is a momentous and comprehensive reform that will help our country face the ever-changing challenges of modern warfare,” the Prime Minister tweeted.

The “institution” of CDS carries tremendous responsibility of modernising the country’s military forces, and reflecting the “hopes and aspirations” of 1.3 billion Indians, Mr. Modi said.

“As the first CDS takes charge, I pay homage to all those who have served and laid down their lives for our nation. I recall the valiant personnel who fought in Kargil, after which many discussions on reforming our military began, leading to today’s historic development,” he tweeted.

The appointment of Gen. Rawat as CDS came in for criticism by Opposition parties with the Congress raising several questions over the issue, saying the government has started on a “wrong foot”.

“We have the Line of Actual Control with China, the border question is yet to be settled. However, we have made a little progress in maintaining peace and tranquillity along the borders and I am sure that situation will prevail,” he said adding that by maintaining peace on the borders “we can set the stage for an eventual solution”. Gen. Naravane was talking to the media after a ceremonial guard of honour outside South Block a day after he took over as the 28th Chief of Army Staff.

Stating that both the western and northern borders were equally important, he said that while we had been giving attention in the past to the western front, “the northern front also now requires equal attention.” “We are now going in for capability enhancement on our northern borders which includes the north-east parts.”

India and China have different perceptions on the over 3,400-km-long border and have held several rounds of Special Representative talks in an attempt to resolve it.

Talking of his top priority as Army chief, Gen. Naravane said it “will always remain to be ever ready for any challenge and to be operationally prepared at all times” which would happen through modernisation.

“We will continue to build up our capabilities, especially in the north and north-eastern regions of country,” he stressed, adding, “there will also be emphasis on improving the security awareness among the rank and file with special attention to the issue of human rights.”

Over the last few months as Vice-Chief of the Army, Gen Naravane made a strong pitch for indigenisation of defence equipment and not waiting to build the best equipment. At an industry interaction a couple of months back, he called on the Indian industry to build products which would be inducted and subsequently improved based on their performance in the field.

His comments come in the backdrop of his recent comments condemning student protests which drew sharp responses from political parties and on social media.

“Armed forces stay away from politics. We work according to the directions of the government in power,” he said talking to the media after reviewing a tri-service guard of honour.

Gen. Rawat said the CDS would remain neutral within the Service [Army] and to all three services. “We have to achieve more through integration. The synergised effort should not be the sum total of the three. It should be more,” he observed.

The broad mandate of the CDS includes bringing about jointness in operations, logistics, transport, training, support services, communications, repairs and maintenance of the three Services, “within three years of the first CDS assuming office.”

The mandate also includes promoting jointness in procurement, training and staffing for the Services; facilitation of restructuring of military commands for optimal utilisation of resources by bringing about jointness in operations, including through “establishment of joint/theatre commands and promoting use of indigenous equipment by the Services.”

There is no consensus among the Services on the formation on theatre commands and the Air Force has been especially opposed to the move.

On this, Gen. Rawat said there were methods to achieve theaterisation. “I think we are copying Western methods and what others have done. We can have our own systems. We will work out a mechanism,” he stated.

A day after Delhi experienced the coldest recorded day in December, the sun shone bright bringing some respite though icy winds swept the city which saw a low of 4.8℃.

Delhiites would get some relief from the frigid conditions as the India Meteorological Department said that there would be “no cold wave in Delhi till January 4 (Saturday) and temperatures will rise further“.

There will be moderate fog in Delhi on Wednesday and very light rain on Thursday.

According to a forecast by the MeT Department, snowfall is most likely in Himachal Pradesh’s Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur districts on December 31 and in Kashmir Valley from January 1.

71,2020/01/01,Kashmiri dry fruit sellers allege harassment by Lucknow police,"A group of Kashmiri dry fruit traders on Tuesday alleged that Uttar Pradesh police personnel were harassing and obstructing them from sell their products roadside. A State police officer, however, said they were selling in a no-vending zone and the restrictions were due to the security arrangements made for the New Year.

This comes nine months after two Kashmiri men selling dry fruits on the roadside in the State capital were assaulted over their identity by saffron-clad persons, leading to the arrest of four members of a right-wing group Vishwa Hindu Dal.

Traders from Jammu and Kashmir travel to Lucknow each year on the onset of winter to sell their cottage products like dry fruits and shawls.

The group of traders lay their spread roadside at the Samta Mulak crossing, near the Gomti river. However, they alleged that for the past few days policemen had been harassing them and even snatched away their Aadhaar cards, their proof of identity, without offering them an explanation.

“We came from so far to earn our livelihood. Police is harassing us. The Nagar Nigam (municipality corporation) people come and stuff our dry fruits into their vehicle. Nobody listens to us,” Ishtiaq Dar, one of the traders, told media.

Talking to The Hindu, Mr. Dar, who hails from Kulgam, said on Tuesday two policemen came and asked them to stop selling their goods.

“They tore the packets...we suffered losses. Four-five packets of each one of us,” he said.

The Kashmiri traders also said the policemen used sticks and snatched their Aadhaar cards.

A similar incident took place a few days earlier, they said. Around two weeks ago, Mr. Dar said the police took away Aadhaar cards of five Kashmiri traders and are yet to return them.

“They didn’t give us any reason,” he said. He also alleged that the policemen not only take away their dry fruit packets but also demand bribes, abused and hit them.

Moving around Lucknow without their identity proofs makes us vulnerable to further harassment, the men said.

“We can’t move around with our Aadhar card,” said another trader Riaz.

Circle Officer Gomti Nagar Santosh Singh said the “Samta Mulak crossing does not come under any vending zone.”

Considering rash driving and accidents due to New Year’s rush, footpaths are cleared every year (during this time) and stalls are also removed, he said. “The persons can be from any state, Haryana, Punjab, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh or Kashmir, we behave with them in the same manner,” Mr. Singh said.

Mr. Dar said a senior police officer in Hazratganj spoke to them and assured that they would not be harassed. “He gave us his phone number and said, if you have a problem and if anyone harasses you, you call on this number and we will reach you with help,” Mr. Dar said.

“We just want to sell our products and want an end to this harassment,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/zh4efj/article30447198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kashmiri-dry-fruit-sellers,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kashmiri-dry-fruit-sellers-allege-harassment-by-lucknow-police/article30447199.ece
72,2020/01/01,Who will police the police? Supreme Court asked 38 years ago,"Police brutality and detention of students, activists and citizens, including allegations of custodial violence against a 66-year-old Muslim cleric in Uttar Pradesh in connection with anti-CAA protests bring to the fore the Supreme Court’s 38-year-old question: “Who will police the police?”

An exaggerated insistence on “proof beyond reasonable doubts” by courts in cases of custodial violence by ignoring ground realities and fact-situations would make the justice delivery system suspect, the apex court has cautioned. If courts adopt an “unrealistic approach,” it would only reinforce a belief in the police that no harm would come to them if an odd prisoner dies in the lock-up.

“Who will police the police? Police methodology with sinister potential to human liberty deserves strong disapproval and constitutional counteraction by this court,” the Supreme Court observed in Prem Chand versus Union of India in 1981.

‘Despicable practice’

Use of force in custody against a helpless and lonely individual is unlike muscling back a violent mob or a “violent bad character.” “The use of force against an individual in custody in his loneliness and helplessness is a grossly unlawful and most degrading and despicable practice that requires to be condemned in the strongest of terms, and we do so,” the court had observed.

Nothing is as degrading as the police “practising torture of any kind” in custody, especially when India had adopted and signed the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment in October 1997.

In the D.K Basu judgment, the court held that custodial violence, including torture and death in lock-ups, strikes a blow at the rule of law. The same judgment insists that police officers carrying out arrest should wear “accurate, visible and clear identification and name tags with their designations.”

Dual role

The court, in Prakash Singh case, held that the Constitution mandates the police to perform their dual role of a law enforcing agency and an institution to protect citizens’ rights with autonomy, accountability and efficiency. The Code of Conduct for the Police in India of 1960 insists that police personnel recognise themselves as members of the public.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/society/ko7tf7/article30450007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29SMKASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-courts-38-year-old-question-who-will-police-the-police/article30446854.ece
73,2020/01/01,14-year-old Bengaluru boy’s message on gender equality gains traction in Kadapa,"‘I am a boy and I am a feminist’, reads the poster created by Abhiram Rachamadugu from Aditi Mallya School in Bengaluru.

The poster, presented in a comic format, stresses the need for boys to proudly call themselves feminists, dispelling the misconception that it is a term reserved for women. Fourteen-year-old Abhiram, who volunteers at Vijay Foundation Trust, created the poster to highlight the point that gender equality is intrinsic to the development of a society.

Releasing the poster, Collector Ch. Hari Kiran underscored the importance of instilling the values such as feminism in children and suggested the poster be displayed in schools across the district. Vijay Foundation Trust president P.V. Sandhya, member Durga Kumari and Bonnie Zaire, a professor from Virginia Tech University (USA), took part.

The series of cartoons in the poster, presented in the form of a conversation between two boys and an elderly man, deals with serious issues like foeticide, infanticide and dowry. The aim was to drive home the point that these should be a matter of concern to everyone, regardless of the gender.

74,2020/01/01,Former TDP MLA holds ‘silent protest’ against shifting of Capital,"Telugu Desam Party(TDP) leaders have demanded scrapping the idea of shifting State Capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam, saying travelling thither from the district would be a costly affair not just for the common people but also for the officials.

Former TDP Anantapur Urban MLA Vykuntam Prabhakar Chowdary, joined by his party leaders, sat on a day-long ‘silent protest’ at his residence in the city. After ending his 12-hour protest in the evening, Mr. Chowdary said while all other State capitals in the South will be much closer, Visakhapatnam will be 913 km from Hindupur in the district.

Displaying a distance chart from Anantapur to Pondicherry, Chennai, Bengaluru, Thiruvanantapuram, and Mumbai, Mr. Chowdary and Singanamala TDP in-charge Bandaru Sravani decried the YSR Congress Party’s idea to shift the Capital.

‘Unwise decision’

“If the government thinks there was an insider trading and some TDP leaders had benefited out of the information on Amaravati as Capital, they should punish those involved in it. Why should the people be punished for it?” said Mr. Chowdary.

He added: “Decision on Amaravati as Capital was taken unanimously in the Assembly, and if the YSRCP had any problem with it, they should have contested the choice then itself.”

As per Sribagh Pact, Kurnool should be the Capital and Guntur should get High Court or vice-versa, but shifting the Capital to Visakhapatnam was not a wise decision and it could have political and social implications, he said.

“If we in Rayalaseema start agitation seeking capital at Kurnool, there could be a divide on this issue in the State inviting trouble for everyone;” the TDP leaders said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kuf4le/article30454063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VJPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/former-tdp-mla-holds-silent-protest-against-shifting-of-capital/article30454064.ece
75,2020/01/01,Proposed big projects make no headway,"People in Prakasam district could not have asked for more when the State government came out with a blueprint to locate mega projects like a greenfield sea port at Ramayapatnam, an MNC paper mill at Ravuru and an aerospace hub at Donakonda etc.,

But these projects failed to take off for various reasons in the year that was. It was Ramayapatnam which was originally selected by the State Cabinet for location of a major public sector port with an initial investment of about ₹10,000 crore. But the previous United Progressive Alliance government overruled the State's recommendation and decided to develop the port at Dugarajapatnam in neighbouring SPSR Nellore district.

Site issue

However, the BJP-led NDA government concluded that the site suggested in the neighbouring district was unviable and wanted the State government to suggest an alternative site. However, the previous TDP government on its own decided to develop a non-major port (NMP) and laid the foundation stone for the mega project on the eve of elections.

On the current status of the port project, official sources here said: “clarity has to still emerge on the nature of port whether it will be a central port, or non-major port or a private one. Once the Central and State governments take a call, land will be acquired in no time.” Already about 3,500 acres of land has been identified for the purpose.

Another major project which could not fructify was the 5-million tonne paper mill proposed by the Asia Paper and Pulp at a cost of ₹24,000 crore. But for the exchanging of Memorandum of Understanding by the previous TDP regime with the Jakarta-based firm, there has been no progress at all in grounding of the project in about 2500 acres of land.

“Much of the land sought had been held by private persons. It will be difficult to ensure the extent of land sought. Allocation of about 1 tmc of water from Ralapadu reservoir is not an easy task as also transportation of water through pipes from the Somasila reservoir in neighbouring district as these projects have no perennial source of water,” the sources explained, adding that the firm had sought an exclusive berth for it in the yet to be developed sea port.

Non-starter

The proposed aerospace hub at Donakonda, which had been in the hot race for location of capital before losing to Thullur was a non-starter too in the year that was. No progress has been made except for signing of Memorandum of Understanding between the promoter firm and the State government at CII-partnership summit in Visakhapatnam.

Meanwhile, Prakasam District Collector P. Bhaskar said none need to feel disheartened as the proposed major industrial projects would take a concrete shape during the middle of 2020. Naval authorities have evinced interested in setting up Very Low Frequency Transmitter towers in Donakonda, a strategic air strip during the erstwhile British regime. Over 2500 acres of land was identified for location of the towers, he explained.

The district formed by merging the most backward parts of Guntur, Nellore and Kurnool for focussed development had not witnessed any significant progress in the last five decades. At least in New Year, these big ticket projects should see the light of the day, opined Prakasam District Development Forum president Ch.

The TikTok video comes in the wake of the government’s plan to have three Capitals – Executive capital in Visakhapatnam, Legislative capital in Amaravati, and Judicial capital in Kurnool.

There is also a demand to make the Rayalaseema region the Executive capital as locating the High Court in the region isn’t enough.

Chandrababu Naidu, along with his Bhuvaneswari offered prayers at the famous Kanaka Durga Temple here on Wednesday morning. He said the New Year should bring happiness to all sections of the society and safety to them in all aspects - money, life and respect. “The New Year 2020 should show a solution to all their problems. Any celebrations would be meaningful if everyone was happy. But the farmers in Amaravati were not happy,” he said in a tweet on Wednesday.

Mr. Naidu had earlier urged his party cadres not to participate in the New Year celebrations as a gesture of solidarity with the farmers protesting against the State government plans to shift the capital to Visakhapatnam.

The TDP cadres were asked to avoid spending on New Year celebrations. “Instead, donate the amount to the Joint Action Committee (JAC) for the protection of Amaravati as the State capital,” he said.

Mr. Naidu plans to visit Amaravati along with his wife.

‘Be with Amaravati farmers on New Year day’

Mr. Naidu in a tweet on Tuesday said: “With thousands of farmers hitting the streets, the TDP has decided to stay away from New Year celebrations this time.” He also invited them to visit Amaravati villages on the first day of the year and stand by the farmers.

89,2020/01/01,"1,125 more secretariat staff needed in Anantapur: Collector","The State government needs to recruit 1,125 more village and ward secretariat employees in Anantapur district by issuing fresh notification, even as it prepares to launch 383 citizen services through these secretariats from January 1 by replacing Mee Seva services.

Grama Swarajya

While Mee Seva centres used to serve 5,000 population, each of the Village and Ward Secretariats would serve 2,000 people in coordination with the Village Volunteers at the grassroots level, said District Collector Gandham Chandrudu here on Monday.

Interacting with mediapersons, he said the State had 657 government administrative employees per one lakh population, against 1,700 in many of the developed nations. “But with the implementation of Gandhiji’s vision of ‘Grama Swarajya’ through the Village Secretariats, we will be inching closer to that ratio, which is considered essential for seamless implementation of welfare schemes. While the district needs 10,725 secretariat staff, there are 8,500-odd, who have joined service,” he said.

New constructions

There was a dearth of applicants for some specific posts with requisite qualification, hence some of the employees could not be recruited, but with fresh notification from the Panchayat Raj Department sometime soon all the posts would be filled to ensure the majority of the citizens’ needs are fulfilled at the secretariat level.

“Based on the survey results of any specific information need of a department conducted by the village volunteers for the 50 families they are responsible, a secretariat employee will identify the beneficiary digging out information from the specific department to get any application processed at mandal/district level,” Mr. Chandrudu explained.

While there are buildings for 570 village and ward secretariats, administrative sanctions were being given for construction of new ones for the remaining out of 1,207 needed.

The infrastructure was being readied for all the secretariats either in own buildings or rented ones to ensure they start functioning from January 1, he observed.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1125-more-secretariat-staff-needed-in-anantapur-collector/article30447364.ece
90,2020/01/01,TTD’s New Year gift: one free ‘laddu’ to every pilgrim,"The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams is contemplating providing one free laddu to every devotee having a darshan of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala. At present, only the devotees who reach Tirumala on foot are provided with one free laddu.

Should the proposal take a concrete shape, then all the devotees visiting the sacred shrine — 80,000 on an average every day — will be provided with one free laddu each.

The intention behind the proposal seems to bring in a uniform price in the sale of laddus, which currently are made available to different sections of the pilgrim community at different rates and check black marketing of the prasadam.

The fact that the VIPs are provided with two free laddus each is believed to have apparently driven the TTD to have a re-look into the indiscriminate subsidies being extended to various sections of devotees.

Additional laddus

According to the proposal, the TTD will provide one free laddu as a gift from the temple administration to every pilgrim having the darshan of the deity. The devotees can also purchase any number of additional laddus at ₹50 each, without any recommendation. At present, additional laddus are provided on the recommendation letters endorsed by certain designated TTD officials.

The management feels that the profit earned by way of marketing the laddus at the existing selling price will cover the loss arising out of the proposed ‘one free laddu to every pilgrim’ scheme.

If every thing goes on expected lines, the proposal is likely to be grounded either on ‘Vaikunta Ekadasi’ festival day on January 5 or Makara Sankranti on January 15.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rgjadl/article30447280.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01VJLADDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ttds-new-year-gift-one-free-laddu-to-every-pilgrim/article30447281.ece
91,2020/01/01,Umamaheswara Rao launches 24-hour deeksha in Vijayawada,"Former Water Resources Minister Devineni Umamaheswara Rao launched a 24-hour deeksha (fast) to protest against the proposal to have three separate Legislative, Executive and Judicial capitals, at Gollapudi Centre here on Tuesday.

The former Minister who started his fast at 11 a.m. on Tuesday will continue the same till 11 a.m. on Wednesday.

Addressing a gathering from the dais, Mr. Umamaheswara Rao said it was a pity Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was not even taking a peek at the farmers of 29 villages from Amaravati area even though they were protesting against the three different capitals.

He said that some people connected with the YSR Congress Party government tried to block floodwaters flowing in Krishna river with the intention of flooding Amaravati area, but their ploy did not work.

The people of Amaravati stayed up all night to prevent people with vested interests from breaching the Krishna River flood banks to flood Amaravati area, he claimed.

Mr. Umamaheswara Rao charged that the prime objective behind sabotaging Amaravati was to benefit Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhara Rao.

Mr. Umamaheswara Rao recalled how Mr. Jagan who was the then Leader of the Opposition refused to come to the function organised to the lay the foundation stone of the new capital. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and all the important people in the country attended the function, but not Mr. Jagan, he said.

94,2020/01/01,I was considered for PM post in 2004: S.M. Krishna,"The suave and U.S.-educated politician S.M. Krishna was actually being considered for the prime ministerial post in 2004 by the Congress when he was the Chief Minister of Karnataka, according to his own disclosure.

In his autobiography titled Smrithivaahini, which is set to be released on January 4 in Bengaluru, the 87-year-old former External Affairs Minister, who severed his nearly five-decade association with the Congress and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2017, has recalled that this piece of information had been shared by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself.

Before the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, Mr. Singh had told his college-mate and economist K. Venkatagiri Gowda (who hails from Karnataka) that Mr. Krishna was doing good work in Karnataka as Chief Minister and either he [Mr. Singh] or Mr. Krishna will become the Prime Minister if the Congress-led UPA comes to power in 2004, says the book.

Mr. Gowda had later discussed this with his close circles, the former Chief Minister notes. However, the Congress which went to Assembly polls in Karnataka in 2004 under the leadership of Mr. Krishna, who had drawn the attention of the country with his work as the Chief Minister, lost the elections.

Mr. Krishna says in the book that former Prime Minister and Janata Parivar leader H.D. Deve Gowda had tried to join the Congress twice.

According to him, Mr. Deve Gowda had visited his ministerial quarters in an autorickshaw during the Emergency when D. Devaraj Urs was the Chief Minister. He conveyed his desire to join the Congress, while expressing displeasure over lack of unity among the Opposition parties. “But I told him that it was not nice on his part to join the Congress as he had made serious allegations against Mr. Urs and vowed to prove them too,” he says, and adds that Mr. Gowda accepted his advice.

Again in the ’80s, he himself had made efforts to woo Mr. Gowda and S.R. Bommai to the Congress after the then Prime Minister Charan Singh quit, Mr. Krishna says. He had even organised a meeting between them and senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee. But the two leaders from Karnataka did not come back after that, he recalls.

Mr. Krishna, who hails from the dominant Vokkaliga community, has said that Mr. Gowda used to telephone him several times for transfers of officials and other issues when he became Chief Minister in 1999. “I had given standing instructions to my secretary M.K. Shankaralinge Gowda to okay all works sought by Mr. Gowda.” But Mr. Krishna has expressed disappointment that despite this, no bonding emerged between him and Mr. Gowda. “Perhaps, I may have erred by not creating an opportunity to sit across the table with Mr. Gowda to discuss various issues. Because of this, the gap between us started increasing. I cannot remember him having any soft corner for me when I was the Chief Minister,” he says.

Association with The Hindu

S.M. Krishna, who studied postgraduation in law in the U.S. by obtaining Fulbright Scholarship, has recalled his association with The Hindu in his autobiography.

“Ours was the only house (in Somanahalli of Maddur taluk in Mandya district) to get The Hindu in those days,” Mr. Krishna recalls. Though his father never had college education, he was able to read and understand The Hindu, he says in the book.

Heaps of praises for Sonia Gandhi

S.M. Krishna, who has quit the Congress and joined the BJP, has showered praises on Congress top leader Sonia Gandhi in his autobiography.

“Sonia Gandhi is a person who has fundamentally loved Indian culture from the bottom of her heart,” he says in the book.

The reference to her has been made in connection with a request by a monk from the Belagavi branch of Ramakrishna Ashram to him as the then Chief Minister to grant land in Belagavi to the ashram to build a memorial as Swami Vivekananda had stayed in that house during his visit in 1892.

The Chief Secretary had turned down the request as that land belonged to the government guesthouse. But the matter had reached Ms. Gandhi, who in turn told Mr. Krishna that it was better to give the land to the ashram, he says.

Following this, Mr. Krishna not only issued an order transferring the land to the ashram, but also got a copy of the order issued to the ashram from Ms. Gandhi during her visit to the State, he says.

When Kengal Hanumanthaiah declared a holiday

The conflict between the judiciary and legislature was witnessed in the 1950s too when Kengal Hanumanthaiah was the Chief Minister, according to former Chief Minister S.M. Krishna.

In his autobiography, he has narrated how the then Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court Medhappa had taken up a contempt of court case against Mr. Hanumanthaiah in connection with an incident. Both were strong personalities who were not willing to take a back seat.

Finally, the Chief Justice was about to retire on a Saturday and he wanted to pronounce the order on Friday. But following the advise of his lawyer that such a situation may result in him going to jail owing to paucity of time to file an appeal before the Supreme Court, Mr. Hanumanthaiah used the special power vested in the government to declare a holiday for the High Court on Friday.

This resulted in Mr. Medhappa retiring without pronouncing the order, Mr. Krishna recalls.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7cenok/article30454009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGKRISHNA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i-was-considered-for-pm-post-in-2004-krishna/article30454011.ece
95,2020/01/01,Yediyurappa convenes meeting on border row,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has decided to convene a meeting of Ministers and senior officials to explore legal options before the State government to put an end to the alleged border dispute with Maharashtra.

Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai told presspersons on Wednesday that the meeting would also be attended by legislators and Ministers from Belagavi region and the State’s Advocate General.

“The issue is already a ‘settled matter’. But Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been raking up the issue for political mileage. Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Sharad Pawar too had said long ago that the border row with Karnataka was settled and there was no dispute at all,” Mr. Bommai said.

The Home Minister said the government would challenge the neighbouring State’s claims on its territory in the Supreme Court. For maintaining law and order, the Belagavi police have been instructed to keep vigilance in villages bordering Maharashtra, he said.

The Home Minister condemned Mr. Thackeray’s statement on the alleged border row and said the Mahajan Committee’s report clearly states that Belagavi was part of Karnataka. Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who hails from Belagavi district, warned by saying: “We will teach a fitting lesson to Maharashtra if Kannada-speaking people face any problems in that State (Maharashtra).” Mr. Savadi accused Mr. Thackeray of instigating Shiv Sena workers and stoking tension by raising the border issue.

98,2020/01/01,"HC upholds reservation for SCs, STs in construction work tenders","The High Court of Karnataka has upheld the constitutional validity of a law introduced in 2017 reserving works not exceeding 17.15% and 6.95% of the total construction works, value of which does not exceed ₹50 lakh in tender process, for persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs) respectively.

Justice B. Veerappa delivered the verdict while upholding the constitutional validity of a proviso, introduced by amending Section 6 of the Karnataka Transparency in Public Procurements (KTPP) Act, for reserving works not exceeding 24.1% of the total construction work, executed by inviting tenders under the KTPP Act for SCs and STs.

Vishwanath H.M., a class 1 contractor from Bengaluru, had challenged the reservation in construction works while contending that reservation was a violation of the constitutional provisions, while claiming that reservation applies only for education, employment, and not in other subjects, including the tender process.

‘Amendments reasonable’

Rejecting the arguments that reservation in tender process violates constitutional rights, the court held that: “The amendments are not violative of Articles 14, 15, 16, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution of India and are reasonable and in consonance with the right and spirit of the Constitution.”

Stating that the amendments were brought in to reserve construction works in favour of SCs and STs are not violative of the doctrine of the basic structure of the Constitution, the court said that the “amendments are justified”.

“Centuries of calculated oppression and habitual submission reduced a considerable section of our community to a life of serfdom. It would be well-nigh impossible to raise their standards if the doctrine of equal opportunity is strictly enforced in their case. Therefore, the impugned amendments neither prejudice the case of the petitioner nor vitiate the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Part-III (Articles 12 to 35) of the Constitution of India,” the High Court observed.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-upholds-reservation-for-scs-sts-in-construction-work-tenders/article30453450.ece

Fr. Antony Sebastian, chairperson of the commission, said they had urged officials of the Department of Public Instruction and Labour Department to conduct the resurvey in Chikkamagaluru and Raichur.

“We have observed that the number of children who are either dropouts or have never enrolled in school are high in these districts,” he said. KSCPCR had observed that in Chikkamagaluru district, a large number of families had migrated from several parts of North India to work in the coffee plantation and the children of these families were not admitted in school.

Before the commencement of this academic year, the department found that 16,853 children between the ages six and 14 were out of school. Of this, 31.1% were children of migrant labourers. The largest number of out-of-school children has been identified in Bengaluru.

To tackle the issue of children who belong to families who have migrated, the department had asked teachers to visit slums and bus stands during the night, twice a month, in order to bring them to the mainstream.

This academic year, notices were issued to 8,627 parents whose children have been absent from schools for seven consecutive days without prior permission. In this list, it was reported that there were zero absentees from Raichur district and therefore the commission has ordered a resurvey in Raichur.

Officials of the Department of Public Instruction did not comment on whether a resurvey would be conducted, but acknowledged that there was a need for the reporting mechanism to be more robust.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/up1uj6/article30453443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGCHILDREN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kscpcr-urges-dpi-to-conduct-resurvey-of-out-of-school-children-in-2-districts/article30453444.ece
100,2020/01/01,Book on Kukkarahalli Kere released,"A coffee table book on Kukkarahalli Kere in the city was released on Wednesday to create greater public awareness on the imperatives of conserving the lake and the environment.

The book, published by Mysore Grahakara Parishat (MGP) in association with Wild Mysuru, was released by students of Environmental School Warden Project of Kautilya Vidyalaya who stressed the need to put environmental conservation theory into practice.

Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar pointed out that it is rare to have a lake in the middle of a city as a lung space and it should be conserved. However, conservation efforts should be preceded by a proper understanding of the lake ecosystem as good intentions to protect them alone will not suffice. The general imagination of the people about a lake is that of a water body replete with water throughout the year, a few islets and a walking path around it. But in reality it is in the shallow portions of the lake where a lot of biological activities take place but this is damaged in the overall thrust on de-siltation, he added.

Bhamy V. Shenoy of the MGP said the book covers various aspects of the lake pertaining to its flora and fauna with hundreds of photographs. As iconic as Chamundi Hills, Kukkarahalli has suffered, not withstanding efforts to conserve it.

The objective of publishing the book is to educate the public on the importance of Kukkarahalli Kere which is spread over 104 acres. It has 400 species of trees and plants, along with 189 species of birds of which 45 are migratory species, 14 species of mammals, 85 species of butterflies, 37 species of spiders, 20 species of reptiles and millions of insects all of which play a major role in the environment, said Mr. Shenoy.

G. Hemantha Kumar, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Mysore, U.N. Ravikumar, environmentalist, and scores of citizens and eco activists were present.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ix7j2o/article30452842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01MYSBOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/book-on-kukkarahalli-kere-released/article30452765.ece
101,2020/01/01,Kannada being taught in all but 21 schools: DPI report,"While there was a huge uproar in 2019 about the need for schools in the State to teach Kannada as the first or second language in a phased manner, reports collated by officials of the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) claim that all schools barring 21 are teaching Kannada.

Out of the 21 schools, 15 are affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), and four to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations. One school each belongs to those that follow the State syllabus and the International Baccalaureate. The reports have been collated from 21,604 private schools across the State.

Five other schools have reportedly been teaching Kannada as the first language, although as per the rules, schools should be teaching Kannada as the first or second language from classes one to three for this academic year. The Kannada Language Learning Act 2015, which came into effect from the 2017-2018 academic year, mandates that all schools introduce Kannada in a phased manner.

‘Gross underestimation’

Several parents and department officials feel that the report is a gross underestimate and there are more than 21 schools in the State that are not teaching the language. “We want the Education Department to conduct a more accurate survey and make surprise visits to schools to see if Kannada is being taught,” said Ramesh S., whose child studies in a CBSE school.

In fact, the Managements of Independent CBSE Schools’ Association has acknowledged that teaching Kannada as the first and second language is not a feasible option. They are however trying to negotiate with the State government on teaching it as third language.

Currently, schools that violate norms can can attract penalty up to ₹500. Experts argue that the penalty needs to be increased. In August 2018, the Kannada Development Authority had sent a proposal to the government seeking cancellation of No Objection Certificates of some private schools on the grounds that they were not teaching Kannada.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kannada-being-taught-in-all-but-21-schools-dpi-report/article30452732.ece

“It is unfortunate that we are in different parties. But that does not stop me from saying that he is my leader. I have worked with him in the past and I have great regards for him. I met him when he was recuperating in hospital a few days ago,” he said.

There are some forces that are opposed to me. They keep spreading rumours that Mr. Siddaramaiah was responsible for the fall of the coalition government. “I told him about that.

103,2020/01/01,"Dalits told to join hands with those opposing CAA, NRC","Cautioning the Dalit community against NRC and CAA, Vijaykumar Salve, chief of Samata Sainik Dal of Solapur, has said that if Dalits do not protest against CAA and NRC, then there will come a time when Dalits would be asked to prove their citizenship.

“Do not be under the impression that NRC and CAA have nothing to do with Dalits. The core agenda of the BJP is to push Manuvada that discriminates against people on the basis of caste and gender. To achieve this, the BJP will not hesitate to bring in the required amendments to the Constitution. Therefore, it is time that Dalits joined hands with those opposing CAA and NRC,” he said.

He was speaking at the 202nd Bhima-Koregaon victory day of the Mahars (Dalits) over the Peshwas of Maharashtra organised by the district chapter of Buddhist Society of India at Buddha Vihar on Wednesday.

Stating that during the Koregaon battle the Dalits fought the Peshwas using weapons such as swords, he said that today, Dalits should fight people of a similar [Peshwas] mindset using the pen by treating it as a weapon.

“It is the pen that can act as the biggest weapon against the BJP government which is determined to divide the nation on caste lines and implement the ideas of Manusmiriti which was burnt by Ambedkar,” he said.

Accusing the BJP of trying to amend the basic principles of the Constitution, Mr. Salve asserted that just because the party has majority in Parliament, it cannot dare alter the Constitution.

“If the BJP has majority in Parliament, people have bigger strength to show to the BJP that it is trying to commit a grave mistake,” he said.

Raising the issue of CAA and NRC, Dalit leader, Chandrashekhar Kodabagi said that CAA has united a vast population of the nation against the BJP.

“The BJP was under the belief that it could implement any Act and people will sit quiet. In fact, the CAA has united Dalits and minorities,” he said.

Accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of behaving like Prime Minister of the BJP and not of the nation, he said that Mr. Modi and his party leaders are trying to gag the voices of people.

“By describing their critics as Urban Naxals and anti-nationals, the BJP is making every effort to silent its critics. But people should keep fighting the BJP to keep the aspirations of the Constitution alive,” he said.

On the occasion, a special calendar published by veteran journalist Anil Hosmani on the important days of the Dalit movement was released.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dalits-told-to-join-hands-withthose-opposing-caa-nrc/article30452498.ece
104,2020/01/01,New director promises to turn Rangayana proactive,"Collective efforts will be made to revive Rangayana in Kalaburagi by focussing on theatre-based activities and conducting stage plays regularly, its director Prabhakar Joshi has said.

A journalist-cum-senior theatre personality from Sedam taluk in Kalaburagi, Mr. Joshi, who was recently appointed to the post assumed charge here on Tuesday.

Addressing a press conference at the Rangayana auditorium on Wednesday, Mr. Joshi said that vacancies would be filled on a priority basis. At present, the Rangayana, which has been surrounded by controversies since its establishment, has only five employees against the 15 posts, including 12 artistes and three technicians, he added.

Asked about his plans, Mr. Joshi said that having worked in theatre for years, he would definitely come out with plans and turn the dormant Rangayana into a proactive unit. “First and foremost, we would fill vacant posts of artistes and train them for repertory and stage plays,” he said.

Mr. Joshi shared his idea about bringing together a group of amateur and professional theatre enthusiasts and also comb for the local artistes in schools and colleges to provide a platform to display their talents in performing arts.

Mr. Joshi said that he would ensure that dreams of stalwarts like B.V. Karanth and the intention behind setting up such units are realised, by focussing on stage plays.

“Rangayana Kalaburagi has failed to live up to the expectations of theatre lovers in the region; but I don’t want to dig up old bones. We will try not to repeat the mistakes that Rangayana made in the past,” Mr. Joshi said.

To a question, Mr. Joshi said that Rangayana Kalaburagi was receiving an annual budget of ₹ 1 crore. He would also propose to the State government to double the annual budget.

To a query whether Rangayana would reinstate artistes sacked by Ranga Samaj, Mr. Joshi said that only Ranga Samaj has the powers to take a decision in the matter.

Accepting a suggestion to form an advisory committee, Mr. Joshi said that it will depend on the provisions of the Rangayana.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-director-promises-to-turn-rangayana-proactive/article30452457.ece
105,2020/01/01,MCC team visits Nagpur landfill site to study bio-mining legacy waste,"A team of officials and people’s representatives from the city visited the landfill site in Nagpur on Monday to study the prospects of carrying out bio-mining of legacy waste piling up at the Waste Treatment Plant in J.P. Nagar in Mysuru.

The seven-member team led by Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar also comprised Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde and Mayor Pushpalatha Jagannath. At the site in Nagpur, a private solid waste management services company is carrying out bio-mining of legacy waste.

Mr. Sankar will be submitting a report to Minister in charge of Mysuru district V. Somanna during the Karnataka Development Programme (KDP) review meeting in the city on January 3.

The private company – Zigma Global Environ Solutions – is handling 10 lakh tonnes of legacy waste spread across 25-30 acres in Nagpur.

At J.P. Nagar in Mysuru, more than two lakh tonnes of legacy waste has been piled up across 10 to 12 acres of land with the waste treatment facilities falling woefully short.

Against an installed capacity of 200 tonnes, Mysuru generates 450 tonnes of waste every day. The accumulating mountains of untreated waste over the last 20-25 years had crossed two lakh tonnes, posing a health and environmental hazard to a large population residing around J.P. Nagar.

The team from Mysuru also included Deputy Mayor Shafi Ahmed, MCC Health Officers Jayant and Nagaraju, and chairperson of the MCC’s Standing Committee Shobha Sunil.

Dr. Nagaraju said the task to clear the waste in Mysuru was relatively easier. Unlike the “mess” in Nagpur, where 10 lakh tonnes of legacy waste was being cleared on 30 acres, Mysur had accumulated two lakh tonnes across 10 to 15 acres of land. “It is easier to process in Mysuru”, he said.

The cost for clearing the legacy waste in Mysuru will be around ₹18 crore. “It will take 18 to 24 months to clear the untreated waste”, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mdrn90/article30453255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01MYSYARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mcc-team-visits-nagpur-landfill-site-to-study-bio-mining-legacy-waste/article30452413.ece

The final rites were performed in his home town of Sankeshwar on Wednesday.

He was known to be a close follower of the former Chief Minister S. Bangarappa. He served as Minister for Irrigation in the Bangarappa Cabinet. He had been elected four times from Sankeshwar, before delimitation of constituencies.

He was involved in the cooperative movement and served on the board of two sugar factories in Belagavi district.

107,2020/01/01,Mysuru ranked 107th in Swachh Survekshan quarterly rankings,"The city’s quarterly ranking under Swachh Survekshan 2020 (SS 2020) has stunned the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) which has averred that it is not a reflection of the overall standards of hygiene and cleanliness of Mysuru.

In the first quarterly survey for the period April to June, Mysuru was ranked 154th in the country while it was ranked 107th for the period July to September. The ranking of the 3rd quarterly is expected to be merged with the overall rankings to be announced later in the year. Among cities with population above 1 lakh and below 10 lakh, Mysuru was ranked 9th in the second quarterly rankings. Mysuru was ranked 3rd overall in the country last year and it was adjudged the cleanest city in India in 2016.

This is for the first time that the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs has introduced quarterly survey for ranking of the urban local bodies and has not confined it to a single annual survey as was the case all these years.

According to MoHUA, the objective of the quarterly surveys – termed as SS League 2020 – was to sustain the performance on the cleanliness front and to ensure that the cleanliness standards are maintained throughout the year and not during the survey period only.

And here Mysuru has fared miserably if the rankings are any indication while Indore and Bhopal continued to be ranked among the top 5 cities consistently.

However, D.G. Nagaraj, Health Officer, MCC, averred that Mysuru had the infrastructure in place to outdo other cities whereas other cities that are ranked higher than Mysuru, were lagging in terms of attaining the cleanliness standards.

“Whether it is UGD, availability of public toilets, door-to-door collection of garbage, introduction of zero waste management or waste segregation at source, Mysuru has certain advantages which will come to the fore during the field survey and hence the quarterly ranking based on submission of Management Information System (MIS) documents cannot be a reflection of the ground reality’’, he said.

However, the MCC is not resting on its historical legacy of the infrastructure created by the erstwhile rulers of Mysuru who introduced UGD and water supply in the first half of the 20th century. “The legacy waste of the last few years, that amounts to nearly 2 lakh tonnes, will be tackled’’, he added.

The field survey will be held from January 4 to January 31 and the marks secured during the quarterly survey will receive 25 per cent weightage for the final ranking to be announced sometime during March/April. “It is only 200 marks out of 6,000 and the field survey will shore up our marks and ranking,” say the MCC officials.

For the SS 2020 field survey, there will be emphasis on citizens’ feedback as it fell short of marks in this area last year. Public awareness through street plays has already been launched while the pourakarmikas are working in shifts till 6 p.m. all of which, the authorities hope, will improve Mysuru’s overall ranking.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9ttgpi/article30452852.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01MYSGARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-ranked-107th-in-swachh-survekshan-quarterly-rankings/article30452343.ece

109,2020/01/01,Hassan union ups milk procurement price,"The Hassan Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union has increased milk procurement price by ₹ 1.5 per litre, as a new year gift to the milk producers. Union chairman and former Minister H.D. Revanna announced this at a press conference here on Wednesday.

The union has increased the procurement price for the second time within a month. The price was increased by ₹1 per litre on December 19. With the latest hike, milk producers will be getting ₹ 29 per litre. “Hassan Milk Union is paying the highest amount to milk producers in the State”, Mr. Revanna said.

In the current year, the union earned a profit of ₹40 crore. Of that, ₹25 crore would be returned to the milk producers. The hike in procurement price would cost ₹6.5 crore to the union every month.

Insurance scheme

The union had decided to offer an insurance scheme for cattle. The scheme would cover 30,000 milk producers and 50,000 heads of cattle. The farmers would pay 40% of the premium and the union would bear the remaining share. In case of a farmer’s death, his family would get ₹2 lakh and in case of the death of cattle, the milk producer would get ₹ 50,000. The union had earmarked ₹4 crore for the scheme.

Mr. Revanna said the Hassan union had been demanding an opportunity to sell milk in Bengaluru city. The KMF in Bengaluru had not been able to capture the market in the capital effectively. Companies from neighbouring States had occupied the market. “We are prepared to sell about four to five lakhs litres of milk in the capital”, he said.

The former Minister alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not taken any decision benefiting the farming community in the State. “I don’t know why he is coming to Tumakuru to address the farmers”, he said.

113,2020/01/01,Mysugar will recommence crushing of cane in June 2020: C.T. Ravi,"The iconic Mysugar mill (Mysore Sugar Company Ltd.), the State’s first sugar mill and the only one to be run by the government, is set to recommence operations after two years, according to Sugar Minister C.T. Ravi.

Mr. Ravi, who held a meeting here on Tuesday, announced that the mill would commence crushing operations from June 2020. However, the Minister, who had to face the ire of cane growers for conducting a meeting by “keeping them in the dark”, did not clarify whether the State government itself would continue the operations or would privatise it.

Mr. Ravi, who is also the Minister for Kannada and Culture, convened a meeting with officials, elected representatives and some farmers’ representatives at the mill here to discuss the fate of the eight-decade-old sugar mill. Sumalatha, MP for Mandya, M. Srinivas, MLA for Mandya, and K.T. Srikante Gowda, MLC, attended the meeting, while the other six MLAs from the district abstained.

At the Karnataka Development Programme (KDP) review meeting held at the Mandya Zilla Panchayat auditorium here on December 23, a resolution had been passed to ask the State to lease out Mysugar and Pandavapura Sahakari Sakkare Karkhane (PSSK) sugar mills. Mr. Ravi said it was thus necessary to gather the opinions of cane growers and mills employees before taking a decision.

The Minister said a decision on leasing out Mysugar would be taken in January. He said that a huge sum of ₹428 crore was spent on Mysugar in the past 10 years and that he would speak to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to conduct an inquiry into financial irregularities at the mill.

Meanwhile, cane growers expressed their displeasure with Mr. Ravi for conducting the meeting without consulting them. They raised objection when the Minister was leaving the place.

Mysugar, which was established in 1934, is considered the source of sustenance for cane-growing families in 102 villages in Mandya, Pandavapura and Srirangapatna taluks. It is among the oldest operating mills in Asia. The mill is registered as a ‘sick unit’ with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction owing to the poor administration, nepotism, political interference and financial irregularities.

The mill, once a rich unit, has already decided to relieve 110 of 390 workers under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS). Mysugar has not crushed cane since December 2018 owing to the overhaul issues.

The Sugar Minister also visited the defunct cooperative sector sugar mill of PSSK at Pandavapura on Tuesday. However, his visit lasted just a few minutes. Mr. Ravi assured the sugarcane growers that he would initiate measures to recommence sugar production activities at the mill.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/chvcmu/article30447147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGMNDRAVIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysugar-will-recommence-crushing-of-cane-in-june-2020-ct-ravi/article30447148.ece

116,2020/01/01,Karnataka Minister says govt considering providing “cheap liquor of good quality” to the poor,"Excise Minister H. Nagesh has done it again. The Minister, who recently disowned his statement on ensuring supply of liquor at people’s doorsteps, did a similar U-turn on Tuesday.

Addressing a press conference on the New Year’s Eve, Mr. Nagesh said the Excise Department was considering providing “cheap liquor of good quality” to the poor.

“We are considering providing cheap liquor of good quality to the poor sections of society. The quality will be maintained because cheap liquor should not affect the health of the poor,” Mr. Nagesh told presspersons. He said the matter would be discussed with excise and finance officials before the 2020-21 budget, which is scheduled to be presented on March 5.

Asked whether the department was considering providing subsidised liquor to the poor, he said the subsidy issue would be decided on after consultations with the Finance Department.

Clarification

However, hours after this, the Minister issued a clarification, saying that he never made such a statement.

It may be recalled that Mr. Nagesh had triggered a controversy in September 2019 when he stated that the department was proposing door delivery of liquor in the State. He subsequently made a U-turn on the matter after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa asked him to drop any such proposal. Women activists across the State too had opposed the Minister’s statement.

Asked about boosting liquor sales, Mr. Nagesh said “good decisions” needed to be made, keeping in mind revenue as well as people’s health. “Costly liquor is being sold only in Bengaluru because of celebrations and tourists. It has no takers in other parts of the State. Many people are buying low-cost liquor and there is a huge demand for it,” he said.

On a question about the illegal sale of liquor at ration shops in rural areas, the Minister said such practices have existed for long. “Now, the department has intensified raids and no such shop has been selling liquor,” he claimed.

Granting licence

On opening more liquor shops, the Minister said he was not in favour of granting fresh licences. Already, permission has been granted to open 765 Mysore Sales International Ltd. shops in the State. Of this, 408 are yet to be established. Four shops can be opened in each Assembly constituency. Legislators have to decide on the opening of shops in their constituencies, he said.

On a complaint that officials were asking liquor shop owners to boost the sale of hard liquor by reducing the sale of beer, the Minister said officials have been directed not to regulate the sale of beer in coastal districts. He also said ₹14,400 crore had been mobilised by the end of November, as against the target of ₹20,950 crore set for 2019-20.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lg16gs/article30447085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGNAGESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/minister-nagesh-does-an-about-face-again-on-liquor-supply-to-the-poor/article30447086.ece

119,2020/01/01,Orphanages must get registered under Child Rights Act: Deputy Commissioner,"Deputy Commissioner K. Rajendra has warned of strict action against those running orphanages or centres working for physically challenged persons with government aid, if they have failed to register themselves under the Child Rights Act.

Chairing a meeting on Tuesday, he said that some of the centres lacked basic facilities for children. These centres did not have good toilets, bathrooms, potable water, and other facilities.

“The centres must provide all these facilities, else stringent action would be initiated,” he said.

Mentioning about Muragendra Shivacharya Residential School for Hearing impaired of Ilkal town, Mr. Rajendra said that according to his information, the school building was unfit for students and was under repair. He directed the authorities of the centre to shift the children to a safer building within a week.

He said that social security benefits should reach all such children, which should be ensured by officials of District Health and Family Welfare Department and District Disability Department. “All these students must undergo routine medical check-up and provide them medical facilities wherever needed,” he said.

He said that all physically challenged children residing in the centre who have a BPL card should be identified and given Unique Disability Identity Card (UIDI) being issued by the government for their welfare.

Talking to reporters on Tuesday, former Bantwal MLA B. Ramanath Rai said the dharna will be held before the statue of B.R. Ambedkar, near the Town hall, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

Mr. Rai said allegations are being made that the trouble in the city on December 19 was orchestrated by certain political parties and leaders. The city police are also being accused of acting under the influence of the ruling government in invoking prohibitory orders to quell the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and later firing at the protesters that led to two deaths.

The ongoing magisterial inquiry and investigation by the Criminal Investigation Department into the police firing, he said, will not bring out facts related to the incident. An inquiry by a High Court judge was necessary.

The vedike, Mr. Rai said, wanted the State government to release forthwith compensation to Nauseen and Jaleel, who died in the police firing.

CPI(M) district secretary Vasantha Achari said the vedike has decided to form a fact-finding team for the firing incident.

122,2020/01/01,"Now, paper rice for wedding shower","To mark an Indian wedding, people waste tonnes of rice to shower newly-married couples as part of rituals. To check such wastage of rice, S.B. Harishchandra, Dean, Faculty of Business Studies at Master of Business Administration, Sharnbasva University, has come out with a new initiative even while preserving the sanctity of sentiments associated with marriage. Instead of tossing rice over newly-wed couples at weddings, he urged people to make use of his invention — paper rice.

Dr. Harishchandra, who came up with an idea of producing paper rice, explained that paper rice is made up of waste paper, cardboard and flowers. He collected waste paper and flowers that were then turned into smaller pieces to make liquid paste. Even straw, sugarcane, jute fibre can be used for producing paper rice. The liquid or paste is filled between rollers of a rotary die to produce rice seeds. It takes hardly an hour to prepare 10 kg of paper rice, but the seeds take a longer time to dry. He said that about one lakh weddings take place in India every year, and at least 10 kg of uncooked rice is wasted in every wedding; so around 10,000 quintals of rice are wasted in a year. According to a recent survey by the Union government, approximately 2.5 tonnes of rice are going waste every year in India as a part of the wedding culture, he added.

“It requires 1 kg of raw material to produce 5 kg of paper rice. We can produce 1 kg of paper rice in just ₹ 2 and the produce can be sold at ₹ 5 a kg. And, we are not using plastic for paper rice; hence, it is environment-friendly and free from any kind of toxic. It is non-hazardous to nature,” Dr. Harishchandra said.

“Instead of using rice for showering rituals, the same amount of rice can be used to feed the poor and the needy as the country is still grappling with poverty and hunger. A large population of the nation is undernourished and it dies due to hunger,” he said. Dr. Harishchandra has entered the India Book of Records for his innovative Paper Rice and also Herbal Drinking Water.

123,2020/01/01,Residents rejuvenate garden,"Vexed with official apathy to their issues, residents of Nav Jeevan Layout at P&T Quarters in Kalaburagi have joined hands to take up development of an abandoned garden.

Cutting across age groups, around 200 residents, including women, came together to clean the garden area which had become a garbage dump for years. Now, the green patches of garden attract morning walkers. The beautiful turnaround is the result of the hard work put in by residents of Nav Jeevan Layout.

The 200 residents collected around ₹ 3 lakh and rejuvenated the garden. They have planted around 200 trees of different species besides providing a walking track, sitting benches, playing equipment and drinking water facilities.

Venkat Venu, a senior citizen, said that time is not far when people will have to carry an oxygen cylinder with them when they go out of their houses.

“Trees play a very vital role in maintaining the balance in our ecosystem; they provide fresh air by producing oxygen and also help stabilize the climate. As we are experiencing drastic climate changes, we should take steps to slow down its effects. Within the last few years, tree cover has come down, way less than the minimum 33 per cent. Agro-forestry must be promoted by the government,” he said.

“We started the garden cleaning and plantation drive in our own interest; we wanted our city to be clean and healthy. On several occasions we complained to the city corporation seeking development of the garden; but no action was taken,” another resident from the Layout Uma Konda said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mw76lg/article30446934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGKALABURAGIGARDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/residents-rejuvenate-garden/article30446935.ece
124,2020/01/01,Scrutinising the house of justice,"Centre for Law and Policy Research in collaboration with National Constitution Society chapter of St. Joseph’s College, organised a day-long, intensive conference that reviewed the Supreme Court (SC) decisions of 2019 at St. Joseph’s Institute of Management, Bengaluru. The conference comprised three panel discussions on the topics -- strengthening democracy, SC reform and verdicts concerning religion and faith.

Students from various law schools of Bengaluru had eagerly gathered to know how the judiciary functioned in the year, what features of Constitution were upheld (if they were), the kind of discourses held by the highest court of the land to arrive at some of the landmark judgements and more.

The conference was open to the public as the organisers felt working of the judiciary should be understood by not only students of law but also students from all spheres and concerned citizens. As landmark judgements by the SC would have far-reaching effect on the fundamental fabric of democracy such as -- judicial independence, equality, due process of law, fair electoral process and equal treatment of religions, scrutiny of such decisions was felt critical to democracy.

“Law students must be taught to read judgements critically.” Vakasha Sachdev

“It’s time we teach law students how to study judgements critically and stop placing SC on a pedestal. Actually there hasn’t been a culture of critique of the judiciary in the Indian system which has led to blatant judicial evasion,” Vakasha Sachdev of The Quint suggested. Answering a question from a student, he further clarified: “criticism does not mean you oppose all the decisions or lose faith in the judiciary. But one should know where to draw the line and that’s what legal education is all about.”

The question of ‘what can/cannot come under money bill’ had come before the SC yet again with the enactment of Finance Act, 2017 as a money bill. It is pertinent to mention here that Aadhaar Act was also passed as a money bill in 2016. Explaining the various judgements concerning money bills in a nutshell, advocate Malavika Prasad laid emphasis on the dissenting opinion of J. Chandrachud in Rojer Mathew case delivered on November 13, 2019. “J. Chandrachud argued that the word ‘only’ in Article 110 of the Constitution becomes very crucial in deciding whether a bill can be regarded as a money bill or not. The said article permits the passage of those bills whose provisions deal with only matters relating to taxation and government spending. He further emphasised on the role of Rajya Sabha in representing the interests of the States and held that ‘Bicameralism’ (legislature which has legislators in two separate assemblies), is an essential feature of Indian democracy,” quoted Malavika. Under the garb of money bill, any bill that significantly alters public law cannot be passed by avoiding the upper house’s right to reject, opined the first panel consisting of Malavika, journalist Nitin Sethi and RTI activist, Venkatesh Nayak.

Two other significant matters related to electoral democracy that came before the SC this year were issues concerning electoral bonds and voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT). Speaking on electronic voting machines (EVMs) and VVPAT, Venkatesh Nayak felt: “Mere technological fixes do not address the issue of transparency. What if the software is hacked and the complete vote data is replaced within seconds? Information collected by us through RTI applications and in-congruent responses from the public authorities and EVM manufacturing companies reveal that there is more to this issue. After getting the product specification of EVMs, we were shocked to know that EVMs being used in the general elections do not possess read-only memory which means they can be tampered with between the stage of voting and counting. But the companies and the election commission have denied this fact,” he informed.

When matters that challenge fair electoral process come before the court, court is often not equipped to deal with technological matters. “For instance, Bombay High court asked the forensic unit at Hyderabad to examine an EVM which was produced as evidence in a case filed by an aggrieved MLA from Maharashtra. But we found out later that the tests forensic unit conducted were highly inappropriate. Not just that, the expert who produced the verification test results before the court was, in fact, a ballistic expert!” he quipped.

Coming to the electoral bonds scheme introduced in 2018, Business journalist Nitin Sethi finds the concept of electoral bonds itself highly problematic, as they fail the test of democracy from the yardsticks of transparency and equality. “Electoral bonds are bought generally by giant and resourceful entities and therefore the party in power will be obliged to return them in monetary terms during their rule. Also, this is advantageous to the ruling party or bigger parties. Electoral bonds are a way to legitimise illegal funding channels for elections,” he opined.

As the SC hears this matter during the next month, the journalist hopes that it upholds transparency of electoral process, especially with regard to party funding.

In the second panel, speaking of judicial independence, journalist Apurva Vishwanath with a hint of sarcasm, observed: “SC seems to have discharged its duties very efficiently this year with so many cases being disposed of, from Rafael controversy to Rahul Gandhi case (regarding his remarks on the chowkidar slogan)! The apex court spent its 40 long days on the Ayodhya dispute.

But the same court didn’t find time for issues pertaining to Kashmir. And nobody knows what actually happened to the sexual harassment case filed against CJI Ranjan Gagoi.”All these developments are going to corrode the trust people have in the judiciary, she feared.

Vakasha posed questions regarding the arbitrary transfer of judges. “Why was Justice Akil Kureshi’s appointment as CJI of the Madhya Pradesh cancelled? If he was well qualified to be the CJI of Tripura why not for MP then?” asked Vakasha, adding, the fact that there is no reasoning given for such arbitrary decisions by the collegium was discomforting. Advocate Suhrith Parthasarathy too mentioned that the collegium system for appointment of judges has been problematic throughout.

Lastly, the third panel comprising Hon’ble Justice (retired) of the HC of Karnataka, Ashok Hinchigeri, Advocate Jayna Kothari and Assistant professor of NALSAR, Sidharth Chauhan discussed the most controversial judgements, namely, the Ayodhya and the Sabarimala. If the retired Justice saw Ayodhya as purely a land title dispute, Sidharth argued that the dispute is surely more than a property issue. “It is an interesting exercise to document the behaviour and statements of judges, advocates, witnesses and nature of evidence produced for this case. Seeing it from a law and society angle, it leads us to several questions -- how did both the sides manufacture evidence? Are judges constrained by Majoritarian sentiments? Do judges arrive at a particular decision keeping in mind the probable communal violence? Further, looking at it from the political angle, the dispute has aided a political party to build its strong electoral base in the last few decades,” he explained. Even if it is seen as a property dispute, “how far do you go in history?” he asked adding that these questions rather need to be resolved at the cultural or civilisational level.

Commenting on the Sabarimala verdict, if J. Hinchigeri wishes that the SC leaves religious matters to those practising the religion in the pending review petition, Jayna Kothari welcomes the verdict adding that temple entry of women relates to gender equality.

The conference was indeed a one of its kind. The fact that it brought academicians, advocates, journalists and students of law on a single platform was another welcoming feature.",education,https://www.thehindu.com/education/al8j7k/article30449328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGEPSCR1,https://www.thehindu.com/education/scrutinising-the-house-of-justice/article30449329.ece

The ruling Left Democratic Front and the Opposition United Democratic Front that is led by the Congress, had supported the resolution demanding that the Centre rescind the Act.

126,2020/01/01,Youth Congress men carry coffin to hospital,"Youth Congress activists took out a march carrying a coffin to the district hospital here on the New Year’s day on Wednesday, in protest against the neglect towards the trauma care unit at the hospital.

The trauma care unit, although inaugurated by Minister for Health K.K. Shailaja over a year ago, has not started functioning yet.

Clash of egos between the hospital authorities and the Government Medical College doctors who work there is alleged to be the reason for the non-functioning of the unit.

Apology sought

Inaugurating the march, Youth Congress parliament committee president Boban Mattumantha demanded that Ms. Shailaja apologise to the people of Palakkad for misleading them by inaugurating a non-functional unit a year ago. Mr. Boban, quoting medical college authorities, said that the district hospital had failed assign duties for the 12 surgeons and 12 other doctors, including anaesthesiologists, and 40 nurses from the Palakkad Medical College.

The medical college is yet to have a hospital of its own, and the students and teachers of the college are dependent on the district hospital for their clinics.

Mr. Boban said the district hospital authorities were challenging the people of Palakkad for their narrow self-interests. He warned that marches carrying coffins would be taken out to the residences of the district hospital authorities if they continued to ignore people’s demand.

128,2020/01/01,Kaviyoor suicide case: court slams CBI report,"A special court here on Wednesday slammed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for its purported failure to establish the real reason for the suspected poisoning deaths of four members of a family, including two teenage sisters, in Kaviyoor in Pathanamthitta district in 2004.

Judge of the CBI Special Court K. Sanil Kumar ordered the agency to investigate further the murky incident that had generated public concern after the autopsy revealed that the elder sister had been sexually exploited repeatedly.

She was found dead with her father, a temple priest, younger sister and mother at their modest house on September 28, 2004.

Editor’s role

The case took a turn when T. P. Nandakumar, Editor, Crime magazine, entered the trial as a third party.

He alleged in court that the elder girl was the victim of a sex-for-stardom racket. He alleged that Latha Nair, an alleged procuress, had paired of the teenager with the wards of two powerful CPI(M) politicians, promising the victim a leg-up in the Malayalam film industry.

Cover-up allegation

Mr. Nandakumar argued that the deaths could be a cover-up to protect the politicians and their children.

Four back-to-back inquiries by the CBI, including the latest one, found no evidence to support his allegation that roiled Left politics briefly in 2010.

The CBI also flip-flopped on its earlier finding that sexually aberrant behaviour on the part of the father towards his elder daughter had compelled the family to enter into a suicide pact. The court had struck down the controversial finding that caused a public uproar as ‘perfunctory and ineffective.’

Reason for murder

Mr. Sanil Kumar found that the CBI could not pin down the reason for the suspected suicides. It was at a loss to explain who had sexually exploited the teenage girl. Several aspects of the case begged a logical explanation.

The judge felt that a further inquiry would perhaps help the court arrive at the truth.

The CBI had suggested that fear of being named and shamed for their association with Latha Nair, one of the accused in the infamous Kiliroor sex scandal case, might have prompted the family to end their lives.

However, the court found that the inference lacked the strength of evidence.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kaviyoor-suicide-case-court-slams-cbi-report/article30454025.ece
129,2020/01/01,Kerala joins 11 other States for ration card portability,"Ration card holders in 11 other States can now buy subsidised ration items in Kerala under an inter-State portability system.

Food Minister P. Thilothaman announced here on Wednesday that the portability system had come into effect. With this, AAY (Antyodaya Anna Yojana) and priority card holders in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Goa, Haryana, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Tripura can purchase rations from fair price shops in any of the 12 States in the grid. The beneficiaries will be identified through the biometric method using Aadhaar card. E- PoS machines used for the purpose are being updated in the whole cluster.

Subsidised grains

Priority cardholders can avail of 5 kg of subsidised grains a month at the rate of ₹3 a kg for rice and ₹2 a kg for wheat in any of the 12 States. However, kerosene, wheat flour, sugar and other grains sold through public distribution system (PDS) outlets have not been included in the inter-State portability network.

An official press note quoting the Minister said the system would help migrant workers from other States and Malayalis residing in other States to avail of ration without changing their ration card.

Portability system

The portability system is part of the One Nation, One Ration Card scheme introduced by the Central government. It is scheduled to come into full effect by June 2020, after which a ration card holder can buy subsidised grain at any fair price shops in the country.

130,2020/01/01,CM’s sops a hogwash: Chennithala,"Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has termed as “mere hogwash” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s New Year announcements related to women-friendly rest rooms in public places.

In a statement here on Wednesday, Mr. Chennithala said such announcements were nothing but devious methods of concealing the LDF government’s administrative failure. These schemes had been earlier announced in the budget and now had been revived as if these were new ones.

No expenditure

Quoting budget figures, Mr. Chennithala said the State government had earmarked ₹1,420 crore for various women-specific schemes. But not much expenditure had been incurred. Mr Chennithala made fun of the Chief Minister’s announcement that ₹37 crore would be spent on planting saplings, considering the fact that such schemes were announced earlier and there was no clarity on what was the outcome.

Nothing new

There was nothing new in the Chief Minister’s proclamation that those who did not have a ration card would be given one, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cms-sops-a-hogwash-chennithala/article30453994.ece
131,2020/01/01,SIC for putting dam-break analysis in public domain,"The State Information Commission (SIC) has stressed the need for putting the dam-break analysis prepared for the Mullaperiyar and Idukki dams in the public domain.

Information Commissioner S. Somanatha Pillai made the observation on Wednesday while disposing of a petition seeking disciplinary action against the Public Information Officer of the Water Resources Department for denying information on the dam-break analysis to an RTI activist.

The commissioner said one of the major objectives of the analysis was to assess the impact in case of a breach in the dams, so that the government and its instrumentality could prepare plans in advance and equip themselves for mitigating the damage to life and property and keeping such damage to the minimum.

The commissioner said people likely to be affected by such a possible debacle would be mentally and physically prepared for self evacuation at short notice if they had information on the issue. It would also help restrain them from encroaching on the banks of the rivers downstream and putting up structures. It was therefore highly essential in the interest of public safety that the results of the study be disseminated to the public.

A plea for getting the analysis report submitted by RTI activist D.B. Binu had been rejected by the State Public Information Officer of the Water Resources Department.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sic-for-putting-dam-break-analysis-in-public-domain/article30453958.ece
132,2020/01/01,New venture links food value to farming,"Varappetty, on the eastern fringes of Ernakulam, is a village known for its thriving tribe of vegetable farmers.

During the last days of 2019 it was witness to a novel initiative to bring together the expertise of nutritionists and farmers on a scale that will help substantially spread the cultivation of safe-to-eat vegetables. At the same time, the drive will send home the message that eating the best vegetables must also involve knowing their food value.

Named Jeevani, the pan-Kerala mission mode vegetable cultivation drive will be a 470-day programme, which saw its soft launch on New Year Day and will culminate on Vishu in 2021, said an official of the Department of Agriculture.

He said the programme involved the entire spectrum of society. Students, teachers, Kudumbashree members, people’s representatives in different local bodies and the government, religious institutions and their land.

Model gardens that would tell people about what to cultivate would come up in all villages within 15 days. These gardens would be developed with the help of nutritionists so that people got a basic idea about the need to cater to health requirements.

“Besides, the 470-day drive will also focus on traditional varieties of both tuber and leafy vegetables that are not usually cultivated on a commercial scale in the State. Involving school students in the programme will help spread the message as well as carry the tradition to the next generation,” he said.

Around a hundred schools had identified land extending between 10 and 25 cents for vegetable cultivation. These schools would set the tone of the programme, said the official, who also pointed out that more schools would come under the programme.

“Any piece of land that is lying fallow and can be brought under cultivation will be part of the programme.” He said land belonging to schools, colleges, religious institutions, libraries, public enterprises, etc., would be identified and brought under cultivation under the programme.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4wk6gr/article30453935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02tv-farmingcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/new-venture-links-food-value-to-farming/article30453930.ece

Welcoming the government's plan, KVVES leaders said here on Wednesday that they would be ready to cooperate with the gradual reduction of single-use plastics if the government gave at least six months to clear the existing stock and find other viable alternatives.

“No trader can completely resist or defy the government's intention to stop the use of single-use plastic as it is part of the environment protection initiatives.

Extension sought

What we seek now is a possible extension of the deadline fixed for clearing the existing stock,” said KVVES secretary K. Sethumadhavan.

He said the traders would be forced to consider an indefinite agitation again if the government was planning to impose fines on violators after its 15-day field-level campaign.

Metropolitan trustee of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church Joseph Mar Greogorios told The Hindu that the government move would help end the uncertainties associated with funerals. The government decision addressed part of the grievances of the Jacobites.

He said the Jacobites had approached several fora, including NHRC and the government, on the issue. There have been frequent standoffs between the two groups of the Malankara Church over the burial of the dead in different parts of the State. The number of such incidents got more media attention after the Supreme Court verdict of July 3, 2017, which handed over control of all Malankara Church parishes to the Orthodox faction and banned all parallel administration.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jacobites-hail-move/article30453898.ece

In a statement, Episcopal Synod secretary Yuhanon Mar Diascoros said the latest move was aimed at giving undue benefit to the Patriarch faction. The ordinance contradicted the essence of the Supreme Court order on the administration of churches and cemeteries.

According to him, the Orthodox Church will never raise any objections if relatives of deceased persons, irrespective of factional differences, legitimately raise a demand to the vicars of the churches where the SC court order has been implemented. “We have no objections whatsoever if the parish members wish to conduct the last rites of a deceased person by a priest of their choice outside the church. But for burying a dead body in a cemetery under the Orthodox Church, they should definitely get the consent of the vicar in-charge concerned,” asserted the Metropolitan.

136,2020/01/01,Rush continues at Sabarimala,"Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple continued to witness heavy rush as devotees from different parts of south India undertook their pilgrimage to the temple. Pilgrims had to wait for hours together inside the thickly packed iron barricades on the New Year day on Wednesday to reach the temple premises.

The queue of pilgrims extended up to Sabaripeedhom on the trekking path, 2.5 km away from Sannidhanam, in the morning.

A majority of the pilgrims were from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka.

Other routes

The flow of pilgrims to Sannidhanam through the Karimala and Pullumedu routes too has gone up.

The Ayyappa Seva Sanghom camps at Karimala and Valiyanavattom were providing free food and medicated drinking water to the pilgrims.

TDB sources told The Hindu that the revenue collection at Sabarimala during the just-concluded Mandalam pilgrim season was ₹163 crore.

30 lakh pilgrims

As per the digital head count registered at the police aid-post at Sabarimala, 30,59,000 pilgrims had visited the Ayyappa temple during the 41-day Mandalam festival season.

The Minister was addressing an official meeting at the State capital on Wednesday to review the arrangements being made by various government departments and the Travancore Devaswom Board for the smooth conduct of this year’s Makaravilakku festival at Sabarimala.

Mr. Surendran said bio-toilets would be installed at places where regulation of vehicular traffic was required during the rush days of the pilgrim season.

Safety of pilgrims

The Minister said utmost care should be taken to ensure the safety of pilgrims. Sufficient precautionary measures should be ensured where pilgrims congregate in large numbers for the Makaravilakku darshan.

Three specially prepared emergency medical ambulances should be kept ready at Sabarimala Sannidhanam for shifting people to Pampa in the event of an emergency.

The government would also explore the possibility of facilitating air ambulance service at Sabarimala during the Makaravilakku festival, he said.

He said the authorities should take necessary steps to make the pilgrims, especially the youth, properly aware of the health risk involved in undertaking a fast climb of the steep Neelimala and Appachimedu hills as part of their pilgrimage, against the backdrop of 20 cardiac casualties during the just-concluded 41-day Mandalam pilgrim season.

Mr. Surendran said the Health Department would keep 26 ambulances ready at Pampa, Nilackal and various other transit points during the Makaravilakku festival.

KSRTC service

Mr. Surendran said the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation would increase the number of Corporation employees on deputation at Pampa and Nilackal during the Makaravilakku festival.

138,2020/01/01,Curriculum revision on the cards,"The Higher Education Department is set to revise the curriculum of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in line with the learning outcome-based model curriculum that has been proposed by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

The direction to expedite steps in this regard was issued by Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel during deliberations that were held with the representatives of teachers organisations.

Mr. Jaleel exhorted the meeting to study the possibility of emulating the decision adopted by the A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University to do away with the system of fixing minimum marks for internal assessment in the other universities.

During the discussions, he raised caution against the possible repercussions that the provisions of the proposed National Education Policy could have on the higher education sector of the State. The draft document contained recommendations to scrap the existing affiliation system, discontinue M.Phil. and two-year B.Ed. programmes, and close down various institutions, including technological, health, agricultural and law universities.

In light of the scenario, the Minister urged teachers organisations and academicians to work towards evolving an alternative framework that would enable the State to mitigate the consequences of the Centre’s policy.

The Minister said that steps were afoot to ensure that the classes of undergraduate and postgraduate courses commenced on June 1 from the next academic year onwards. As part of steps aimed at achieving the goal, the results of the final year undergraduate and postgraduate examinations will be published on April 30 and May 31 respectively.

The meeting also deliberated on implementing the split vacation system that has been mooted by the Kerala State Higher Education Council. The proposal involved replacing the present two-month annual vacation pattern from April to May with a split vacation pattern to schedule vacation for November and May.

139,2020/01/01,Second Loka Kerala Sabha begins,"Lauding the State government for constituting the Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS), Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has said that it held immense potential in facilitating greater participation of Non-Resident Keralites (NoRKs) in the development of the State.

Formally inaugurating the second LKS summit at the Nishagandhi auditorium in the presence of several NoRK delegates here on Wednesday, the Governor said that the assembly recognised the constructive role of the Malayali diaspora through democratic decisions.

He pointed out that the LKS had moved ahead with an action plan since its first meeting in January 2018.

Common platform

“The constitution of the LKS as a common platform for the cultural, socio-political and economic integration of NoRKs with the State deserves appreciation. The government had taken steps to channelise the Pravasi remittances for the general good of people, including non-resident citizens,” Mr. Khan said.

The Governor urged the Sabha to evolve a mechanism to help the State make relevant suggestions to the Central government in matters relating to legal, professional and human rights issues faced by NoRKs abroad, so that the Ministry of External Affairs could make more effective interventions.

Vital link

Delivering the presidential address, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that the LKS could serve as a vital link to utilise the expertise of scientists, technocrats, academicians, economists and other highly skilled workers abroad for the State’s progress.

In this manner, the platform has been created with a broad vision of enabling the Malayali diaspora to become active partners in the State’s growth story and go beyond the role they have played so far through foreign remittances, he said.

Mr. Vijayan added that the second edition of the LKS would deliberate upon legislation that would create a legal and institutional framework for the summit.

Speaking on the occasion, Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan said the objectives of the LKS went beyond being an investors’ meet. The platform enabled NoKRs from across the world to come together and share their unique experiences, he said.

He added that the summit was able to survive aspersions that were cast by certain quarters to create an image of positivity and unity.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/81xm8n/article30453967.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV02LOKASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-lauds-loka-kerala-sabha/article30453100.ece
140,2020/01/01,TDB open to Presidential visit,"Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) president N. Vasu has expressed the hope that President Ramnath Kovind will be visiting Sabarimala on January 6.

Mr. Vasu was addressing a Meet-the-Press programme at the Pathanamthitta Press Club on Wednesday afternoon. However, no final decision had been taken in this regard, he said.

Mr. Vasu said the Rashtrapati Bhavan had informed the State government that the President would be visiting Kerala and Lakshadweep between January 5 and 9 and no other official communication had been received in this regard as on Wednesday evening.

In a message sent to the State government, the Rashtrapathi Bhavan expressed the President’s wish to visit the temples at Guruvayur and Sabarimala as he was expected to reach Kochi en route to Lakshadweep on January 5, the TDB chief said.

He said both Nilackal and Paandithavalom had helicopter landing space. Considering the health condition of the President, travelling all the way from Nilackal to Sabarimala by road would be difficult, Mr. Vasu said.

He said the concrete slab atop the huge water tank at Paandithavalom had been cast with adequate strength, envisaging facility for emergency landing of helicopters for evacuation of people in the event of a stampede or the like alarming situation.

Mr. Vasu said the TDB would be greatly privileged to welcome the President at Sabarimala. He said, earlier, the authorities had constructed a helipad at Saramkuthi to provide helicopter landing facility for former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi four decades ago.

But, the plan was abandoned following strong opposition against the move from certain quarters, he said.

However, the TDB saw no possibility of opposition towards the President’s visit in the prevailing political situation, he said. “The times have changed a lot and so is the case of certain tradition and practices too at Sabarimala. Though no motorised carriages are supposedly permitted to the Sannidhanam, two emergency ambulances have been taken to the holy hillock,’’ Mr. Vasu said.

Collector clarifies

Meanwhile, District Collector P.B. Noohu said he had directed the Public Works Department (Buildings division) and the TDB to verify the strength of the concrete slab atop the water tank at Paandithavalom that had been identified as a helicopter landing facility.

141,2020/01/01,First chargesheet filed in Koodathayi murder case,"The special investigation team (SIT) probing the Koodathayi serial murders submitted the chargesheet in the murder of Roy Thomas before the Thamarassery Judicial First Class Magistrate's Court II in Kozhikode district on Wednesday.

The chargesheet, running into 1,800 pages, was the first of six sensational cases in which the prime accused Jolly Joseph allegedly eliminated two branches of the Ponnamattom ancestral family after giving them cyanide-laced food or drink over a period of 14 years.

The 47-year-old was named the first accused in the murder of her former husband Roy on September 30, 2011. Along with Jolly, the chargesheet named M.S. Mathew, aka Shaji, 44, and Prajikumar, 44, who allegedly helped Jolly in getting the cyanide and a former Communist Party of India (Marxist) functionary K. Manoj, 41, who helped to forge documents.

Jolly's mother-in-law Annamma Thomas; her father-in-law Tom Thomas, a retired Education Department officer; Sily, wife of Shaju Zacharias, Jolly’s second husband; Sily's two-year-old daughter Alphine; and Annamma’s brother-in-law Mathew Manjadiyil were the other victims.

Crime Branch Superintendent of Police K.G. Simon said the accused were charged under Sections 302 (murder), 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 465 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security and will), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document), 110 (punishment for abetment if person abetted does act with different intention from that of abettor), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 (2) [penalty for unlawful importation] of the Poison Act.

142,2020/01/01,Suchitwa Sagaram runs out of steam,"Suchitwa Sagaram, Kerala’s celebrated clean sea mission that garnered much global attention, has run out of steam due to the lack of funds.

The fishers, who brought back truckloads of plastic waste from the sea after the project's ambitious take off in 2017, say their enthusiasm has fizzled out due to many factors, including government apathy.

Moreover, the women employed at the collection point and the shredding unit complain of delayed wages, an issue they have been facing for sometime now. “It takes some effort to detangle the plastic waste from our nets, wash it and then collect it in the bags. Though the Minister promised an incentive based on the volume of waste we bring back, there has been no follow-up. We are getting very poor catch these days and we are not very keen on saving environment when our own survival is at stake,” says Wilson, fishermen.

Visible dip

Peter Mathias, president, All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators Association, says there is a visible dip in the quantity of plastic each trawler brings back nowadays and it will be difficult to keep the project afloat without government intervention.

“Only trawlers can efficiently sweep the sea floor and scoop up huge amounts of waste while fishing. But with the government introducing an exorbitant raise in the registration, deposit and annual licence fee in the mechanised sector, it has created a lot of resentment among the fishers. We were the ones who conceived the project, named it and volunteered to bring back the waste. In the initial days we used to bring double the quantity and I feel we can still make it a success with government support,” he says.

No collection points

Another challenge faced by the authorities is the management of plastic accumulation at harbours that do not have Suchiwa Sagaram collection points. “Proper collection and transport, especially from harbours such as Azheekkal, is a major challenge and usually it’s done only after repeated appeals,” he adds.

The project had made headlines again when it provided 500 kg plastic granules for the construction of Keralapuram-Kovilmukku road. But the employees attached to the project say they have been struggling due to the erratic pattern in the disbursal of wages.

“The women employed at the Neendakara shredding unit received their wages for five months only a day before Christmas and their salary is still pending. Though we have employed women from fisher families for Suchitwa Sagaram, there is no specific fund allocated for the project,” says an official from Harbour Engineering Department.

No support

Last year, a London-based NGO had visited Neendakara to study the project and extended their support for the initiative.

“We were told that the people from the NGO had offered to take care of our salaries and we should wait for that. But there has been no change in our condition even after several months,” says an employee.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bb3ywn/article30456890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02tvko-PlasticShreddingunit,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/suchitwa-sagaram-runs-out-of-steam/article30452603.ece

Addressing the gathering at the Akhila Kerala Nair Prathinidhi Sammelan as part of the 143nd Mannam Jayanthi celebrations at Perunna, NSS General Secretary G. Sukumaran Nair said that it was imperative for the community members to judiciously use the policy and find the right choice among the political fronts.

“As to how we should find the right distance, the NSS members have demonstrated it during the recent Parliamentary election,’’ noted Mr. Nair, in an apparent reference to the massive drubbing of the Left Democratic Front in the last general election.

Regarding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Mr. Nair said the community organisation was yet to take a specific stance on the issue. “We chose to stay away from a meeting convened by the Chief Minister to discuss the issue but the public clearly knows our position on this,’’ he said.

Regarding the Sabarimala issue, he said, “We have already filed five affidavits and plan to file four more affidavits soon. All our moves in the apex court will be made through senior Counsel K. Parasaran,’’ he added.

On the occasion, the organisation also registered its strong protest against the State government for the delay in implementing the 10% reservation for the economically backward among the general category in government jobs and education and its move to implement reservation quota for the SC/ST and OBC categories in streams 2 and 3 of the Kerala Administrative Service.

145,2020/01/01,Second power house may come up in Idukki,"A second power house is in the offing in Idukki to increase the installed capacity of the Moolamattom Power House and thereby reducing power purchase for peak hour consumption.

A senior official of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) told The Hindu on Wednesday that it had to meet high cost by purchasing power through power-trading from outside sources. By increasing the installed capacity of the power house, dependence on outside sources during peak hours could be reduced.

The Idukki reservoir has been chosen for a second power house taking into consideration the high storage capacity. The power house has an installed capacity of 780 mw and the peak hour demand could be met.

The KSEB at present has to bear a high expense by purchasing power during peak hours. The State is having more domestic consumers and it is one reason for the high consumption during peak hours, especially in the evening and morning. The Idukki dam is mainly reserved for meeting the power demands during the summer season. It could be used for meeting the peak hour consumption by increasing the installed capacity.

The official said that a detailed project report (DPR) would be submitted soon. The official said the flood-like situation had also been taken into consideration for the proposal of a second power station. The Idukki dam shutters had to be opened in 2018 August floods resulting in large-scale devastation on the downstream area.

In addition, the KSEB had to release water which otherwise could have been utilised for power generation. The increased installed capacity will help in energy reserve and meeting a flood-like situation too, the official said.

The possibility of similar situation such as the opening of shutters could be limited by diverting the water for power production. Moreover, the age-old equipment at the power station which passed 40 years also made the need of new equipment a necessity, said the official.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/second-power-house-may-come-up-in-idukki/article30452137.ece

As per the ordinance, members of either factions could use graveyard in their parish after conducting the last rites by a priest of their choice outside the church.

This follows the disputes between the two factions over burying bodies. (The Orthodox faction that got a Supreme Court order in its favour on managing churches had come face to face at various places).

148,2020/01/01,Pinarayi should have sought legal advice: Prasad,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should have sought better legal advice while making the Assembly pass resolutions against legislation such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Union Minister for Law and Justice Ravisankar Prasad has said.

Mr. Prasad told reporters here on Tuesday that if other States decide not to abide by the laws passed by Kerala, including the ones for handing over criminals arrested within their ambit, it would lead to lawlessness.

Centre’s stand

The Centre respects dissent, but not violence and mayhem in the name of the Act. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and others in government are open to criticism, but would not allow to break the nation, Mr. Prasad said and added that organisations such as the Popular Front of India have a role in the agitations.

Citing the protests in Mumbai, with the participation of film personalities, he said they were raising slogans for ‘azadi’ (freedom).

They should contest and defeat the BJP in elections, he said, and clarified that Mr. Modi had reiterated that the government had not taken a call on the National Register for Citizens so far.

Disinformation

Mr. Ravisankar, who described the Act as constitutional and legal, accused vested interests of launching a disinformation campaign with devious political intent. He accused the Congress of adopting double standards on the issue.

Mr. Modi was implementing only what the previous United Progressive Alliance regimes had initiated.

It was unfortunate that the Congress, despite administering the country for long, has become part of the campaign.

“The Congress and the family have not yet reconciled to Mr. Modi’s election as Prime Minister,” he said.

Flays historian

He condemned the protests against Governor Arif Mohammad Khan at the Indian History Congress in Kannur and said those who accuse the Centre of curbing dissent are unwilling to heed contrarian views.

Historian Irfan Habib had made a public call against voting for Mr. Modi in 2014. If Mr. Habib had a disagreement on what Mr. Khan said, he could have taken it up later in his speech, Mr. Prasad said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/16hd6r/article30448861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TVCITIZENSHIPAMENDMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pinarayi-should-have-sought-legal-advice-prasad/article30448862.ece
149,2020/01/01,Finalise application for renewal of voter list: CEO,"Chief Electoral Officer Teeka Ram Meena has instructed tahsildars to finalise the applications received so far in connection with the 2020 renewal of voter list.

He was speaking at a meeting at the collectorate here on Tuesday. Requests for new names, corrections, and deletions in the voter list should be field-tested by the booth level officers (BLOs) and addressed in a timely manner. He also said that the parties should be given notice on removal of names from the current voter list. He reviewed the activities of BLOs, assessing the number of pending applications.

Strict action will be taken against BLOs who fall short on matters such as field-level inspections. He instructed officials to hand over the list of such persons. Mr. Meena said the current method of disposing of applications at the final stage should be avoided.

Meanwhile, a special voter renewal campaign is being organised to ensure that no eligible person is excluded from the voter list.

Mr. Meena said the Comprehensive Draft Voter List was published on December 16. Anyone with complaints can submit them till January 15. Complaints will be published by January 27, and a supplementary list will be brought out on February 4. The final ballot will be released on February 7. Besides, steps will be taken to include those who turn 18 as on January 1, 2020.

He suggested that special emphasis be placed on the issue when it comes to differently abled, members of scheduled castes and tribes, and transgender people. The draft voter list will be available at taluk and village offices for BLOs.

On the occasion of New Year, Parthiban announced his next project with a poster. Amongst the first few of its kind in the world, Iravin Nizhal will be a single-shot feature. No other details regarding the project have been revealed yet. However, it is already known that Parthiban will also play the leading role.

If the industry grapevine is anything to go by, the movie will go on the floors early next year.

Parthiban’s last directorial venture was the critically acclaimed Tamil thriller Oththa Seruppu Size 7, in which he featured as the only character in the film’s frame.

On the acting front, Parthiban was recently signed to play a pivotal role in Mani Ratnam’s upcoming Tamil magnum opus Ponniyin Selvan.

152,2020/01/01,How’s Kollywood business looking like in 2020?,"Kollywood’s business will undergo a major shift in the new decade. This comes at a time when the market is at an all-time low, thanks to the failure of recent movies — some of which, featuring big stars, failed to draw audiences in Tamil Nadu. Producers and distributors are at loggerheads due to several issues; spiralling production costs, stars’ remunerations and return on investment rates. In fact, some leading financiers have stopped funding new films until they recover “bad loans”.

Exhibitors, on the other hand, are concerned about the market since big-ticket films are unable to survive the opening weekend. A fraction of them has put the blame on producers, who have been selling the digital rights to OTT platforms in a month’s time. Theatre owners too are burdened by the 8% Local Body Entertainment Tax, making the Tamil film industry the highest tax payer. About the business, actor Vishnu Vishal says, “2020 is going to make a difference. I’m expecting more transparency in ticketing as business will get totally computerised.”

Here we look at five major changes that will take place in the New Year.

Star power

The audience prefers watching star-driven movies and Kollywood’s star system is here to stay. In fact, it will only get stronger. There needs to be some sort of restructure in terms of stars’ salaries for a movie to be profitable at the box office. “The trade will not make profits if stars don’t opt for a profit-sharing basis. In today’s scenario, a star’s remuneration is close to 50-60% of the total cost of a movie, which is sad. Then what about the distributor share after all taxes? My New Year resolution is to not produce Tamil movies any more,” says producer Mukesh Mehta.

Only air inside

Recently, a producer sold the Hindi dubbing rights of a film to a distributor in Mumbai for a whopping ₹8 crore. The agent, who paid a token of advance, backed out a day before the film’s release. The situation isn’t different in the overseas market, where buyers had a lot to lose. It is quite alarming because there are no takers for Hindi and overseas rights for Tamil movies slated to release in the first quarter of 2020. A leading overseas agent says, “Producers cannot charge a bomb just because one or two movies made money here. We are planning to work on a commission basis from this year.”

The role of multiplex

Multiplexes will call the shots, just like the previous year. National multiplex players have control over the lucrative markets of the three Cs — Chennai, Chengalpet and Coimbatore — which bring almost 60% of total revenue from Tamil Nadu theatricals. The single screens, which were once the backbone of Tamil films, have either shut down or have been forced to upgrade. “Audiences in Tamil Nadu are growing at a rapid rate, and they want to upgrade their cinema-viewing experiences. This type of audience is only going to increase in 2020,” says a spokesperson for a leading multiplex in the city.

OTT is the future

Producers are now in a rush to release their movies on OTT platforms, as early as possible. With the recently-released web series Queen becoming a hit, there will be more original content in the online space. Producer SR Prabhu released his Kaithi within days after its theatrical release. About the trend, Prabhu says, “There is going to be a surge of original content online, which will result in more web series in Tamil. The number might even surpass feature films in the next couple of years.”

Kuala Lumpur-based Dr Sunita Kumar, who is the founder of Let’s OTT website, says, “What the Tamil industry has achieved in the OTT space is just the tip of the iceberg. There is definitely a global audience for online content, which was evident when people watched Asuran and Oththa Seruppu.”

Change in formula

Tamil cinema will see a change in the way commercial movies are packaged. Vijay in Master and Ajith in the upcoming Valimai point toward that direction. The number of songs has also come down in movies since stars these days prefer montage songs. Unlike previous years, there will be more collaboration in 2020. Says Prabhu, “Take my word... there will be more association between actors, producers and directors in various industries. I am sure that the studio model will take over.”

Filmmakers will now focus on telling stories that have global connections. Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, said that the next 100 million subscriber growth for the streaming platform will come from India. The bottomline is, Kollywood must decide whether it needs to upgrade and update or face the music.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/y7ypng/article30451816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VJ64-FINAL-online-poster-ENGLISHjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-commerce-of-kollywood/article30451817.ece
153,2020/01/01,‘Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness’ shall introduce new characters in MCU,"Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has teased that the sequel to Doctor Strange will introduce new characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

The sequel, titled Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness, will bring back Benedict Cumberbatch as the Sorcerer Supreme.

Scott Derrickson, who helmed the 2016 film, is also returning for the sequel.

During a recent Q&A at the New York Film Academy, Feige said the introduction of the new, unexpected characters will come as a surprise to the fans.

“Sometimes you’re choosing title hero, you’re choosing which main character or main team you want to bring to the screen and oftentimes, it’s as you’re making and developing the movie — ‘Who will come into it? Who will fit into it?’” he said.

“The next Doctor Strange film, for instance, features some new MCU characters that will be making their debut in that movie. You won’t expect or won’t guess who it is but we found a cool way to make it work because we want to make a particular type of movie there and there was a character we always wanted to do something with who will fit really well there,” he added.

Feige also said that the sequel will not be a horror film but will certainly have some scary and edge-of-the-seat sequences.

“I wouldn’t necessarily say that’s a horror film, but it is, as Scott Derrickson, our director, has pitched it, a big MCU film with scary sequences in it,” he said.

He added that the movie will draw inspiration from some of the classics of the 1980s, such as Steven Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, among others.

“When I was a kid in the ‘80s, Spielberg did an amazing job. There are horrifying sequences in ‘Raiders (of the Lost Ark’) that I would, as a little kid, (cover my eyes) when their faces melted. Or ‘Temple of Doom’, of course, or ‘Gremlins’ or ‘Poltergeist’. These are the movies that invented the PG-13 rating, by the way. They were PG and they were like, ‘We need another (rating).’ But that’s fun, it’s fun to be scared in that way and not a horrific, torturous way, but in a way that is legitimately scary because Scott Derrickson’s quite good at that. But scary in the service of an exhilarating emotion,” Feige said.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness will also feature Elizabeth Olsen, who will reprise her MCU role of Scarlet Witch. She will join the movie following the events of her Disney Plus series WandaVision.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/okswdg/article30451333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dr,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-shall-introduce-new-characters-in-mcu/article30451334.ece
154,2020/01/01,Greta Gerwig working on a musical involving tap dancing,"Actor-director Greta Gerwig has a next project planned post Little Women and it is a musical.

The filmmaker’s latest release, the modern retelling of Louisa May Alcott’s classic novel, opened well at the box office along with overwhelming reviews.

But Gerwig is tight-lipped on the details of her forthcoming musical.

“One thing I feel that the world is really missing right now is tap dancing. I’m just going to say that,” she said on Variety’s ‘The Big Ticket’ podcast.

Gerwig is set to return to acting in a production of Anton Chekhov’s Three Sisters with actor Oscar Isaac at the New York Theatre Workshop.

The director is also co-writing a script with partner and frequent collaborator Noah Baumbach for a live-action Barbie movie starring actor Margot Robbie.

155,2020/01/01,"‘Darbar’, ‘Master’, ‘Valimai’, ‘Indian 2’: Ten Tamil films to look forward in 2020","An exciting 2020 awaits Kollywood, as a series of star films with biggies like Rajinikanth, Vijay, Kamal Haasan and Ajith are set to hit the marquee, while a couple of other interesting projects also catch the eye. Here’s what Tamil movie fans can look forward to:

Darbar

Rajinikanth playing a cop (a bad one at that) after decades, a proven veteran like Suniel Shetty as the baddie, an experienced big-budget director like Murugadoss at the helm, and Anirudh in peak form hoping to repeat his Petta success: what’s not to like about this line-up? In a year that once again heralds the entry of the Superstar into politics, the film will be keenly watched by all quarters... even though for now, it masquerades as a harmless commercial film. But come Pongal season, Darbar could find itself in the darbar.

Master

Could Vijay’s decision to work with the most exciting young director in Kollywood today be a watershed moment in his career? Granted, he’s delivered a hattrick of hits with the likes of Mersal, Sarkar and Bigil in recent years, and yet, deciding to change track and do a film with Lokesh Kanagaraj speaks volumes about an actor on whom the political spotlight always dominates pre-release proceedings. If Kaithi is anything to go by, Kanagaraj can marry commercial sensibilities and a new-age narrative with ease, and in the Vijay-Vijay Sethupathi showdown, he’s got possibly, a casting coup for the ages.

Valimai

Ajith has shown a penchant to work with filmmakers and producers he’s comfortable with, and reuniting with his Nerkonda Paarvaiteam — with an original script this time — comes as no surprise. Little has been revealed about this project, except that it will see the actor play a cop after Yennai Arindhaal and Boney Kapoor revealing that he’ll ensure to showcase Ajith’s ‘passion for speed’, which points towards a much-hyped superbike chase/sequence.

D40

That Karthik Subbaraj wanted Al Pacino or Robert De Niro to play the antagonist in this film is astonishing insight into the five-film-old director’s vision. He finally had to settle for Games of Thrones star James Cosmo, but make no mistake about it, this is a filmmaker with real and tangible Hollywood aspirations.

Shot in London, this touted gangster drama has all the trappings of an epic franchise to come, if successful — and in Dhanush and Subbaraj, two men, whom the rest of the film world have an envious eye on constantly.

Cobra

Vikram needs a hit. His fans want him to have a hit. We, the public, are desperate to give him a hit. Will 2020 finally be the year? To be fair, the actor is making the right choice on paper — picking a young director, Ajay Gnanamuthu. His delayed Gautham Menon movie Dhruva Natchathiram could also see a release this year.

Soorarai Pottru

Suriya has a knack of selecting interesting scripts, and his 2020’s pick has him playing a role reportedly based on the life of Air Deccan founder GR Gopinath. In Soorarai Pottru, he will play Maara who is ‘an ordinary man with extraordinary dreams’, going by a tagline. Suriya teams up with director Sudha Kongara, who gave us the gripping sports dramaIrudhi Suttru earlier, in this film that has music by GV Prakash. Fans of Suriya are waiting for Pongal, for a teaser is expected to release on that date.

Indian 2

The ‘Indian thatha’ is back to take on the system. Kamal Haasan and Shankar team up after a long time to do a second innings of a character we all loved, way back in 1996. With Kamal showing political intentions, it remains to be seen if he’d use this illustrious character to further his cause.

Thalaivar 168

Who wouldn’t like to see Rajinikanth in a big, fat family drama? A film that has an ensemble star cast that includes Keerthy Suresh, Khushbu and Meena, it will see Rajinikanth teaming up for the first time with director Siva, who is fresh off the success of Ajith’s Viswasam.

Mafia

The last decade has been about young filmmakers making waves in Tamil cinema, and one among them is Dhuruvangal Pathinaaru filmmaker Karthick Naren. His Naragasooran is yet to see the light of the day, but the director has pinned hopes this year on his action thriller flick, Mafia. The trailer gives equal prominence to both Arun Vijay and Prasanna.

And, the madcap personality that he is, the radio jockey-turned-actor is doing an ‘Amman film’ with Nayanthara.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fyhttd/article30450824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kolly,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/darbar-master-valimai-indian-2-ten-tamil-films-to-look-forward-in-2020/article30450830.ece

I want to see more new writers in Telugu cinema and we need to evolve our writing. There’s a dearth of writers, perhaps that’s one of the reasons we don’t have enough fresh content. I’ve been attending NFDC’s (National Film Development Corporation) Film Bazaar the last few years and Telugu cinema rarely gets discussed there. Our cinema is spoken about when the topic is about big budgets and box office thanks to S S Rajamouli’s Baahubali, but we are yet to make a mark in national and international forums for critically acclaimed films. In the 2020s, I hope to make at least one film that will be appreciated in the international circuits.

I also wish that new and emerging actors, especially those coming from a film family, take up diverse content. Chiranjeevi garu did a variety of films and that made him a superstar. I see a trend of young actors wanting to do those mass masala films in the initial stage itself. When our emerging and established actors are open to diverse content, Telugu cinema will benefit.

Sashi Kiran Tikka

He co-wrote and directed Goodachari (2018) and is now working on Adivi Sesh-starrer Telugu-Hindi film Major, inspired by the life of major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, a martyr of the 26/11 attacks.

Sashi Kiran Tikka | Photo Credit: By arrangement

I’ve always believed in content-driven cinema. But I observed this significant shift among the audience, in the last two to three years. Earlier there were fewer opportunities for filmmakers who wanted to tell a story in a more rooted manner. There was a view that such narrative styles would be more appropriate for Malayalam or Tamil cinema. All that’s changing now. New-age producers are game to back new content and the old school producers are also opening up to ideas. It’s easier to do a film like Goodachari or Major today, deviating from the typical song and dance routine, as compared to a decade ago. I like to use music as montages or for situations where you push the story forward through lyrics. I am passionate about cinema, and apart from directing, I am also eager to edit, produce and try other crafts and help other aspiring filmmakers to tell their stories.

Gowtam Tinnanuri

He wrote and directed the coming-of-age romance Malli Raava (2017) and the sports-relationship drama Jersey (2019), and is currently remaking Jersey in Hindi with Shahid Kapoor.

Gowtam Tinnanuri | Photo Credit: By arrangement

The biggest change in the last decade, I think, has been the emergence of OTT platforms. There’s been a shift in the viewing experience, with people viewing a lot more content on smaller screens. I love the experience of watching a film in a theatre. Hollywood has been making superhero spectacles that elevate the theatrical experience. And we have had Baahubali. It’s tough for us to make those larger-than-life films with the budgets we have. We need to adapt technology to achieve that kind of result at a lower cost. I want to learn new technology and see how it can help my filmmaking process. Each time there’s a threat from a new medium, cinema has evolved and taken a new direction. The evolution in the 2020s will be significant. After the Jersey Hindi remake, I want to make a Telugu film. I enjoy the process of writing and my Telugu lines being spoken by actors.

157,2020/01/01,Rao Ramesh is basking in the response he’s been getting for ‘Prathi Roju Pandage’,"Actor Rao Ramesh has an immense fan following, be it in the cities or in rural areas. Directors specifically write roles and lines for him and when he gets into the act, there is no stopping him. He has been getting noticed for his roles in recent years and the response he is getting for his performance in the recent Telugu film Prathi Roju Pandage is phenomenal.

The moment he appears on screen, the crowds especially in the single screen theatres, scream, whistle and clap; if this isn’t stardom then what is? Most of our films are hero-centric, and the supporting cast gets very little to do. Very rarely such stories come up where character artistes can have a field day.

For Rao Ramesh, did a chance like Prathi Roju Pandage come after a decade? The actor says, “I am getting this [opportunity] after 100 films. When [director] Maruthi approached me, he narrated a few scenes and said the viewers will talk about Sathamanam Bhavati but once the story gathers steam, they will forget it.”

Rao Ramesh’s dialogue rendition makes it feel like the lines are his own. He says, “Dialogues are given to me only at the location and I improvise it a little, the rest is entirely to the director’s credit. Maruthi gave me so much freedom that the fluidity in my body language and facial expressions were noticed and appreciated by the audience. I told the unit I don’t want to wear spectacles because expressions won’t be seen much, but I had to wear it. Ikkada kallajodu dhati expressions kanapadali (the expressions should be visible beyond the glasses) and I pulled it off. Maruthi doesn’t command an artiste, he gives you freedom without any restrictions. At the same time I don’t misuse the freedom.”

The chosen one

Be it RX100, Oh! Baby or Majili, Rao Ramesh showed his dexterity and the directors who have written it believed that there is no alternative to the slot he has been given. The actor is also grateful to Sai Dharam Tej for accepting to do Prathi Roju Pandage, and mentions that not every hero who is going through a lean phase would accept such a script. The strategy paid off and the film is giving rich dividends to all those who believed in it.

Rao Ramesh avers that he is nothing without a writer or a director. A few film he has acted in have not been impactful. One of the recent disappointments for him was in F2. In big budget films with a huge star cast, the scope for the supporting cast is limited. So it is imperative they put their best foot forward. “I wish all our Telugu artistes get more opportunities in our films. Though talent has no boundaries, we should see that our artistes don’t fade away.”

All for entertainment

This generation doesn’t know much about Rao Ramesh’s father, the late Rao Gopala Rao who was a great talent but his body language was limited; but Rao Ramesh uses it to his maximum. “I try and balance positive and negative character traits given to me. Sarcasm always works in my case. I have also realised that irrespective of the hard work you put in, it is entertaining scripts that people look forward to. Sad stories have no takers.

158,2020/01/01,Private Equity investments in India surge to all time high but Tamil Nadu sees a drop,"Though Private Equity investments in India surged to an all time high of $37 billion in 2019, Tamil Nadu has seen a significant drop from last year.

Tamil Nadu attracted Private Equity (PE) and Venture Capital (VC) investments to the tune of $1,531 million across 47 deals for the year 2019. In value terms, there was a drop of 34.57% when compared to last year. In 2018, the State saw investments of over $2,340 million across 64 deals.

Data collated (as on December 29) by Venture Intelligence, a research firm focused on private company financials, transactions and their valuations shows that in 2019, the State saw 14 angel investment deals, when compared to 19 deals the previous year.

Arun Natarajan, founder and managing director,Venture Intelligence, pointed out that in terms of PE-VC investments, the value figures for 2019 and 2018 are quite comparable -- but for the outlier deal of almost $1 billion in Star Health Insurance that took place last year. “Chennai and the rest of Tamil Nadu-based companies continue to attract significant attention from PE-VC investors -- especially in sectors like financial services, enterprise software (including SaaS) and healthcare,” he said.

According to Mr. Natarajan, in a scenario where investors are likely to be more demanding on profitability metrics, companies from the State -- known for their strong business models, frugality and financial savvy -- can be expected to stand out even more prominently.

Overall, PE investments in India rose to their highest ever figure of $37 billion in 2019 across 861 transactions (the data includes VC investments, but excludes PE investments in real estate).

Riding on the back of large ticket infrastructure sector deals, PE investments in 2019 edged past the previous high of $36 billion (across 937 investments) in 2018. This year witnessed 74 PE investments worth $100 million or more (accounting for 74% of the total investment value during the period). Of these, 40 were larger than $200 million each (with 5 investments over $1 billion), Venture Intelligence data shows.

Mr. Natarajan said that the fact that the PE investment tally of 2019 outdid the previous high of 2018 -- despite uncertainties on the economic, political and global trade fronts -- is very encouraging.”

“The sheer diversity of investors that are now actively investing in India – by geography [including North America, Asia and Middle East] as well as sector preferences -- provides scope for optimism that the momentum will be maintained into the new year,” he noted.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hler4c/article30451441.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01JANTH-MONEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/private-equity-investments-in-india-surge-to-all-time-high-but-tamil-nadu-sees-a-drop/article30451442.ece
159,2020/01/01,"Allow Sri Lankan Tamil refugees to return if they want to, says Vaiko","MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Wednesday said he had a difference of opinion on the issue of granting dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in India. He contended that citizenship could be granted to those who wanted to stay back and in the case of others steps, should be taken to ensure their return to their native soil.

“If they feel that they want to live in the land [Sri Lanka] in which they lived for hundreds of years they should be allowed to go back,” he said during his routine New Year interaction with media persons.

Asked about the opinion that if ethnic Tamils were not allowed to return to their land, their population in Sri Lanka would come down drastically, Mr Vaiko reiterated he was in favour of sending them to their country. “But those who want to live in India because they have lived here for so many years, they should be granted citizenship,” he said.

Recalling the resolution adopted by Germany and the US Senate describing the killing of Armenians as “genocide” Mr. Vaiko said Sri Lankan Tamils would also get justice one day and he had already raised the issue in Brussels.

“Sinhalese settled in Tamil areas should be evacuated to pave way for the return of Tamils. Refugees all over the world always have the aspiration to return to their own soil. Sri Lankan Tamils, even though living here, will have the desire to return and we should not come in their way. But it may not happen now since the country is ruled by Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Already Hindu temples have been destroyed to build Buddhist temples,” he said.

Asked why the BJP government that had included the Christians, had excluded the Muslims in Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Mr. Vaiko said the Act was shaped by the RSS’ hatred for the Muslims since the days of Partition. He felt that it was not easy to abrogate the CAA since it was enacted by a two-thirds majority in Parliament even though political parties that had supported it now had reservations about it.

“It is a fascist government. Even during the Emergency, Indira Gandhi did not seek to implement anything in such a hurry. The Centre is implementing its hidden agendas openly to divert the people’s attention from unemployment, the economic crisis and poor growth of the GDP,” he alleged.

Mr. Vaiko, who moved a private bill in Parliament against the prevalence of the Concurrent List, said that if the government wanted to retain it, it should transfer residuary powers to the States. “Otherwise we should have only the Central and State Lists,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xdlulr/article30451286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01JANTH-VAIKO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/allow-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-to-return-if-they-want-to-says-vaiko/article30451287.ece
160,2020/01/01,"At Tiruvallur government schools, vegetable gardens flourish","Keezhanelli, murunga keerai, mookirati, thuthi, tomatoes and pumpkin — these are vegetables not at a market, but grown in ‘Chutties Green Gardens’, in close to 400 government schools in Tiruvallur district.

The Tiruvallur district administration introduced the gardens in all its schools a few years ago, to promote healthy eating and the usage of organic vegetables among schoolchildren.

“Students of eco-clubs in the schools take care of the garden on a daily basis. I make surprise visits to schools in the district and ensure that the gardens are well maintained. The greenery really enhances the image of the schools,” said Maheshwari Ravikumar, Tiruvallur Collector.

Each garden has different vegetables growing, including spinach, potatoes, tomatoes, pumpkins, herbal plants and flowers, and some gardens have plantains too. “The vegetables are used to make food under the noon-meal scheme. Every morning and evening, the children water the garden and take care of it,” said N. Balakrishnan, district environmental co-ordinator, Tiruvallur.

T.V. Ashokan, head master, Arani Boys Higher Secondary School, Tiruvallur, said that he had noticed a change in the attitude of the students after the garden was started a few years ago. “The students have become more responsible. They make sure the garden is watered and taken care of,” he said.

The Sri Venkateswara Telugu Middle School in the Poonamallee Block has drumsticks, fruits like guava, gooseberries, pomegranate, plantain and spinach in a 500 square feet area. “I picked up the kids who were not participating in any activity and they were asked to take care of the plants. Now they have become very active and are maintaining it very well,” said G.A. Anitha, headmistress of the school.

The vegetables are not just used for cooking -- the teachers also purchase them. “The cash goes towards the development of the garden in the respective schools,” added Mr. Balakrishnan.

However, schools complain that the gardens are sometimes destroyed by miscreants. “There is an urgent need to raise the height of compound walls in the schools,” said one teacher.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aa4wrd/article30450217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01JANTH-Gardenjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/at-tiruvallur-government-schools-vegetable-gardens-flourish/article30450218.ece
161,2020/01/01,Tamil Nadu to assess micro-plastic pollution levels,"The Tamil Nadu government is set to undertake a study to assess the pollution caused by micro-plastics in coastal areas, estuaries and lakes.

The results of the proposed study would help collect baseline data on the status of micro-plastics in these areas. Based on the findings, appropriate remedial and management actions would also be considered by the government.

The study will be undertaken by the Environment Management Agency of Tamil Nadu through the Suganthi Devadason Marine Research Institute in Thoothukudi for three years, between 2019-20 and 2021-22, at a cost of ₹81.20 lakh.

The institute has already furnished a detailed project proposal for the study. Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board will fund the study.

The occurrence of micro-plastics in the environment is considered a global issue with environmental, economic and health implications.

Plastic is often the dominant pollutant in aquatic environments. Micro-plastics can also alter the physical conditions of marine habitats, according to a senior official in the Environment Department.

In a letter to government, the official explained that on sandy beaches, micro-plastics can affect the permeability and temperature of sediments when they settle on the matrix, with consequential effect on fauna which are temperature-sensitive.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rgenf7/article30448779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18isbs-plasticGOT6RTBLI3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-to-assess-micro-plastic-pollution-levels/article30448778.ece
162,2020/01/01,Centre unlikely to fund Cauvery project,"The State government’s plan to secure full financial assistance from the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti for its flagship project, Nadanthai Vaazhi Cauvery, may not fructify.

About 10 days ago, Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam discussed the project with Secretary of the Jal Shakti Ministry U.P. Singh, apart from seeking funds for various other projects in the water sector. Though the Centre was appreciative of the idea of rejuvenating the Cauvery, and was willing to support the project in different ways, it did not “commit itself much” to supporting the project financially, an official told The Hindu.

Another official explained that the Union Ministry’s role will, even otherwise, be crucial for the project to take off. Getting an “in-principle clearance” from the Ministry, which was earlier known as Ministry of Water Resources, River Development & Ganga Rejuvenation, will be the pre-requisite to securing funds in any form from any source. A preliminary report has been submitted to the Ministry, and this has to be followed up with the preparation of a detailed project report. As per the preliminary report, the project’s cost is around ₹11,250 crore.

Broadly, there were two reasons for the State government to moot such a project. Apart from drawing inspiration from the Namami Gange initiative, the Centre had thought of taking up similar projects in respect of other major rivers, including the Cauvery, Narmada, Mahanadi and Godavari.

In June, when Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami presented a memorandum to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he sought Central assistance for Nadanthai Vaazhi Cauvery.

In the light of the Central government’s response, the State government is mulling over two options. One, to tap funds from the existing Central schemes and tomeet a portion of the cost with the State’s own funds. There are Central funds already available for setting up sewage treatment plants.

And two, to let the Water Resources Conservation and Rivers Restoration Corporation borrow funds from different sources. The official added that steps were afoot to have staff sanctioned for the Corporation. In October, the government appointed K. Satyagopal, who retired as Additional Chief Secretary and Commissioner of Revenue Administration, as Chairman and Managing Director of the entity.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gp1039/article30447289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01CAUVERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jal-shakti-ministry-unlikely-to-fund-cauvery-project/article30447290.ece
163,2020/01/01,BJP to hold pro-CAA kolam protest today,"With kolam protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens gaining ground across the country, the BJP is planning to hold similar protests in support of the CAA in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday.

“We are all going to hold pro-CAA protests across Tamil Nadu on New Year’s Day. The members of the party’s women’s wing and everyone who supports the CAA will draw kolams bearing the message ‘CAA Vendum (We want CAA)’ outside their homes,” A.R. Mahalakshmi, president of the State BJP’s women’s wing, told The Hindu.

Outreach plan

Meanwhile, the BJP has planned a massive outreach programme on the CAA in Tamil Nadu, and has finalised a group of 17 leaders, who will hold public rallies to explain what the Act entails and gather support for it, in view of the protests against the controversial citizenship law across the country.

Sources said Union Ministers Piyush Goyal, Smriti Irani and Raj Kumar Singh, Deputy Chief Ministers of Karnataka Ashwath Narayan and Laxman Savadi, former Union Minister and MP Jayant Sinha, national vice-president of the BJP Baijayant Jay Panda and the party’s national general secretary, Ram Madhav, have been deputed for the task. The rallies are likely to begin in the first week of January.

“People are being misled by the DMK and the Congress. To take the truth about the Act to the public, we will be holding the rallies,” senior BJP leader Pon. Radhakrishnan said.

He accused the two parties of trying to create a scenario similar to the one that prevailed during partition. “Who gave them the right to incite violence? It is important to stop the false propaganda of these parties...it is everyone’s duty. We will be exposing their lies and bringing out the facts,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xs0nb9/article30295453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13DECTH-PONRAR21,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bjp-to-hold-pro-caa-kolam-protest-today/article30447193.ece
164,2020/01/01,Elephant carcass found near Andhra Pradesh border,"A wild male elephant was found dead in the forest area bordering Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh on Tuesday.

A Forest Department official said the tusker, about 30 years old, could have died due to electrocution, after coming in contact with an electric fence.

Its carcass was found in the area adjoining Paradarami under Gudiyatham forest range in Vellore district and Chittoor district forest range in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh.

Some local residents spotted the dead elephant in the forest on Tuesday morning when they had taken cattle for grazing and informed Forest Department personnel. Since the region bordered both Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, a team of Forest Department personnel from Gudiyatham forest range and Chittoor range reached the spot for investigation.

Vellore district collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram visited the spot in the afternoon.

Talking to the media, Mr. Sundaram said, “We have asked the locals not to erect electric fences illegally. We will take action against anyone who does.”

165,2020/01/01,AIADMK remains in power thanks to PMK’s work in bypolls: Anbumani,"PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss on Tuesday claimed that the AIADMK had managed to stay in power only because it was in an alliance with the PMK. It was his party’s sustained work during last year’s byelections to 21 Assembly constituencies that had strengthened the AIADMK’s hold on power, he claimed.

Speaking at the special general council meeting of the PMK at Omandur near Tindivanam, he said the party had changed its strategy and had aligned with the AIADMK during the 2019 Lok Sabha election by virtue of political necessity.

“The PMK worked hard in the 2016 elections. Though we were appreciated by the people, they did not give us seats. The PMK aligned with the AIADMK and extended its support to the ruling party in the [2019] elections due to political necessity. We stood by the AIADMK in the byelections to 21 Assembly constituencies, and this enabled them to remain in power,” he claimed.

He accused the AIADMK of not having recognised the full potential of the PMK while allotting the wards for the elections to rural local bodies. He appealed to the ruling party to listen to the suggestions of the PMK instead of offering seats as charity.

Contending that the year 2020 will pose several challenges to his party, he urged the rank and file to counter the DMK’s criticism and false propaganda against the PMK. He expressed his unhappiness with the attitude of some district secretaries and deputy general secretaries, who sought to promote the interest of kith and kin during the recently-concluded rural local body elections. A few in the party had contested the elections for panchayat wards in spite of clear directions from the high command not to do so. The party’s performance was more important than personal aggrandisement, he said.

Vote bank target

Speaking at the meeting, PMK founder S. Ramadoss appealed to the district secretaries and deputy general secretaries of the party to dedicate themselves to its growth and ensure that it achieved a vote bank target of 80 lakh voters in 80 Assembly constituencies for the next Assembly election.

Hitting out at the district secretaries and deputy general secretaries for remaining ‘lethargic’ and ‘laid-back’ instead of getting the workers geared up, he said the workers should complete the task within six months, and the high command would review their work in July.

The posts of district secretaries and deputy general secretaries were not ornamental positions, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/l6p4g4/article30136787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02DECTH-ANBUMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-remains-in-power-thanks-to-pmks-work-in-bypolls-anbumani/article30447190.ece
166,2020/01/01,‘CAA has united people of all faiths rather than dividing them’,"While the BJP-led government at the Centre has attempted to divide people on religious lines with the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the legislation has rather united people of all faiths in the country against it, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi leader M.H. Jawahirullah has said.

Addressing a massive anti-CAA rally organised by Jamaats and Muslim organisations here on Tuesday, he said Hindus had shown solidarity with Muslims on the issue.

In response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that protesters could be identified with their clothes, a few Hindus came in burkas and asked the government to identify them.

Noting that Jamia Millia Islamia was at the centre of the anti-CAA protests, Mr. Jawahirullah said the university was founded by freedom fighters. “A Hindu student, while speaking against the CAA, said he wanted secular India back. That used to be the spirit of the freedom movement in the country,” he added.

Referring to the demonetisation exercise during the first term of the Modi government, he said, “The first [Modi] government made currency notes in denominations of ₹1,000 and ₹500 invalid. The second government has made Indian citizenship invalid.”

Taking a dig at the State government over its stand on the National Population Register (NPR), he said it was the first step towards implementing the National Register of Citizens and the CAA. He urged people not to give any documents for the NPR.

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan said the Prime Minister was lying when he said that the Cabinet had never discussed the implementation of the NRC. “Union Ministers have given replies in writing about its implementation in Parliament,” he said.

When MPs of Tamil Nadu spoke against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament, the Modi government did not listen to their remarks that it was against the democratic fabric of the country. But now, when the entire country was in turmoil, the Union Home Ministry was seeking people’s opinion on its implementation, he said.

“But now, no patriot is ready to compromise with the anti-nationals. We will continue the fight till the anti-nationals are chased away,” he added. He wondered why the Tamil Nadu police had not booked BJP leader H. Raja for saying that if students threw stones from inside their colleges, bombs would be hurled back at them.

Leaders from the DMK, the Congress, the MDMK, the VCK, the May 17 Movement and various Muslim organisations took part in the protest, which drew thousands of people carrying the national flag and placards reading “Say No to CAA/NRC”.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ul657e/article30447165.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01CAA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/caa-has-united-people-of-all-faiths-rather-than-dividing-them/article30447166.ece

""I have not made any such comments and there is no ambiguity on our party's stand on the issue since the beginning,"" he told The Hindu on Thursday.

Mr. KTR argued that when the Bill has already become an Act, there was no way the party could now support CAA, and that too after voting against it in Parliament.

171,2020/01/01,Uttam seeks stay on municipal polls,"A PIL plea has been filed in Telangana High Court seeking an order to stay elections to 120 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations.

The petition filed by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy will be heard on Thursday by a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy. The petitioner’s main contention is that issuing notification without announcing reservations to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes (SC, ST, BC) and women was arbitrary and illegal.

The petitioner contended that the State government had hurriedly issued a final notification on December 17 last announcing division of wards in the 130 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for which elections notification was eventually issued by the State Election Commission (SEC) on December 23. Mr. Reddy said in the plea that the respondents, the State government, municipal administration director and SEC, deliberately didn’t finalise reservations to SC, ST, BC and women.

This was contrary to sections six and seven of Telangana Municipalities Act, the plea said. As per section six of the Act, the mandatory reservations to different groups should be finalised at the earliest in the manner prescribed under section seven. The petitioner said the SEC did not give proper response or clarification when the matter was raised during a meeting with the representatives of political parties. The SEC declined to listen to the suggestions or view of the political parties on the matter.

Mr. Reddy contended that unless the reservations are announced well in advance the prospective contestants cannot secure caste certificates and other documents for filing nominations. The notification issued by the SEC on December 23 last itself was contrary to the provisions of the Telangana Municipalities Act, the petitioner stated.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sx2s2r/article30457221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy02poll-modecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/uttam-seeks-stay-on-municipal-polls/article30452985.ece
172,2020/01/01,Pharma City to be launched this year,"Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao said that there were no more obstacles in the way of grounding the Pharma City project at Mucherla, 40 km from here, as the State government had obtained the National Investment and Manufacturing Zone (NIMZ) approval and the environmental clearance for it from the Centre.

The land acquisition for 10,000 acres was also over while 2,000 acres more was needed, Mr. Rao told media persons in an informal chat here on Wednesday.

He said the government would launch Pharma City as the world’s biggest pharma cluster this year, something which he would inform the board meeting of Indian Pharmaceutical Association that he would attend in Mumbai in a few days. The same had already been conveyed to the top brass of Piramal group, global conglomerate in pharma industry, seeking its participation.

Mr. Rao also said basic infrastructure at the Pharma City like setting up sub-stations and laying roads had already commenced. The government would have to work on establishing an effluent treatment plant with the objective to make it a pollution-free project.

Making a point that the next decade would unfold with interesting developments in terms of growth story for Telangana, Mr. Rao said the focus would be on giving impetus to electronics, manufacturing, textiles and food processing. The metro rail works would be launched in the old city of Hyderabad after the Jubilee Bus Station- Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station corridor was opened to traffic.

He expressed his conviction to implement the new Municipal Act effectively this year, holding officials responsible for any lapses and taking the public into confidence. The officials would be answerable if building permissions for houses of more than 75 sq yds were not given within 21 days as stipulated under the Act. The permissions would any case go to the applicants on the 21st day either by e-mail or any other electronic mode of communication.

The government would be liberal with the public by accepting on-face value self-certification for permission to houses less than 75 sq yds. The payment of property tax would also be by self-assessment. If the declarations turned out to be false, the punishment as provided in the Act would be imposed at the rate of 25 times that normal charge.

Illegal constructions were earlier looked into by serving notices. But, the Act provided demolition of buildings without any notice. The Collectors would exercise powers to crack down on such structures.

173,2020/01/01,How Telangana embraced the ‘incubator boom’,"The past 10 years have proven why and how Telangana has become synonymous with entrepreneurship on the startup level. After all, the 2014 Telangana state formation had a direct effect on young entrepreneurs, giving them pause to think about how their new state would affect their funding and how their business is shaped. Interestingly, startup hubs and incubators reaped the richest rewards from this politically volatile time, making sure the incentive of a fresh new state economy held a lot of promise. Incubators underpin the evolving modernity of Telangana and the country.

It’s been a decade of boost after boost with the most recent startup industry valuation coming to about US$4.2 billion, according to Nasscom, from January to September 2018... an increase of 108% from the previous year. Here, we pay homage to two schools of incubators which put Telangana on the international enterprise map.

Keep it old school

One of the oldest startup incubators — and one of the state’s most respected centres — is Bala Vikasa, a community development organisation founded in 1991 by Bala Singareddy and Andre Gingras. Bala Vikasa has maintained itself as a registered non-profit and secular community development organisation. Since its inception, Bala Vikasa has impacted the lives of five million rural poor in India over the past 42 years through variety of community driven development projects such as tank desiltation, water purification, sujal ATW, model villages and more. Bala Vikasa retains its status as a centre to keep old means alive.

Last July, Bala Vikasa teamed up with Verizon India for a state-wide desiltation programme which employs the age-old technique of removing silt from water tanks to improve water saving levels as well as fertilisation of the fields where the silt is deposited. By the end of the ongoing project, 1500 acres of farmlands would receive silt, water percolation rate will improve significantly, thereby increasing water table levels in and around the village, says Shoury Reddy, executive director of Bala Vikasa. Come summer 2020, the farming communities around the state would have wells of the saved water. Forward thinking is what kept Bala Vikasa in the game and they have an innovation hub in construction with an inauguration date to be set within the next two years.

To the future

Having opened in late 2015, T-Hub is one of the country’s most influential startup hub, defining itself as more of an “ecosystem”, housing more than 150 startups across more than a dozen subcultures of technology.

In the environmental realm is Banyan Nation, one of the country’s first vertically-integrated plastic recycling companies that helps global brands use more recycled plastic instead of virgin plastic. Taking on the wearables market is Hug Innovations who make smartwatches with a more personal touch. Then there is the nationally-known MyGate, an advanced security and community management app used in more than 13 cities with over 1.2 million users. Then there is Gayam Motor Works, which manufactures electric smart-autos at affordable rates.

The impact of T-Hub has been the most tangible and over the years, the centre has hosted regional, national and international events which offer opportunities to young enterprises to network with each other and with potential investors. These events have featured well-known entities such as Facebook, Blockchained India, Get In The Ring and government bodies talking about policy. Much of the T-Hub tag is the exclusivity; getting one’s startup in the door is no small feat. While the Internet can provide only so many resources, T-Hub managed to get a leg up and offer inter-personal meets with some of the industry’s head-honchos.

In a December 24 blog post on the official website by CEO Ravi Narayanan, T-Hub reflects, “The growth of the startup ecosystem in the last 14 years have been a testament to the ingenuity of Indian entrepreneurs. Bringing corporations and the government to actively procure from startups will herald a new wave of unprecedented growth for the Indian startup ecosystem. Together, this will build tomorrow’s innovation ecosystem that ushers in an era of transformative and disruptive corporate innovation.”

In 2019, the incubator space took a surprising but welcome turn for cinema creatives with the launch of 25,000 square feet C Space by actor Navdeep Pallapolu and financial consultant Pavan Goparaju.

Despite a rough financial year, WeWork made a home in Hyderabad with two setups in Financial District (four floors) and Kondapur (14 floors), offering its unique brand of holistic startup rearing with a focus on mental health. Most of the startups across WeWork are in the marketing and advertising disciplines though.

What is next?

What took place over the past 10 years is probably going to be a mere fraction of what is to come. T-Hub’s second phase in Hitec City is in construction while many are already anticipating the launch of Compass in Hyderabad by former Amazon director of software development, Jaideep Ganguly. Compass is a New York-based tech startup incubator, bringing the industry’s top talent and startups under one roof to discuss the different layers of running a business in the modern economy while still retaining personal philosophies.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ozc0je/article30451313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01MP-T-HUB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/how-2010-to-2019-had-telangana-embracing-incubator-boom/article30451316.ece

175,2020/01/01,Giving up a cushy life to serve society,"He was a successful businessman with a passion for adventure sports. But a commitment towards serving society made him give up his cosy life in Hyderabad.

Nookala Abhinay Reddy, 36, who is now sarpanch of Purushottamayagudem village in Maripeda mandal, keeps busy at his agriculture fields and mango orchard throughout the day. If not found there, he can be seen interacting with the people about village development.

Mr Reddy, who holds a B.Com degree, co-owns a restaurant called Beach House in Madhapur, a bustling area in Hyderabad, with his brother.

As for his interest in adventure sports, he won Mahindra trophy in 2014-15 in an off-roading jeep challenge and took part in Rainforest Challenge International in Goa.

Interest in charity

“I was born and brought up in Hyderabad, but always wanted to come back to village and live with these people despite hailing from an affluent family. I am interested in charity work and politics. I was elected sarpanch in the last election,” he told The Hindu.

His father, Nookala Naresh Reddy, is a general secretary of the ruling TRS. “I am now looking after my family’s agricultural fields and working for the village development as well,” he said, adding that he also runs a NGO called Sneha Youth which has produced many leaders and helped the needy.

The 64-year-old Ged was admitted to intensive care but his condition improved sufficiently for his son to play in a Test England lost by 107 runs.

Ged remains in hospital, with wife Deborah at his side.

“If someone could say ‘I’ll take everything away from you that happened this summer, but your dad is happy, healthy and watching you play cricket’ then I’d say yeah, swap it,” Stokes wrote in his column for Daily Mirror newspaper.

177,2020/01/01,Lyon not for four-day Tests,"The ICC’s proposal to introduce four-day Tests has met with stiff opposition from leading Australia spinner Nathan Lyon, who termed it “ridiculous” while chief coach Justin Langer is also not in favour of tinkering with the traditional format.

“I’m totally against it and I hope ICC aren’t even considering it,” Lyon said on The Unplayable Podcast. “You look at all the big games around the world and some of the best Test matches I’ve been part of, they go down to the last day,” he added.

Langer during an interaction with reporters said that while the option can be looked at, from a personal viewpoint, he won’t like any changes.

“My preference — I’m a traditionalist and anyone who knows me, I don’t like to change too much — so I probably prefer five-day Test matches,” said Langer.

“But again, like with wickets and like with schedules, if four-day Test matches keeps Test cricket alive, then it worth looking at. But I love five days only because I’m boring and don’t like to change much.”

“It’s a challenge,” Lyon said on five-day Tests. “You challenge yourself in different ways — physically and mentally.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/149t6r/article30453775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02LYON,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/lyon-not-for-four-day-tests/article30453776.ece
178,2020/01/01,Can Ben stoke an English revival?,"Ben Stokes returns to the scene of one of his most spectacular performances but the circumstances are different going into the second Test between England and South Africa at Newlands on Friday.

Sensational knock

Four years ago, Stokes thrashed 258 off 198 balls in a brutal display of power-hitting, collecting 11 sixes and sharing in a world Test record sixth-wicket partnership of 399 with Jonny Bairstow, whose 150 not out from 191 balls was scarcely pedestrian.

England went into that match 1-0 up in a four-Test series which it went on to win. This time it is the team needing to catch up after losing the opening encounter in Centurion.

South Africa was captained by Hashim Amla, who effectively acknowledged his lack of aptitude for the job by resigning from it after the match despite making a double century of his own to ensure a high-scoring draw.

Poor away record

On this occasion, it is England’s captain Joe Root, who is under pressure because of his team’s poor recent record away from home. Stokes then was on his way to becoming England’s talisman, a status which he cemented during 2019 and ended with him being awarded an OBE in Britain’s New Year honours’ list.

Bairstow, though, has gone backwards. He seems unlikely to play at Newlands this time after falling for one and nine at Centurion, where he only played because of Ollie Pope’s illness.

Newlands in 2016 provided an unusually benign pitch for batsmen, with both teams scoring over 600 in a first innings which only ended late on the fourth day.

It is the only one of the most recent 11 Test matches at Newlands, going back to 2011, to have ended in a draw. South Africa has won nine of the other ten, losing once. Totals over 400 have been rare, with only four instances other than the 2016 run feast. There is a new groundsman but it seems reasonable to expect a fair contest between bat and ball this time around.

Malan for Markram

After winning the first Test in Centurion by 107 runs, South Africa is likely to make one forced change with opening batsman Pieter Malan expected to win his first cap in place of the injured Aiden Markram.

England opted to go into the first Test without a spinner but Newlands is a ground where spin bowlers are usually needed. It is a dilemma for England, with Jack Leach having been ill virtually since the team’s arrival. Although he is now reportedly recovering and out of quarantine he is unlikely to be considered match fit.

Leg-spinner Matt Parkinson was unimpressive in two warm-up matches and off-spinner Dom Bess, flown out on standby because of the illness in the camp, could be selected, possibly ahead of James Anderson.

The teams (likely):

South Africa: Faf du Plessis (Capt.), Dean Elgar, Pieter Malan, Zubayr Hamza, Rassie van der Dussen, Quinton de Kock (wk), Dwaine Pretorius, Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje.

England: Joe Root (Capt.), Rory Burns, Dom Sibley, Joe Denly, Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope, Jos Buttler (wk), Sam Curran, Dom Bess, Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/jp80n7/article30453746.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02BEN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/can-ben-stoke-an-english-revival/article30453749.ece
179,2020/01/01,Alonso set to become the first F1 champion to compete in Dakar Rally,"Spain’s Fernando Alonso is set to become the first Formula One champion to compete in the Dakar Rally, which starts in Saudi Arabia on Sunday.

“The biggest challenge of my career,” the 38-year-old Alonso said, referring to the world’s most grueling race, Efe News reported.

Alonso, who won the F1 title in 2005 and 2006, entered the Dakar Rally, whose 2020 edition leaves behind South America for Saudi Arabia, as part of his quest to become a more complete and versatile driver.

About 20 F1 drivers have competed in the Dakar Rally over the years, but Alonso is the first World champion to do so. Belgium’s Jacky Ickx became the first former F1 driver to win the Dakar Rally, finishing first in 1983 and second in 1986 and 1989.

Expectations

The expectations for Alonso are comparable to those raised by French driver Sebastien Loeb, a nine-time World rally champion who competed in the Dakar Rally from 2016 to 2019, winning 13 stages but never finishing first overall.

“If Loeb still hasn’t won the Dakar, imagine me, who is coming from asphalt. I think the goal is more to approach the rally as an enriching experience for us,” Alonso said before leaving for Saudi Arabia.

The 45-year-old Loeb was unable to take home the bronze Touareg Trophy despite being the best driver in rally history and having skills that fit the Dakar Rally better than F1.

Even though Loeb did not have to make huge adjustments, he still came up short in his bid to win the Dakar, whose inaugural edition was held in 1979.

Alonso, who has always driven alone, will have veteran Marc Coma, a five-time rally champion in the motorcycle category, helping him navigate the route.

The Spanish driver has the triple crown of motor racing within reach.

In Saudi Arabia, a route covering nearly 8,000km, with more than 5,000km timed, awaits racers, who will start in Jeddah and finish in Qiddiyah. The Dakar Rally starts on January 5 and ends on Jan. 17.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/m95o77/article30453713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02ALONSO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/alonso-set-to-become-the-first-f1-champion-to-compete-in-dakar-rally/article30453714.ece
180,2020/01/01,I believe we can make Tokyo final: Manpreet,"The Indian men’s hockey team captain Manpreet Singh believes India has the capability of reaching the final of the Tokyo Olympics, provided a sense of discipline and consistency is maintained.

Leaving behind a disappointing 2018 where India crashed out in the quarterfinals of the World Cup at home, the Manpreet-led side has managed to maintain its consistency and qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics under a new coach in Australian Graham Reid.

Productive year

Reviewing the year gone by, Manpreet said 2019 has been productive for the team in terms of its performances despite not getting enough opportunities to compete in high-level international tournaments.

“Looking back, 2019 has been very good for us. We started the year in the fifth spot and managed to maintain that. The biggest aim for us in 2019 was to qualify for the Olympics and we have managed to achieve that under a new coach,” Manpreet said.

“Our main target in 2019 is to reach the finals of the Olympics and believe me it’s achievable. Throughout the year we have managed to maintain the No. 5 position in world rankings and there is no reason why we can’t climb from that. But for that, we have to maintain the consistency which we have showed in the entire 2019,” he added.

The ace midfielder, who has been nominated for the 2019 FIH Player-of-the-Year Award, said encounters against top teams like the Netherlands, world champion Belgium and Australia in the upcoming FIH Pro league will give India a fair idea about where the eight-time Olympic champion stands.

India, which pulled out of the inaugural edition of the Pro League, will play the Dutch side on January 18 and 19 before hosting Belgium on Feb. 8 and 9, followed by two more home fixtures against Australia on Feb. 22 and 23.

“The FIH Pro League is our first step towards Olympic preparation. In the Pro League, we will get to face all the top teams of the world before the Olympics and this experience will give us an idea where we stand before the Olympics.”

Transition

The skipper said the biggest takeaway for the Indian men’s hockey team in 2019 was the transition of quite a few young players into the senior fold. “In 2019, we witnessed quite a few young players making it into the senior side.

“They performed to their potential at the international level and outsmarted some of the senior guys. It’s the biggest positive for us, especially in a busy year, where we will be competing at the FIH Pro-League be sides the Olympics,” Manpreet said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/ln18pf/article30453676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02SINGHA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/i-believe-we-can-make-tokyo-final-manpreet/article30453678.ece

183,2020/01/01,There’s a bright future for us: Misbah,"Banking on young talent, Pakistan head coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq hoped for better results in 2020 and indicated that a few seniors may not return to the national side.

Misbah hailed the emergence of batsman Babar Azam and the pace duo of Naseem Shah and Shaheen Afridi in 2019, a year he termed as “tough” for Pakistan in Test cricket.

“Going further we have to improve a lot of things in both red-ball and white-ball cricket. This team has enough potential and the new boys are also making their way into international cricket. There’s certainly a bright future ahead for us,” Misbah said.

The coach was lavish in his praise of Babar. “Babar’s emergence as a mega star across formats is very good news for Pakistan cricket. He remained No. 1 in T20Is and is in the top-10 in ODIs.

“He played some brilliant innings in the World Cup and ended the year by establishing himself as a Test batsman with scintillating performances in Australia and two centuries against Sri Lanka in Pakistan.”

Misbah was also delighted at Naseem and Afridi’s impressive start to the five-day format. “Naseem got a five-for in the last Test against Sri Lanka. Shaheen bowled well in the World Cup, showed glimpses of being a Test bowler in South Africa, bowled really well in Australia and also in Pakistan against Sri Lanka. We will, hopefully, bank on these two promising fast bowlers in the future.

“Overall, we are on the right track. The more we play the longer format, the more we will improve. We need to do a lot of work in white-ball cricket ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup in Australia,” said Misbah.

The coach did not name anyone, but his comments indicated that it was the end of the road for Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/1kyy3h/article30453528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02MISBAH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/theres-a-bright-future-for-us-misbah/article30453529.ece
184,2020/01/01,Babar turns it around in Tests,"Pakistan’s top batsman and T20 skipper Babar Azam says he spent a good part of 2019 correcting the mistakes he made in Test cricket and now has a better understanding of the format’s nuances.

Babar said he wasn’t living up to his own expectations in Tests for the last two years.

Finding his way

“This year, I worked on rectifying the mistakes I made in the format and was able to overcome some of them. That helped me make some runs. The more you play the longer format, the more you understand its nuances and find your way,” said Babar.

In six Tests, Babar scored 616 runs (three hundreds and three half-centuries) at 68.44 at a hugely impressive strike-rate of 72.30 last year while in 20 ODIs, he totalled 1,092 runs with three centuries and six half-centuries at 60.66. His strike-rate was 93.30.

In 10 T20Is, Babar contributed 374 runs (four fifties) at 41.55 with a strike-rate of 136.99.

He felt that getting runs in South Africa gave him immense confidence.

“My innings in South Africa against Dale Steyn gave me great pleasure and confidence that I can get into the Test match zone. I also learned how to convert 60s and 70s into 100s. The century in Australia gave me confidence that I can make big runs in the format,” he said.

Self-belief

Babar added that when a batsman gets runs in countries like South Africa, Australia and New Zealand against formidable bowling attacks, he gets self-belief and confidence.

“I rate the century against Australia as my best innings of the year in the Test format,” he said.

He is the only Pakistan cricketer in the ICC rankings to feature in the top-six in all the three formats — No. 6 in Tests, No. 3 in ODIs and No. 1 in T20Is.

“I used to score runs earlier but sometimes I wasn’t able to produce match-winning performances. I tried to improve on that aspect, learned how to bat and win games under pressure, which was a big learning curve for me,” said Babar.

Record tally

He also talked about the ICC World Cup, his first as a player. Babar made a Pakistan record of 474 runs in the mega event at an average of 67.71.

“It was a big occasion and I really enjoyed the tournament. As a kid, I used to follow World Cups very keenly on television. When I got selected for the big event, I set a goal of doing something big and different,” he said.

“Being the top batsman in my team was always a target for me. The World Cup gave me an opportunity to get recognised at the highest level and it gave me real satisfaction.

“My innings against New Zealand (101 not out, 127b, 11x4) was my best in the tournament and it taught me a great deal of how to bat and bail the team out in a pressure situation.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/lgdlvf/article30453497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02BABAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/babar-turns-it-around-in-tests/article30453498.ece
185,2020/01/01,A new nations tournament all set to take off,"The ATP Cup, the innovative new team championship kicks off the men’s 2020 season on Friday, with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic among those looking for a winning start ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year.

The event will see 24 nations split into six groups across three Australian cities, with eight teams emerging from the round-robin to compete in a knockout phase until one country is left standing.

It is the sport’s newest tournament and the third men’s team event competing for the hearts and minds — and dollars — of fans, along with a revamped Davis Cup and the annual Laver Cup, which pits Europe against the rest of the world.

But it has already suffered setbacks, with major Roger Federer opting to give it a miss and Andy Murray and Kei Nishikori pulling out injured. However, most of the world’s top 30 are playing.

Despite this, World No. 2 Djokovic said the move towards more team tennis was good for a sport best known for the individuality of its global superstars.

“More than 90% of the time, we’re playing as individuals and we don’t have too many team events,” said the Serbian, who also heads the ATP player council.

“This is going to bring together a lot of nations and, for me personally, it will be a very nice and proud moment to represent my country. An event like this is truly going to make an impact.”

Sydney hosts the final, along with group games, which are also held in Brisbane and Perth with $15 million in prize money and up to 750 singles and 250 doubles ATP rankings points at stake.

With bushfires raging around Sydney and elsewhere in the country, tournament director Tom Larner said officials were ready in the event of air quality problems. The championship, from January 3-12, will feature two ties each day in the three cities during the round robin, comprising two singles matches then a doubles.

Under the format, the second-ranked singles players from each country face each other first, then the top-ranked men ahead of a potentially decisive doubles. A country winning two of three matches will claim the tie.

As well as the players, some big-name former stars are captaining their countries, including Boris Becker (Germany), Marat Safin (Russia), Tim Henman (Britain), Lleyton Hewitt (Australia), and Thomas Muster (Austria).

The groupings: Group A (Brisbane): Serbia, France, South Africa, Chile; Group B (Perth): Spain, Japan, Georgia, Uruguay; Group C (Sydney): Bulgaria, Belgium, Great Britain, Moldova; Group D (Perth): Russia, Italy, USA, Norway; Group E (Sydney): Austria, Croatia, Argentina, Poland; Group F (Brisbane): Germany, Greece, Canada, Australia.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/1la62f/article30453469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02JOKER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/a-new-nations-tournament-all-set-to-take-off/article30453471.ece

188,2020/01/01,We have to counter the breeze factor: Rahane,"Ajinkya Rahane doesn’t fuss over technical issues but India’s Test vice-captain feels that the breeze in Wellington and Christchurch needs to be factored in during the team’s upcoming two-Test series against New Zealand next month.

India will be playing two Tests in Wellington (February 21-25) and Christchurch (February 29-March 4) after five T20Is and three ODIs.

In an exclusive interview to PTI, Rahane spoke on a host of issues with regard to the upcoming tour where the current team has a good chance of emulating the class of 2009 under M.S. Dhoni’s captaincy.

“We played there in 2014... there is a breeze factor that is involved. I guess getting used to conditions will be the key as there will be more sideways movement because of breeze,” Rahane said when asked about the challenges.

“In the last tour, I played in Wellington but [in] Christchurch, we will be playing a Test match after long time. Getting used to conditions will be key,” he added.

Bowler to watch

Rahane, who has been doing his homework for the tour, singled out left-arm fast bowler Neil Wagner as the bowler to watch out for after his recent exploits against Australia and prior to that, England. “Wagner did well in the recent series (27 wickets from last 4 Tests). You can’t take just one name. As a batting unit, you’ve got to respect every bowler.

Natural game

“As a home team, they have an advantage knowing conditions well but, at the same time, we need to play our natural game also,” said the 31-year-old, who has scored 4112 runs in 63 Test matches.

With Trent Boult and Wagner looking to bring the ball back into the right-handers, Rahane feels that standing outside the crease to counter the swing could be the way to deal with them but then, to each his own.

Different ways

“There are different ways to counter different kinds of bowling. Everyone has a different method. Few players love standing outside the crease (to negate the swing) and some stand deep inside the crease.

“Some take middle-stump guard, few take leg-stump guard. Individual players should stick to their own strengths.”

In New Zealand, playing as close as possible to the body will be very important, said Rahane. “You have to focus on the basics as you can’t think too much about your technique. It’s about keeping your game simple, playing close to the body, as late as possible and according to the situation. Pace and bounce will be different.”

Ideal preparation

Rahane will be playing for India-A in the the second four-day ‘Test’ against New Zealand-A to prepare for the big series.

“I think it’s a good idea to have shadow tours with India-A. So, before playing Test matches, if India-A matches are there, it’s good preparation for us. It helps in acclimatisation.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/eh1nfj/article30453293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02RAHANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/we-have-to-counter-the-breeze-factor-rahane/article30453294.ece
189,2020/01/01,Brighton dampens Chelsea’s party,"Alireza Jahanbakhsh’s spectacular overhead kick earned Brighton a share of the points against Chelsea and dampened Frank Lampard’s New Year celebrations on Wednesday even as Aston Villa secured a vital win against Burnley.

Kicking off a packed day of top-flight action, Chelsea’s 1-1 draw on England’s south coast meant it missed out on the chance to pull seven points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United in the race to secure Champions League football for next season.

Cesar Azpilicueta gave the visitors an early lead, tapping in from close range following a corner in the 10th minute but Brighton was never out of it and pulled level in the 84th minute courtesy of Jahanbakhsh’s moment of magic.

Chelsea was quickly on top from the start of the match but Brighton came into the contest as it wore on, enjoying a spell of possession towards the end of the first half.

Leandro Trossard tested Kepa Arrizabalaga with a powerful strike but the Chelsea goalkeeper parried the shot with his right hand.

Lampard’s team was again dominant after the break. Christian Pulisic came close to doubling Chelsea’s lead at Brighton after 55 minutes while N’Golo Kante and Reece James were denied.

But Brighton kept battling and Kepa was forced to produce an outstanding save from Aaron Connolly in the 80th minute as the home side pushed for an equaliser.

Persistence pays

Its persistence paid off minutes later. Lewis Dunk kept the ball alive from a corner-kick and Iranian midfielder Jahanbakhsh acrobatically found the bottom-left corner to give his team share of the points.

In the other early kick-off, Villa beat Burnley 2-1 despite seeing Jack Grealish’s opening goal controversially chalked off by VAR.

Wesley put Villa ahead in the 27th minute and captain Grealish doubled his side’s advantage four minutes before the break as his powerful effort found the top corner.

Chris Wood pulled a goal back for Burnley with 10 minutes to go.

For struggling Aston Villa it was its second away win of the Premier League season — its first league win at Turf Moor since 1936.

VAR intervention

Villa thought it had taken an 11th minute lead through a diving header from Grealish but a VAR review found that Wesley’s heel was marginally offside during the move and the goal was over-turned.

It was Wesley who did open the scoring though — the impressive Grealish finding him in the box and the Brazilian swivelled and fired past Nick Pope to give Villa a deserved lead.

Burnley was unusually sloppy in defence and it was no shock when Grealish doubled Villa’s lead, finishing off a lovely passing move with a confident curling finish.

The results: Brighton 1 (Jahanbakhsh 84) drew with Chelsea 1 (Azpilicueta 10); Burnley 1 (Wood 80) lost to Aston Villa 2 (Wesley 27, Grealish 41).",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/sxy2bg/article30453259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02FOOT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/brighton-dampens-chelseas-party/article30453260.ece
190,2020/01/01,"AMU, Jamia are emerging as epicentres of a national awareness","Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) is a political parable in today’s lunatic times, holding protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The police entered the campus, wounded students and filed multiple FIRs against hundreds of them under stringent laws, in connivance with the university administration. All this happened when our Constitution, which is held in high regard globally, is in the midst of a visible eminent threat for the first time since Independence. A deliberate attempt is under way to rewrite it on communal lines.

AMU, that has earned eminence in academic ranking, is also a political enterprise that once mounted resistance to the British rule and contributed massively to nation building in the last 70 years. The university is locked today and the students have been forced to leave the campus. The forcible eviction of students from an institution of national importance is a wound that may heal with time, but the scars will persist.

Taken for granted

The CAA, when seen in conjunction with the National Register of Citizens (NRC), is preparing the grounds for violence in the nation. The silence that followed the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the Babri Majid verdict was taken for granted so much so that now Muslims are at the verge of losing citizenship. What adds to our worries is that all the important arms of our constitutional democracy — legislative, executive and judiciary — are openly displaying anti-Muslim prejudice.

When the political opposition in India fell like a pack of cards in Parliament, and Muslim leaders succumbed to their party lines while the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was enacted, it was a conscious decision by thousands of students of AMU to fight back. Aware of the implications and existential threat this new legislation poses and committed to the founding principles of the university, the students rose to the occasion and gathered on the campus for days to protest against this draconian Act.

It was in the spirit of AMU’s culture that the students opposed the communal and divisive CAA. From December 8 to 15, AMU students peacefully protested and demanded the rollback of the Act. On December 13, the AMU Students’ Union led a massive but peaceful march against the CAA and submitted a memorandum to the Chief Justice of India, asking him to declare the Act illegal and unconstitutional.

Partners in crime

Disturbed by the protests, the State machinery swung into action and barged into Jamia Millia Islamia and AMU, two universities with distinct character. The lockdown of the universities is a grim acknowledgment of the fact that rulers of the day lack the spine to intellectually engage with the students of the minority community. It is possible for the regime to send Human Resource Development Ministry officials to JNU to engage with protesters, but AMU and JMI can only expect tear-gas shells, stun grenades, bullets, pellets and hermeneutical violence. To add to the misery of the students, the ugly role of the AMU administration, which was aware of the ongoing peaceful protests but chose to be partners in crime with the U.P. police and permitted them to invade the campus despite their horrible record against minorities, was no less than a criminal act. The amputated hands, broken bones and injuries to over 100 students will remain the signposts of the students’ resistance. The verbal violence faced by the students from the police, as documented in the 32-page students’ union report, reflects how structural violence and deep-rooted institutional hate against Muslims in India exists under the garb of democracy.

India is going through a serious constitutional crisis due to the BJP’s Hindi, Hindu, Hindust(h)an agenda, which urgently requires rescue efforts. The State believes that excesses will instill fear in the hearts and minds of Muslims, but that must not be allowed to happen. At AMU, we have committed to fight for a humane and inclusive nation rooted in our freedom struggle that makes us equal citizens despite diversity of faiths and identities.

191,2020/01/01,Satcom technology being used for learning,"The Congress government in Rajasthan has started using satellite communication technology in a big way to enhance the learning outcome in educational institutions and generate awareness about social welfare schemes, while giving priority to the five aspirational districts selected by NITI Aayog in the State.

The Science & Technology Department has taken an initiative to provide the facility of receive only terminals (ROT) and satellite interactive terminals (SIT) for getting the services of subject experts in the government schools and colleges and propagate various schemes in the remote areas with no Internet connectivity.

State S&T Secretary Mugdha Sinha said here on Wednesday that the technique would be used during the first phase in approximately 2,000 institutions coming under various departments, such as education, higher education, social welfare, minority welfare, woman and child development and tribal area development.

Subject experts

The students studying English and science subjects in the government educational institutions will get services of subject experts through ROT and SIT. Ms. Sinha said the level of English and science subjects would be increased among students of Class VI to XII in order to get better results in the board examinations of Class X and XII.

The new programme’s facility will also be provided to all the 134 model schools, Kasturba Gandhi Girls’ Schools, Social Welfare Department’s hostels, children’s homes and students of a government college in each district. The institutions with the shortage of teachers will especially benefit from the geostationary satellite uplinking facilities.

Ms. Sinha said the people going for Haj pilgrimage, who were earlier required to come to Jaipur for training, would be trained at the district level through ROT and SIT installed in the government colleges.

The special focus of the initiative will be laid on the five aspirational districts selected by NITI Aayog — Karauli, Dholpur, Baran, Jaisalmer and Sirohi — where the satellite-related resources would be installed at the old age homes and children's homes. Ms. Sinha said eight community radio stations run by the S&T Department would publicise education-related schemes in these districts.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/satcom-technology-being-used-for-learning/article30453885.ece
192,2020/01/01,Stir mutes New Year buzz in Assam,"The State-wide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) dampened the New Year celebrations in Assam.

With popular singers and musicians taking the lead in the anti-CAA stir, very few functions were organised on New Year’s eve.

Many hotels avoided “confrontation with the agitators” by cancelling programmes.

The anti-CAA protests affected the popular year-end picnics that usually start around Christmas and end by mid-January on the Magh Bihu festival. This was mainly because of vigilantes attacking some picnic parties, including women, that were perceived to be indifferent to the movement.

“Videos of such attacks were posted on social media but we are yet to take any action as no complaints have been lodged,” a police officer in Morigaon district said.

The protests have also hit the tourism industry hard. Jayanta Malla Baruah, chairman of the Assam Tourism Development Corporation, said the protests had cost the State ₹1,000 crore in less than a month since December 11.

“Thousands of domestic and foreign tourists have cancelled travel and hotel bookings. We are anticipating a loss of ₹500 crore in January as countries such as the U.S., the UAE, Canada, the U.K., Australia, France, Israel, Taiwan, Russia, and Singapore have issued travel advisories to their citizens,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/h3nhlx/article30453882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TH-THGRP-ASSAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/stir-mutes-new-year-buzz-in-assam/article30453884.ece
193,2020/01/01,Anti-mafia drive won’t spare any harasser: M.P. Minister,"Madhya Pradesh Minister for Public Works and Environment Department Sajjan Singh Verma has warned that no land mafia and antisocial elements will be spared in the crackdown unleashed by the Congress government in the State.

“No harasser will be spared by the tempest of the drive,” said Mr. Verma.

Given a “free hand” by Chief Minister Kamal Nath, the authorities, amid allegations of expedient, politically motivated action, have brought down hundreds of illegal structures and apprehended scores of alleged kingpins enabling drug, land, sand and forest mafia and extortion rackets.

‘Clean and healthy M.P.’

“Mr. Nath wants a swachh [clean[), swasth [healthy] and surakshit [safe] Madhya Pradesh. Mafia of all kinds have flourished in the last 15 years under the BJP government,” claimed Mr. Verma.

On December 12, the Chief Minister had announced a law similar to the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act that would be enacted to curb organised mafia in the State.

In Bhopal district alone, 53 acres of land worth ₹46 crore has been freed in 19 locations in the last week, according to the Collectorate. “The police are already apprehending those at the bottom, but the drive is about nabbing the kingpins. It’s not just an anti-encroachment initiative, but also an anti-mafia one,” Bhopal Collector Tarun Kumar Pithode said.

Demolition of illegal establishments of Indore-based Jitu Soni, a businessman and owner of an eveninger, marked the drive’s start on December 5. Mr. Soni’s daily had published reports indicting senior government officials in the inter-State multicrore “honeytrap scandal”. Four days later, complying with a High Court order, the Bhopal administration razed a building housing the office of a journalists’ union.

195,2020/01/01,Alwar hospital staff suspended after infant’s death in blaze,"Six staff members of the Government Geetanand Children’s Hospital in Alwar, including two doctors, were suspended on Wednesday after an infant died in a fire that broke out in the hospital’s neonatal care unit due to a short circuit. An inquiry has found the medicos and others guilty of negligence.

A 22-day-old baby, who had sustained severe burn injuries in the fire on Tuesday, was referred to Jaipur’s Sir Padampat Mother & Child Hospital for treatment. She could barely survive a day and died of cardio-respiratory failure on Wednesday.

Besides the doctors — unit in-charge Mahesh Sharma and medical officer on duty Kirpal Singh — three nursing staffers and one ward boy were suspended on the basis of a preliminary inquiry report. The services of an electrician, who was on contractual appointment, were terminated.

Alwar Collector Inderjeet Singh said the victim’s next of kin would be given financial assistance as per the State government’s guidelines. The infant, born on December 10, was admitted to the hospital on December 24 following difficulty in respiration and was recovering in the newborn care unit.

‘CCTVs not working’

The inquiry conducted by the Medical & Health Department's Joint Director found that the CCTV cameras in the unit were dysfunctional for more than a year and the short-circuit in power supply could have been prevented if a miniature circuit breaker (MCB) was installed at the proper place.

There were 15 infants admitted to the neonatal care unit when the fire broke out in an oxygen pipeline connected to a radiant warmer early on Tuesday morning. The girl, who was in an incubator for treatment of pneumonia, suffered burn injuries on her face, chest and shoulder during the fire. As the fire broke out, other newborn children were shifted elsewhere in the hospital.

The death of 10 children at the government-run hospital during a 48-hour period on December 23-24 had triggered opposition criticism and a visit by a team from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).

Four children died on December 30 while five on December 31, all mainly due to low birth weight, hospital superintendent Dr. Suresh Dulara said.

Hospital authorities, however, said the number of deaths reported at the health facility in 2019 has witnessed decline since 2014 when 1,198 children died.

The nursing in-charge of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, which specialises in looking after premature and sick newborns, has been replaced, Dr. Dulara said.

Efforts for upgradation and maintenance of equipment at the hospital have been put in place, following directions by the Congress government in the State.

Medical College Principal Dr. Vijay Sardana said an order has been issued for installation of central oxygen supply line at the hospital and the work would be completed within 15 days.

BJP team visit

The direction was issued a day after a BJP parliamentary team comprising of MPs Locket Chatterjee, Kanta Kardam and Jaskaur Meena visited the hospital and expressed concern over its infrastructure.

The panel had said that two to three children were found on single beds and the hospital did not have enough nurses.

Dr. Sardana said the paediatric department at the health facility has been reconstructed, with its three units being functional in Jay Kay Lon hospital and a non-teaching unit working in New Medical College premises.

He said proposals for new OPD and emergency wards for paediatric and gynaecology departments have been incorporated in the proposed OPD Block under the Smart City Project.

On December 15, the winter vacation was advanced by a week and hostels were vacated after several students were injured in a clash with the police after a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act allegedly turned violent.

An official statement from the public relations office of AMU said due to overall prevailing situation, winter vacation of Aligarh Muslim University for students as well as for the teaching staff, had been extended and the university would not be opening on January 6, 2020.

The decision was taken at a consultative meeting of the Deans of Faculties, Principals of Colleges and Polytechnics and other functionaries of the university under the chairmanship of AMU Vice-Chancellor Professor Tariq Mansoor on Wednesday.

“A detailed schedule for opening of the university in a phased manner, the conduct of remaining examinations which could not be held in December 2019, commencement of classes for the next semester and the duration of the summer vacation shall be notified by the university in due course of time so that there is no academic loss to the students,” said Mujib Ullah Zuberi, Controller of Examination.

He added that students are advised to regularly visit the university website.

Sources said the university administration was waiting for the situation to defuse. “There are 10 thousand non-resident students, many of whom are still carrying on peaceful protest. Many resident students didn’t leave the city and continued to stay with their friends,” said a source requesting anonymity.

Over 60 injured

Over 60 people, including 40 students, AMU security staff and policemen, were injured in the violence. At least four students who received serious injuries are still being treated.

A number of injured students had alleged that police and the Rapid Action Police indulged in excesses. Police have booked 56 persons, including a number of students, for holding a protest which later turned violent.

They were surrounded by police personnel and a riot-control vehicle. “We take the pledge to struggle for the betterment of society, envisioned by Khusrau and Kabir. We take the pledge to make ineffective all conspiracies to toy with the foundations of the Constitution,” the students resolved.

200,2020/01/01,Indigenous people’s rights will be protected: Sonowal,"Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said here on Wednesday that protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) were premature since its rules had not been framed.

The recommendations submitted by the State government to the Centre for incorporating in the Act would protect the interests of the indigenous people of Assam, he told presspersons.

“No force can threaten the existence of the Assamese people as long as I am the Chief Minister,” Mr. Sonowal said.

“Rumours are being spread by the Congress and Left parties over the CAA. This is a national Act and not anything new. There is no truth in claims that the Act will bring in 1 crore to 2.5 crore Bangladeshis. Tea garden workers have been told foreigners will be settled on ceiling surplus land while villagers have been fed the fear that their vacant lands will be taken away by the beneficiaries of the CAA,” Mr. Sonowal said.

“There is no need to be afraid of the CAA. Our recommendations for framing the rules guarantee protection of the indigenous people,” the Chief Minister said, insisting that his government formed by the sons of the soil could not go against the people of Assam.

Alleging that rumours were fuelling anger against the Act, the Chief Minister said no government in Assam had since the signing of the Assam Accord in 1985 worked in the interest of the indigenous people.

The Accord had ended a violent six-year agitation for deporting “illegal migrants” from Assam.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s initiative led to the creation of the committee for implementing Clause 6 of the Assam Accord (seeking constitutional safeguards for the Assamese people). Our government will act as soon as the panel submits its recommendations,” he said.

Thousands of people have been carrying out protests demanding the withdrawal of the CAA which seeks to fast-track the citizenship of people from six religious groups who fled religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan till December 31, 2014.

201,2020/01/01,Political discussions fall silent as fear grips Varanasi,"The usual crowd at Pappu’s tea stall near Assi ghat chowk (intersection) of Varanasi was missing on December 28 — so was the intense discussion on political issues there. Just a few were sipping hot lemon tea but they were reluctant to speak on the burning issues of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) or National Register of Citizens.

“It’s not because of the cold wave but people in general here are apprehensive of coming out of their homes and indulging in political discussions”, they say. But why? “You know it better”, was the stock reply before even the few patrons beat a hasty retreat.

Many in Varanasi have learnt politics through lively debates and exchanging nuggets of information at this tea stall. The Banaras Hindu University is nearly two-km from the shop owned by Vishwanath Singh, aka “Pappu”, which elicits instant recognition. These days one of his four sons, Manoj Singh, manages the shop which has no sign board or offers no proper chairs or tables. Only two wooden benches occupy the place by the roadside. People used to stand for hours engaged in political or academic debate here.

A yellow tungsten bulb piercing the winter fog offers a little light. Noted Hindi writers Kashinath Singh, Balraj Pandey and Chowkiram Yadav were regular visitors and spent hours in discussion. Kashinath Singh’s famous novel Kashi ka Assi is based on everyday political discourse at this tea stall and the entire crew of popular Bollywood film Mohalla Assi has been here. It is said veteran socialist leader George Fernandes had once held a two-hour press conference over cups of tea at the stall when V.P. Singh was the Prime Minister.

“But, people, these days, are afraid of visiting Pappu’s tea shop and discussing politics…the very atmosphere is not conducive...everyone is suspicious of everyone”, Rajat Kumar, a student of BHU who on, December 24, refused to receive his Master’s degree in protest against CAA and NRC, told The Hindu while sipping lemon tea here. His friends Shantanu, Gaurav and Avinash too agreed with him. They have all been protesting against CAA and NRC.

“In the 365 days of 2019, Section 144 was imposed in Varanasi town for 359 days…how can one feel free and safe to speak one’s mind?”, asked Rajat.

“To hold any meeting or any function in any park of the city these days, one has to take permission from local RSS or BJP officials as they hold shakhas (daily-meetings) every morning there”, rued some residents of Adarsh Nagar locality of Mehmurganj. A prayer meeting for the safe release of all 54 anti-CAA and NRC protesters was organised on December 28 at the residence of retired irrigation department official Krishna Kumar Tiwari, whose son and daughter-in-law, Ravi and Ekta Shekhar, were among those arrested.

“On December 26, when we were meeting family members of the arrested persons at Bharat Mata temple, near Vidyapeeth, local police forced us to leave”, said BHU students Preyesh Pandey, Rajat, Aakash.

At a police outpost in Bajardiha locality, a large number of policemen were seen sitting by the roadside. “They can arrest anyone, anytime in the name of violating Section 144”, said local residents Mohd Imtiyaz and others. “It’s frightening these days to come outside and meet people”, they said.

People are really afraid to speak freely. “Well, the tenor of political discussions in Varanasi has changed after 2014...people do get fearful while expressing their opinion”, senior journalist A.K. Lari told The Hindu.

BHU professors Brinda Pranjape and M P Ahirwar too said the usual bonhomie in the University as well as the city has been “seriously threatened and throttled” after 2014. “After 2014 the colour of the city and University has become saffron…BHU now has become shelter home of Sanghis (RSS workers)”, they said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/62qzeg/article30453510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THRDBHU1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/political-discussions-fall-silent-as-fear-grips-varanasi/article30453511.ece
202,2020/01/01,Trinamool Congress observes ‘Citizens Day’,"Beginning the New Year on an offensive, the Trinamool Congress on Wednesday observed its 22nd Foundation Day as ‘Nagorik Dibas’ or Citizens Day.

“We are observing the foundation day of @AITCofficial as ‘Nagorik Dibas’ (Citizens Day) in every booth of #Bangla. We all are citizens and Trinamool will continue to fight for the rights of the people. Jai Hind. Jai Bangla ” Trinamool chairperson and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee tweeted.

The decision to observe the Foundation Day as Nagorik Dibas is politically significant as it comes at a time when the Trinamool has launched a sustained campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizen ( NRC). The Chief Minister is scheduled to visit north Bengal where she will hold rallies against the CAA later this week.

Ms. Banerjee added that her party has been steadfast in its resolve to fight for the people.“The journey which began on January 1, 1998 has been full of struggles, but we have been steadfast in our resolve to fight for the people. We thank maa, mati, manush for their constant support. Our workers are our biggest assets,” Ms. Banerjee said.

Earlier in the day, the Trinamool flag was unfurled at the party’s headquarters in Kolkata. Trinamool secretary general Subrata Bakshi, who presided over the programme, said the protest against the CAA is going to be the poll plank of the party in the next municipal polls in the State.

Commenting on the development, BJP State president Dilip Ghosh said the NRC was the “last straw” for the Trinamool chairperson and the party. “They are spreading fear about the NRC among the people and this is something they feel that will help them win elections,” he said.

A few days ago, Mr. Ghosh had gone back on his party claims of conducting the NRC exercise in West Bengal.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/eoe92h/article30446800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THMAMTABANERJEE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/trinamool-congress-observes-citizens-day/article30453455.ece
203,2020/01/01,Infant deaths in Rajasthan’s Kota rises to 100,"At least nine more infants have died in the last two days of December at the JK Lon hospital here, taking the death toll to 100 for the month, officials said on Wednesday.

The death of 10 children at the government-run hospital during a 48-hour period on December 23-24 had triggered opposition criticism and a visit by a team from the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).

Four children died on December 30 while five on December 31, all mainly due to low birth weight, hospital superintendent Dr. Suresh Dulara said.

Hospital authorities, however, said the number of deaths reported at the health facility in 2019 has witnessed decline since 2014 when 1,198 children died.

The nursing in-charge of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, which specialises in looking after premature and sick newborns, has been replaced, Dr. Dulara said.

Efforts for upgradation and maintenance of equipment at the hospital have been put in place, following directions by the Congress government in the State.

Medical College Principal Dr. Vijay Sardana said an order has been issued for installation of central oxygen supply line at the hospital and the work would be completed within 15 days.

BJP team visit

The direction was issued a day after a BJP parliamentary team comprising of MPs Locket Chatterjee, Kanta Kardam and Jaskaur Meena visited the hospital and expressed concern over its infrastructure.

The panel had said that two to three children were found on single beds and the hospital did not have enough nurses.

Dr. Sardana said the paediatric department at the health facility has been reconstructed, with its three units being functional in Jay Kay Lon hospital and a non-teaching unit working in New Medical College premises.

He said proposals for new OPD and emergency wards for paediatric and gynaecology departments have been incorporated in the proposed OPD Block under the Smart City Project.

Earlier, the NCPCR had served a show cause notice to the State government.

“Pigs were found roaming inside the campus of the hospital,” its chairperson Priyank Kanoongo had said.

205,2020/01/01,Newborn girl who suffered burns in Rajasthan hospital fire dies,"A newborn girl who was critically injured when a fire broke out in the neonatal care unit of a hospital in Rajasthan’s Alwar on Tuesday has succumbed to injuries, an official said on December 1.

The baby girl was admitted with 70% burn injuries at a Jaipur hospital and was on ventilator support.

There were 15 infants admitted to the neonatal care unit of the Geetanand hospital in Alwar when the fire broke out in an oxygen pipeline connected to a radiant warmer around 5 a.m. on Tuesday.

The girl, who was being treated for pneumonia, had burn injuries on her face, chest and shoulder, while others were shifted to other units, an official had said.

“The girl has died today,” J.K. Lon hospital superintendent Ashok Gupta said.

Meanwhile, a three-member committee, headed by the health department’s joint director, found negligence on part of the unit incharge and nursing incharge of the hospital.

“Sparking occurred in the panel of radiant warmer due to high voltage. It led to fire in the hood of oxygen pipe,” Alwar Chief Medical and Health Officer O.P. Meena said. “The panel was not properly maintained and the unit incharge and nursing incharge are responsible for that.”

206,2020/01/01,Jammu & Kashmir High Court withdraws notification for filling up district court vacancies on pan-India basis,"The Lieutenant Governor’s administration has rejected the Public Service Commission (PSC) recommendations on recruitment for the new Union Territory (UT) of Jammu & Kashmir, as the High Court on Wednesday withdrew notices allowing outsiders to apply for posts here.

The recommendations of PSC chairman Latief-u-Zaman Deva, accessed by The Hindu, showed that the UT’s top hiring agency with mandate to formulate recruitment and promotion policy had suggested “separate employment policy” for J&K. The commission, retained in the J&K Reorganisation Act, was made inoperational for unknown reasons on October 31.

The PSC, headed by Mr. Deva then, had suggested that local language test should be made mandatory for all those applying for jobs in J&K. It argued that recruiting outsiders without knowledge of the local languages “will impact functioning of the departments, especially the education department.”

The commission also recommended that only those who have been living is J&K for at least 15 years should be made eligible for jobs.

In a place where government is the biggest recruitment agency, the recent advertisements of posts by the High Court, allowing outsiders to apply, evoked sharp reactions in Jammu’s Hindu belt.

The growing anger, even within the saffron and regional parties in Jammu, forced the authorities to withdraw the notices to throw open jobs to outsiders.

“[Advertisements for] Applications invited for different posts in non-gazetted category in the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir stand withdrawn with immediate effect,” High Court registrar Sanjay Dhar said. Around 55 vacancies had been notified.

There has been no reaction from the Kashmir Valley.

J&K National Panthers Party chairman Harsh Dev Singh told The Hindu that the High Court decision was a “welcome move.”

“The jobs in J&K need to be restricted to local youth. And the government needs to come out with constitutional safeguards in this regard. The NPP is already fighting for safeguarding the interests of local youth. We had even submitted a memo in this regard in the Prime Minister's Office,” said Mr. Singh.

Sources said top BJP leaders in Jammu on Wednesday held meetings with party workers and informed them that the BJP will also push for safeguarding the job and land rights of locals.

Earlier, BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav categorically denied any proposal to extend Article 371, which creates special provisions for locals in jobs and land, to J&K.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/192zkj/article30282095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NorthIndia1FrGP86R9B2D3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jk-hc-withdraws-notification-for-filling-up-district-court-vacancies-on-pan-india-basis/article30450414.ece
207,2020/01/01,Govt deallocates coal block in Jharkhand allotted for power project,"The government has cancelled the allotment of a coal block for the power project in Jharkhand, as even after a decade of allotment no significant progress was made to operationalise it.

The coal block was allotted in 2009, to Karanpura Energy Ltd -- an SPV of erstwhile Jharkhand State Electricity Board (JSEB).

“It is noted that even after lapse of 10 years since allocation of the coal block (Mourya coal block), no significant progress has been made to operationalise the coal block,” the coal ministry said in a letter to the company.

Due to long delays in development of coal block, show cause notices were served by the coal ministry to the company in December 2013, and September and October, 2019.

The company in its reply to the ministry in November, 2019 cited non-availability of land, water and resistance from the local inhabitants as impediments in development of the coal block.

The coal ministry, however, said that the reply “was not found satisfactory“.

As per the allocation letter, the ministry said, the mining lease of the block may be cancelled on the grounds, including unsatisfactory progress in the development of coal mining project and breach of any of the conditions of allocation.

In 2009, the ministry had conveyed ‘in principle’ approval to the working of Mourya coal block, in the state of Jharkhand, for power project to be set up by Karanpura Energy Ltd.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gmsbdm/article30449581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01COALINJHARKHAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/govt-deallocates-coal-block-in-jharkhand-allotted-for-power-project/article30449582.ece

No untoward incident was reported throughout the day.

Violent protests erupted on the occasion on January 1, 2018.

Heavy security

Earlier in the day, Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) president Prakash Ambedkar, Union Minister Ramdas Athawale and several other leaders visited the ‘Jay Stambh’.

Mr. Ambedkar claimed that certain people, who were attempting to politicise the Bhima-Koregaon battle celebrations, had intended to spark riots this time as well, but the move was foiled by his party along with the parties of the newly established Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.

“Due to the transformed political scenario today, the people who were behind the 2018 riots and who were shielded by the then government, find themselves in a position when that government [erstwhile BJP] government is no longer in power,” Mr. Ambedkar said.

Speaking to reporters after visiting the victory pillar, Mr. Pawar said: “This pillar has a rich history and every year lakhs of people come here ... Some untoward incidents marred the celebrations two years ago, but the present government is taking utmost care and a massive security deployment is in place to prevent any law and order situation.”

Long history

The Bhima Koregaon obelisk is dedicated to the Mahar soldiers who fought against the Peshwa forces in the 1818 battle.

While the outcome of the battle was inconclusive, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s visit to there on January 1, 1927, revitalised its memory for the Dalit community, making it a rallying point and an assertion of pride.

A police officer, however, said they were selling their products at a no-vending zone and the restrictions were due to the security arrangements made during New Year’s time.

Traders from J&K travel to the U.P. capital each year at the onset of winter to sell dry fruits and shawls.

210,2020/01/01,"Odisha tribals still suffering from hunger, malnutrition","Right to Food Campaign, a platform of social activists, said poor implementation of government welfare programmes was marginalising tribals further in backward pockets of Odisha.

In the wake of malnutrition deaths of 20 infants of the Juanga tribe at Nagada village in Jajpur district in 2016, the RTF campaigners started visiting villages inhabited by particularly vulnerable tribal groups in different parts of the State.

As per the findings shared by RTF members, Paudi Bhuyan tribes in four villages – Kiri, Keta, Kundula and Kunu – under Bonai subdivision of Sundargarh districts were suffering from hunger and malnutrition.

“Integrated Child Development Service programme, one of the most important food security programmes, was found non-existent in Paudi Bhuyan tribal villages. Anganwadi centres were non-functional. No ICDS authority has visited these villages in two decades. Children were never immunised. They were also not getting cooked food,” alleged Pradip Pradhan, convenor of RTF Campaign, who led the team.

‘No payment’

Under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 21 tribals of these villages had worked in a road construction work in 2014, but they had not got their payments, said Mr. Pradhan.

Paudi Bhuyan, one of the most vulnerable and neglected tribes who reside on hilltops, should be mainstreamed and linked with government welfare programmes immediately, RTF campaigners recommended.

212,2020/01/01,Arunachal MLAs trek 4 days to survey for mountain road,"An Arunachal Pradesh Minister and two legislators literally walked across an eastern Himalayan mountain to raise hopes for turning a century-old porter track into a road.

Talem Taboh and Kanggong Taku have a few things in common. They are both Janata Dal (United) MLAs and represent adjoining constituencies — Rumgong in Siang district and Mariyang-Geku in Upper Siang district respectively.

They have also been engineers in the State’s Rural Works Department that undertakes rural infrastructure projects, including roads.

Their engineering background made them plan, along with the State Health Minister Alo Libang, an expedition across the Luyor mountain straddling their Assembly constituencies.

“The objective of the expedition was to put our engineering experience to survey for a road that has eluded 11 villages along the old porter track for decades. It is difficult to say how many miles we covered on the high mountain, but it took us four days one way from December 22-25,” Mr Taku told The Hindu on Tuesday.

The team also included a few Border Roads Organisation and other government officials and some porters. Their four-day trek from Molo village in Siang district ended in Miging village in Upper Siang district.

Mr. Taku said the trip made them realise the hardship the people faced. “This padayatra was necessary for obtaining first-hand knowledge of the local problems for resolving them accordingly,” he added.

The team spent the nights either in a village or in tents.

At Payum, one of the villages that the team mapped, former panchayat member Tamang Tachung said lack of road, telecommunication, electricity and other basic amenities made more than half the 50 families migrate to Kaying village that is better connected.

Moved elsewhere

“Most of those who stayed behind are the elderly people who have nowhere else to go,” said Mr. Tachung.

The inhabitants of Gasheng village had a similar tale to tell. Locals said more than 200 families have moved to urban areas because of acute hardship.

213,2020/01/01,"Technology, strategy and politics saved the day for Mamata in 2019","When the entire anti-BJP Opposition at the national level came together in a mega rally in Kolkata in the January of 2019, it appeared that the united 20-party Opposition would be able to prop up a serious challenge to the BJP in West Bengal. But in the following month, PM Narendra Modi stepped up his party’s campaign in the State. The Trinamool Congress incurred its worst ever defeat — winning 12 seats less than in 2014. It was a setback since Mamata Banerjee and the TMC came to power in 2011.

The TMC appeared all over the place as its chief appeared confused. She was literally threatening pranksters shouting ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogans at her.

Damp squib

Cornered by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate, which was even chasing her trusted bureaucrat Rajeev Kumar, the former Police Commissioner of Kolkata, Ms. Banerjee went on a sit-in, which was a damp squib. She realised that the CBI-ED net is closing in on her and the heir apparent Abhisekh Banerjee, MP and her nephew. The TMC chief did admit that she focused on governance and lost the script. “Now I will focus on organisation more [than government],” a belligerent Ms. Banerjee said.

Moreover, almost every other day, a district level leader was leaving the TMC to join the BJP, taking along with them majority of civic body members, and the BJP leaders predicted a mid-term election by the end of the year.

This is when Abhisekh, who is still considered a greenhorn in Bengal politics, made a move which perhaps rescued Ms. Banerjee, at least in 2019. He spoke to political strategist Prashant Kishor and — if the TMC leaders are to be believed — managed to convince his aunt that the party needs a person who understands the connection between technology, strategy and politics.

Didi decided to bring in Mr. Kishor, who gave a face-lift to Ms. Banerjee’s public persona, a difficult feat.

In the first place — and for the first time in her career — Ms. Banerjee started talking less. She, in fact, started looking at notes in front of her while addressing press conferences. Secondly, she not only stopped reacting to slogans, but also stopped reacting altogether to minor allegations, which reduced sound and fury around her. Unlike earlier years, she now rarely retaliates to the Governor’s criticisms.

Thirdly, she stopped targeting the Prime Minister or individuals, and rather targeted the BJP as a party. Fourthly, Ms. Banerjee calibrated her anti-BJP campaigns according to the requirement of the hour. For example, she did not step up campaigns against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or the National Register of Citizens, till she realised it was swelling. In earlier case, like the one on the Rafale deal or demonetisation, Ms. Banerjee was way more vocal than others from the beginning. The TMC also managed to plug the defections to BJP.

Importantly, Ms. Banerjee met Prime Minister and Home Minister which confused the ruling party and the Opposition in the State. However, she is yet to convince her leaders and cadres to reduce infighting and to stop misbehaving with people.

On the other hand, the BJP did not fare too badly. It managed to resist the TMC in villages where the elections are fought and won. Many of its grassroot level workers were targeted and even killed, but the party and the affiliated organisations did not give up the challenge. Though party cadre and the leaders acknowledge, albeit off the record, that thrust on implementation of NRC has damaged the BJP in Bengal.

The man who always advocated for NRC, party’s State president Dilip Ghosh, sounded little bemused at the end of 2019. However, 2019 has been a good year for Mr. Ghosh when he was elected an MP and emerged as the face of the party in the State.

However, one factor has severely hurt the BJP in Bengal – complete indecision on whether to get more and more TMC cadres or to put an end to it.

In this backdrop, the TMC and the BJP are stepping into the new year, raring to launch at each other. Civic polls, a year before the Assembly elections, will indicate the direction of the wind.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3ayita/article30296785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAMATABANERJEE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/technology-strategy-and-politics-saved-the-day-for-mamata-in-2019/article30447308.ece

216,2020/01/01,Sena bags Aurangabad Deputy Mayor post,"The changed political equations in the State reflected in the Aurangabad Deputy Mayor election on Tuesday, with the Shiv Sena’s Rajendra Janjal emerging victorious with the support of the Congress and the National Congress Party (NCP).

Mr. Janjal’s win extended the Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition formula to the municipal level with the aim to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power in local bodies at any cost.

The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), where the Sena and BJP had jointly shared power for nearly 15 years, now has an MVA coalition with the Sena holding the posts of Mayor (Nandkumar Ghodele) and Deputy Mayor.

Mr. Janjal secured 51 votes, while the BJP-backed Independent Gokulsingh Malke won 34 votes. Zafar Khan of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) secured a mere 13 votes, despite the AIMIM being the second-largest party in the AMC.

The Sena is the largest party in the 115-seat House with 29 corporators, while the AIMIM has 24. The BJP has 23, while the Congress and NCP have 11 and four respectively.

Breaking point

Despite the Sena and the BJP sharing power for a considerable period in the AMC, the estrangement of the two saffron allies at the Centre and in the State has changed the arrangement.

The final rift between the two parties in the Aurangabad occurred on December 13 after deputy mayor and BJP leader Vijay Autade resigned over a proposal moved by Sena corporators to felicitate Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. Mr. Autade had also claimed that the MVA government had halted the water supply scheme meant for Aurangabad sanctioned by former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.

Earlier on Monday, senior Pune Congress leader Mohan Joshi had instructed Bhausaheb Jagtap, the Congress’s group leader in the AMC, to ensure that all party corporators voted for the Sena’s candidate.

“It is the policy of the State Congress leadership to ensure that the socially divisive BJP is kept out of power at the local body level, be they civic body polls or zilla parishad elections. Hence, we have supported the Shiv Sena in Aurangabad in keeping with the MVA formula,” Mr. Joshi said.

He said similar tactics had helped win the day for the MVA in the Ahmednagar zilla parishad elections on Tuesday, which saw the NCP and the Congress ending the sway of Congressman-turned-BJP leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil in the ZP.

AIMIM suspension

Meanwhile, the AIMIM said it will suspend some of its corporators for not voting for the party candidate. “Five of them were absent for voting while some have cross-voted. The party will accordingly be charging them with anti-party activities,” said Aurangabad MP Imtiaz Jaleel, who is also the AIMIM State president.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sena-bags-aurangabad-deputy-mayor-post/article30446743.ece
217,2020/01/01,Artist Sanjeev Rao Guthi paints a picture of power struggles,"As you enter the small room on the second floor of Apparao Galleries, a giant thousand-rupee note welcomes you. On the note are a few people running, with stars on their heads and balloons in their hands. Mahatma Gandhi, on the note, is laughing at the gimmicks. This work, by artist Sanjeev Rao Guthi, speaks volumes about the power struggles that dominate society today.

At a time when man’s penchant for money and power is at its highest, the exhibition by Sanjeev Rao Guthi, titled Unpredictable Probabilities, becomes relevant. The stars on the heads of the people in the giant note are a symbol of power; the balloons they carry can burst any time. It is a reminder that power is not eternal.

On moving further into the display, a colourful painting calls for attention. Many people are moving on a bike with their belongings. They are migrating, and are in search of better lives. The bike is symbolic of the journey of life. Sanjeev says, “If you have money, you are respected.” His paintings are reflective of what he reads, sees, listens to and experiences in his daily life. It is the medium through which he responds.

Sanjeev has been working on this series of paintings for the last one year — watercolour is his medium of choice. The idea for this series emerged from the changing nature of human behaviour that had caught his attention lately. He points out that humanity is hardly present in the world today.

Though his paintings reflect struggles, they are colourful. He justifies this by saying, “Life offers different challenges to different people. The way these challenges are approached and resolved, also differs. So the different shades represent plurality.” He also adds that the people are all in brightly coloured dresses, to convey how an individual attempts to emphasise himself. It tells how man considers himself the most important, in society.

Quite interestingly, one finds a lot of zebras in his paintings. Here he employs satire to reach his audience. Zebras, according to Sanjeev, “are beautiful donkeys.” They work hard, not realising what they are working for.

In addition to this series, the exhibition also carries a few paintings by Laxma Goud and T Vaikuntam.

Unpredictable Probabilities is open to public at Apparao Galleries, Nungambakkam, till January 10.

223,2020/01/01,Model code delays Corpn. works,"The State Election Commission imposing the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) to conduct rural local body polls has had its impact on the Coimbatore Corporation, an urban local body.

The Corporation had been unable to float tenders for three projects worth ₹ 121 crore, said officials.

The civic body had wanted to float tenders to select bidders to execute the Kurichi tank development and beautification project for ₹ 52 crore, bio-mine the accumulated waste in Vellalore for ₹ 61 crore and clean and conserve the Narasampathy tank for ₹ 9 crore.

It had sent the tender documents to the Department of Information and Public Relations, but the latter had expressed its inability to publish them saying that it was bound by the MCC.

In its communication to the Corporation, the Department said that though the Corporation was an urban local body, the tenders published on newspapers would also reach voters in rural areas, where the MCC was in force.

Therefore, only after the declaration of the results of the local body polls and the lift of MCC would it be able to publish the tender documents, it said.

This, the Corporation said, had delayed the execution of projects by a month.

224,2020/01/01,Corporation hopes to complete work on Nanjundapuram STP by December 2020,"Nearly one-third of the work in the construction of the sewage treatment plant (STP) in Nanjundapuram is complete, says the Coimbatore Corporation.

Legal issue

The Corporation began the construction sometime in August-September this year for the ₹ 43.60-crore project, which was delayed because of it entering into a legal tangle with two residents’ welfare association.

The long drawn out battle saw it lose precious time and a part of the resources it had invested. By the time it emerged out of the battle, it had spent around ₹ 17 crore of the proposed investment of ₹ 33.79 crore.

The Corporation then engaged an expert team to assess how much of the investment it could salvage, what modifications were necessary for those and what it needed to add to comply with the National Green Tribunal order.

The Corporation says it is rising the height of the compound on the north and east of the 6.24-acre site, installing high-power diesel generators, shifting two of the several tanks used in treating the waste and equipping the plant with the devices necessary to continuously transmit to the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board headquarters the air quality data from the site.

Trial run

The work is progressing as per schedule and by December 2020, the Corporation hopes to take the plant to the trial-run stage.

The Corporation commissioning the plant does not mean immediate availability of the underground sewer service to one-third of the city’s residents.

Connections

It says once the plant is ready for commercial run, it will then have to start giving house service connections to the residents of those wards who will be serviced by the Nanjundapuram treatment plant.

As per the Corporation’s underground drainage project proposal, the Nanjundapuram plant will serve nearly 20,000 residents in Ramanathapuram, Pappanaickenpudur, Avarampalayam, Gandhipuram, Ganapathy, Sanganoor and a few other areas.

This work, the Corporation estimates, will take a year or more and perhaps by 2021 the residents will get to benefit from the underground sewer service.

The Corporation took up the underground drainage project at around ₹ 120 crore in 2011 under the then Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tdu6qc/article30447106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB01STP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporation-hopes-to-complete-work-on-nanjundapuram-stp-by-december-2020/article30447107.ece
225,2020/01/01,Coimbatore industries look forward to revival measures in 2020,"Coimbatore’s manufacturing sector took a beating in the last one year, leading to unutilised capacities, job losses, and financial stress. As a new year dawns, the industry hopes for measures from the government for demand to revive.

For most of the sectors, the first six months went off relatively well. Things started getting worse from July, say industry association heads here. The general economic slowdown, unseasonal rain affecting crops, drop in market, and lack of stability in policies have all affected the industry, sources say.

Since June-July, it was not just the automobile sector, but many other sectors that started seeing a slowdown. It has affected jobs and working capital availability for industries, especially the Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs), says R. Ramamurthy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association.

“The MSMEs in Coimbatore are facing 30 % to 40 % slowdown and nearly 40 % capacities remain unutilised. We are unable to meet the overheads,” he says.

Coimbatore supplies nearly 40 % of the country’s pumpsets, mainly in the agricultural and domestic sectors, and the pumpset industry usually sees good demand from States such as Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh during November -December. This year, unseasonal and excess rain affected crops and demand dropped drastically in the third quarter, says V. Krishnakumar, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association.

The market in the southern States picks up after Pongal. But the demand starts in the northern markets earlier. That has not happened this year, he says.

Rain, hail storms, political disturbances, and slowdown in the construction sector have all affected the pumpset industry.

In the case of textiles, “the year 2019 was a challenging one for the Indian textile and clothing industry, especially the spinning sector, due to steep fall in cotton yarn exports,” according to Southern India Mills’ Association (SIMA). Majority of the textile mills had to cut down production and face an unprecedented crisis, the Association said.

Export of cotton yarn declined 37 % between April and October this year compared to the corresponding period last year. While the country used to export on an average 120 million kg of cotton yarn a month in 2013-14, it is just half that volume now. It is not just yarn, but export of cotton fabrics and made ups reduced 2 % and that of man made yarn, fabric and made ups, and ready-made garments all registered 5 % and 3 % negative growth respectively. The industry is concerned as imports of fabrics and MMF ready-made garments have increased during the same period.

According to J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, the year 2019 was one of the worst for the micro units as every bigger factory that gives job orders to these units insist that the unit should have GST registration.

The micro units continue to demand total exemption from GST, he says.

However, data available with the District Lead Bank shows that bank advances in the district registered growth in the first six months this year.

Between April and December 2018, the banks lent ₹69,650 crore. This year, between April and September, the banks had lent ₹72, 387 crore. Bank credit flow to MSMEs between April and December last year was ₹17,317 crore and this year, from April to September, it was ₹17,579 crore.

Higher advances could be because the industry is stressed and borrowed more, says Mr. Ramamurthy. Further, some industries would have invested in the first two quarters and the capacities are lying idle now, he says.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s announcement on Tuesday related to ₹102 lakh crore national infrastructure funding should be implemented at the earliest. The government should start executing its projects so that the demand revives, he says.

The SIMA says that any policy should remain stable for three to five years to enable ease of doing business. Further, all export-related refunds should be disbursed without delay so that the industry does not face financial crunch.

Industry sources say unless there are immediate measures from the government in the next three months, the industry will face a tough situation next year too.

The government should focus on reviving demand, implement the policies it has announced and help the industry grow, they say.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/h0e8pt/article30447103.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB01CITYMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-industries-look-forward-to-revival-measures-in-2020/article30447104.ece

228,2020/01/01,Road fatalities decrease by more than half in 2019 in the Nilgiris,"The number of road fatalities in the Nilgiris has halved in 2019 when compared with the previous year, due to stricter penalties for motorists found breaking the law, and restrictions being imposed on vehicles descending via the Kalhatty Ghat Road.

Deaths

According to statistics released by the Nilgiris district police, the number of fatalities declined from 28 reported deaths in 2018 to 13 this year, while the number of accidents that led to non-fatal injuries too reduced, from 228 last year to 157 this year. However, the number of people injured in these accidents has increased from 200 to 308 this year, officials said, adding that the majority of the injuries were minor.

The Nilgiris district Superintendent of Police, V. Sasi Mohan, said that furthermore, the number of fatalities along the Kalhatty Ghat Road, one of the Nilgiris’ most accident-prone stretches , had been brought down to zero this year due to restrictions placed on traffic, with cars and vehicles from outside the Nilgiris being prevented from using the road to descend to the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.

The statistics further reveals that on an average, six people died and 34 people were injured each year since 2014 along the ghat road till 2018. However, these figures have plummeted due to better regulation of traffic along the stretch in 2019.

Officials said that in 2019, 84,687 cases were registered against motorcyclists for not wearing helmets, 1,794 drunkdriving cases and 2,764 cases for speeding.

229,2020/01/01,Micro units seek time to pay GST dues,"The Coimbatore and Tiruppur Districts Tiny and Micro Enterprises Association (COTMA) has appealed to the GST Commissionerate to give six months time for micro units to pay the GST dues.

Memorandum

The association’s office-bearers submitted a memorandum on Monday to Rajesh Sodhi, Principal Commissioner of the GST Commissionerate here. They said the micro and cottage industries, numbering over 50,000 in the district, mostly do job orders for bigger units. The GST on these units was reduced from 18 % to 12 % recently.

The bigger units pay the job work amount to the micro units after 120 days or even 150 days. However, the units should pay the GST regularly. The association has been demanding the Government to insist on the bigger units to make payments to the vendors in 45 days. If the micro units do not pay the GST for six months, the registration is suspended and when they clear the dues, the registration is revoked after a month or two.

230,2020/01/01,New Year celebrations throw traffic out of gear in Delhi,"Massive traffic snarls were witnessed in Delhi on Wednesday as scores of people flocked to India Gate and Connaught Place for New Year celebrations.

Entry and exit gates of five Delhi Metro stations were closed in the evening to ease the rush of passengers.

The Delhi Traffic Police have been constantly alerting commuters about vehicular traffic through its official handle on Twitter to avoid any inconvenience.

Commuters were stuck in traffic jams on roads leading to India Gate, Connaught Place and ITO.

“Entry & exit gates of Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan, Pragati Maidan, Khan Market and Mandi House are closed. Interchange is available at Central Secretariat and Mandi House,” the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) tweeted.

The police said traffic was heavy around India Gate and C-Hexagon due to visitors and a heavy volume of motorists.

It advised people coming from Noida to take DND or Akshardham to reach Delhi since road No.13A between Mathura Road and Kalindi Kunj was closed for traffic movement.

Vehicular movement was affected in north Delhi due to the breakdown of a truck on Prembari flyover, officials said.

“Traffic movement is closed on Jai Singh road from Ashok road side due to heavy volume of vehicles,” the Delhi Traffic Police said in a tweet.

“Traffic will remain heavy from Raja Garden towards Punjabi Bagh due to ongoing work by PWD.

231,2020/01/01,"Javadekar blames AAP, Congress for violent protests against CAA in Delhi; both parties hit back","The ongoing blame game between rivals in the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls over a host of issues intensified on Wednesday with BJP leader Prakash Javadekar holding the AAP and Congress “responsible” for violent protests in the city against the amended citizenship law.

The AAP and Congress leaders “misled” people and “incited” them for violence during protests against CAA in the city, alleged Mr. Javadekar who is incharge of Delhi BJP for the Assembly polls.

He said both parties should apologise to the people of the city.

The AAP and Congress rubbished Javadekar’s charges and hit back at the BJP.

“Aam Aadmi Party and Congress are responsible for the violence during Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in Delhi. Both the parties did not condemn violence in the country and their people incited it,” Mr. Javadekar said at a press conference.

He named leaders of AAP and Congress in connection with violence at Jamia, Daryaganj and Seelampur areas during violent protests over the amended citizenship law in the city last month.

“In Jamia violence, Congress leader Asif Khan and AAP MLA Amantullah have been accused of inciting people. Congress’s Chaudhary Mateen Ahamad and AAP MLA Ishraq Khan and councilor Abdul Rahman in Seelamnagar, and Congress leader Mahmood Pracha in connection with Daryaganj violence, are either accused or facing investigation,” said the Union minister.

Senior AAP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said BJP was trying to divert people’s attention from real issues by making such allegations.

“AAP completely opposes riots (violence) and we all know which party indulges in it. The masters of riots are accusing others and trying to distract attention of people from real issues,” he said.

Mr. Javadekar also blamed AAP’s Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan of giving a speech and misleading people over the citizenship law by claiming that the rights of Muslims will be curtailed.

“Amanatullah Khan gave a riot inciting speech, claiming CAA will lead to ban on burqa, loudspeakers at mosques, cap and beard...but where is the relation. It(CAA) is a law to provide citizenship to religiously persecuted minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan,” he claimed.

Mr. Sisodia said Mr. Javadekar was playing an old tune in view of Delhi Assembly polls due this year.

“It is an old tape that BJP has played earlier also and it is playing the same old tape again through a new tape recorder. Javadekar should understand that Delhi elections would not be fought on the old tapes but on real issues like education,” Mr. Sisodia said.

Delhi Congress chief spokesperson Mukesh Sharma termed Javadekar’s charges as “baseless” and a “drama” in the wake of elections.

“Congress believes CAA has terrified a large section of Delhi people over citizenship issues. We will not be deflected by such baseless allegations and continue to peacefully protest against the amended citizenship law,” Mr. Sharma said.

Mr. Javadekar claimed that there is peace in the country now after violent protests because people have realised the truth behind rumours related to CAA.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/zhir3u/article30363704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-jacob-NRC-jaG466SJ6SC3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/javadekar-blames-aap-congress-for-violent-protests-against-caa-in-delhi-both-parties-hit-back/article30452599.ece

238,2020/01/01,Marginal rise in Delhi’s forest cover,"Forest cover in the Capital increased by three square kilometres from the previous assessment, according to the biennial India State of Forest Report (ISFR), which was made public on Monday.

The latest estimate is based on the satellite imagery of November 2017. The previous assessment was in October-December 2015.

The total forest cover of Delhi is 195.44 sq km, which is 13.18% of the National Capital Territory’s area. About 6.72 square kilometre of this is classified as Very Dense Forest (VDF) or possessing trees with a canopy density of greater than 70%, 56.42 sq km is moderately dense forest and 132 sq km is ‘open forest.’ About 136 sq km of the forest cover is in south and south-west Delhi.

Trees outside forest constituted about 129 sq km, an increase from 113 sq km.

The total carbon stock of forest in the State is 1.25 million tons which is 0.017% of the country’s carbon stock. During the assessment, the officials recorded 16 tree species, 11 shrubs and 36 herbs and much of the forest is classified as ‘tropical dry deciduous forest.’

The dominant tree species outside of forests mainly include prosopis juliflora, azadirachta indica, morus species and eucalyptus, which are exotic varieties.

The ISFR 2019 revealed that forest cover in India increased by 3,976 square kilometres (sq km) but with a sharp decline in the north-eastern States of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Mizoram. At 712,249 sq km, India’s forest cover constituted 21.67% of geographical area or 0.12% more than last year.

239,2020/01/01,"After three days of ‘severe’ air quality, some relief for residents","The air quality of the city slightly improved to the upper end of “very poor” category on Tuesday and is likely to further improve over the week, according to government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).

The AQI on Tuesday was in “very poor” category, which is still high, due to “moderate” surface wind speed and low mixing height. Fast surface winds blow away the pollutants and high mixing height will provide more area for pollutants to spread out and thus decrease air pollution.

On Tuesday, the average level of PM2.5 — deadly respirable particles, which is a chief pollutant — was (183.6ug/m3) more than three times the safe limit (60ug/m3) as per Indian standards in Delhi and NCR at 7 p.m., according to the CPCB. But the level is more than seven times the safe limit (25 ug/m3) set by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

The city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) on Tuesday was 387 (very poor), down from Monday’s 446 (severe), according to the 4 p.m. bulletin of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which is the average of the last 24 hours.

“AQI is forecast to improve to the middle-end of the very poor category on New Year day. Further significant improvement in AQI towards the lower-end of very poor to poor category is expected by January 2,” SAFAR said.

Pollution hotspots

Wednesday’s top three air pollution hotspots of Delhi are likely to be Badarpur, AIIMS/Adarshnagar and Rohini.

“Under the influence of approaching western disturbance, isolated rainfall is likely over Delhi by the weekend and significant improvement in AQI is expected,” according to SAFAR.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4n36cp/article30447318.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEAQI-01-01-2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/after-three-days-of-severe-air-quality-some-relief-for-residents/article30447319.ece
240,2020/01/01,Capital basks in sunshine after easterly winds blow away fog,"Delhi recorded its second coldest winter spell since 1901 with the mean maximum temperature (MMT) for December at 18.76 degrees Celsius. The coldest ever has been 17.3 degrees Celsius recorded in December 1997.

The mean maximum temperature for December has remained equal to or less than 20 degrees Celsius only four times — 1919, 1929, 1961 and 1997, said MeT officials.

After recording its coldest day at 9.4 degrees Celsius on Monday, the sun was out in the Capital on Tuesday morning with the maximum temperature settling at 14.6 degrees Celsius.

With this, December has recorded 18 consecutive ‘cold days’, the maximum after 17 cold days in December 1997. After 1992, Delhi has had cold spells only in four years - 1997, 1998, 2003 and 2014.

It was a windy day on Tuesday with easterly winds gusting up to 15 km/ph blowing away the fog that had engulfed the Capital, bringing some relief from the cold wave. The minimum temperature settled at 4.8 degrees Celsius at the Safdarjung observatory, two notches below the season’s average, and humidity was 91%. The minimum temperature at Palam was recorded at 4.1 degrees Celsius, Lodhi Road at 3.7 degrees Celsius while at Ayanagar it was recorded at 4.2 degrees Celsius.

While parts of national capital witnessed shallow to moderate fog, the operations at Delhi airport were normal and no flights were delayed or cancelled.

On Monday, the Capital was enveloped in a thick blanket of fog with visibility at Delhi airport falling to nil for several hours. Normal operations were suspended leaving passengers stranded for several hours due to cancellations and diversions.

The forecast shows that there will be very light rain in the city on January 2 and the city will have some respite from the cold till January 4.

241,2020/01/01,First 20-25 registries likely to be handed over in 2-3 days: DDA,"Senior officials of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on Tuesday said that the urban body is currently processing the “complete applications” received for grant of ownership to residents of unauthorised colonies and that around 20-25 residents will be granted ownership in the “next two to three days.”

As of December 31, the urban body had received around 40 complete applications on the portal which was launched by the DDA on December 16, senior officials said. The total number of registrations received on the portal is approximately 50,000, officials said.

“Registering on the portal is only the first step. Residents need to then provide the geo-cooridnates to be able to proceed on the application further following which the DDA will conduct verification of relevant documents and so on. The grant of ownership can only happen once the complete applications are received and it is up to the stakeholders as to when they finish the process,” a senior official explained.

The official added, “As soon as the verification is completed, conveyance deeds for government land and authorisation slips for private land will be given out to grant ownership rights to the residents. As of now we can see around 20-25 applications, registries for which should be given out in another two to three days.”

With the Delhi Assembly polls round the corner housing, mainly for the urban poor, has emerged to be a major poll plank.

Earlier this week, the Aam Aadmi Party had called the Centre’s promise of “regularisation” of the unauthorised colonies, a “blatant lie.”

However, Union Minister Hardeep Puri said that the FAQs (frequently asked questions) pertaining to the question of whether regularisation of the colonies will be done under the PM-UDAY (PM- Unauthorised colonies in Delhi Awas Adhikar Yojana) on the DDA’s website had been updated.

“Things have been simplified on the DDA website to convince them (AAP leaders),” Mr. Puri said.

Reacting to criticism from the AAP, Mr. Puri said the ownership rights would lead to immediate benefits to the residents, while regularisation can take up to 10 years. He said usually ownership rights are given after regularisation.

Referring to Congress-era regularisation, he said: “312 colonies were regularised in 2012. What happened then? Nothing.”

He added that the grant of ownership rights would lead to addition of 10 lakh houses as people would be able to secure loans and build further. He added that funds for social infrastructure could be spent on these colonies.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/845jlf/article30447311.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1DEILLEGAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/first-20-25-registries-likely-to-be-handed-over-in-2-3-days-dda/article30447312.ece

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Sisodia said that the decision was taken by the Naming Committee of the Delhi government on Tuesday and the changes will reflect in the Delhi Metro’s systems in about a month’s time.

“The Naming Committee decided to name Mukarba Chowk and flyover after Shaheed Captain Vikram Batra and Mehrauli Badarpur Road after Acharya Shri Mahapragya,” he said.

Other changes

Delhi government also changed the following names: Lajpat Nagar Flyover to Sri Jhoole Lal Setu and Shakti Nagar Chowk to Bhagwan Mahavir Chowk.

The Deputy Chief Minister said that Mukarba Chowk was an important junction and naming the chowk as well as the flyover after Shaheed Captain Vikram Batra, who was martyred in the Kargil War in 1999, can inspire the people of Delhi and those who come to Delhi. “A few months ago, the parents of Shaheed Captain Vikram Batra visited Delhi and requested to honour the martyr. This decision is a deserving tribute to him,” he added.

About the metro station, he said that the demand to change the name was made by the Supreme Court in September 2019. “The request to change the Mehrauli Badarpur Road to Acharya Shri Mahapragya was initiated by people nearby and various organisations,” said the Deputy Chief Minister.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/r0ksxd/article30380676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHIMETROTRAINTRIALRUNLAJPATNAGARSG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pragati-maidan-renamed-supreme-court-metro-station/article30447306.ece

The DJB also said it will levy a penalty on consumers with a plot size of 500 square metres or more and whose water bills are up by 1.5 times for not implementing rainwater harvesting system.

The Jal Board, in its affidavit filed before the High Court, said 11,958 consumers have been penalised and an amount of ₹56.71 crore imposed as penalty between July 1, 2017 and August 2019. On the other hand, 1,559 consumers have also been provided rebate for installing functional rainwater harvesting system.

To promote implementation of rainwater harvesting, Jal Board gives 10% rebate in water bills for plot size of 100 square metres and above for having adequate and functional rainwater harvesting systems.

The submission of the Board came while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) initiated by the High Court on its own to improve the groundwater condition in Delhi.

Taking note of the submission of the Jal Board, a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar said there was no reason for it to further monitor the case.

It, however, remarked that the provision for “rainwater harvesting” in the Master Plan for Delhi-2021 and Unified Building Bye-Laws for Delhi- 2016 will be “scrupulously followed” and in case of any violation, action will be initiated against the erring persons in accordance with law.

Growing water demands

In the affidavit, the Jal Board said that “groundwater resource in Delhi is overstressed to meet its ever growing water demands”.

“Construction of three upstream storages on the Yamuna and its tributaries in time-bound manner are of utmost importance to meet drinking water requirements of Delhi and to reduce dependence on groundwater to large extent,” it had said. These three projects — Renukaji, Kishau and Lakhwar & Vyasi Dams — have been declared as national projects.

The Jal Board in consultation with Delhi government has initiated the process for revival and rejuvenation of 155 waterbodies, which are owned by the various departments and government agencies in Delhi. Besides this, a list of 559 government buildings has been shared with the heads of the departments with a request to implement rainwater harvesting systems in these buildings, it said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rainwater-harvesters-now-in-3496-institutions-djb/article30447303.ece

The students’ union said that the appeal was “nothing short of a conceit and a desperate effort to mislead the student community”.

The V-C had said the winter semester of 2020 will start as per academic schedule, and that the university was giving an opportunity to those who could not complete their academic requirements in the monsoon semester to take “provisional registration” during the registration period from January 1–5. He asked them to complete their academic requirements by January 20.

High Court order

The JNUSU said the Delhi High Court in its order passed on December 23 observed that the solution to the current crisis must be found by the Vice-Chancellor only through dialogue with stakeholders, which are the students.

However, the V-C is creating an environment that is far from conducive and where negotiations can further proceed, the students alleged.

“Even as the talks were on, circulars were released by the administration which clearly shows that it still believes in the modus operandi of ‘pretending to hold dialogue’ rather than actually ‘holding one’. The circulars and a message from the V-C are clear indications that the administration still enforces decisions on whims and fancies,” the students said.

The students added that even after being repeatedly reprimanded by the courts to have proper deliberation and work in the spirit of resolution, the V-C has come out and said he is unable to understand why the students have been agitating.

“It is your [the Vice-Chancellor] responsibility to see that the university functions normally. The courts have advised you to do the same. However, there can be no artificial normalcy based on imposition of fee hikes and illegal hostel manual,” the JNUSU said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnusu-calls-for-boycott-of-new-semester-registration-process/article30447288.ece
248,2020/01/01,‘Regret inconvenience caused to AMU students due to police action’,"Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor on Tuesday, in a letter to the students, said he regretted inconvenienced caused to them as a consequence of police action on the campus on December 15.

Appeal to students

He also appealed to students for their cooperation in the smooth running of the campus and said he would engage in a dialogue with them.

“I respect the spirit of AMU students for carrying out protests peacefully to bring the nation’s attention to laws which they feel are objectionable,” wrote Mr. Mansoor, stressing that students had the right to share their views on any subject in a democratic manner.

He added that his administration had no intention of subverting the rights of the students.

To injured students

“A robust democracy relies on the active participation of its citizens, especially the young who are the future of the country” the letter reads.

Referring to the December 15 incident, including “injuries caused by police action and the mental trauma”, Mr. Masnoor told the injured students and their families that he regretted what had happened. He said he also regretted the inconvenience caused to students as a consequence of a decision to vacate the hostels.

“Certain outcomes of our decisions at times are affected by many unforeseen circumstances and criticism at times is fair,” Mr. Mansoor wrote. He, however, stated that the decision to allow the police on campus was taken “in good faith and with a clear conscience” in order to respond to a situation that was going out of hand.

The university would do everything possible “within its powers and legal boundaries” to ensure justice is delivered to the innocent, he added.

He also appealed to students to help “identify troublemakers” who try to create rifts between the students and the administration.

He said he expected the students to ensure that their genuine concerns were not hijacked by vested interest.

“Creating an atmosphere of anarchy will hurt our credibility as peaceful citizens and validate the lies being spread about our beloved university,” Mr. Mansor wrote.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/regret-inconvenience-caused-to-amu-students-due-to-police-action/article30447276.ece
249,2020/01/01,"Delhiites welcome New Year at pubs, malls and anti-CAA protest sites","On the New Year’s eve, protest sites turned into celebration venues for scores of Delhiites who braved a chilly winter night to oppose the CAA, while several others thronged restaurants, pubs, malls and other public spaces to bid goodbye to 2019 as police remained on the toes.

Anticipating huge crowd on the New Year’s Eve, the Delhi Metro had restricted exit from the busy Rajiv Chowk station. The Delhi Traffic Police had imposed specific restrictions from 8 pm onwards in the vicinity of Connaught Place (CP) and nearby areas. No vehicular traffic was allowed in CP’s inner, middle and outer circle.

“I have come at India Gate along with my family to celebrate new year. This time, we are not seeing much crowd here and police have blocked the India Gate premises and are not letting anyone go inside,” said Mukesh Sangwan, 48, a businessman.

A newly married couple also turned to India Gate for the celebration of new year.

“I have come here with my wife. This is our first new year together as we recently got married. The area of India Gate is closed and we are thinking to go to Connaught Place for dinner,” said Rahul Bishnoi, 29, who works at an MNC in Gurgaon.

Security was beefed up across the national capital, especially in the vicinity of markets, malls, five-star hotels, restaurants, pubs and bars, in order to ensure orderly celebrations. All PCR vans, Raftaar motorcycles and Prakhar vans were dynamically deployed at vulnerable points, according to police officials.

Adeel Khan, a 29-year-old student, who was at the CP for the celebrations said, “It is less crowded here this time. I have been coming here from the last two-three years. Roads are closed and people have to walk to reach here”.

With fog over Connaught Place, some people were roaming its inner circle with vuvuzela in their hands and making sounds.

Sridhar Shukla, a samosa seller, said he served the delicacy to many people and expressed satisfaction over the day’s business.

There were gatherings at major markets and popular party hotspots, including Select City Walk mall in Saket, Nehru Place, Khan Market, Rajouri Garden and Connaught Place.

“We faced inconvenience in reaching Connaught Place. We had to park our car near Barakhambha and walked all the way to CP. I am with my college friends. We will enjoy here and have plans to go to Murthal for a long drive and late night dinner,” said Vaibhav Sharma, 24, a Delhi University student.

Thousands of people gathered at Shaheen Bagh, the venue of a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act, on Tuesday night to welcome 2020 with the hope that the new year will see the law being repealed.

Meher, 16, and her brother Aman, 12, held placards in their hands, both handwritten poetries.

“I am not into the Hindu-Muslim divide, my only concern is that the law discriminates on grounds of religion and that should never happen in India,” the Class 11 student told PTI.

Their father, Mohammed Furqan, said the children on their own chose to come to the protest on the cold night.

“We have been coming to this venue regularly now and also going to other protest venues nearby, like the Jamia University. The children now have access to TV and internet and themselves realise what they need to do,” the 46-year-old businessman said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/udye6c/article30446896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWYEAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhiites-welcome-new-year-at-pubs-malls-and-anti-caa-protest-sites/article30446897.ece
250,2020/01/01,Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh rings in new year with anti-Citizenship Act slogans,"Protesters who have been camping in south-east Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh around-the-clock to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act for two weeks now, rang in the New Year with slogans of ‘Azadi’.

Scores of people from across the city flocked to the Noida-Kalindi Kunj Highway in a show of solidarity. “Since I did not get a chance to be part of any of the protests related to this matter, today I have come here,” said Nitesh Singh, a resident of Malviya Nagar. He had come to the site with his friends.

People from all walks of like, including artists, professors, students, stood on the highway that has been blocked with police barricades on both ends.

“We are out on the streets to fight for our rights,” said Firdos (32), one of the several housewives who has been leading the protests here in the severe cold.

For the event, posters with messages inviting people from across the city were shared on social media platforms like WhatsApp.

A beautiful rendition

Apart from activists speaking at the event, bands comprising students and others performed songs of revolution and celebrations.

A similar protest celebration, welcoming the new year took place at Jamia Milia Islamia, which too has become a hub for anti-CAA protests in the city.

Pressure from officials

For the past few weeks, the protesters here have been facing pressure from officials to vacate the area in many instances.

Earlier this week, the area SHO had issued a notice, asking the protesters to vacate the area owing to problems in “supply of essential goods and services”.

Also, Resident Welfare Association of the area and a local BJP leader have written letters to the police asking them to call off the protests at Shaheen Bagh.

Meraj Khan, an organiser of the event, said individuals had attempted to flare up tensions among the crowd by making communal speeches and instigating arguments but were “chased away”.

“The policemen have told us that they won’t remove us if the protest is peaceful,” said Khan. However, many protesters at the site were concerned that some individuals may try to disrupt the agitation and invite police action. Many artists in the protest conducted ‘art therapy’ programmes and games for children present at the site.

The children were asked what they would do if they were the Prime Minister of the country.

251,2020/01/01,Bhooma came as Andal,"The Lord is anxious to save jivatmas and grant them moksha, but this anxiety is even greater in His Consort, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse. When Rama is exiled to the forest, Sita insists on accompanying Him. She says She will walk in front on Him, and will trample down any thorns in the path, thus making the way smooth for Him. While this is certainly a mark of Sita’s devotion to Lord Rama, it also has a symbolic meaning. She is indicating that She will soften the hearts of people, so that they become ready to receive Him.

With this characteristic anxiety for jivatmas, Bhooma Devi asks Lord Varaha to suggest some easy ways of reaching His feet. He has already given the world many ways of reaching Him. But these are too difficult for most people. So Bhooma Devi wants something easier. In reply to her question, Lord Varaha says that there are two easy ways of reaching Him — one is singing about Him; the other is to surrender to Him. But Goddess Earth is not content to merely know the answer to Her question. She aims to inform the world about what the Lord told Her in private. She wants to make the secret of liberation public, so as to benefit all mankind. So, She takes the avatara of Andal. Anantazhvan, a disciple of Ramanujacharya, wrote a work titled Goda Catusloki, which records the greatness of Andal. Anantazhvan says that the Lord’s Consort came as Andal, with the quickness of an arrow shot from a bow. Bhoo Devi’s Gayatri mantra says She is dhanurdharAyai, that is the One who has a bow in Her hand. Anantazhvan must have had this in mind, when he described Andal’s speedy descent to the earth. Andal’s Thiruppavai contains the essence of the Vedas, and recitation of Her verses takes us nearer God.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/bhooma-came-as-andal/article30453448.ece
252,2020/01/01,Woman who attempted immolation succumbs,"The 37-year-old woman who allegedly set herself on fire at Panjagutta Police Station died on Tuesday midnight. The woman S. Lokeshwari suffered over 80% burns. Police said that she disclosed to them that mental and physical harassment by a person S Praveen Kumar led her to take the extreme step.

In 2000, the woman got married to Srinivas of Chennai. Srinivas deserted her after they had a daughter, and died in 2015. Meanwhile, in 2012, she got acquainted with Praveen Kumar in Tirupati, which led to love. They moved to Hyderabad in 2013 and stayed at a rented home in BS Maqta. He promised to marry Lokeshwari even though he knew she has a daughter.

Lokeshwari used to work as a manager in Praveen Kumar’s jewellery store in Somajiguda and looked after it when he went to other countries for work, said Panjagutta Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Thirupathanna.

In June of 2014, Praveen lodged a complaint against Lokeshwari and others regarding gold ornaments and cash which were missing from his store. She, along with her associates, were arrested by police who recovered the missing ornaments and cash. The case was charged and they settled the matter in December 2014.

There on, Praveen started to avoid Lokeshwari. She stayed in Hyderabad for some time and went to Chennai in 2017.

The ACP said that Lokeshwari visited Hyderabad along with her house owner P Arasakannan on December 27, 2019. On the same evening, she lodged a complaint against Praveen alleging that he cheated her and requested to recover ₹ 7.5 lakh from him.

Based on her complaint , Panjagutta police sub-inspector B Vijay Bhaskar Reddy asked Praveen to come to the police station for inquiry. Denying allegations levelled by Lokeshwari, Praveen sought time as he was on business tour to Bengaluru.

“She purchased two litres of petrol on December 31 from a petrol pump by showing her Aadhaar card, concealed it in her bag and started to search for Praveen in Panjagutta. But she did not find him,” the ACP said, adding that she attempted to end her life as she was mentally disturbed because of the alleged harassment and cheating by Praveen.

She doused herself in petrol, set herself on fire at Punjagutta bus stop and ran into the Police Station premises. Constables put off the fire and rushed her to Osmania General Hospital. The Police said that a constable M Mounika recorded Lokeshwari’s statement at the hospital on Tuesday night. Police registered cases under Sections 306 (abetment of suicide), 420 (cheating) and 417 (Punishment for cheating) and took up investigation.

After post-mortem examination, her body was preserved at the hospital’s mortuary as her relatives could not afford to take her body to their native place for final rites.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/woman-who-attempted-immolation-succumbs/article30454156.ece
253,2020/01/01,Fund crunch hits Wyra municipality,"The Wyra municipality continues to grapple with fund crunch even as its maiden civic polls are just round the corner.

The civic body came into existence in 2018, following the upgradation of the then Wyra Gram Panchayat into a municipality comprising a total of 20 wards.

Ever since its inception, the Wyra municipality is struggling to clear the outstanding power bill arrears, which mounted to a whopping around ₹2.50 crore, sources said.

When Wyra was a Gram Panchayat, it owed ₹2.14 crore electricity bill arrears to the Northern Power Distribution Company of Telangana Limited (TSNPDCL). The power bill dues largely remained unpaid even after its upgradation into municipality. As the total outstanding power bill dues further escalated, the TSNPDCL reportedly snapped power supply to the municipal office building in Wyra town on Tuesday night.

The action followed a series of reminders sent by the TSNPDCL officials concerned to the civic body staff to clear the pending electricity arrears without further delay.

Stung by the disconnection of power supply to the municipal office, the civic officials concerned reportedly approached the TSNPDCL authorities and sought some time to clear all the outstanding electricity bill dues, sources said.

Following the intervention of higher-ups, the power supply was restored to the office building on Wednesday morning, much to the relief of the municipal staff on New Year’s day.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/1y48m7/article30454077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02WYRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fund-crunch-hits-wyra-municipality/article30454078.ece

255,2020/01/01,EFLU students protest against extension of vacation,"Students of the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) sat on a protest on Wednesday after the university announced the extension of winter vacation to January 17, citing ongoing repair works in the hostels.

As the students protested that they had already come back from the vacation and it was difficult for them to book the tickets again, EFLU Vice-Chancellor E. Suresh Kumar invited the student representatives to talks. He promised them that the university would bear the charges for the return tickets and also work with the South Central Railway to expedite their reservation confirmation.

Prof. Suresh Kumar said students were convinced after the discussions and left the protest place with the assurance that they would come back after speaking to other students. “So far, they have not come back. They looked convinced with my reasoning,” he said.

The Vice Chancellor said that vacation was extended as the work of revamping the wash rooms was on in the hostels. “We have to utilise a few crores given by the UGC within three months or else they will lapse. It is difficult to carry on repairs in wash rooms when students are around,” he said.

The PhD students present on the campus were asked to vacate the hostels before January 3.

However, a section of students argued that the move was to curtail the protests that students might take up against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) once they return from the vacation. The varsity administration was under pressure from political bosses on the issue, a student said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/eflu-students-protest-against-extension-of-vacation/article30453392.ece
256,2020/01/01,Poetry enthusiasts have a run-in with police,"New Year revelers who were on their way to listen to and recite verses composed by their favourite poets at a private party were in for a shock as several were stopped by police, questioned, and sent back.

The poetry reading session on theme ‘Night of Resistance – Poetry, Dark Humour, Vocals and Chai Pani’, was organised at a house in Murad Nagar. Invitations were shared on social media.

However, witnesses claimed that police prevented them from reaching the venue. “Police parked their vehicles a few houses away and began questioning us. This was intimidating,” said an invitee.

Syeda Fatima, a school principal, and her husband, too were sent back. “When I asked them what was wrong, they said that the intention of the party was unclear. I was shocked to hear that and I tried reasoning with them by saying people were drunk on the streets. But they didn’t listen,” Fatima said.

Mujataba Khan (name changed) said that he was searching for the venue but police allegedly stopped him, and confiscated his phone.

“I am from Jharkhand and work in an IT firm in Hitec City. I got the invitation on a WhatsApp group. After police stopped me, I explained all this to them. My phone was taken away, and I got it back only today. I was very worried,” he said.

While the organisers maintained that the event was a private do, a police officer from the Asif Nagar police station denied all claims and said that police presence was on account of New Year revelry.

“It was a party at a home where poetry was read and tea was served. Why would we need police permission for this,” Laeeq Ahmad Khan, a professional, and one of the organisers, said.

When contacted, West Zone Deputy Commissioner of Police A R Srinivas, alluding to the anti-CAA protests, said, “I have looked into the matter. They didn’t take permission.

257,2020/01/01,TSRTC went through a tumultuous time last year,"The year gone by was a tumultuous year for Telangana State Road Transport Corporation, marked with protests and unrest. The transport juggernaut witnessed the longest strike in its history towards the end of 2019.

The 54-day strike of over 48,000 TSRTC workers began on October 5, and saw five suicides, and, around 30 deaths, attributed to the affects of the strike.

At the top of the list of demands was merger of the corporation with the State government. What ensued was a stand-off between Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and the TSRTC management led by in-charge Managing Director Sunil Sharma on one side, and the TSTRC Joint Action Committee on the other.

The Chief Minister threatened to shut down the Corporation which carries several lakhs of passengers every day, and questioned the timing of the strike – ahead of Dasara. Meanwhile, unions maintained that money was owed to workers and their demands were legitimate. Committees of IAS officers and later, Executive Directors, were set up to break the stalemate, but failed.

As per information obtained under the Right to Information Act, post the formation of Telangana, the Corporation’s losses skyrocketed from ₹ 5.47 crore in 2012-13 to ₹ 748.90 crore in 2017-18, an increase in losses of 150%. The following fiscal, the losses mounted to around ₹ 900 crore.

“The Chief Minister tried to project that the RTC deserves to be closed down, or privatised, due to losses. He also said that workers were self-dismissed, a term which doesn’t exist in labour laws. Now, after the strike, there are two predominant feelings: one is that the strike has achieved little, and the other is that measures are being taken by the government, but one step at a time. However, one thing is certain: workers were relieved to be back after fighting for their legitimate demands,” a union leader said.

Soon after the strike, and in an attempt to streamline processes, and to cut losses, the TSRTC gave the go-ahead for cargo services, as directed by the Chief Minister. And in a major relief to senior workers, the State government also cleared the decks for enhancement of retirement age of employees by two years – from 58 years to 60.

In another significant move, the TSRTC increased ticket fares by 20 paise per km. The move also included hiking the prices of bus passes, which TSRTC official say, contributes to issues in calculating the ridership. The last time fares were hiked was in 2016.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tp2r6g/article30452910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02RTC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tsrtc-went-through-a-tumultuous-time-last-year/article30452911.ece
258,2020/01/01,Hyderabad : Requiem for a decade,"What is so special about the passage of 2019 that an audit has been invited for it? It happens every year and, as we get older, we make the transition without fussing about it.

Come to think about it, we have grown distrustful about the fall of a tyrant which let us down and hope the new year turns out better. It is the hopes of our youngsters which supersedes our pessimistic outlook. In the balance, optimism of the young will always have an edge over the cynicism of the aged. That is the only way for life to prevail over death.

But wait. It is not just the passage of a year. It is also the demise of a decade and the birth of a new one. It is only fair to give the event a little more consideration than to give a quiet burial to an annual event. But wait again. Earlier, we had public landmarks against which to pass a judgement about the achievements and failure of decades. Take for example, the master plans of urban development. They provided a perspective for the direction and pace of progress. When did we have the last master plan? Not in this century. The same about developing social infrastructure, preserving heritage and the like. So, how do we decide whether we are making progress, stagnating, or just drifting? Our march is marked by neutral episodes.

In the outgoing decade, a major political episode was the birth of Telangana. Was it an achievement or a mere course -correction by reversing the birth of Andhra Pradesh half century earlier? Earlier, we provided signposts for evaluation; now there are none. Earlier, there were friendly matches to say hurrah for the winner. Now there is din raised in favour or against about non-events. We have plain barren landscape without a moral compass. An outcry against police apathy in a case of rape and murder is easily turned into public salutation by short-circuiting the legal procedure through an encounter.

How do we judge? I am confused. So are a large number of citizens. We keep our judgement to ourselves. In silence lies safety. Give me the rules of the game, score board and guidelines. Till then I withhold my verdict. But does it matter?

Lenin remarked once that decades pass with nothing happening. And then comes a week when decades happen. The outgoing decades was one such barren decade. We hope the coming decade is different.

262,2020/01/01,Realty to soar ‘high’ in 2020,"The city is set to see the launch of several high-rise towers, both residential and commercial, in the coming year.

Delay in issuing environmental permissions has resulted in en masse clearance of a number of large projects towards the end of the year. All these projects are now, being lined up for launch in 2020. More projects could be in the pipeline after clearance by the State-Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority and State Expert Appraisal Committee, which were re-constituted five months ago after much delay.

As per official estimates, projects held up for want of environmental clearance could be around 180.

All proposals exceeding 20,000 square metres of constructed space need to obtain environmental permissions, and it includes several proposals for gated communities, apartment complexes, multiplexes, hospitals, hotels and commercial premises.

After environmental clearance, all these come to GHMC for building permissions, and have one year’s time to launch the project after permission is granted.

GHMC’s Town Planning wing has cleared 723 big projects in the current year, of which 570 are residential and 153 are commercial buildings. At least 17 among these are high-rise projects, majority of them located in the western part of the city, Khajaguda, Nanakramguda, Raidurg, Gachibowli, Gopanpally, Kothaguda, Shaikpet, Nallagandla, Kondapur and Serilingampally.

Height of the towers ranged from 24 to 36 floors for commercial buildings and between eight and 30 floors for residential projects.

The Town Planning wing has issued permissions to a total of 16,801 structures this calendar year, of which 16,565 are residential and 236 are commercial. Close to ₹1,000 crore was collected by way of fee for building permissions.

Of the total, 1,902 were residential apartment complexes, with combined built up space of 6.83 crore square feet, and 37,328 dwelling units.

263,2020/01/01,"Cong. leaders meet Governor, seek action against city police chief","Led by Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, a delegation of Congress leaders called on Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan at Raj Bhavan, on Tuesday, seeking action against Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar and order an inquiry into his alleged “corrupt practices”.

The delegation alleged “rude replies” by the Police Commissioner during a telephonic conversation by the party leaders who sought to know why permission was denied for their ‘Save India Save Constitution’ rally on December 28, the formation day of the Congress.

The Congress also alleged that when they decided to sit on a Satyagraha inside the party office after permission was denied, police arrested cadre and leaders coming to Gandhi Bhavan.

“Is Congress a banned organisation that its members were arrested for coming to participate in activities relating to the party’s 135th Foundation Day and against CAA,”? Mr. Reddy asked while speaking to the media after meeting the Governor.

Mr. Reddy said that the Governor was apprised of the entire issue and how the Hyderabad Police have been acting in an “arbitrary and high-handed manner”.

The Governor was requested to take action as she has special powers in terms of all law and order issues as per Section 8 of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014 in the city for ten years starting 2014.

The delegation comprised K. Jana Reddy, Ponnala Lakshmaiah, A. Revanth Reddy, Mohammed Ali Shabbir, V. Hanumantha Rao, D. Sridhar Babu, Seethakka and Kusum Kumar.

‘Anjani of AP cadre’

The TPCC chief said that Mr. Anjani Kumar was allotted to AP cadre after bifurcation. However, he is continuing in Telangana with a stay order from the court. He asked Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao whether there was no IPS officer from Telangana cadre who was fit to hold the post of Hyderabad Police Commissioner.

“This clearly shows how he is favouring the ruling party and towing the line of TRS leaders just because he got a powerful post despite belonging to Andhra cadre,” he alleged.

The Congress leaders also demanded an inquiry into the conduct of Mr. Anjani Kumar. “There are allegations of corruption and only a public inquiry can bring out the truth”.

When asked whether the Congress has evidence to substantiate the allegation, he said that all the complaints received against the Police Commissioner would be forwarded to the authorities if an inquiry was ordered. Mr. Reddy also alleged that “KCR has been using the police to suppress any dissent or any democratic form of protest”. Members of parties and civil society organisations were placed under house arrest whenever they give a protest call.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/y3lila/article30446795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-CONG-BETTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cong-leaders-meet-governor-seek-action-against-city-police-chief/article30446790.ece
264,2020/01/01,RGIA is sixth busiest airport in country,"Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) here handled 21 million passengers this year and has become the six busiest airport in the country in terms of air traffic movement. It is already handling up to 60,000 passengers a day with air traffic of 550 planes, in terms of both domestic and international arrivals and departures.

“We have been seeing a robust growth in passenger traffic of close to 20% consistently in the past four years,” said senior officials of the airport, pleading anonymity.

If the first phase has been designed to handle 12 million passengers a year, the second phase of expansion currently under construction is being built to handle 34 million passengers. It has 25 airlines operating, including 21 on the international routes and eight on the domestic routes.

Innovative features

The country’s first modern greenfield airport developed under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) model, has also been the launch pad for several innovative features over the years. This year itself, face recognition trials was taken up under the Union Government’s ‘DigiYatra’ in July with more than 4,000 passengers registering for the facility and up to 6,000 passengers using it to access the airport. A body scanner trial too was taken up in October with one such facility at the third departure gates.

Other special features introduced recently are the first ever ‘FASTag Car Park’ in collaboration with the National Payments Corporation of India with dedicated lanes created at the entry and exit points to ensure zero wait time. It began with ICICI and soon other major banks are to be brought under the system. Non-FASTag vehicles too would continue to use the existing parking system, they explained.

The cloud-based central irrigation control system for efficient use of water in the irrigation system across the 80 acres of landscape spread along the 8.4 km stretch of the airport spine road is helping save 35% of water over the conventional mode of irrigation system.

Cargo terminal

The 1.50 lakh metric tonnes (MT) integrated cargo terminal had lifted 1.35 lakh MTs this financial year and ‘Hyderabad Cargo Charter Circle (HC3)’ was started as a dedicated platform for facilitating cargo charter operators for round-the-clock response, logistics support, etc. SpiceJet, in fact, is the first to have started an exclusive freight service from here.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ir9uds/article30446720.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy01Highcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rgia-is-sixth-busiest-airport-in-country/article30446704.ece

266,2020/01/01,HC gives green signal to Numaish,"The uncertainty over Numaish, the annual all-India Industrial Exhibition that begins on January 1 every year, ended on Tuesday with the Telangana High Court giving green signal to the event.

Taking into consideration the explanation given by authorities over safety precautions put in place for the event, a bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy passed direction permitting the exhibition. Lawyer Khaja Aijazuddin, who filed a PIL plea stating that a fire accident during the previous year’s industrial exhibition raised questions over safety of people, brought to the notice of the bench that there was difference in the number of stalls mentioned in the exhibition society website and the records presented to the court.

“While the exhibition society’s official website showed the Numaish would be having 2,900 stalls, on records they said 1,500 stalls would be there,” Mr. Aijazuddin said. Taking note of the lawyer’s contention, the bench directed the State Legal Services Authority to visit the exhibition to ascertain how many stalls were there and present a report on the safety mechanisms set up there by January 6.

The bench said three of the nine exit gates of the exhibition should be kept open. The remaining should not be locked but trained staff should be deployed there for supervision. In the PIL petition, the lawyer contended that the authorities failed to take adequate safety measures due to which the fire took place. Without initiating any corrective measures, the society went ahead to organise Numaish this year as well, he said in the petition.

On hearing the plea, the bench instructed Hyderabad Police Commissioner to furnish a detailed report on the issues raised by the petitioner. After perusing it, the bench pointed out lacunae in the report observing that it did not contain precise precautionary measures initiated by different government wings concerned like the Fire Services.

Special Government Pleader Sharath Kumar submitted to the court that the Exhibition Society had paid the dues owed to different government departments online and had taken extensive security and safety measures for the event. The bench, after perusing the second report of the Police Commissioner, passed the order permitting commencement of the exhibition.

The plea was posted to January 6 for next hearing. Mr. Aijazuddin, speaking to mediapersons later, said that he would move the Supreme Court challenging the HC direction on the matter.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9r9huj/article30446628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31-NUMAISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hc-gives-green-signal-to-numaish/article30446603.ece
267,2020/01/01,‘Depth and spirituality of Sufi poetry appeals to me’,"Growing up in Bengaluru, Smita Rao Bellur was introduced to Hindustani classical music by her parents. Kishori Amonkar and Arati Ankalikar-Tikekar were her favourites. She started training at the age of 12, and learnt the nuances of the Kirana and Jaipur gharanas.

Turning point

Later, during a shuttle bus ride while working at an IT company, she was suddenly captivated by a version of the traditional Sufi song ‘Allah Hoo’ by Aziz Ahmed Warsi. “That incident changed my life, and I decided to get deeply into the Sufi genre,” she recalls.

Now settled in Mumbai, Bellur will perform the ‘Kun Faya Koon - Sufi Verses Of Love concert’, on Friday. Organised by Competence Marketing and Events, it will be scripted and narrated by Urdu poet and writer Suhail Akhtar Warsi.

“The two of us have been thinking of various thematic concepts for quite some time. The concert will feature authentic Sufi kalaam, and I will sing the works of Hyderabadi poets like Shaz Tamkanat. His ‘Kab Tak Mere Maula’ is like an anthem for me,” says Bellur.

Besides popular works like Amir Khusro’s ‘Chaap Tilak’, Bellur will sing rarer compositions like, ‘Kanhaiya, Yaad Hai’ written by former Hyderabadi nawab Sadiq Jung Bahadur ‘Hilm’. Allama Iqbal’s ‘Sitaron Se Aage’, is also on the list. “The depth and spirituality of Sufi poetry appealed to me. I wanted these messages to reach out to audiences. I pay a lot of attention to the meaning and background, whether I am singing Sufi kalaam or Kannada vachanas,” says the singer.

Vast repertoire

Bellur has had some remarkable teachers – for Hindustani classical skills, she was guided by P.R. Bhagwat, Arjunsa Nakod, Rajabhau Sontakke and Alka Dev Maruldhar. Dr. Ejazuddin and Syed Zia Alvi helped her with Sufi thought, and for qawwali, she learnt from the famed Warsi Brothers of Hyderabad. “In Mumbai, my regular discussions with Suhail Akhtar Warsi have helped a lot,” she shares.

Bellur is happy with her decision of quitting a full-time job to pursue music. She recalls, “I would work 10 or 12 hours a day, and though I enjoyed it, would look for the next opportunity to practise music. I would [perform] classical concerts in smaller towns, because they have good listeners. I also love listening to old film songs and Rajasthani folk music.” A few months ago, she released the single ‘Na Aaye Who’, written by Zeeshan Niazi, on YouTube. “I’m now looking forward to doing more thematic concerts focusing on rich poetry,” she concludes.

268,2020/01/01,100 street vendors to be rehabilitated in N. Paravur,"The North Paravur Municipality is set to relocate over 100 roadside vendors spread over the busy town area with the first of the three-phase project to be inaugurated shortly.

The project, entailing an investment of ₹36.50 lakh, is being executed by the municipality under the National Urban Livelihoods Mission. The project was proposed by the municipality earlier this year to de-congest the roads in the city and to ensure smooth traffic.

In the first phase of the project named Muziris Bazaar, 24 roadside vendors on the busy stretch between the Municipal Junction and Chennamangalam Junction will be rehabilitated near the private bus stand. Among other things, the project is aimed at improving the living standards of vendors.

The project was all set to be inaugurated last month before it had to be postponed owing to some unexpected inconvenience of the Minister for Local Self-Government Department. The municipal authorities are now trying for a date of the Minister to launch the project at the earliest.

“We have identified over 100 roadside vendors to be rehabilitated under the project through a survey and they have been issued identity cards as well. We have identified two more locations in the town for the second and third phase of the project,” said municipal chairman D. Rajkumar.

The relocation of the vendors was delayed till the end of the Christmas season since any attempt to relocate them would have thrown a spanner in their festival season business.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/100-street-vendors-to-be-rehabilitated-in-n-paravur/article30447443.ece

270,2020/01/01,January 8 strike will see good response: Karim,"CITU State secretary Elamaram Karim has said here that the all-India general strike called by trade unions across the political spectrum on January 8 will receive an “unprecedented” response from the labouring class given the current political and economic conditions in the country.

Speaking to reporters here on Tuesday, he said workers from various sectors would participate in the strike. The general strike will also have its impact on rural life, he added.

The major demands raised by the unions include a minimum wage of ₹21,00 per month and social security cover for workers, Mr. Karim said, adding that ever since the BJP assumed office in 2014, it had been following anti-worker policies. “Labour policies are now being oriented to help employers at the peril of workers. The new laws will also break the collective bargaining power of the working class,” he observed.

The workers are also demanding that the government turn back from its policy of privatisation of public sector undertakings. Mr. Karim listed a number of PSUs that had been lined up for privatisation including BPCL, HNL, and HLL.

271,2020/01/01,Metro ridership goes up by 32%,"The Kochi metro ridership increased by 41 lakh in 2019, a rise of 32% over 2018.

Altogether, 1,65,99,020 passengers travelled in the metro in 2019 as compared to 1,24,95,884 in 2018, Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) informed. The leap in the number of commuters is attributed mainly to the commissioning of the Thykoodam extension in September 2019.

The ridership in 2019 was 88,83,184 till September 3. From September 4 (launch of Thykoodam stretch) to December 30, it was 77,14,836.

273,2020/01/01,Experts for Metrolite as alternative to fresh metro extensions in Kochi,"The restraint exercised by the Centre while approving the costly conventional metro rail projects in various States has prompted experts in mass rapid transport (MRT) to advocate the ‘Metrolite’ (light urban rail) system for the Kochi metro’s Kakkanad and other extensions. Incidentally, it leaves a minuscule carbon footprint and cost approximately a quarter of the project cost of the metro rail system.

“We are happy that the Centre has readied a policy to promote Metrolite systems like trams, which can operate on the existing arterial roads.

“Within trams, there are conventional trams that operate on rails and newer systems which do not need tracks. The trackless systems in which the trams have rubber wheels like buses are operational in several world cities including in China. Trams rely on sensors to move along a pre-determined track. Such technological advancements have considerably lessened the cost of Metrolite systems,” said a technical expert who was associated with numerous metro rail initiatives in India.

“The clamour for systems like trams comes in the wake of the realisation that the conventional metro rail system costs over ₹250 crore per km. Trams that operate at comparable speeds as those of the metro offer similar comfort and have much lesser ticket fares.

“The advantage of track-less trams which carry over double the number of passengers in a bus is that they can negotiate sharp curves just like buses, doing away with the need to acquire land,” he added.

This apart, a basic shelter for commuters to wait is all that is required at the centre of the road, facing tramways on either side, unlike heavy concrete structures that are needed for elevated or underground metro stations.

A few lakh tonnes of concrete are needed for metro rail systems for piles, pile caps, pillars, and girders. Tram shelters can be built every 600 metres or so due to their simple construction style, benefiting more number of commuters than the metro.

“The doing away with elevated/undergound track, minimal land acquisition [in case it is needed] etc., offer the added advantage of carrying out little or no physical change on the urban landscape. It also does away with extensive security checks and deployment of a massive workforce to man station buildings. Neither do they have ‘barriers’ to surmount like steps and escalators in metro rail stations,” said a public-transport expert.

Trams can rely on flash-charging method to recharge their batteries during halt at stations. Such Metrolite tramways are good for low-density cities like Kochi, where capital-intensive metro rail systems need not get sound ridership. Such systems are comparable to high-capacity bus systems, with similar flexibility as far as extensions and diversions are concerned. All this bring about faster project implementation in a sustainable manner at much lesser cost, while catering for more commuters than the metro, he observed.

Trams were the preferred mode of transport from 1890s to 1940s till they were withdrawn in favour of buses and cars, which ended up polluting the atmosphere and causing frequent accidents.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/4j24i5/article30447407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01KITRAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/experts-for-metrolite-as-alternative-to-fresh-metro-extensions-in-kochi/article30447408.ece

Parking and traffic between BTH Junction and High Court Junction will be completely banned. In fact, the police have suggested that the public use the Kochi metro at that time.

Vehicles carrying delegates from Aroor, Thripunithura, West Kochi, Kakkanad, Muvattupuzha and Perumbavoor regions should drop them in front of the State Bank of India on the northern side of the Palarivattom bypass and should proceed to Container Terminal Road via Edappally for parking.

Vehicles from the Aluva region should enter National Highway 17 for dropping delegates before proceeding to Container Terminal Road. Delegates from Paravur, Kodungalloor and Varapuzha areas should get down before Lulu Mall, and the vehicles should head towards Container Road via Kalamasserry for parking.

The lorry was parked by the side of the road when the accident took place on the Chelamattam stretch of M.C. Road around 3 a.m. The deceased was identified as Dharmalingam, 44, of Gandhi Nagar, Tirupur, Tamil Nadu.

The contract carriage, registered in Tamil Nadu, was headed from Tirupur to Sabarimala when tragedy struck. “The driver of the bus probably dozed off following which the vehicle rammed the lorry.

276,2020/01/01,Project Suraksha to insulate school campuses from drugs,"Contraband networks are increasingly targeting educational institutions in the district, luring students initially as users before turning them into carriers.

Realising that enforcement agencies cannot battle the menace alone, the district panchayat in association with the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) has rolled out a project, Suraksha, in 10 high schools under its jurisdiction on an experimental basis to keep drugs away from campuses by reviving School Protection Groups (SPGs) which are now largely defunct.

“The idea is to stir up a mass people’s movement without which there can be no effective mechanism to prevent the penetration of drugs into schools. Initially, SPGs will be revived after which frequent inspections will be conducted with people’s participation in shops in the vicinity of schools to ensure that they do not deal in drugs,” District Child Protection Officer K.B. Zaina told The Hindu.

Efforts are on to create a network of mentors or informers to alert about potential drug peddling around schools. At present, the Excise and even school counsellors are not included in SPGs, a shortcoming which the DCPU is trying to address.

“Schools are often reluctant to accept the reality of drug menace, prompting us to launch the project. We have already imparted training to school counsellors and convened a meeting of counsellors and head masters. Shortly, school-level awareness sessions will be organised. We are planning to expand it to more schools in due course,” said District Panchayat President Dolly Kuriakose.

A.S. Ranjith, Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam, said that both school authorities and parents were largely on denial mode when substance abuse by students emerges, while fear of being targeted by youngsters high on drugs also play in the minds of teachers.

“While schools do not want their image to take a hit, parents are obsessively protective of their wards and even put the blame on friends when presented with evidence against their children. Such attempts to sweep the problem under the carpet and protect reputation rather than facing it up front will only explode on their faces a couple of years down the line when the names of those youngsters figure in the media when they get caught for drug abuse,” he added.

Schools often take the easy way out by ousting students found to be using drugs rather than reforming them. There have been at least two such instances where students had to be reinstated after the DCPU intervened.

“There could be more such unknown cases of arbitrary methods of schools owing to the ignorance of parents,” said DCPU sources.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/e01are/article30447392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvkisuraksha,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/project-suraksha-to-insulate-school-campuses-from-drugs/article30447393.ece

278,2020/01/01,How Hyderabadi comedian Saikiran is laughing to the comedy bank,"Saikiran’s routines across his own Pure Veg Jokes, Hyderabadass Comedy Club and other standup evenings always see a packed room. The comedian went viral in 2019 with videos of his routines sprawling all over WhatsApp and social media platforms.

It was not always like this; he had humble beginnings, first taking to the stage at an open mic contest, which he won, in January of 2014. “Over the years I have been opening acts for many of the biggest stars of Indian comedy when they visited Hyderabad and have even travelled to Bengaluru and Mumbai to be part of lineup shows,” he says proudly. He then proceeded to launch his first solo show Pure Veg Jokes (PVJ) on March 18, 2018. “The last few of the PVJ sets will be taking place over the next couple of months.”

Break the Internet

Saikiran’s most popular routine was released in the form of a YouTube video, ‘Dark Skin & Getting Married’ on February 11, 2019 — and that is when things really kicked off for him. The routine featured personal conversation he has had with family and friends and his inner-ramblings which always garner a few laughs. What took Saikiran’s popularity to another level is that the same routine has been shared on WhatsApp. “The WhatsApp virality has been unimaginable. I don’t know who downloaded it and started sharing it. I know many people have seen the video but don’t know me or even realise that’s actually standup comedy! But it’s great to see that it went viral in different parts of the country not just locally showing again we all have so many shared experiences. Last I checked, it was doing the rounds in WhatsApp groups in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. As far as identity, I am glad at least many people know my face now. Otherwise you never know who is the artiste behind the most viral memes that we all watch and share everyday.”

A Hyderabadi through-and-through, the travelling comedian adds, “One thing you realise as you travel and perform is however much our differences across the length and breadth of the country we have so many shared experiences that unite us. That’s why the same joke that’s written in Hyderabad works in Kottayam and Indore and Delhi.”

That said Saikiran acknowledges the importance of having a digital presence as a standup comedian. “Right now its imperative for a standup comedian to have a digital presence especially with videos on YouTube. People want to be sure they will like the style of comedy before buying tickets for a live experience. So the virality has definitely helped. I did my solo show exactly 15 days prior to the release of my video to a grand total of one person in a furniture shop. Now I get over 100 people to my ticketed events! The only hindrance is having seen the video, many people come expecting more of the same style and content and when I try to explore topics they don’t necessarily relate to or agree with and ultimately wouldn’t respond with the same enthusiasm. But I am glad people are coming to watch me; sometimes repeatedly and it will be interesting to push me and them also into different places with this very unique art form.”

So what is the most common question Saikiran gets from budding comics? “Nowadays they just ask how to go viral,” he laughs.

Tough times

With the ongoing protests and politically sensitive times, is it tough to be a comedian so as not to sound tone-deaf? Do comics have to change up their approaches? “It differs from comic to comic and their audience too. Some comics have audiences who expect them to talk about ongoing issues and will be disappointed if they don’t broach them,” he points out, “Other comics get audiences who come for light entertainment and may not always be keen to have a replay of what’s on the news again. It’s a two-way street, a comic shapes his audience as much as the audience shapes the comic.”

Saikiran adds, that in the early days the comedy audiences were small, adding but also “[A certain market had more exposure] to standup as an art for from watching American television or even having travelled abroad so they were aware of the idiom of standup and understood the concept of comedic license to make fun of very many things. With the explosion of Internet in India and in parallel of standup, a lot of new audiences started watching comedy, but they can’t imagine topics they hold dearly being made fun of, so are quick to take offence. So comics sometimes have to do a tight balancing act.”",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/bqc4m9/article30451021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy29-saikiran-show,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/saikiran-hyderabad-comedian-pure-veg-jokes-viral-on-whatsapp/article30451022.ece
279,2020/01/01,"3,678 people arrested in Kolkata on New Year’s Eve","As many as 3,678 people were arrested from different parts of the city on New Year’s Eve for their alleged involvement in various crimes — ranging from disorderly conduct, to drunk driving, and violation of traffic norms — a senior police officer said.

Of the 3678, 148 were nabbed under non-bailable charges, 531 for drunk driving and rash driving, 654 for triple-riding on two-wheelers and 1289 for not wearing helmets, he said.

They reached the campus on Wednesday wearing black clothes. They staged a mime, demanding that the CAA be withdrawn and asserting that they would fight for a secular India. They also released hydrogen-filled balloons printed with protest slogans.

281,2020/01/01,Class 9 student’s project invokes interest,"E.P. Bhadra, whose project was selected as one of the ‘promising projects for the development of the country’ at the end of the National Children’s Science Congress in the senior category from the State, is a Class 9 student of St. Joseph’s Anglo Indian Girls Higher Secondary School, Kozhikode.

Her project, prepared with Theertha S., was on the possibility of using waste fish scales to remove iron from water.

The idea for the project came to her as the water in the area where her grandmother lived had a high iron content.

Bhadra says build-up of iron in the body can cause a condition called haemochromatosis, affecting the joints and organs such as liver and heart. The permissible level of iron in the body is 0.3 ppm, but in areas such as Kakkodi in Kozhikode district or the coastal areas, the iron content in water could go up to 2 ppm to 3 ppm, she points out.

At her grandmother’s house, the water looked a muddy yellow owing to the iron content. However, the water in which fish was cleaned for the second time looked very clear. This, she found, was because the keratin in the fish scales absorbed iron molecules.

So, Bhadra decided to build a filter to remove iron from water. But first a batch study and a column study were conducted to find the optimum contact time, adsorbent dosage, effect of particle size, optimum flow and so on on the iron content.

Fish scales (washed, soaked in 15% nitric acid and then distilled water, dried and powedered) whose size was in the range of 2 mm to 4 mm showed iron removal efficiency of 67% at 2 ppm, with an adsorbent dosage of 6g a litre and contact time of five hours.

The filter she made comprised a transparent jar which held the water to be treated.

Another small jar contained the fish scales wrapped in gauze. This jar was placed on top of the transparent jar and closed with a lid that had holes in it to allow water to flow through it at the rate of 5ml a minute.

This was then kept inverted on top of a third jar. Water then passed from the transparent jar through the fish scales into the third jar. This treated water was collected through a tap at the bottom of the third jar.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/8gn78d/article30448906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tv-science,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/class-9-students-project-invokes-interest-at-the-national-childrens-science-congress/article30448907.ece
282,2020/01/01,A slice of Persian art at Kerala fest,"Wooden boxes embellished with Persian style painting, some pendants and other wooden artefacts besides miniature paintings constitute the stall of Iran at the Sargaalaya International Art and Craft Festival (SIACF) at the Sargalaya Art and Craft Village at Iringal near here. However, this may not give one a true idea of Persian art.

“The real Persian paintings are very costly. We use real gold in the paintings usually made on papier mache. So I haven’t brought them,” says Sevda Moghaddami, who is the ambassador of Islamic art at the Sargaalaya fest. This research scholar in Islamic Art from Tabriz Islamic Art University in Iran is part of the 9th edition of the festival that began at Iringal last week.

An artist herself, Sevda did her masters in art with a thesis on the art of ancient Ottoman empire. For her doctoral research, she chose to go further into the genre and her research this time is on contemporary Turkish painting, after Turkey became a republic. She is also involved in the restoration of paintings on the walls of old palaces, along with her colleagues.

“Our university is focused on ensuring that we practise what we study. While studying Turkish painting, I should make my own contribution to that field,” Sevda explains.

The university has funded her travel to India and has provided her most of the products to be displayed at the SIACF, though the fund has to be reimbursed later and a percentage of the sale to be remitted at the university.

Sevda has quickly adapted to the hot and humid climate of Kerala and the spicy food. She comes from the chilling cold of Iran. The cooks at Sargaalaya have made the food less spicier for her and other foreign delegates. She was found conspiring with a volunteer about wearing a Saree in the evening.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/scjioe/article30448901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-KI-SARGALAYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/a-slice-of-persian-art-at-kerala-fest/article30448902.ece
283,2020/01/01,Visually challenged get a platform to sell products,"The halls of Lions Aravind Institute of Community Ophthalmology (LAICO) turned into an exhibition centre, selling an array of household products including towels, aprons, bags and bedsheets, on Wednesday.

The event was made special as all products displayed were made by visually impaired members of the Rehabilitation Centre for Blind Women in Mannarpuram, Tiruchi.

Postgraduate students of Ophthalmology from Aravind Eye Hospital turned into enterprising salespersons as they engaged shoppers in discussions about the products.

R. Sarayu Venkatalakshmi, salesperson, said her entire batch looked forward to the event. “It is my second year at the event. As soon as we realised that January 1 was nearing, the batch went into a frenzy and began planning. The best part about the products is that they are affordable and fancy at the same time. The quality of work is fantastic as well,” she said.

All products were of utilitarian value. “When we realise that the money goes to the well-being of these people, shoppers hardly think twice before buying them,” she added.

M. Vanita, a trainer and member of the rehabilitation centre, who was busy making candles with a variety of designs, said visual impairment never stopped her from learning several skills. “I have worked in weaving, candle-making and bag-making departments. Nothing is too difficult after enough training. We have been working towards creating around 40 products for three months now. It is exciting to meet new people here. The stipend we receive is an added bonus.”

Director (Medical Education), Aravind Eye Care systems, N. Venkatesh Prajna, said it was encouraging to see the growing crowds each year for the exhibition. “The exercise is a major learning for PG students. The kind of dedication that these women have is special but their congenital blindness is a matter of shame. I keep telling my students that they must attempt constantly through research to eradicate blindness completely.”

He added that the centre sold products for around ₹3 lakh during the event and hoped that other doctors and students replicated the event in their own hospitals so as to ensure that patients too felt empowered. “This is a whole new way of looking at our patients. It is a necessity as well,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/1n0b1x/article30456951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA02-VAANAVIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/expo-on-household-products/article30453131.ece

289,2020/01/01,Youth murdered in clash during New Year celebrations in Theni,"A youth was murdered in a clash that broke out between two groups during New Year celebrations, near Periyakulam in Theni district, in the wee hours of Wednesday.

The police said that a group of youths were riding two bikes from Jeyamangalam village to Periyakulam, when they were intercepted by another group of youths in Melmangalam village, around 1.30 a.m.

“They had allegedly consumed alcohol on the roadside and were in an inebriated mood as it was New Year’s eve and a sudden quarrel broke out between the youths that escalated into a fist fight. The men from Jeyamangalam village escaped as more men from Melmangalam gathered, but one youth was caught from behind and was beaten to death,” said a police official from Periyakulam sub-division.

The police identified the deceased as K. Karthi (22) of Gandhi Nagar, Jeyamangalam. The body was recovered and sent for a post-mortem to the government hospital in Periyakulam.

The relatives of the victim and villagers staged a road-roko outside the hospital, refusing to take the body and demanded that the accused be arrested.

“A case has been filed under 302 IPC and further investigations are on. We are yet to identify the accused,” said sources in the police.

“There seem to be no previous enmity or motive. But since the deceased is from the Scheduled Caste community, and the accused allegedly belong to an intermediate caste, the situation is tense. We have deployed a number of police personnel in the area to avoid any further trouble,” said Arumugam, DSP, Periyakulam.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/intvku/article30449779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01Periyakulam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/youth-murdered-in-clash-during-new-year-celebrations-in-theni/article30449763.ece
290,2020/01/01,Parking made easy for Ayyappa devotees,"Gone are those days when the city experienced chaotic traffic during November to January when Ayyappa devotees visited Madurai.

Thanks to Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple administration, about five acres of land in Ellis Nagar, close to the temple area, have been ideally put to use exclusively for parking purposes. As many as 400-500 vehicles are parked here without any hindrance to other road users.

At a time when citizens were experiencing harrowing traffic on many of the city’s roads due to development works in progress, the arrangement to park outstation vehicles under single umbrella has come as big relief to road users and also traffic police.

Earlier, outstation vehicles used to be parked on roadside along the bypass stretch and other locations in the city, which reduced carriage space to a great extent and also resulted in traffic congestion during non-peak hours also.

Not just that, for the facility of devotees coming from different parts of Tamil Nadu and neighbouring States such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, the temple administration has constructed bathrooms and restrooms on the same campus.

On an average, the city receives close to 1,000 vehicles — vans, buses and private cars — from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. to have darshan at Meenakshi Temple. Devotees, who arrive in the early hours, can have a bath and hire an auto to reach the temple, officials say.

After darshan, they will return to the parking lot and proceed to the next town, wherein the vehicle is parked safely. Thus, to move around the temple, autorickshaws and shareautos are used. Even TNSTC-operated buses, which drop and pick up pilgrims near the bullion bazaar market, are parked close to the temple.

The idea of restoring the temple land to a productive purpose has to be appreciated as the city, which experiences bottleneck during this season every year, has come as a big relief, said a police officer posted at Periyar bus stand.

Except for those vehicles coming from the direction of Rameswaram, which are permitted to stop around Mariamman Teppakulam, other vehicles coming from Kochadai side, via Samayanallur and Theni Road, are directed to park at the parking lot belonging to Meenakshi Temple.

A police officer in Kamarajar Salai says vehicles coming from Rameswaram parked around Teppakulam. While shopkeepers objected to it, residents claimed that the pilgrims used the road side as open urinal. A bus driver Sekaran from Palaghat says he has been coming to Madurai every year for the last 22 years.

Devotees, after darshan at Sabarimala shrine, visit temple towns such as Madurai, Rameswaram, Palani and so on, which forms a package tour. Every devotee, during this season, has darshan in at least a dozen temples.

“Every year, I visit Madurai during December... Earlier, parking our vehicles was a bitter experience . Now, there is ample space with basic amenities required for pilgrims,” Suresh from Kozhikode said.

“From here we take a share auto to the temple and back...Thanks to the administration,” he stressed.

Officials said that when they took the issue with the Temple Thakkar Karumuttu T. Kannan, they examined the possibilities of improving space ideally for people on pilgrimage.

“We spent about ₹1 crore on cleaning the entire area, laying even surface and constructing toilets/bathrooms,” Mr. Kannan told The Hindu.

Everyday, close to 15,000 people use the facilities almost round-the-clock during this season. An RO plant provides drinking water at a nominal cost, he adds.

There is also a ‘yatri nivas’ adjacent to the car parking space, which can accommodate about 100 pilgrims. Thus, people who wish to stay overnight in the city, can do so by paying nominal fee as rent. Some of the pilgrims from Bangalore point to the menace of touts and brokers in the area. “Even as we repeatedly told the men that we know Madurai and we are familiar with the topography, they insisted on taking us,” Ramprakash, a devotee said. Police should take these people to task as it would help the devotees. Sometimes, the menace of these unauthorised persons brings in bad image for the temple city,” he apprehended and hoped the officials would enforce laws.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/x4q8fv/article30448999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA01-PARKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/parking-made-easy-for-ayyappa-devotees/article30449001.ece
291,2020/01/01,Potters in this tiny hamlet are gearing up for Pongal,"On Tuesday morning, Sundararajanpatti bustles with life as potters of the nondescript hamlet near Alagarkoil on Melur Road are busy gearing up for Pongal.

While men can be seen making clay pots, womenfolk are busy polishing them. Children, too, lend a helping hand to their parents.

With the festival just a fortnight away, there is huge demand for their earthenware across the State. But lack of adequate sunshine over the last three months has slowed down the drying process and resulted in low stock, the potters rue.

S. Solaisamy, 75, who has been in the business since the age of 10, says that every year about 40,000 clay pots are made during the season. Orders are usually placed from Tiruppur, Coimbatore, Erode, Tiruchi, Sivaganaga and Kovilpatti.

“Since the last two years, families here have been using electric pottery wheel instead of the traditional one. This has reduced drudgery and increased productivity,” he says.

Over 15 families have been residing in the hamlet for generations, with every member involved in the craft. Since a young age, boys are taught to make pots and girls to polish them and help in other chores, says Mr. Solaisamy.

On Tuesday, children could be seen polishing and painting the clay pots. “Due to increase in workload, they are lending a helping hand. We cannot recruit people from outside, as the job can only be performed by our community members,” says K. Ramuthai.

If weather conditions are favourable, this profession can guarantee high returns, points out A. Kumar, a potter. “We usually sell a small pot for ₹25. Although there is a huge demand for our pots this year, we cannot increase the price due to less low stock,” he says.

R. Veerakumaran, 22-year-old commerce graduate, says job flexibility and good returns are the main reasons that made him choose the profession over a job in the organised sector. “I can earn as high as ₹1,500 each day and also be an entrepreneur.”

The quality of pots, however, has deteriorated over the years, rues R. Velluchamy, a potter for the last 60 years. “We usually collect clay from tankbeds near our village. But due to indiscriminate mining over the years, it has become difficult to acquire good quality clay,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/m65y1j/article30448986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA01-POTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/potters-in-this-tiny-hamlet-are-gearing-up-for-pongal/article30448988.ece

The toll gate is about 17 km from Mangaluru city on the borders with Kerala.

Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyasa Kamath and Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharat Shetty, who led the workers, said that the Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt. Ltd. (NUTPL), the concessionaire of the about 90-km-long highway widening project between Talapady and Kundapura in Karnataka, had failed to complete the project since over a decade. The service roads and two flyovers under the project remained uncompleted. Hence motorists were facing a hardship. Notwithstanding Nalin Kumar Kateel, Dakshina Kannada MP, arranging ₹56 crore loan to the NUTPL through Axis Bank to complete the prominent Pumpwell flyover in the city, the company had failed to complete it.

The MLAs said that they stopped the toll collection as a symbolic protest to bring pressure on the company to complete the project within this month.

The BJP workers who gathered near the toll gate around 7.30 a.m. forcibly removed the barricades and made the vehicles ply without paying the fee. The workers of the company managing the toll booth did not resist.

The BJP workers said that vehicles would ply without paying toll till about 6 p.m. If the company resumed the collection during the day on Wednesday, the party workers would again forcibly stop it on Thursday, they said.

Shivaprasad Rai, in-charge of toll collection of the company at Talapady, Hejmady and Sasthana on the same highway told The Hindu that the NUTPL collected about ₹7 lakh as toll fee daily at Talapady from over 12,000 vehicles. The loss on Wednesday could be about ₹4 lakh.

The project is being implemented under build, operate and transfer basis.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/nhlx2k/article30449284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bjp-members-at-mangaluru-toll-plaza,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/two-bjp-mlas-forcibly-stop-toll-collection-at-booth-near-mangaluru/article30449285.ece

In such a situation, it was not advisable for the BJP to hold a programme in support of the CAA. “The meeting is likely to flare tempers of the group agitating against the Act.

297,2020/01/01,Whom should a senior citizen approach to get order implemented: HRPF,"Human Rights Protection Foundation (HRPF) president Ravindranath Shanbhag, on Tuesday, asked whom a senior citizen should approach to get the order of the Senior Citizens Tribunal implemented. Many a time, the tribunal passed orders but the implementation of those orders needed to be made effective, he said.

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Shanbhag said that as per Section 5(4) of Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act 2007, an application filed for maintenance and expenses for proceedings shall be disposed of within 90 days from the date of the service of notice of the application to such a person. In senior citizen Bhoja Shetty’s case, the judgment was announced after 14 long months.

The tribunal may, during the pendency of the proceedings regarding monthly allowance for the maintenance, order such children to make a monthly allowance for the interim maintenance of such senior citizen.

“In Mr. Shetty’s case, even though he had stressed that he had no income at all, no such order was passed even though the application was pending for more than 14 months before the tribunal,” Mr. Shanbhag said.

In 2018 itself, most of the children appeared in front of Conciliation Officer and agreed to pay any amount to their father as decided by the tribunal. “Nobody knows what prevented the tribunal to pass at least the interim order for maintenance,” Mr. Shanbhag said.

As per the procedure, the tribunal has to send a copy of the order to the Maintenance Officer appointed under Section 18(1) of the Act. He has to assist and represent the senior citizen during the proceedings of the tribunal.

“In Mr. Shetty’s case, he had to approach the Maintenance Officer and provide him the copy of the judgment. Despite this, no action has been taken to this date,” Mr. Shanbhag said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/whom-should-a-senior-citizen-approach-to-get-order-implemented-hrpf/article30447028.ece
298,2020/01/01,HRPF urges district admn.to help senior citizen,"Human Rights Protection Foundation (HRPF) president Ravindrananth Shanbhag, on Tuesday, that the district administration should take steps to protect a senior citizen Bhoja Shetty (77) who had been abandoned by his children.

Addressing presspersons here, Dr. Shanbhag said that Mr. Shetty had to give up his studies when he was 12 and work as an agricultural labour in order to assist his father and to get his sisters married. He acquired five acres of farmland under Land Reforms Act at Mudradi village in Karkala taluk.

After working for over 35 years, in 1995, as per the advice of his wife, he divided and transferred his agricultural property and his residential house among his children — five sons and two daughters. Seven years ago, he entered into an agreement with them that he be given a monthly allowance of ₹ 2,000 for his maintenance by each one of his five sons.

His two daughters are married, while three of his sons are settled in the hotel industry in Mumbai and Goa. Two years after the agreement, his sons started ill-treating him and nagging him regularly, he said.

Then, they stopped payment of monthly maintenance. Mr. Shetty had to once again start working to get two square meals a day. For the last three years, Mr. Shetty had been working as a watchman in a factory producing concrete blocks at Varanga near Mudradi, he said.

He had to get cataract operated in one of the eyes in a government hospital despite having wealthy sons. He approached the police in Hebri to help him get his monthly compensation for his livelihood as agreed upon by his sons.

The police called his sons and procured a bond that they would provide the monthly maintenance in future. But they never kept their word. Mr. Shetty approached HRPF in October 2018. A complaint was lodged with the Senior Citizens Tribunal in Kundapur. A request was made to direct Mr. Shetty’s sons to provide monthly maintenance as agreed, failing which they should re-transfer the property back to Mr. Shetty.

When notices were served on the sons, they met the Conciliation Officer appointed by the district administration for settlement in December 2018 and assured him of to providing monthly maintenance.

In December 2019, the tribunal gave its verdict directing each one of Mr. Shetty’s five sons to provide monthly maintenance of ₹ 2,000 to their father. It also ordered them to arrange for a rented accommodation for him.

Even after the tribunal’s order, none of Mr. Shetty’s sons remitted any maintenance to their father. Meanwhile, the factory where Mr. Shetty worked closed. He approached the Welfare Officer at the Deputy Commissioner’s Office for implementation of the order of the Senior Citizens Tribunal but to no avail, Mr. Shanbhag said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/87leg7/article30447010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01NUDUPIHRPF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/hrpf-urges-district-admnto-help-senior-citizen/article30447011.ece

300,2020/01/01,"Private buses not to pay toll fee at Talapady, Hejmady from today as a mark of protest","Private bus operators in Dakshina Kannada have decided not to pay toll at the toll booths of Navayuga Udupi Tollway Private Ltd. (NUTPL) on National Highway 66 at Talapady and Hejmady from Wednesday.

It is to protest against NUTPL for failing to complete National Highway No 66 widening project between Talapady and Kundapur and to complete work on service roads.

Announcing this here on Tuesday, Dilraj Alva, president, Dakshina Kannada Bus Operators Association, and Durga Prasad Hegde, vice-president, Canara Bus Operators Association, said that people in general will join them in not paying toll at the two booths.

Mr. Alva said that each bus will have to pay ₹ 35,000 per month as fee at the Talapady booth. About 30 buses will have to pay them just to reach a bus stand a few metres away from the toll booth and return.

At the meeting with NHAI and NUTPL, Member of Parliament and BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel said that he will back the decision by motorists not to pay toll at Hejmady and Talapady.

Mr. Kateel said that as the company has not met the deadlines given to complete the project, he felt that denial of revenue to it is the only way to make it realise the hardships of people.

When Ramesh Y., director, NUTPL, and Shishu Mohan, project director, NHAI Mangaluru Project Office, urged the MP to reconsider his stand as it would push the concessionaire into loss, Mr. Kateel did not agree with them to change his stand.

Later, Mr. Kateel told presspersons that a decision on merging the toll plaza at Surathkal with the one at Hejmady will be taken in a meeting with NHAI in New Delhi on January 6. Other issues relating to FasTAG and giving concession to daily service buses will also be discussed.

301,2020/01/01,Home Minister appeals to outfits to put off protests over CAA in Mangaluru,"Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said on Tuesday that he has appealed to the organisations that have planned anti- and pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in the city on January 4 and January 12, respectively, to postpone them.

Addressing presspersons after a meeting, he said that Muslim organisations in the city, under the banner of the Muslim Central Committee of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, have announced a protest against CAA at Nehru Maidan, near the office of the Deputy Commissioner, on January 4. Meanwhile, the BJP has said that it will organise a pro-CAA protest at the same venue on January 12.

At a meeting with representative of various organisations here on Tuesday, the Minister appealed to them to put off their protests by about 10 days. Both have said that they will think it over, he added.

Mr. Bommai said that in case the organisations want to protest as per their schedule, the Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada and the Police Commissioner would take a call on allowing them and making the necessary security arrangements. Bonds will be taken from the organisationss.

Peace meetings

He also said that once the two protests were over, ward-level peace committee meetings would be organised in the city. “I will personally visit the city during that time to attend some meetings,” he said. There should be no gap between the community and the police, he added.

To a question, he said the government would consider shifting the venue of protests from in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office to any other permanent locality such as Freedom Park in Bengaluru. The Minister was told that earlier, a Deputy Commissioner had proposed the same as processions and protests were coming in the way of traffic management. But it did not become a reality.

On the December 19 chaos in the city, Mr. Bommai said legal action would be initiated against only those who directly involved in the violence. A magisterial inquiry and a probe the Criminal Investigation Department have been ordered into the December 19 violence, as per the guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission, he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/home-minister-appeals-to-outfits-to-put-off-protests-over-caa-in-mangaluru/article30446967.ece
302,2020/01/01,"Contractor, NHAI say work on Pumpwell flyover to be completed by January-end","After failing to meet several deadlines on completing work on the flyover project at Pumpwell, concessionaire of the project Navayuga Udupi Tollway Private Ltd (NUTPL) and National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) have given a fresh joint commitment to the Dakshina Kannada district administration on Tuesday that work will be completed by January 31, 2020.

According to the signed joint commitment, work on Thokkottu side of the flyover will be completed by January 15 and work on Karnataka Bank side of the flyover will be completed by January 30.

NUTPL director Ramesh Y. at a meeting with Nalin Kumar Kateel, Member of Parliament, and NHAI officials, said here on Tuesday that vehicular traffic will be allowed on the flyover on January 31 and the remaining associated works will be completed later.

Mr. Kateel said that earlier NUTPL had given in writing that the work would be completed by first week of January. But it has failed to keep it. Elected representatives and he as an MP had given the maximum cooperation to the company to complete the project. Earlier, it had been given four deadlines.

Mr. Ramesh and NHAI Mangaluru Office Project Director Shishu Mohan agreed at the meeting for external inspection of the timetable given by them to Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh. An engineer from the Public Works Department and a Tahsildar from the Revenue Department will monitor work to ensure this deadline is met, Mr. Kateel told the meeting.

Mr. Kateel said that when the company faced financial issues it was extended a credit of ₹ 56 crore from Axis Bank. An additional ₹ 6 crore to complete work on service roads was also given.

Mr. Ramesh blamed the delay for the prolonged monsoon season this year. “We cannot take up the work of compacting the soil laid for constructing the approach ramps to the flyover if the moisture content is more than 5 %-6 %,” he said.

Mr. Mohan admitted that the concessionaire had received all help from the authorities, including the MP, to ensure timely completion of works.

“Since this project was conceptualised on Build Operate and Transfer basis even before I was first elected MP, it is unfair on the part of the detractors to blame me despite my best efforts,” Mr. Kateel said.

The MP said that those who troll him on the social media for the delay of the project have the right to do so. But he as an MP has made sincere efforts to ensure that the project was completed at the earliest. He did not want to carry out a post-mortem on the issues which delayed the project by blaming others politically. The priority is to complete it at the earliest, he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/2wm77h/article30446965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01MNFLYOVERWORKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/contractor-nhai-say-work-on-pumpwell-flyover-to-be-completed-by-january-end/article30446966.ece

312,2020/01/01,An anatomy of anti-CAA protests,"The passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposal to create a National Register of Citizens (NRC) have galvanised thousands of people in an unparalleled display of anti-government opposition. The spark lit by the protests in Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) has taken the country by storm. Police brutality inside the university’s campus and library gave further momentum to the wave of demonstrations.

Public protests are not uncommon events in India. But, the scale of discontent this time against the redefinition of ‘citizenship’ is quite remarkable. The government has made concerted attempts to suppress these displays of dissent through draconian methods involving widespread Internet shutdowns, arbitrary arrests and ban on assemblies. This scale of repression and extreme use of state power has not been seen since the Emergency. However, the government’s efforts have not deterred protesters; they have flooded the streets in defiance across the length and breadth of the country. That people have not been frightened by these authoritarian methods and by the general tendency of this regime to paint all criticism as anti-national is even more remarkable.

Biggest since 2014

After the unconscionable police action in JMI, political parties such as the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) organised marches and some State governments are now pushing back against the Centre. Still, the acts of dissent do not readily fit the contours of party politics. As of now, these agitations are spontaneous — the largest and most widespread in decades and certainly the biggest since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in 2014. Although they are not organised or coordinated, they represent an extraordinary instance of anti-government forces rallying around the issue of an exclusionary citizenship Bill.

There are three questions that need to be addressed at this juncture. One, how does one explain this historic moment? Two, are these agitations different from other mass protests of the last decade? And, three, what will be their impact on the project of Hindu nationalism?

The CAA is closely related to a key project of the BJP government — the NRC. Despite protestations to the contrary, the NRC remains a crucial part of the BJP’s bid to declare India as a natural home of Hindus. The register aims to identify genuine Indian citizens through a process that could cast doubts on the citizenship of millions of Indians. Consequently, the CAA-NRC has evoked a much sharper reaction than several other recent achievements on the Hindutva list — like the revocation of Article 370, criminalisation of triple talaq and the Supreme Court verdict on the Ram Mandir-Babri Masjid dispute. The unfair discrimination evident in the open espousal by the state of a religious criterion for citizenship has divided the country as nothing else has done in decades. This is the most explicit attempt to push forward a Hindu nationalist agenda. The Home Minister’s repeated assertion in Parliament that the Bill is part of the “unfinished business of Partition”, unequivocally underlined this agenda. This business of ‘righting’ the ‘wrongs’ of Partition goes against the categorical rejection of the two-nation theory by India’s freedom struggle and the secular and inclusive constitutional framework that India adopted despite the surcharged political circumstances in the aftermath of Partition. In fact, it validates the two-nation theory by introducing a religious criterion.

Asserting rights as citizens

There is no doubt that the country’s Muslims, who feel most threatened by this move, are in the forefront of the widespread protests. But the protests started by students of JMI and Aligarh Muslim University have since developed into a much wider opposition. Tens of thousands of people have come out on the streets against CAA-NRC in numerous cities, universities, public squares and maidans to express their opposition to the CAA, with a marked emphasis on upholding the Constitution. Clearly, the rallies are not limited to minority educational institutions or to any particular community. Further, they are taking place outside the framework of identity politics with young men and women, especially at the JMI, articulating their rights as citizens. In other words, these protests have given shape to a new youth identity that is not predicated on community alone.

Economic and governance failures are also stoking dissent. The pent up frustration against the government’s failure to fix the economy provides the broader political context for the discontent that spans a range of issues, from fee hikes to increasing joblessness to purposely created social divisions. The agitations also reflect growing wariness with the decline in freedoms due to the BJP’s authoritarian mindset.

This dramatic moment has been compared to the agitations against Indira Gandhi’s authoritarian rule and to the two major movements of the last decade, the Anna Hazare and Nirbhaya campaigns. But, one point to be noted here is that despite the high stakes, large parts of the country had remained untouched by the earlier protests. Both of them were concentrated in Delhi. Equally, the anti-corruption movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan in the 1970s was limited to certain States.

Broader scope and impact

The anti-CAA protests are appreciably different. The earlier agitations were centred on specific policies and demanded new laws — a Lokpal, for example. The current protests, on the other hand, are not centred on specific policies. They are driven by a disquiet against attempts to define India as a Hindu nation. Furthermore, they are taking place after the passage of the legislation. This difference highlights a deeper issue about the possibilities of opposition when a law is already enacted and legislative channels appear to have run their course. The crucial issue here is related to the significance of public pressure exerted by anti-CAA protests to change the political landscape beyond a repeal of the law. This can happen only when the student protests that sparked this resistance are sustained by an organised political opposition.

These demonstrations have yet to have a tangible effect on the current dispensation as it is unwilling to either listen to or talk to the protesters. But they have already made an emotional impact on the people. The veil of fear that had gripped the country for six years has been lifted. A determined counter-mobilisation cutting across religious lines has begun to challenge the BJP’s Hindutva project. The lines are clearly drawn as the Sangh Parivar’s effort to redefine Indian nationhood has finally provoked a popular upsurge and created unexpected obstacles in the path of a ‘Hindu Rashtra’.

313,2020/01/01,When hospitals become a theatre of police brutality,"Arrogance of power and misuse of authority were on full display when Delhi Police stormed the library at Jamia Millia Islamia in December and indulged in a mindless attack on students. If this shocked the nation, the wanton abuse of power by Karnataka police inside a hospital in Mangaluru a few days later set an even more dangerous precedent.

Shocking video footage has emerged of police personnel inside the hospital charging at people injured during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA). They were also seen trying to force open the door of many wards. There were also reports of a tear gas lobbed inside the hospital building, quite close to the intensive care unit, and two thrown near the parking area inside the hospital premises.

Geneva Convention rules

Even wars have rules of engagement, especially with respect to hospitals. Article 18 of the fourth Geneva Convention, of which India is a signatory, underlines the special protection accorded to hospitals even during times of war. It says: “civilian hospitals organised to give care to the wounded and sick, the infirm and maternity cases, may in no circumstances be the object of attack, but shall at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the conflict.”

The situation in Mangaluru was nowhere even close to a war-like situation and the hospital was in no way being used for acts that could be deemed to be ‘harmful’ to the state. Even if that were the case, the Geneva Convention mandates that protection conferred to hospitals will cease only after “due warning has been given” and after a “reasonable time limit”. Not one of these conditions existed, yet the sanctity of the hospital premises was grossly violated when the police treated it like a conflict zone. It is not yet known what provocation made the police run amok inside the hospital. But it is a fact that three protesters, who had been shot by the police, had been brought to hospital. Two were dead even at the time they were brought and the third person required surgery after sustaining bullet injuries.

Elsewhere, in Delhi, a team of doctors belonging to the Progressive Medicos and Scientists Forum (PMSF), which has been providing medical assistance to protesters, was denied access inside Daryaganj police station for about an hour. Further, near Assam Bhawan, the Delhi police attacked a medical van and detained two volunteers who were providing medical assistance.

IMA’s new-found courage

The Indian Medical Association, which has denounced attacks on hospitals in other countries during armed conflict, condemned police action inside the hospital and for denying protesters access to medical care. “No violence is acceptable in a hospital. Hospitals are sacrosanct and are exempted even in a war zone,” said a statement by the IMA. “Disturbing reports of denial of access to medical care are merging. This is unacceptable. Everyone has the right of access to medical care. The government and its establishment have no right to deny anyone their right of access.”

While the IMA has strongly, rightfully and without delay condemned the police action, that by itself will be insufficient. The possibility of the police, who are not facing any public opprobrium at present, resorting to similar action on medical infrastructure in the future cannot be ruled out.

As an aside, the more surprising element in the IMA statement was its new-found courage to speak truth to power. “The visuals of a policeman violently opening an ICU door by stomping is [sic] a clear indication of the New Truth and the New Standards,” it said. It ended the statement by saying: “Indian doctors will never let down whoever requires care. No politics can dilute this resolve.”

The stand taken was in stark contrast to the IMA’s position on British medical journal The Lancet’s editorial on Kashmir published in August 2019 soon after the dilution of Article 370. The editorial had mainly emphasised on the deaths and gross human rights violations by security forces and armed groups, and the mental health crisis due to prolonged “instability”.

In a letter to Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, the IMA had said the journal had “committed breach of propriety in commenting on [a] political issue” and was interfering in an internal matter of the country. It even questioned the journal’s intention for writing such an editorial.

Nearly five months later, did the near-complete shutdown of the two Union Territories lead to a belated realisation for the IMA of the brewing mental health crisis?

314,2020/01/01,Standing up to on-screen abuse,"At a recent Indian actors’ round-table which featured performers from all over the country, Malayalam film actor Parvathy Thiruvothu stood out for voicing her mind and calling out the misogyny in Indian films. The show featured three actors from south Indian films and five from Hindi cinema, of whom at least four were successful mainstream stars. This says much about the lists we create and how the “bests” are identified. Among the performances featured on the show as ‘one of the finest’ was that of the male lead of the deeply problematic Arjun Reddy (Telugu, 2017).

Parvathy’s comments invited considerable public attention because it is indeed rare for a successful actor to take on misogyny or similar social issues that are wrongly coloured within the cinema ecosystem. That she did so in the presence of her colleagues, who were otherwise engaged in polite conversation about method acting, genre and managing social media, is commendable.

Speaking for publicity

Typically, most Indian actors speak before film releases or parrot tailor made publicity statements. Most media interactions are also engineered with facile questions.

These conversations can sometimes be peppered with lines on women’s empowerment, caste issues, and various forms of exploitation, if they have some bearing on the film in question. Consider the stoic silence of most mainstream leading actors when the country is being ravaged by protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Often, actors tend to pick issues depending on the films they endorse. In most cases, these decisions are influenced by commercial gains and not ideology. A question then arises: is ‘the Indian actor’ largely apolitical? There are a few exceptions, like Swara Bhaskar, Richa Chaddha, Mohd Zeeshan Ayub and many from Malayalam cinema, but the question is to be answered in the affirmative.

At times, purported social concerns of Indian actors are reflected through dalliances with electoral politics but that’s often done primarily for personal gains. On occasion, some have joined politics to save a fledgling career. This is not to suggest that actors ought to be activists or espouse social issues, but their choice of films says a lot about their truest convictions.

Things are however different in the West. In 2017, Meryl Streep used her Golden Globes Award speech to castigate Donald Trump. In 2018, Cate Blanchett delivered a wonderful speech on gender equality at the Cannes Film Festival. In contrast, our award functions are like soap operas where members of the film fraternity smile benevolently from the front rows while their associates accept awards and thank each other.

A marked departure

In a departure, the show referenced above had Parvathy airing her concerns about Telugu film Arjun Reddy, in the presence of the male lead of the film, Vijay Devarakonda. Rejecting the gentle, conversational format that is the norm in these shows, she expressed her discomfort with the portrayal of abuse, camouflaging as love, in films. She also mentioned that cinema shouldn’t be used to mainstream or normalise deviance and violence.

This conversation could be an important beginning to breach the genteel ambience of these shows, where women’s issues are reduced to mere glib talk and celeb-gazing. Lest we forget, Parvathy was also subjected to vicious trolling when she took on Malayalam superstar Mammootty for his depiction of a rogue cop and dialogues denigrating women in the film Kasaba (2016). Along with other comrades, she later contributed to the establishment of the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), which comprises some of the finest talent in contemporary Malayalam cinema. We need many more similar interventions by actors.

315,2020/01/01,In the grip of terror: On al-Shabaab attack in Somalia,"The massive truck bomb attack on December 28, 2019 in Mogadishu that killed at least 79 people and injured 149 points to a resurgent terrorist threat in Somalia. Al-Shabaab, the al-Qaeda-linked terrorist group that was ousted from Mogadishu in 2011 by international forces, has claimed the attack. Shabaab, which still controls parts of the country, has carried out a number of suicide attacks in the recent past. In the deadliest attack in the country, truck bombs killed at least 600 people in Mogadishu in 2017. Shabaab is blamed for this attack too, though it never took responsibility. Early this year, Shabaab militants attacked a hotel complex in Nairobi, Kenya, killing 21 people. The latest assault comes barely two weeks after militants stormed a hotel in Mogadishu, killing five people. The growing number of such attacks, despite the U.S. steadily enhancing its air campaign against Shabaab and other militants in the country in recent years, have not only exposed the inability, if not incompetence, of the federal government in ensuring security but also sent a message to the government’s regional and international backers that their attempts to get a stable government in the Horn of Africa country are reaching nowhere.

Somalia has hardly been stable since the fall of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. With different clans and militia groups vying for influence and power, the country plunged into a cyclical civil strife. The U.S. sent troops in in 1992 as part of an international humanitarian and peacekeeping mission, but it pulled out of the country in 1994 after 18 American soldiers were killed in the ‘Black Hawk Down’ incident. Shabaab rose from the anarchy that prevailed over the country. It spread its influence fast across Somalia, capturing even Mogadishu, until U.S. and African Union troops ousted it. Since then, the group has been attacking the internationally-backed federal government and the people residing in government-controlled areas through guerrilla and terror strikes. The original regional plan was to establish a government that will stabilise the country and take over the fight against terrorists. But the Somali government is accused of corruption, incompetence and infighting. While Shabaab exploits the chaos and lawlessness, other militant groups, including an Islamic State faction, are on the rise. Security is largely taken care of by the African Union Mission in Somalia, which has stated that it is preparing for “condition-based handover of national security responsibility” to the Somali government. So fragile is the security situation that it is doubtful whether the Somali government could hold itself together if the international troops pull out. To arrest the slide in security, the government has to first get its act together. The African Union should continue to back the government, as Shabaab poses a threat not just to the Somali government but to the whole region.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/in-the-grip-of-terror-on-islamist-terror-in-somalia/article30446188.ece
316,2020/01/01,A group of theocracies: On why India should rebuff OIC on Kashmir,"The improvement in India’s ties with the Gulf countries is often cited as a major success of the present government. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s focus on relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which he has visited more than once in his tenure, and his personal ties with their most powerful royals, has yielded accolades and promises of investment. In March 2019, it resulted in then External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj addressing the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Abu Dhabi, a breakthrough for India. The government’s outreach to the grouping was seen as a way of strengthening ties with the “Muslim world” including West Asian countries where more than six million Indians live and work. It was therefore disappointing for the government to note that in June, the OIC appointed a “special envoy” on Jammu and Kashmir, and subsequently issued several strongly worded statements on the government’s decision to amend Article 370 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court verdict on the Ayodhya dispute and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or the CAA. And last week, according to Pakistani officials, the OIC decided to convene a special meeting in Islamabad in 2020 to discuss the Kashmir issue and the repercussions of the CAA, after discussions the Saudi Foreign Minister had in Islamabad. It should be clear to the government that the engagement with the grouping this year was a miscalculation. In any case, the basis of the OIC is a unity between theocratic Muslim states, an idea that India, as a secular country with a large Muslim population has never been aligned with. At all costs, attempts by the OIC to make statements and arrogate to itself the well-being of India’s Muslims must be rebuffed as gross interference.

However, New Delhi must note that the OIC’s recent statements also stem from a broader tussle within the grouping that has become a concern for traditional leaders, the KSA and the UAE. The challenge comes chiefly from Malaysia, where Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has revived his plans for a “reformed” OIC, and has enlisted other challengers to the Riyadh-Abu Dhabi domination of the pan-Islamic movement including Iran, Turkey and Qatar. In that sense, the OIC’s criticism of India is a clear attempt at reaffirming its leadership of the movement. New Delhi must strengthen ties with its strategic partners in the region on both sides of the divide without taking sides or becoming collateral damage in the internecine warfare between them. But it must also be wary of groupings with nothing in common other than a religious world view.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-group-of-theocracies-on-why-india-should-rebuff-oic-on-kashmir/article30446185.ece

318,2020/01/01,BBMP planning stiffer penalties for not segregating waste,"The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike is contemplating making stiffer penalties for not segregating waste at source. This, the civic body, hopes will ensure that more citizens take to segregating waste.

Currently, waste segregation level in the city stands at around 40%. Though the BBMP has, time and again, appealed to citizens to segregate waste at source, as mandated under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, not many have actually taken to it.

The BBMP had decided to levy fines on those who fail to segregate from January 1 and directed pourakarmikas to not pick up mixed waste. As of now, the fine for not segregating waste is ₹500 for the first offence and it may be increased to ₹1,000 for subsequent offence.

BBMP Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) D. Randeep told reporters on the sidelines of ‘TrashURe Hunt’ on Wednesday that the civic body was trying to act against mismanagement of waste. “If residents complain that the collectors are aggregating the segregated waste, we will initiate stringent action against the collectors as well,” he said, and added that the penalties would apply on the residents and pourakarmikas as well. If there were large-scale violations on part of the contractors, the contract would be terminated, he said.

He pointed out that there were many communities and localities in the city that had taken to segregation of waste and even decentralised processing of the waste generated. “There are some wards where the segregation levels are at 85%, such as Sanjaynagar (ward no. 18) and Koramangala (ward no. 151). The segregation levels are high in wards with strong residents’ welfare associations who take self-ownership and work with the BBMP. There are some wards where the segregation levels are not even 10%,” he said.

Mr. Randeep said residents could complain to the civic body if any contractor or waste collector is asking them to give mixed waste or aggregating the segregated waste. “Our efforts to get everyone on board will continue. We hope to achieve maximum segregation at least by the end of this calendar year,” he added.

Citizens may call the BBMP control room on 080-22660000, send a WhatsApp message to 9480685700, or share photo and location by tweeting to @bbmpsplcomm.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-planning-to-make-penalties-prohibitive-for-non-segregation/article30453831.ece
319,2020/01/01,Metro services now available till midnight,"Namma Metro services are available till midnight with effect from Wednesday. Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) had announced an extension in services last year.

On both Purple and Green lines, the BMRCL will operate six-coach trains during the extended hours. The last train from Mysuru Road station now leaves at 11.40 p.m., Baiyappanahalli at 11.35 p.m., Nagasandra at 11.25 p.m., and from Yelachenahalli at 11.35 p.m. The last train from Majestic interchange station leaves at 12 a.m. in all the four directions.

Shankar A.S., Executive Director (Operations and Maintenance), BMRCL, said the new services were introduced based on the demand from the public. “It is difficult to say how many people will benefit from the extended services. We are operating trains at a frequency of 15 minutes. Depending on the patronage, we will take a decision on increasing the frequency.”

On the other hand, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation too has decided to operate more feeder services from metro stations.

320,2020/01/01,City scores poorly in Swachh Survekshan League,"Having scored poorly, Bengaluru finds no mention among the top cities in Swachh Survekshan (SS) League 2020. The results of the SS League 2020 (quarters 1 and 2) were announced on Tuesday.

The city’s rank in Q1 is 2,768 and in Q2 is 910. Of the 280 cities in Karnataka, Bengaluru is ranked 62 in Q1 and 24 in Q2.

The SS League 2020 was introduced with the objective of sustaining the on-ground performance along with continuous monitoring of service-level performance when it comes to cleanliness.

SS 2020 League is evaluated on a quarterly basis — Q1 (April, May, June), Q2 (July, August, September), and Q3 (October, November and December). Officials said while Q1 and Q2 added up to 300 marks, Q3 carried the maximum of 1,000 marks.

SS 2020 carries a total weightage of 6,000 that are divided equally into four areas. “SS 2020 goes too much into technicalities, documentation, and updation. The BBMP was supposed start documentation from April, but, we started from September. This could be one of the reasons for the poor performance,” officials said.

Officials said the civic body hoped to score well in the remaining 5,700 marks that are under evaluation.

“We have completed all procedures and documentation required for Q3. We believe that our score (out of 1,000) will be good.”

The SS 2020 is likely to begin from January 4 and the final results will be released in March. “This is not the final ranking. There is much scope to do well. The BBMP is surely but slowly taking steps to streamline solid waste management system in the city,” officials said.

The civic body has also appointed an expert from Indore, which has been consistently been topping Swachh Survekashan, to help improve the city’s ranking. This move has, however, upset waste management experts in the city who feel they have been sidelined. However, the BBMP seems intent on replicating the Indore model in the city. As such, five wards have been taken up for a pilot. If successful, the model will be scaled up across the city.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/city-scores-poorly-in-swachh-survekshan-league/article30453662.ece

To a question on doing away with Deputy Chief Minister posts, he said there was no need to give importance to such talk as the issue is not being discussed at party forums.

323,2020/01/01,What Bengaluru wants this New Year,"As the city welcomes a new year and a new decade, Bengalureans are hoping for some big and small changes: from the completion of big infrastructure projects to the protection of the city’s environment.

Integrated mobility plan

Will there be respite from traffic jams in 2020? The vehicle population in the city has already crossed 83 lakh, indicating that many continue to rely on private modes of transport.

There has been a demand for a robust suburban rail network for years, but the matter is still pending before the Central Cabinet for final approval. Mobility experts are now hoping that the special purpose vehicle would get required financial support from both centre and state government.

Meanwhile, the extended metro line on Kanakpura Road and Mysuru Road will be operational by 2020. If BMRCL delivers its promise, it will help lakhs of citizens make the shift to public transport. The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) is also expected to operate 6,000 electric buses in a phased manner and reduce existing fares.

Revival of waterbodies

The government and its agencies were repeatedly pulled up by the NGT for the state of the highly-polluted Bellandur and Varthur lakes, and the city hopes that words translate into action for a better future for these lakes this year.

The BBMP, which now has 37 more lakes under its purview in addition to 169 lakes, is hoping for involvement from citizens and corporates to help revive and maintain the city’s waterbodies. Setting up of STPs and removal of encroachments around lakes are basic steps that need to be taken. Citizen participation in the revival processes, which has reaped rich results in the cases of Puttenahalli and Kaikondarahalli lakes, could also help bring back the city’s keres to their glory days.

New garbage tenders, visual cleanliness

The city needs the BBMP to put in place the new garbage tenders that envisage separate collection of different streams of waste. Also, there needs to be a bigger push towards segregation of waste at source, which will make decentralised processing possible.

With increased segregation and decentralised processing, the civic body will also be able to rely less on landfills and quarry pits.

Completion of pending projects

The city has many long-pending projects that urban experts hope will finally take off, such as the Peripheral Ring Road and Satellite Township Ring Road (STRR).

While the Cabinet has approved PRR, the BDA is also looking at raising funds through regularising encroachments on over 5,000 acres of its lands across 69 layouts, which will be used for PRR. The NHAI has promised financial assistance for STRR. A section is also hoping the 102 km elevated corridor network is scrapped.

More green cover

Over 3,500 trees slated to face the axe to make way for ‘development projects’.

In 2019, active citizens were successful in getting the government to scrap or put on the backburner many big ticket projects that threatened huge loss of green cover. Objections have already started pouring in for new proposals. Bengalureans hope to play a key role in ensuring that governance does not forget to factor in environmental concerns while planning infrastructure projects. The city will also hope that the long-pending tree census will take off this year.

Boost in police-public relationship

The Bengaluru police needs more personnel to be on a par with the increasing population. This will bring down stress level and reduce additional workload of the ground level police personnel.

The special units of the city police need to focus more on drug menace and cyber crimes that pose challenges to the force. To bring transparency and boost police-public relationship, more community policing initiatives should be implemented.

Traffic management is another area of concern with the traffic police having minimal force and struggling to ensure the smooth flow of traffic. Better coordination with civic agencies will improve the traffic condition in the city.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/o9kf8f/article30447155.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGBLRGARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/what-the-city-wants-this-new-year/article30447163.ece

325,2020/01/01,Chennai rings in 2020 with rains,"Hours after ringing in the New Year with much cheer, joy and fireworks, residents of Chennai woke up to a pleasant surprise as heavy rains descended on the city.

Around 6 a.m., showers began in several areas of the city including Nungambakkam, Arumbakkam, Choolaimedu, Cathedral Road, Mylapore, Royapettah, T. Nagar and Maduravoyal. The few hours of the rains saw Nungambakkam getting about 2 cm of rains and Chennai Airport 3 cm. The weather station in Satyabhama College, in Kancheepuram district, recorded the maximum of 4 cm followed by Kolappakkam with 3 cm while Tambaram and Sriperumbudur got 2 cm each of rains respectively.

Meteorological department officials said these rains are the result of Northeast monsoon activity and are likely to taper off in a few days. S. Balachandran, Deputy Director General of Meteorology said, “This Northeast monsoon for the city was much better than the previous year; we received around 63 cm of the rainfall between October and December, against the normal of 76 cm.”

He noted that of the three months, the city got maximum rains in October with 28 cm in October while November and December saw 14 cm and 21 cm rainfall respectively.

“The sky condition is likely to be generally cloudy. Light to moderate rain is likely to occur in some areas. Maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to be around 29 and 24 degree Celsius respectively,” the meteorological department said.

Other activities

Azeem Ahmed, Deputy Chief Traffic Warden of TNPTWO, said the traffic wardens also take up other awareness activities including propaganda against drunken driving by distributing pamphlets using the RSP teams and holding rallies to promote wearing of helmets.

While the wardens and officers of TNPTWO work on a voluntary basis, the office-bearers rue the gradual reduction in the number of traffic wardens because no recruitment has happened for over four years.

Mr. Ahmed said the the number of wardens had come down from 265 to 190, and this was worrisome.

He said the selection of wardens would be initiated in the coming year. He also said not many students were showing interest in joining the RSP.

328,2020/01/01,Poor students receive scholarships,"Scholarships worth ₹84.70 lakh were distributed to students by the Universal Higher Education Trust (UHET) at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore on Tuesday.

UHET was established eight years ago to extend a helping hand to meritorious students from poor families for pursuing higher education.

It was started with the aim of ensuring that students who secured admission in higher educational institutions on successful completion of Class XII, did not discontinue their education owing to their inability to pay fees.

Former vice-chancellor of University of Madras, R. Thandavan handed over the scholarships.

He asked the students to make use of their education for the development of the region as well as the country.

VIT chancellor and president of UHET G. Viswanathan said scholarships totalling ₹84,70,000 was distributed to 1,537 students through the trust during the current academic year.

Women beneficiaries

Two-third of the total number of beneficiaries are women. Mr. Viswanathan added that the trust, which was initially launched in Gudiyatham and K.V. Kuppam, was now extended to all 13 Assembly constituencies in Vellore district.

He pointed out that education for women plays a vital role in the development of a nation.

“Any country that gives importance to higher education of women will become an economically developed one,” he said.

This was the ninth case of ABO incompatible living-related renal transplantation performed at the hospital. According to dean P. Vasanthamani, the patient, a 25-year-old man, had ‘B positive’ blood group, while his mother was ‘A positive’.

The patient was also registered for a kidney under the deceased donor programme. “But the minimum waiting period for a kidney is three to five years,” he added. The mother volunteered to donate her kidney, and doctors prepared the patient for ABO incompatible renal transplant.

Plasma exchange

“In such cases, where the patient and donor belong to different blood groups, the transplanted kidney could start to malfunction immediately, as the antibodies in the recipient’s blood will act against the organ. This is called hyperacute rejection that could occur within a few seconds of the transplant. Hence, we remove the antibodies in the recipient’s blood through a process called plasmapheresis or plasma exchange,” said T. Balasubramaniyan, chief nephrologist, KMC.

332,2020/01/01,"Children help ease traffic police burden, regulate school zones","Regulating traffic is slowly but surely becoming a public task. In fact, at many places in the city, students are pitching in to bring order to traffic flow, at least in and around schools.

Limited resources have put the city traffic police in a bind, leaving them open to taking any assistance from any quarter.

The toughest challenge is regulating traffic in school zones — especially when schools open and close each day. With most schools located on arterial roads, or abutting significant, busy stretches, policing such zones is admittedly a tough task.

Traffic jams

Motorists in areas such as T. Nagar, Perambur, Ayanavaram, Kilpauk, Valasaravakkam, Ashok Nagar, Madipakkam and Velachery face hardship thanks to traffic jams around schools zones. The problem is compounded in internal roads.

While some schools have buses to ferry children, most rely on personal vehicles to bring children to school in the morning and take them home in the evening. While some private schools employ their own security personnel to regulate traffic, they can do little to reduce the ensuing chaos.

The NGO, Tamil Nadu Police Traffic Warden Organisation (TNPTWO), has come forward to assist the traffic police during peak hours. It is also tasked with the job of selecting and training schoolchildren for Road Safety Patrol (RSP) teams.

The main job of an RSP team in a school is to regulate traffic around the school zone in an organised manner.

Heavy workload

A senior police official said the workload of the traffic police has been increasing with the personnel being drawn for manning VIP routes, managing traffic during peak hours at the hundreds of junctions and conducting vehicular checks to make motorists comply with various regulations.

In such a situation, deputing personnel for organising traffic movement in school zones even if they are located on arterial roads has become a tough task, the senior police officer added.

Harish L. Metha, Chief Traffic Warden of the TNPTWO, said nearly 200 traffic wardens are involved in voluntarily assisting the city traffic police at important junctions.

The 60-year-old said the wardens who have a dress code similar to the regular police are involved in recruiting and training RSP teams and creating awareness among schoolchildren about the various traffic regulations.

A group of six to nine children from classes 7 to 11 from each participating school is selected and given training to manage traffic in school zones.

‘Doing well’

The police official said the RSP teams trained by the traffic wardens have been doing well in several private schools, especially on Kolathur Main Road, Thirumalai Pillai Road in T. Nagar, Anna Nagar, Kilpauk and Ashok Nagar.

The police official said the TNPTWO with the help of traffic police has enrolled a total of 470 schools and trained more than 19,000 students for managing the traffic in school zones.

He added that the highest number of schools enrolled in the city is in the west zone — 141 schools with 6,900 students, followed by south zone with 135 schools and 6,100 students, north zone with 113 schools of 3,500 students and the east zone with 81 schools and 2,700 students.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/es5cpw/article30447214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/REV-Helping-handscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/children-help-ease-traffic-police-burden-regulate-school-zones/article30447215.ece
333,2020/01/01,IIT-M’s Shaastra to be held from January 3 to 6,"The 20th edition of Shaastra, Indian Institute of Technology-Madras’ technical festival, will be held from January 3 to 6. It will focus on technological innovations in defence and artificial intelligence to develop assistive devices for the visually impaired and the elderly.

The theme for this year is ‘Parsec to Plank’, focusing on creating small-size solutions, keeping in tune with the current technological innovations.

The student-run event has lined up a defence tech summit which includes spotlight lectures by V.K. Saraswat, former director general of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and economist Lord Meghnad Desai.

As many as 40 events and 30 workshops are scheduled, said Pravallika Kollipara, the institute’s co-curricular affairs secretary.

Aeromodellig contest

Boeing’s national aeromodelling competition and Indian drone racing league are events to look forward to. There will be an exhibition featuring student innovations, startups by the visiting teams too.

The students have introduced Assistive Technology makeathon in collaboration with the institute’s TTK Centre for Rehabilitation Research and Device Development (R2D2) that developed the country’s first indigenously designed standing wheelchair.

The makeathon is looking for innovations that would enhance the quality of life for the elderly, adults and children with disabilities. Successful prototypes designed by students could be put to use.

Event run by students

Institute director Bhaskar Ramamurthi said the event is completely run by students and a faculty plays an advisory role.

“Internally, we have an active hub of co-curricular activity for building gadgets. We hve a centre for innovation and a lot of activities are related to Shaastra. They are just part of the institute and connected to Shaastra. Through Shaastra they learn to go beyond the classroom and reach out to a large student community across the country. Everybody benefits, we learn and our students learn along with the visiting students,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qm8ewm/article30294695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13DECTH-IITMADRAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iit-ms-shaastra-to-be-held-from-january-3-to-6/article30447192.ece

335,2020/01/01,"Corporation takes up pothole repairs at over 1,000 locations","Pothole-ridden roads are nothing new for residents of north Chennai.

The Chennai Corporation recently identified potholes, and has taken up patchwork at more than 1,000 locations on non-bus route roads in the five zones.

According to officials, 1,386 locations on non-bus route roads were identified for repair works, with the area being 24,918 sq m. While work has been completed in the identified locations in two zones, patchwork is on in other areas.

A cross-section of residents in parts of north Chennai, like Tondiarpet, Mathur and Vyasarpadi, said that in addition to portions of many arterial roads, interior roads too were damaged. “Some interior roads in Vyasarpadi are in a bad shape and should be repaired before they get worse,” said Moorthy, a resident.

A resident of Mathur said there were a number of interior roads that were badly damaged in and around Manali. “Here, a main road like Pada Salai, which is a bus route, is damaged, and there are some interior roads that are in such a bad condition that autos and cars cannot ply on them,” he said.

In Zone I (Tiruvottiyur), the Corporation has identified a total of 211 locations, where repair works are required. Of this, patchwork was completed in 21 locations, and work is in progress in 10.

Work in progress

In Manali (zone II), the Corporation has completed 65% of patchwork in the identified locations.

A total of 135 locations were identified. Of these, patchwork was completed in 89 locations.

Patchwork has been completed in all 728 locations identified in Madhavaram (Zone III).

In Zone IV (Tondiarpet), patchwork was completed in 70 of the total 173 identified locations, and work was completed in 139 identified locations in parts of Zone V (Royapuram), officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jacuaz/article30447151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1THROAD2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corporation-takes-up-pothole-repairs-at-over-1000-locations/article30447152.ece

“Already the supply was erratic. It was stopped abruptly and we did not get any proper response when we called TNSCB officials,” said S. Anuradha, a resident.

Many like her said that they could not celebrate Christmas properly due to lack of water. “We could not cook good dishes at home. Most of us have been purchasing food from outside to avoid cleaning utensils,” she added.

Residents said that they have been purchasing water cans for the past five days. “We can afford only two cans a day and we are forced to use it in the toilet. Many residents have not bathed or cooked food due to the lack of water supply,” said N. Paramasivam, a resident.

People are also angry as they do not get any proper response from TNSCB officials. “The officials just told us that there was some repair and supply will be restored in few days,” he added.

TNSCB officials clarified that the fault was fixed. “A few days ago, some contract workers of Engineering Projects India Limited, working in the resettlement colony, damaged a water pipeline,” an official said, claiming that the water supply has been restored.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/water-woes-hit-perumbakkam-tenements/article30447136.ece
339,2020/01/01,Weighing in on the public sector privatisation debate,"There seem to be broadly three positions with respect to the privatisation of public sector undertakings (PSUs). The left position is “PSU is family silver and should not be sold irrespective of its performance”. The divergent stand is that “business is not the business of government”, which found resonance in the United Kingdom, and, of late, in India. There is also the third position: Why privatise profit-making PSUs? Why do you sell the family silver? Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) which is making handsome profits, comes under this category.

Case of loss-making units

Loss-making PSUs certainly merit privatisation — but no one would buy them with their huge debt and employee liabilities. The government may even have to pay the buyer, as it happened in the case of the Delhi Discom privatisation. Even then it may be worth it, since privatisation will stop fiscal flows to these PSUs. Alternatively, there is the exit route through the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

Some of the major loss-making PSUs, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited and Air India should go under the block as their losses are greater than their revenue. The Economist has a term for such entities — value subtracting enterprises. Restructuring them and even ensuring an additional infusion of funds and other resources have not produced results. Their chairmen cum managing directors are bureaucrats who may not have domain knowledge or technical service people bereft of business acumen. Justifying their existence — in the case of BSNL/MTNL which ran telecom at one time as a government monopoly, with a teledensity of 0.01% — by citing national security is strange. At one time the argument was that BSNL alone maintains the military telecom network. It was for the same reason that the private sector was not allowed to operate in the defence sector; we have paid a heavy price for only entrusting it to the public sector in this area. The present government has by and large done well in opening up defence to the private sector.

Privatisation is not a default option; rather, it is resorted to only out of extreme necessity. As World Bank consultants said on the Delhi Discom privatisation: “Privatization is resorted not just when the firm makes losses, but only when the physical performance is so bad that the PSU becomes a political embarrassment to the Government.” This may explain the hesitation to privatise some of the largest loss-making PSUs — Air India, the BSNL and MTNL — as the embarrassment threshold may not have been reached as yet.

Meeting fiscal targets

But why privatise a profit-making PSU. What comes into play here is not the lofty “business is not the business of government” argument, but a more mundane fiscal imperative. The Finance Minister’s disinvestment target of a little over a lakh of crores for the current fiscal has to be met. It is this fiscal requirement that now drives privatisation. Let us revisit the question: Should profit-making PSUs be privatised? It is good to remember what former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once said on the issue. He made the assurance that the government would not “privatise profit making PSUs working in competitive environments”. That is, if the output price is a competitive price and you still make a profit, then you are efficient and the need to privatise does not arise.

But if the output price is set in a monopoly background — the case now being the monopoly cartel of the oil majors, BPCL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited — with the autonomy given being used for monopoly pricing, then your profit is no longer an index of your efficiency. In that case, privatisation will still bring in benefits of the efficient operation of private sector through reduced costs. Examples of PSUs that made monopoly profits and still inefficient were Coal India and Indian Airlines (IA). For IA, there was poor punctuality, high staff-to-plane ratio, high operating costs and overall customer indifference.

The BPCL is not inefficient but its privatisation still offers scope for improvement. When a company such as this has never faced any serious competition, it is impossible to even discuss the issue of efficiency or inefficiency. There is no comparable firm in the private sector to benchmark it with.

However if one looks at just about any public sector company in India, it is impossible to argue that the BPCL can be an exception. Over the years, the financial performance of oil marketing companies has undergone a bureaucratic process called “administrative price mechanism”. All one can say is that the oil PSUs have been allowed to make profit; if one can use The Economist’s phrase again, they can be called “allotted millionaires”. On the non-financial performance side, it would be difficult for the BPCL to show what innovations it has implemented over the years either in marketing or refinery operations.

Accompanied by competition

There is no point in converting a public monopoly to a private monopoly; it will only result in inefficiency being replaced by private profits. Privatisation must be accompanied by competition in the post-privatised scenario.

However, the government will face a dilemma. If you want a high price, you must allow a monopoly situation post-privatisation, and if you want competition and low price for consumers, you must be content with a modest sale price, as the post-privatisation valuation of the firm critically depends on the market structure post-privatisation. If that is to be competitive, other PSU national oil companies such as the IOC and HPCL should also be privatised. There is also no issue of national security for downstream oil firms. Oil marketing companies, even if they are not in the public sector, can be made to own strategic petroleum reserves as in most of Europe and by the government itself as in the U.S. Thus privatising the BPCL does not compromise India’s national security.

Similarly, LPG and kerosene subsidies can be handled by direct benefit transfer, which is already in vogue in the case of LPG.

Finally, there is an argument advanced in the case of the BPCL: that the government paid about ₹622 crore in today’s money to acquire it, while it now has a market value of around ₹85,000-1,15,000 crore. How did ₹622 crore balloon into this amount even after the time value of money adjustment? Is it a bargain one cannot refuse? Not quite. After all, in the interim period of many years, the firm would have invested, out of retained profits, and also generated further monopoly profits for dividends which explains its increased value. This is not by its virtue of being a PSU. The BPCL is not a golden goose. It may be an ATM.

340,2020/01/01,It is everybody’s Constitution,"In early 1948, the draft of the Indian Constitution was made publicly available. For many months, feedback, suggestions, and proposals for amendments poured in from across the country: from provincial governments, local bar associations, organised groups, and even individual citizens. The Drafting Committee, chaired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, considered these proposals in detail, recorded its responses, and on more than one occasion, changed the constitutional text. It was this revised draft that was debated by the Constituent Assembly, and eventually became the Constitution of India.

From public participation

Thus, the Indian Constitution was born in an act of public participation. This public participation had begun with the mass movements of the freedom struggle, and culminated in a dialogue between the framers of the Constitution, and the Indian public. It is this history that gives life to those famous words of the Constitution’s Preamble: “We the People of India... do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution.”

And this history tells us something else. The Indian Constitution was never intended to be the sole preserve of lawyers and judges. Constitutional dialogue was never meant to be confined to the courtroom and be limited to arguments framed in the formal language of law. The Constitution is not merely a legal document but a charter of values and principles; a vision of a free, just, and equal society. And it is a vision that is not static in time, but subject to constant renewal as each generation discovers anew, through discussion and debate, the founding principles of our Republic.

Constitution and the CAA

It is this idea of the Indian Constitution that has come to the forefront during the recent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, or the CAA, 2019, the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the National Population Register (NPR). These protests have been sounded in a diversity of registers: but an important tone has been that of the Constitution. In gathering across India, for example, the Preamble of the Constitution has been read out in public. The Preamble, of course, is not a legally binding document. The CAA, 2019 cannot be struck down if it is found to violate the Preamble.

But the Preamble is something more than that: in its declarations of universal justice, of equality, and of fraternity, it speaks to us of the kind of country that we aspire to be. Invocations of the Preamble, therefore, hold the CAA to a higher standard than that of formal legal validity. They tell us that this conversation is not simply about whether the CAA passes the basic minimum threshold of not being unconstitutional, but whether it is worthy of the Nation that we set out to be in 1947, the ideals of our freedom struggle, and of course, the values and principles that speak to us today.

In public protests, we also hear repeated invocations of Article 14 of the Constitution. Legally, the debate around Article 14 turns upon whether or not the CAA has drawn a “reasonable classification” (although the understanding of “reasonableness” has evolved significantly in the Supreme Court of India’s jurisprudence over the last few years). There are, of course, powerful arguments for why the CAA fails the test of reasonable classification. However, Article 14, with its majestic promise of equality before the law to all persons, is about much more than formal legal doctrine. Indeed, this was recognised by the Supreme Court itself. As early as 1952, while considering an Article 14 argument, Justice Vivian Bose asked “whether the collective conscience of a sovereign democratic republic can regard [a disputed law]... as the sort of substantially equal treatment which men of resolute minds and unbiased views can regard as right and proper in a democracy of the kind we have proclaimed ourselves to be.”

As Justice Bose realised all those years ago, debates around equality cannot avoid deeper questions about the nature of our democracy, and what it means for human beings to be treated justly and fairly. And these are not debates that can be settled in courtrooms, but rather, in enduring public conversation between citizens. As Jawaharlal Nehru said, at the very beginning of the Constitution’s framing, “words are magic things... but even the magic of words sometimes cannot convey the magic of the human spirit”. The conversation around the CAA, then, takes us beyond the words of the Constitution — and the historical baggage they carry after a few decades of judicial interpretation — and asks us about the “magic of the human spirit” that gave them their place in the constitutional text.

Beyond the courtroom

It is in this sense that the Constitution belongs to everyone, and that the ongoing protests can be best understood as acts of reclamation. One is reminded of a famous historical story: in the 1830s, anti-slavery activists in the United States made a remarkable claim. They argued that slavery was prohibited by the American Constitution, which had been born in a moment of revolutionary struggle against an oppressive power. And they made this claim in the teeth of a deeply hostile Supreme Court, which would soon proclaim that slavery was, on the contrary, written into the American Constitution.

But it is the beauty of the Constitution, with its ringing invocation of universal values, that allowed the American abolitionists the space to make that argument in the first place. And while they would be rebuffed by a judiciary that was, at the time, committed to upholding slavery, it was their humanitarian and egalitarian vision that eventually triumphed after a few decades, and was formally written into the Constitution. A century and a half later, history has given its decisive verdict: the abolitionists were right. The Supreme Court got it wrong. And closer home, we have the inspiring example of the LGBTQ+ community, whose determined protest and activism after the Koushal judgment helped the Indian Supreme Court correct its own error, and finally decriminalise same-sex relations in 2018.

These stories tell us that while different institutions can take different views about what the Constitution says, no one institution exercises a monopoly over constitutional truth or wisdom. And this is why it is so vital for constitutionalism to exist, live, and thrive, outside the domain of institutions. The CAA protests have shown us what a dynamic and evolving conversation about the Constitution, and about constitutional values, can look like. It is for us, now, to take this conversation further.

Responses to the protests have taken many forms. One, of course, has been a full-blooded defence of the CAA (and of the NPR and the NRC), on their merits. But there has been another response: that because the constitutional challenge to the CAA is sub judice before the Supreme Court, there is no sense in protesting. The Supreme Court will decide the case, one way or another.

But this argument — as we have seen — misunderstands the history that culminated in the framing of the Constitution, and indeed, misunderstands the nature of the Constitution itself. What is before the Supreme Court is a narrow question: does the CAA meet the minimum threshold that qualifies it to be a validly enacted law? To that, the Court will give a narrow answer: “yes”, or “no”. Whatever that answer will be, it does not even begin to exhaust the range, the scope, and the sheer diversity of the conversations that we have been having over the last few weeks. What the court will do — when it hears and decides the case — is declare the law of the land. That declaration, however, will be a legal one: the Citizenship Act will stay or it will go. But whether it stays or goes, the Constitution will remain: everybody’s Constitution.

343,2020/01/01,Paying for the damages,"There is no dispute about the democratic right of aggrieved people protesting for a cause. But while doing so, it should be ensured that public property is not damaged which is made up of tax payers’ money. However, in India, an agitation is considered successful only if considerable damage is done to public property. Political parties which protest for reasons of safeguarding the interests of common man, ironically show no remorse when it comes to the loss on the exchequer due to arson and looting, while the common man has again to bear the loss through additional taxes. It is time the judiciary intervenes and frames rules to make political parties or any one resorting to any type of agitation to make good the loss to the damaged public property.

Existing judicial dictates do not seem to be yielding or producing the desired results or are not being effectively implemented. All political parties should be directed to earmark a certain percentage of their funds for such eventualities and the Election Commission of India should have a lien on those funds to recover the losses suffered as decided by the courts. Since the Opposition is planning to continue the agitation on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens issue nationwide, framing of rules assumes urgency. The act of the Muslim community in Uttar Pradesh in handing over a cheque for damages is a gesture to be emulated by all political parties (Page 1, “Railways want people to pay for property damage”, December 31).

V. Subramanian,

Chennai

This move, which is definitely an effective deterrent, should not be applied arbitrarily and selectively to target a particular set of people under the guise of indictment in arson and vandalism. The charged person who is otherwise innocent will be unnecessarily embroiled in long-drawn litigation. The flip side is a clear message that staging a protest is inviting trouble for oneself. Under such circumstances there is a probability that people holding democratic protests may adopt other clandestine ways and means to vent out their anger whose outcome may be more grave.

344,2020/01/01,Delhi’s best: 12 dishes to try this year,"Delhi’s food scene has gained momentum this past decade. Today, the city keeps an eye on international food trends, while also keenly teasing out India's various hyperlocal cuisines. International chefs fly in frequently, for pop-ups as well as opening new restaurants. All this while established domestic chefs expand their footprint, with newer offerings under their expertise. Food entrepreneurs are innovating constantly, while also helping Delhi slowly venture out of its safe and predictable palate. This round up lists 12 dishes — one for each month of the new year, if you wish — that you could try, or re-try, because the capital's food-scape would be bland without them.

Crab Butter Pepper Garlic, Swagath, Defence Colony

The crab, flown in every day from Kerala, must be eaten with the shell – use the crab cracker, get your fingers in there, and put the delightful morsels lubricated perfectly with butter, garlic and just the right amount of pepper. Scoop up the bits left at the end on your plate with a crisp naan. Heaven.

Malleshwaram 18th Cross Dosa, Carnatic Cafe, Greater Kailash II

The dosas here are thicker than the usual, but just as crispy. In the thickness lies the magic, the flavour and the punch. This one comes with a delicious podi (red-chilli-based powder) on the inside and a generous blob of white butter on top, which always bring a smile to one’s face.

Thai Chicken and Water Chestnut Salad, Mamagoto, Khan Market

Balance and consistency. The creamy chicken, the zing from the lemongrass, the spice from the cut red chillies and the crunch from water chestnut. Perfect. And in all the years I’ve been eating it, it’s remained exactly the same.

Amritsari Swaad Pizza, Paparizza, Hudson Lane

Two guys and a pizza place in North Delhi serving the best pizzas in town and that too until 3 a.m.! Put your judgement aside and eat the Amritsari one with a topping of Pindi chhole, spicy chillies and onions. Their pepperoni is also super. Wash it all down with a milkshake.

Chicken Liver Ice Cream, Tres, Lodhi Market

An ingenious take on a chicken liver pate. It’s cold and creamy but retains the lightness and flavour of the pate version. Divine. It comes paired with an equally delicious caramelized shallot tart tatin. I wish they sold the ice cream by the pint.

Peking Duck, The China Kitchen, Hyatt Regency, Bhikaji Cama Place

Slow roasted on order in a wood fired oven, the most succulent duck with the crispiest skin (served separately). One of the best in the world. Served with paper thin pancakes, great hoisin sauce and thinly sliced spring onions and cucumber. Insist on making your own rolls.

CKP Prawn Pulao, Spice Market, Saket

A recipe from the Mahrashtrian CKP community, the spice levels on this make the rice in the pulao stand erect and make your ears go red. The prawns are plump and sweet, and it’s so good that you cannot but help ask for more.

Butter Chicken, Have More, Pandara Road

Creamy and buttery, without being heavy. What makes it so special is that it’s spicy, sweet, and tangy, all at once. It’s sweeter than the usual ones, but the acidic hit balances it perfectly to make it work time and again.

Stuffed Kulchas, Indian Accent, The Lodhi, Lodhi Road

The unsung heroes at my favourite Indian restaurant in the world are their stuffed kulchas – apple wood smoked bacon, chilli hoisin duck, butter chicken, wild mushroom with truffle oil and the pumpkin-cheddar. Served with pomegranate raita, this is a meal in itself.

Jumbo Prawn Bao, Ping's, Lodhi Market

The softest bao, the biggest, most succulent and perfectly fried prawn, with mayo, and the perfect condiments, makes this Delhi's best, in a city where frozen prawns are usually tasteless. All you need with it is a chilled beer.

Hot Chocolate Fudge, Nirula’s, multiple locations

A childhood favourite that remains the ultimate pick-me-up. Vanilla ice cream and gooey fudge-y chocolate sauce, and oh, the nuts! Always order extra nuts, and if you like it sweeter and gooey-er, then extra fudge too. The double scoop over the triple, and never share.

Banoffee Pie, Big Chill Cafe and Cakery, Khan Market

The perfect amalgam of whipped cream, bananas, salted caramel and biscuit; it hits the right spot every single time.

346,2020/01/01,Pune Congress office vandalism: Bhor MLA denies any prior knowledge of incident,"The Pune city police have lodged an FIR in the vandalism of the Congress party office premises in Pune by alleged supporters of MLA Sangram Thopate even as State Congress chief and Minister Balasaheb Thorat on Wednesday refuted suggestions of discontent brewing within the party.

On Tuesday evening, an irate group of alleged supporters of party three-time MLA from Bhor Assembly constituency Sangram Thopate had vandalised the Congress Bhavan for not giving him a Cabinet berth despite his family being firm loyalists for decades.

Acting on a complaint by city Congress leader Sachin Adekar, the Shivajinagar police on Tuesday night registered the FIR against unidentified persons for rioting and vandalism under Sections 143, 144 (pertaining to unlawful assembly), 146, 147, 148 (rioting) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of ₹50) under the IPC.

“I spoke with Sangram Thopate on Tuesday night. The Congress party is one family and he will get his due. He said he had accepted the party high command’s decision… Since we are part of a government which is a three-party coalition, we [the Congress] got fewer ministerial berths,” said Mr. Thorat, stressing on the need for all party leaders to work in harmony under the circumstances.

On his part, Mr. Thopate condemned the vandalism and disclaimed any prior knowledge of the incident, clarifying that he was in Mumbai on Tuesday and that he returned to Bhor only on Wednesday morning.

“I, too, came to know of this after seeing on television channels. I am collecting information as to which part of Pune — urban or rural — did these alleged supporters come form and whether or not they were indeed Congress activists or just a ploy by a mischievous party,” said Mr. Thopate.

The Bhor MLA said he himself had accepted the decision of the senior leadership and called upon his supporters to maintain peace and not indulge in any unlawful activity.

Mr. Adekar, who filed the complaint, alleged that between 5:30 and 5:45 p.m. on Tuesday, several party activists from the Bhor-Velhe-Mulshi belt had stormed into the Congress Bhavan premises armed with rods, sticks and stones.

“The vandals raised slogans in support of Mr. Thopate and against MPCC chief Balasaheb Thorat. Though city general secretary Ramesh Iyer and a number of workers attempted to reason with the irate supporters of Mr. Thopate, they were in no mood to listen and went about smashing window panes, damaging doors, destroying office literature, the furniture and the television set. A number of them also indulged in stone-pelting which resulted in injuries to some of our workers,” reads the complaint.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pune-congress-office-vandalism-bhor-mla-denies-any-prior-knowledge-of-incident/article30452045.ece
347,2020/01/01,No malaria deaths recorded in past year,"For the first time in 10 years, Mumbai did not record a single malaria death in 2019.

The decade began with 145 malaria deaths in 2010, and civic officials went all out to curb its spread.

Malaria is transmitted by the female anopheles mosquito that breeds in dirty stagnant water. While the city recorded over 4,100 positive cases of malaria in 2019, experts said not recording any deaths is a big development. Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi lauded employees of the public health department, insecticide department and the ground staff that worked towards malaria control.

According to civic officials, the malaria control programme implemented aggressively since 2010 included vector (infected female anopheles mosquito) control activities, encouraging immediate treatment, public awareness, and so on.

Since 2010, officials said more than 65,954 breeding spots have been destroyed and articles across the city where breeding can take place, had been removed. In areas where patients tested positive for malaria, civic officials carried out combing operations to track breeding spots and destroy them. The BMC also issued notices and fined people who were negligent and allowed breeding to take place on their premises.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/q7poo9/article30446926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1bmmalariacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-malaria-deaths-recorded-in-past-year/article30446927.ece
348,2020/01/01,Hair transplant death: JJ Hospital panel finds negligence,"Nine months after Shrawan Choudhary, a 43-year-old businessman from Chandivali, died soon after a hair transplant procedure, a panel of doctors at the State-run JJ Hospital have found negligence at many levels. The Saki Naka police are contemplating whether a first information report (FIR) can be filed in the case.

“We have received the report and it has listed several instances where negligence was observed on part of the clinic. However, we are first seeking legal opinion regarding the report and will take action based on that,” senior police inspector Kishor Sawant said.

Assistant Commissioner of Police (Sakinaka division) Milind Khelte confirmed that the report has been received and said no FIR has been filed in the matter so far.

Choudhary died on March 9, two days after he underwent a hair transplant at dermatologist Dr. Vikas Halwai in his clinic at Chinchpokli. The doctor had grafted more than 3,000 hair follicles on Choudhary’s scalp.

After the procedure, Choudhary began complaining of pain and was taken to Global Hospital nearby where he was not admitted.

He was later admitted to a nursing home and discharged. At home, he complained of breathlessness and his face swelled up. The family took him to Hiranandani Hospital in Powai, where he died. While his viscera and organs were sent for analysis, the preliminary post-mortem report revealed that Chaudhary had symptoms of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, and had a multi-organ failure.

While the Saki Naka police had registered a case of accidental death, a committee of four doctors, including a plastic surgeon, was set up at JJ Hospital to look into medical negligence. JJ Hospital’s dean Dr. Pallavi Saple said the report was sent to the police on December 16.

Choudhary’s family members have been pushing for a speedy investigation. In a media briefing organised on December 11, Choudhary’s wife Seema and nephew Suresh said they do not want any delay in the investigations and filing of the FIR as it is already nine months since his death. Dr. Halwai refused to comment.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hair-transplant-death-jj-hospital-panel-finds-negligence/article30446921.ece
349,2020/01/01,Man threatens homemaker with morphed pictures,"The APMC police are on the lookout for a man who morphed pictures of a woman’s face on to a semi-nude photo and sent it to her on social media.

The 35-year-old homemaker from Turbhe on Monday received a WhatsApp message from an unidentified person who introduced himself as Akash. The man had used her photo from Facebook and morphed it on to a semi-nude photo and sent it to her. He also sent her the photo on Facebook Messenger, threatening to send them to her friends and relatives, and make the pictures viral on social media.

“The accused is unidentified and the complainant does not suspect anyone. She also claims that she has no enemies. We are verifying the details of the number and IP address of the accused with the help of cyber cell,” police inspector Basit Ali Sayyed said.

The complainant had received the messages between 1.30 and 2.30 p.m., after which she registered a complaint with the police under Sections 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication), 509 (insult the modesty of a woman) and 354 D (stalking) of the IPC and sections of the IT Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-threatens-homemaker-with-morphed-pictures/article30446903.ece
350,2020/01/01,Three held for murder of homeless man,"The police have arrested three people, including a woman, for the murder of a 38-year-old homeless man from Koparkhairane last week. The accused have been identified as Sunita Gupta, Saajan alias Mohammed Tujmal, and Prakash Daakva, all 40 years old.

On the morning of December 27, the body of Tipu Rafeeq Shaikh was found wrapped in a blanket on the verandah of a shop in the area. Locals identified Shaikh as he had been roaming in the area for 10 years.

According to the police, blood trails from the crime scene led them to the residence of Mr. Tujmal, who confessed to the crime and revealed the name of his accomplice, Mr. Daakve. Interrogation of the duo revealed that they invited Shaikh to Mr. Tujmal’s residence on the night of December 26, where they strangled him and slit his throat. They then wrapped his body in a blanket and dragged it outside the shop where he was found. “The duo also said they killed Shaikh at the behest of Ms. Gupta,” assistant police inspector Mahendra Wagh, Koparkhairane police station, said.

Shaikh used to live in a hutment beside Ms. Gupta’s residence, which was demolished by the encroachment department after the death of his parents, rendering him homeless. He usually took a bath and had lunch at Ms. Gupta’s house. “He had a habit of insulting her frequently for no reason. Fed up of listening to his taunts, Ms. Gupta decided to have Shaikh killed and tasked Mr. Tujmal and Mr. Daakve with it,” Mr. Wagh said.

351,2020/01/01,"‘By 2050, Mumbai and Chennai will be under water. What are we doing?’","Grundfos, the world’s largest pump manufacturer selling more than 16 million pump units annually, possibly knows better how to manage water at a time when most part of the world is facing a water crisis. The Hindu spoke to N.K. Ranganath, managing director, INDO Region, Grundfos Pumps India, on how serious the problem is in India and the way out.

How serious is the water crisis in India?

From an overall helicopter point of view, there is no crisis. Because our water precipitation in India is about 4000 billion cubic metres, of which half evaporates and gets lost. So we have 1,800 billion cubic metres for use. Our potential to use is approximately 1,200 billion cubic metres, so there is enough water for most purposes. But the moment you come down from a helicopter point of view to specific areas, then some States are in deep distress. It is a management problem. While 25% is managed well, 75% is not managed properly. That has created these issues. There are certain water stress areas. As per a norm, less than 1,700 cubic metres per person is considered water stress. And less than 1,100 cubic metres is water scarce. If you look at that, we are less than 1, 700. And probably we will be less than 1,100 cubic metres by 2030 or so if we do not do anything about it. Whenever you have a ratio like this, you have a numerator and a denominator. The numerator is the quantum of water that is neither increased nor reduced. On the other hand, precipitation has increased over the of years, but it comes at one time in heavy quantity and flows out. The denominator has increased phenomenally. In 1950, there was much more water, but less population. In 2020, our population has increased to over 1.3 billion. So the per capita has to come down. It is up to us to think through and manage these sources of water properly. If we can manage well even now, there will be enough water for all purposes.

How can we manage water?

India should have a 50 years’ road map irrespective of which government and political party remains in power. For now, you need a short-term approach because there is a crisis. So you need to reduce, reuse and recycle every day. Multiple use of water should be made compulsory. A timeline should be should be set to build infrastructure. All along the coasts you can have desalination plants. It is expensive to build, but cheap in terms of cubic metres of water. There has to be compliance. Discharge of raw sewage into lakes and rivers must stop. In case of effluents, where there is zero discharge and people are drilling bore holes and letting the effluents into the earth, it has to be handled firmly because it is going to destroy mother earth. Compliance is poor due to corruption. The ownership and accountability has to come from people. In the medium term, you have to restore water bodies and overflowing channels. All of them have been occupied and used as landfills. Destruction of wetlands must stop in urban and rural areas. You must plan check dams to store running water. Use technology to understand from where water is coming, where it is flowing and where it is staying. In the long term, canals should be built. Since India has to grow more food, there will be more demand of water for agriculture. Today, 85% of water is used by agriculture, while only 8% to 9% is used for drinking. So if you don’t focus on agriculture, improve cropping patterns and use micro drip irrigation, the country will be in problem.

How can this be handled?

It is a politically sensitive thing. So farmers are taking advantage of that. If you are writing off their loans, then takeover their assets just like it is done for corporate debtors. Farmers should be told what crop they should grow and how much water they can use. The government must promote drip irrigation. The farmers must know how much water they are using and they should be charged for water, maybe 50 paise for 1,000 litres, but one has to charge. Around 10% saving in water used for agriculture is huge. It is enough for the entire population of India. We need to act as citizens first and not wait for the government.

Which States in India are in the danger zone?

NITI Aayog has named 21 cities. By 2050, Mumbai and Chennai will be under water on account of global warming. What are we doing towards preventing that? 2050 is not far away in terms of building infrastructure.

What can be done about this?

I don’t see any thought by the government. But Mumbai and its Mayor should start thinking about an alternative. If you start building a new city now, it will take 30 years. Since it is bound to happen, people should be moved to higher planes. There is enough land available elsewhere. Since Jakarta is sinking, they are looking at moving out. One must move the capital first. When the government moves and all the government buildings move, then people will move.

Which countries have excelled in water management?

Portugal has done an amazing job. Twenty years ago, their rivers were polluted and one could not drink water from the tap as sewage was going into it. Today, they have the cleanest water, cleanest river. Water was free in the past. Now everybody pays for it. Since they are self-sufficient in terms of money, they keep these plants going and have built several waste water treatment plants and are doing well. Portugal is a small nation, but we can learn from them. Most developed countries have no problem. In Philippines, parts of Manila have done well.

How can floods caused by extended and excessive monsoons be managed?

Today we are in the digital age. There is enough data to predict what will happen. So when you know that this is going to happen you have almost a year to the next rainy season. What are we doing in that direction? It is again a question of management. Starting to act at the time of the rains has to stop. We should act when there is no rain, plan in advance.

What do you think about the Prime Minister’s ₹3.5 lakh crore investment to provide water to 50% of homes?

The intention is good. He has done that for Swachh Bharat. It is tough. But if they achieve 50% of the target it would be a great achievement. My only worry is that when you put a tap it should find the water. Also what to do with waste water requires holistic thinking. It should be handed to the right people than to the lowest bidders.

What is the way forward?

Approach the issue of water in a long term and holistic manner. There has to be one owner of water, one ministry. The local authorities must start charging for water, which is most important. You have to start looking at compliance and what the effluents are. The dirtier the water, the more the penalty. It needs a huge political will.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gedlrb/article30446870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMRanganath,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/by-2050-mumbai-and-chennai-will-be-under-water-what-are-we-doing/article30446871.ece
352,2020/01/01,City ranks 8th in cleanliness chart,"In the first two quarters of Swachh Survekshan (SS) League 2020, Mumbai jumped from the 13th rank in the first quarter to the eighth rank in the second. Similarly, Navi Mumbai improved its tally from the eighth rank to the third rank in the two respective quarters. The results were announced in a press conference in the national Capital on Tuesday.

In the annual Swachh Survekshan for 2019, Mumbai had ranked 49th while Navi Mumbai ranked seventh.

‘Crucial ranking’

The SS League 2020 has been conducted in three quarters: April to June, July to September and October to December 2019 and has 2,000 marks for each quarter. The entries are evaluated on the basis of a monthly updation of the ‘Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) — Urban’ by cities, along with citizens’ validation on the 12 service-level progress indicators. The league has been divided into categories based on the participating cities’ population: those with a population of more than 10 lakh, those with a population between one lakh and 10 lakh, and so on.

“The performance of cities in SS League 2020 is crucial to their ranking in Swachh Survekshan 2020 due to the 25% weightage of the quarterly assessments to be included in the annual survey from January 4 till January 31, 2020,” said a Central government press release.

In the over-10 lakh city category, Mumbai had ranked 13th in the first quarter and improved significantly in the second quarter. In the annual results for 2019, Mumbai had ranked 49th, while in 2018, it was in the 18th position. Navi Mumbai improved its position to third in the second quarter.

In last year’s annual Survekshan, Navi Mumbai was at the seventh spot, from the ninth in 2018.

In the one lakh-10 lakh population category, in Quarter 1, four cities from Maharashtra made it to the top 20 where Kolhapur ranked fifth, Mira-Bhayandar ranked 10th, Solapur ranked 11th and Panvel ranked 12th. In Quarter 2, Kolhapur slipped to number 14, Mira-Bhayandar was stable at rank 10, Solapur did not feature in the top 20 while Panvel slipped to No. 16. In last year’s annual results, Panvel had ranked 86th.

Hardeep Singh Puri, Minister of State for Housing and Urban Affairs, announced the results of the Swachh Survekshan League 2020 in Delhi on Monday. The league was introduced with the aim of sustaining the cities’ performance as well as continuously observing their service-level record on cleanliness.

Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner and nodal officer-in-charge of SBM in BMC, said, “This year, we have laid a lot of stress on segregation of waste at source, composting of wet waste and recycling of dry waste. Maharashtra has a plastic ban in place, which was one of the criteria for the Survekshan this year and gave us an advantage. However, the final ranking will include citizens’ feedback, observation by a team from Delhi and several things. We are hoping our final rank will be even better.”

The quarterly results will be proportionately added to the final results. The corporation wants to showcase Mumbai’s beach cleaning initiative and its new policy to give a rebate to housing societies who carry out segregation, in the final Survekshan.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dx0lsi/article30446866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1bmswachhrevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/city-ranks-8th-in-cleanliness-chart/article30446867.ece
353,2020/01/01,Midday meal scheme grain racket busted in Vikhroli,"The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has busted a racket where rice grain meant to be supplied to government schools under the midday meal scheme was being sold to grocers instead.

According to Crime Branch sources, Unit VII officers received a tip-off about the racket on Monday evening. A team raided Ambika Dhanya Bhandaar in Vikhroli and seized 1,187.5 kg of rice kept in 25 gunny sacks.

Shop owner Chintan Gusai (24), when questioned about the source of the rice, said he had bought it from Shreya Industrial Products Cooperative Trust in Hanuman Nagar in Vikhroli a few days ago.

“Acting on this information, we went to the office of the Trust and confirmed that it gets rice at subsidised rates from the government to supply to State-run schools for use in midday meals. However, the Trust was selling the rice at market rate and making huge profits from the sales,” a Crime Branch officer said.

The officer said while the Trust sold the rice to Mr. Gusai last week for the first time, it is suspected to have been running the racket for a longer period.

The Crime Branch handed over Mr. Gusai, Trust manager Chandrakant Panaskar and trustee Sangeeta Panaskar to the Parksite police station, along with the seized rice.

“We are examining the records of the Trust. We are also making inquiries with the schools that the Trust was supplying the rice to so that we can get a better sense of how long the racket has been running, and how much rice the Trust has sold in the black market. We are also finding out how many other grocers the Trust has sold the rice to, and whether there is anyone else involved in the racket,” an officer with the Vikhroli police said.

The trio has been booked for cheating under the Indian Penal Code and is being questioned. The police said no arrests have been made yet as inquiries remain to be completed.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/65bhps/article30446852.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1bmvideograb,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/midday-meal-scheme-grain-racket-busted-in-vikhroli/article30446853.ece
354,2020/01/01,"Donation box with ₹40,000 stolen from temple in Kalyan","The Kongaon police have initiated inquiries into a burglary at a temple in Kalyan, where unidentified people made away with the temple’s donation box containing ₹40,000.

According to the police, the crime was committed between Monday night and Tuesday morning at a Ram temple in Kongaon.

“The burglary was discovered around 6 a.m., when the priest reached the temple to open it and found the lock broken open. He entered the temple and saw that the donation box was missing and so was the digital video recorder (DVR) of the CCTV camera system,” an officer with the Kongaon police said.

The officer said prima facie, the involvement of three to four people is suspected in the offence, as the box is not light enough for just one person to carry and still make a quick getaway.

‘Single suspect’

“A CCTV camera mounted a short distance away from the temple has captured a single suspect, who seems to be in his late teens or early 20s, running away from the temple in the early hours of the day. We are working on the assumption that the accused split up after committing the burglary, and while this suspect fled in one direction, at least two others headed in another direction with the box,” he said.

The priest has told the police that the donation box was securely locked and the police suspect that the burglars made away with it as they were unable to open it quickly. “We are checking on the movements of known offenders with a history of burglary and seeking help from local informants. We have also obtained footage from several other cameras around the temple and are scanning it for clues,” the officer said.

The police have for the moment registered a case of burglary against unknown persons under the Indian Penal Code and are conducting further investigations.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/donation-box-with-40000-stolen-from-temple-in-kalyan/article30446824.ece
355,2020/01/01,Two Metro lines on track to begin operations in 2020,"Mumbaikars will bear witness to two Metro lines taking shape in 2020.

Officials of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) are racing against time to ensure that the two lines, Metro 2A and 7, begin operations by the end of 2020. September will mark the completion of the tunnelling of Metro 3, the city’s only underground Metro.

At present, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) has completed tunnelling 40 km of a total of 55 km with 24 breakthroughs on Metro 3.

According to MMRDA officials, the trials for Metro 2A and Metro 7 are likely to be conducted in September 2020. A senior MMRDA official said, “Now, nearly 80% of the civil work has been completed and we have started work on the systems and station development. We are aiming to open both lines by the end of 2020.”

The 18.6-km-long Metro 2A will connect Dahisar (West) to DN Nagar and is being built on the Link Road, while the 16.5-km-long Metro 7 is being built on Western Express Highway between Dahisar (East) and Andheri (East).

Significant year

The new year will have other significant developments with the MMRCL planning to award tenders of the rehabilitation buildings at Kalbadevi and Girgaum in January and May respectively. The third tranche of the loan from the Japanese International Cooperation Agency will be received in March.

While the work on all three Metro corridors has been progressing well, uncertainty prevails over the fate of Metro 3 car shed. The committee set up in December has sought an extension and will be exploring options for an alternative site.

A member of the committee, on condition of anonymity, said they had visited five sites, including the present site at Aarey Milk Colony. The site for the car shed has to be identified soon as the MMRCL is expecting the first batch of rolling stock for Metro 3 to arrive by December 2020.

MMRDA too has its own share of woes as it has not yet secured the plot in Dahisar to build a car shed for Metro 7. It plans to use the car shed being developed for Metro 2A at Malvani for both corridors initially. This will mean that both lines will be opened at the same time.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/yeh031/article30446777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1bmmetrocol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-metro-lines-on-track-to-begin-operations-in-2020/article30446778.ece
356,2020/01/01,Ghatkopar headless body: legs of victim found in Vidyavihar,"The police on Tuesday recovered the legs of the woman whose dismembered, headless body was found in Ghatkopar on Monday.

The torso was found across the street from a State Transport workshop on Kirol Road, wrapped in a bedsheet, senior police inspector Kusum Waghmare said, “The legs were found near the Central Railway’s car shed in Vidyavihar. We have sent them to Rajawadi Hospital to confirm if they belong to the same victim.”

Meanwhile, the Ghatkopar police registered a case of murder against unknown persons under the Indian Penal Code based on the post-mortem reports sent by Rajawadi Hospital. “The reports state that it took at least three attempts for the murderer to successfully chop the head off the torso,” Ms. Waghmare said.

Doctors have also told the police that the victim seems to be in her late 20s. The police have preserved the fingernails to help with DNA identification at a later stage. Residents of Shastri Nagar Cooperative Housing Society, which is close to where the torso was found, said some of them saw it during their morning walk.

“Initially, we thought that it was some garbage which was dumped by somebody staying in the area. It was only when we saw bloodstains on the bedsheet that we decided to call the police,” a resident, who did not wish to be named, said.

The police are still trying to find out whether the legs were dumped in Vidyavihar on Tuesday or had been discarded there the previous day. Inquiries are under way with local residents and footage from several CCTV cameras is also being scanned. “We have sought information from all police stations in the city about a woman in her 20s going missing over the last few days,” Ms. Waghmare said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qb36w7/article30446733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31bmGhatkopar-murder,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ghatkopar-headless-body-legs-of-victim-found-in-vidyavihar/article30446734.ece
357,2020/01/01,City experiences warmest December in past decade,"Mumbai recorded its coldest temperature this season at 16.4 degrees Celsius on Tuesday. However, in the last decade, the lowest minimum temperature in December has always been under 15 degrees Celsius, making December 2019 much warmer than the rest.

On December 14, Mumbai recorded a minimum temperature of 18 degrees Celsius. With existing weather conditions, it appeared that this would be the lowest the mercury would drop. However, on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, the Santacruz observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 16.4 degrees Celsius (one degree below normal), while the Colaba observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 19 degrees Celsius.

Meanwhile, the maximum temperature also dipped to 28.8 degrees Celsius (three degrees below normal), making Tuesday the coldest day of the month and the season.

According to data shared by India Meteorological Department on Twitter, the Borivali (East) weather station recorded a minimum temperature below 15 degrees Celsius, but the figure from the Santacruz observatory is considered to be representative of the entire city.

In the past decade, the lowest minimum temperature has fallen below 15 degrees Celsius every single year, thus making 2019 the only year when it the temperatures did not plummet drastically. In that sense, this month is the warmest of the decade. However, the maximum temperature has been more or less normal, and not unusually warm. The all-time lowest minimum temperature is 10.6 degrees Celsius, which was recorded on December 20, 1949.

Mahesh Palawat, vice president (meteorology) at private weather forecaster Skymet Weather, tweeted, “Mumbai witnessed fall of around four degrees in minimums, reason is cold winds from North East. We expect further drop during next two to three days, it may come down to 14 degrees. Vidarbha and Marathwada are all set to get good rains.”

358,2020/01/01,Wake up to morning ragas this Sunday,"Following the success of its initiative last year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is again planning to host local talent in the field of classical music at open spaces in the city on the first Sunday of January.

The performances will be free of cost and will be held across 20 venues.

Last year, the BMC had decided to open up amphitheatres in the city’s municipal gardens for local artistes. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Mumbai Arts, Music and Culture Commission. The newly formed commission had identified several gardens with amphitheatres that were rarely used for public performances. To encourage art, music and dance, the BMC organised concerts at 16 locations in the city. They included solo performances on the tabla, sitar, sarangi, sarod, santoor and flute.

This year, the BMC will be hosting 120 artistes who will be performing across 20 open spaces in the city under the Mumbai Green Raga initiative.

The two-hour-long performances, which will be centred around morning ragas, will start at 7 a.m. at all venues. The performances will be open to all.

The venues include Kamala Nehru Park (Malabar Hill), Tata Garden (Breach Candy), Patwardhan Park (Bandra), Kishore Kumar Baug (Juhu), Shilpagram (Jogeshwari), Hiranandani Garden (Powai), and Diamond Garden (Chembur).

The event has been organised in association with Tender Roots Academy of Performing Arts.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wake-up-to-morning-ragas-this-sunday/article30446677.ece

360,2020/01/01,BS-VI TVS Apache RTR 200 4V review: Leaning into the curves,"If there was one TVS Apache RTR model that offered a great mix of performance, handling, and practicality, it’s the 200. It’s one of the most successful Apaches to date and it isn’t surprising that TVS is putting all its might behind the RTR 200 4V as it steps into the BS-VI era — one in which performance could take a hit in the interest of cleaner emissions. But is it still as much fun to ride as the outgoing BS-IV model?

How does it look?

When you stand in front of the 2020 RTR 200 4V and look at that new LED headlamp, those plastic extensions that surround it appear as a pair of fangs. It does take a while for the new design to sink in, and let’s just say that it isn’t as easy on the eye as the previous bike’s design. That said, this shape suits the black paint job on the test bike, and I honestly feel that the unusual design will appeal to many — once the initial shock wears off that is. At least, that was the case with me.

Move past this and the rest of the motorcycle is the same, save for the new side panel. A set of contrasting red graphics runs across the length of the RTR 200, mainly accentuating the lines on the fuel tank and panels. Even though these changes are subtle, the RTR 200 looks fresh and the swirl-style, alloy-wheel design looks great.

While it made its début in the last 200’s update in October 2019, this is the first time we’re experiencing TVS’ ‘Smart Xonnect’ technology. This Bluetooth-pairable instrument cluster displays a plethora of information including lap times, top speed, incoming caller name and a lot more. A dedicated phone app also allows riders to track their ride telemetry and maximum lean angle achieved. However, the latter is recorded using the phone’s gyro sensors and requires the device to be rigidly mounted onto the bike in a vertical position.

How is its new BS-VI engine?

The RTR’s 197.75cc, oil-cooled motor has always packed a punch despite its size, and that mainly has to do with an incredible sense of urgency. It loved to be revved, and thankfully, this nature continues in the BS-VI engine as well. TVS has employed a new, lightweight piston that further contributes to the bike’s rev-happy nature; and we are happy to note that the RTR 200 hasn’t lost its character while conforming to the new emission norms.

Those with a keen eye on the spec sheet will notice that though the power figure remains unchanged, the new motor produces slightly less torque. However, in the real world, there’s no perceivable drop in performance. The RTR 200 still feels as quick as ever and the accompanying throaty exhaust note adds to the sense of speed. This motor is not as refined as the BS-VI engine on the RTR 160, but the vibrations aren’t strong enough to put you off. I’d say it’s more in tune with the nature of the motorcycle.

TVS has fitted its Glide Through Technology (GTT), as seen in the BS-VI 2020 RTR 160 4V. Given that this motorcycle will spend most of its time battling city traffic, this is a welcome feature. GTT uses the fuel-injection system to inject a small amount of fuel that allows the bike to smoothly crawl forward through congested roads without the need for throttle inputs — something along the lines of the creep function in a car with auto transmission.

How does it handle?

But, in all honesty, the RTR 200 has always been in its element around a set of corners, away from the confines of a city, and the new BS-VI version doesn’t disappoint in this regard either.

The KYB fork at the front and Showa monoshock at the rear are carried forward from the BS-IV model and offer a good mix of ride and handling. Along with the feedback-rich chassis, the RTR 200 V4 is a treat to chuck around corners. For instance, while riding around the TVS test track’s extra-long, right-hander parabola, the RTR stuck to an intended line with pinpoint accuracy. The new, grippy TVS Eurogrip radial tyre at the rear is also part of the reason why the RTR 200 feels so confident, especially while powering out of corners. It truly goes to show that a well-engineered, small-capacity machine can turn out to be quite the entertainer.

Should I buy one?

The Apache RTR 200 4V has always been the most well-rounded motorcycle in the 200cc segment. With the BS-VI update, the price has gone up by ₹10,000, and that’s justified, considering the long list of features it offers as standard, including a slipper clutch. And if that’s not enough, the RTR’s ability to keep one engaged truly makes it an enjoyable proposition.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/p83nsa/article30450584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1MP-TVS-Apache-6,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/leaning-into-the-curves/article30450585.ece
361,2020/01/01,New SUVs for India in 2020,"There is a lot in store for the SUV market in 2020.

Coming: End 2020

Price: From ₹6.5 lakh

MG Maxus D90

The D90 SUV will be taking on the Fortuner and the Endeavour by the horns.

It gets an arrowhead-like nose and its lines flow nicely around the wide haunches. It also gets some butch cladding, big wheels and even roof rails to complete that SUV look. The interiors get a new digital instrument panel and funky new-age dash. Under the hood, the model will be powered by a 1.5 TSI petrol engine.

Coming: Mid-2020

Price: From ₹20 lakh

Mahindra Thar

The next-gen Thar will be underpinned by a new ladder-frame chassis and grow in size.

Powering the new Thar will be a 140hp, 2.2-litre diesel that’s shared with the new Scorpio and paired with a 6-speed manual as standard. As before, four-wheel drive will be offered, with a two-wheel-drive automatic also likely.

Coming: Early 2020

Price: From ₹11 lakh

Tata Gravitas

Based on the Harrier, the Gravitas will be around 62mm longer and it will come with an additional row of seats. Its wheelbase will, however, remain unchanged. While its styling will be similar to the Harrier’s, the rear will be revised to accommodate the third row. Under the hood will sit a BS-VI-compliant 170hp, 2.0-litre diesel engine mated to either a 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic.

362,2020/01/01,These are the five must-see travel destinations of 2020,"It is time to update your bucketlist of travel destinations, except make it a point to explore the offbeat trail this year — whether it is flyboarding, trotting around a medieval town, or eating whale blubber while scoping a glacier. Make it your Mission: 2020

Mauritius

Ever tried befriending a bottlenose dolphin?

In Mauritius, you can do this, and also try your hand at fun water sports: sea kart, kite surf or flyboard like Hrithik Roshan in Bang Bang!. This sunny island, in the Indian Ocean, also owns a submarine that can take you 35 metres under water, and give a tour of shipwreck, corals and its rich marine life.

“The Mauritian coast is (approx) 330 kilometres long with sandy beaches everywhere. The lagoons have crystal-clear water, and it is ideal for swimming and snorkelling,” says Arvind Bundhun, director, Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority.

Despite its small size, Mauritius packs in quite a punch in terms of activities and sight seeing. Le Caudan Waterfront is where all the action is, if you want to enjoy a night out, grab a few drinks, try your luck at the casino, shop or just watch a movie. La Valle des Couleurs Reserve has volcanic ashes and a section of it has Planet Earth in 23 different colours.

While Port Louis is the capital and its economic centre, there are other towns and villages like Grand Bay and Flic en Flac that demand attention. Not to forget, Mauritius is a hot favourite among golfers (as many as 60,000 of the annual one million visitors are golfers).

“The island offers 18-hole courses (10) and 9-hole courses (three). They are set in natural environments, and have been designed for championships by renowned golfers such as Peter Matkovich, Peter Alliss, Rodney Wright,” Arvind adds.

Quite a few Bollywood movies have been shot here, and, of late, Mauritius has become a destination wedding spot too. Considering its cheap exchange rate (1 Mauritian Rupee = 2 INR approximately) Mauritius is also a pocket-friendly destination.

Montenegro

The Dark Side of the Sun, an American-Yugoslavian film from 1988 that you have likely not heard of, is what we have to thank for having introduced two beautiful things to the world in a single frame — a then little-known actor by name Brad Pitt and Montenegro.

Only a country of its own since 2006, interest in Montenegro tourism has risen favourably over the last couple of years. Ashish Dhruva, vice president, ClearTrip, says that the country received over 9.5 lakh tourists in 2018.

“In the first three months of 2019, there was a 38% year-on-year jump in the number of tourists visiting Montenegro,” he adds. Besides the picturesque landscape, the Montenegrin weather is a major factor in attracting visitors. The best time to visit the country is between May and September, he notes.

The coast — Montenegro’s 293-kilometre-long coastline is populated by 120 beaches that run for 73 kilometres — is the best place to be during the summer, as temperatures prevail around the warm 30 degrees Celsius mark.

While the capital city is Podgorica, it is Kotor that attracts most tourists.

A UNESCO world heritage site, Kotor is a medieval town, and is credited for having played an important role in spreading the Mediterranean culture across the Balkans. The Romanesque churches and the many fortified structures within the old city walls are among the sights to take in here.

“Montenegro also has well-marked walking and cycling routes. Tourists can take easy routes around the lakes in Biogradska Gora and Durmitor national parks. Kayaking around the Bay of Kotor and on Lake Skadar (the largest lake in Southern Europe) is an option for adventure sport lovers. Cross-country skiing [during the winter months] is another adrenaline rush option,” Ashish says.

For the spiritually inclined, there is also the Ostrog Monastery, which Ashish describes as an “unusual architectural wonder” — the monastery rests against the Ostroška Greda (a high rock), as if it was carved out of it.

While the quaintness on offer would make it seem that Montenegro is the perfect family summer destination, Ashish defers. It is as much “a destination for the millennial solo traveller to find peace and even go wild”, he says.

“A popular destination for the youngsters is in the middle of Montenegro’s coastline — the town of Budva. It has nearly 35 beaches and significant cultural establishments. Budva is also known for its vibrant nightlife,” Ashish adds.

Travelling options are limited at the moment — if travelling from Delhi, stop-overs at Rome or at Doha and Vienna are required before heading to Podgorica. However, Irish budget airliner Ryanair will be launching flights in the summer to the Montenegrin capital from Poland’s Krakow and Poznan. British Airways too has announced plans to start flights from Heathrow to Podgorica, which may come in handy for those on a multi-country tour of Europe.

Poland

If dark tourism is what you are kicked about in the New Year, then Poland should be on your list.

The country is home to the Auschwitz concentration camp, Museum of the Second World War (Gdansk) and the Mausoleum of Struggle and Martyrdom (Warsaw) — each a reminder of the pain, terror and suffering inflicted upon people by Nazi Germany.

But the country also has a vibrant culture, food and entertainment scene. Over the last few years, the city of Kraków has emerged as a popular destination, especially among youngsters, what with its night life and shot bars. While Warsaw, Wrocław and Gdańsk are the most well-known cities, there are other spectacular spots too.

Like the resort town of Zakopane, which lies in the foothills of the imposing Tatra mountains, and Wieliczka, near Kraków, which is famous for its salt mine lit by grand chandeliers, or Poznań — better known for the rows of pastel-hued houses in the Old Town. Poland is also comparatively cheaper than most other European cities. So, go ahead and splurge on another round of krupnik (local liqueur).

Norway

It may not be the most affordable destination, but the charming fjords of Norway will make you believe every penny spent is worth it.

Though Oslo may be the most visited as the capital city, this country has a mind-boggling selection that will make you want to extend your leave. Let us start with Tromsø, which lies above the Arctic Circle — meaning it is a natural winter wonderland, and the perfect base to explore the Northern Lights. This is also where you get to experience the Polar night phenomenon, when the sun remains below the horizon, and the sky is a beautiful ink-blue for the most part.

Another place we are obsessing over is the Lofoten Islands. Henningsvær, one of the fishing villages here, has a football field that is cradled by the sea on one side and rugged cliffs on the other — a surreal landscape. Stay in a charming red rorbu (traditional fishermen’s cabin) — they sit on the waterfront, and offer sweeping views of the sea as well as the snow-covered mountains. In addition, activities like hiking, whale watching, kayaking, Arctic fishing and glamping make it an exotic destination.

Greenland

Remember when Donald Trump, the US President, fantasised, or ‘joked’ about his fantasy of, purchasing Greenland?

Thanks in part to him, the world’s largest island is emerging as an offbeat tourist destination. The easiest way to reach is through flights, but the options are limited.

“There are only two [international] airports — Narsarsuaq [in the south] and Kangerlussuaq [in the west]. Travellers can fly into Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, either from Canada or Iceland during summer. Flights are also available from Copenhagen (Denmark), Keflavík and Reykjavík (Iceland) or Iqaluit (Canada),” says Rajeev Kale, President and Country Head (Holidays, MICE, Visas), Thomas Cook India, adding, “Many travellers choose to visit Greenland via cruises as well. Luxury ships offer 10-24 nights stay, including stops in Iceland or Svalbard [in Norway].”

A multiple-entry visa from the Danish Embassy is needed for the travel. June through September (summer) is the best time of the year to visit Greenland, which is home to the iconic Ilulissat Kangerlua (Icefjord) — a UNESCO world heritage site.

“There is also the Lyberth Charter (a cottage built in 1859), the Qaqortoq museum (built in 1804) and a tele museum, which is located in a former radio station that was built in 1925,” Rajeev says, adding that his firm offers three or four day package trips that can cost between €1,600 to €1,900 per person.

Helicopters, small aeroplanes and ferries are the most feasible options for travel within Greenland. “There are multiple hotels, hostels and bed-and-breakfast guesthouses for the solo traveller. Camping is an option, but travellers who prefer luxury accommodations can explore staying in an igloo or an eco-lodge overlooking the Eqip Sermia glacier,” Rajeev notes. The local cuisine borders on the exotic — whale meat, seal and eider duck are the staples alongside dried cod. “The most popular [among Greenlanders] is Narwhal blubber (whale fat),” he adds.",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/lxauza/article30451075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02mpMontenegro-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/these-are-the-five-must-see-travel-destinations-of-2020/article30451083.ece
363,2020/01/01,How The Explorers app digitises your travel narrative,"For some people, travelling means unplugging.

But it is 2020, and the technology industry has no choice but to cater to smartphone-toting adventurers. While a groundswell of social media apps such as Instagram, Twitter and, in some cases, Reddit, come handy, there still is a terabyte-sized vacuum in the digital travel space — one which The Explorers, the world’s first inventory app with High Definition (4K) content, is hoping to fill.

Trend check Know the lingo: Gone are the days of carrying a thick little book full of rudimentary phrases in a foreign language. Now, travellers can rely on up-to-date language translation apps such as iTranslate and Google Translate, which continue to grow their linguistic repertoire. The advantages of language apps include up-to-date dialects. But do not expect colloquial terms to pop out of your mouth while flirting with the Sicilian barman, who is serving you fine amaretto.

Gone are the days of carrying a thick little book full of rudimentary phrases in a foreign language. Now, travellers can rely on up-to-date language translation apps such as iTranslate and Google Translate, which continue to grow their linguistic repertoire. The advantages of language apps include up-to-date dialects. But do not expect colloquial terms to pop out of your mouth while flirting with the Sicilian barman, who is serving you fine amaretto. Clean up the planet: If 2019 was the year of developing a ‘green mind’, 2020 will be the year of mediating that change through lifestyle apps. Travellers should be leaning into carbon neutral initiatives by tour companies on booking apps. Already in the market are carbon neutral air safaris, zero-waste Airbnbs and apps like Green Globe, which help you find eco-friendly hotels, and Environmental Working Group’s ‘Healthy Living’ app which details how ‘clean’ and conflict-free a given food item or product in a given country is.

The app has a strong presence in the Americas and Europe, but is not as popular in India, though it is not even a year old. The Explorers is the result of the melding of two travel-hungry minds — of Olivier Chiabodo and Jean-Pierre Morel, its founders — who wanted a platform to exclusively document the world’s geographical gems.

“We have a diverse team of developers, scientists, content moderators and videographers to make sure the content is geo-tagged, original, and meets our visual standards,” Olivier explained, when he spoke at the App Store Best of 2019 event in New York City on December 2. The Explorers team was awarded Apple TV App Of The Year. “The app is available in Hindi too, but we could look into regional languages if we see more activity from the community in India,” he noted.

There is a disclaimer. The Explorers is not for the pouty Instagrammer sporting a peace symbol at Machu Picchu; it is for hardcore travellers. Available on iOS and Android devices, the app is best utilised and enjoyed after your travel than during it. Whatever footage or photography one has acquired, it can be edited and uploaded to the app in the form of a teaser reel or a longer story-telling format. And if one has filmed in 4K or 8K resolution, the result is best viewed on a larger screen.

The app has multiple tabs — the one titled ‘The Explorers’ feature mini-documentaries, news snippets and facts for quick reading. There is also premium content in this section such as ‘The Explorers+ Earth Stories’ — which narrate unconventional tales such as sea unicorns and semi-wild horses on the Marquesas Islands.

As a user, though, you would be sharing content to the ‘Community’ section, which seems to be more a serious social network for adventurers, documentary filmmakers, photographers and conservationists. The Explorers also recently launched the Academy — a contest in which the app’s users contribute to the Earth’s inventory, with the winner going on a five-day expedition with their team to Peru.

364,2020/01/01,"Kiran Bedi differs with Puducherry CM, says SEC’s appointment should be after due process","Shortly after Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy’s stated that former bureaucrat T. M Balakrishnan would continue as State Election Commissioner (SEC), Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Wednesday said the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has directed the Chief Secretary to appoint the SEC “after due process,” to oversee the local body elections.

Ms. Bedi, in a WhatsApp message to reporters, said “The Government of India has directed the Chief Secretary to appoint a State Election Commissioner only after a due process to oversee conducting of the local body elections as against a person nominated by the Chief Minister without a due process and against the rules.” The MHA has directed the Chief Secretary to “select an officer by an open selection and not nomination as done by the Chief Minister.”

On the Chief Minister’s remark that the direction from the Lt Governor should be dumped to the dustbin, Ms Bedi said “the Chief Minister appears to be having repeated problems with his choice of words.”

365,2020/01/01,"There is no rethinking State Election Commissioner appointment, Puducherry CM says","Ruling out any rethinking over the appointment of former bureaucrat T. M Balakrishnan as State Election Commissioner (SEC) in the wake of Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) directing the government to select the SEC in a “transparent” manner, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Wednesday said the MHA, in its order, has not cancelled the appointment. Hence Mr. Balakrishnan would oversee the upcoming local body polls.

“The incumbent SEC was appointed after the Speaker gave the right to the elected government to appoint the poll officer. MHA has not cancelled the appointment. Moreover, the MHA or Lieutenant Governor have no power to remove an SEC,” he said addressing a press conference.

In response to the objections raised by Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi over the appointment of the SEC, the MHA last month had directed the government to “select the State Election Commissioner through a transparent, competitive and fair process where the applications are invited through an all India advertisement and is made through a Selection Committee headed by Chief Secretary, for the timely completion of election process.”

The MHA had also vested the power to finalise the terms and reference of the Selection Committee with the Lieutenant Governor.

Asked about the fate of the Lieutenant Governor’s recent order directing the Chief Secretary to finalise the Selection Committee, Mr. Narayanasamy said “the order can be put to dustbin. Mr. Balakrishnan has already started the process to conduct the civic body polls. He will continue with his work.”

The Chief Minister said the government will go to court challenging the MHA order directing the government to transfer money to beneficiaries accounts instead of distributing free rice. The rules framed by the Assembly on the free rice scheme stipulated the distribution of free rice instead of cash. “We will follow the rules and challenge the MHA direction on free rice in the Court,” he added.

The government will launch a new health insurance scheme to cover card holders not benefited under the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat Scheme, he said. The scheme will be implemented from the next financial year. A sum of ₹ 18 crore would be needed to cover around 2. 60 lakh ration card holders, he said.

The Chief Minister also took exception to derogatory remarks made by ‘orator’ Nellai Kannan against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah recently.

“It is not appropriate to make personal remarks against anyone. One can be critical about the policies and programmes,” the Chief Minister said in response to a related query at a press conference.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/sigvqa/article30451199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01JANTH-PONDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/there-is-no-rethinking-state-election-commissioner-appointment-puducherry-cm-says/article30451200.ece

In an article released here on Tuesday, Mr.Vijayan said that the functioning of LKS during the past two years was quite significant as it helped the transfer of resources and ideas, making NRKs the partners of development in the State.

The Left Democratic Front considers LKS as an organisation for delivering what it had claimed during its inception. The LKS secretariat as well as seven standing committees too have been constituted. The government has also implemented its proposals in a time-bound manner. This was proof of the government’s commitment to NRKs and also LKS, he said.

Formation of the Overseas Keralites Investment and Holding Limited has helped to channelise the NRK returns in their as well as the benefit of the State. The sabha is being developed as a platform for addressing all issues faced by NRKs and this has come as a great relief to those residing overseas.

Steep hike airfares is one the major issues being faced by those living in the Gulf countries. Those having NRK identity cards are getting 7% fare concession on Oman Airlines. The sabha could wrest an assurance from the Union Aivation Ministry to have more flights in the Gulf sector. Following the talks with the Sharjha ruler, the government could secure the release of 149 Keralite prisoners too.

The government has also initiated a number of schemes for effectively using the NRK returns for the development of the State, he said and lauded the role played by the NRKs in the rescue and relief operations during the flood.EOM/NJN",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/lks-an-initiative-for-welfare-development-says-cm/article30447291.ece
369,2020/01/01,Corporation all set to enforce plastic ban,"For the workers of the city Corporation’s health wing, it is a familiar process all over again, as they gear up for the Statewide ban on single-use plastic, which will become effective from New Year day. More than two years ago, the civic body had banned the use of plastic carry bags, after which it had carried out campaigns across shops and markets in the city, to promote the use of alternatives like cloth and paper bags.

Although some change is visible, especially in the use of cloth bags in some supermarkets and shops, plastic carry bags are still widespread. Quite a few of the shop owners have continued to use them after the initial phase of frequent raids had stopped.

“In 2017, when the Corporation first imposed the ban, we did not have the capacity to produce alternatives on our own. So, we depended on such manufacturers, bringing them together in fairs for alternative packing materials and supplying them to the shops. This time, the supply of cloth bags come from the five cloth bag-making units, which the Corporation opened recently. In the past one month, around 1.5 lakh cloth bags have been sold. But, shopkeepers have still not turned up in expected numbers to collect these bags, as of now,” says a health official of the Corporation.

Subsidised rates

Institutions and individuals in need of cloth bags can contact the civic body for buying the same at subsidised rates. Last week, as part of the campaign against using plastic carry bags, the Corporation had distributed cloth bags and pamphlets to traders in the city’s markets. But many shopkeepers have still not warmed up to the idea of anything other than plastic carry bags.

“We would also like to switch to environment-friendly packaging, and have stocked cloth bags here. But, customers, who often come without bags of their own, demand carry bags for free. We have to charge anywhere from ₹5 to ₹10 for the cloth bags, depending upon the quality. Many customers are reluctant to buy carry bags at such prices. So, it becomes difficult for us,” says Ashraf, a shopkeeper at Palayam.

Fines

As per the government’s order banning single-use plastics from January 1, fine amounts ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹50,000 can be imposed for violations. The banned articles include non-woven polypropylene bags, plastic table spreads, disposable plates, cup, spoon, fork and straw made of plastic styrofoam, PVC flex, plastic water pouch and plastic bottles.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/corporation-all-set-to-enforce-plastic-ban/article30447279.ece
370,2020/01/01,"Revelry, stirs usher in New Year","As the city rang in the New Year on Tuesday night, the air was filled with the mood of celebration as well as protest. Even as large numbers of youth, predominantly male, from across the city and outskirts began to converge on the Kovalam Beach by 10 p.m., to take part in the beach-side revelry, protest meets against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens, were seen in many parts of the city.

But, unlike the anger of the protests from the past weeks, these protests to mark the New Year, was notable for their calmer vibes. One such gathering was witnessed along the Kovalam-Kazhakuttam bypass at Eeenchakkal Junction. Titled Constitution Protection Night, the protest-celebration meet, stretching from 6.30 p.m. on Tuesday to 6.30 a.m on Wednesday, saw the coming together of politicians of various hues and a humble New Year eve dinner of tapioca and rice gruel.

The All India Students Federation organised a candle-light protest in front of the Secretariat on Monday night, against CAA, while the Social Democratic Party of India organised a protest in front of the Raj Bhavan till midnight.

Lively air

On the Kovalam beach, the main venue of the celebrations in the city, the Tourism Department had organised various events as part of the celebrations. A chenda melam troupe on the move, which walked along the entire walkway along the beach, enlivened the atmosphere with their rousing beats, making the onlookers too join in the fun. The crowd consisted more of domestic tourists than foreigners.

High-end restaurants and clubs, decked up for the occasion, hosted performances by celebrity singers, music bands, DJs and comedy groups. Most of the hotels and resorts on the beach had a full house for the night.

The police personnel were on their toes for much of the evening, ensuring that the celebrations remained peaceful. At a temporary control centre set up near the beach, visuals from the entire beach area under CCTV surveillance, played on.

372,2020/01/01,Paddy procurement begins,"Procurement of paddy by the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation has begun in this district where light rain is being experienced occasionally in several parts of the district.

According to sources, direct purchase centres (DPC) have been opened at 53 places in Orathanadu and Thanjavur blocks to procure paddy. They were opened at places where the requirement for a DPC came from farmers, from December 20, 2019. A total of 398.520 tonnes of paddy had been procured till December 31, 2019 as per the guidelines announced by the corporation.

However, Orathanadu farmers, who normally go in for early samba cultivation of medium term varieties, were in fix as they feel that under the present conditions it may not be possible for them to get their produce measured at the DPCs in view of moisture content rule of the corporation.

Though the meteorological department indicate that north-east monsoon was retreating, the delta region continues to get light showers occasionally and it was confirmed by weather predictors who have said light showers might occur for the next two to three days, said the Nasuvini Riverbed Dam Farmers Development Association president V.Veerasenan.

Besides, there is early morning dew. In view of water flow in Grand Anaicut Canal and in sub-canals/channels branching off from it, the moisture level of land mass particularly in ayacuts continue to be high. So, it might not be possible for farmers to meet the stipulated maximum moisture content of 17 %. Even drying the paddy using hot air blowers may not work out as the moisture level in the harvested paddy might be in the range of 20 to 23 % or even more.

If the corporation is firm on moisture content rule, it could procure paddy from February or March because then only the moisture content would come down to 17 % or below, he said.

Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association secretary S.Vimalanathan said this situation was not a new one and it has become a recurring feature whenever the farmers were able to see through the samba cultivation. In order to negate the impact of moisture content rule during initial days of procurement, the corporation would apply for relaxation to the Union Government through the State Government.

A meeting of stake holders in paddy procurement has to be convened. “But this meeting was not convened this year in view of local body elections. Had they convened the meeting and recorded views of paddy producers, officials could have approached the Centre and got the moisture content rule relaxed by this time,”,he said.

Meanwhile, Collector M.Govinda Rao inspected the procurement process being carried out at Neivasal and Keezha Vuloor DPCs in Orathanadu taluk on December 31, 2019. He visited the TNCSC godown at Chennampatti where 4.57 lakh gunny bags had been kept ready for procurement purpose. In all around 78 lakh gunny bags were in possession of the corporation to carry out the samba-thaladi procurement exercise in Thanjavur district, sources said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/n78q2k/article30456991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY02DPC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/paddy-procurement-begins/article30453044.ece

374,2020/01/01,Trial run of bio-mining project to begin soon,"The trial run of bio-mining project to reclaim the dump yard in Ariyamangalam will begin on January 7.

Though the ₹49-crore project was awarded a year ago, the condition of the agreement between the Tiruchi Corporation and the private firm that bagged the project, says that the yard should be reclaimed completely within two years between January 1 and December 31,2021.

The firm had set up the plant and machinery to segregate garbage piled up for more than five decades. It has set up 30 conveyors and trommel machines in different parts of the 48 acre dump yard. The firm is all set to begin the operation.

Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian said the yard had accumulated 7 lakh cubic meters of solid waste, deposited over several years. It would be completely removed within two years and the entire land would be reclaimed. The plant and machinery set up at the yard had a capacity of processing and segregating about 1,000 cubic metres of waste a day.

He said that the trommel would filter and segregate garbage in different sizes. It would segregate usable, recyclable, debris and non recyclable items. They would be transported to the needy groups and firms. The plastic items would be transported to cement companies in Hyderabad and Gujarat.

He said the segregated garbage would have to disposed or sold to private companies by ensuring the norms of Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and the Central Pollution Control Board.

375,2020/01/01,Marigold growers left in lurch,"Sourcing of marigold flowers from other districts by traders at Kumbakonam market has dealt a blow to the local producers.

In view of the heavy rain in Kumbakonam belt this season, farmers who used to raise marigold flowers in late October and early November in their fields, took up cultivation a bit late this year.

Flower market traders looked for other options and signed contract with marigold cultivators in Hosur, Denkanikottai, Salem, Dharmapuri and Tiruvannamalai districts to meet the demand during Karthigai-Margazhi season. Thus around 30 tonnes of marigold flowers were delivered to the market every day.

Meanwhile, local cultivators have started harvesting flowers from last week of December and when they brought their produce to the market it was not received well by the traders. Because, they had signed contract with the other district producers.

So, local producers were forced to dispose off their flowers at throwaway price as the traders did not want to pile up their stock even though the sale of this flower used to fetch high rate in view of the festive season.

Flower traders justified their position by pointing out that stocking this flower beyond two days would not be remunerative as such stocks would have to be dumped in garbage bins only.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/marigold-growers-left-in-lurch/article30452998.ece

377,2020/01/01,Major infrastructure projects still in limbo in Tiruchi,"The year that has passed by has been a mixed bag for city residents in terms of infrastructure development.

Although the Tiruchi Corporation has been able to initiate some projects under the Smart City Mission, it has not been able to make much headway on certain long-pending proposals including establishment of an integrated bus stand. Given the stiff resistance from traders, it has not been able to get the wholesale traders of Gandhi Market shifted to the city outskirts either.

The proposal of establishing an integrated bus stand in the city has failed to make any tangible progress even after Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami made a commitment that the city would get the facility soon. In October 2017, Mr. Palaniswami announced in the city that the bus stand would be established at Kottapattu. But the suitability of the location was questioned by many and apparently the site was rejected.

Subsequently, the corporation pushed for the establishment of a bus port with assistance from the Union government and sent request through the State government to include Tiruchi under the list of cities where bus ports are planned to be established by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways but this proposal too has failed to take off.

Meanwhile, the corporation decided to redevelop and remodel the Central Bus Stand even while making some noise on initiating steps to get the Defence land at Mannarpuram for establishing the integrated bus stand. A proposal would be forwarded to the State government through the district administration, the previous Commissioner N.Ravichandran had said. But since then there has been no word on the matter.

The proposal, many city residents point out, had been pending for more than two decades now. The corporation had mooted the proposal in the mid-1990 and initially identified a site Devadhanam, which was later rejected on the ground it was flood prone. Since then various sites had been considered but none was finalised.

“The city sorely misses an integrated bus stand. We hope steps will be initiated to establish one in 2020,” observed M.A.Aleem, senior neurologist in the city and member of Tiruchi District Welfare Committee. He lists the expansion of the Tiruchi airport runway, better air and rail connectivity, new tourism attraction such as a theme park and winch for the Rockfort and an air ambulance service among major expectations of residents.

Several other residents are sore over the delay in completing the multi-level road overbridge near the Railway Junction as the Defence Ministry is get to give its nod for transfer of a small piece of land. “We hope at least 2020 will be a better year for Tiruchi’s development; the city has long been neglected. The few Smart City projects, which have taken off, should be given a push and completed quickly. Roads across the city need to be re-laid and sanitation should be improved on priority,” observed R.Gopal, a resident of K.K.Nagar.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/v887u4/article30457034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY02BUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/major-infrastructure-projects-still-in-limbo-in-tiruchi/article30452956.ece

383,2020/01/01,I have no plans to quit Telugu Desam: Ganta,"TDP MLA and former Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao on Tuesday said he had no plans to quit the party and join another outfit.

Addressing the media during his visit to a health centre at NGO Colony here, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said there was no truth in the talk that he would shift the party.

“The main issues that I have raised are being sidelined and such rumours are ruling the roost,” he said.

While welcoming the idea to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital, he said hat justice should be done to the farmers of Amaravati who had given land for building the capital under the land pooling scheme. “People of the city have also raised concerns over the law and order problems that may crop up if the city is made the Executive capital. Such issue should be addressed before taking any decision,” Mr. Srinivasa Rao said. “I will abide by party president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s decision to support the farmers of Amaravati,” he added.

“The project would be taken up in 10 corridors with a massive investment,” he told the media here on Tuesday.

Shifting of capital

Alleging that the protest launched by the farmers from Amaravati region over the plans of shifting of capital was ‘politically motivated’, Mr. Prasad Reddy said the farmers in the city had not resorted to such ‘tactics’ despite parting with 26,000 acres to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, 20,000 acres to Visakhapatnam Port Trust, 3,000 acres to NTPC Simhadri, 3,600 acres to Jawaharlal Nehru Pharma City, Parawada and 4,000 acres to A.P. Special Economic Zone, Atchutapuram.

Welfare schemes

Dubbing 2019 as a politically eventful year, he said people of the State had given a massive mandate to Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

“Former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had become the darling of masses for delivering good governance. Now, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy is carrying it forward by implementing welfare measures under ‘Navaratnalu’,” he said.

He said the government has taken several welfare measures such as merger of APSRTC with the government, increasing pensions for the aged and widows and weekly off for police personnel among others. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy is commited to the development of ports at Ramayapatnam and Machilipatnam, complete Polavaram irrigation project, interlinking of Godavari, Krishna and Tugabhadra and Handri Neeva Sujala Sravanti and construction of an international airport proposed at Bhogapuram, he said.

Several measures are being taken to check crimes against women under the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Criminal Law (Amendment) Act-2019, popularly known as Disha Act, which was passed by the Assembly after the brutal gang rape and murder of a women veterinarian in Hyderabad.

387,2020/01/01,Vizag registered 180% rise in cybercrime cases in 2019,"Cybercrime has topped the list of offences reported from the city in 2019, with a whopping 180% rise when compared to last year, Police Commissioner R.K. Meena said here on Tuesday.

“Around 280 cybercrime cases were reported this time when compared to 100 in 2018. The property loss in cybercrimes has been estimated to be more than 50% of the total figure of ₹7.89 crore for all categories of crime,” said Mr. Meena while addressing the annual media meet.

Forensic lab

Cybercrime will be among the top three priorities of the Police Commissionerate in 2020. “We have plans to strengthen cybercrime police station and cyber forensic laboratory,” he said.

However, Mr. Meena said there was a drop in the overall crime rate, while bodily crimes, white-collar crimes and crimes against women witnessed a marginal increase.

There was a drop in all categories of crime under this segment such as house break-ins, robberies, snatchings and two-wheeler thefts,” said Mr. Meena.

Accident count drops

388,2020/01/01,"We were originally Hindus, says Bangladeshi author Sharbari Zohra Ahmed","U.S-based Bangladeshi author and playwright Sharbari Zohra Ahmed feels that the people of the country of her origin are more alike than different from Indians as they were originally Hindus.

But Bangladeshis now want to forget their Hindu roots, said the author, who was born in Dhaka and moved to the United States when she was just three weeks old.

Also read: Love, loss, war and the fight for freedom come together in Sharbari Zohra Ahmed’s debut novel

Ahmed, who is the co-writer of the Season 1 of Quantico, a popular American television drama thriller series starring Priyanka Chopra, rues that her identity as a Bengali is getting lost in Bangladesh due to the influence of right-wing religious groups.

“How can Bangladesh deny its Hindu heritage? We were originally Hindus. Islam came later,” Ms. Ahmed said while speaking to PTI here recently.

“The British exploited us, stole from us and murdered us,” she said about undivided India, adding that the colonialists destroyed the thriving Muslin industry in Dhaka.

Ms. Ahmed said the question of her belief and identity in Bangladesh, where the state religion in Islam, has prompted her to write her debut novel Dust Under Her Feet.

The British exploitation of India and the country’s partition based on religion has also featured in her novel in a big way.

Ms. Ahmed calls Winston Churchill, the British prime minister during World War II, a “racist”.

“He took the rice from Bengal to feed his soldiers and didn’t care when he was told about that.

“During my research, I learnt that two million Bengalis died in the artificial famine that was created by him. When people praise Churchill, it is like praising Hitler to the Jews. He was horrible,” she said.

The author said her novel is an effort to tell the readers what actually happened.

“Great Britain owes us three trillion dollars. You have to put in inflation. Yet, they (the British) still have a colonial mentality and white colonisation is on the rise again,” Ms. Ahmed, who was in the city to promote her novel, said.

The novel is based in Kolkata, then Calcutta, during World War II when American soldiers were coming to the city in large numbers.

The irony was that while these American soldiers were nice to the locals, they used to segregate the so-called “black” soldiers, the novelist said.

“Calcutta was a cosmopolitan and the rest of the world needs to know how the city’s people were exploited, its treasures looted, people divided and hatred instilled in them,” she said.

‘Direct Action Day’

“Kolkata was my choice of place for my debut novel since my mother was born here. She witnessed the ‘Direct Action Day’ when she was a kid and was traumatised. She saw how a Hindu was killed by Muslims near her home in Park Circus area (in the city),” Ms. Ahmed said.

Direct Action Day, also known as the Great Calcutta Killings, was a massive communal riot in the city on August 16, 1946 that continued for the next few days.

Thousands of people were killed in the violence that ultimately paved the way for the partition of India.

Dust Under Her Feet is set in the Calcutta of the 1940s and Ahmed in her novel examines the inequities wrought by racism and colonialism.

The story is of young and lovely Yasmine Khan, a doyenne of the nightclub scene in Calcutta.

When the US sets up a large army base in the city to fight the Japanese in Burma, Yasmine spots an opportunity.

The nightclub is where Yasmine builds a family of singers, dancers, waifs and strays.

Every night, the smoke-filled club swarms with soldiers eager to watch her girls dance and sing.

Yasmine meets American soldier Lt Edward Lafaver in the club and for all her cynicism, finds herself falling helplessly for a married man who she is sure will never choose her over his wife.

Outside, the city lives in constant fear of Japanese bombardment at night. An attack and a betrayal test Yasmine’s strength and sense of control and her relationship with Edward.

389,2020/01/01,"PM-Kisan, mandi reforms steal the agriculture show in 2019","Good monsoon may have laid the foundation for record foodgrain production, but it was the launch of schemes like PM-Kisan that has set the ball rolling for structural reforms in the agriculture sector to achieve the target of doubling farmers’ income.

The Centre’s focus in 2019, continued to be ‘kisan kalyan’ (farmers’ welfare) in the second term of the Modi administration and the policy changes were as per the recommendations by the Dalwai Committee for doubling farmers’ 2015-16 income level, in real terms, by 2022.

Not only the budget allocation for the sector was hiked over 78% to ₹1.39 lakh crore for the current fiscal, the government persuaded states to adopt long pending agri-marketing reforms as per the Model Agriculture Produce and Livestock Market Committee (APML) Act.

Besides, it tweaked some existing schemes for promoting quick transfer of new farm technology and facilitate agri-exports by allowing treatment of Methylcyclopropene (MCP) for enhancing the shelf life of fresh fruits and vegetables among others.

To mitigate severe agrarian distress, the government launched a new agri-scheme the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan), just before the Lok Sabha polls, with an aim to provide direct cash benefit of ₹6,000 annually to each of 14 crore farmers. Later it also unvieled an old age pension scheme the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maan-Dhan Yojana.

“By and large the government’s priority was on improving the farmers’ income and accordingly the schemes were framed and some existing ones were tweaked to achieve this objective,” Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar told PTI in an interview.

Asserting that several of the Dalwai Committee’s recommendations are being implemented, the Minister said, “the work is in progress, the results will be visible soon.”

On foodgrain production, the Minister said despite delayed but good monsoon, untimely rains in some states like Maharasthra and Karnataka affected some kharif (summer) crops, the country’s overall foodgrain output is expected to be better and most likely will surpass 281.37 million tonne achieved in 2018-19 crop year (July-June).

The prospect of rabi (winter) crops like wheat are “extremely” good because of better soil moisture and good weather conditions, he said.

Mr. Tomar, however, noted that the country is self-sufficient in many commodities and the government’s policy has shifted from production-centric to farmers’ income centric.

The government has set a production target of 291.1 million tonnes of foodgrain in 2019-20 crop year (July-June). Already kharif (summer) crops have been harvested, the sowing of rabi (winter) crops is coming to end soon.

According to experts, the year was no doubt “better” in terms of prices that farmers got for their produce when compared to last two years even though the rising food inflation was a concern with retail onion prices touching the peak of ₹200/kg last month due to estimated 25% fall in kharif output of the key kitchen staple, they said.

On export front, India — which exports nearly 14% of the total marketable surplus — faced problem in shippping basmati rice due to new pesticide residue level set by the European Union. Non-basmati rice and sugar shipments were also hit as global prices were lower than the domestic support price, they added.

Asserting that much awaited agri-market reforms are underway finally in the country, government think-tank Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand said, “the trend has begun now. Many states have started adopting mandi reforms which is a real game changer in the agriculture sector.”

North eastern states have adopted fully the new Model APLM Act, while some states like Uttar Pradesh have adopted it partially even as the Centre is pursuing with the state governments to implement all the provisions of the law, he said.

Tamil Nadu has become the first state to adopt fully the model contract farming law that will pave way for food processing and better post harvesting. The government has kept the contract farming out of the ambit of Essential Commodities Act.

Besides these reforms, the government this year allowed inter-state trade on the electronic National Agriculture Market (eNAM) platform in 12 states.

However, the efforts to plug the holes in the procurement system and address the gaps in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme through the new program Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) could not give desired results owing to lack of state government’s support, experts observed.

The government also banned KCC loan against gold, plugged duplication and linked the KCC with aadhar number. With these changes, the government is aiming to bring additional 2 crore farmers under the KCC by June 2020. At present, 7 crore farmers are enrolled.

The overall farm sector growth stood at 2.90% in the 2018-19 fiscal. It was 2% and 2.1% in the first and second quarter of the 2019-20 fiscal, respectively, he added.

Next year, the government has mega plans to leverage farmers’ data collected under the PM-Kisan scheme for providing better facilities to farmers. The data will be linked with land records, Kisan Credit Card (KCC), crop insurance, soil health card, and other important schemes.

The government is also likely to launch few more schemes in the forthcoming budget that would bring a major shift in the agriculture sector.",agriculture,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/ri7etx/article30451183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KISANDIWAS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/agriculture/pm-kisan-mandi-reforms-steal-the-show-in-2019/article30451186.ece
