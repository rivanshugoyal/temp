0,2020/02/02,A government that is clueless on the economy,"It has long been suspected that the Narendra Modi government lacks a deep understanding of India’s economy, how it works and how to assess its condition at any point in time. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget speech of over two-and-a-half hours was mainly an exercise in tom-tomming the achievements of the government, particularly “the Prime Minister”, with an announcement of some income tax cuts thrown in for good measure.

It was difficult to find in it either the gravitas fit for the occasion, the annual Budget presentation of a country of 1.3 billion people, or the economic intelligence necessary to address the present, two attributes one would expect.

Low on economic intelligence

In a Budget speech, the government is expected to provide a review of the state of the economy and how it will be addressed via revenue and expenditure operations being proposed.

After Manmohan Singh’s performance in 1991, the country expects a slightly higher level of economic intelligence, if not analysis, on display in the Union Budget. While not all Budget presentations since have measured up to this standard, this one fails miserably.

Watch: sector-wise highlights from the Budget

Going by the Budget’s thrust, the government is either clueless as to what the economy needs right now or has chosen to brazen it out. The slowing of the economy has been remarked upon for at least two years by now, and the cries have by now almost reached a crescendo. Slowing growth is only part of the story. Less visible in the data optics is the high unemployment rate, the highest in close to half a century. Listening to the Budget speech, one would not get the slightest sense of this. We are told that the fundamentals are strong, that the economy is set to attain the projected $5 trillion level on time, and that the government is committed to macroeconomic stability (read ‘deficit reduction’).

Modinomics and tax reforms

This Budget only takes forward ‘Modinomics’ with its emphasis on ‘minimum government’ and fascination with digitalisation, IT start-ups and foreign direct investment. There is room for all of these on their own but to think that they make up a package of measures to address the present state of the economy would be naïve.

If there is a core to the Budget, one that may be taken as the strategy it embodies, it would be the attempt to stimulate growth through tax reforms. The Budget is quite elaborate in this area. It proposes a simplification of tax filing for both firms (the Goods and Services Tax) and individuals (Income Tax) and speaks for amending the IT Act to allow for a “taxpayer’s charter” which will set taxpayers free from harassment, for the Finance Minister a sequel to the ending of the “dreaded inspector Raj”.

Then there is the ‘Vivaad se Vishwas’ scheme to settle tax disputes speedily and smoothly; tax compliance is to be strengthened; the tax refund process simplified; and taxation of Employee Stock Options (ESOPS) deferred for up to five years.

But the cherry on the cake is surely the reduction of the income tax rates on income less than ₹15 lakh, which the Finance Minister clarified will leave income tax rates in India the lowest they have ever been. By lowering the income tax rate, the programme of cutting taxes which had commenced with the lowering of the corporate tax rate in 2019 has been carried forward.

We are not given the rationale for the tax cut, perhaps because that would draw attention to the fact that the economy is slowing and the target of $5 trillion by 2025 is unlikely to be achieved now. But one thing is clear.

An income tax cut is unlikely to restore the rate of growth to the level at which it last peaked, around 8% in 2016-17.

Actually, the question is whether it will even reverse the current slowing. Income taxpayers are such a small percentage of the population that the size of their purses is unlikely to make a serious enough dent on the fortunes of the economy.

Need for public investment

The present moment in India had called for a Budget that implements an expenditure thrust in the form of greater public investment. The Minister repeated the government’s statement, made last year, that there will be ₹100 lakh crore worth infrastructure spending in the next five years but did not refer to a specific infrastructure spending plan in this Budget.

This is not surprising as the ₹100 lakh crore is to be made up by substantial private outlays projected under Public Private Partnership (PPP). PPP, as a mode of building infrastructure, was first envisioned during the United Progressive Alliance’s second term, and has shown itself to be an unviable arrangement. There is no reason to believe that it will succeed this time.

While infrastructure spending is what will determine the long-term trajectory of the economy, the immediate growth impact of the Budget will be governed by the spending over revenues or the ‘fiscal deficit’.

We are told that the revised estimate for this deficit in the current year is 3.8% of GDP and the Budget estimate for 2020-2021 is 3.5%. If a fiscal deficit of 3.8% could not prevent the economy from slowing further last year, reducing it is only likely to aggravate it.

There is of course always the possibility that private investors are sufficiently enthused by the Budget to spend. Early indications from the stock markets is that this may not be the case.

1,2020/02/02,A Budget exercise that is designed for stressed times,"The Finance Minister’s job is a greatly coveted one but no politician would want to be in Nirmala Sitharaman’s shoes today. The Indian economy has slowed to a 5% crawl. The financial system is under considerable stress. Assumptions about tax revenues have gone awry. The clamour for government to ‘do something’ to get the economy going is deafening but there are simply no quick fixes.

What is the best any Finance Minister could have done in the Budget? Two things. One, nudge growth along through a higher-than-normal increase in government capital expenditure. Two, put in place reforms that would result in pay-offs over the long term. The Budget does surprisingly well on the first account. On the second, however, its performance will fall short of market expectations of a whole slew of structural reforms.

Most people thought that with the government facing a shortfall in total receipts of anything in the range of ₹1,50,000-₹3,00,000 crore, the axe would fall on government capital expenditure. The biggest positive in the Budget is that this has not happened in 2019-2020 and it is not projected to happen in 2020-2021 either.

Capital expenditure in 2019-2020 turned out to be ₹10,338 crore more than the Budget estimates, a rise in 13.4% over the actuals of 2018-2019. In 2020-2021, it is expected to rise by 18% over the figure for 2019-2020.

Capital expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 1.7% in 2019-2020 and is projected to rise to 1.8% in 2020-2021, assuming that the revenue projections hold substantially. The Finance Minister deserves credit for wanting to maintain the momentum of capital expenditure at a time of faltering growth.

Watch: sector-wise highlights from the Budget

Tax revenues below estimates

The receipts for 2019-20 are not as alarming as many had thought. Tax revenues (net to the centre) have fallen short of budgetary estimates by around ₹1,45,000 crore. The reduction in corporate tax rate last year cost the government nearly ₹1,00,000 crore. The fall in tax revenues has been offset somewhat by a rise in non-tax revenues of around ₹32,000 crore, mainly on account of a larger-than-projected transfer of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) surplus to the government. Disinvestment receipts have fallen short of budgetary estimates by ₹40,000 crore. In effect, the total disappointment in receipts has been of the order of ₹1,50,000 crore, which is at the lower end of market estimates.

A complete surprise is that revenue expenditure is lower than the budgetary estimate by ₹98,000 crore, mainly on account of a reduction in food subsidy. The net effect of the differences in receipts and expenditure with respect to budgetary estimates is an increase in the fiscal deficit by ₹63,000 crore, or about 0.3% of the budgetary estimate of GDP for 2019-2020. Factor in a lower-than-expected growth in the denominator, nominal GDP, and you end up with a fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio that is 0.5 percentage points higher than the budgetary estimate, that is, 3.8%. The Finance Minister has justified this by saying that it is within the deviation of 0.5% permitted by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.

Also Read Government bites the fiscal deficit bullet

For 2020-2021, the Finance Minister has projected a fiscal deficit at 3.5% of GDP, again a deviation of 0.5% from the plan given earlier. It is hard to fault the Finance Minister for not opting for an even bigger fiscal stimulus — after all, capital expenditure growth is not being compromised. Provided, however, the rest of the arithmetic for 2020-2021 holds up. Will it? Let’s take a look at the key numbers.

The projected growth in net tax revenue to the Centre, of 8.7%, is eminently reasonable, given a projected nominal growth of 10%. As for non-tax revenues, dividends and profits from public enterprises and the RBI have been assumed at a lower level than in 2019-2020. This suggests that transfer of surplus from RBI in the next year has been correctly assumed to be lower.

Disinvestment target

The big ‘if’ is about disinvestment receipts. The government expects to rake in ₹2,10,000 crore, way above the receipts of ₹65,000 crore in 2019-2020. The projected receipts include ₹1,20,000 crore from disinvestment in public sector undertakings and another ₹90,000 crore from disinvestment in LIC and IDBI Bank. The latter will, no doubt, be seen as significant reform of the financial sector by market analysts. However, both the intended sales raise issues. LIC performs a useful role in shoring up the stock market when required. It is also an important investor in the capital of public sector banks.

If institutional and retail investors are given a stake, the larger public role performed by LIC may be called into question. It would be best if a stake sale in LIC were referred to a Committee of Parliament. As for selling the government’s holding in IDBI Bank, the sale price could become a contentious issue until the bank effects a significant turnaround.

If the disinvestment estimates are not met, it would upset the budgetary arithmetic and the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of GDP. There is not even a pretence of meeting the FRBM target of 3% of GDP in the near future, not even by 2022-2023. Perhaps the time has come to revisit the target itself and the maximum deviation permissible from the plan. The suggestion that the government should aim to meet the target of 3% over an entire business cycle and not in any given year is worth considering.

There is some relief for income tax payers in the lower slabs. They have the option of choosing a lower tax rate or sticking to the existing one with exemptions. This makes the income tax system messier. Besides, some of the exemptions have to do with encouraging savings. If taxpayers shift away from exemptions in large numbers, it could have adverse implications for the domestic savings rate.

Market analysts expected the Budget to announce sweeping reforms. The Economic Survey listed a number of items that lend themselves to reform, like the Essential Commodities Act; drug price controls; foodgrain markets, etc. These find no mention in the Budget. Apart from stake sale in IDBI Bank, the public sector banking system has been left untouched. There is also no significant initiative in respect of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs). Asset monetisation is said to be the next frontier for raising revenues. The Budget mentions monetisation of roads covering 6,000 km by 2024 but one can’t find any corresponding numbers in the budgetary figures.

The Economic Surveys of the last two years have made the case for a serious thrust towards reliance on markets and private investment and a shrinking role for the government. There is no sign yet of any dramatic shifts. The political preference for caution and gradualism has not waned, which is just as well.

2,2020/02/02,A budget for the middle class,"Even if you are in the right track, you will get run over if you move slowly.

At the height of the debate on the economic slowdown, two ideas were being discussed. Should the government resort to heavy expenditure on infrastructure and the social sector? Or should it put more money in the pockets of the individual so that it can raise or push up consumer demand. The Finance Minister, in the Union Budget speech on Saturday, has accepted both ideas. Heavy expenditure is contemplated in Part A of the speech. This is the acceptance of the Keynesian concept of pump priming. Higher personal tax rates and slabs have been modified to the benefit of the middle class. This will certainly push up consumer demand. The fiscal deficit has been breached and will grow to 3.8% because of exceptional circumstances.

The middle class tax payer was upset that in September last the Finance Minister had chosen to confer a bonanza of ₹1,46,000 crore by way of lowering corporate tax rates with the individual getting nothing. Now, the concessions offered in the Budget will entail revenue foregone of ₹40,000 crore per year. This is all for the good.

The highest marginal rate has not been touched. India’s richest 1% have more wealth than 70% of the poorest. The combined total wealth of 63 Indian billionaires is more than the total Union Budget of India for the fiscal year 2018-19, which was ₹24,42,200 crore. Do they need relief? Certainly not.

Watch: sector-wise highlights from the Budget

Dividend distribution tax

The Finance Minister has done well to abolish the dividend distribution tax. It is a fact that it amounted to double taxation. The classical system of taxing dividends in the hands of individual shareholders is now accepted. The individual taxpayer can be aggrieved that there is no relief in the taxation of dividends in the hands of individuals. Probably a basic exemption of say ₹10,000 could have been granted to the individual shareholder. The new system also involves an element of double taxation. Just as interest on capital is made deductible, can interest on capital of the shareholders on an estimated basis be made deductible?

It was expected that a scheme such as the samadhan for service tax and central excise would be announced. Litigation is unending and prolonged. Huge moneys are locked up. The success rate of the department in appeals is very low. The Finance Minister has announced a scheme under which the taxpayer can pay just the disputed tax and get a complete waiver of interest and penalty. This will take us nowhere. The time limit is short and the compromise is no compromise at all. Under the “Sabka Vishwas Scheme” for indirect taxes, the taxpayer was allowed to get away by paying 30% or 40% depending on the case. Why this discrimination?

Corporate tax collections are pegged at ₹6,81,000 crore for 2020-21 up from ₹6,10,500 crore last year. Income-tax collections are estimated to be ₹6,38,000 crore for 2020-21 as against ₹5,59,000 crore last year. This despite the revision of tax rates and slabs. Does it show a fall in collections? Certainly not. There will always be criticism of anything and everything done by this government. The Budget is a critique of the economy and what it can achieve. This way it is a good budget and the Finance Minister deserves full compliments.

Tax administration

The Finance Minister has taken note of complaints of tax harassment and has promised a tax payers charter. This is frequently resorted to by Finance Ministers. To be effective, this should be part of the statute book and enforceable. It will also ensure accountability.

Also Read Govt intends to remove all income tax exemptions in long run: FM

N.A. Palkhivala once called the Income Tax Act a national disgrace. It had suffered hundreds of amendments. The Finance Minister has removed around 70 out of 100 exemptions and deductions provided in the Income Tax Act and promised a review and rationalisation of the law in order to simplify the tax system and lowering the tax rate. It was this Finance Minister who thought of the option of a higher rate with exemptions and a lower rate without deductions. Millions have seen apples falling from trees. But it was only Isaac Newton who wondered why. There can be no question of doing away with the Income Tax law. We wish the Finance Minister luck in her attempt to simplify the law.

Budget objectives may look ambitious. There can be no question of slowing down and the implementation has to be fast and forceful.

3,2020/02/02,Another lost opportunity to revive growth,"The Union Budget this year was presented in the background of a slowing economy, poor investment climate, declining consumption demand and stagnant exports. It was hoped that the strong electoral mandate that the government had received in 2019 would propel it to embark on substantial structural reforms to reverse the trend and revive the investment climate to accelerate growth.

In fact, the Economic Survey that preceded the Budget presentation declared, “The government must use its strong mandate to deliver expeditiously on reforms, which will enable the economy to strongly rebound in 2020-21”.

Alas, that has not happened. In fact, there is a complete disconnect between the Economic Survey and the Budget. There is no measure to create wealth in the Budget, as propounded by the Survey, nor is there anything to generate an atmosphere of trust.

A disappointing speech

The Budget speech read out by the Finance Minister was perhaps the longest in history, running to almost two hours, until the Minister herself could not carry on any longer. However, the markets were not impressed.

Almost two-thirds of the Budget speech was devoted to subjects that come within the constitutional domain of the States and, in the remainder, there was not much to cheer about.

Watch: sector-wise highlights from the Budget

The response to even issues such as the abolition of dividend distribution tax, which otherwise should have been received well, was muted. There was endless wait, with a fond hope that some important announcement would be made over the long duration of the Budget speech, only to end in disappointment. The slippage in fiscal deficit from the target set in the Budget estimate in 2019-2020 was a foregone conclusion. This is mainly due to: the nominal GDP growth being 7.5%, as against the estimated 12% in the Budget; the expectation that the tax revenue was to increase at 18.3% over the pre-actuals of the previous year; and, lastly, the progress in disinvestment being tardy and that only about ₹18,000 crore of the budgeted ₹1.05 lakh crore has been realised so far.

It is not surprising that the fiscal deficit for the current year stands estimated at 3.8% of GDP and the target for the next year is 3.5%. Thus, the slippage for both the years is 0.5 percentage point to GDP. Of course, off-Budget financing has continued and that makes the reported deficit numbers somewhat of doubtful validity. Besides, there are questions on whether even these estimates will be realised when the actual numbers are finalised.

Also Read Government bites the fiscal deficit bullet

It remains to be seen whether the total estimate of ₹65,000 crore of disinvestment proceeds will be realised, which implies that the government will have to fast-track disinvestment to collect ₹47,000 crore in the next two months. Besides, the revised estimate of tax revenue for the current year is over 14% higher than the actual for 2018-2019, perhaps predicated on the hope that the scheme, “Vivad se Vishwas”, of allowing the settlement of disputed tax to be paid without interest and penalty.

There are downward risks in achieving the targeted fiscal deficit of 3.5% in 2020-2021 as well. The nominal GDP growth looks reasonable but it is not clear how the other non-debt capital receipts will be realised.

The capital expenditure is estimated to increase by 18%. Despite this, the revenue deficit is higher at 2.7% of GDP as compared to 2.4% this year and is almost 77% of the fiscal deficit.

Echoes from the past

The abolition of dividend distribution tax and taxing it in the hands of the shareholders at applicable rates was expected. In fact, there has been considerable zig-zag on dividend taxation policy over the years. The reforms in individual income tax, however, are clearly disappointing. The best practice approach to tax reform is to broaden the base, reduce the rates and reduce the number of brackets to make it simpler. Clearly, the main objective of any tax should be to raise revenue.

The government could have simply phased out the tax concessions, indexed the brackets for inflation and reduced the rates of tax, with appropriate adjustment in brackets. Instead, it has created six brackets which takes us back to the pre-1991 era of income taxation. The protectionist stance for import substitution in the name of “Make in India” has also continued, which too takes us back to the pre-reform era.

Drop in revenue expenditure

On the expenditure side, there has been a sharp compression of revenue expenditures by 4% and the capital expenditure is shown at 3% higher in 2019-2020 over the previous year.

Much of the compression in revenue expenditures was in the Central sector (12%) and Centrally sponsored schemes (4%). In 2020-2021, the revenue and capital expenditures are estimated at 12% and 18%, respectively, higher than the current year.

Also Read For every rupee in govt kitty, 64 paise come from taxes

Despite many announcements in the Budget on schemes relating to subjects in the States’ domain such as agriculture, irrigation, rural development and health, the expenditure on the Central sector and Centrally sponsored schemes is budgeted to increase at 7.6% and 7.3%, respectively, next year.

In other words, a considerable part of the expenditure compression in 2019-2020 was borne by the States, and while the overall expenditure of the Centre is budgeted to increase by 12.7% next year, the increase in the transfers on account of the Central sector and Centrally sponsored schemes would be just about 7.4%.

On the whole, the Budget fails to provide any kind of stimulus for the revival of consumer or investment demand. Nor has it been able to contain the deficits and that leaves very little room for further cuts in repo rates by the monetary policy committee.

The Budget is also supposed to provide clear policy signals. Mere announcements that there will be a doubling of farmers’ incomes and there will be ₹102 lakh crore investments in the next five years are not likely to revive the sentiments.

In short, the country has missed yet another opportunity to retrieve the economy from the throes of stagnancy.

4,2020/02/02,No fireworks: On Nirmala Sitharaman’s second budget,"Nirmala Sitharaman’s second Budget is not a spend-and-stimulate exercise despite the fact that it has overrun the 3.3% target on fiscal deficit by as much as 0.5 percentage point. Nor is it a feel-good budget even accounting for the new tax regime for personal income tax with lower rates. It reflects the difficult circumstances under which it has been drawn up: falling tax revenues, rising borrowings and the need to rein in spending. It will certainly disappoint those who were expecting a big bang stimulus in terms of increased public spending or additional boost for investment. There were calls in the run-up to the Budget for the Finance Minister to relax the fiscal deficit target so that she could spend to revitalise the economy. In the event, as things turned out, Ms. Sitharaman did oblige them on the deficit front but that was more to compensate for the less-than-expected growth in revenues and not for extra spending. She has taken cover under a clause in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act that gives her leeway to breach the set target.

That said, the Budget has been built on the assumption of a nominal GDP growth rate of 10% in 2020-21, which does appear optimistic given the state of the economy now. The nominal growth rate for fiscal 2019-20 as per government estimates is 7.5%. The recovery from here has to be sharp to justify next year’s projection. The gross tax revenue growth projection of 11.99% also appears very optimistic especially because it has been built on the premise of a 11.54% rise in corporate tax collections. Given the slowdown in profit growth and the lower corporate tax rate now, it is debatable if this projection can be met. And then, there is the huge ₹2,10,000 crore revenue assumed under disinvestment proceeds. This is based on the successful culmination of the disinvestment process in Air India and Bharat Petroleum, both of which have been set in motion, and on the planned disinvestment of equity in the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) through an IPO. In addition to this, the government has also budgeted for receipts from the telecom players — of ₹1,33,027 crore — which, apart from the regular licence fees and spectrum charges, also includes the arrears that they would now have to pay consequent to the Supreme Court verdict that went against them. Just to put the importance of these two non-tax revenue items in perspective, they together account for over 11% of total receipts budgeted for the next fiscal. On the expenditure side, the Minister has extended a tight fist with allocations for major social sector schemes being maintained at about the same level as the budgeted estimates of 2019-20. In the case of MGNREGA, the allocation of ₹61,500 crore is lower than the revised estimate of ₹71,002 crore in 2019-20, though it is marginally better than the budgeted estimate of ₹60,000 crore last year. The spending on most heads of social sector schemes in 2019-20 has been much lower than the budgeted levels, including in the much spoken about PM KISAN scheme where the government spent only ₹54,370 crore compared to an outlay of ₹75,000 crore. The projected outlay of ₹75,000 crore under this head in the coming year shines only because of the lower spending in 2019-20. In fact, this can be said for most schemes such as the PM Gram Sadak Yojana, Ayushman Bharat and BharatNet where this year’s outlay appears higher only because of the much lower spending in 2019-20 compared to what was budgeted for. The compression in spending is a reflection of the extent of revenue shortfall this fiscal.

A highlight of the Budget is the proposal for a new scheme of taxation on personal IT where assessees can pay lower tax rates if they agree to forego all exemptions. Though this has attracted maximum attention, the fact is that to most taxpayers, it may not be as attractive as it appears. It may benefit those who do not claim deductions on housing loan repayments and who do not pay large insurance premium. Most of the popular exemptions and deductions like housing loan repayments, house rent allowance, leave travel concession and the concessions under Section 80C such as on life insurance premium, public provident fund contribution and under Section 80D on medical insurance premium will not be available to those who opt for the new scheme. The lower tax rates they will enjoy will be negated by the absence of these sizeable deductions for those who are already claiming them. If the taxpayers feel they are disappointed, it is understandable.

But savers and investors have reason to be happy as the insurance cover on bank deposits has been increased to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh now. This will give them a measure of security in these uncertain times when bank frauds and defaults are becoming more frequent. But savers who are also investors have reason to complain as they will now be liable to pay tax on dividend income. The regressive dividend distribution tax has been abolished and with this the reforms on the corporate tax front have taken another big step forward. The other noteworthy proposal is the disinvestment in LIC where the government proposes to sell a part of its stake, unspecified as yet, through an IPO. That this is not going to be easy to put through is evident as unions have already raised the banner of revolt. The government has also adjusted import duties on a laundry list of items ranging from walnuts and toys to catalytic converters and fans. Some amount of thought seems to have gone into this as this list is largely made up of products where India has the manufacturing capability but has been a victim of cheap imports, sometimes riding on advantages from free trade agreements. In sum, there is nothing spectacular about this Budget which rides on optimistic growth estimates. Whether it flies or falls flat depends on how growth pans out in the economy in the next four quarters.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-fireworks-the-hindu-editorial-on-union-budget-2020-21/article30715279.ece
5,2020/02/02,Cubbon Park to be ‘redeveloped’ under Smart City Project,"One of the city’s prime lung spaces, Cubbon Park, does not enjoy some of the privileges that the other green space – Lalbagh – does. Now, the park is all set to be ‘redeveloped’ with ‘major design interventions’ under the smart cities project. Bengaluru Smart City Limited (BSCL) is expected to begin work within two months and the project is expected to cost ₹40 crore.

However, at a public consultation meeting on Sunday, citizens raised concerns of increasing concretisation of the park, heavy vehicular movement and the noise and air pollution that is choking the park. They also questioned if further ‘development’ would pose a threat to the natural heritage of the park.

Ananda Thirtha, a civic activist, asked why a park should be redeveloped under a smart city scheme. “I hope they do not turn it into a tech park kind of space,” he said.

Another participant, Bobby Kapoor, who has been coming to the park for decades, said, “Why should they fix something that is not broken? What they can do is plant more varieties of plants and reduce vehicular movement within the park.”

Addressing the participants, BSCL Managing Director Hephsiba R. Korlapati said the park would be developed in two phases at a cost of ₹20 crore each. “Sustainability, accessibility and inclusivity are our main goals. We will keep in mind these and redevelop the park without disturbing nature in any way,” she said.

Neelam Manjunath, Chairperson, Bamboo Society of India, Karnataka Chapter, said that a bamboo oxygen park will be developed inside the park, which will also act as an oxygen park. “Almost all structures, including toilets, security posts, and cafeterias, will be built using bamboo. There will be bio-fencing, which will stop dust and sound pollution,” she said.

She said that bamboo will be grown in the park. “Earlier, they grew bamboo because it released more oxygen. It also filtered water by removing toxicity in the water,” she said.

Speaking at the sidelines of the meeting, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar, said that an oversight committee will be set up for execution of the project. “The committee will have senior officials from all the government agencies concerned. We will also have people, domain experts and activists in the committee,” he said.

P.C. Mohan, Member of Parliament, Bengaluru Central, assured the participants that the project will be a ‘coordinated effort’. “I came here in the morning to talk to people, many of whom expressed a desire for an open gym and better playing amenities at Jawahar Bal Bhawan. I will talk to the authorities concerned so that even Bal Bhawan is bought under the smart cities project,” he said. All elected representatives and senior officials of various government departments assured the public that their inputs would be incorporated ‘as much as possible’. “We will ask everyone to send suggestions via email and earnestly go through them and incorporate the prudent ones,” said Mr. Anil Kumar.

Ban on parking

Increasing vehicular movement and parking inside Cubbon Park has been a complaint raised by regular walkers and citizens.

On the sidelines of Sunday’s meeting, BBMP Commissioner B.H.

6,2020/02/02,Youth arrested for patricide,"A 19-year-old was arrested by the Soladevanahalli police on Saturday for allegedly bludgeoning his father to death over a drunken brawl in their house on Thursday.

According to the police, the deceased, Dodda Chowdappa, 56, is a native of Madhugiri taluk in Tumakuru district. He was a peon in a nationalised bank. He was staying with his wife and two children in Ganapathi Nagar.

Investigations revealed that Chowdappa was a chronic alcoholic. He would reportedly go home drunk every day and harass his wife and family members.

On January 28, he went home drunk and allegedly assaulted his wife. Enraged by this, his son Gahan picked up a ladle and beat up Chowdappa. Later, Chowdappa went to his room to sleep. When his wife went to wake him up the next morning, he was dead.

The family members allegedly decided to make it seem like a natural death. They informed the neighbours and relatives that Chowdappa died due to excessive drinking. The family began preparations for the cremation. A few neighbours, who had overheard the fight, alerted the police.

The Soladevanahalli police took up a case of suspicious death and sent the body for post-mortem. On Saturday, the police received the report, which stated that the death was due to assault. A detailed inquiry with the family members led Gahan to confess to the crime.

Gahan, who is studying diploma in a private college, told police that he had no intention of killing his father. He attacked him only to stop him from assaulting his mother.

The police booked Gahan for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/youth-arrested-for-patricide/article30721497.ece
7,2020/02/02,Angry mob attacks BMTC conductor,"Tension prevailed in Sulibele on the outskirts of the city on Saturday evening when a group of people pelted stones at a BMTC bus and assaulted the conductor.

The police rushed to the spot and arrested four persons. Efforts are on to track down the others involved in the attack.

According to the police, the incident occurred when a middle-aged man got into the bus headed from Hosakote to Doddaballapura, and occupied the seat reserved for women.

Basavaraj, 38, the conductor, asked him to vacate the seat, but the man refused. A heated argument ensued between them for some time. The man got down when the bus reached Sulibele.

He narrated the incident to villagers accusing the conductor of humiliating him. Enraged by this, the villagers attacked the bus while it was heading from Doddaballapura to Bengaluru. The attackers stopped the bus and told the passengers to alight before pelting stones at the vehicle. They later dragged the conductor out and assaulted him, the police said.

On being alerted by some passers-by, police rushed to the spot and managed to nab four persons.

Team formed

8,2020/02/02,9-year-old boy attacked by pack of dogs,"A nine-year-old was attacked by a pack of dogs in a wooded area near Vibhutipura lake, Vigyan Nagar ward coming under Mahadevapura zone, on Saturday.

The victim, Nirmal, sustained injuries on his head, hands and thighs. He is undergoing treatment at Victoria Hospital.

According to Mallappa Bhajantri, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Assistant Director (Animal Husbandry), the condition of the boy was stable. “Various tests, including CT scan, were conducted. The reports are normal. The child may be discharged after a couple of days,” he said.

Nirmal’s parents are from Nepal. His father Surjan works as a security guard and mother Srijana is a daily wage labourer, he said.

“The boy was attacked when he wandered into the wooded area alone. Passers-by heard him scream for help. They shooed the dogs away and rescued him,” said Dr. Bhajantri.

He said the victim was first rushed to a private hospital where he was given first aid. He was then taken to the super-speciality hospital where immunoglobulin and anti-rabies vaccination were administered. The BBMP, he added, is bearing the entire cost of treatment.

On Sunday, the BBMP's Animal Husbandry Department had rounded up two dogs from the area. Stating that none of the dogs had rabies, he said the department was keeping a watch on the other dogs.

For the past several years now, the BBMP has been implementing the Animal Birth Control (ABC) programme to control the stray dog population. The recent dog census estimated the stray dog population to be around 3.09 lakh.

Apart from revealing that only 1.68 lakh stray dogs were neutered, the census showed that the stray dog population was more in the five outer zones of Mahadevapura, Rajarajeshwarinagar, Dasarahalli, Bommanahalli, and Yelahanka. In these zones, the population of stray dogs is pegged at 1.97 lakh. In the densely populated core zones – East, West and South – the figure is around 1.09 lakh.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/vvv3ah/article30721460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGSTRAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/9-year-old-boy-attacked-by-pack-of-dogs/article30721462.ece
9,2020/02/02,"Baby shower, family photo shoot for police personnel","The police have been finding unique ways to keep up the morale of the staff amidst their stressful work life.

Staff of Channammanakere Acchukattu police station took a few hours off last week and managed to make the station resemble a function hall as they organised a traditional baby shower for two constables, a day before they set off on maternity leave.

Some personnel cleared the furniture of the station to set up a stage while others got busy decorating the venue.

Soon, family members of the staff arrived and were seated minutes before Veeramma and Lakshmi were escorted to the stage. The family members sang songs. The two constables were gifted bangles, flowers, fruits, and sweets.

A sumptuous lunch was arranged for everyone and the two constables were given a grand send-off.

In an emotional speech, the two constables thanked their colleagues for the honour and support.

Inspector Puttaswamy H.P., who organised the event, said that the station is the second home for the personnel, and they are all part of a family.

“A baby shower is usually organised by the families, but we wanted to convey the message that our staff is also part of a family, and we care as much as they do. By doing this, the bond of mutual respect among the personnel has increased,” he added.

10,2020/02/02,Incident of suspected child trafficking keeps police on their toes,"A 36-year-old man who was riding a scooter on Thursday night in Koramangala with his year-and-a-half-old son seated precariously in the leg space, sparked concern among citizens. After receiving an alert from a traffic warden, the police spent the better part of the night trying to track the man down as they feared it was a case of child trafficking.

On Friday night, they tracked him down to his residence on Haraluru Road and learnt that the suspect, Susheel Pradhan, had left his house with his son after a row with his wife. “He hails from Bihar but is unemployed as he is an alcoholic. His wife works as a domestic help,” said the police.

The couple had recently separated. On Thursday, Susheel came to the house asking for money. While his wife was busy with household chores, he grabbed the toddler, who was sleeping, placed him in the narrow leg space of his scooter and rode way. When he stopped the scooter at the PVR junction signal in Koramangala, traffic warden Manju Mehra saw the child and started questioning Susheel. She also took a few photos on her mobile phone, which she posted on social media.

When Susheel sped away, Ms. Mehra alerted the police control room. Suspecting a case of child trafficking, the Koramangala police swung into action. Three special teams were dispatched to track him down.

“The scooter belongs to his brother who works in an eatery in Koramangala. Based on the information he gave us, we rushed to Suisheel’s house to find his wife with the boy,” said a police officer. She told the police that Susheel had taken the child without informing her, but returned him on Friday as he was unable to take care of him.

Inspector Shashidhar S.D. summoned the couple and counselled them before letting Susheel off with a warning.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/incident-of-suspected-child-trafficking-keeps-police-on-their-toes/article30718192.ece
11,2020/02/02,"A welcome Budget, but implementation is key: KASSIA","The Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association (KASSIA) has welcomed the Union Budget 2020, while cautioning that everything hinges on the implementation as Budget measures need to be effectively followed and executed in a federal set-up.

R. Raju, president, KASSIA, welcomed proposals such as simplifying GST filing of returns and the measures to help rural economy by directing investments to agriculture and related areas.

However, on a cautionary note, the KASSIA said: “One gets an uncomfortable feeling that the Budget has tried to address a number of issues and may have unwittingly missed the wood for the trees. The problems facing the Indian economy now require measures to put back on track growth in investment and consumption, which seem to be missing. We believe this is the central issue for the economy to help employment and income.”

KASSIA has also said that the general measures proposed to revive the economy, such as creation of the investment clearance cell, higher insurance cover for exports, reversion of duties and taxes on export products along with the special focus on electronic and semi conductor equipment manufacturing value chains, would provide the necessary stimulus needed to revive the economic growth in the country.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/a-welcome-budget-but-implementation-is-key-kassia/article30718191.ece
12,2020/02/02,New mothers at Ponneri hospital find books to be a stress buster,"A shelf of books is not quite what one would expect in a maternity ward, with its buzz of new borns, anxious mothers and hovering grandmothers.

But at the Ponneri Government Hospital, Chief Medical Officer S. Anurathna has initiated a novel form of therapy — a library of over 500 books — to help patients tide over their stay in the hosptial.

“This is a hospital with 104 beds. Usually women who get admitted for delivery stay in the hospital for nearly 10 days. And there are other inpatients, too. I noticed that most of them were fiddling with their mobile phones to kill time,” says Dr. Anurathna.

Around two years ago, she decided to start a library. “I donated 100 books from the library in my house and gradually many others started donating books. Many of the inpatients, who had dropped the reading habit after school, now borrow books and return them when they are discharged,” she adds.

The range is eclectic — from Tamil novels and books on health and family welfare published by the government to Kalki’s classic set Ponniyin Selvan and inspirational books on former president Abdul Kalam, Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda and a few English books — there is no dearth of choice on the shelves.

The literary therapy has got a positive response from the patients. “Most of them are under some kind of fear or stress when they get admitted. Many have told me that they find peace while reading the books. Some women said they were encouraged to pursue higher education after picking up the reading habit again,” adds Dr. Anurathna.

“Now the nurses and doctors in the hospital also borrow the books. They all have noticed changes in their stress levels and attitude towards life,” a pleased Dr. Anurathna says.

The doctor says that she will promote reading whenever and wherever possible. “I was able to come up in life because my teachers instilled the reading habit in me during my school days. It can help others too, especially the younger generation,” she adds.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2rzu8y/article30722182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02WOMANREADINGBOOKjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/new-mothers-at-ponneri-government-hospital-in-tamil-nadus-thiruvallur-district-find-books-to-be-a-stress-buster/article30720226.ece
13,2020/02/02,Art-integrated learning finds room in Chennai’s CBSE schools,"Learning mathematics through kolam patterns and origami, clay modelling to depict geographical landforms, and putting up skits at the end of English lessons — with the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) having called for the implementation of art-integrated education for all classes, many of its affiliated schools in the city have taken steps to do just that over the last year.

“We have focused on not just integrating arts with regard to teaching, but the assessment pattern as well. Instead of simply administering worksheets or tests, we are encouraging children to present what they have learnt in the form of songs, skits or art models. Across classes, children are enjoying this process,” said K. R. Maalathi, adviser, SRM Public School, Guduvanchery.

While murals were used to depict latitudes and longitudes, the musical instrument jal tarang was brought into class to teach younger students about water as a part of a science lesson.

Working together

At the Vikas Mantra Public School in Chengalpet, Ms. Maalathi said that the mathematics and art departments worked together to introduce art-integrated learning from Classes I to IX with diverse activities such as quilling, glass painting and doll-making.

The guidelines issued by the CBSE state that art-integrated learning can be implemented in classrooms through an ice-breaking activity to introduce a topic and undertaking trans-disciplinary projects for cohesive understanding among the students.

At the Chennai Public School, Thirumazhisai, students got to participate in a mock Lok Sabha session to better understand how the Indian Parliament system works, and even passed a Bill. For lessons on politicians and keeping up with current affairs, they are encouraged to prepare and enact mock interviews with elected representatives.

Scope for creativity

“While some schools have for long practised art integration, the CBSE guidelines have encouraged all schools to stop solely focussing on marks and exams. This has given a lot of scope for creativity and critical thinking which has made students happier learners,” said Lakshmi Prabha, Principal, Prasan Vidya Mandir.

Among the school’s interventions are origami, kolam patterns, story-telling and traditional games to teach mathematics. “Learning mathematics through traditional games, for instance, has resulted in children developing a great deal more interest and affinity to the subject,” she noted.

Mangala Madhavan, Principal, Shri Ram Universal School, said that for effective teaching and learning to happen, students have to undergo some kind of experience. “Instead of being singularly focused on driving the concept home, teachers can use visual aids or incorporate various forms of music or art, which will enhance the learning experience so that students can connect better to what is being taught,” she explained.

Not sidelined

In several schools, art classes are often kept in the sidelines or even done away with in favour of other subjects. “Teachers, instead, should be focusing on how they can effectively integrate art forms students are familiar with and which are being taught in art classes, into their regular subject classes,” she added.

To aid the implementation of art-integrated learning in schools, the CBSE has been conducting workshops for prospective resource persons across cities. Chennai, too, hosted such a workshop recently.

“Across schools, we have tweaked our lesson planning strategy to explore how new concepts can be introduced in classrooms through some form of art,” said Asha Nathan, Principal, Chennai Public School.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qopmj3/article30723634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3THART,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/art-integrated-learning-finds-room-in-chennais-cbse-schools/article30720205.ece

15,2020/02/02,Court convicts 15 of 17 accused in Ayanavaram rape case,"A special court to try cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act on Saturday convicted 15 of the 17 accused charged with grave offences, including aggravated penetrative sexual assault, on an 11-year-old hearing impaired girl in Ayanavaram in 2018. The judge will pronounce the quantum of sentence on Monday.

An accused was let off and another died during the trial.

The All-Women Police arrested 17 persons — all of them service staff at the residential apartment where the girl lived with her family. The accused had developed an acquaintance with the victim and reportedly committed aggravated sexual assault and aggravated penetrative assault on several occasions, from January 15 to July 14, 2018.

Apartment staff

The prosecution alleged that the child was unable to understand what happened to her, and that she was raped by 17 persons, on several occasions, over a period of six months. The crime came to the notice of the girl’s parents when they took her to a hospital after she complained of stomachache.

The accused were employed in the apartment complex as lift operators, electricians, plumbers, security guards and gardeners. The apartment association had engaged them through three agencies. Lift operator Ravikumar, 56, is said to have initiated the sexual assault. Other offenders followed him, the prosecution claimed.

The trial was conducted by special public prosecutor N. Ramesh before special judge R.N. Manjula. One of the accused, N. Babu, died of ill health during trial, and 16 others went on to face trial. On Saturday, amid tight security, the 16 offenders were brought to the court complex, located on the Madras High Court premises. The court conducted in-camera proceedings.

On the production of the offenders, the special judge, Ms. Manjula, held 15 of them guilty of offences they were charged with, and convicted them, while A.P. Gunasekaran was acquitted. Later, she questioned them about the quantum of sentence to be imposed against them. After recording their individual replies, the judge adjourned the matter to Monday to pronounce the quantum of sentence on them.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/j1hi44/article30718181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2THAYANAVARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/court-convicts-15-of-17-accused-in-ayanavaram-rape-case/article30718182.ece
16,2020/02/02,Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget is a mixed bag for the State,"The Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday had two specific announcements for the State — Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway and development of Adichanallur as an iconic site.

However, it did not have announcements pertaining to requests that Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam had made during the pre-Budget meeting.

The Deputy Chief Minister had sought funds for the Godavari-Cauvery linking scheme and phase-II of Chennai Metro.

Funds were also sought for the Nadanthai Vazhi Cauvery project to rejuvenate the river and its tributaries.

The Hindu last month reported that the Centre was unlikely to fund this project.

Constitutional obligation

Mr. Panneerselvam had pointed out that the Centre was constitutionally obliged to pay GST compensation to the States.

On the positive side, the Union Finance Minister said that the compensation dues for 2016-17 and 2017-18 would be paid in two instalments out of the collections.

Revenue share

According to the Budget Estimates for 2020-21, Tamil Nadu will get ₹32,849.34 crore as share of net proceeds from taxes and duties. Of this, the share of Central GST has been pegged at ₹9,942.63 crore.

The State will get ₹10,104.36 crore from the Corporation Tax and ₹9,395.25 crore from Income Tax.

The State’s share of central excise duty is ₹1,339.60 crore and Customs is ₹2,050.31 crore, according to Budget Estimates for 2020-21.

Estimates revised

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu will get ₹26,392.40 crore as share of net proceeds for central taxes and duties for 2019-20, which was revised downward from ₹32,551.42 crore estimated in last year’s Budget.

The Budget makes a mention of overhauling centrally-sponsored schemes and central sector schemes. Any major changes implemented could hurt the State finances.

Mr. Panneerselvam had sought payment of dues under various schemes.

The exact details of what Tamil Nadu gets under various schemes is not yet clear. The State is likely to benefit from the announcement of a scheme to boost manufacture of mobile phones, electronic equipment and semi-conductor packaging and medical devices.

Thrust on infrastructure, affordable housing, tourism, agriculture and aim to end manual scavenging through adoption of suitable technologies will also benefit the State.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/4ieaio/article30716855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Win-some-lose-somecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nirmala-sitharamans-budget-is-a-mixed-bag-for-the-state/article30716856.ece
17,2020/02/02,Governor awards degrees at 10th convocation of law university,"Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Saturday presided over the tenth convocation of the Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University, also in his capacity as its chancellor, and awarded degrees to 2,938 candidates, of whom 2,713 received degrees in person, and 225 in absentia. The degrees were awarded in the presence of Supreme Court judge Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai, Madras High Court Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam.

In his convocation address, Justice Gavai said lawyers serve as a crucial interface between those who seek justice and those who deliver it. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the learned advocates to persevere till their clients get complete justice, he said. “As members of the legal profession... you must ensure that the doors of justice always remain open for the aggrieved, downtrodden, indigent, exploited, vulnerable and the marginalised,” he stressed.

He also recalled noted jurist Mohammadali Carim Chagla as having said that being a lawyer was a profession and not a trade or business. “The distinction between the two is deep and fundamental. In business, your sole object is to make money. In the legal profession, making money is merely incidental. You have traditions to which you have to be true... service to society and your fellow men has to be the dominant motive underlying your work.”

Earlier, Chief Justice Sahi, in his special address, said personal behaviour, maintaining a high ethical standard, and exhibiting a strong character were some of the primal facets which had to be observed by every lawyer. “I say this, that in contemporary times, even though it still remains the noble profession, law is looked up with respect, but unfortunately, at times, in public opinion, lawyers are suspects,” he pointed out.

Urging lawyers to improve upon such opinions by their professional conduct, he said their intellect should be guided more by common sense, logic and applicability of law to life, rather than prowess of superior intelligence, that might lead only to theoretical heights without pragmatic results. “Your job is the most difficult in the world, and that is the art of persuading the human mind to believe that whatever you are saying is the best.”

“Today’s society, as civilized as it is today, is still strewn with strife, where tensions mount high due to rival thoughts — be it the issue of thickness of a pin or the width of the galaxies. A lawyer, therefore, has to train himself and his mind to keep within the confines of the cause, but at the same time, not let his imagination be curtailed, as a petty problem today might become a universal problem tomorrow.”

“Illustrations are not far to see whether the throwing of a paper on the roadside is only a petty nuisance or the dumping of nuclear garbage in the seas is a far greater threat to humanity. Lawyers and members of the legal profession, in whatever field they are, their devotion of thought process has to travel the entire horizon, conquer mirages, and at times, even travel into the unknown,” he said. The university’s vice-chancellor, T.S.N. Sastry, also spoke.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rs1cyg/article30716834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2THLAW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/governor-awards-degrees-at-10th-convocation-of-law-university/article30716835.ece
18,2020/02/02,Father smears chemical on daughter’s face,"A retired head constable allegedly smeared a chemical on his pregnant daughter’s face in Tiruvallur, after she married against his will.

He also attacked her in-laws when they tried to rescue her, the police said.

According to the police, Deepika married Saikumar, 21, of Veppampattu, against the wishes of her father Balakumar, a retired police constable. After the marriage, the couple shifted to Bengaluru. After she was pregnant, she stayed with her in-laws in Veppampattu.

Knowing this, Balakumar, along with three others, went to the in-laws’ house on Friday and asked her to come meet her ailing mother. When she refused, Balakumar and his accomplices smeared the chemical on the victim’s face, thinking it was some kind of anaesthesia, in an attempt to take her away.

Her mother-in-law and sister-in-law tried to rescue her, but the men smeared the chemical on their faces too, and took Deepika away. After they spotted burns on her face, they sensed troubled and dropped her on the Veppampattu Main Road, and sped away.

She informed the Sevvapet police, and the police admitted the three to the Tiruvallur Government Hospital. The police are searching for Balakumar and his gang.

20,2020/02/02,Coronavirus testing facility to be operative by tomorrow,"The King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, will be ready to test samples for the novel coronavirus (nCoV) from Monday. The laboratory will give out results on samples within 48 hours, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said.

“The King Institute has been designated a laboratory. The testing reagents arrived on Friday. A trial run is being conducted now, and will be completed tomorrow. Clearance from the National Institute of Virology, Pune, will be obtained, and it will be ready for testing from Monday,” she told reporters on Saturday.

So far, 3,223 passengers have been screened at the airports — thermal screening at the Chennai and Tiruchi airports, and symptomatic screening at the Coimbatore and Madurai airports, she said. “A total of 579 travellers from China and transit countries are under observation.

The two persons who were admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and the Government Thiruvannamalai Medical College Hospital were asymptomatic, and no samples were lifted for testing, she said.

Airports have been asked to provide more hand sanitisers and step up sterilisation of surfaces, Dr. Rajesh said. “All airlines, not just from China, will now make announcements asking travellers to fill in the self-declaration forms,” she said.

An additional isolation ward had been set up at the Tambaram Government Hospital, she added.

While adequate personal protective equipment had been stocked, mock drills were also conducted.

The Department will distribute bilingual pamphlets with an advisory for the public, she added.

21,2020/02/02,The Hindu Education Plus fair gets under way,"International education is a vital component in developing leadership skills among students, said Robert G. Burgess, U.S. Consul General in Chennai. He was delivering the keynote address at the inauguration of the 17th edition of The Hindu Education Plus International Education Fair 2020.

“While I know that it can be difficult for students to leave home and go some place unfamiliar, there is a lot to be gained by opening yourself up to new places, cultures and horizons,” he said.

Stating that international education would help students collaborate with peers across the world and give a global perspective on what is crucial in today’s dynamic world economy, Mr. Burgess said that there would be new ideas exchanged, stereotypes dissolved, fast friendships formed and invaluable connections made.

While there were great opportunities available for students in India and across the world, Mr. Burgess encouraged them to find the right place for themselves, to develop skills and expand horizons.

Students and parents thronged the fair on Saturday, and had the opportunity to attend sessions on higher education opportunities in France and study options in the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. A discussion on how to crack the GRE and GMAT was also held.

The fair had 29 stalls, put up by premier foreign universities, visa counsellors and finance experts. S. Ankit, a student who was visiting the fair, said that he was looking forward to hearing about opportunities for higher education in Europe.

The education fair will also be held on Sunday, from 10.30 a.m. to 5 p.m., at Taj Coromandel, Nungambakkam.

22,2020/02/02,An exercise bereft of macroeconomic vision,"Though Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman laboured for well over two hours when delivering the Union Budget speech, it is likely that the aspect of the speech that will receive popular attention would be the restructuring of income tax slabs and reduction in rates that would benefit the tax paying middle class. That was obviously also the intention of the exercise.

Budget 2020-21 was being presented at a critical time for the economy, with growth decelerating sharply, and evidence of adversity not just in the informal economy but in the corporate sector as well. With official data suggesting that, even prior to 2019-20, unemployment was at a record high and agriculture was languishing, news of slowing growth was disconcerting. The pressure on the Finance Minister to show that she is making an attempt to kick-start the economy was considerable.

Window dressing

But her hands were clearly tied by circumstances and ideology. Tax revenues, that fell short in 2019-20, could not be expected to rise sharply in the coming financial year, when growth would remain sluggish. Obsession with reporting (not necessarily achieving) only a small deviation from the medium term target of 3% of GDP, limits debt financed spending. And the experience of 2019-20 seemed to suggest not too much could be garnered from disinvestment when times were bad. In the circumstances, even showing a reasonable increase in expenditure, let alone an effort at a major stimulus, had to be an exercise in window dressing.

No comparisons

Faced with those constraints, the Finance Minister has chosen to shift the attention of those listening. She wore down her audience and herself, with a long discourse on her government’s achievements and plans centred ostensibly around the three themes of “aspirational India, economic development and a caring society”. Not all the points made and examples provided fell easily under those labels. But it gave people enough to want the speech done with and not complain that they were not getting the detail they needed to assess what the government plans to do to address a bad situation.

Moreover, departing from past practice, allocations made in different areas such as agriculture, sanitation and nutrition were reported as absolute figures with no comparison either to the previous year’s Budget or revised estimates. The tone in which the numbers were read sought to signal that the sums involved were large, though subsequent comparison of these figures with the previous year’s Budget estimates indicate that there has been no major step up in expenditure. Overall, the ratio of total expenditure to GDP that was budgeted at 13.6% of GDP in 2019-20, and estimated to touch 13.2%, is projected at 13.5% in 2020-21. That amounts to near standstill.

Watch: sector-wise highlights from the Budget

It was to strengthen the attempt at diversion, the Finance Minister possibly chose to offer, following her bonanza for the corporates in September last year, significant tax concessions to a middle class for which much of annual income falls in the ₹5 lakh to ₹15 lakh range. She also removed the dividend distribution tax currently levied on corporates and left dividend income to be taxed as income of the recipient. If estimates reported in the speech turn out correct, these together would entail a revenue loss of ₹65,000 crore.

On the fiscal deficit

These revenue losses should make things even more difficult when it comes to staying close to the fiscal deficit target, even at the modest expenditure levels projected. Yet, according to the Budget speech, despite significant shortfalls in revenue in 2019-20, the fiscal deficit was at 3.8% rather than the targeted 3.3%, and that in 2020-21, it is projected at 3.5% as compared with the medium-term target of 3.0%. Underlying those numbers is the assumption of significant tax buoyancy in a period of depressed growth, a sharp increase in non-tax revenues from communication services of an estimated ₹74,000 crore following the Supreme Court’s judgment on computation of licence fees and spectrum charges, restrained expenditure estimates, and off-budget transactions. A telling example of the last of these is the food subsidy bill for 2019-20, which was a year when the Food Corporation of India (FCI) was saddled with huge stocks and would have to be compensated for the difference between the economic cost and price at which the grain is sold through the Public Distribution System. Since the FCI would have paid for procurement and incurred carrying costs and had to be compensated for food sold, the actual requirement of subsidy in a year when procurement and stocks were at record levels should have been high. But as against the provision of ₹1,84,220 crore in the Budget for 2019-20, the revised estimate for food subsidy is placed at ₹1,08,688 crore or 40% lower than the Budget estimate.

Falling allocations

Despite such adjustments, the Finance Minister has not been able to match her claims of ensuring development for all and a caring society with matching allocations. The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act programme on which ₹61,815 crore was spent in 2018-19 and ₹71,002 crore in 2019-20 (RE), is allocated only ₹61,500 crore in 2020-21. The scheme for the development of Scheduled Castes on which spending fell from ₹7,574 crore in 2018-19 to ₹5,568 crore in 2019-20, is allocated ₹6,242 crore in 2020-21. Such examples are legion.

Despite such massaging and pruning of the numbers, getting the needed fiscal-deficit-bottom-line has required reliance on ambitious targets for receipts from disinvestment. In the Budget for 2019-20, the Finance Minister had provided ₹1,05,000 crore from disinvestment. However, even by January 2020, receipts under this head stood at around a mere ₹18,000 crore. Yet, the “revised estimates” for 2019-20 (which are still projections) for receipts from disinvestment presented in the Budget papers for 2020-21 are placed at ₹65,000 crore. Obviously, the Finance Minister hopes for a big push on the disinvestment front in February and March. Such assumptions explain the marginal deviation from the fiscal deficit target in the current year.

But the disinvestment push cannot end this year. The Budget provides for disinvestment receipts of a whopping ₹2,10,000 crore in 2020-21. Of this, ₹1,20,000 crore is to come from disinvestment of non-financial public sector enterprises and another ₹90,000 crore from disinvestment of equity in public sector banks and financial institutions. Since the latter is accompanied by a call for public sector banks to turn to capital markets to raise resources from recapitalisation rather than rely on the government, the government’s share in equity could well reach levels where it loses control. In its desperation, the government also claims it plans to divest a part of its holding even in institutions such as the Life Insurance Corporation of India.

The inability of the government, despite such manoeuvres, to significantly raise its spending at a time when circumstances demand a proactive fiscal policy has a larger implication. It speaks of the absence of any macroeconomic vision for the management of the economy. That absence was clear in the text of the Budget speech that did not recognise the severity of the crisis that has engulfed the economy and the fisc and offered no way out of the crisis other than a promise to privilege wealth creation.

23,2020/02/02,The fine print,"The fine print

At first look, the Union Budget 2020 proposes reductions in income-tax slabs in a new tax structure which could perhaps put more money in the hands of the people to boost overall consumption. However, removing existing exemptions under the new structure could have a negative impact on crucial saving options such as insurance and deposits. Although the present tax structure has been retained for those wishing to claim exemptions as being done at present, it would have been wiser to continue with such exemptions in the new structure also, possibly with reduced upper limits than at present. In short, encouraging consumption at the cost of savings would not be very healthy for balanced, long-term economic growth.

On Saturday, we watched the excellent presentation of the Union Budget. On announcing changes to the IT slabs, and illustrated with examples, everybody clapped as if they had finally been granted some benefits at last. To their dismay, the Finance Minister announced it to be “optional” as to avail this long-awaited benefit one would have to forgo all “exemptions” we enjoy. Why such gimmickry?

The government needs to explain to the people the economic logic behind the move to list the Life Insurance Corporation on the stock exchange. The LIC does not need any fresh capital nor is there any urgency to expand. It has been consistently growing at an average rate of 20% annually despite competition from private players and continues to maintain a nearly 70% market share. Through listing, big corporates are sure to enter the boardroom of LIC and start influencing its investment policy which has till date been robust and prudent, based on the principle of people’s money for people’s welfare.

Coronavirus ready

It is evident from the recent declaration of a public and world emergency by the World Health Organisation that the deadly novel Coronavirus can be annihilated only through international cooperation. Accordingly, all countries should join hands in stopping the spread of the viral infection (Editorial page, “A sneeze, a global cold and testing times for China”, February 1).

Ominous interlinks

I am at a loss to understand how can anyone fail to see the link between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens and the impact the discriminatory nature of CAA will have on those left out of the NRC. Members of the ruling party and its top leaders are quick to repeatedly pontificate that no Indian citizen, especially Muslims, need not worry and that the CAA’s sole purpose is to legitimise the status of those who have sought refuge in India after being subjected to religious persecution in neighbouring countries by granting them citizenship. Anti-CAA protesters do not for a moment oppose this humanitarian gesture. Their opposition is to the CAA’s discriminatory nature which addresses the plight of the Hindus, Christians, Buddhists but excludes Muslims. Why should Muslims fear this law? In the course of implementing the NRC, a large number of citizens will be left out which will include all communities for not possessing proper documents demanded by the NRC as it happened in Assam. Hindus need not worry as the government has committed to granting them citizenship. Now what happens to Muslims left out of the NRC and whose numbers may run into lakhs? The government has not come clean on this.

Free speech

The debaters discussing the restrictions on free speech seem unable to decide whether the existing restrictions are cumbersome or whether they need fine-tuning because of their presumption that the current political atmosphere is oppressive (OpEd page, “Should restrictions on free speech be reviewed?” January 31.) Many of the proposals discussed, instead of infusing the law with certainty and clarity, could add layers of complexity and ambiguity to inviting judicial interventions. Cumulative incitement cannot be objectively determined and lends itself to subjective interpretations. The judicial doctrine of differentiating advocacy and incitement is problematic because eloquence can easily camouflage a call to revolt.

It appears that many people get into trouble with free speech laws, not because there are too many restrictions. It is because they fail to exercise self-discipline. People are often carried away and deliver inflammatory speeches that attract the clause on reasonable restrictions unless they disclaim any intention to foster enmity against the state and the government. While adjudicating cases of sedition, judges cannot extend extraordinary solicitude to the political beliefs of the accused and exonerate them merely because there has been no direct incitement to violence. In a climate of political animosity and distrust, advocacy often comes laced with insinuations and subtle hints of rebellion. The onus of proving innocence is on the alleged transgressors.

CRZ violations

While the violation of CRZ norms is widespread all along India, violations are greater in Kerala due to land scarcity. A better course of action would be to provide the statutory compensation, both in terms of land for dwelling and money, and rehabilitation well before demolition. Further, the argument that “the people who will be forced out of the illegal buildings may again construct houses and villas” is fallacious, because the fear of another demolition will surely be a deterrent. As a proactive measure to protect the coast from encroachments, a central CRZ Protection Guards/Force can be thought of (‘Ground Zero’ page, “Crisis along the coast”, February 1).

24,2020/02/02,Premier Badminton League | Priyanshu hunts down Keun,"Priyanshu Rajawat of Hyderabad Hunters produced a stunning performance to outclass World No. 49 Lee Dong Keun as the hosts registered a stunning 4-3 win over Mumbai Rockets in an inconsequential match of the Premier Badminton League at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Sunday.

Despite the victory, Hunters is virtually out of contention. It has 10 points, the same as Mumbai. Both have one match remaining.

The 18-year-old Priyanshu, whom chief National coach P. Gopi Chand rates highly, showed amazing maturity and composure. More importantly, he controlled the pace of the game with his net dribbles and telling smashes.

A trainee of the Gopi Chand Academy and ranked World No. 284, Priyanshu’s deceptive strokes caught the opponent off-guard repeatedly on the wrong foot, especially, in the second game.

Stunning result

Earlier, Hunters’ men’s combine of Ben Lane and Vladimir Ivanov lost to former World Championship doubles medallists Kim Gi Jung and Kim Sa Rang.

In men’s singles, P. Kashyap of Rockets clinched the Trump match with a clinical 15-8, 15-13 win over Daren Liew, giving his team a 2-0 lead. World No. 25 Kashyap ended his three-match losing streak in the PBL this season.

In Hunters’ Trump, World champion P.V. Sindhu won as expected against the young Shreyanshi Pardesi, taking just 20 minutes.

With the contest at 3-3, the hosts’ mixed doubles pair of Vladimir Ivanov and N. Sikki Reddy clinched the issue.

25,2020/02/02,National weightlifting championships from February 3,"With stricter measures to curb doping, the National weightlifting championship begins at the Khudiram Anusilan Kendra here on Monday.

The positive test of at least 16 weightlifters — mostly from outside the National camp — at the last edition in Visakhapatnam was a major embarrassment for the Indian Weightlifting Federation (IWLF).

For this edition, the IWLF has formulated a ‘whereabouts’ rule — modelled on the practice followed by various anti-doping agencies and international federations — to avoid recurrence of such an episode.

“The lifters have to provide information as to where and when they are training, under whom they are training in the last three months. We send these details to the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA). Those who do not provide the details cannot take part in the National championships,” said IWLF secretary Sahdev Yadav.

Some of the lifters who tested positive at Visakhapatnam had claimed they were not aware of a substance, SARM, being on the 2019 prohibited list. Asked about their claim, Yadav said, “We hold seminars. Everything is available on websites and everyone is aware of the changes.”

On the competition front, the event will feature Olympic aspirants, including former World champion S. Mirabai Chanu (49kg) and former Youth Olympics gold medallist Jeremy Lalrinnunga (67kg).

“All top lifters, including Mirabai, Jeremy, Achinta Sheuli and Rakhi Halder, will compete to see how their training is progressing. Those who have a serious chance at the Olympics are training at 90 per cent now. The idea is to peak at the right time,” said chief National coach Vijay Sharma.

Sharma said Mirabai, who is a medal contender in the Olympics, had done a total of 201kg and would like to improve her performance in the coming months.

The return of Railways’ Sanjita Chanu, who tested positive in the 2017 World championships, in women’s 49kg is another highlight. She became eligible to compete after the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) revoked her provisional suspension in January last year.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/national-weightlifting-championships-from-february-3/article30720783.ece
26,2020/02/02,National table tennis championship | Harmeet Desai tames Manav Thakkar for maiden title,"In a befitting finale, Harmeet Desai produced timely answers to all the questions posed by a spirited Manav Thakkar in a seven-set thriller.

Before this first all-Gujarat final in the history of National table tennis championship, top seed Sutirtha Mukherjee walked away with her second women singles title by brushing Krittwika Sinha Roy 11-4, 11-5, 11-8, 11-4.

Thakkar, the conqueror of an error-prone top seed G. Sathiyan in the semifinals, bounced back three times to force the decider but Desai was not be denied a 11-4, 11-13, 14-12, 9-11, 11-8, 5-11, 11-5 triumph. To Thakkar’s credit, he rallied from 5-9 in the fourth set to brighten his prospects.

Desai, clearly better prepared having lost for the first time to Thakkar in Kolkata this season, changed gears in the deciding set to open a big, early lead and crossed the line without being threatened.

After winning his semifinal against Soumyajit Ghosh — the man who ousted Sharath Kamal on Saturday evening — Desai was wary of Thakkar’s abilities.

“Manav had just beaten Sathiyan and, to be honest, I was ready to accept defeat, given the way he was playing. I was expecting him to return every ball. It was only in the decider that I got away,” confessed the champion, who finished runner-up to Sanil Shetty in 2014 at Patna in his only previous title-clash. ‘

Thakkar was gracious in defeat. “I think he played really well, especially in the decider and I could do very little. Overall, I am very happy with the way I played, with my first win Sathiyan being very special. ""

Sutirtha, champion in 2018, regained the crown by stopping last year’s finalist Krittwika in quick time. In fact, having claimed the bronze for Haryana in the team championship, Sutirtha also won the women doubles and finished runner-up in mixed doubles.

Recently-married Jubin Kumar won his fifth men’s doubles title after partnering Ghosh.

28,2020/02/02,"Table tennis | Ghosh stuns listless Sharath; Ankita reaches semifinals; Sathiyan, Sutirtha tested to the hilt","For Siliguri-based former champions Soumyajit Ghosh and Ankita Das, it was a memorable Saturday on their comeback journey.

Exceeding all expectations, these 2016 Rio Olympics debutants gate-crashed into the singles semifinals of the National table tennis championship here.

Champion in 2013 and 2015, Ghosh ended a listless Sharath Kamal’s title-defence 4-2. Ankita, the 2014 winner rallied from 0-3 to stun former champion K. Shamini and seventh seed Anusha Kutumbale.

Fighting marital matters in court and trying to set right things that went wrong from the eve of the 2018 Commonwealth Games, a grossly-overweight Ghosh chose to right stage to make a point.

His determined effort against the nine-time champion brought him the first three sets. Sharath, looking almost disinterested in the proceedings, did win some points at will and claimed the next two sets. But in the sixth set, when Sharath led 6-4, Ghosh pulled off six straight points and eventually halted Sharath’s unbeaten run since 2017.

Incredible day

Incredibly, the day saw Ghosh playing seven sets against S.F.R. Snehit and six by Sudhanshu Grover. He also played six sets in doubles — and remained unbeaten!

“If I had not won the sixth game, it would have been very difficult for me in the decider,” admitted Ghosh, who last beat Sharath to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics.

Sharath, on his part, said, “I was not in the match today. Perhaps, he needed to win more badly than me. I’m happy for Ghosh.”

Top seed G. Sathiyan, down one set to three and 1-3 in the fourth against Manush Shah in the pre-quarterfinals, trailed 1-2 against Ronit Bhanja before racing away with the last three sets. Sathiyan, will have to play much better on Sunday to emerge the winner.

Like Ghosh, fellow-resident from Siliguri, Ankita Das marked her comeback by storming into the semifinals. In the pre-quarterfinal, featuring two former champions, Ankita rallied from 0-3 to win 4-3 against K. Shamini, who suffered a shoulder injury during the match. Ankita went on to upstage seventh seed Anusha Kutumbale in the quarterfinals.

Top seed Sutirtha Mukherjee, too, rallied from 0-3 to oust Kaushini Nath 4-3 to reach semifinals against Ayhika.

The results (prefix denotes seed): Men singles: Quarterfinals: G. Sathiyan (Pet) bt Ronit Bhanja (Ben ‘A’) 11-6, 9-11, 7-11, 11-7, 11-7, 11-9; Manav Thakkar (Pet) bt Sarthak Gandhi (TTFI) 11-7, 11-6, 8-11, 11-6, 11-8; Harmeet Desai (Pet) bt Sanil Shetty (Pet) 12-11, 11-5, 11-6, 11-8; Soumyajit Ghosh (Har) bt Sharath Kamal (Pet) 12-10, 11-8, 11-7, 9-11, 7-11, 11-7.

29,2020/02/02,Cooking without the bulb,"December 13 was a memorable day in my life, one which would change my culinary traditions for the next couple of months. I was at the market for vegetable shopping with my husband when suddenly I was reminded of the news headline “Onion prices rise across the country”. Out of curiosity, I checked the price of the bulb. It was at a whopping ₹200 a kg.

The next instant, I dropped it back. What do I do now? This is too much! Though one part of me reasoned I could afford to buy half a kg, the other part was completely revolting. As an Indian, I am sure all of us would have faced this situation recently when onion prices skyrocketed in the country. After all, no Indian kitchen is complete without this pungent ingredient.

So, my mind frantically raced trying to solve the problem. Finally, that day I had made my decision, though it sounded a little harsh to me. It was that I would cook without onions till the price came down. This was my way of rebelling. I did the rest of the shopping and rushed back home still feeling heavy in my heart. For quite some time, I felt stupid. Can anything big happen to the Indian economy or onion price rise, if I stopped eating them?

I set out with the task on hand. As I opened my smartphone and tapped the words “recipes without onion-garlic”, everything seemed so daunting. One site said “use cabbage in place of onions”. At another I thought I had found a really lovely recipe for “dhaba-style dal tadka” without onion and garlic that my husband may like. But then did I have the courage to put what I made on the table? Well, it was another story altogether.

The first few days were a complete chaos with dishes turning extraordinarily spicy and oily as I didn’t understand this fact that onion-free cooking required so much less spice and oil as there is no onion to absorb them. This was a discovery. Great. That means I can do healthy cooking after all! Now that I had a grasp of how much salt, oil and spice should go into onion-free food, I now began to focus on flavouring it well.

If there was no onion in my kitchen, surely there were other things. So I began playing with elements such as coconut, jaggery, tamarind, ginger and coriander and began incorporating them into my ordinary everyday dishes with the result that one day at the table my children declared that dal was tasting like kurma or maybe even pav bhaji that day. I was quite thrilled at the ability of the humble dal to please the palate of my family. I then realised this was so much fun. The fact was that I had never been so excited to go to the kitchen before. Life was becoming easy without the tears caused by onions.

Following cook books and recipes and making exotic dishes are all well and good. Being complimented at the party for the food is surely pleasing. But making great dishes when one had everything in place is one thing and throwing a party with nothing much in hand is a completely different thing. And I had done that! By now I had practically cooked everything under the sun sans onions. Dal, paneer makhni, poori-chole, rajma chawal, malai kofta, stuffed parathas, pav bhaji, poha, the list goes on! Every time I put these perfectly made onion-garlic-free food on the table, my face beam with pride.

30,2020/02/02,Science and humanities must be on an even plane,"Engineering or medicine? That’s an age-old question faced by Indian students. The arts and humanities are out of the picture. Only those whose grades aren’t great study commerce or economics. But literature, history or political science? That must infer that the student has either failed or is rebellious.

But why does the average middle-class Indian parent think so? It’s simple — money. STEM majors earn much much more than others over a lifetime. If you want to venture a guess of what the lowest paying majors are, you’ll probably be right. Majors such as early childhood education, human services, visual arts and international studies — all part of the arts, humanities, and social sciences — pay far less. The dream of a secure financial future can seem rosy, but will it compensate for broken dreams and a world without innovation?

Those broken dreams have a scarring effect — data show that India is facing a youth suicide crisis, with suicide being the leading cause of death among those aged 15-39 in 2016. For the same year, suicide was was the third most common cause of death for that age group on the global scale. In Kota, a city renowned for its “coaching institutes” — cram schools which have continuous four-hour lectures — suicide rates are high. A large contribution to this rise is academic pressure, with many students being forced to abandon their dreams and study STEM. The time-consuming, monotonous and mechanical workload of STEM classes drives the creativity out of students, and leads to an increase in stress and anxiety.

Similar to how cram schools dry students’ creativity and ingenuity, it seems that the funding for the arts and humanities is drying up as well. R&D and manufacturing have been some of the largest contributors to India’s fast-growing economy, and STEM education has been placed at the forefront, with polytechnic institutes and IT schools popping up everywhere. The top STEM schools in India receive more government funds than Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), the nation’s leading liberal arts and social sciences university. The funding for JNU includes funding for its Schools of Engineering and Science, which results in even lower budgets for the arts, humanities, and social sciences. This gross imbalance shows the clear bias towards STEM.

If maths and the core sciences provide strong foundations, the arts and humanities help the flow of new ideas and perspectives born out of innovation, critical thinking, and creativity. Without the arts and humanities, STEM will be forever stuck in its current state, with little development and progress. The skills provided by the arts and humanities are essential for the progress of mankind into the next era. Was it the technical knowledge of Leonardo da Vinci which helped him make discoveries in anatomy, geology and optics? It was Da Vinci’s ingenuity and creativity which sparked his discoveries — not his knowledge of algebra. His technical and scientific abilities came into play as he developed his ideas. Da Vinci had the perfect combination of skills from both fields. He was a polymath.

A STEM education must not be spent only in laboratories looking under microscopes or sitting with calculators in front of stacks of paper. Colleges around the world infuse their STEM degrees with a general education in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, whereas 11th and 12th grades in India are usually devoid of any content resembling history, literature, or creative writing. At the Indian Institute

of Technology, Bombay, for a degree in computer science, only 4.5% of all credits must be from courses in the humanities or social sciences. For the same degree at Carnegie Mellon, around 20% of all credits must be from general education courses, which are mostly courses in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. There’s a difference in the rankings as well, with Carnegie Mellon being ranked three and the IIT-B below 50. The better university is providing a more well-rounded education, making their graduates better prepared to face real-world problems.

There shouldn’t be any argument of which field is “better”. Both STEM and the arts and humanities are important in their individual aspects. While the humanities and social sciences lay out the blueprints of mankind’s future, STEM starts building. There is no use creating a skilled workforce which lacks innovation or an understanding of humanity and society. STEM and the arts and humanities have become intertwined and it is time for India to understand that. The two fields are symbiotic in nature, and with today’s ever-evolving world, the boundaries seem to fade with fields like cognitive science.

Unfortunately, the old attitude still rules supreme in India. The principal of my school called the mother of one of the top achievers of the graduating class, and asked her why her son was choosing to study history, and not science. The most surprising thing was that the Hindi (second language) teacher called and asked the same thing. This mentality is present even in teachers of the arts and humanities, which shows how bad the situation is.

I’m not advocating for STEM or the arts and humanities. I’m advocating for a curriculum in which STEM and the arts and humanities are intertwined and symbiotic. It’s no use having a STEM major forced to study hours and hours of humanities or social sciences. But they do need to gain the critical thinking skills and ability to expand their perspectives to be well-rounded and successful in their career.

Similarly, arts and humanities majors could benefit from a better understanding of the physical world around them, or understand the beauty of mathematics or the functioning of a computer. It is time for Indian institutes to adopt more liberal general education policies, which will lead to better all-round development for their students, and the country as a whole.

I’m also asking parents to stop the pressure. Forcing children into engineering or medicine is contributing to the death of creativity, fragmentation of dreams, and an increase in anxiety and stress. Let them be “the music makers, and dreamers of dreams”, for they will be “the movers and shakers of the world forever, it seems”.

31,2020/02/02,For an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum,"As a child, I divided people into male and female categories. However, on numerous occasions, this binary would collapse. I have vivid memories of stopping at the traffic signal at Madhuban Chowk, watching a few tall, well-built individuals in bright-coloured saris conversing with random passengers in cars and scooters. I had seen them in my apartment complex on auspicious family occasions. They were a part of my living reality, but unfortunately, I never found them mentioned in my textbooks. It seemed that schools had a blueprint of a world that was different from mine.

A episode from school ingrained in my memory is the bullying of a ninth-grader by a gang of homophobic seniors. Later, I heard that the student withdrew from school after years of torment.

Bullying based on gender and sexual orientation has been going on in Indian schools for a long time. Rigid ideas about gender and sexuality that children imbibe in their early years escalate into bias and bullying in the later years. With the abolishment of Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in 2018, it is crucial to open up classroom spaces for courageous conversations. There is an imperative need to integrate an LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum right from the elementary grades.

Primary school teachers are ill-equipped to tackle conversations about diverse sexuality and heteronormativity. They tend to avoid such discussions as they feel obligated to preserve “childhood innocence”. Numerous research studies acknowledge the fact that children in primary school bring their sexuality into the classrooms and are aware of the diverse sexuality in their milieu. This awareness generates a need to prepare primary teachers in teacher education programmes to encourage courageous conversations around gender and sexuality in the classroom.

The notions about heteronormativity are conceived right from early childhood classrooms. Students acquire knowledge about sexuality through various multimedia avenues, along with different diverse family relationships that they encounter in school. However, teachers still view it as adult-only knowledge and not something for the primary students.

Concepts of sexualities are often a topic of controversy within elementary schools. In addition to this, the ideas of childhood innocence have affected the sex education curriculum, policy development and teaching practices in schools. However, some research studies show that primary school students are aware and talk about sexualities without intervention. But unfortunately, non-heteronormative sexualities are often missing from the context of primary school children.

Heteronormativity is often described as a universal discourse that contributes to the pedagogy being utilised by teachers. As a result, it normalises heteronormativity within the school system.

Kevin Kumashiro, an educationist, argues that rather than assuming that all students are heterosexual and sexually “innocent” and should leave their sexuality at home, educators must combat this situation by acknowledging the fact that students do bring their sexuality into the classroom. The categories of gender are often regulated by socially constructed practices and reinforced in the four walls of a classroom. Some researchers have studied the processes through which heteronormativity is maintained in schools. They discuss the active and passive means in school routines that reinforce heterosexuality, and the organisational structures in school that support heterosexuality as normal and rest as deviant.

Kumashiro has pointed at research studies which suggest that the knowledge that students have about the “other” is inadequate since it is distorted by their marginalisation. This problematic half-knowledge is internalised through the informal, or “hidden”, curriculum and carries more educational significance than the official curriculum. He suggests the integration of lessons on the “other” throughout the curriculum. This integration will enable educators to have a dialogue about the intersections of our various identities and the oppressions in that discourse.

“The strength of this approach is that it calls on educators to bring visibility to enrich their students’ understandings of different ways of being. In fact, by trying to treat other ways of being as something as normal as the normative ways of being, this approach attempts to normalise differences and otherness,” he says.

I recently saw the Tamil film Super Deluxe, and one thread of its story deals with a seven-year-old boy meeting his transgender “father” after a long period. The boy innocently questions “him” about “his” new identity. The “father” adequately explains a complex discourse in the most relatable analogies: “Sometimes, when we put on our shoes in a hurry, we confuse the left with the right. Similarly, god, in a hurry, put me in a male body.”

Conversations about LGBTQ can be as simple and child-centric as this. But we must begin somewhere.

Teacher education programmes aim to prepare teachers for diverse learners, but somehow leave out the LGBTQ questioning from its focus. Educators should work towards creating safe spaces and in the process, transform their identities in terms of providing and creating more equitable and humane classrooms and schools. Lesson plans based on family diversity, gender stereotypes, and the harmful effects of bullying could be the stepping stones. By addressing issues at this stage about language and actions that are hurtful, schools will become a more welcoming place.

It would also evade the escalation of bias and bullying that continues in middle and high school. But the only way to address the issue of heteronormativity is by orienting the teacher education programmes towards a compassionate, critical and justice-oriented curriculum.

32,2020/02/02,Salute to a beloved teacher,"In June 1965, I was a seventh standard student of King George’s School, Belgaum (now Military School, Belagavi). Straight from a village in Haryana, with little knowledge of English, here I was just about 13 years old among children from all walks of life. Initially, I was lost and cried often, feeling out of place. But, soon, I was on my feet and rubbing shoulders with children from privileged backgrounds. All this, thanks to our visionary Principal, R.S. Mani.

Seeing my shyness and poor English, he called me to his office.

Handing me a copy of Reader’s Digest with an essay on Gandhiji, he said, “Ripu, next week you will narrate that essay in the Assembly.” “Nothing is impossible,” he added.

I took it as a challenge and decided to memorise the whole essay. Shivering, I stood in front of the assembly, and rattled out the essay like a parrot. Loud clapping ensued.

Here began the story of how a teacher can mould and build a student. Principal Mani asked me to read newspapers daily and make note of important events. I took a dictionary and sat with an English daily. In one hour, I could finish no more than half a page, but I did not lose heart. The output kept increasing every day. My vocabulary kept on expanding, so did the general awareness.

Mr. Mani put me in the declamation team. By the time I was in the 10th standard, I was the best debater of the school. I still remember how we defeated a Pune school in an inter-school debate which was presided over by none other than Nani Palkhiwala. “Why don’t you start writing when you can speak so well,” Mr. Mani asked. And there I was in the school magazine editorial team.

He reposed faith in me as a moral guide, and put me in charge of the small children in Pratap House. It enriched me spiritually as I had to lead young minds on the righteous path.

No wonder, even today at 66, when I get on my bicycle, I remember him and pedal on to do my bit for the under-privileged.

33,2020/02/02,"No ping, no zing: what have holidays come to!","Ah, the holidays! Count yourself lucky if the word conjures up images of exotic landscapes and magical moments. For, that is not always the case with everyone.

My family isn’t really enthusiastic about holidays. I am usually the only one gung-ho about it.

“No leave,” is the first response from my workaholic husband and it takes some pleading, prodding and good food to make him comply. The children are of no help either.

“Why do we have to go on a holiday? Can’t we just stay at home, watch TV, order food and chill,” asks the elder one.

“Everyone needs to take a break from everyday stress,” I try to reason with him, staying clear of my family bonding idea lest it scares the GenerationZ man.

So finally, I set off to a faraway beach resort with a reluctant family in tow. Midway, the husband becomes active and alert. “Did you lock the back door,” he asks. “I did.”

“What about the gas stove? Did you shut it off,” he continues. “Yes.”

But my mind went back to the morning — the hurried cooking, the eating and then the shouting and screaming that the taxi had arrived. Did I forget to switch off the stove?

“Looks like mom is already homesick. This is why I said we should just chill at home,” my son looks up from his phone.

“Put your phones away. We are on a holiday,” I tell him.

At the resort the next morning, I am awakened by highly agitated chatter and find my family sitting huddled together, crestfallen, as though there had been some calamity.

“What happened? Did the stove explode? Is everything okay,” I babble.

“Mom, there’s no Wi-Fi or mobile phone signal here,” my daughter says looking distraught. “How are we supposed to enjoy the holidays now?”

“This is terrible,” my husband adds. “How am I going to make any calls now?”

“That’s it,” I breathe a sigh of relief. No mobiles. No distractions.

But all my hopes for a bonding holiday go for a toss, with the husband constantly worrying about the missed calls and the children complaining about boredom.

After two dreadfully long days, I decide enough is enough and put forward a plan to cut short our holiday and return home. There is a new spirit of camaraderie in the air as we journey home — the kind often felt by people who had been through tough times together.

34,2020/02/02,The chromosome caper,"The human foetus is the most demanding compared with those of other mammals. As a consequence, it has the most complex and invasive placenta, burrowing deep into the wall of the uterus asking for more. The mother has no choice but to oblige.

In a hospital outpatient department in Kerala, as patients’ names are called, I have noted a common suffix to the names of many women. Most of those above 60 years of age have it: Amma, meaning mother. Devakiamma, Kamalamma, Radhamma; their maiden name, I am sure, did not carry that suffix. At some point of their life, Devaki, Kamala and Radha transformed to Ammas. You have guessed it right, it happened after childbirth.

Childbirth brings about a lot of anatomical, physiological and psychological changes to a woman; almost all physiological changes normalise, many anatomical changes revert, but psychological changes don’t. The name too sticks.

Long travel

In a study published in the Journal of Molecular Human Reproduction recently, researchers looked for the presence of the Y chromosome (the ‘male’ chromosome) by a sensitive technique called in situ hybridisation in women who died with a male foetus during late pregnancy or immediately after delivery. They found that the Y chromosome in the foetus had travelled to the mother, not just in the blood but also into most major organs such as brain, lungs, kidneys, liver and spleen. They were present in 100% autopsy samples from the brain, spleen and lungs, 95% from the liver and 29% from the heart.

A chimera

Another ground-breaking finding in 2012 was detection by autopsy of the Y chromosome in the brain of 63% of the mothers long after delivery. The oldest woman studied was 94 years old. The Y chromosome had no business to be there, except that all these women had mothered at least one male child.

A normal human being carries a single line of DNA. Rarely do people carry two lines, called “chimerism”, named after the part-lion, part-goat fire-breathing mythological monster.

Scientists have created “chimeric” lab animals, but “chimerism” is known to occur in humans either by birth (dizygotic twins, one of which gets merged to the other) or after organ transplant (bone marrow transplant).

The long-term effects of such a rare phenomenon are unknown.

While true “chimerism” is rare, “micro-chimerism”, seen after pregnancy and delivery, is probably not that uncommon. All that we can say is that the apparently helpless foetus, nurtured deep down in the mother’s womb, tends to hijack the maternal system in ways which is much beyond our understanding.

There are scientists who believe that “micro-chimerism” leads to changes in the hormonal status of women after pregnancy, and perhaps protects the mother from diseases such as cancer and heart disease, improving maternal survival for the baby’s benefit — not just in the short term but in the years to come.

I always thought, but never had the courage to profess, that my wife loves and cares for our children more than I do. Now I think I know why.

35,2020/02/02,Why Justice is delayed,"The recent rape and murder of a young veterinary doctor in Hyderabad has yet again raised concern over women’s safety in the country. As the four accused were shot dead a few days after the incident, the debate shifted to whether such instant justice without trial is acceptable or not in a civilised society.

Nearly 60 lakh criminal cases have been pending for more than five years in the country, and hence a fresh look at the laws is essential to render justice to victims without delay and protect the rights of the accused. Reforms are required for the police, the forensics wing, the prosecution, the courts and the laws.

Role of the police

It is the police who set the criminal justice system into motion by initiating an investigation. A police officer handling law-and-order duties may not be able to pay adequate attention to that specialised field.

Hence, law and order and investigation duties must be separated, which the Supreme Court has recommended in its order on police reforms. Though practical difficulties come in the way of its full implementation, a specialised unit can be started in every district to investigate crimes of a grave nature such as murder and rape.

Often, the police delay filing of chargesheets. Sometimes, chargesheets are returned for rectification. Forensic reports too are delayed as just a few forensic labs exist. More labs should be opened with capabilities for cyberforensics, DNA testing, handwriting comparison and so on. Every district should have one.

Even after the chargesheet is submitted in the court, there is considerable delay in taking the cases on file and committing them to the court. Special courts exclusively for trial of heinous offences such as murder and dacoity must be set up with powers to take cognisance of offences directly and conduct trial on a day-to-day basis.

Many provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.PC) enable the accused to delay trial. Such provisions intended to provide every opportunity to the accused to defend themselves are often used to delay and scuttle trial. Once the court takes cognisance of a case, it should be the bounden duty of the accused to appear for the trial. The accused should be put to jeopardy if they try to abscond.

The accused adopt many delaying tactics — absenting themselves one after the other without receiving copies of documents relied upon by the prosecution; failing to appear to give explanation for the charges; and filing discharge petitions one after the other and later going on appeal.

When the trial finally starts, the witnesses are first examined but the defence counsel defers cross-examination. They are later recalled one by one for cross-examination. The accused then seek repeated adjournments by filing petitions under Section 317 of the Cr.PC.

Examination of witnesses, questioning of the accused and so on too are deferred.

Another method is to abscond and remain untraceable for a long time. Warrants are then issued against the accused.

If one absconding accused is secured and produced before the court, the co-accused will abscond one by one.

After closure of prosecution, the defence counsel invariably represent that they propose to examine the defence witnesses. But after many adjournments, they will say there are no such witnesses. Likewise, the oral arguments are delayed by giving excuses such as personal inconvenience of counsel.

Amendments to the law

To overcome these problems, the following amendments in the Cr.PC need to be carried out.

Section 207 may be amended to furnish copies to counsel when the accused is absent. Sections 228 and 240 may be amended to get explanation from counsel on the charges framed in case the accused is absent.

Under Sections 227 and 239, a time limit of 30 days from the date of receipt of copies may be set for filing discharge petition.

Section 317 may be amended to enable the court to examine witnesses in the absence of the accused and their counsel.

In the revisional powers under Section 397 and inherent powers under Section 482, necessary provisions may be inserted so that the other party is heard before passing interim orders on the investigation and prosecution.

The bail provisions under Sections 436 and 437 may be amended so that the accused who violate bail conditions can be detained till the completion of the trial.

Provisions may be included in the bail bond to obtain the consent of the accused to conduct the trial in his absence in case of breach of conditions.

Some of the frequently reported offences under Sections 294(b) 147, 148, 279, 324, 384 and 498A of the Indian Penal Code which are not very serious in nature can be brought under compoundable offences.

In addition, the number of appeals should be capped, and the court must extensively use videoconferencing to examine witnesses.

39,2020/02/02,"Sofia Kenin's father Alex — zero to hero, literally!","It wasn't so long ago that Sofia Kenin's father was driving New York taxis. He spoke English so poorly he didn't know where he was supposed to be going.

These days, however, Alex Kenin, despite starting with close to zero tennis knowledge, is coaching a Grand Slam champion.

Crazy-smart

Russia-born Alex, an unassuming, grey-haired man with a receding hairline, introduced Sofia to tennis, brought her up around the game and pushed her to achieve the extraordinary — crowned by her victory at the Australian Open on Saturday.

Sofia said her “crazy-smart” father had no prior experience of the game, but simply picked it up by observing those around him.

“He's seen how all the other coaches have been coaching their players, but he knows everything,” Sofia said, after stunning Garbine Muguruza in her first Grand Slam final. “He knows what he's talking about, he really knows it and he comes up with the right plans, the right strategies.”

If Sofia's achievement is remarkable, it owes a great deal to her father, who was ever-present courtside during her increasingly impressive run through the Melbourne women's draw.

Teenage prodigy Coco Gauff, world number one Ashleigh Barty and, in the final, two-time Major-winner Muguruza all fell victim to tough-as-boots Sofia, who was following strategies drawn up by her wily father.

He joins a long list of tennis dads who have produced champions, including Richard Williams, father of Venus and Serena, Mike Agassi (Andre) and Yuri Sharapova (Maria).

But unlike some other fathers, whose influence has been resented or even negative, Alex and Sofia, 21, remain close and affectionate.

Alex arrived in New York from what was then the Soviet Union in 1987 with his wife, Lena, and a few hundred dollars in his pocket, searching for the ‘American Dream’.

He drove a taxi by night and went to English and computer school during the day, a period he describes as “very, very tough”.

“I had to work at night, go to school in the morning. Driving in New York, speaking English on the (taxi) radio. I had no idea what they were saying,” he said. “But it's amazing the things you do to survive. (Sofia) knows about that and I think it made her tough.”

Talent

Sofia clearly had talent from a young age, but they remained outsiders and making it on the tennis circuit was never easy.

“People overlooked me. I wasn't the tallest kid when I was little. People said, 'What are you talking about? She's so small. What are you doing? This is a joke,'” Sofia said.

“We didn't have the best things said about me but my dad's been there and he believed in me, didn't listen to that. He could have easily said, okay, and I could have done something (else).”

Sofia represented America at the 2014 Youth Olympics, made her Grand Slam debut as a wild-card at the 2015 US Open and broke into the top 100 in March 2018.

Her career really took off last year, when she won three singles titles and rose to a world ranking of 12. But despite her recent success, nobody predicted her victory in Melbourne.

Tough cookie

During Saturday's final, Alex could barely watch as Sofia closed on the win, and he filmed her winner's speech — which was beamed live worldwide — on his mobile phone.

“He was so happy. I was so happy. We shared this together. He was like, 'What just happened?'” Sofia said. “I'm also just on cloud nine. He's just proud of me. I'm a tough cookie, but I did it.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/j3rwm7/article30720763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03ALEX,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-women-champion-sofia-kenins-father-alex-zero-to-hero-literally/article30720764.ece

41,2020/02/02,Australian Open | Djokovic beats Thiem to win record-extending eighth title,"Novak Djokovic endured a fierce challenge to his Melbourne Park reign before overhauling Dominic Thiem 6-4 4-6 2-6 6-3 6-4 on Sunday to clinch an eighth Australian Open crown and reclaim the world number one ranking.

While Rafa Nadal rules Roland Garros with 12 titles, Djokovic holds sway in the title match at Rod Laver Arena having never lost a final in Melbourne Park. Yet on Sunday the Serb was under siege for much of the thriller.

For the first time in eight Melbourne finals, Djokovic was forced to come back when trailing after three sets, rocked by the power and determination of Thiem.

But as he so often does, the Serb found a way.

He captured the decisive break in the third game of the final set, then held firm as Thiem made desperate assaults on his serve.

Going for broke in a nerve-shredding final game, the fifth seeded Austrian went for the lines but missed on the first championship point to hand Djokovic one of his most hard-earnt triumphs.

“This is definitely my favourite court, my favourite stadium in the world and I am blessed to hold this trophy again,” said Djokovic after being presented with the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup by 2005 winner Marat Safin.

Four months after Nadal stopped Russian Daniil Medvedev in the U.S. Open final, the Serb's 17th Grand Slam title continued the 'Big Three's' reign over the majors.

Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer have now won 13 Grand Slam titles in succession, dating back to Federer's 2017 win at Melbourne Park.

Thiem, seen as one of the greatest hopes to end the Big Three domination, was consigned to his third defeat in a major final following losses in the last two French Open deciders to Nadal.

“Unreal what you are doing through all these years. You and two other guys have brought men's tennis to a completely new level,” the 26-year-old told Djokovic at the trophy ceremony.

“Well I fell a little bit short but I hope I can get revenge soon.”

While Thiem started heavy-legged after spending a total of eight hours beating Alexander Zverev and Nadal in his previous two matches, Djokovic charged out of the blocks to take the first set.

But the match turned on its head at 4-4 in the second when Djokovic became flustered after being called twice for breaching the service clock.

He returned to his chair fuming and paused to sarcastically pat chair umpire Damien Dumusois's sneaker, telling the Frenchman: “Great job man, you made yourself famous in this match, especially for the second one. Well done.”

Conceding the set with a terrible backhand, a shellshocked Djokovic lost six games in a row as Thiem, blasting winners virtually at will, roared to a 4-0 lead in the third.

Something was amiss with the Serb and he called for the trainer after holding serve. But he underwent no treatment and resumed after an exchange of words.

He made a fist of digging in, saving three set points but a wayward forehand on the fourth gave Thiem the lead.

It looked gloomy for Djokovic, who had destroyed Nadal in three sets in the 2019 final.

But the match turned again when Thiem gave up a double-fault to concede two break points, then blasted a forehand long to fall 5-3 behind in the fourth set.

In a flash, Djokovic had served out the set to love, sealing it with an ace.

Having spent about six hours more time on court than Djokovic through the tournament, the strain of a long campaign began to tell on Thiem but he refused to crumble in the fifth.

He had two chances to break back in the fourth game but Djokovic nervelessly cancelled the threat before holding firm in the nerve-jangling finish.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/vks897/article30719614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DJOKOVIC-KESAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-2020-tennis-championship-mens-final-between-novak-djokovic-vs-dominic-thiem/article30719615.ece

The hometown pair had a wonderful run at Melbourne Park, but it came to a screeching halt against the 11th seeds, who strolled to a 6-4 6-2 victory in 70 minutes on a balmy afternoon at the Rod Laver Arena.

Such was the domination of Salisbury and Ram, who won the Australian Open mixed doubles title with Czech Barbora Krejcikova last year, that they did not face a single break point in the match.

44,2020/02/02,Only one top-50 player for Tata Open,"The last time India’s only ATP 250 event didn’t boast of a player from the World’s top-10 was way back in 2003 at the erstwhile Chennai Open when the then World No.15 Guillermo Canas was the top seed.

When the Tata Open Maharashtra gets underway on Monday, it will have only one top-50 player in its ranks, World No. 21 Benoit Paire.

The tournament has been hit hard by the scheduling of the inaugural ATP Cup.

Coveted slot

The coveted start-of-the-season slot ahead of the Australian Open, which was earlier Pune’s (and Brisbane’s and Doha’s) is now the ATP Cup’s.

Brisbane was compensated for the loss of its event by being one of the venues for the ATP Cup. And such is Doha’s monetary heft (a financial commitment of $1,465,260 against Pune’s $610,010) that even when run alongside the ATP Cup it could attract two players in top-20 (Stan Wawrinka and Andrey Rublev).

But Pune has had to push its dates to a window that is sandwiched between the Aussie Open and the hard court swings in Europe and the Americas, and thus settle for a less spectacular field.

“Players have been in Australia for a month under tough circumstances and probably want to go back home,” said Sunder Iyer, Hon. Secretary of the Maharashtra State Lawn Tennis Association, the host organisation.

“The circuit now moves to Europe and it is much easier to start playing there. We were offered one slot later [September] but that would have been tough. Or we had to compete with Doha which has much higher prize money.”

The competition that will run concurrently with Pune now, the ATP 250 in Montepellier, France, has also hurt. Though comparable in terms of financial outlay ($672,700 to Pune’s $610,010), its proximity to the ATP 500 in Rotterdam, the next big event in the calendar, has seen four of the World’s top-20 flock to the event.

“We called all the players, but everyone said that they preferred going to Europe,” said Tata Open tournament director Prashant Sutar.

“Especially those who lost in the first or second rounds in Australia; they won't go home to Europe and then come back to India. We will be raising this issue (with ATP) strongly and that Asian tennis needs to be revamped.”

Refutes claims

But Sutar refuted claims that with less star appeal the tournament would become financially unviable. “The idea of this tournament is the projection of Indians and Asians,” he said.

“So there’s been no problem with sponsors. There are five Indians in the [singles] main draw. Hopefully we can get a champion too.”

It was a view that India’s top singles player Prajnesh Gunneswaran concurred with. “It is a standalone tournament because it is not before Australia, but it is good for the Indians,” he said.

“With me and Sumit [Nagal] getting in directly, there’s opportunity for two other Indians. That’s not something which happens regularly. Hopefully all of us will go up a few rounds and get some points that can give us a springboard.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/nscxn7/article30716588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02PUNE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/only-one-top-50-player-for-tata-open/article30716589.ece
45,2020/02/02,Tata Open Maharashtra | Benoit Paire gets a relatively easy group,"Benoit Paire sits atop what seems the lighter of the halves after the draw ceremony of the Tata Open Maharashtra here on Saturday. The World No. 21, who is making his eighth tournament appearance and is a two-time semifinalist (2017 & 2018), has the rising South Korean and tournament’s fourth seed Soonwoo Kwon (No. 87) for company.

The presence of two qualifiers in Paire’s quarter will make it interesting, for the qualifying draw boasts of names such as Serbian Viktor Troicki and Czech Lukas Rosol. Also in this set of eight is Indian wild card Sasi Kumar Mukund, who will open against Japan’s Taro Daniel. The highest-ranked Indian, Prajnesh Gunneswaran (No. 123), is also in the top half, and will meet Kwon if he can get past Germany’s Yannick Maden.

Bottom half

Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis (No. 69) headlines the bottom half and is likely to clash with 2019 finalist Ivo Karlovic (No. 124). Sumit Nagal (No. 131) meets a qualifier and if he gets through, will face either Thomas Fabbiano or Yuichi Sugita.

World No. 74 Stefano Travaglia is seeded fourth and it is in the Italian’s quarter that two other Indian wild cards, Ramkumar Ramananthan and Arjun Kadhe, find themselves in.

The home duo can meet each other in the second round, but have to first tackle seventh seeded Italian Salvatore Caruso and the seasoned Czech Jiri Vesely respectively.

This being a field of 28, Paire, Kwon, Travaglia and Berankis all received byes into the second round.

The 16-team doubles event will see two all-Indian pairs, but defending champions Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan will be playing with different partners.

While Rohan has teamed up with Kadhe, Divij is the tournament’s second seed alongside Kiwi Artem Sitak and will take on the Leander Paes-Matthew Ebden combine which was handed a wild card on Saturday.

Meanwhile the lone Indian in qualifying, Saketh Myneni was beaten 6-3, 6-2 by Serb Nikola Milojevic.

Qualifying results (first round): Matthew Ebden (Aus) bt Zhizhen Zhang (Chn) 6-3, 6-2; Blaz Rola (Slo) bt Malek Jaziri (Tun) 6-7 (5), 7-6 (6), 7-6 (2).

Roberto Marcora (Ita) bt Filippo Baldi (Ita) 6-3, 6-2; Robin Haase (Ned) bt Frederico Ferreira Silva (Por) 3-6, 7-6 (5), 6-4.

46,2020/02/02,Five injured in ceiling collapse in Mumbai’s Andheri,"Five persons, including a woman and her two minor children, were injured when the ceiling of a flat collapsed on them in suburban Andheri on February 2 morning, police said.

The incident occurred at around 11 a.m. in Vishal Housing Society in Cama Park locality of the western suburb, an official said.

“Naziya Feeroz Sheikh and her two children Rehan (2) and Azan (4) were sitting in her brother’s 7th floor flat when the ceiling came off, injuring all of them. Naziya’s brother Rashid and another person Sadik received minor injuries,” he said.

47,2020/02/02,Funds for clean air a welcome step,"An estimated 1.2 million Indians are killed due to poor air quality, a growing health crisis over the years. Clean air has thus become a matter of concern. On Saturday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman tapped the concern rightly by allocating ₹4,400 crore for improving the air quality.

“In large cities with a population above one million, clean air is a matter of concern. The government proposes to encourage such States that are formulating and implementing plans for ensuring cleaner air in cities above one million. Parameters for the incentives would be notified by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate change. Allocation for this purpose is ₹4,400 crore for 2020-21,” she said in her speech.

According to Dr. Sneha Limaye, a physician and air pollution scientist who heads the department of clinical research at the Chest Research Foundation in Pune, India’s air pollution levels have reached an explosive limit. “If we don’t act today, we are not leaving anything good for the next generation to come,” said Dr. Limaye adding that the Budget allocation is a sign that the government had taken cognizance of the problem and it is a welcome step. “Babies in the womb are getting exposed to the toxic air that the mothers are breathing. It is a health hazard and poor air quality will soon become the number one killer. We have to act fast,” she said.

Recently, giant lungs made of high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter installed in Mumbai went black from chalk white in a matter of two weeks. In a similar experiment in Delhi, it took six days for the lungs to go black while in Bengaluru, it took 25 days. The rapid colour change showed how the human lungs are impacted every day as we breathe the toxic air continuously.

Studies have shown that poor lung health during childhood are a major risk factor for developing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorders later in life.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/95kbf5/article30716788.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BMMUMBAIPOLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/funds-for-clean-air-a-welcome-step/article30716789.ece
48,2020/02/02,"Filmmakers, actors discuss dissent and communalism","Vocal critics of the current government, filmmakers Saeed Akhtar Mirza, Anand Patwardhan, actors Sushant Singh, Swara Bhaskar, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub and theatre director and writer Rasika Agashe, spoke unabashedly about the “prevalent fear and hate politics” in the country, and called for “active participation in dissent”. The auditorium at YB Chavan Centre could barely contain the audience’s enthusiasm, as the floor was opened to the questions after the no-holds-barred conversation on ‘Artists against communalism’, which was part of the Mumbai Collective on Saturday.

Mr. Patwardhan said he submitted his documentary Reason, which examines the rise of Hindutva ideology in India, to Mumbai International Film Festival to “trouble the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, despite knowing that they would reject it”. The biennial film festival of non feature films is organised by the Films Division. “But in the process, we found out that they also rejected a few other films that discuss the relationship [between] and co-existence of Hindus and Muslims in India,” he said.

The panel discussed “the fear that looms over artists” who speak up against the current government. Mr. Singh said, “But one positive thing in all this is, look at how many A-listers were there in that infamous selfie with Narendra Modi, but there were no A-listers who attended the meeting with [Railways and Commerce Minister] Piyush Goyal, and that is also an act of resistance.”

According to Ms. Bhaskar, more than being apolitical, Bollywood is quick to react to problematic incidents shown in the news, like a scene of lynching in Baaghi 2. “So for popular culture to change, we need to change popular thinking,” she said.

Mr. Ayyub agreed with her, adding that “the act of resistance” must be “taken at every step”. After the attack on the students in Jamia in December last year, Mr. Ayyub had visited the campus in solidarity with the students. “For me it felt like an attack on my whole existence since that’s the area which I have seen for years growing up,” he said.

The “fight against fascism” for Ms. Agashe goes beyond voting the BJP out of power. “For me it involves confronting our families on WhatsApp groups, our neighbours who maybe bigoted, who are fed wrong stories over the years. As artists, it is upon us to tell them our stories, be it the story of Rohith Vemula or Gauri Lankesh,” she said.

The panel also discussed the need to discuss the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and the scrapping of Article 370 with those “outside the echo chamber”.

“The good thing about fascism is that it is unsustainable, and history has proven that,” said Mr. Patwardhan.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/k47cfz/article30716784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMMUMBAICOLLECTIVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/filmmakers-actors-discuss-dissent-and-communalism/article30716785.ece
49,2020/02/02,"Health allocations disappointing, say activists","Healthcare specialists and activists have termed the health allocations in Saturday’s Union Budget as extremely disappointing. A negligible increase in the overall health budget, lack of thought to preventive healthcare and move towards privatisation are some of the points that experts said were worrisome. The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a people’s health movement has called the Budget a mere “bubble of words”.

Activists said that ₹69,000 crore allocation for health is hardly any increase. For better public healthcare services, the government should have allocated at least ₹93,000 crore. “If you factor in the inflation, there is practically no increase in the allocation,” said health activist and researcher Ravi Duggal adding that the Budget is not at par with the idea of universal healthcare.

Ayushman Bharat

While there are about 20,000 empanelled hospitals on the government’s Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY), there is a need for hospitals in Tier 2 and 3 cities. Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday announced that hospitals will be set up through public private partnerships. But health experts fear this is a mere attempt to offer health care to private players. “Instead of utilising the available infrastructure and improving it, the government wants to set up new infrastructure on PPP models. How is that logical?” asked Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor of Jan Swasthya Abhiyan. “If you see the fine details, the government is simply offering its infrastructure on a platter to the private players,” he added.

According to Dr. Prince Surana, director of Surana Group of Hospitals, the government should have increased the allocation to Ayushman Bharat scheme so that the rate of reimbursements would have been better and more hospitals would participate in the scheme.

“With this, the patient’s out of pocket expenses would have been directly reduced,” said Dr. Surana.

Health activist Dr. Arun Gadre said that the government’s plans to upgrade wellness centres was seen as a positive step in preventive healthcare. “We were hoping that the allocations will improve in this Budget, but the government has chosen to completely ignore this aspect,” said Dr. Gadre.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/24qwrp/article30716774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMHealthcarecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/health-allocations-disappointing-say-activists/article30716775.ece
50,2020/02/02,‘RSS working on new aggressive brand of Hindutva’,"The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its ancillary arms are working on a new brand of Hindutva that is aggressive in nature, and there is an urgent need to counter it, said Pune University professor Swati Dyahadroy and Ambedkarite author Bhanwar Meghwanshi.

They were speaking at the session on ‘Cultural Politics of the RSS’ and its expanse in modern times at the Mumbai Collective on Saturday. The speakers said male and female identity within this new brand of Hindutva is antithetical to the idea of being submissive.

Ms. Dyahadroy said the Rashtra Sevika Samiti, the women’s wing of the RSS, is working on building India’s own aggressive feminist movement. She said, “The women of the samiti are being taught a new brand of Indian feminism and its practices that are to be applied on a daily basis. The idea of this feminism is rooted not in the liberation of women but stree shakti [power].”

Ms. Dyahadroy added that the male identity projected by the RSS has also become more masculine over the years. “Look at how they have been projecting lord Ram with just a bow and arrow in their literature. Earlier, we saw Ram in pictures with Sita or another female figure. That has completely stopped post the Babri [Masjid] demolition, when the RSS started promoting a new aggressive brand of Hindutva.”

Both Ms. Dyahadroy and Mr. Meghwanshi, who have worked in the cultural wing of the RSS, said the organisation’s ultimate aim is to be a spiritual adviser to the king, alluding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The idea of seva [service] is at the core of their philosophy. That is why Mr. Modi calls himself Pradhan Sevak and not Pradhan Mantri. Ultimately, it will not matter whether Mr. Modi or Amit Shah is the next Prime Minister of India. They will all go and surrender the crown at the feet of the RSS sarsanghchalak,” said Mr. Meghwanshi, who participated in the RSS’s first kar seva as a teenager in Rajasthan. He later got disillusioned with the RSS ideology and embraced Ambedkarite philosophy.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rss-working-on-new-aggressive-brand-of-hindutva/article30716769.ece
51,2020/02/02,"Like Gandhiji, we also will not cooperate, says Jitendra Awhad","State Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad on Saturday took on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah saying that their plan of targeting Assamese Muslims has failed.

Addressing a rally of over 5,000 people against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Thane, Mr. Awhad said, “They thought that they would pack off the Muslims in Assam by introducing the NRC, but it did not work when the Muslims were in small numbers. However, it has sparked a battle between the Assamese and the Bengalis who are blaming each other for the problems.”

The protest organised by Kul Jamat Tasleem saw people marching from Rabodi Naka to Central Maidan with the Tricolour and anti-CAA and anti-NRC banners being held up as patriotic songs from Bollywood films played in the background.

Making a reference to the two incidents of firing over the past two days at Jamia Milia Islamia in Delhi and Shaheen Bagh, Mr. Awhad said Nathuram Godse will try to kill Mahatma Gandhi but many more Gandhis will be born.

He said, “I have sent a message to Delhi to rename Shaheen Bagh as Kasturba Bagh as we all are the children of Mahatma Gandhi and Kasturba. Therefore, we will continue protesting in peace even if we have to get hit by lathis or bullets. Even if they throw stones at us, we will make a Taj Mahal out of it, but won’t opt to violence.”

‘Attack on lower castes’

Mr. Awhad said the CAA and NRC were not attacking Muslims but people of lower caste. “All the lower caste people are afraid of the Act, but we will not show them the documents when they come to our house for NRC or NPR. We have been uplifted by Babasaheb Ambedkar and we will not let them ruin the Constitution framed by him. We will not cooperate like Gandhiji refused to,” he said. He also recited his poem ‘Sun le’, which attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government for dividing people on the basis of religion.

B.G. Kolse Patil, retired Bombay High Court judge, also took on the Modi-Shah duo and called them goons. He said, “Both of them are the agents of RSS, an organisation which is the enemy of everyone, including Hindus. The BJP government could have led the country on a path of progress but they chose to destroy the country. They have destroyed the economy and the bureaucracy. Even the justice providers are forced by them to change their decisions.”

Calling upon people to fight the battle in Gandhi’s style, he said, “Both of them are robots, made to destroy the country. These robots are very powerful, but once these robots are punched down, they cannot fight back.”

Narsimh Tiwari, a Kashmiri pandit and president of Azad Nagar Ganesh Mandal, also attacked the Prime Minister. “If CAA is not taken back, Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah will be defeated like lord Ram defeated Ravana. They still have time to accept their mistake and call back the laws, the people of India will forgive them,” Mr. Tiwari said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/v68fe9/article30716763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMCAAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/like-gandhiji-we-also-will-not-cooperate-says-jitendra-awhad/article30716765.ece
52,2020/02/02,"Unfair to Mumbai, Maharashtra: Uddhav","Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Saturday that the Union Budget was “disconnected with the country’s economic reality” and was unjust towards Mumbai and Maharashtra as there are no provisions for the State. NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat also criticised the budget.

“The Budget merely peddles dreams to the youth, farmers and common man of this country. Decisions like selling stake of IDBI, LIC, and privatisation of Railways show the poor state of the economy while the decision to allow sale of government bonds to private individuals is worrying,” Mr. Thackeray said in a statement issued by the CMO.

Mr. Thackeray questioned the Centre’s decision to set GDP target at 10% while the Economic Survey has pegged the rate at 5% in the current year and 6 to 6.5% in 2020-21. Calling it the lowest rate in the last few years, he said it will not achieve Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s dream to make India a $5 trillion economy.

“That is why, large-scale investment in basic infrastructure is required but the provisions are meagre… GST has actually hurt micro, small and medium enterprises as purchasing power has reduced and there is no demand. The Budget should have given impetus to employment-centric industries but has not. In 2030, India will have the largest youth population in the world but the budget did not show any clear way to provide for their employment. When will farmers actually double their income? The outlay for agriculture is only slightly higher from last year. The Budget provisions are not at par with what is envisaged in the Budget,” the statement said.

Calling Mumbai the country’s growth engine, Mr. Thackeray said that the Budget has been completely unfair to the State.

“The Budget did not give the necessary financial support to the Metro, railway projects, infrastructure development of Maharashtra that was required. Apart from two existing projects, the Budget did not provide for any new projects. Even while selecting five archaeological sites, the Centre has ignored a culturally rich State like Maharashtra, their bias is clear in the budget. While the International Finance Centre in Gujarat has been given impetus, Mumbai has been completely neglected,” he said in his statement.

NCP chairman Sharad Pawar tweeted, “Budget focuses on Agriculture Warehousing but lacks vision and clarity on Doubling Farmers’ income. It is still a distant dream. Automobile sector has been completely ignored and unemployment issue is not addressed fairly. It was the lengthiest speech but lacked farsightedness and direction.”

NCP leader and Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil also criticised the Budget for not giving anything to Maharashtra.

Maharashtra Congress chief and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat tweeted, “Modi government continues with its false promises. With the agriculture growth falling to 2% due to poor policies by the government, how are they going to double the farmers income by 2022. Where is Maharahstra in #Budget2020? Mumbai and Maharashtra that gives the Centre largest share of taxes has been left disappointed by the Modi government. Is Maharashtra less important for the government?”

Former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis called the Budget progressive. “There are large-scale provisions for agriculture sector, the 16-point program will increase production, fill gaps in transportation, linkage and addresses challenges of farm sector. The Budget has made a provision for ₹103 lakh crore for infrastructure investment, including 100 airports, medical facilities in every district, railway projects that will also increase job opportunities. Besides, middle class has got relief through income tax slabs.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/noxhh4/article30716751.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/unfair-to-mumbai-maharashtra-uddhav/article30716752.ece
53,2020/02/02,"NRC, NPR will create huge chaos, say lawyers, activists","The National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) took the centre stage at the annual Mumbai Collective – Celebrating Freedom and Pluralism – event at YB Chavan Centre in Nariman Point on Saturday with lawyers and activists saying the move by the Central government will create a huge chaos, and that it should be opposed.

Senior advocate Mihir Desai, renowned civil rights lawyer and one who has represented many who have fought for their fundamental rights at the Bombay High Court and the apex court, said, “The NRC and NPR are going to lead to huge chaos and therefore we must oppose it now. Even if tomorrow, the Supreme Court of India upholds the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the NRC and others as being constitutional we should still be out on the streets protesting against them because the custodian of this Constitution is not the SC, but the people of India. We should never give that up.”

‘Against marginalised’

He said, even if there is no CAA, you have NRC and NPR which are still dangerous not because of demarcating Muslims but because the government will act against marginalised people throughout the country. The combination of poor people, women, Dalits, Adivasis with CAA makes it even more lethal.

“That’s why we are opposing all three,” he said and added, “Boycott is a very good method of protest, but it has to be a mass boycott otherwise you will have people being targeted.” He said if 10 out of one lakh people boycott, they will be targeted. Speaking at a session titled ‘Hum Kaagaz Nahin Dikhayenge’, he said, “The boycott has to be mass, and if it is not then we have to rethink our strategies.”

Sangeeta Barooah Pisharoty, Deputy Editor, The Wire, who hails from Assam, spoke of NRC and the agitation there. She said it is a fight for identity and added, “Everybody is xenophobic. It’s very important to see why they are and what is the role of it in perpetuity.”

Vickram Crishna, an activist for privacy and protection, spoke on ‘Democracy Offline? On Internet Shutdowns’ and questioned why technology in India is supporting the oppressive and regressive regime in our country.

54,2020/02/02,"Despite differences, CAA protest in Mumbai continues","Confusion reigned for a few hours on Saturday at the site of the anti-CAA protest in Agripada, now known as Mumbai Bagh, after one faction tried to call it off but others insisted on staying put. By Saturday night, however, the protest grew in numbers again, as women flocked to the scene.

The protest, which began on the night of January 26, has been carried forward mainly by women, who have been taking turns.

Reports of the protest being called off started doing the rounds on social media around 5 p.m. on Saturday. Within half an hour, however, there were messages denying this and saying only some people had stepped away. “There are multiple people involved and while some of them said they want to call it off, others did not agree. We have deployed bandobast in the area and are monitoring the situation closely,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone III) Abhinash Kumar said.

Protesters told The Hindu that disagreements cropped up after political parties increased their participation. The protesters expressed discomfort at a picture of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray being put up at the protest site. The picture is accompanied by a caption saying, Ek nazar idhar bhi (Please turn your attention on us as well), which seems to be a direct political attack.

“The protest was supposed to be against the CAA and the NRC. Making a direct hit at an individual hijacks the essence of the protest. Many of us were uncomfortable with this,” said one of the protesters, who has been participating every day.

The “calling off” of the protest seems to be an outcome of these differences. Nationalist Congress Party member Naseem Siddiqui, who is among the convenors, said the call to stop the protest was given out by Furqan Sayyed, a local party worker of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen.

“Mr. Sayyed is part of the youth committee and was with us when we met the local police to discuss the situation. In front of everyone, he said he would go along with whatever my decision was. On Saturday, even as we were having a meeting with Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, we received word that Mr. Sayyed was asking everyone to call off the protest. He has not taken anyone’s calls since then, including his own party members,” Mr. Siddiqui said.

AIMIM spokesperson Waris Pathan was unavailable for the comment.

Asked about Mr Thackeray’s picture at the protest site, Mr Siddiqui said that it was only as a gesture of thanks for the State government’s stand on the CAA and the NRC.

Asma Khan, who said she has been here from the beginning, “There were rumours of a lathi charge. Some women got scared considering the firing at Shaheen Bagh, which in turn led to reports that the protest had been called off. This is when the police intervened and tried to move us.” An officer with the Nagpada police who was at the spot, however said there was no attempt to disperse the protesters.

“We have been getting reports of residents being disturbed due to the sloganeering at night. We rushed to the spot fearing that the situation had escalated.”

Kumar Attarwala, a resident of the Fatima building, however said, “Two days ago we had requested them to reduce sloganeering at night as it was disturbing those who were sleeping or studying, and they did so. In any case, this road has been blocked for six months for repairs. Now, when women are raising their voice for a good reason, why would we have a problem?”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/obnu71/article30716727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMMUMBAIBAGHPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/despite-differences-caa-protest-in-mumbai-continues/article30716728.ece
55,2020/02/02,‘Question system that gave rise to godmen in India’,"Journalist and author Ushinor Majumdar on Saturday highlighted the need to question the system that allowed people to acquire a godman-like status, and the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government’s role in the rise of self-proclaimed godmen.

At a session at the Mumbai Collective titled ‘Godmen and Hindutva’s Public Sphere’, Mr. Majumdar said, “You can blame the BJP and the RSS for legitimising godmen. But how far is that true? They may have scaled them up in a manner never before seen, but you need to look at the role of the Congress, the UPA government.”

Mr. Majumdar termed godmen petty and through a series of anecdotes on Asaram Bapu, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and Baba Rampal, he gave insights into how godmen operated and why people were drawn to them. “One of the reasons I could understand is that this was a two-way communication. Normally, when you go to a temple or a mosque, you speak but you can’t hear anything. But if you go to a godman, here is a man you can touch, feel, hear. But of course the difficulty is when they start trying to feel you,” he said before going on to discuss the sexual assault cases against Asaram Bapu.

Mr. Majumdar said it was easy to criticise the government of the day, which did not meet the ideals of people, but people should not forget what the previous governments have done. ‘He said, “We are trying to defend the Indian Constitution. How about upholding it? During the UPA term, did you see any changes to the defamation laws. No. Because they want to use it when it suits them.” Mr. Majumdar also questioned the Kerala government’s stand in investigating the allegations against Bishop Franco Mulakkal, who has been accused of raping a nun.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/question-system-that-gave-rise-to-godmen-in-india/article30716724.ece
56,2020/02/02,"If you don’t protest now, you might not get a chance later: Aishe Ghosh","People should not wait for students to die before deciding to raise their voices, said Aishe Ghosh, president of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Students’ Union, at the Mumbai Collective on Saturday. Ms. Ghosh said the time to wait was over and if people do not raise their voice now, there may not be a platform to dissent in future.

Highlighting the deaths of Rohith Vemula, scholar at the University of Hyderabad, and Fatima Latif, IIT Madras student, Ms. Ghosh said, “Why do we have to wait for a student to die, commit suicide, be killed, or Aishe Ghosh to be hit by an iron rod? This is not just a fight of students,” she said.

Ms. Ghosh, who was brutally attacked by goons on JNU campus on January 5, was a part of a panel of student leaders from Jamia Milia Islamia (JMI), Tata Institute Of Social Sciences (TISS), Hyderabad Central University (HCU) and Pondicherry University, who have been at the forefront of agitations across campuses in the country.

Ms. Ghosh said, “A good student is not someone who gets 99 on 100. A student is not someone who just reads about Hitler. Education and being a good student is to see similarities and stop it from happening in India. If we are learning about democracy in civics, then we need to implement it in society.”

Afra Abubakar from JMI said they had started door-to-door awareness campaigns after the Citizenship Amendment Act was enacted, but the attack on Jamia students on January 15 spread awareness more effectively about the fascist nature of the government. “With the shooting, more people will become aware,” she said.

‘A special place in history’

Ms. Ghosh said when history is written, it will have a place for all the women from Shaheen Bagh and across the country who are leading protests. Ms. Abubakar said, “The protests are still going strong due to the support we got from the neighbourhood.” She said if the protest at Shaheen Bagh has to survive, the protests in the other parts of the country need to have the same intensity and not be limited to symbolic protests.

Ms. Abubakar said, “At JNU, Jamia and Aligarh Muslim University, it was a protest. When people at Shaheen Bagh joined, it became a movement,” she said, adding that they had never dreamed that someone would attack the protest wielding a gun.

57,2020/02/02,nCoV: 10 of 12 quarantined discharged,"Ten out of the 12 quarantined patients suspected for exposure to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) in the State were discharged on Saturday. Only two patients — both foreign nationals — remained admitted at the Mumbai’s Kasturba Hospital as health officials awaited the reports of their samples.

State health officials said three out of the five patients quarantined in Mumbai, all five patients in Pune, and one each in Nanded and Nagpur were discharged after their two consecutive samples were negative. These patients have been asked to stay at home for the next few days and will be followed up over the phone. The two remaining Mumbai patients are likely to be discharged on Sunday.

While the samples are currently being sent to National Institute of Virology in Pune, the laboratory in Kasturba Hospital will also be equipped to carry out tests soon.

Meanwhile, State officials said 26 people from the first group of Indians who were evacuated from Wuhan are from Maharashtra. “They will be allowed to travel to the State only after 14 days,” said an official.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ncov-10-of-12-quarantined-discharged/article30716652.ece
58,2020/02/02,Quadruple murder accused under police scanner again,"Uday Pathak, the main accused in the infamous Kurar quadruple murders of 2011, is in the news again, after a masked man fired a gunshot at a medical store and left a paper chit with his name on it before fleeing on Saturday.

According to the police, the incident occurred around 1.30 p.m. in Kurar, where Pathak grew up and had been trying to establish his supremacy for years before his arrest. Officers said the assailant approached Anand Medical Store on foot and fired a handgun at it.

“The round shattered the window glass, and some shards injured a staffer at the store. The assailant dropped a paper chit on the ground and fled amidst the ensuing chaos. The chit was later found to have the words ‘Uday Pathak gang’ on it,” senior police inspector Babasaheb Salunkhe, Kurar police station, said.

He said CCTV camera footage is being examined to track the assailants movements and a case of attempt to murder has been registered under the Indian Penal Code, along with sections of the Arms Act. “We will be naming Pathak as an accused in the case,” Mr. Salunkhe said.

A local thug with a string of cases like assault and criminal intimidation to his name, Pathak hit the headlines in June 2011, when he and his gang members allegedly kidnapped four members of a rival gang, took them to the forest area in Kurar and subjected them to horrific torture through the night till they died. Their mutilated and partially burned bodies were found the next morning, sparking off terror and outrage throughout the locality.

Pathak had allegedly also facilitated a similar crime in 2015, and officials said these are attempts by him to keep the fear attached to his name alive. He had also attacked one of his co-accused in the quadruple murders at the sessions court after the latter turned approver.

“Every time Pathak feels his terror is decreasing he commits such crimes to send out a message. It is easy to pass on instructions to gang members during court appearances and smuggling of cell phones inside prisons is also not unheard of,” an officer said.

The police will be informing the authorities at the Arthur Road central jail, where Pathak is currently lodged, so they can find out if he has managed to smuggle a cell phone inside. Meanwhile, the Crime Branch has also been instructed to conduct parallel inquiries into the incident.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/quadruple-murder-accused-under-police-scanner-again/article30716616.ece
59,2020/02/02,Mumbai’s LGBTQIA+ community stages a colourful protest at Azad Maidan,"For the first time since 2008, Mumbai did not get to celebrate Pride with a march during the first weekend of February. Instead the community gathered to protest the denial of permissions at Azad Maidan on February 1 from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.

This year, the police denied permissions for political sloganeering. Instead Pride organisers, Queer Azaadi Mumbai (QAM), were suggested to hold the march at Azad Maidan. But the queer community couldn’t ignore the ongoing discourse on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). “The CAA and the NRC or any issue that affects anybody also affects queer people,” said Harish Iyer, equal rights activist and member of QAM.

Praful Baweja, a member of and Pride organiser at QAM, who is responsible along with others in securing necessary permissions for the Pride March said planning starts as early as September. On January 28, Baweja along with QAM members Tinesh Chopde and Saurabh Bondre were summoned to Gamdevi police station after a poster highlighting anti-CAA sentiments was spotted on social media. “We were shown a video of an impromptu protest at Nagpada where women sat without permissions,” said Baweja, adding that their personal documents like Aadhaar cards were scanned. “The police had intel that people would hijack the queer parade and talk about issues other than the ones affecting the community.”

From 3 p.m., hordes of people from the community and allies, including curious tourists and very amused bystanders began flocking the maidan. Approximately 3,000 people gathered in the dusty ground: several very colourfully dressed donning painted queer flags (trans, bi and gay) on their faces. In spite of the discomfort and the denial to celebrate Pride, members of the community stayed buoyant. On stage, Mr. Iyer called for unity, pride in self-expression and sexual orientation, reading out posters. such as one in Urdu, that said, “Mohabbat gunha nahi hai” (love is not a crime).

Amidst a sea of posters like ‘Jesus loves gays’ and ‘Free hugs’, several held banners condemning CAA. A special appeal was made to stay silent as a faction of people holding the Jai Bhim flag invited everyone to chant slogans of azaadi. ANAT, an all non-male theatre group, staged a street play likening fascists in power to rapists; while sex workers tried to erase the stigma of their work and call for unity.

A highlight was the arrival of a young queer gender-fluid person, Mx Ria Sharma, onstage with her parents who are members of Sweekar, a collective of supportive and accepting guardians of queer people. Mr. Sharma, Ria’s father, proudly declared, “Aap jaise bhi ho, ache ho, hamare bacche ho” (however you are, you are good and are our children).

60,2020/02/02,Water supply in western suburbs restored,"Residents of the city’s western suburbs may finally get relief from the water crisis they had been facing since a a water supply pipeline burst on Wednesday due to Metro 6 work at Jogeshwari Vikhroli Link Road (JVLR).

Late on Wednesday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) 1,800mm water supply pipeline burst during Metro work. As a result, the water department department had to shut the inlets and tunnel to conduct repairs and water supply was affected in the Bandra-Jogeshwari belt from Thursday morning. Soon, the BMC provided contact numbers of water tanker suppliers who would provide people water for free.

On Friday, the civic body declared that repairs would take another day and water would be shut off. While the BMC claimed that people living in affected areas — Bandra, Andheri, Jogeshwari, Kurla and Ghatkopar — were supplied water through 437 tanker trips, citizens said otherwise.

Several took to social media to express their disappointment as there was a shortage of water tankers.

Vinita Shah, a resident of Vile Parle East, tweeted, “There is no water supply since Thursday and we have been told that there are no tankers available either. Stores have even run out of bottled mineral water. My neighbour went to her in-laws’ place in Bandra because of this. For how long will stored water last?”

Citizens also shared pictures of long queues to fill water from common taps. A user @surabhi140 tweeted, “Can #News channels focus on water problem in #Mumbai and tell us when will Andheri, Vile Parle get water? Water tankers have run out of water and visiting cards. (sic)”

Another user @DinooMarino wrote, “Finally .... no one will be held accountable, the rate for one water tanker today is Rs 10,000. No one in the government or BMC is bothered, if this happened in a VIP area, the pipeline would have been fixed in hours. FYI shiv sena also runs the @mybmc #mumbai. (sic)”

Early in the day, the BMC had released a statement, saying that they were trying their best to restore water supply by midnight. “BMC’s seniormost officials are working on war footing to restore water supply,” it said.

Mumbai suburbs guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray, also assured residents. “In certain areas of Jogeshwari, Andheri E/ W, Parle, the water pipeline had been damaged. Leakage detected and work has begun. The expected water supply restoration time is around midnight tonight. Took an update from Mun Comm Pravin Pardeshi ji and our officers on ground (sic),” he tweeted.

After a challenging operation, which involved going through a 11-metre deep trench and drilling a manhole on the pipeline, the civic body finally detected the leak around afternoon. A 46-foot deep excavation had to be undertaken and landslide issues kept in mind. After the detection of the leak, it would take the BMC three hours to recharge the pipeline and five to six hours to fill the reservoir.

Announcing the breakthrough at 7.30 p.m., the BMC tweeted, “Good News! The pipeline restored & the manhole closed! Having completed the high pressure work, we are now ready to release very high pressure water through the pipe to fill the water in the reservoir!” After restoration, the work on filling reservoir will begin and on Sunday, people will get water supply as per their regular supply times.

61,2020/02/02,Routine check leads police to hawala racket,"A routine check during the Bahujan Kranti Morcha’s country-wide bandh earlier this week has opened an investigation into an Afghanistan-India hawala racket.

A 51-year-old Afghan national was taken into custody in Bhiwandi on Wednesday by the Nizampura police. The team was conducting routine checks near the State Transport bus depot as part of the increased security arrangements in light of the bandh.

“Muzammil Khan Gul was among the several people exiting the depot while our team was conducting checks. His overall demeanour showed that he was not a local and one of our personnel approached him. At that same time, two people coming towards him on a bike suddenly turned around and sped away, which increased suspicion against him,” an officer said.

Mr. Gul’s bag was searched and was found to contain a large amount of Indian currency. He was then taken to the police station where the money was counted and it totalled up to ₹2.95 lakh. The police also checked his documents and discovered that he had landed in New Delhi on a tourist visa on January 22.

“We found out that he buys beads used for making necklaces in wholesale quantities from Bhiwandi and takes them back home. He has confessed to having moved his money from Afghanistan to New Delhi through hawala channels, after which he collected it in cash and brought it to Bhiwandi,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Rajkumar Shinde, Zone II, Thane Police, said.

Mr. Shinde said Mr. Gul was also questioned by the Special Branch and the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad and no indication of him being involved in any terrorist activities have come to light. He was deported to Afghanistan on Friday.

Meanwhile, a report about the details of the hawala racket obtained from Mr. Gul is being shared with the Delhi Police and central agencies for further action, sources said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xpjzi0/article30716535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02bm-Afghan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/routine-check-leads-police-to-hawala-racket/article30716536.ece
62,2020/02/02,Why George Orwell matters today and why he will continue to matter,"The sale of George Orwell’s 1984 went up by 9,500 percent when Donald Trump took office. There is no figure available for India post 2014. Orwell saw the novel as a warning rather than a prophecy, but prophecies come true when warnings aren’t heeded. Who controls the present, he wrote, controls the past. Orwell is in the news again, 70 years after his death, as the man who – in the words of Christopher Hitchens – “faced the despotisms of his day with little more than a battered typewriter and a stubborn personality.”

Orwell didn’t change history, but he helped us understand it better. “One defeats a fanatic,” he wrote in a letter to a friend, “precisely by not being a fanatic oneself, but on the contrary, by using one’s intelligence.” Orwell is invoked around the world wherever civil rights are endangered or human decency is stifled by a fanatical adherence to its opposite.

The word ‘Orwellian’ is used to mean tyranny and fear of conformism, but as Hitchens points out, a piece of writing described as ‘Orwellian’ recognises that human resistance to the terrors is unquenchable.

If the word wasn’t carrying too much weight already, ‘Orwellian’ could also stand for a style of writing both simple and powerful. To use his own words, it was transparent, like a windowpane.

As Winston Smith says in 1984, “Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four. If that is granted, all else follows.”

The point is, it does not matter if two plus two is four; what matters is that you believe it, and importantly, can say it without being beaten up for it. Truth exists beyond any party ideology. This was the wonder of Orwell’s writing. The literal – Animal Farm is a lovely children’s story, after all – and the profound co-exist harmoniously.

Some writers startle by fission, by breaking things up; Orwell went the other way, surprising by fusion, by bringing things together.

“In a time of deceit,” he once wrote, “telling the truth is a revolutionary act.” On another occasion: “People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.” How did he know about us?

That’s the question populations fighting tyranny have asked for decades.

Two recent books have been published on Orwell. A biography (which belongs to the take-it-or-leave-it category), Orwell: A Man of Our Time by Richard Bradford, and the fascinating The Ministry of Truth: A Biography of George Orwell’s 1984 by Dorian Lynskey which is well-researched and increases our admiration for Orwell.

It is a reminder that books don’t spring up in isolation but are products of a time and place and owe as much to a writer’s imagination as to what went before.

""I hesitate to say that 1984 is more relevant than ever,"" writes Lynskey, ""but it's a damn sight more relevant than it should be."" To adapt Paul McCartney, when I find myself in times of trouble, George Orwell comes to me....

64,2020/02/02,A crowded ballot in Iowa with Sanders and Biden on top,"More than a handful of Democrats will compete with each other and indirectly against a highly controversial President Donald Trump, riding high on his imminent acquittal by the Senate, as the U.S. election season kicks off on Monday night with the Iowa Caucuses.

Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar who had been in Washington for Mr. Trump’s Senate trial dashed to Iowa for a hectic weekend of campaigning. Together with former Vice-President Joe Biden and former Southbend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the five candidates top the long list of Democratic hopefuls.

While Iowa, a mostly white and demographically non-representative state, just sends 41 delegates to the nominating convention later this year (1,991 are required to win) , it provides crucial early momentum to the leading candidates. Since Al Gore in 2000, every Democratic candidate who has won Iowa has gone on to win the party’s nomination.

Also read: U.S. Presidential Election 2020: What are the Democratic presidential primaries all about?

While Mr. Biden leads in national polls, in the countdown to Monday night, an average of Iowa polls from January 20-27 compiled by Real Clear Politics (RCP), shows Mr. Sanders in first place (23.8%) followed by Mr. Biden (20.2%), who is followed Mr. Buttigieg (15.8%) and Ms. Warren (14.6%).

Survey process

A crucial and closely followed (including by candidates) final poll on Saturday night from CNN/ Des Moines Register/ Mediacom, which might have lent more clarity to this crowded race, was not released due to concerns over the survey process.

At least 40% of voters say there is a “moderate chance” they will change their mind on Monday night, as per a Monmouth Universitsy poll from January, making it harder to tell which way the final delegate allocation will go.

Then there is the process. In general, if a candidate does not get more than 15% of the vote at a caucus location (there are some 1,680 in the state alone), voters there will have to realign with another candidate. This complicates prognostication even further. Given there are around five candidates who could achieve this threshold, it is unclear what the final allocation will look like. For instance, Ms. Klobuchar’s voters could realign with Mr. Biden, as his campaign is hoping, giving him an edge. Third, is the expected record turnout this year (the record is currently from 2008 with Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and John Edwards on the ballot), as per State Democratic Party Chairman Troy Price. If these are younger, first time primary voters they are likely to vote in favour of more progressive candidates like Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren.

“If there’s a huge voter turnout, you can turn off your TV — Bernie won,” Mr. Sanders spokesperson Mike Casa said, as per Politico.

Nevertheless, if the higher voter turnout is comprised of more moderate, older voters and independents, they’re more likely to choose Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg or Ms. Klobuchar (and that could, in turn, benefit Mr Biden). The Senator from Minnesota is betting on her organization across the state and making sure she hits counties that flipped from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump.

Regardless of differences in their tactics in Iowa, Democrats’ strategy is the same in one respect at least: sending out a strong message that Mr. Trump needs to be defeated and that each of them is the best person to do so. They are also being careful to not to push away any potential Democrat voter with intra-party mudslinging.

Call for unity

Elizabeth Warren called for unity among the party when a CNN reporter asked her about Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib booing Hilary Clinton on Friday night at a Sanders event. ”We have one really important job and that is to beat Donald Trump and our best chance to do that is when Democrats work together…,”she said.

There is a Democrat conspicuous by his absence from Iowa. Michael Bloomberg, who has already spent more than $200 million on his campaign, will enter the fray straight on March 3 or ‘ Super Tuesday’ where a large number of states vote.

After Iowa, candidates will face off in New Hampshire, then Nevada and South Carolina. In New Hampshire, Mr. Sanders leads Mr. Biden by a solid margin ( close to 10 points in RCP polling averages). Mr. Biden has a 17 point lead over Mr. Sanders in South Carolina – where he has the support of a large number of African American voters.

No matter who wins the Iowa Caucuses to contend for the Democratic nomination, they will also have to compete against Mr. Trump who has time, money — and now an acquittal — on his side.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y87pfa/article30720805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Iowa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-crowded-ballot-in-iowa-with-sanders-and-biden-on-top/article30720806.ece
65,2020/02/02,Police shoot man dead in London after ‘terror-related’ stabbings,"Three people suffered injuries in a terrorist attack in south London on Sunday, during which Scotland Yard officers shot dead a terror suspect strapped with a “hoax bomb“.

The Metropolitan Police said the incident in Streatham was part of an active counter-terror operation during which the male suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. A device strapped on his body was later established as fake at the end of the attack, which counter-terror officers believe to be “Islamist-related“.

According to reports, the deceased suspect had been released from prison recently after serving half of a three-year-and-four-month sentence for the possession and circulation of terrorist material.

He was named by the U.K. media as Sudesh Mamoor Faraz Amman, a London student believed to have family roots in Sri Lanka. He was jailed aged 18 in December 2018.

“As part of a proactive counter terrorism operation, armed officers were in immediate attendance and shot a male suspect, who was pronounced dead at the scene,” said Met Police Detective Assistant Commissioner Lucy D’Orsi.

“A device was found strapped to the body of the suspect and specialist officers attended (to it). Cordons were put in place and it was quickly established that this was a hoax device.

“The situation has been contained and officers from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command are now leading an investigation into the incident. The incident was quickly declared as a terrorist incident and we believe it to be Islamist-related,” she said.

Two of the three victims of the attack on the busy Streatham High Street at around 1400 GMT were stabbed and the third sustained injuries from broken glasses, triggered from the discharge of the police firearm for shooting down the suspect.

“Three victims have been taken to south London hospitals. One man is being treated as life-threatening, one woman has non-life threatening injuries and another woman has minor injuries,” Ms. D’Orsi added.

Emergency services, including paramedics and armed police, responded to the incident on Streatham High Road, from where social media images showed plain-clothed policemen pursuing a suspect who was later pronounced dead.

Some eyewitnesses reported seeing a machete-wielding man with some silver canisters strapped to his body before he was shot. Police shouted for people to “get back” as they cleared the area of shoppers and bystanders.

Pictures circulating on social media show the suspect face down and lying outside a Boots pharmacy shop as a police officer aims a gun. The Met Police have issued a “common sense” plea for restraint in circulating pictures and videos of the incident, including images of the officers involved and of the victim as it appealed to the public to share any footage of the attack with its investigating team.

Some reports suggest a man entered a shop and started stabbing people. It appears he then left the shop and stabbed a woman, possibly a cyclist. Witnesses reported hearing three gun shots, as armed police approached.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson took to Twitter to thank the emergency services for their response to the attack.

Thank you to all emergency services responding to the incident in Streatham, which the police have now declared as terrorism-related. My thoughts are with the injured and all those affected, he said.

Later, Mr. Johnson released a statement from Downing Street to reiterate plans for tougher sentences for convicted terrorists.

He said, “I want to pay tribute to the speed and bravery of the police who responded and confronted the attacker — preventing further injuries and violence — and all of the emergency services who came to the aid of others.

Tomorrow [Monday], we will announce further plans for fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences.

U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel said in her Twitter statement that she is being kept updated by the police on the developments and hailed the brave officers who contained the situation.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan also thanked emergency services for their “swift and courageous response”, adding: “They truly are the best of us.

“Terrorists seek to divide us and to destroy our way of life — here in London we will never let them succeed.”

In November last year, two people were killed after convicted terrorist Usman Khan went on a stabbing frenzy in London Bridge area of the UK capital.

It later emerged that Khan’s family originated from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and he was out on parole after serving part of his sentence for plotting terrorist attacks on the UK.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/177zs7/article30720781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINSTABBINGSjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/police-shoot-man-dead-in-london-after-terrorist-related-stabbings/article30720368.ece
66,2020/02/02,Coronavirus | United Arab Emirates confirms fifth case,"The United Arab Emirates has confirmed a new case of the novel coronavirus, taking the total number of people affected by the deadly disease to five in the country, according to media reports on February 2.

The Ministry of Health and Prevention on February 1 announced that the new case involves a Chinese travelling from Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, the Gulf News reported.

The person is currently receiving necessary treatment and his health condition is stable, the Ministry said.

The coronavirus outbreak has killed 305 people and infected 14,562 others as the Philippines on February 2 reported the first death outside China from the epidemic that has spread to 25 countries, including India, the U.S., the U.K. and Russia.

In China, all the deaths were reported in Hubei Province for which Wuhan is the capital.

Four cases earlier detected in the UAE involve a Chinese family from Wuhan. The family is still under medical care and their condition is stable, the report said.

Their general condition is stable, and there is no cause for concern about them, the Ministry was quoted as saying in the report.

The Khaleej Times reported the Ministry as saying that the number of cases detected in the country was very low and that there was no cause for concern.

The UAE is adhering to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO’s) directives in dealing with the cases detected, the report said.

The virus that emerged in early December is traced to a market in Wuhan that sells wild animals.

The WHO has declared the outbreak a global emergency on January 30 but did not advise international trade or travel restrictions.

According to a study by University of Hong Kong scientists, as many as 75,815 people in Wuhan may have been infected with the new coronavirus, the South China Morning Post reported.

The research, published in The Lancet on February 1, is based on the assumption that each infected person could have passed the virus on to 2.68 others, the Hong Kong-based daily said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ndvnec/article30719958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-UAE-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-united-arab-emirates-confirms-fifth-case/article30719959.ece
67,2020/02/02,Somalia declares massive locust infestation a national emergency,"Somalia on Sunday declared a locust infestation sweeping the Horn of Africa to be a national emergency, as insects devastate food supplies in one of the poorest and most vulnerable regions in the world.

“The Ministry of Agriculture... has declared a national emergency in view of the current desert locust upsurge, that poses a major threat to Somalia's fragile food security situation,” the ministry statement read.

Experts say the locust swarms are the result of extreme weather swings, and Somalia's declaration — the first country in the region to do so — is aimed at boosting national efforts in tackling the hungry insects.

The locusts, part of the grasshopper family, have led to what the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has termed the “worst situation in 25 years” in the Horn of Africa.

“Food sources for people and their livestock are at risk,” the agriculture ministry added.

“The desert locust swarms are uncommonly large and consume huge amounts of crops and forage.”

The emergency declaration was made to focus efforts and raise funds, because it was critical to contain the locust swarms before harvests are due in April, the ministry said.

Desert locusts, whose destructive infestations cause major crop damage and hunger, are a species of grasshopper that live largely solitary lives until a combination of conditions promote breeding and lead them to form massive swarms.

“Given the severity of this desert locust outbreak, we must commit our best efforts to protect the food security and livelihoods of Somali people,” said Minister of Agriculture Said Hussein Iid.

“If we don't act now, we risk a severe food crisis that we cannot afford.”

According to the regional Food Security and Nutrition Working Group, East Africa is already experiencing a high degree of food insecurity, with over 19 million people facing acute hunger.

Swarms of locusts, that were formed in eastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia, have moved through the region.

The FAO says the current invasion is known as an “upsurge” -- when an entire region is affected -- however, if it gets worse and cannot be contained, over a year or more, it would become what is known as a “plague” of locusts.

There have been six major desert locust plagues in the 1900s, the last of which was in 1987-89. The last major upsurge was in 2003-05.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pb5x84/article30719371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02LOCUSTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/somalia-declares-massive-locust-infestation-a-national-emergency/article30719372.ece
68,2020/02/02,Chinese central bank to pump $173 billion to boost economy amidst Coronavirus outbreak,"China’s central bank said Sunday it would pump 1.2 trillion yuan ($173 bln) into the economy as it ramps up support for a nationwide fight against a deadly virus that is expected to hit growth.

The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement it would launch a 1.2 trillion yuan reverse repurchase operation on Monday to maintain “reasonable and abundant liquidity” in the banking system, as well as a stable currency market, during the epidemic.

It added that the overall liquidity of the banking system would be 900 billion yuan ($129 bln) more than in the same period last year.

The move will kick in the day that China’s financial markets reopen, following an extended Spring Festival break.

The virus has now infected over 14,000 people in China and claimed over 300 lives.

On Saturday, the PBOC also announced a range of measures to step up monetary and credit support to enterprises which are helping in its fight against the virus epidemic, such as medical companies.

China’s central bank urged financial institutions to provide “sufficient credit resources” to hospitals and other medical organisations, among other measures.

The move to inject liquidity into its financial system comes as the virus threatens to take a toll on an already slowing economy.

China saw economic growth of 6.1% last year, the slowest in around three decades. Analysts are warning this could weaken further if the spread of the SARS-like virus goes on for an extended period.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lf2mtw/article30718343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAPANCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-central-bank-to-pump-173-bln-to-economy-in-virus-boost/article30718896.ece
69,2020/02/02,Driver charged after 4 children killed on Sydney sidewalk,"An alleged drunk driver has been charged with multiple offenses including manslaughter after a SUV struck seven children on a Sydney sidewalk, killing four and seriously injuring a fifth.

The children were walking to buy ice cream when they were struck before 8 p.m. on Saturday by a vehicle driven by Samuel Davidson, police said.

Three of the children killed were siblings and their brother was taken to a hospital in serious conditions. The fourth child killed was the daughter of their father’s cousin.

The father, Danny Abdallah, told reporters on Sunday he was heartbroken.

“I don’t know what to say. I’m numb,” Mr. Abdallah said. “All I want to say is- please, drivers, be careful.”

“These kids were just walking innocently, enjoying each other’s company ... and this morning I woke up and I have lost three kids,” he added.

Mr. Abdallah and his wife Leila had had six children. He said his cousin had also lost an 11-year-old child in the tragedy, Veronique Sakr.

Another two girls, aged 10 and 13, suffered minor injuries, authorities said.

Davidson, the alleged driver, was arrested at the scene on Saturday and remained in custody.

The 20 charges against him, including four of manslaughter, were read in a Sydney court on Sunday. He did not appear in court and was refused bail until his next court appearance on April 2.

Davidson allegedly recorded a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.15% -- three-times the legal limit in Australia.

Acting Assistant Police Commissioner Jason Joyce said the driver remained at the scene until the police arrived and there were indications his 24-year-old male passenger tried to help some of the children. Neither the driver nor the passenger was injured.

Abdallah said all seven children injured were related and were staying at the Abdallah house.

“They were all coming over to get babysat. I told them- ‘Just go for a walk, little walk, stay together. You should be OK,’” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/278d60/article30718658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIACHILDRENDEATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/driver-charged-after-4-children-killed-on-sydney-sidewalk/article30718646.ece
70,2020/02/02,At least 20 killed in stampede at Tanzania church service,"At least 20 people have been killed and over a dozen injured in a stampede during a church service at a stadium in northern Tanzania, a government official said on Sunday.

Hundreds of people packed a stadium on Saturday evening in Moshi town near the slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro and crushed each other as they rushed to get anointed with “blessed oil”.

“Twenty people died and 16 others were injured in the incident,” Moshi district commissioner Kippi Warioba told Reuters by telephone. Five of those killed were children, he said.

“The stampede occurred when the worshippers were rushing to get anointed with blessed oil,” Warioba said.

Pastor Boniface Mwamposa has been drawing huge crowds by promising prosperity and cure for disease to worshippers who walk on what he describes as “blessed oil” during his church services.

Authorities fear the death toll could rise due to the size of the crowd and dark conditions when the stampede occurred.

“The incident took place at night and there were many people, so there is a possibility that more casualties could emerge. We are still assessing the situation,” Mr. Warioba said.

Tanzania has seen a rise in the number of “prosperity gospel” pastors in recent years, who promise to lift people out of poverty and perform what they call miracle cures.

Thousands of people in the nation of 55 million flock to Pentecostal churches, whose main source of income is “tithe”, the 10% or so of income that worshippers are asked to contribute.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/w5j70u/article30719949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tanzania,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/at-least-20-killed-in-stampede-at-tanzania-church-service/article30718497.ece

Riviera Beach police said in a statement that the shooting happened near the Victory City Church shortly after 2:30 p.m. They said a 15-year-old boy and the man died at the scene. A woman and a teenager were taken to the hospital. Their conditions were not released, nor the names of the victims. No arrests have been made.

Police said listening devices in the area that detect the sound of gunshots counted 13 rounds fired.

Pastor Tywuante D. Lupoe said in a video statement posted on Facebook that the church was very aware that violence was a possibility at the funeral because of a family dispute and that it had provided armed security. A Riviera Beach police officer also was present, he said.

He said the security guards and police officer had left after the service when there were only a few stragglers remaining in the area. He said that’s when a fight broke out across the street from the church and the shooting erupted. He said none of the victims are church members and no one was injured on its property. He did not provide further details about the funeral.

This is an isolated incident and it had nothing to do with Victory City Church, Lupoe said.

Only one resident per household is allowed to go out every two days to buy necessities, authorities said in the city of nine million, while 46 highway toll stations have been closed.

Zhejiang province has the highest number of confirmed cases outside central Hubei province at 661 confirmed infections, with 265 of those in Wenzhou.

The city — which is more than 800 kilometres away by road from Wuhan, the epicentre — has also cancelled public events and closed public places like swimming pools, cinemas and museums.

Wenzhou's metro line and public transport have also been suspended as have inter-province buses.

Schools and universities will not resume classes until after March 1, and authorities said enterprises should not resume work until after February 17 -- except government institutions and administrative departments which will start work on February 9.

74,2020/02/02,Coronavirus | Japan confirms three more citizens evacuated from Wuhan test positive,"Japan confirmed an additional three cases of the new coronavirus among evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan, including one who initially tested negative, the health ministry said on Saturday, bringing the country's total to 20 cases.

One of the three, a man in his 40s who had symptoms such as fever and coughing, first tested negative for coronavirus, the ministry said. But the man, who was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, later confirmed positive for the virus with an additional test, it said.

The government plans to send another chartered plane mid-week or later to bring back Japanese nationals who are still in China's Hubei province and its capital Wuhan, where the disease is thought to have originated, the foreign ministry said on Sunday.

Japan has emailed its citizens in the province to tell them of its plan, and is negotiating with China about Chinese spouses of Japanese citizens who also wish to travel to Japan, it said.

China is facing mounting isolation amid increasing international travel curbs and flight suspensions as the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak surged past 300.

75,2020/02/02,Japanese warship departs for Gulf to patrol oil lifeline,"A Japanese destroyer left for the Gulf of Oman on Sunday amid simmering Middle East tension to guard sea lanes that supply nearly all the oil that powers the world's third-biggest economy.

“Thousands of Japanese ships ply those waters every year including vessels carrying nine tenths of our oil. It is Japan's lifeline,” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the crew at Yokosuka naval base near Tokyo, before they cast off in a ceremony attended by 500 family members and representatives from the United States, European nations and Middle East.

Abe's government has said it is prepared to authorise force to protect ships in danger, a controversial decision because Japan's war-renouncing constitution forbids the use of military force in international disputes.

The Takanami, which will be joined by two maritime patrol planes, will not, however join a naval force led by Japan's U.S. ally or other naval coalitions in the region.

Tokyo has chosen to operate independently as it navigates disputes in the volatile region. Japan maintains cordial relations with Iran and other countries there and Abe travelled to the region in January to brief Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Oman on the mission after earlier speaking with Iranian leaders.

Tension in the Middle East has heightened as friction between Iran and the United States escalated following U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and re-impose sanctions on it.

The United States has blamed Iran for several attacks on international merchant vessels, including a Japanese-owned tanker, the Kokuka Courageous. Tehran denies the accusation.

In addition to the Gulf of Oman, the Takanami, with 200 sailors and two helicopters, will patrol the northern Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden, but will not enter the Strait of Hormuz, a strategically important choke point between Iran and the Arabian peninsula.

The Japanese destroyer will share water in the region with a growing number of warships from other countries, including vessels from the United States, France and Britain.

“Japanese merchant ships were attacked in June, and other nations have increased patrols so Japan too is acting to gather intelligence there,” the mission commander, Captain Yosuke Inaba told reporters before he departed.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/t2lzvm/article30718287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-SECURITYJAPAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japanese-warship-departs-for-gulf-to-patrol-oil-lifeline/article30718288.ece
76,2020/02/02,"Philippines reports first coronavirus fatality, second confirmed infection","The Philippines on February 2 reported the first overseas death from the growing epidemic of a coronavirus that originated in China, where new confirmed infections jumped by a daily record to top 14,000 cases.

Authorities in the Philippines said a 44-year-old man from Wuhan city in central Hubei province had died after developing severe pneumonia. It was the first death reported out of more than 130 cases in around two dozen other countries and regions outside of mainland China.

The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in China had reached 304 as of the end of Saturday, state broadcaster CCTV said on Sunday, citing the country's National Health Commission.

All the new deaths in China and most of the new infections on Saturday were in Hubei, the epicentre of the flu-like coronavirus outbreak.

China is facing mounting isolation as other countries introduce travel curbs, airlines suspend flights and governments evacuate their citizens, risking worsening a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy.

The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, but said global trade and travel restrictions are not needed.

However, some countries are responding to fears of the virus spreading by ramping up border controls. Singapore and the United States announced measures on Friday to ban foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering their territories, and Australia followed suit on Saturday.

Russia introduced visa restrictions and will start evacuating Russian citizens on Monday and Tuesday, Interfax and TASS news agencies reported.

The Philippines also expanded its travel ban to include all foreigners coming from China, widening an earlier restriction that covered only those from Hubei.

More than 100 Germans and family members landed in Frankfurt on Saturday after being evacuated from Wuhan. Around 250 Indonesians were being evacuated from Hubei.

U.S. health officials on Saturday confirmed an eighth case of the coronavirus in the United States, and the Pentagon said it would provide housing for people arriving from overseas who might need to be quarantined. The country has introduced mandatory quarantine for citizens arriving from Hubei.

In Mexico, ride-hailing application Uber Technologies Inc said it suspended 240 accounts of users in Mexico who may recently have come in contact with someone possibly infected with the virus.

There are no confirmed cases in Mexico yet.

Province in lockdown

The number of deaths in Hubei from the outbreak had risen to 294 as of the end of Feb. 1, with a total 9,074 cases, the majority in the capital Wuhan, where the virus is thought to have emerged late last year in a market illegally trading wildlife.

New confirmed cases also surged by 276 in nearby Huanggang. One death was reported in the city, about 60 km (37 miles) east of Wuhan.

China's environment ministry on Saturday urged local governments to step up disposal of medical and urban wastewater to prevent the spread of the virus.

Local authorities in quarantined areas must disinfect faeces and sewage, the ministry also said.

Genetic traces of the coronavirus were found in the faeces of some patients, said the health authority of Shenzhen, one of the most populous cities in China.

Hubei has been under virtual quarantine for the last week, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down. The province extended its Lunar New Year holiday break to Feb. 13 in a bid to contain the outbreak.

But some people are leaving Hubei on foot over a bridge spanning the Yangtze river, entering Jiujiang city in neighbouring Jiangxi province.

Lu Yuejin, a 50-year-old farmer from a village on the Hubei side of the bridge, was trying to gain passage for her leukaemia-stricken daughter on Saturday.

“Please, take my daughter. I don't need to go past... please, just let my daughter go past,” Lu pleaded with the police.

Eventually, Lu and her daughter were both allowed through and an ambulance was called to pick them up.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/o9aybo/article30670855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th27-BINDU-LANCGA271L4VR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/philippines-reports-first-coronavirus-fatality-second-confirmed-infection/article30718271.ece
77,2020/02/02,Coronavirus: death toll in China surges past 300,"The death toll from China's coronavirus epidemic soared to 304 on February 2, as an increasing number of countries imposed extraordinary Chinese travel bans to combat the spread of the disease.

With Britain, Russia and Sweden among the countries confirming their first infections, the virus has now spread to more than two dozen nations, sending governments scurrying to limit their exposure.

The United States and Australia are leading a growing list of countries that are putting temporary but sweeping travel restrictions on Chinese nationals or those who have travelled to China within the last two weeks.

""Foreign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents... will be denied entry into the United States,” Health Secretary Alex Azar had announced. Australia said it was barring entry to non-citizens arriving from China, while Australian citizens who had travelled there would be required to go into ""self-isolation"" for two weeks.

Vietnam suspended all flights from mainland China effective Saturday, while Russia announced it would halt visa-free tourism for Chinese nationals and stop issuing them work visas. Similar expansive restrictions have been announced by countries including Italy, Singapore, and China's northern neighbour Mongolia. The United States, Japan, Britain, Germany and other nations had already advised their citizens not to travel to China.

Thousands of Hong Kong medical workers voted to commence a four-day strike from Monday to push the government to close its border with mainland China to stop the virus, which has already spread to the financial hub.

Britain said Saturday it was temporarily withdrawing some diplomatic staff and their families from across China, a day after the US State Department ordered embassy employees to send home family members under the age of 21.

Beijing insists it can contain the virus and called Washington's advice against travel to China ""unkind"". The U.S. emergency declaration also requires Americans returning from Hubei province to be placed in mandatory 14-day quarantine, and health screening for American citizens coming from other parts of China.

Mea culpa

With public anger mounting in China, Wuhan's top official admitted late Friday that authorities there had acted too slowly.

""If strict control measures had been taken earlier the result would have been better than now,"" said Ma Guoqiang, the Communist Party chief for Wuhan.

Wuhan officials have been criticised online for withholding information about the outbreak until late December despite knowing of it weeks earlier. China finally lurched into action last week, effectively quarantining whole cities in Hubei and tens of millions of people.

Unprecedented safeguards imposed nationwide include postponing the return to school, cutting bus and train routes, and tightening health screening on travellers nationwide.

Authorities in Hubei have extended the new year holiday until February 13 and suspended marriage registrations from Monday to discourage public gatherings. The city of Huanggang, east of Wuhan, said only one member of each household would be permitted to leave the house every two days to buy necessities. But the toll keeps mounting, with health authorities in Hubei on Sunday reporting 45 more deaths in the preceding 24 hours.

The number of confirmed infections across China passed 14,300 on Sunday, the National Health Commission announced — far higher than the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS) outbreak of 2002-03.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a global emergency on Thursday but later warned that closing borders was probably ineffective in halting transmission and could accelerate the virus's spread. But authorities around the world pressed ahead with preventive measures.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/we03vf/article30718252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHIRAQ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-death-toll-in-china-surges-past-300/article30718253.ece
78,2020/02/02,'Please take my daughter': Mother of girl with cancer pleads at Jiujiang virus blockade,"Hours ticked by on February 1 as 50-year-old Lu Yuejin struggled to get past the police checkpoint on the bridge over the Yangtze river and out of Hubei province, which is on virtual lockdown as China scrambles to control a coronavirus outbreak.

Lu, a farmer from a village on the Hubei province side of the bridge, was trying to gain passage for her daughter, 26-year-old Hu Ping, who has leukaemia. She has been unable to receive a second round of chemotherapy treatment in the overwhelmed hospitals of provincial capital Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.

“My daughter needs to go to hospital in Jiujiang,” she said at the checkpoint. “She needs to have her treatment. But they won't let us through.”

Her daughter sat on the ground wrapped in a blanket while Lu tearfully pleaded with police.

“Please, take my daughter. I don't need to go past ... please, just let my daughter go past,” she asked.

Her pleas were almost drowned out by a loudspeaker playing a pre-recorded message that residents would not be allowed into Jiujiang, the Jiangxi province city on the southern side of the Yangtze.

The bridge has been largely closed off in an attempt to halt the spread of coronavirus, which has infected 14,380 people, the vast majority of them in China, and killed more than 300.

Dozens of people have attempted to cross the police checkpoint in recent days. Some had succeeded by holding the right train or plane ticket departing from Jiujiang and bought before January 24, but many had failed.

For much of the morning of February 1, that was the case for Lu as she pleaded her daughter's case with authorities.

“All I want to do is save her life,” she said.

Phone calls were made, an ambulance was called and Lu and Hu were both eventually allowed through.

80,2020/02/02,U.S. lawmakers hail contributions of Sikhs in American milieu,"More than a dozen Congressmen gathered at the U.S. Capitol this week to celebrate immense contributions of the small but vibrant Sikh community in American milieu.

Sikhs are America’s exemplary community, said the Congressmen addressing a gathering of more than 200 members of the community.

81,2020/02/02,Google celebrates Scottish scientist Mary Somerville,"Google’s home page opened today to a doodle honouring Scottish scientist and science writer Mary Somerville. Focusing on the wide range of subjects she contributed to, the doodle shows her at her writing table surrounded by thought bubbles and books.

According to Google’s doodle page, it was on this day in 1826, that one of her experimental physics papers was read by the Royal Society of London. It also became the first paper by a female author to be published in the Philosophical Transactions.

Mary Sommerville was born on December 26,1780. Her father, Sir William Fairfax, was a vice-admiral in the British navy. Her mother, Margaret Charters, was the daughter of Samuel Charters, the solicitor of customs in Scotland.

When Sommerville stumbled upon algebra and maths, it became her lifelong passion. Mary wrote four books: Mechanism of the Heavens, On the Connection of the Physical Sciences, Physical Geography, Molecular and Microscopic Science.

She is featured on the Royal Bank of Scotland’s polymer £10 note launched in 2017, along with a quote from her second book:

Anyone who has observed the reflection

of the waves from a wall on the side of a river

after the passage of a stream-boat,

will have a perfect idea of the reflection of sound and light.

The Royal Bank of Scotland has never before featured a woman on its main issue bank notes. The choice of Mary Somerville for the note was made following a public vote across social media.

Although well recognised by her male colleagues, Somerville did face some amount of discrimination. But this only gave her an opening to fight for women's rights. Once, Sir John Herschel wrote to ask her to try out a powerful new telescope that an Italian colleague, DeVico, was using. Although Mary was the most qualified person to judge DeVico's claims, she was unable to do so. Her gender hindered her. As a woman, she was forbidden to enter the monastery, the Collegio Romano, where the instrument was housed.

The discrimination Mary suffered opened her eyes to the causes of others. Mary became an ardent supporter of women's rights.

In 1835, Mary was elected member of the Royal Astronomical Society (along with Caroline Herschel), becoming one of the first two women to receive this honour. She passed away peacefully in her sleep, in Naples, Italy, in 1872. Until the time of her death, she continued to work on mathematics. After her death at the age of 92, Somerville College at Oxford University was named in her honour.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xbp6tm/article30718196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/celebrating-mary-somerville-6753651837108667-2xjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/google-celebrates-scottish-scientist-mary-somerville/article30718201.ece
82,2020/02/02,Israel widens China travel ban over virus fears,"Israel's interior ministry said on Saturday it was broadening border restrictions to bar entry to anyone who has visited China in the past two weeks.

On Thursday the country barred all flights from China over concern about the coronavirus epidemic, amid growing fears of global contagion.

Saturday's interior ministry announcement went further, blocking passengers from third countries if they had been in China at any time in the past 14 days.

The ban covers air and sea ports as well as land crossings from neighbouring Jordan and Egypt.

The order does not apply to Israeli citizens. Israelis who have been in China have been told to quarantine themselves at home for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms.

There have been no recorded incidents of coronavirus in Israel yet, but the health ministry said Wednesday it was “a matter of time”.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will on Sunday convene government ministers, top civil servants, health officials and the head of Israel's National Security Council to assess the country's preparedness, a statement from the premier's office said.

83,2020/02/02,Hingson and the pistol of peace,"When the Soviet Union and the U.S. were busying themselves with the Cold War and the accompanying Space Age, there were scientists and physicians, from these two countries and from across the world, who were battling together in another war front – one against an infectious disease. By 1959, the World Health Organisation (WHO) actively campaigned for the eradication of smallpox – a contagious disease that originated over 3,000 years ago and one of the deadliest diseases known to humanity.

A vaccine for smallpox

People had known for long enough that those who contracted cowpox, a much less dangerous disease than smallpox, were immune to smallpox. By the end of the 18th Century, it had been demonstrated that inoculation with cowpox was not only effective, but also safe. As vaccination became common in the 19th and 20th Centuries, smallpox declined. But with increased travel making the world ever smaller, its presence in less-developed and remote areas presented a difficulty to even those who lived in countries where it had been eradicated.

Initial estimates suggested that over a billion people, some living in almost inaccessible areas, had to be vaccinated to break the global chain of infection. It was important to have a tool that could administer the vaccine in an easy, efficient and cost-effective way and that was made possible by American physician Robert Andrew Hingson.

Hingson made crucial contributions in the field of anaesthesia, including developing the technique of caudal anaesthesia and perfecting lumbar epidural anaesthesia for women in labour. Both these techniques were instrumental in reducing maternal and infant mortality throughout the world. Hingson is also well known as a humanitarian and was a pioneer in public health, setting up a foundation in 1958 to expand basic health care.

Hingson’s inspiration

It is believed that the idea of developing a high-speed jet injector struck Hingson while serving as the Chief of the Department of Anaesthesiology at the U.S. Marine Hospital in Staten Island, New York. On treating an unusual injury where a sailor had injected diesel oil into his hand accidentally without leaving any visible wound, Hingson got thinking.

Even though he wasn’t the first to come up with such an idea, Hingson’s jet injector lent itself to affordability and speed – attributes that made it an accessible tool for mass-immunisation projects. Without needles and syringes, Hingson’s invention could hold over 500 doses of the vaccine at a time and administer it to hundreds of people in an hour.

Can be diluted

On February 2, 1962, Hingson led a team to Liberia aboard the U.S.S Diamond Head. Realising that only 10,000 of the promised one million doses of smallpox vaccine was on board, Hingson came up with a successful means of using it in diluted form. Agreeing to a dilution of one to 11, nearly 1,10,000 people were vaccinated, by which time more supplies reached them. In all, nearly a million people in Liberia were immunised against smallpox.

With WHO also adopting the jet injector, Hingson’s pistol of peace was employed far and wide against a number of diseases. His jet injector earned the nicknames “shanti ki banduk” in India and “la pistola de la paz” in Nicaragua, different versions of “the peace gun” in Hindi and Spanish.

Smallpox eradicated

Even though the jet injector played a crucial role in the early stages of smallpox eradication, it was eventually used only in places where the programme was highly organised. This was because the wear and tear often damaged the equipment, and it also had to be maintained in a highly sanitised manner. These reasons eventually led to the downfall of jet injectors, as contaminated tools were involved in the spread of diseases, defeating its purpose.

By the end of 1979, the global eradication of smallpox was certified and by 1980 it was endorsed by the World Health Assembly. As for Hingson, he remained a professor until 1973, when he switched to full-time relief work with his foundation. He continued this till 1982 and died in 1996, aged 83.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/sa1ki6/article30650786.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02istbpeacegun1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/hingson-and-the-pistol-of-peace/article30650788.ece

85,2020/02/02,Sereie A | Ronaldo continues scoring run with two penalties as Juventus stay top,"Cristiano Ronaldo converted two penalties as he scored for the ninth Serie A game in a row on Sunday to give Juventus a somewhat flattering 3-0 win over Fiorentina which kept them top of Serie A.

The Portuguese squeezed his shot under Bartlomiej Dragowski in the 40th minute and sent the Fiorentina goalkeeper the wrong way late in the second half to take his tally for the season to 19, including 14 in the last nine games.

Defender Matthijs De Ligt headed the third in stoppage time to add to Fiorentina’s sense of injustice after they held their own for much of the game.

The award of the second penalty, after Rodrigo Bentancur went down under a challenge from Federico Ceccherini, was met with angry protests by the visitors.

Juventus, who bounced back from last week’s 2-1 defeat by Napoli, have 54 points from 22 games, six ahead of Inter Milan who were away to Udinese later on Sunday.

“Ronaldo keeps on scoring and that is good for his state of mind,” said Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri. “He’s in great physical shape and is making the difference. The other forwards also did well and the problem is who to leave out.”

Fiorentina, who suffered their first defeat in five league games under coach Giuseppe Iachini, could easily have scored first as Federico Chiesa forced Wojciech Szczesny to make a fingertip save and Pol Lirola also tested the Juventus goalkeeper.

Instead, Juventus were awarded the penalty after Miralem Pjanic’s shot hit German Pezzella’s raised hand and, after waiting for the referee to confirm his decision with the pitchside monitor, Ronaldo scored with a low shot to his left.

The Portuguese became the second Juventus player to score in nine league games in a row after David Trezeguet.

Marco Benassi was close to a Fiorentina equaliser after halftime while Dragowski did superbly to block Gonzalo Higuain’s close-range effort after a Douglas Costa run.

Fiorentina’s resistance ended when Bentancur slalomed his way through the defence and appeared to run into Ceccherini. However, the defender had his arm raised and the referee gave a penalty which he confirmed after a VAR review.

Ceccherini was booked for dissent and Ronaldo again scored with a shot to his left while Dragowski this time went the other way.

De Ligt outjumped the Fiorentina defence at a corner for the third and Ceccherini protested again to the referee after the final whistle.

“The lads did well, we gave little away against a great team,” said Iachini. “We could have done better with our final pass.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/58wnac/article30720305.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RONALDO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/sereie-a-ronaldo-continues-scoring-run-with-two-penalties-as-juventus-stay-top/article30720306.ece
86,2020/02/02,Indian Women's League | Sandhiya’s brace sets up Sethu’s win,"A brace from Sandhiya powered Sethu FC to a 3-0 win over Kickstart FC in the Hero IWL here on Sunday. The defending champion took the lead in the 12th minute, when Amsavalli played Sandhiya through with a long pass. The latter made no mistake, dinking the ball over the goalkeeper’s head. The second goal arrived in the 39th minute, when Sumithra found the net from 30 yards out with a powerful strike.

Sandhiya netted another in the dying minutes of the game, to take her tally of goals at the tournament to nine. Gokulam Kerala’s Sabitra Bhandari tops the charts, with 14 goals from three games. Sethu is now in second spot in Group A, with nine points from four matches; three points behind, in third place, is Kickstart.

Leading Group A, though, is KRYPHSA (12 points), which demolished BBK DAV 4-0 in the day’s other game. Ratanbala Devi scored a brace while Anju Tamang and Sweety Devi also found the net.

The results: BBK DAV 0 lost to KRYPHSA 4 (Anju Tamang 18, Ratanbala Devi 62, 85, Sweety Devi 90+4); Sethu FC 3 (Sandhiya 12, 90, Sumithra 39) bt Kickstart FC 0.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/kaj47o/article30720271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th03foot,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/indian-womens-league-sandhiyas-brace-sets-up-sethus-win/article30720272.ece
87,2020/02/02,Lobera a tough act to emulate,"FC Goa’s reputation for continuity took a blow when, for the first time since its entry into the Indian Super League, the chief coach headed for the exit door as the competition approaches the knockout phase.

Sergio Lobera being asked to leave is strange, going by the Goa franchise management’s style of giving the carefully-chosen professional manager enough room to run the show, from player recruitment to choosing support staff to football operations.

Zico called the shots from 2014-2016 as the first coach, drafting World Cup defender Lucio into the side as marquee player/captain and moulding the team as per his vision. Andre Santos, Leo Moura, and Jonathan Lucca were the other Brazilians contracted by the franchise. They finally made way for a Spaniard with a lower profile. The new-look FCG then achieved twin objectives from 2017 to 2019 — success on the pitch and popularity with the fans.

Hazy

In the absence of an official communication, the reasons for a club snapping links with a proven coach are hazy. What is clear though is that the Spaniard’s knack in moulding the players to play eye-catching, effective football had won over the fans. After the ups and downs (season one semifinalist, season two finalist, and season three last team in the league) under Zico, matching the highs under Lobera will be a tough act to emulate.

Zico in the dugout and Brazilians in the line-up revived Goan interest in football watching. Lobera’s team then got them hooked with a brand of playing close to Goan hearts. The Gaurs wove passing patterns on the pitch, mastered one-touch play, scored goals in plenty and qualified for the semifinal and the final in consecutive seasons. With three games left in ISL season six and a semifinal berth confirmed, the next coach faces a tough task in matching Zico and Lobera’s feat of developing Goan footballers.

The rise of Mandar

Mandar Dessai’s rise from an attacking option on the left wing under the Brazilian, to promotion as captain in a new role as overlapping left wing-back is a huge step taken by the Spaniard. The Goan — with ball-playing skills and armed with a lethal left-foot — earned an India call-up after his displays with FCG last season.

Other Goans emerging as competent performers in Lobera’s presence over two seasons were defender Seriton Fernandes, attacking midfielders Brandon Fernandes and Lenny Rodrigues. The Spaniard and his support team (assistant coach Jesus Tato from Spain) deserve credit for bringing out the best in a group of hard-working Indians and hand-picked foreigners. Together, they brought back the crowds to Nehru stadium, Margao, the Gaurs’ home base.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/kbdfwz/article30720923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03LOBERA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/lobera-a-tough-act-to-emulate/article30720065.ece
88,2020/02/02,Sassuolo claim first Serie A win over Roma,"Francesco Caputo scored a quick-fire brace to pave the way for Sassuolo's first-ever Italian top-flight victory over Roma as the capital club slumped to a 4-2 loss on Saturday.

Paulo Fonseca's Roma remain fourth but their Champions League berth is now at risk with Atalanta just a point behind in fifth before they play struggling Genoa on Sunday.

Caputo scored twice within the first quarter of an hour in Emilia-Romagna, as Roberto De Zerbi's side pulled Roma apart.

Filip Djuricic slid in the third on 26 minutes.

Skipper Edin Dzeko scored his 100th Roma goal on 55 minutes, but his team were hit by Lorenzo Pellegrini's sending off for a second yellow card 14 minutes later.

A Jeremie Boga handball threw Roma a lifeline with Jordan Veretout making no mistake from the spot on 73 minutes.

But Ivorian Boga immediately made amends, cutting inside to rifle in a superb fourth goal.

Sassuolo, sitting 13th, had never beaten Roma in 13 top-flight meetings and had lost the reverse fixture 4-2 in September at the Stadio Olimpico.

It was Roma's fourth defeat this year.

Cornelius frustrates Cagliari

Earlier on Saturday in Sardinia, Andreas Cornelius's last-gasp header grabbed a 2-2 draw for Parma to further frustrate Cagliari in a clash between rivals for Europa League qualification.

The Danish forward nodded in a curling Jasmin Kurtic cross in the 94th minute to deny Cagliari a first league win since December 2.

The Sardinians remain sixth, in the final Europa League berth, but Parma are level on points and only behind on head-to-head record.

Both can be overtaken by in-form AC Milan, who are a point adrift before hosting Hellas Verona on Sunday.

Cagliari had looked set to end their two-month winless run after Giovanni Simeone put the hosts 2-1 up after 53 minutes.

Simeone had also provided the assist for Joao Pedro's opening goal on 19 minutes at the Sardegna Arena.

But Juraj Kucka levelled for Parma just before the break with Brazilian Pedro missing a penalty in the second half.

Simeone slid to tap in Luca Pellegrini's low cross and give the hosts the advantage, but Cornelius snatched a point with his eighth league goal this season.

The Sardinians are on a run of four defeats and four draws from their last eight league outings, including last weekend's stalemate at title-chasing Inter Milan.

The European battle remains tight with Bologna two points behind in ninth after snatching a 2-1 win over rock-bottom Brescia.

Mattia Bani got the winner a minute from time to hand Sinisa Mihajlovic's side their first victory of 2020, with the Serb making a rare appearance on the bench as he undergoes cancer treatment.

Ernesto Torregrossa had put Brescia ahead from the penalty spot on 36 minutes, but Riccardo Orsolini grabbed the equaliser just before the break.

Bani slotted in his fourth goal of the season to seal a first win since December 15.

On Sunday, reigning champions Juventus face Fiorentina with second-placed Inter Milan, three points off the pace, travelling to Udinese, looking to end their run of three successive 1-1 draws.

89,2020/02/02,English Premier League | Rudiger scores brace,"Frank Lampard admitted Chelsea faces a fight to finish in the Premier League’s top four after Antonio Rudiger’s second goal of the game earned a 2-2 draw against Leicester on Saturday.

Rudiger put Chelsea ahead early in the second half before Harvey Barnes and Ben Chilwell scored in quick succession to give Leicester the lead.

A thrilling second-half climaxed when Rudiger became the first defender to score a brace for Chelsea in the Premier League since John Terry against Fulham in 2013.

“We were the better team in the first half, in terms of how we moved the ball, and we created some gilt-edged chances. In the second half we weren’t so fluid and they created some good chances themselves,” Lampard said.

Frustrated that Chelsea failed to make any signings during the window, Lampard this week claimed his team are now underdogs in the race to qualify for next season’s Champions League via a top-four finish.

Depending on Manchester United and Tottenham’s results, Lampard’s prediction could look prescient by the conclusion of the weekend’s action.

Third-placed Leicester could be more sanguine about the result as it sits eight points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea, which has now won just one of its last five league games.

“We should have won having gone 2-1 up. We gifted them two goals really, which we’re disappointed with,” Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said. “But what we did was show a fantastic mentality to come from behind against a really good side with top level players.”

Lampard dropped Kepa Arrizabalaga after some error-prone displays from the Chelsea goalkeeper, with 38-year-old Willy Caballero making his first league appearance since May.

Jamie Vardy was back from injury but Leicester’s 17-goal leading scorer hadn’t netted in his last four league games and he wasted a good chance to put the host ahead when he burst onto Ayoze Perez’s chestdown in the penalty area, only to shoot straight at Caballero.

Sloppy defending

Leicester looked low on confidence at times. Hamza Choudhury should have put the team in front on the stroke of half-time but, befitting the scrappy showing, the midfielder couldn’t keep his close-range effort on target.

Choudhury was at fault again when Chelsea snatched the lead in the 46th minute. When Mason Mount swung a corner towards the far post, Choudhury misjudged his jump and Rudiger got behind him to head in from close range.

It was the perfect way for the German defender to mark his 100th Chelsea appearance as he scored only his fifth goal for the Blues.

But Chelsea’s defence remains far from impregnable and Leicester hit back to equalise eight minutes later.

Pinpoint pass

James Maddison found Youri Tielemans and the Belgian’s pinpoint pass sent Barnes racing away down the left wing.

Cutting back into the Chelsea area, Barnes tried his luck with a low strike that took a deflection off Andreas Christensen and looped over Caballero into the net for the winger’s fourth goal in his last six games.

Chelsea conceded again in the 64th minute as more sloppy defending allowed Leicester to sweep through.

Caballero rashly rushed off his line in a failed attempt to reach an over-hit cross and Chilwell was left unmarked in the area to fire home from Tielemans’ pass.

To its credit, Chelsea didn’t throw in the towel and Rudiger equalised in the 71st minute, the centre-back rising above Chilwell to power a superb header over Kasper Schmeichel from Mount’s free-kick.

Leicester should have won it but Jonny Evans headed wide from six yards before Barnes flicked past the far post from close range.

Sixth straight win

Bayern Munich fired in three goals in the opening 26 minutes to ease past host Mainz 3-1 on Saturday and go two points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with its sixth straight league win. Robert Lewandowski headed in his 22nd league goal in the eighth minute and Thomas Mueller and Thiago Alcantara added two more.

The results: EPL: Leicester 2 (Barnes 54, Chilwell 64) drew with Chelsea 2 (Rudiger 46, 71).

La Liga: Granada 2 (Machis 38, Fernandez Luna 46) bt Espanyol 1 (de Tomas 27-pen).

90,2020/02/02,"Liverpool move 22 points clear, Man Utd held on Fernandes debut","Liverpool surged 22 points clear at the top of the Premier League with a 4-0 win over Southampton, while Bruno Fernandes made his Manchester United debut in a goalless draw against Wolves on Saturday.

Mohamed Salah scored twice as the champions-elect equalled a Premier League record with a 20th straight home win at Anfield.

Southampton believed they should have had a penalty early in the second half when Danny Ings went down in the box against his old club, but no spot-kick was given. Liverpool went straight up the other end to take the lead through Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.

“The game would have been going in a different direction,” admitted Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp.

“We had to change in the second half. That helped massively and when we are rolling it's difficult to stop.”

Jordan Henderson doubled the European champions' lead with a smart finish on the hour mark.

Salah then produced two cool finishes in the final 20 minutes as Klopp's men took their tally of points to a remarkable 100 from the last possible 102.

Having completed his move from Sporting Lisbon on Thursday, in a deal worth an initial £47 million ($61.2 million), Fernandes went straight into the starting line-up at Old Trafford.

The 25-year-old midfielder delivered a composed display full of neat passing as he lined up behind United striker Anthony Martial and took the role of chief creator.

He kept Rui Patricio on his toes with a series of long-range drives, one of which the Wolves goalkeeper nearly spilled into his own net.

There was also a booking for Fernandes for pulling back Raul Jimenez in the second half of a tame clash that left sixth-placed United without a win in their last three league games.

“Bruno is a top player. It's the first game. Bruno is one of those who, when he gets it into feet, he wants players moving in front of him and we didn't,” United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said.

“We've played so many games in the past few months the players are down to the bare bones. Energy levels are down and we need a break.”

Leicester and Chelsea consolidated their places in the top four in a 2-2 draw at the King Power Stadium.

Fourth-placed Chelsea sit five points clear of fifth-placed Sheffield United and six ahead of United and Wolves.

Frank Lampard's men have won just four of their last 13 league games and needed two goals from centre-back Antonio Rudiger just to claim a point.

“Not many people gave us the top-four slot and I understand why, and it's probably the same now,” Lampard said.

Blades on the rise

All the goals came in the second half as Rudiger nodded Chelsea in front before two goals in 10 minutes from Harvey Barnes and Ben Chilwell turned the game around for Leicester.

A brilliant leap from Rudiger 19 minutes from time denied the Foxes all three points, but Brendan Rodgers' men maintain an eight-point lead over Chelsea in third.

Sheffield United are Chelsea's closest challengers as Chris Wilder's men earned a 1-0 win at Crystal Palace thanks to a calamitous own goal from Eagles goalkeeper Vicente Guaita.

A double for Robert Snodgrass after Issa Diop's opener put West Ham 3-1 up against Brighton at the London Stadium, but the Seagulls fought back through Pascal Gross and Glenn Murray for a point that keeps them two points above the drop zone.

Watford failed to even collect a point after going 2-0 up on Everton through Adam Masina and Roberto Pereyra.

The Hornets switched off from two set-pieces in first half stoppage time to allow Yerry Mina's double to bring Carlo Ancelotti's men level.

Everton then went down to 10 men when Fabian Delph was sent off but snatched all three points through Theo Walcott.

Aston Villa's celebrations at reaching the League Cup final in midweek were short-lived as 10-man Bournemouth held on for a 2-1 win that lifted them up to 16th.

91,2020/02/02,"PSG win big again, but Neymar and Mbappe leave Tuchel irritated","Paris Saint-Germain coach Thomas Tuchel admitted Neymar's latest lavish birthday celebrations were a “distraction” at a key time in the season after the Brazilian helped the Ligue 1 leaders to a 5-0 win over nine-man Montpellier on Saturday.

Neymar, with his hair dyed pink, shook off an injury scare and raged with the match officials while Pablo Sarabia, Angel Di Maria, Kylian Mbappe and Layvin Kurzawa all scored along with a Daniel Congre own goal as PSG went 13 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table.

On Sunday, the Brazilian is set to host a lavish party for his 28th birthday at a Parisian nightclub, despite his team playing again on Tuesday against Nantes.

“It's a distraction, that's clear,” said Tuchel. “I always want to protect my players, and if there are difficult things to talk about I prefer to say them internally.

“These are distractions, and they give the impression we are not serious, not professional. But I don't really want to talk about it because then these things become big issues.”

Neymar warmed up with a shirt bearing the name of Kobe Bryant and the number 24 of the basketball star who was killed in a helicopter crash last weekend.

While Neymar didn't score, having to settle just for one assist, he produced his usual tricks, provoked the opposition, and required lengthy treatment at the end of the first half after appearing to hurt his ribs as he grappled for the ball with Montpellier's Arnaud Souquet.

Unhappy with the some of the treatment reserved for him, Neymar was booked for dissent in the first half and was then caught by television cameras angrily remonstrating in Portuguese with the fourth official in the tunnel at half-time.

Mbappe’s angry behaviour

Tuchel was also forced to answer questions about Mbappe's angry reaction to being taken off midway through the second half, as Edinson Cavani came on for a first appearance since a January move to Atletico Madrid fell through.

“It doesn't look good, but we are not the only club where players react like that,” the coach said.

“This team shows how professional and focused they are every day, but this gives the impression it's not always like that and I'm sad because it's not necessary.

“I explained to him why he came off and that will be that. I always make decisions for sporting reasons. This is football, not tennis, and you have to respect everyone.”

Sarabia was selected ahead of Mauro Icardi and Cavani to start with Mbappe up front, and the former Real Madrid player curled home a fine opener from 22 yards in the eighth minute for his 10th goal of the season.

Montpellier's hopes of getting back into the game were then as good as over when goalkeeper Dimitry Bertaud was sent off in the 17th minute for coming out of his box to stop Mbappe bearing down on goal, only to block the ball with his arm and receive a straight red.

On came young debutant goalkeeper Matis Carvalho and he had to pick the ball out of his net twice before the interval.

Di Maria lifted the ball over him and in to make it 2-0 in the 41st minute, and shortly afterwards Teji Savanier's attempt to clear a Di Maria corner rebounded off the face of defender Congre and in.

After Neymar cooled down at the break, he set up Mbappe to round Carvalho and score his 14th league goal of the season.

Kurzawa drilled in the fifth in the 65th minute, and the visitors were reduced to nine men late on as substitute Joris Chotard saw two quick yellow cards.

92,2020/02/02,I-League | Indian Arrows stuns 10-man East Bengal,"Indian Arrows rode on its captain Vikram Pratap Singh’s 59th-minute stunner to upset a 10-man East Bengal 1-0 in an I-League encounter at the Kalyani Stadium on Saturday.

The superb performance in the development side’s second win might not have changed its position on the table, but it will be a morale booster for the touring youngsters.

EB kept bottom-ranked Arrows under pressure by plotting several moves and earning three of its 12 corners inside the first five minutes.

However, the red-and-gold brigade’s raids did not fetch the desired result due to its forwards’ below-par finishing.

The hard-working Arrows defence, led by goalkeeper Lalbiakhlua Jognte, made it tougher for EB.

Arrows grew in confidence towards the end of the first half and improved its game to put the EB defence under pressure after the switch of ends.

Nikhil Raj passed to Givson Singh, who rolled it on to his right. Vikram shot a sharp one high into the net around the hour mark to put Arrows ahead.

EB showed desperation but could not find the equalizer. It fielded the effective striker, Ansumana Kromah, in 63rd minute. The Liberian netted one within minutes but was marked off-side. In the 85th minute he missed a sitter.

EB, which had 24 shots at the goal, had more embarrassment in store. A frustrated Marcos de la Espada had his second yellow, resulting in a red, in the dying moments before the host suffered its fourth loss. In a sporting gesture, the EB fans cheered the Arrows' boys for their brave show.

93,2020/02/02,ISL | Crivellaro is Chennaiyin’s hero,"There was a flood of goals, nine in all, including a hat-trick by Kerala Blasters captain Bartholomew Ogbeche, at the Nehru Stadium here on Saturday, but it was former two-time champion Chennaiyin FC which walked away a 6-3 winner in the Hero Indian Super League game.

The big win helped the visitors climb a rung to fifth and a step closer to the playoff zone. The game was everything that Chennaiyin coach Owen Coyle had predicted, and it had many stars too. It was Chennaiyin midfielder Rafael Crivellaro who was the star of the show with his brilliant play in the last few minutes of the first half, a period in which the side scored three goals. The Brazilian, whose twisty dancing moves had the Blasters in a tizzy, scored two of them and had a hand in another.

A gift

Chennaiyin’s opening goal, in the 39th minute, was virtually a gift from Blasters goalkeeper T.P. Rehenesh. After receiving a backpass, Rehenesh tapped the ball directly to Crivellaro, the most dangerous man on the night, and the Brazilian was quick to grab the opportunity, pushing it into the empty net. That shattered Rehenesh and appeared to play on his mind for the rest of the game.

Five minutes later, Crivellaro was at it again, swiftly pushing the ball to Lithuanian Nerijus Valskis — the top-scorer this season — even as he was brought down by the central defenders. Valskis produced a bullet of a shot that gave Rehenesh no chance. Valskis finished with two goals while Lallianzuala Chhangte had two too.

Ogbeche pumped in three superb goals in the second half — the first after a soft slide and the next with a fiery shot — but with Crivellaro doing all the damage in the first half, the home captain’s effort proved inadequate.

The result: Kerala Blasters 3 (Bartholomew Ogbeche 48, 65 & 76) lost to Chennaiyin FC 6 (Rafael Crivellaro 39 & 45+1, Nerijus Valskis 45 & 90, Lallianzuala Chhangte 59 & 80).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/u6hb9k/article30716431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02FOOT1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/isl-crivellaro-is-chennaiyins-hero/article30716432.ece

Pressing for a charter of demands, including permanent job opportunities for the residents of Ananthavadi, who have given lands to the Arasu cement factory, they had been refusing mining activities from Ananthavadi mines.

They were particular that they would not allow any mining activity particularly for the newly built ₹809 crore additional plant of Arasu cement. Though the officials Tamil Nadu Cement Corporation Ltd held a couple of rounds of talks with the agitators, they refused to budge. To press their demands, they also surrendered their ration cards to the officials.

To find out an amicable solution, Mr. Sampath held a negotiation with the residents of Ananthavadi at the Collector Office. Besides Government Chief Whip Thamarai S. Rajendhiran, Collector D. Rathna, the residents of Ananthavadi participated in the meeting.

They were defiant in their demands and pressed for permanent jobs to the eligible candidates of the village. The peace talk that began around 3 p.m. came to an end around 9 p.m.

They finally agreed to allow mining after the Industries Minister promised that 57 candidates would be given employment within April. They then got back the ration cards surrendered to the officials.

Mr. Sampath said that the additional plant, recently inaugurated by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, had a capacity to produce 10 lakh tonne of cement a year. As demanded by the villagers, time bound action would be taken on creating medical facilities, smart classrooms, drinking water and better roads in Ananthavadi.

On permanent job opportunities to the candidates of the village, Mr. Sampath said that the villagers were explained about the rules and regulations on offering permanent jobs. However, 30 candidates would be given employment on contract basis within a week, and 27 more candidates would be inducted in Arasu cement factory within April.

100,2020/02/02,‘Make use of technologies to maximise farm output’,"Chief Whip of Tamil Nadu Thamarai S. Rajendhiran on Friday asked farmers of the district to make use of modern technologies to maximise productivity.

Speaking at a function organised by Kisan Vikas Kendra (KVK), Ariyalur, he said the Central and State governments had been implementing various schemes to maximise farm output. It would become easy if farmers adapt to new technologies. They should avail the benefits of government schemes, and technologies from knowledge sources such as KVK and State Agriculture Department. They should also cultivate high-income yielding crops like fruits and vegetables.

Mr. Rajendhiran said the KVK in Ariyalur had taken a new initiative to empower young women become agri entrepreneurs and formed a club “Mahila Youth Techno and Empowerment Club - Agri (MYTEC – Agri)”.

Collector D. Rathna, in her address, said vegetables and fruits were high in nutrition. The demand of vegetables and fruits had gone up due to increasing awareness of including them in menu. Farmers should cultivate fruits and vegetables to make use of the high demand.

101,2020/02/02,Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi gets key party post in Tiruchi,"Days after elevating K.N. Nehru, hitherto Tiruchi South Secretary and party strongman for about three decades, as Principal Secretary, the DMK has appointed Anbil Mahesh Poyyamozhi, a close associate of party president M.K. Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi, to the key post of district secretary (Tiruchi South).

The DMK has created one more unit (Tiruchi Central) by tweaking the jurisdictions of Tiruchi South and North units. In effect, Mr. Poyyamozhi would be stepping into the shoes of Mr. Nehru.

DMK General Secretary K. Anbazhagan said in a statement that Kaduvetti Thyagarajan would be the district secretary for Tiruchi North, and Vairamani for Tiruchi Central. Mr. Nehru had been the strongman of the DMK in Tiruchi since he was made as the district secretary in 1994 replacing (late) N. Selvaraj after he had switched loyalty to MDMK formed by Vaiko after splitting the DMK.

Since then Mr. Nehru has held the post, except a brief period for about two years. An MLA representing Tiruchi west assembly constituency, Mr. Nehru was made a Minister for the first time in 1989. He was inducted in the DMK cabinet led by M. Karunanidhi in 1996 and 2006 too.

Mr. Nehru, who was known for his organisation skills, has conducted many State conferences of the party since he took the baton from Mr. Selvaraj.

The organisational change in Tiruchi DMK has given prominence to Mr. Mahesh Poyyamozhi, son of Mr. Stalin’s close friend, the late Anbil Poyyamozhi.

Representing the DMK in the State assembly from Tiruverumbur constituency, he is often seen along with Mr. Stalin and DMK youth wing secretary Udhayanidhi whenever they tour the State.

Mr. Mahesh is a third generation politician in his family. His grandfather Anbil P. Dharmalingam was known as the 'iron man' of the DMK till his death.

“Though the AIADMK is strong in rural areas of the Tiruchi district, Mr. Nehru had worked hard to capture all panchayat unions and the district panchayat in the recent polls to local bodies in rural parts. The organisation abilities of Mr. Mahesh Poyyamozhi, who is mainly in Chennai, are yet to be tested,” a DMK leader in Tiruchi said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/anbil-mahesh-poyyamozhi-gets-key-party-post-in-tiruchi/article30716994.ece
102,2020/02/02,Coronavirus: Thulukkanviduthi under scanner of health officials,"Thulukkanviduthi hamlet near Peravurani in Thanjavur district is under observation of the district health department following the return of a resident from China after outbreak of coronavirus infection.

Ramachandran, 34, of Thulukkanviduthi, who was working for a project undertaken by a Bengaluru-based company at Shanghai, returned to India after the coronavirus outbreak and arrived at the hamlet on January 30. A team of doctors and para-medical staff came toThulukkanviduthi and screened Ramachandran.

Though there was no sign of the infection on him, the medical team decided to keep him under surveillance for the next one month. He was advised to wash his hands at least 15 times a day and to refrain from mingling with people in the village until he was declared uninfected with corona virus.

An awareness campaign on how to keep coronavirus at bay was also conducted for the villagers, sources said.

Prayers held

Meanwhile, special prayers were performed at Juraharavinayagar shrine at Nageswaran Temple, Kumbakonam, on Friday seeking divine intervention to help people overcome the new virus attack.

103,2020/02/02,Budget 2020 evokes mixed reactions in central region,"The Union Budget 2020 has evoked mixed reactions from representatives of industry, aviation and farming sectors.

Secretary of Tiruchi District Tiny and Small Scale Industries' Association S. Gopalakrishnan expressed happiness over the assurance given in Budget 2020 for extending the time limit by a year for MSME units to settle their loans with banks.

Likewise, the encouragement to MSME sector to get into export activities and additional sanction of ₹3,000 crore for developing skills were steps in right direction. However, the absence of any announcement on reducing GST rates for the MSME sector was disappointing, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said.

New airports

The promise made by the Finance Minister to develop 100 new airports by 2024 would give a fillip to the UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik) scheme for regional connectivity, M.A. Aleem, Advisory Committee Member, Tiruchi International Airport, said.

Likewise, the announcement for doubling the fleet strength of aircrafts to 1,200 by 2024 would also be of immense utility to the general public, Mr. Aleem said.

Secretary of Consumer Protection Council S. Pushpavanam, said the budget attempted to spur growth. Corporate tax pegged at 15% would spur investments and attract FDI. But, the projection of 10% growth in economy without proper action-based plan was amounted to wishful thinking.

‘Inadequate allotment’

Allotments to railways for safety and from reserve fund were inadequate. There would be a requirement of ₹50 lakh crore to complete the sanctioned projects up to 2030, Mr. Pushpavanam said.

Clarity on new tax rates on individual income would emerge only after comparison with the old method of calculation, he added.

While welcoming the announcements on allocation of ₹15 lakh crore for farm loans, and credit card with ₹1 lakh withdrawal limit, and specific loan schemes for women agriculturists, Puliyur Nagarajan, president of the Tiruchi district farmers unit of Tamil Maanila Congress, expressed disappointment over the silence of the Centre on waiver of farm loans, and inter-linking of rivers in Tamil Nadu.

State president of Thamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam P.R. Pandian said the Union Budget had disappointed the ryots who were expecting loan waiver announcement in view of the crop loss they had suffered from 2012 to 2019. Absence of any announcement relating to linking of rivers had also disappointed the ryots.

While welcoming the proposal to involve women self-help groups in the proposed village storage scheme, National Organiser, Self Sufficient Green Villages Movement, Arupathy P. Kalyanam opined that the current Bbdget was nothing but an extension of last year’s budget.

V. Jeevakumar, district vice-president, Agriculture Labour Union, Thanjavur District, said though some new initiatives such as ‘kisan rail’ had been announced, silence over the minimum support price and poor implementation of ‘kisan samman’ scheme announced in the last budget had disappointed the farmers.

Terming the budget as an exercise lacked in creation of job opportunities, R. Palanivelu. Professor, Department of Economics, AVVM Pushpam College, Poondi, welcomed the increase in insurance cover for bank customers.

The reduction in income tax slab rates had not fulfilled the expectations of the salaried class and middle income group, according to Mr. Palanivelu.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/budget-2020-evokes-mixed-reactions-in-central-region/article30716992.ece

107,2020/02/02,Exchange of ideas at Open House,"The first-ever Open House, an interactive session between the readers and the senior editors of The Hindu, in the city was witness to an exchange of ideas related to news coverage of certain issues and the all-pervasive social media and its impact.

Convened by the Readers’ Editor, A.S. Panneerselvan, readers of all age groups took part in the event and showered praise as well as criticism on the paper. The Editor of The Hindu, Suresh Nambath, interacted with the readers.

Senior IAS officer Adusumilli V. Rajamouli, who attended the event with his father A. Venkata Ramabrahmam and son A. Venkatarama Lalithanand as readers of The Hindu, said they were thankful to the newspaper which groomed them.

“My concern for future generations is how to preserve this and take it forward. The newspaper may introduce more editions on the lines of Sunday magazine to which youth are attracted to. Secondly, the newspaper may come up with an app that offers condensed content to grasp on the go,” Mr. Rajamouli said.

On behalf of senior citizens, Mr. Rajamouli highlighted the need for coverage of their issues and suggested a special page with a large font as a good part of the newspaper’s readers were senior citizens.

Former professor Duggaraju Srinivasa Rao, a reader of The Hindu since 1965, felt that the newspaper was unnecessarily giving extensive coverage to anti-CAA protests. Mr. Panneerselvan and Mr. Nambath said that the newspaper was only against discrimination based on religion and persecution should not be the only criteria.

On social media

“Today, everybody is there on social media. Our mothers force us to read newspapers. How is social media impacting newspapers,” asked a school student.

Mr. Nambath replied that The Hindu always adapted to changes in the media industry scenario. “The Hindu is the first newspaper to have an online edition in the country. Today it is available on all digital platforms and devices,” he said.

Mr. Nambath said the newspaper's mobile app had special features of adjusting font, personalised home screen and read-aloud for the content to be readout.

Referring to Saturday’s edition of The Hindu, Md. Ahmed, a student asked the editors why the news of India’s victory in T20, which was positive (attractive and inspiring) news, could not be published on the first page instead of just political news. In contrast, another school student questioned why cricket was being given so much importance in the sports pages.

Mr. Nambath informed them that the newspaper extensively covers badminton, tennis, and other sports as well and most of the readers were interested in cricket.

Acting Resident Editor of the newspaper in the State, Appaji Reddem explained how the report on IIT Madras’ study on Amaravati was accessed and published.

Mr. Nambath told the readers that all the suggestions would be taken seriously by the editorial team.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/so805n/article30718194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02ONGHINDUTWO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/exchange-of-ideas-at-open-house/article30718195.ece

CEO of Maple Software and former A.P. CII chairman G.S. Shiv Kumar said the new Income-Tax regime would help the middle income groups. He said that companies need not pay Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT), which would lead to infusion of fresh funds.

Divestment target

He said 15% tax rebate for new power generation companies would help increase investment in the power sector and availability of power. He welcomed the decision to double the divestment target to ₹2.1 trillion from the next fiscal. He said statement on ‘no tolerance to tax harassment’ was industry-friendly.

Entrepreneur and former president of the Vizagapatam Chamber of Commerce & Industry A.V. Monish Row said there were a few welcome announcements, but the outlays and source of funds were to be seen. The government was depending on the PPP mode for many of its schemes. Though there was some reduction in direct taxes, the GST remained unchanged, he said.

‘Credibility gap’

“Fewer than 17% of India’s graduates are readily employable, and 100 million will need to be educated in the next decade requiring 50,000 colleges. While there is no magic bullet to pull India out of the present economic mess, the Union Government will require more honesty in recognising the issues and gaining trust of the investors,” he added.

“A huge credibility gap exists and needs to be fixed not just by talk but by demonstrable action,” he remarked.

Mr. Row said the budget did not show any seriousness, which was disappointing.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/fn7xko/article30718437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VJPG4-PORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/union-budget-proposal-to-corporatise-major-ports-hailed/article30718438.ece
110,2020/02/02,GVMC starts Night Bazaar at Old Jail Road,"The Urban Community Development (UCD) wing of the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has come up with Night Bazaar, a dedicated hawkers zone involving number of licensed food trucks at Old Jail Road, opposite to Women’s Degree College, here on Saturday.

The bazaar was inaugurated by Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Botcha Satyanarayana. Speaking on the occasion, he said, “To begin with we will have food courts and later handicrafts and DWCRA stalls will also come up.”

The bazaar will be open to public from 6 p.m. till 2 a.m., to meet midnight cravings of food lovers. As an additional attraction, a large screen has been arranged at the spot for the public, where cricket matches, movies and songs will be screened.

It may be noted that a group of street vendors, food trucks have been already been running a food zone at the Old Jail Rod area which is open till 10.30 p.m. Giving it a new look, the GVMC has created dedicated spaces to the food stalls. Proper parking facility and seating has also been arranged. Wide varieties of food right from idly, dosa, fast-foods like noodles, fried rice, Shawarmas, momo’s, biryanies, lassi stalls have been arranged.

According to Project Director, UCD, GVMC, Y. Srinivas Rao, the motto of the Night Bazaar is to provide dedicated zone to food trucks or vendors and also to provide a good hangout spot for food lovers from the city with wide varieties of food.

“Many a time people suffer due to unavailability of food late at night. But our food zone will be open till early hours. We have cleared parking issues at that spot and facilitated a large screen, where families can come together and enjoy,” he added.

Mr. Srinivasa Rao also added that right now 27 food stalls will be available, soon the GVMC would give permission to another 63 street vendors. The plan is to have 90 stalls at this place.

“While returning from a second show movie, if at all we feel hungry, we had to go to railway station. Such ‘Night Bazaars’ was a long-pending dream for Vizagites and we are happy about this initiative,” said G.

115,2020/02/02,Data | Budget 2020: What's hindering India's infrastructure push?,"In December last year, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman outlined plans to invest about ₹102 lakh crore on infrastructure projects by 2024-25. The five-year-long National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) will enter its second year in FY21, during which ₹1,950,397 crores are to be invested. The ambitious plan with a massive budget is getting bogged down by time delays and cost-overruns across many projects.

Infrastructure push

About ₹19.5 lakh crore has been budgeted during FY21 as part of the NIP. Urban infrastructure, road transport, energy and Railways account for about 70% of allocation this year. Graph shows % allocation under the NIP for FY21.

Time and cost overruns

Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation analyses 1,676 projects around the country and reports time and cost overruns every quarter. At the end of quarter 2 of FY20, more than one-third of infrastructure projects were delayed and the overall original cost estimation of those projects had been overrun by 20%. Graph captures captures the cost overruns as a % of original estimates (blue line, left-axis) and % of projects with time overruns (red line, right-axis).

The graph shows that both time and cost overruns were relatively high around 2014 and gradually became better in the next few years. But, in FY19 and FY20 it has gone up again, thereby bogging down India's infrastructure push.

Sectoral comparison

While the Railways and power sectors saw high allocation in the National Infrastructure Pipeline, a high share of ongoing infra projects in these sectors has been delayed as of Q2FY20. Graph shows cost overruns as a % of original estimates against % of projects with time overruns as of November 2019. Each circle denotes a sector.

117,2020/02/02,"Budget 2020 | I appear conservative, but I want to be realistic, says Nirmala Sitharaman","A day after presenting her second budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in an interaction with presspersons, said the government’s focus was on pulling the economy up from its present slowdown by investing in infrastructure and asset creation that will generate jobs.

You said inflation is well-behaved and the economy’s fundamentals are robust, but have assumed a conservative 10% nominal growth. The 15th Finance Commission had assumed an 11% nominal growth for the year. The Economic Survey also sees a more optimistic real GDP growth to rebound to 6-6.5% in 2020-21…

The Economic Survey gives a lot of ideas and their assessment of the growth for the coming year. The Ministry has also been conscious of the specific progress made between the last budget in July and now. Given today’s environment where public spending is being used more as an engine for pulling the economy up, my focus will be on spending focused on creation of assets.

Infrastructure spending has a larger cascading effect. Revenue generation on the other hand, has suffered due to different circumstances. So if I look at this extreme that is not growing and that extreme which demands more for me, I will have to be realistic in the number that I can reach. Therefore, I appear conservative but I want to be realistic.

There is a fear that there will be lower investments in insurance and equity-linked savings schemes under the new lower tax rates regime, where exemptions for those are withdrawn

Today, in a country where you’ve moved out of this socialist model of governing your economy, opened up stock options, opened and proved that the bond market is also attracting retail investors, why cannot you trust the individual? It is he or she who has to take a call on, ‘I have this much money in my hand, I will go buy a vehicle or I will take 50% of it for the first instalment towards buying a house.’ It is up to them. This command-driven economy, where we incentivise going that route, no longer checks. I tend to believe that this incentive alone is not the reason for a person to consider insuring himself. He’s got to have his priority towards insurance and that’s his choice. So I don't think it will have a bearing. And if it does have a bearing, now the options are open, it will only go towards something else which is also going to help the economy and be a catalyst for more economic activity.

They can put it in mutual funds, buy bonds, that’s triggering a lot more activity.

There is also some concern about the TDS introduced on mutual fund dividends and capital gains for resident Indians.

First of all, TDS is reconcilable with your taxation itself, so you can offset if it can be accommodated within the fair tax that you have to eventually pay. So that’s not an additional tax.

During the last Budget, you had meetings with stakeholders and withdrawn the super-rich surcharge. If the market falls again on Monday (after Saturday’s 2.43% fall in the Sensex), will you again meet with stakeholders to see if there is a need to withdraw something?

That’s a very legitimate question to ask, but let us see what the markets are going to do.

You referred to the Harappan texts in your speech, which has led to some confusion, as people say the script has not been deciphered.

Deciphering of the hieroglyphs of Harappa has happened. You may want to interpret it in one particular fashion and I may want to interpret it in a different fashion, but on the deciphering, there is no dispute. The dispute may be did they come from anywhere else or are they natives to India. I'm not getting into that.

The Survey and the Budget talk of wealth creation and trust, and you are betting on a huge infrastructure boost. Late Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had talked about a reboot of the public private partnership framework in India in his first Budget, but nothing came of that. Could this be an opportune time to revisit PPPs?

I don’t know if you missed it. In every step that I announced, where I clearly recognise the role of the Centre and States working together or a central agency like the Railways looking at doing something more efficiently, we are all looking at PPPs models.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/3hos73/article30721010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03NIRMALASITHARAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/i-appear-conservative-but-i-want-to-be-realistic-nirmala/article30721011.ece
118,2020/02/02,Budget 2020 | Budget boosts business confidence but not consumer sentiments,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented a Budget that was directionally sound but may not expeditiously revive the Indian economy.

The Budget has boosted business confidence for India Inc. through various measures, including the proposal for a tax payers’ charter to prevent harassment by officials, increasing the investment limit of foreign portfolio investors (FPI) in corporate bonds, allowing sovereign wealth funds to invest in infrastructure and making the Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) applicable to individuals instead of companies.

However, the Budget may not move the needle in terms of boosting consumption spending as the reduction in tax rates will not increase disposable income in the hands of the salaried middle class when exemptions are being withdrawn. Transferring DDT to recipients will also take money out of the hands of the retail investor.

So, while it’s true that the Budget will improve business sentiments, investments by India Inc. may take a few years to kick in, thus postponing economic recovery and the timelines for achieving a $5-trillion Indian economy.

What was heartening about this Budget were the investments announced towards harnessing the potential of Science & Technology for developing the kind of future technologies that will enable India to take a leadership position globally.

The five-year Rs 8,000 cr outlay for a National Mission on Quantum Technologies is a very important investment with huge future returns as it will advance our computational and analytical capabilities and enable us to join an exclusive global league of nations harnessing this futuristic technology.

At present, India lacks a reliable genetic information bank for research. Therefore, the proposal to create a comprehensive genetic database will be critical for next-generation medicine, agriculture and for bio-diversity management.

Technology and big data analytics can make research and development more efficient by analysing billions of datasets. This will now get a boost thanks to the FM’s proposed policy for setting up data centre parks throughout the country and the provision of ₹6,000 crore for BharatNet in FY21.

Giving Startups a Helping Hand

This Budget offered incentives to strengthen the existing startup ecosystem by increasing the turnover limit for startups to claim tax exemption from ₹25 crore to ₹100 crore and for up to a period of 10 years from incorporation as opposed to 7 years earlier. It also recommended a five-year tax holiday on ESOPs.

Healthcare

The good health of the nation is essential for economic progress. The rollout of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in 2018 by the NDA government was a big step towards introducing universal healthcare coverage in our country. The expansion of health infrastructure in tier II and III cities via PPP model and upskilling of healthcare personnel will strengthen the Ayushman Bharat program. The use of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence for preventive healthcare along with increasing the number of Jan Aushadhi Kendras will take forward the government’s agenda of healthcare for all.

Education

The allocation of Rs 99,300 crore for education and Rs 3,000 crore for skill development in FY21 is also a welcome step as is the proposal to attract external commercial borrowing and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the education sector.

Rural Economy

Boosting rural consumption required the government to increase its expenditure on various schemes. While the Budget had a slew of measures for the agricultural economy, the outlay for the non-agricultural rural sector increased to Rs 1.23 trillion compared to Rs 1.17 trillion last year.

Final Analysis

The measures announced in this Budget can give returns in the medium to long-term. However, we need to make sure that they are implemented fast to have the necessary impact.

119,2020/02/02,Budget 2020 | An act of walking the tight rope,"While the government is walking a tightrope with respect to fiscal deficit, especially due to corporate tax cuts, despite higher receipts from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), there was a case for a fiscal stimulus expected in the Budget, as the RBI has called for in the recent policy statement.

The government acknowledged its fiscal challenges, resorting to the escape clauses in the FRBM [Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act] — pushing up the deficit to 3.8% in FY20 and 3.5% in FY21 — with total expenditure increase by 13% (higher increase in capex) resulting in incremental improvements across sectors.

While continuing to remain committed to the doubling of farmer’s income, the government has laid out a longer term plan for the agricultural sector, detailing 16 broad initiatives that would help achieve the government’s objective. The government’s move to make the sector market oriented through contract farming, land leases etc., provides a positive push to this sector. The government’s recognition of the importance of non-farm activities and their role in enhancing farmers’ income is a welcome move. However, the lower allocation for the MNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) compared to the Revised Estimates may not be par for the course.

The change in SARFAESI (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002) norms for debt recovery for the NBFC (non-banking finance company) sector could aid in improving recoveries and help ease some of the stress in this sector. With the recent challenges in the cooperative banking sector and increasing uncertainty amongst the depositor community, the government’s move to increase deposit guarantee to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh will help restore some calm.

The decision of the 15th Finance Commission to keep the net proceeds of the Union Government’s tax pool unchanged at 42% to the States bodes well with the government’s agenda of cooperative federalism.

The changes made in personal income tax space may reduce the tax burden of a large section of the taxpayers. However, the options need to be weighed against each other to understand the new scheme’s attractiveness.

Overall, having taken cognisance of the challenges in the economy, the government has laid out its focus areas and policy direction, which could help in navigating through these challenging times. However, as with any policy, execution is the true measure of success.

120,2020/02/02,Govt. pegs UIDAI’s allocation at ₹985 crore for FY21,"The government has raised fund allocation for the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) — which issues biometric ID to residents — by 17% to ₹985 crore for the next fiscal starting April 1.

In the current fiscal, the UIDAI was originally allocated ₹1,227 crore when the Modi-2.0 government presented the Union Budget on July 5, 2019. But the amount was revised downwards to ₹836.7 crore, according to Budget 2020-21 documents.

The document did not provide reasons for the downward revision but it could be because of non-utilisation of all the funds allocated to the UIDAI.

The UIDAI is the nodal body for Aadhaar, an identity infrastructure for delivery of various social welfare programmes and effective targeting of these services.

In December 2019, the UIDAI had said that 125 crore residents of India have Aadhaar, the 12-digit unique identity number.

“The achievement comes along with the rapidly increasing use of Aadhaar as the primary identity document by the Aadhaar holders. This is evident from the fact that Aadhaar-based authentication services have been used close to 37,000 crore times since inception,” it had then said.

The UIDAI receives about 3 crore authentication requests every day. Also, it receives about 3-4 lakh Aadhaar update requests daily.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tjmrh8/article25046636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Aadhaar,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/govt-pegs-uidais-allocation-at-985-crore-for-fy21/article30719323.ece
121,2020/02/02,"Budget 2020 | Money earned in India by NRIs will be taxed, says Nirmala Sitharaman","Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday scotched fears that provisions introduced in the Budget would bring Indian workers’ income in zero tax jurisdictions, like the UAE, into the Indian tax net.

The Finance Bill has proposed three major changes to prevent tax abuse by citizens that don’t pay taxes anywhere in the world — reducing the number of days that an Indian citizen can be granted non-resident status for tax purposes from 182 to 120; citizens who don’t pay taxes anywhere will be deemed to be a resident; and the definition of ‘not ordinarily resident’ has been tightened.

“Let’s say an NRI, living in Dubai or elsewhere, is not taxed for his income there, but has some earnings through something in India for which he doesn't pay tax here. We are saying, for that income which is generated in India, pay a tax,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

Alarmed by the possible implications of the new provisions, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, recording the State’s strong disagreement over the Budget provision as it will hurt Indians working in the Middle East ‘who toil and bring foreign exchange to the country’ through remittances.

“The new provision is being interpreted to create an impression that those Indians who are bonafide workers in other countries, including in Middle East, and who are not liable to tax in these countries, will be taxed in India on the income that they have earned there. This interpretation is not correct,” the Finance Ministry said in a statement.

The Ministry will incorporate a clarification, if required, into the law so that only income derived from an Indian business or profession will be taxable for such citizens, the Finance Minister said.

Responding to criticism that the lower tax rates for those earning upto ₹15 lakh a year wouldn’t necessarily lead to tax savings, once the withdrawal of exemptions and deductions on the existing tax rates is factored in, Ms. Sitharaman said the Ministry will issue more clarifications on the matter.

“There are a few exemptions which we allow under the new rates too. I believe that many of the calculations which have come out in the newspapers today have probably not taken those on board into account,” she said.

Later, officials said less than 10% of taxpayers claim deductions of over ₹2 lakh in their tax filings. Therefore, comparing the old and new tax rates, assuming deductions in the range of ₹4 lakh to ₹5 lakh may be erroneous. In fact, a meagre 3.77 lakh out of 5.78 crore tax filers have claimed deductions exceeding ₹4 lakh in 2018-19, they pointed out.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/drehpp/article30712773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FINANCEBUDGETRVMOORTHY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-money-earned-in-india-by-nris-will-be-taxed-says-nirmala-sitharaman/article30719238.ece
122,2020/02/02,Cess on imported medical devices to lead to cost escalation for patients: Medical Technology Association of India,"The Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI), that represents mainly research-based medical technology companies, has said the cess imposed by the government on medical devices will lead to increase in cost of imported products and reduce affordability of healthcare.

This is against the basic ethos of Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) wherein government wants to provide affordable healthcare for all, MTaI said.

“A 5% cess on custom duties for import has been imposed on medical devices in the budget which will increase the cost of the imported medical devices. Ultimately patients will bear this cost and affordability will decrease,” MTaI Director Sanjay Bhutani said in a statement.

This is a retrograde measure and goes against global companies which provide more than 80 per cent of critical care medical devices as well as the patient who gets exposed to the danger of smuggling of these low bulk and high value devices, without service & legal guarantees from neighbouring countries where the tariffs are already lower, he added.

“The domestic self-sufficiency argument of the government also needs to be taken with a grain of salt. We do hope the government has not looked at the classes of products, on which it plans to impose this cess, monolithically. As many sub categories of these classes would not be manufactured in India at all,” Mr. Bhutani said.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday proposed to impose a nominal health cess on import of medical equipment to boost domestic medical devices sector and generate resources for health services.

“To achieve the twin objectives of giving impetus to the domestic industry and also to generate resource for health services, I propose to impose a nominal health cess, by way of a duty of customs, on the imports of medical equipment keeping in view that these goods are now being made significantly in India,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

The Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMeD) also expressed disappointment and anguish over the Union Budget giving cold shoulder again to Indian medical device industry.

“This year FM announces taxation will drive public healthcare funding but the fine print states it as cess so if duty on a device was 5% it becomes 5.25% effectively. Only a meagre increase of 0.25% to protect domestic manufacturing and motivate traders to become manufacturers,” AiMeD Forum Coordinator Rajiv Nath said.

AiMeD was expecting the government to move forward on promised reforms and anticipated conducive measures to boost domestic manufacturing of medical devices, he added.

“It is frustrating that against our expectations, the government has not included any measures to help end the 80-90 per cent import dependence forced upon us and an ever increasing import bill of over ₹38,837 crore and promoting growth of Indian medical device industry,” Mr. Nath said.

Though the health cess of 5% on import of medical equipment will augment resources for funding of expenditure on healthcare sector, the hike will increase the cost of equipment, which is a near term negative for the players, ICRA Corporate Ratings Group Head & Senior VP Shubham Jain said.

“At ₹67,484 crore, the budgetary allocation for healthcare sector for FY2021 will translate into modest 5.7% increase vis-vis revised estimate of₹63,830 crore for FY2020. With a nominal estimated GDP growth of 10%, this also translates into a fall in the public healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP,” he added.

Thus, the public sector spend on healthcare will continue to lag at below around 1.5% of GDP, Mr. Jain said.

“Nonetheless, the proposal to set up hospitals in PPP mode in 112 districts is likely to encourage the much-needed investments in the sector,” he added.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nfyjse/article30709912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/budgetdocs,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/cess-on-imported-medical-devices-to-lead-to-cost-escalation-for-patients-medical-technology-association-of-india/article30719141.ece
123,2020/02/02,"TDS on on e-commerce transactions: Amazon, Flipkart may approach government for clarification on Budget 2020 proposal","Amazon India and Flipkart are studying the Budget proposal on levy of 1% TDS, and will reach out to the government for clarifications.

“We are studying the details, and will reach out to the government for clarifications. We hope the tax regime is simple and uniform so that millions of small and medium businesses can go online, digitise their operations and continue to contribute to growing the economy,” an Amazon India spokesperson said in response to an e-mailed query.

Flipkart also said it was going through the proposal.

“We are studying the details, particularly how it impacts the MSMEs and Sellers on our marketplace platform. We will discuss further with our seller partners, and engage with government and other stakeholders in due course,” Flipkart said in its response.

The government on Saturday proposed a new levy of 1% TDS (tax deducted at source) on e-commerce transactions, a move that could increase burden on sellers on such platforms.

“In order to widen and deepen the tax net by bringing participants of e-commerce (sellers) within tax net, it is proposed to insert a new section 194-O in the Act so as to provide for a new levy of TDS at the rate of one per cent,” according to Budget 2020-21 documents.

The amendments will take effect from April 1, 2020.

The documents said the e-commerce operator — an entity owning, operating or managing the digital platform —will have to deduct 1% TDS on the gross amount of sales or service or both. This provision will not apply in cases where the seller’s gross amount of sales during the previous year through e-commerce operator is less than ₹5 lakh and the seller has furnished his PAN or Aadhaar number.

An industry expert said the move will reduce cash flow for sellers as cash will be stuck with government in refund system. Given that many sellers are micro, small and medium enterprises, it would add pressure on them.

BookMyShow Head (Finance) Mitesh Shah said compliance on e-commerce has been increased by mandating them to deduct a TDS of 1% on all goods and services sold on e-commerce platforms.

“This would be in addition to TCS (tax collected at source) under GST (goods and services tax) and this amendment might further increase the cost of compliance for e-commerce companies,” he added.

A senior industry executive, who did not wish to be named, said levying the one per cent TDS on ‘sales proceeds net of commission, shipping fees, listing fees etc’ would have been more beneficial than the current proposal of the levy being imposed on gross sale.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/eimuds/article30715727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02ECOM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/tds-on-on-e-commerce-transactions-amazon-flipkart-may-approach-government-for-clarification-on-budget-2020-proposal/article30718843.ece
124,2020/02/02,Indian Budget will attract more FDI: U.S. industry leaders,"The 2020-21 Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will improve the ease of doing business in India and attract more Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), U.S. industry leaders have said.

Presenting her second Budget in Parliament on Saturday, Ms. Sitharaman offered tax breaks to foreign investors and specifically those like sovereign wealth funds who are willing to place a long-term bet on the economy.

She said the Budget was aimed at boosting incomes and enhancing purchasing power, stressing that the economy’s fundamentals were strong and inflation was well contained.

Despite a slowdown in growth, the global outlook for investment in India remains strong and therefore the budget was a great opportunity to convert the global sentiment into action, said Mukesh Aghi, president of US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF).

Complimenting Ms. Sitharaman for taking measures to boost investment in infrastructure sector, including digital, Mr. Aghi said the USISPF believed that the budget could have gone further to liberalise sectors such as insurance that are in need of capital.

On ease of doing business, measures such as simplified GST returns, no audit requirement for MSMEs with up to ₹5 crore turnover, instant issuance of PAN by furnishing Aadhaar, pre-filing of tax returns, faceless appeals and assessments will further enhance India’s image from an ease of doing business perspective. Together, these steps show that India’s tax policy is moving in the right direction, Aghi said.

Noting that e-commerce is a bright spot of the Indian economy and expected to touch $84 billion by 2021, Mr. Aghi urged the government to reconsider its decision to impose 1% TDS on e-commerce.

This creates differential treatment of sellers on these platforms and the burden will be ultimately passed on to the consumers, he said.

Welcoming the Budget, the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC) said that abolition of the dividend distribution tax (DDT) removes a major disincentive to foreign companies seeking to set up operations in India.

The Finance Minister has taken solid steps to increase foreign investment and boost Make in India, it said.

The announcement on formulating a scheme to encourage electronics manufacture and adapt it for making medical devices is a welcome move, USIBC said, adding the council had made a recommendation in this regard to the finance minister before the budget.

The decision would result in increased manufacturing in India leading to higher adoption rate for medical electronic equipment due to increased exports and cost-effective production, it said.

While the USIBC hoped to see an increase in the foreign direct investment (FDI) allowance for the insurance sector in the budget proposal, “we look forward to continued engagement with the government on reforms that are needed to bring fresh investment in a critical sector,” the Council said.

Recognizing that India is operating under fiscal constraints, the council continues to advocate for greater investment of resources to modernize India’s defence industry and shore up the auto manufacturing sector, a critical driver of India’s growth.

Terming the budget as an all-inclusive, growth-oriented and transformative budget, Karun Rishi, President of USA India Chamber of Commerce, said it underlined the Indian government’s intent towards building a strong foundation for achieving the goal of making India a USD 5 trillion economy by 2025.

The Budget has unveiled a series of far-reaching reforms, aimed at energizing the Indian economy through a combination of short, medium and long-term measures, he said.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has given a massive boost to business confidence and entrepreneurship in the country. The much needed National Logistic Policy will benefit trade, business, and generate employment.

125,2020/02/02,"LIC IPO may come in 2nd half of FY21, says Finance Secretary","Listing of insurance behemoth Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) may be done in the second half of the next financial year, Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar said on Sunday.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while presenting the Budget 2020-21 on Saturday announced stake sale in LIC through an initial public offer in the next fiscal.

Also read: Union Budget: LIC staff stage protest against disinvestment plan

There are a number of processes which have to be followed for the listing and some legislative changes would also be required for the listing of LIC, Mr. Kumar said.

“We will follow the extant procedure for listing and for other things including the legislative changes it requires in consultation with the Ministry of Law and that process we already started ... listing in the second half of FY21 seems logical,” he said.

Listing of LIC will bring in greater transparency, public participation and also deepen the equity market, he told PTI in an interaction.

Asked about the quantum of dilution, Mr. Kumar said, it could be 10% but no decision has been taken so far.

The government aims to garner ₹90,000 crore from the listing of LIC and stake dilution in IDBI Bank in the next fiscal out of total disinvestment target of ₹2.10 lakh crore.

The government currently owns 100% in LIC, while it holds around a 46.5% stake in IDBI Bank.

“Listing of companies on stock exchanges discipline a company and provides access to financial markets and unlocks its value. It also gives opportunity for retail investors to participate in the wealth so created. The government now proposes to sell a part of its holding in LIC by way of Initial Public Offer (IPO),” the Finance Minister had said in her Budget speech.

Market participants are quite bullish about LIC and said it could be “IPO of the decade” akin to the Saudi Aramco listing.

The 60-year-old state-owned firm, LIC, is the country’s largest insurer, controlling more than 70 per cent of the market share. The insurer has a market share of 76.28% in number of policies and 71% in first-year premiums.

LIC has many subsidiaries including IDBI Bank.

126,2020/02/02,Budget 2020 | Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget booster falls short of expectations,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s second Budget speech on February 1 sought to make up in length and breadth for what it couldn’t deliver in the form of an effective stimulus for India’s fast-slowing economy.

Interspersed with some feel-good decisions such as lower personal income tax rates and a hike in the deposit insurance cover for bank depositors (from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh) were some bold decisions like listing the Life Insurance Corporation of India and abolishing the Dividend Distribution Tax.

A caring society

Ms. Sitharaman expounded on three themes — Aspirational India (a better life for all), Economic Development for all (yielding more space for the private sector) and creating a Caring Society — in her record-breaking speech of more than two and a half hours, aimed at boosting incomes and purchasing power. Inflation, she said, was well-contained and the economy’s fundamentals remained strong. Falling oil prices may help India, but several domestic and global headwinds remain, including the on-going coronavirus scare, that the Budget didn’t touch upon.

To boost farm incomes and the rural sectors, the Finance Minister allocated ₹2.83 lakh crore and fixed ₹15 lakh crore target for agriculture credit. Another ₹1.7 lakh crore spending was planned for transport infrastructure and ₹40,740 crore allocation was made for the energy sector. To boost farmer incomes (to be doubled by 2022 as per the government’s timeline), 16 new and renewed measures were put forth.

The allocation will mean the government will miss its deficit target for the third year in a row, pushing shortfall to 3.8% of GDP in the current fiscal as compared to 3.3% previously planned. The fiscal deficit target for the coming fiscal year starting April 1 has been fixed at 3.5%.

Watch | Highlights of Union Budget 2020-21

Taking a cue from the Economic Survey, which dwelt at length on India’s ancient economic prowess, Ms. Sitharaman cited the guilds of Saraswati-Sindhu civilisation and the Harappan seals (of 3300 BCE) and commerce and trade-related words deciphered from Indus hieroglyphs that show India has been rich in skills and trade for millennia.

The Minister also accepted the Survey’s call for loosening fiscal strings, taking a 0.5% deviation from fiscal deficit targets under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management law to end 2019-20 with a 3.8% deficit and a promise to attain a 3.5% deficit in the coming year.

But the breach may not deliver much bang for the buck and the numbers may be hard to meet, economists reckon.

The Survey’s suggestion for a more aggressive approach to disinvestment was heard too, with a massive target of ₹2.1 lakh crore — 223% higher than the revised estimates for the current year. Any slip ups on this front would make the deficit target untenable.

The Budget deferred taxes for ESOPs in the hands of employees which will be an important decision for the employees to own shares in the employer without getting worried about organising cash to pay taxes. This will also provide greater flexibility to the employers and employees in the structuring of their employment prospects.

One proposal that could be contentious was tax being imposed on Indian citizens abroad if they are not taxable in their home country.

More borrowings

Proposed market borrowings for the coming year have been raised to ₹5.36 lakh crore, following a ₹26,000 crore hike in this year’s borrowing plan from ₹4.73 lakh crore to ₹4.99 lakh crore.

The impact of lower tax rates on demand creation may not be too high, and removing tax exemptions that spur financial savings could dent an already falling savings rate. Ms. Sitharaman expects 10% nominal GDP growth in 2020-21, which suggests she doesn’t share the Survey’s optimism about returning to 6%-6.5% real GDP growth. The 15th Finance Commission, whose report was tabled in Parliament on Saturday, expects 11% nominal growth in 2020-21.

Stockmarket veterans saw no significant growth boost in the Budget, with the Sensex closing nearly 2.43% down or 988 points to close below 40,000 points.

“Today being a Saturday, I’m not sure if every aspect of the stock market is open today,” said Ms. Sitharaman in response to the stock market collapse. I think that many of the things we’ve said in the Budget would definitely have a positive impact on the stock market. I will reserve my comments till Monday.”

129,2020/02/02,Vinod Shukla bags first Mathrubhumi Book of the Year award,"Noted Hindi poet-novelist and Sahitya Akademi honouree Vinod Kumar Shukla has bagged the inaugural Mathrubhumi Book of the Year award for his translated book “Blue Is Like Blue“.

The stories in “Blue Is Like Blue”, translated into English by Arvind Krishna Mehrotra and Sara Rai, deal with common people and their daily struggles.

His book, published under HarperCollins India’s translations imprint Harper Perennial, beat Ib’s Endless Search for Satisfaction (Roshan Ali); The City and the Sea (Raj Kamal Jha); A Secret History of Compassion (Paul Zachariah); The Far Field (Madhuri Vijay); The Scent of God (Saikat Majumdar) and There is Gunpowder in the Air (Manoranjan Byapari).

The award, given to the best fictional work released in the previous year, carries a cash prize of Rs 5 lakh, a plaque designed by Riyas Komu and a certificate.

This year’s jury comprised Shashi Tharoor, Chandrashekhara Kambara and Sumana Roy.

The award was presented at the Mathrubhumi International Festival of Letters 2020 which concluded here on Sunday.

This is the second award for this book, the previous being the Atta Galatta Bangalore Literature Festival Book Prize 2019 for best fiction.

The characters in these stories live in rented accommodation, often in single rooms, where one electric bulb does for light. When the light dims because of low voltage, it is like air escaping from a punctured bicycle tube. There’s a nail to hang clothes from and a wall-to-wall string for the washing.

When the clothes are dry, the character places the carefully folded shirt under a pillow and lies down to sleep. Money is a concern, but the bazaar is the place to go and spend time in, especially if the character has nothing to buy.

The fear that you may be overcharged accompanies every transaction, but joy is not entirely absent.

“Blue Is Like Blue” also includes Shukla’s memoir “Old Veranda”, which sheds light on the childhood and influences of this famously reclusive writer and has this unforgettable scene - a bus bound for Rajnandgaon, the city of his birth, travelling ‘through the air at great speed’

According to the translators, Mr. Shukla is a frugal storyteller; he can make, and make do, with very little.

By being perhaps India’s most unglamorous writer, the writer in rubber chappals who makes his home in Raipur where a flock of ducks looks like a duck, Vinod Kumar Shukla is glamorous in a different way, they say.

He turns the world’s attention away from himself to his writing, which is as down to earth as it is magical and which has now, with the Mathrubhumi Book of the Year Award, been given national recognition, they add.

Speaking on the success of the book, Udayan Mitra, Publisher (Literary) at HarperCollins India, said, ‘Vinod Kumar Shukla is one of the great writers of our time and I hope that this award will encourage many new readers to pick up a copy of ‘Blue Is Like Blue’, and discover the author’s unique world, and his inimitable way with words.

Shukla’s first collection of poems, the 20-page “Lagbhag Jai Hind”, was published in 1971, followed by “Vah Aadmi Chala Gaya Naya Garam Coat Pehankar Vichar Ki Tarah” in 1981.

His first novel, “Naukar Ki Kameez”, was published in 1979 and made into a film by Mani Kaul.

130,2020/02/02,"A palimpsest of pasts: ‘The Chronicle’ by Intizar Husain, trs Matt Reeck, reviewed by Harish Trivedi","Intizar Husain (1925-2016) has slowly and steadily emerged as probably the best fiction writer of Pakistan, a tortoise who has inched ahead of the hares named Manto and Qurratulain Hyder. His grand theme is the idea and formation of Pakistan, the Partition through which the new country was born, and the predicament of the many Muslims who migrated hopefully to the promised land. These muhajirs, of whom he himself was one, form the staple of his fiction. They went across often empty-handed but with a whole load of cultural and historical baggage, which the new nation struggled to make its terms with.

Through indirection

Husain thus narrates the nation, except that he flows over and narrates more than one nation. When does the history of Pakistan begin — in 1947, in 1857, in 1192 when the first Muslim dynasty in India was established, or in the hoary Hindu-Buddhist past when the history of undivided Indian began? The Muslim conquerors found here a country with a long history and rich culture, which some of the more enlightened of them attempted to grasp through translations they commissioned of the Ramayana, the Mahabharata and the Upanishads. It is these multiple pre-Muslim pasts that Husain seeks to endow the new nation of Pakistan with, for without them it would not begin to make sense.

This novel, The Chronicle, published in Urdu in 1987 as Tazkirah, that is, a biographical memoir, is the middle novel in a

loose-limbed trilogy. The first of these, Basti (1979), meaning a settlement or township, was translated into English under the same title by Frances Pritchett in 1995; it begins with peacocks calling as if from Brindaban, home of the peacock-feather-wearing Krishna, and proceeds to encompass the Partition of 1947 as well as the war of 1971 when Pakistan imploded into two disparate Islamic nations, thus giving the lie to the very rationale of the creation of Pakistan.

The third novel, Aagey Samundar Hai (1995), was translated by Rakhshanda Jalil as The Sea Lies Ahead (2015), the title being a reference to President Ayub Khan’s veiled threat to the turbulent muhajirs to quieten down or else be driven into the deep blue sea.

The blurb of The Chronicle says that it is “set in the terrifying times of Zia-ul Haq’s rule”. But this is to do violence to Husain’s subtle art, for Zia is mentioned not even once in the novel. We gather indirectly some way into the novel that Islamic fundamentalism now holds sway over the country. When the hero Ikhlaq goes looking to earn some extra money to repay the loan on the house he has built, an editor asks him to write a book on Islamic banking, for “economists don’t know anything about Islam.”

Dread and censorship

When he says he doesn’t either, the editor next suggests a book on the “Islamic revolution” stretching from Iran to Pakistan; “it would be of service to Urdu and to Islam.” But these are cynical business propositions in the comic vein, for the editor himself believes that the Islamic revolutionaries have “ruined our country. They’ve made the entire younger generation irreligious.”

Husain’s finest stroke of artistic representation comes when one morning Ikhlaq’s wife goes to the gate to buy from a screaming newspaper vendor a special edition and says, “Look at this. Can it be true?” In Ikhlaq’s office, someone from another desk says, “Good riddance!” and invites angry glances. A peon says, “Sir, it’s very bad what has happened.” It is through such subdued whispers in an atmosphere of silent terror that we are left to infer that — the still unnamed — Zia has suddenly died in a plane crash. The dictator is gone but the dread and censorship linger.

What the novel eloquently recounts in several deftly intercalated episodes are half-nostalgic, half-fantastic accounts of the grand past of Ikhlaq’s ancestors who lived in a succession of palaces and havelis, all now deserted and left behind in India. Going even further back are passages of mythology as narrated in a parallel journal by Pandit Ganga Dutt, a Hindu neighbour and “a spiritual brother” of Ikhlaq’s grandfather. These are stories of the righteous Yudhishthir, and of “Hazrat Markandey rishi”, and a just and generous king named Indradyumna, whom even well-read Hindu readers of the novel may have difficulty recalling. Incidentally, the translator Matt Reeck provides no glossary, no introduction, calls balushahi ‘donuts,’ chickpeas ‘garbanzos’, and reduces martial law to ‘marshal law’.

What helps Husain weave all these different strands together is his light poetic touch and his compulsive qissa-go style of seemingly provisional artless narration. His is not magic realism but deeply embedded mythic realism, which floats a foot or two above the ground and transcends mere facts. He once told interviewer Alok Bhalla: “I am a Muslim, but always feel that there is a Hindu sitting inside me.” Similarly, we can sense a Puranasitting inside this novel.

131,2020/02/02,"New dividend distribution tax framework would encourage investments, debt MFs: CBDT","A day after the Union Budget proposed removal of the dividend distribution tax (DDT) levied on companies, the government has said the new regime is expected to encourage more people, especially in the low tax bracket, to invest in the capital market.

The government has further said with dividend now being proposed to be taxed in the hands of the investors at the applicable slab rate, non-residents will get some relief even as it addresses the “issue of inequity in dividend taxation”.

“Single rate of taxation is always iniquitous as it favours taxpayers who are in higher tax brackets and works against those who are in lower tax brackets,” says a statement from the Central Board of Direct Taxes.

“Thus, it was a case of reverse subsidy from the poor to rich taxpayers. Further, non-residents were taxed at a higher rate than the treaty rate with the possibility of no tax credit in the home country,” it said.

According to the government department, while the DDT was pegged at 15%, the effective rate touched 20.56% due to surcharge and cess. Additionally, individuals were required to pay another 10% plus surcharge if the dividend income exceeded ₹10 lakh in a fiscal.

The government believes that the new regime, however, would encourage individuals in low income bracket to invest in the capital market as the tax incidence would drop significantly.

“...person with an income up to ₹5 lakh will not have to pay tax on dividend income as against 20.56% paid by them indirectly. Similarly, under the new tax regime, persons with an income from ₹5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh would pay tax at 10% and persons with ₹7.5 lakh to ₹10 lakh would pay tax at 15%,” it explained.

All these taxpayers would benefit from the abolition of the DDT as the tax to be paid by them on their dividend income would be less than what they were earlier paying indirectly through it, it added.

Interestingly, the government further believes that the proposal would make more investors look at debt mutual fund products as well since under the prevailing framework, the effective DDT on such products was between 38% and 50%.

“The rate similar to DDT for distribution of income by debt fund was 25% for individual and HUF and 30% for others. After grossing up and including surcharge/cess this comes to 38.33% and 49.92% respectively. Thus, the new system would encourage debt mutual fund market in India as most of individuals would pay tax at lower rate on income received from debt fund in comparison to what they were paying under the old regime.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/18n4q4/article30720969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03Taxes-logo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-ddt-framework-would-encourage-investments-debt-mfs-cbdt/article30720970.ece
132,2020/02/02,"Budget 2020 | Every single number is a lie, says Jayati Ghosh","“Every single number in the Budget is a lie,” Jayati Ghosh, Professor of Economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said in Mumbai on Sunday of the Union Budget.

India’s current slowdown is worse than that of 1991 and 2008, and the Budget has cut allocations to all employment-intensive sectors, further adding to the mess, said Ms. Ghosh, one of the world’s leading development economists. “All the most employment-intensive sectors like agriculture, employment guarantee, food, health, education, there are cuts.”

Speaking at a session at Mumbai Collective, titled “Flat tyre or engine failure? The Indian economy”, she said all the numbers in the Budget were false. “Every single number in the Budget is a lie. Every single item of receipts, the revised estimates for what they are spending this year and all what they have received this year is a lie. They have presented the Budget one month early. The year ends at the end of March, we have data only till the end of December, so they have to estimate what’s going to happen in the next three months and that’s where they lie,” she said.

According to Ms. Ghosh, the economic mess started in the mid-2000, celebrated as a period of economic boom. “That is the period when a lot of these problems started. That was the growth based on inequality, and it delivered even more inequality. It was based on the segmented labour market, on the ability of employers to rely on the existing social discriminations by gender, segmented by caste, ethnic categories and locations. It allowed employers to exploit all these social differences to extract labour at the cheapest rates. And that has been a feature of the growth process.”

The session was chaired by Ritu Dewan, former Director of the Department of Economics, University of Mumbai, and the first woman to hold that post. Ms. Dewan said the Budget had scrapped all fellowships for the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe students. “This really means the Budget was based on a caste perspective,” she said. It would be difficult for economists to function as there was lack of data. “Data is the new urban naxal, it is the new anti-national, it is to be jailed, not to be released in spite of pleading. And, therefore, you have this Economic Survey which has used data from Wikipedia,” she said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gijvwn/article30720951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03JAYATIGHOSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/every-single-number-is-a-lie-jayati-ghosh/article30720952.ece
133,2020/02/02,Farmers’ collective to hold protest on Feb. 13,"The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee called the Union Budget anti-farmer and pro-corporate. It would stage a nationwide protest on February 13 against the pro-corporate proposals in the Budget and the government’s failure to address the debts among farmers and the rising input cost and ensure profitable sale of crops.

In a statement, it said: “This is a Budget that has no space for farmers. The Narendra Modi government is yet again sending a message to farmers that it is the companies, and not the farmers, that matter to it.”

The All India Kisan Sabha has also decided to join the protest. Its president Ashok Dhawale said the Union Finance Minister had said the government was committed to doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022, but the Budget she presented was one of the most anti-farmer Budgets in the recent years. “A look at the Finance Bill reveals agriculture and allied sectors have seen massive cuts in allocations,” he said in a statement.

The Tobacco Institute of India said the increase in the national calamity contingent duty (NCCD) and the resulting rise in cigarette taxation, leading to higher tax arbitrage, would embolden illegal cigarette trade operators, who target India.

The Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA) said the increase in the NCCD would further drive up the trade in smuggled cigarettes, affecting the livelihood of Indian Flue Cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco farmers.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/farmers-collective-to-hold-protest-on-feb-13/article30720930.ece
134,2020/02/02,Congress to oppose LIC stake sale,"A day after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced plans to divest a portion of the government’s holding in the Life Insurance Company (LIC), senior Congress leader Manish Tewari on Sunday said the party would oppose the move.

Mr. Tewari, a member of the Congress strategy group for Parliament, also asked the government to spell out its policy towards public sector undertakings (PSUs).

“The Congress would strongly oppose the disinvestment plan through the Initial Public Offer (IPO) route. It is tantamount to selling family jewels in order to fund the budget deficit,” Mr. Tewari told The Hindu.

The Congress leader said the move also raises ‘legitimate suspicion’ about the financial health of the public sector insurance giant as the cash rich LIC has been used to ‘finance’ bail out packages of ailing companies and pick up stakes in loss-making undertakings.

Spell out policy

“The Congress would want the government to spell out its public sector policy before it decides to hand over Air India to a favoured oligarch or demolish the likes of Coal India and LIC. We want to know what is their policy towards public sector,” he asked.

When it was pointed out that the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) had also unsuccessfully put the national airline on the block through the strategic partner sale route, Mr. Tewari responded that the incumbent government has not even put a value to the airline.

“If you read the expression of interest (EOI) document of Air India, it doesn't even have a valuation figure while Air India, with all its assets, is a ₹5 lakh crore company,” he said.

While the Congress’s position on Air India's disinvestment seems to be divided, with a section of leaders including former Finance Minister P. Chidamabaram favouring a sell-off than burdening the tax payers with regular bail-out packages, there is convergence with regard to LIC that could see the government off loading 10% of its stake in the public sector insurance giant.

‘Not necessary’

“As far as LIC is concerned, it is highly debatable. To assume that every public sector must go through a process of disinvestment, partial or whole, is wrong....It has gained in competition with very strong private sector players,” Mr. Chidamabaram had said at the press conference on Saturday.

“We will internally debate it within the party and we will give our view on the floor of the Parliament, but, I think, it is highly debatable proposition,” he added.

The Congress and its ally, the DMK, are also opposing the disinvestment of PSU oil company, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Container Corporation of India, with former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi attending a protest of BPCL employees at the Kochi refinery last December.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gc1vif/article30720909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03LICPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-to-oppose-lic-stake-sale/article30720910.ece
135,2020/02/02,Kerala objects to Budget proposal on period of stay for NRI status,"The Kerala government said on Sunday that it strongly disagreed with the Centre’s move to reduce the minimum period that an Indian citizen employed or living abroad should stay in the country to claim residential status for taxation purposes.

In an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the move to reduce the number of days of compulsory stay from 182 to 120 would hurt lakhs of Indians who had left their homes for foreign shores to fend for their families.

Section 6 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, lays down the conditions for claiming residential status on taxation. As per the provision, the global income of a resident Indian is taxable, whereas, in the case of a Non Resident Indian (NRI), only the person’s revenue earned India falls within the tax net.

Currently, Indian citizens or persons of Indian origin are treated as residents only if they stay in India for at least 182 days.

‘Tax abuse’

The Finance Bill tabled by the Central Government in the Parliament has proposed to reduce the compulsory period of domicile in India to 120 days, ostensibly to net tax dodgers who flit between countries to hide their actual finances from regulators.

Mr. Vijayan said the move to purportedly “check tax abuse” would hit toiling NRIs from Kerala hardest. They formed the bulk of the workforce in the Gulf.

Keralites did not even remotely fall under the category of willful tax evaders, the Chief Minister said. They did not hail from the “economic upper crust” who sought to hide their wealth in tax havens. In contrast, Keralites have poured foreign exchange into the country’s coffers through sheer hard work, Mr. Vijayan said.

If enacted, the law would compel NRIs to compulsorily remain away from home for 240 days to retain their NRI status.

‘Visiting home’

Mr. Vijayan said the majority of non-resident Keralites visited their home State to attend to their domestic affairs and not to escape tax by shifting their base periodically.

A bulk of them, like oil rig workers, toiled for months and years at a stretch in harsh environments, with reduced scope for leave or holiday. The proposed law was a cruel blow to them, he said.

Approximately 15% of Kerala’s Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) hinged on remittances from the Gulf. The amendment would drastically diminish the flow of remittance and worsen the national economic slowdown, the CM said.

The proposed amendment would affect all persons working in countries of the Gulf region that levy no personal income tax, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3e0urf/article25871618.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-PINARAYI-VIJAYAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala-objects-to-budget-proposal-on-period-of-stay-for-nri-status/article30720831.ece
136,2020/02/02,Ire over Shaheen Bagh barricades,"A group of people staged a demonstration near the protest site at Shaheen Bagh here on Sunday, demanding removal of barricades erected on the road connecting Noida to Kalindi Kunj.

They demanded that those sitting on a dharna there for over a month in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act should clear the stretch as commuters are facing difficulties, the police said.

Senior officers, including Joint Commissioner of Police (Southern Range) Devesh Srivastava and Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-East) Chinmoy Biswal, rushed to the spot to bring the situation under control and prevent any untoward incident. The officers are trying to negotiate with the protesters and asking them to maintain peace. At least 52 people were detained and released after a few hours, the police said.

The protesters, including women, raised slogans like “Jai Shree Ram”, “Vande Mataram” and “Khaali Karao Shaheen Bagh wallo ko”.

“We want the roads to be cleared. They [anti-CAA protesters] have been sitting here protesting for 50 days now. It has been causing inconvenience to us. Our children have not been able to go to school because the roads are blocked,” said Rekha Devi of Jasola.

Identity cards

“With heavy barricading, the police have not been allowing us to enter the protest site where women have been sitting for over a month now. I somehow managed to go to work crossing the area. But since yesterday, there has been strict checking and we were not allowed to pass through the stretch without showing our identity cards,” Deepak Patel, a resident of Jasola said.

On Saturday, a 25-year-old man fired two rounds in the air at Shaheen Bagh and was later taken into custody. However, no one was injured in the incident.

According to Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Amlan Nayak, around 40 personnel and an excavator was used for the rescue operation. The rescued pachyderm was a semi-adult female who had strayed away from a 14-member wild elephant herd that had been travelling through the elephant corridor near the spot of the incident.

The ditch was located in an orchard at the foothills of Landasikha near Alarigarh in the Digaphandi forest range. The stranded elephant had fallen into the ditch during the wee hours of Sunday. Locals found the stranded animal and informed the Forest officials, who rushed to the spot. Later, the Forest officials called for the Fire Brigade to assist with the rescue operation.

One side of the ditch was dug up and flattened into a slope by the excavator, to enable the stranded animal to come out.

After it was rescued from the ditch, the elephant was let out into a nearby jungle.

On Thursday former Union minister and Congress leader Manish Tewari had told reporters at a press conference that India now ranks high on the GMI as it scores poorly on the key economic parameters like unemployment rate, inflation rate, lending rate and the annualised growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP).

“@ManishTewari gets it. I rank India a measly 44 out of 95 countries on my #MiseryIndex.

140,2020/02/02,Govt. alert for coronavirus spread from Nepal,"Indian students from Wuhan, who had been evacuated over the weekend by two special Air India flights following the coronavirus outbreak, are being screened in the quarantine facility in Manesar to ensure they have not been infected by the virus, an official said on Saturday.

Another official said the Air India flight that left for Wuhan on Saturday carried ‘ancillary’ medical equipment to be handed over to the Chinese authorities but it did not include face masks. “Unlike the Japanese and some other governments which sent face masks, we could not do so as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the disease in India,” the official said.

The Indian health authorities are especially concerned about the possible spread of the respiratory disease from Nepal, where an outbreak has been reported. “The anxiety is that if the virus spreads to neighbouring Uttar Pradesh and Bihar from Nepal, it would be hard to contain because of the high population density there,” the official said.

Massive numbers

Planning for various contingencies, the Indian authorities are also considering alternatives to air evacuation, should a need arise for a mass exit from China. “There are limits to air evacuation, especially as this can be done only by experienced pilots. Besides, the turnaround time for aircraft coming from a highly infected area is long because planes have to be sanitised and monitoring the crew’s health will be of top priority,” officials said.

Evacuation by ship remains a possible option in view of the size of the population residing in China. “Roughly there are around 40,000 Indians in mainland China, half of whom are students. Besides there are around 20,000 Indian passport holders and people of Indian origin in Hong Kong, many of whom may need to leave,” the source said.

Within China, the National Health Commission on Saturday confirmed 14,380 cases of the virus. So far 304 people had died but 328 patients have recovered. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is sending 1,400 medical workers to the newly built Huoshenshan hospital — a 1,000-bed facility in Wuhan built in a record eight days. Another hospital in the area which can accommodate another 1,600 patients is expected to be operational on February 6.

142,2020/02/02,Schengen visa application fee hiked to €80,"A trip to much of Europe has gone costlier from Sunday with an increase in Schengen visa fees to €80 from the current €60, officials said.

A Schengen visa is needed to visit 26 European countries, including Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Switzerland and Spain.

“The visa fee increases from Euro 60 to Euro 80. This increase is the first one since 2006,” an European Union (EU) official told PTI.

The increase in the visa fee comes as an updated Schengen Visa Code takes effect from February 2 this year.

It brings the fee in line with the level where it would be today if it had been aligned to the general EU-wide inflation rate since 2006, they said.

“The increased visa fee will provide member states with additional financial resources to process visa applications quickly and more efficiently. By international standards, the visa fee remains low,” the official said.

For regular travellers, the fee increase is offset by the new rules on long-validity visas.

These travellers may actually save money under the new provisions, since they have to apply for visas less often, they said.

Minors

Visa fee is still waived for children below six-years-old (as it was the case in the previous rules).

“The visa fee for minors between the age group of 6 and 12 years remains half of the general fee, and thus increases by Euro 5 (to Euro 40),” the official said.

In addition, it is now possible for member States to waive the visa fee for minors between the age group of 6 and 18 years under the new visa regime.

According to the latest exchange rates, a Euro is equivalent to ₹79.37.

People can now apply for the Schengen visa six months before the intended date of travel to Europe instead of three months timeline.

The minimum time period will now be nine months for seafarers, they said.

Multiple-entry visas

In addition to this, frequent travellers with a positive visa history are to be granted multiple-entry visa with a gradually increasing validity period from one year to a maximum of five years, which will save applicants time and money, the official said.

For instance, an applicant who has obtained and used correctly three visas within two years would be granted during this period a multiple-entry visa valid for one year.

An applicant who has obtained and used a multiple-entry visa of one year would be granted (if applied within two years) a multiple-entry visa valid for two years, they explained.

An applicant who has obtained and used a multiple-entry visa of two years would be granted (if applied within three years) a multiple-entry visa valid for five years, the official added.

The visa code also provides for the possibility to adapt the rules for individual countries according to assessment of local circumstances and migratory and security risk, by the local Schengen cooperation, they said.

Such adaptation would be adopted by the European Commission.

The new rules also foresee the possibility to submit an electronically-filled application form, which can also be signed electronically if recognised by the member state competent for examining and deciding on the application, the official said.

Each Schengen member state sets its rules regarding recipient of submissions either directly at an embassy/consulate/mission, or through an external service provider.

More than 16 million Schengen visa applications have been filed at the embassies, consulates and visa centres of the 26 Schengen member countries across the globe in 2018, according to SchengenVisaInfo.com.

In 2018, India was listed as the third largest source for Schengen visa applications with 10,81,359 such requests made from the country, it said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5z64nc/article30458716.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIANPASSPORT1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/schengen-visa-application-fee-hiked-to-80/article30719308.ece
143,2020/02/02,CAA votaries want divisions: Kerala CM,"The movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is also against those who stood with colonisers in the freedom movement when the people’s unity was divided on communal lines, said Kearala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He said the movement has rekindled the spirit of our nationalist movement.

“In the past, our movement was against the colonisers. In the present our struggle against communalism is a movement against those who stood with the colonisers. Back then the colonisers tried to disrupt the people’s unity by dividing us on communal lines. Today, the communal elements are using the same strategy experimented by their previous masters,” he said.

He was speaking at the fourth edition of the Mumbai Collective on the topic of “The National Struggle against communalism”. The session was chaired by N. Ram, Chairman, The Hindu Group Publishing Private Limited.

“In the face of untold economic miseries and emerging people’s resistances, they seek to break the unity of workers, farmers, students, Dalits and adivasis, in the name of religion. We should be able to see through these sinister designs and defeat them.”

Clarifying that the actions of the Kerala government of passing the resolution against the CAA and approaching the Supreme Court against it are constitutionally valid, Mr. Vijayan said the State Ministers take oath and have a duty to stand by the Constitution. “The only provision in the Constitution that limits discussion in legislature is the Article 211 which curtails discussions on the conduct of judges in the Supreme and the High Courts.

144,2020/02/02,J&K administration releases four politicians from preventive detention: officials,"The J&K administration released four more political leaders from a sub-jail in Srinagar on Sunday but is dragging its feet on the release of top mainstream leaders including Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah of the National Conference (NC) and Mehbooba Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), who will complete six months in jail on February 5.

An official identified the four leaders, under detention since the Centre’s August 5 move to revoke J&K special status, as Mohammad Yousuf Bhat of the PDP and Abdul Majid Larmi, Mohammad Shafi and Ghulam Nabi Bhat of the NC.

They were released from the MLA Hostel in Srinagar, a facility for legislators that was converted into a sub-jail in November to accommodate over 40 mainstream leaders.

Earlier on January 16, five leaders were released. An official said just 16 leaders remain inside the MLA Hostel now.

Senior leaders still inside the MLA Hostel include NC’s Ali Muhammad Sagar, who has significant hold in parts of the old city; PDP’s Naeem Akhar, considered a political guru of former Chief Minister and PDP president Ms. Mufti; Sajad Lone, whose Peoples Conference holds sway in parts of Handwara and Kupwara in north Kashmir; and Sahah Faesal, chief of the J&K Peoples Movement, a party that attracted youth immediately after it was launched in Srinagar in 2019.

145,2020/02/02,Nirbhaya case: Delhi HC reserves judgement on Centre’s plea against stay of execution,"The Centre on Sunday sought to remove the stay on the execution of the four convicts in the December 16, 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case, asserting that the credibility of the judiciary and its ability to execute death sentences were at stake.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Home Ministry, argued that the convicts were moving the court one after another with one of them, Pawan Kumar Gupta, yet to file his curative petition.

Mr. Mehta argued there was “a deliberate, calculated, well-thought-out design to frustrate the mandate of the law”.

Senior advocate Rebecca John, appearing for convict Mukesh Kumar Singh, however, objected to the Centre’s plea. “As of today, there is no definitive law which permits what the Centre is seeking ... singling out execution,” she said.

Ms. John questioned why the Centre has woken up just yesterday to execute the death warrant when they were never a party in the proceedings before the trial court. “Union of India has superimposed themselves in this proceeding for the first time. Why have they done so, the court needs to examine,” she argued.

She pointed out that the Centre has already approached the Supreme Court for a clarification on the law which dealt with executing co-convicts separately.

Justice Suresh Kait reserved the order on the plea by the Centre and Delhi government.

In its plea, the government has argued that, “The acts of the four convicts clearly shows their intention to delay the process of execution of death sentences, which is not only an abuse of process of law but also mockery of the courts and judicial process.”

It also termed as erroneous, the decision of the Delhi Court staying the execution of the convicts until further orders.

However, Ms John argued that “the execution cannot be bifurcated the way the government wants the court to do”. She also urged the court to be cautions and not hasten on a punishment which is “irreversible”.

“What is the hurry, if you wait another one month. What is going to happen...My remedies could still be linked to the outcome of the co-convicts...All I am asking for is ‘common sentence, common execution’,” she argued.

On December 16, 2012, a paramedical student was gang raped and brutally assaulted by six men in a private bus and thrown out of the moving vehicle along with her male friend. The victims later succumbed to injuries.

All convicts Mukesh Kumar, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Singh – have been sentenced to death. The order has been upheld by the high court and the Supreme Court.

Except Pawan all convicts have exhausted their legal remedy available to file a curative petition before the Supreme Court.

A State-wide hunt was launched for the escaped prisoners on Sunday morning. The Chief Minister also ordered the ADGP Jails to revamp prison security in the wake of the incident, which came to light around 3.20 a.m., after the undertrial prisoners broke their barrack and escaped by scaling the inner and outer walls of the jail, as per the CCTV footage of the prison, said an official statement.

“The prison guards were alerted about the escape by the other inmates, who included the brother of one of the escaped prisoners, according to initial reports. There was no evidence of outside help, according to preliminary investigations, which suggest that the trio, among 61 prisoners in Barrack no. 7, Ahata No. 2, had planned the escape on their own,” said the statement.

Punjab Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta added in the statement that the men apparently made a hole in the wall of their barrack by removing about 10 bricks. They then appeared to have scaled the inner wall (about 16 feet high) by standing one atop the other, while they climbed the outer wall (21 feet approx.) by using a hook made of a steel bar and the cover of a quilt. They finally escaped the jail complex from a point near Tower No. 10, which was not under CCTV cover, he said.

Official sources said three NIA teams with around 20 members from Delhi, investigating the DSP’s links with the Hizbul Mujahideen and its ‘commander’ Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Babu, raided the houses of Babu and his close associate Khursheed Ahmad Sheikh in Shopian.

Babu’s brother, the NIA investigation suggested, booked an air ticket for the DSP in 2018. Around ₹12 lakh was seized from the house of the police officer in a raid earlier.

Sources said Sheikh, whose house was searched for many hours, is believed to be close to policeman-turned-militant Babu and “has helped the Hizb ‘commander’ in stealing four rifles of the J&K police in Budgam in 2017”.

Sources said the NIA had detained and questioned Sheikh’s brother Tariq Sheikh.

Regarding the raid on the house of sarpanch Tariq Mir, associated with the BJP, an official said: “It was a search operation based on a tip-off. Mir was not arrested during the operation.”

The NIA teams also raided the houses of ‘advocate’ Ifran Mir and Hizb militant Rafi Ahmad. Both were arrested along with the DSP and Babu on January 11 on the Srinagar-Jammu highway when the police officer was ferrying them in a private vehicle outside the Valley.

One active Hizb militant’s house was also searched and some documents seized. There were no reports of seizing any weapons during these raids.

Sources said the NIA teams had seized several bank documents, mobile phones and other electronic gadgets.

According to the police record, Wani is a local commander of the JeM and became an active militant in May, 2017.

The arrest was made following the questioning of two locals arrested from the truck in which the three JeM militants were being ferried on Friday.

The Amnesty International has told the U.S. lawmakers that the recently enacted Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) stands in “clear violation” of the Constitution of India and international human rights law and “legitimises discrimination” on the basis of religion.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday said the government was ready to talk to the protesters at Shaheen Bagh to clear their doubts over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), but that the dialogue should be in a “structured form”.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s second Budget speech on February 1 sought to make up in length and breadth for what it couldn’t deliver in the form of an effective stimulus for India’s fast-slowing economy.

Israel's interior ministry said Saturday it was broadening border restrictions to bar entry to anyone who has visited China in the past two weeks. On Thursday the country barred all flights from China over concern about the coronavirus epidemic, amid growing fears of global contagion.

N.

152,2020/02/02,Budget 2020 | Economy not a priority for BJP government: Amarinder,"Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday said the economy was clearly not a priority for the BJP-led Central government, which was too busy pursuing its negative and divisive agenda.

“There was nothing in the Union Budget that could pave the way for economic reforms or raise public consumption that was an imperative for reviving the economy. The Budget was nothing but mere rhetoric,” said the Chief Minister. It had failed to address the problems of any section of the society, be it the farmers, the youth, the industry/business or the middle class and the poor.

‘Non-visionary Budget’

Far from reviving business sentiment, the non-visionary budget, which reflected the Union government’s total apathy to the needs and aspirations of the people, would plunge the economy further to abysmal depths, said Capt. Singh.

Pointing to the Finance Minister’s failure to even mention the economic slowdown of 2019-20, the Chief Minister said this showed that the Centre had no intention of addressing the problems faced by the economy.

While the announcement about selling a part of its holding in LIC was made in the Budget presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier in the day, the Centre has often expressed its preference for opening up some sections of the Indian Railways for private sector investment and privatising Air India.

‘From ICU to ventilator’

West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra said that before the Budget, “economy was in ICU (Intensive Care Unit), and now it is on a ventilator.”

Mr. Mitra, who had previously served as secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), described the Budget as anti-people. There was nothing for the people at bottom of the pyramid.

“Radical reductions have taken place in funds for the schemes for agriculture, health, education, SC-ST, and together they constitute a reduction of 8.9%. This tells that the government has no vision about the social infrastructure.” The Minister said reductions had also been made in MGNREGA and the National Health Mission.

Mr. Mitra said LIC had been struggling with NPAs of over ₹30,000 crore and “now it has been opened to private players to be eaten.” He also described the income tax reduction in the Budget as a “bluff,” giving with one hand and taking more with the other.

He was arrested on October 21 last year from a private hospital in connection with the ₹640-crore scam of 2008.

The case related to the registration of an FIR in the West Agartala Police Station on October 13 last against Choudhury and some top PWD officials.

156,2020/02/02,"Budget 2020 | Rail, flight services to transport farm produce","The Centre has raised the target for agricultural credit by 11% to ₹15 lakh crore in 2020-21 and proposed to begin special rail and flight services to transport farm produce as part of a 16-point action plan for the agriculture sector announced in the Union Budget on Saturday.

However, some farmers’ groups said the Budget’s allocation of ₹1.6 lakh crore for agriculture, irrigation and allied farm activities for 2020-21 was only a nominal increase, and added that there was a large gap between allocation of funds and actual expenditure in the implementation of several schemes.

In her budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that Railways would set up a Kisan Rail programme through public-private partnership to build a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, including milk, meat and fish. Refrigerated coaches would be built in express and freight trains as well, she said.

Refrigerated vans

“We have already designed refrigerated vans and nine such vans are in use. Their capacity is 17 tonnes. We have the concept and the design, and now need to scale up to take it pan-India,” said Railway Board chairman V.K. Yadav.

Ms. Sitharaman added that a Krishi Udaan scheme would be launched by the Civil Aviation Ministry on international and national routes, in a move that would help improve value realisation especially in the northeast and tribal districts. She also proposed to step up viability gap funding to set up warehouses and double the milk processing capacity to 108 million tonnes by 2025. She also proposed to operationalise a scheme to let farmers set up solar power generation capacity on their fallow or barren lands and to sell it to the grid.

Expansion of scheme

On agricultural credit, the Finance Minister said the NABARD refinance scheme would be further expanded and set the year’s farm loan disbursal target at ₹15 lakh crore.

PM-KISAN, the farmers’ income support scheme that was launched just before the Lok Sabha elections received an allocation of ₹75,000 crore, the same amount as allocated for 2019-20, despite the fact that only ₹54,370 crore was actually spent last year.

The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, an umbrella body of more than 200 farmers’ groups, said there was a pattern of large gaps between announcements and actual expenditure in the agriculture space.

“In 2018-19, it was promised that 22,000 rural haats will be upgraded to Grameen Agriculture Markets (GrAM), but after two years, the implementation has not begun and only 0.5% funds have been spent. In 2018-19, Finance Minister promised that MSP will reach every single farmer and PM-AASHA scheme was instituted. In 2019-20, only ₹1500 crore was allocated and only ₹321 crore was spent. The allocation has now been slashed to ₹500 crore,” said an AIKSCC statement.

157,2020/02/02,BJP-Jana Sena team visits capital villages,"A delegation of the BJP and Jana Sena Party (JSP) visited Mandadam and some other villages in the Amaravati Capital region and expressed solidarity with the farmers whose agitation against the proposed splitting of the capital into three parts, entered the 47th day on Sunday.

BJP leader and former Minister Ravela Kishore Babu said Amaravati was conceived as the permanent capital city of A.P. by the TDP government, but Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy came up with the idea of three capitals as part of his divisive agenda.

‘Not a local issue’

JSP leader B. Srinivasa Yadav said his party president Pawan Kalyan had supported the protests against the decentralisation of administration and pointed out that it was not a problem limited to the farmers in Amaravati but of the people of the entire State and the future generations.

The BJP was represented by Pathuri Nagabhushanam, V. Jayaprakash Narayana, T. Venkatesh Yadav, Patibandla Ramakrishna, Kilaru Dileep and Vangaveeti Narendra and JSP by Chillapalli Srinivas, Pothina Mahesh, Kamatham Sambasiva Rao and R. Sowjanya.

BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana said the Central government has given several projects to Andhra Pradesh, though they were not mentioned in the A.P. Reorganisation Act but the regional parties were accusing the Centre of deceiving the State to show the BJP in poor light.

Addressing media persons in Guntur, Mr. Lakshminarayana said the Union Budget was for the entire country and to say that it belied the expectations of a particular State was unfair.

He said it had become a habit to point fingers at the Central government which has its limitations.

The YSR Congress Party government was blaming the Centre for its failures and instead of utilising the decisive mandate given to it by the electorate. The Chief Minister was misusing it for political gain, he added.

The A.P. BJP chief alleged that the intention behind shifting the Secretariat to Visakhapatnam was to help those who were close to the government in doing real estate business in the port city.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/138qve/article30724009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03ONGOLE3RAVELLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bjp-jana-sena-team-visits-capital-villages/article30721212.ece

Addressing the cadre at the district party office here on Sunday, Mr. Sailajanath accused the BJP of dividing the people in the name of religion and the YSRCP of unleashing terror using its cadre, officials, and police personnel.

“Hatred against minorities, Muslims in particular, is spreading fast like virus under the BJP rule. The plight of women cannot be described as they do not have any safety in the country,” Mr. Sailajanath alleged.

“There is no administration in the State. The Congress will stand by the disadvantaged classes in the villages,” he said.

“In my own constituency, Singanamala, people fear asking for irrigation and drinking water as they cannot speak without the permission of the MLA,” he alleged.

Three capitals opposed

Post bifurcation, both the State and Union governments made no effort to develop Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Sailajanath alleged.

He said that the Congress was opposed to the setting up of three capitals in the State, and promised to stand by those opposing it.

DCC president Kota Satyam and city Congress president Dada Gandhi and secretary Golla Nagaraju, and INTUC leader Ramana were present.

Earlier, a motorcycle rally was taken out from ISKON temple on the city outskirts to the DCC office at Saptagiri Circle when Mr. Sailajanath arrived from Kurnool.

159,2020/02/02,State looks to AFD support for generating low-cost power,"The Energy Department has sought financial and technological support from the French government agency, Agence Française de Développement (AFD), for reducing the cost of power generation and ensuring quality supply.

A high-level delegation, led by AFD country director Bruno Bosle, met Energy Secretary N. Srikant recently and held discussions on the scope for investing in the power sector, an official release here said.

Tapping solar power

Mr. Srikant said the government was contemplating establishing a 10,000 MW solar power project for supplying power to the agriculture sector, for which 50,000 acres had been identified in Kadapa, Kurnool, Anantapur and Prakasam districts.

This would earn the distinction for A.P. as the first State to undertake such a project exclusively for the farm sector.

Besides, the State government intended to introduce cutting-edge technologies across power generation, transmission and distribution chain, and sought the cooperation of AFD in providing technical assistance for scaling the operations.

Mr. Srikant further said that high electricity costs and interruptions in power supply were acting as a disincentive to investment and hampering competitiveness. Keeping that in view, the government preferred low-cost power.

Officials of the Energy Department told the visiting dignitaries that the purchase of renewable power at high prices imposed a huge financial burden on the Discoms, which incurred a loss of ₹29,000 crore by the end of 2019.

The Discoms are taking loans from financial institutions such as IREDA and A.P. Power Finance Corporation for paying their dues to the renewable energy generators. The government has, therefore, resolved to bring down the costs.

The AFD team said it was keen on supporting the projects that help in mitigating the impact of climate change and have the potential to generate long-term positive impact on the quality of life.

160,2020/02/02,YSRCP seeks to upstage Naidu on his home turf,"Naravaripalle village in the Chandragiri constituency, the native place of former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu, witnessed palpable tension with the ruling YSR Congress Party deciding to hold a public meeting on the importance of having three capitals.

Local MLA and Government Whip Chevireddy Bhaskar Reddy chose this place apparently to send the message across to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) that the government would not be cowed down by a spate of demonstrations against the decentralisation move. The government, however, drew flak for mobilising resources at its disposal for holding a huge meeting.

Government Advisor Ajeya Kallam, who listed the events that made the government think of decentralisation, accused the previous regime of resorting to economic indiscipline and impropriety in land allocation, thus landing the State in mess. He wondered why the agitating farmers were worried only about land value and not remunerative price. He charged Mr. Naidu with claiming credit for the development of Hi-Tec City in Hyderabad, though it was conceived by his predecessors.

“We have already seen the ill-effects of concentrating all facilities in the same region and hence the decision,” he said. Citing the Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu examples, he brushed aside at one go both arguments — central location of Amaravati and vulnerability of coastal Vizag to natural disasters such as cyclones and floods.

Agriculture Minister Kurasala Kannababu said the government would not go back on its decision on three capitals, though it might get delayed due to procedural hassles.

Advisor Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy flayed Mr. Naidu for keeping his people in the dark. In sharp contrast, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, strove for the uplift of the downtrodden.

‘No political agenda’

Tirupati MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy said Rayalaseema got its recognition only after YSR became Chief Minister. Mr. Naidu had neglected the region though he hailed from it, he added.

Clarifying that his meeting was not politically motivated, Mr. Bhaskar Reddy said he only intended to reach out to every corner of his constituency.

161,2020/02/02,Jagan responsible for poor allocations to State: Yanamala,"Former Finance Minister and TDP polit bureau member Yanamala Ramakrishnudu held Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy responsible for the steep fall in the budgetary allocations and releases from the Central government to the State.

In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said that the Chief Minister had remained silent on the Union Budget though Andhra Pradesh has got a raw deal. It appeared as though Mr. Jagan had mortgaged the State’s interests to come out clean from the cases he was facing. He failed miserably in apprising the Central government and the 15th Finance Commission on the State’s finances and losses suffered by the State at the time of bifurcation. Instead of winning favour, the Chief Minister had invited the wrath of the Centre by scrapping the Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). The end result was poor allocations to the State in the Union Budget, the TDP leader said.

Mr. Jagan used to make tall claims that he would get the Special Category Status to (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh if the YSR Congress Party got 22 MP seats. Leave alone getting the SCS, Andhra Pradesh has suffered a loss of ₹1,521 crore due to the failure of the Chief Minister as the State’s share has come down by 0.2% in fund devolution by the 15th Finance Commission. There was a reduction in the Central pool and share in the schemes, and zero fund allocation to the Polavaram project, Mr. Yanamala said.

The Chief Minister himself had told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the State did not require funds for Amaravati Capital, he pointed out.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fh5m72/article30724000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJPG4-YANAMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-responsible-for-poor-allocations-to-state-yanamala/article30720552.ece
162,2020/02/02,Gas leaks as pipeline develops crack,"Tension prevailed at Uppudi village in Katrenikona mandal of East Godavari district on Sunday following a leak from a gas pipeline maintained by the PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited, a private agency.

The pipeline developed a crack and gas leaked from it making sound which created panic in the village. When The Hindu tried to contact the PFH officials, they were not available for any comment.

According to sources, the gas pipeline connected to Katrenikona well passed through a few villages, including Uppudi, and it got damaged on Sunday.

“As the gas that leaked from the pipeline is inflammable, officials stopped power supply to the nearby villages and asked the residents not to light stoves or firewood which may lead to the gas catching fire,” said a villager. Gas leaked from the pipeline had petrol smell and it spread to the nearby hamlets, said a woman, Satyavathi.

On receiving information, fire and rescue personnel and technical team of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Rajamahendravaram, rushed to the spot and extended support to the PFH personnel in plugging the pipeline leakage.

Precautionary measure

“As a precautionary measure, we asked the residents to be cautious and vehicular traffic has been suspended for a while on the main road towards Uppudi to Katrenikona. Some nearby houses were vacated,” said an officer monitoring the operation.

This was the second gas pipeline leak incident reported in the last three days in East Godavari district. A gas pipeline of the ONGC leaked at Antarvedi on January 31.

ONGC officials clarified that the corporation was in no way connected to the incident.

P. Satyanarayana, a local, blamed the PFH and the ONGC managements for frequent gas and oil pipeline leakages in the region. Such incidents were happening due to poor maintenance of the pipelines, he said.

The villagers appealed to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and the officials of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) to inspect the KG basin, monitor the oil and gas exploration operations, check the maintenance of wells and pipelines.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gas-leaks-as-pipeline-develops-crack/article30720547.ece
163,2020/02/02,"JAC takes ‘save Amaravati’ fight to Delhi, meets Kishan Reddy","Even as the protest by Amaravati farmers reached the 47th day on Sunday, a delegation of farmers led by the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi Joint Action Committee (JAC) took the ongoing battle to prevent the proposed shifting of the Executive capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam, to the capital of the nation, New Delhi.

A 16-member delegation comprising nine representatives of the JAC and seven farmers from villages in the Amaravati region, met the Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy in the evening, urging the Centre to intervene and prevail upon the Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh not to shift the capital from Amaravati.

“Mr. Kishan Reddy said that the Centre had not received any official communication from the Jagan government in Andhra Pradesh on the proposed three-capital formula and that the Bharatiya Janata Party would act at the right time,” said JAC member Dr. Nanda Kishore, from Delhi.

He said Mr. Kishan Reddy had reiterated that the BJP had made its stand on the issue clear by stating that it was in favour of Amaravati continuing as the capital of the residual State of Andhra Pradesh.

Narrate woes

Dr. Nanda Kishore said the farmers had explained to the Central Minister that the Jagan Mohan Reddy government was indifferent to their pain and anguish. They had told him that even women and children had for the first time hit the streets as implementation of the government plans would push their future into darkness.

“Realising that our future is at stake, we have come on to the roads pleading with the government to consider the plight of farmers who have given their lands for the future of the State. Contrary to Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy’s claims that the Centre is kept in the loop on his three-capital plan, the Union Minister has clearly denied having received any official communication to this effect,” said Snehalatha Reddy, a native of Peddaparimi village under Thullur panchayat, whose family has given 16 acres of land to the government.

Plan to meet Modi

On Monday, the delegation plans to meet Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, Finance Minister Nirmala Seetharaman and others. “We have also sought the appointment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. We will return to the State only after meeting all the leaders who can make a difference on the capital issues,” said R.V. Swamy, president of the Vijayawada chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India and a JAC member.

Rally

On the home front, meanwhile, leaders of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi have called for a protest rally from BRTS Road at Padavalarevu to Meesala Rajeswara Rao bridge via Madhuranagar junction and Food junction, at 4.30 p.m on Monday.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jac-takes-save-amaravati-fight-to-delhi-meets-kishan-reddy/article30720528.ece

She was stopped by the Chinese authorities from flying out of the country as she was running a temperature on Saturday. Wuhan is the epicentre of the novel coronavirus and the authorities suspected her of carrying the virus.

She has released a video on social media, which has since gone viral. Identified as A. Jyothi, a native of Eerlapaadu of Bandi Atmakur mandal in the district, has gone to Wuhan as part of her job training. She is employed with TCL in Tirupati and is supposed to be getting married on 14 February.

167,2020/02/02,"For mango lovers, it will be a wait longer than usual","The abundant rains last year may have been a blessing to farmers across the district, but they have spelt gloom for the cultivators of mango. The current delay in the flowering of mango trees is being attributed to the prolonged monsoon in the district last year.

Speaking with The Hindu, assistant director of horticulture B. Raghunath Reddy said that there needs to be low moisture content in the soil for the trees to start blooming. “Because rains persisted longer than usual, the moisture content in the soil was high, which delayed the blooming,” he explained.

The Banginapalli (Benishan) mango trees – originating in Kurnool –are shy bearers, as we get to see its flowers only every alternate year. “There are about 4,500 – 5,000 hectares of mango plantations across the district. All of them are experiencing delayed flowering,” Mr. Reddy added.

M. Shiva, a 23-year-old tenant farmer from Orvakal mandal, said that the flowering of the plants has begun just about a month ago, as against the normal time of early December. Mr. Shiva, a tenant farmer for over six years now, added: “This is the first time that flowering has been delayed by this much. Otherwise, by now, the trees should have borne fruits.”

Low yield

With bad weather conditions for the trees to bear flowers and summer looming right around the corner, the farmers of the district are also concerned about yields.

The farmers predict that the yield could be cut down by as much as 50% this upcoming season. “Normally a tree yields about 1,000 mangoes. We are currently expecting them to bear anywhere between 300-500 mangoes,” said a 50-year-old tenant farmer Chinna Pullaiah, from Orvakal mandal, adding that there would be a further drop in the yield if the weather conditions are unfavourable.

Ultimately, it is the customer who would be bearing the brunt of the low yield. The authorities expect that the prices would skyrocket owing to low supply.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fuhf8e/article30728045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPAGEMANGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/for-mango-lovers-it-will-be-a-wait-longer-than-usual/article30720033.ece

170,2020/02/02,"Taking basic precautions is enough, say doctors","The Sri Venkateswara Ramnarain Ruia Government General Hospital (SVRRGGH) has set up an isolation ward for novel coronavirus (nCoV) cases at its Infectious Diseases Building.

Equipped with ventilators, the ward has been readied to treat even critically-ill patients. While no cases have been reported so far, doctors are on alert. Protocols and procedures have been put in place to isolate any suspected cases at the special ward.

""We are fully prepared for any exigency. The necessary equipment is in place. However, awareness is key. We have prepared some material and are displaying posters to create awareness among the public on prevention techniques, as it can help in curbing the spread of the disease,"" hospital superintendent N.V. Ramanaiah told The Hindu.

""It is difficult to identify nCoV as the initial symptoms are generally the same as common cold, cough and fever. However, if left unchecked, it will aggravate quickly and cause kidney failure and subsequently death. As of now, nothing more needs to be done other than wearing protective masks and maintaining personal hygiene,"" Dr. Ramanaiah said.

Nodal officer for the special ward, S. Subba Rao, said it would take at least 8-14 days for the symptoms to appear. It can spread through coughing and sneezing, Dr. Rao added.

Locals are worried about the presence of several Chinese citizens in the industrial clusters of Renigunta and Yerpedu near Tirupati and Sri City, both in Chittoor district. There are five Chinese firms operating in Sri City, while another six are in various stages of construction.

However, officials said that there is no cause for worry, as none of the employees working in the operational units have visited China in the recent past.

""We have sought information from the companies on the list of employees who had visited China and returned after January 15. No such case has been detected, but we have asked for their specific arrival date to be doubly sure,"" said Sri City Public Relations Officer C. Ravindranath. Though Renigunta and Sri City are nearly 80 km apart, media reports confuse one for the other which is causing undue panic, he said.

There are also fears that passengers arriving at the city airport after stopovers at international and domestic destinations might be carriers of nCoV, but officials said these fears are misplaced. ""Tirupati does not have any direct international flights, and all connecting flights arrive here after landing at other major airports in the country - all of which already have mechanisms to screen inbound passengers,"" an airport official said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hj3kcn/article30719612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/221938130col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/taking-basic-precautions-is-enough-say-doctors/article30719613.ece
171,2020/02/02,Is Vizag ready to handle nCoV?,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) in China and its subsequent spread to other countries, including India, has thrown a challenge to the medical fraternity. The strain in this virus is new and mutated and there is no vaccine as of now. The only immediate remedy in sight is isolation and symptomatic treatment.

Cities such as Visakhapatnam are vulnerable as it has an international airport and two major ports, including a private port.

The question is whether the city, and more importantly, its medical fraternity, is prepared to handle an eventual outbreak of the disease.

‘Inadequate arrangements’

Medical practitioners say that immediate arrangements are in place, but they are temporary and inadequate if there is an outbreak.

Fortunately, no cases have been reported so far. Isolation wards have been earmarked with a limited number of beds but what is required is a long-term sustainable plan to handle such eventualities, said Dr. C.V. Rao, former Vice-Chancellor of NTR University of Health Sciences.

""Merely setting up of temporary wards in existing hospitals will not suffice. What is needed is a permanent isolation ward, and preferably a dedicated hospital with trained staff,"" Dr. Rao said.

Doctors opine that such a ward must have exclusive staff who are highly trained to handle such cases. The wards should have all facilities, including ventilators and emergency medicine, and the staff should be trained to handle the patients as well as themselves. Fumigation should be part of the infrastructure and the staff should be given body suits and other safety gear, doctors said.

Andhra Medical College principal Dr. P.V. Sudhakar said that there should be a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place to handle the patient, right from the entry point such as the airport all the way to the ward. ""Along with a battery of medical tests, what is important is to know is the travel history of the suspected patient and his future itinerary,"" Dr. Sudhakar said.

Doctors also feel that the government should set up at least one virology centre in Visakhapatnam on the lines of the one in Pune. The centre can be converted into a research and study centre, said Dr. Sudhakar.

Measures in place

A thermal scanner was installed at the Visakhapatnam International Airport on January 30. A help desk was opened and all international passengers with symptoms of cough, cold, running nose and fever are being screened by doctors.

""We have opened isolation wards at all government teaching hospitals in the State as per the guidelines of the Union Health Ministry. A doctor has been appointed as the nodal officer for nCoV at each of these hospitals to collect data and report to me on a daily basis,"" said Dr. K. Rambabu, Professor of Medicine, Andhra Medical College (AMC), who has been appointed the State Nodal Officer to check the spread of the disease.

""We have all the required basic testing and safety equipment including N95 masks, protective suits, goggles and disposable kits at our disposal. Samples like throat swabs of suspected persons will be sent to the Microbiology Department of AMC/KGH for scientific packing. Couriers have already been identified for quick and safe delivery of the samples,"" Dr. Rambabu explained.

""Though the symptoms of swine flu and nCoV appear similar, there are two basic differences. While a swine flu patient suffers from a blocked nose, difficulty in breathing and gets wet cough early after the onset of the disease, an nCoV patient suffers from a running nose and gets dry cough two to three days after the onset of the disease. An isolation ward will be opened near the port in view of the threat of crewmembers arriving from foreign shores,"" Dr. Rambabu said.

Airport on vigil

172,2020/02/02,Decentralised development will spur growth in Prakasam: Balineni,"The decentralised development model of the YSR Congress Party government in the State will spur growth in Prakasam district, said Energy Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy.

Speaking after paying floral tributes to statesman Tanguturi Prakasam Pantulu during the 51st District Formation Day fete, he said it was unfortunate that the district had not developed to the expected levels in the past.

“Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is very particular in ensuring speedy development of all the regions, including Prakasam,” he said, adding farmers could expect water flowing to their lands from Veligonda Project later this year.

‘A solution to water woes’

Education Minister A. Suresh, a member of the high-power committee on State capital, hailed the distributive capital model as an apt one for balanced regional development. Big ticket projects like sea port at Ramayapatnam and Donakonda Industrial Corridor would see light of the day, he said.

The reservoir at Bollapalli would ensure a permanent solution to the water woes of Prakasam ryots in the areas that fall under Nagarjuna Sagar Right Bank Canal ayacut.

A glimpse into the past

Ongole MP Magunta Srinivasulu Reddy urged the Ministers to ensure inclusion of Prakasam in the list of seven backward districts identified at the time of adoption of the State Reorganisation Act by the Centre. On his part, he promised to strive for getting maximum funds from the Centre for the district.

A friendly cricket tournament was organised among the teams led by the Ministers, District Collector, Superintendent of Police and the mediapersons on the occasion.

A photo exhibition was also organised with some rare pictures dating back to the freedom struggle movement, including the one in which Prakasam Pantulu is bearing his chest during a protest against the visit of Simon Commission to Madras.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wy6ry8/article30719564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJPAGE3BALINENI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/decentralised-development-will-spur-growth-in-prakasam-balineni/article30719565.ece
173,2020/02/02,Virulent strains not new to Seema,"Handling outbreaks of upper and lower respiratory diseases is not new to the Rayalaseema region.

In Anantapur and Kurnool districts, Swine Flu (H1N1) cases were reported in 2010, 2015 and again in 2018, leading to fatalities. There has been a pattern to the outbreaks — it was noticed that there was a gap of three to five years between each outbreak.

Doctors point to climate change as a reason behind the lull between each outbreak. ""The viruses take the help of sudden changes in the weather to turn virulent and attack humans. This cycle repeats itself over a period of two, three or five years with virulent strains emerging out of lakhs of mutations during this period,"" said doctors.

Currently, the Health Department is not only concentrating on novel-Coronavirus (nCoV) of Chinese origin, but also on any new strains that would have mutated locally due to unusual weather conditions within the country and in Andhra Pradesh. Surveillance of people with similar symptoms is being done.

The first suspected case of nCoV came from Visakhapatnam — a person who had an extensive travel history. Thankfully, the person tested negative for nCoV after extensive tests, but will be kept under surveillance for 28 days to fully rule out the possibility of contracting the virus.

Kurnool district witnessed 12 deaths in 2018 due to H1N1, and over 30 persons tested positive for the disease by November 2018. However, some of those cases were contributed by Anantapur district too as the Anantapur Government General Hospital did not have a testing laboratory till December 2018. The Rapid Test Lab was operationalised in January 2019, and a month before that, a Special Isolation Ward was set up on the Anantapur GGH premises on the second floor of the Chest Ward. Kurnool GGH, which had a testing facility, operationalised a Special Ward.

Risk groups on watch

The Health Department is now keeping a close watch on risk groups all over the district, beginning with administering vaccines to nurses/hospital staff, and displaying information about nCoV at all Primary Health Centres. In a couple of days, the IEC method would be used for improving awareness among the general public on the nCoV.

All doctors and nurses have been sensitised about nCoV and information boards would be set up in Telugu at all PHCs and public places, with Anantapur district alone readying about one lakh posters.

Every Friday, 40 to 70 pregnant women come to the PHCs for regular check-ups. Doctors there are taking the opportunity to drive home messages about H1N1 and nCoV as pregnant women form a risk group. Every Wednesday, it is the turn of mothers to read out the contents of the pamphlets to those waiting to get their children immunised. In addition to these, every morning, PHC doctors supervise reading out of preventive measures for H1N1, or sunstroke. Now, it has been made mandatory to make patients read up on nCoV and then initiate discussions with doctors to clarify any doubts.

The addresses and phone numbers of all students/doctors currently living in China have been obtained and they are now being sensitised. Till a suspected case is found, the strategy would be to promote personal hygiene and coughing etiquette to ensure nCoV or H1N1 does not spread, Dr. Anil Kumar said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/virulent-strains-not-new-to-seema/article30719551.ece

A celestial spectacle

The town milled with pilgrim activities with devotees congregating at the North-West corner of the hill temple since Friday night to witness the first rays of Sun fall on the feet of Lord Malayappa mounted on the dazzling Surya Prabha Vahanam.

The scene at the North-West corner of the town was choc-a-bloc with the devotees occupying every inch of available space.

Sheer bliss

Devotees, who till then waited patiently went into raptures as the sunrays touched the feet of the deity atop the vahanam. It was a sight to behold as tens of thousands of devotees offered Harathis standing at their respective places.

Later, the day was marked by the periodical processions of the Lord on Chinna Sesha, Garuda, Hanumantha, Kalpavriksha, Sarva Bhoopala Vahanams and concluded with the grand procession of Chandra Prabha.

Top brass on the field

The authorities had a tough time in ensuring uninterrupted supply of free food packets and water bottles with tens of thousands of devotees remaining glued to their positions around the mada streets. The temporary sheds set up along the mada streets to protect the devotees from the afternoon sun and chill weather during the evening also made them affixed to their seats. Devotees were all praise for the unprecedented arrangements and verbalized their satisfaction when the TTD Executive officer Anilkumar Singhal and Additional EO A.V.

Building a go-kart is considered the first step towards learning car designing and automobile engineering. Nine teams from different colleges showcased their talent in a series of rounds conducted to test technical aspects, endurance, business model and other aspects.

The go-karts, built entirely by the students, buzzed around the track at a speed of 50 kmph, enthralling the audience. The race was also organised by students of the participating colleges. The final round would be conducted on Sunday in the presence of judges, organisers said.

A drone voyage competition was also another prime attraction of the event. Sixteen teams displayed their driving skills and overcoming hurdles along the specified path. Around 35 teams took part in a ‘robot race’. In the Project Expo competition, students of Nehru Memorial College of Puthanampatti in Tamil Nadu displayed their project called ‘Hydraulic Solar Power Storage Technology’.

Projects galore

Students of Karpagam-Nehru Memorial College of Tiruchirapalli explained the benefits of ‘Glass for Visually-Challenged Persons’. KPR Institute of Engineering and Technology-Coimbatore narrated the benefits of their project titled Automated Car Parking Systems. Students of the same college gave a presentation on a concept titled ‘Smart medicine carrier using drones for the benefit of patients in hilly areas’.

177,2020/02/02,Police rescue kidnapped infant within hours,"The Kurnool Police on Saturday rescued an infant who was kidnapped from the Government General Hospital (GGH) here. Police acted swiftly to rescue the baby and reunite her with her parents by noon, within hours of her kidnapping.

Superintendent of Police Fakkerappa Kaginelli said that a woman named P. Mariamma gave birth to a girl nine days ago at the GGH, and was discharged three days after the delivery. Ms. Mariamma visited the hospital on Saturday along with her sister for a tubectomy, with her infant in tow. They reached the hospital by 7 a.m., and were asked to wait till 9.30 a.m. as there were no doctors available.

As they were waiting, a 23-year-old woman identified as Chandra Kalavati struck up a conversation with Ms. Mariamma, and offered to cradle her infant till her check-up was over.

Ms. Mariamma then went inside the doctors’ cabin for a check-up, and was asked to get a few tests done. While giving her blood samples, Ms. Mariamma asked her sister Padmaja to check on her baby, who was with Kalavati. When Ms. Padmaja went to check on the baby, she saw Kalavati walking away with the baby and boarding an auto-rickshaw. Ms. Padmaja then immediately alerted the Three Town Police.

Police formed five search parties and circulated the news on WhatsApp, and launched surprise vehicle checks across the district.

Quick thinking

Meanwhile, Peapully Sub-Inspector Maruthi Shankar saw the WhatsApp alert and identified the alleged kidnapper as she had a case registered against her. He then went directly to her house to see the infant sleeping on Kalavati’s bed.

Mr. Maruthi Shankar then sent a photograph of the infant to the Three Town police officers, who in turn showed it to the parents. The parents confirmed that the child was theirs.

Mr. Kaginelli returned the infant to her parents by Saturday evening. Police took Kalavati into custody and filed a case against her and have launched an investigation.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/police-rescue-kidnapped-infant-within-hours/article30716613.ece
178,2020/02/02,Pension given to elderly persons at doorstep,"Pensioners in the town woke up to a pleasant surprise when village/ward volunteers knocked on their doors on Saturday morning.

The pensioners were given ₹2,250 as monthly pension by the volunteers. Earlier, the pensioners were forced to visit post offices or banks to collect their pensions, but in a first, they received their pension at their doorstep.

In Guntur, 4,170 ward volunteers attached to 207 ward secretariats distributed pensions.

Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy, in a tweet, expressed his joy after pensioners received their money on the first day of the month. “I am happy that instead of the earlier amount of ₹1,000 that pensioners used to get before the elections, a pension amount of ₹2,250 has been given to the elderly on the first day of the month. Our government has also reduced the maximum age limit of pensioners from 65 years to 60 years and we have increased the number of pensioners to 6.11 lakh. We will raise the number of pensioners further,” Mr. Jagan tweeted.

The CM also congratulated the village/ward volunteers who worked tirelessly to achieve the target of pension disbursal.

In Guntur, Collector I. Samuel Ananda Kumar and Municipal Commissioner personally handed over the pensions to beneficiaries at Srinivasa Nagar Colony.

“I am happy that the elderly pensioners are getting their monthly social security pensions on the first day of the month. This practice will be continued every month,” Mr. Samuel said.

Anuradha said that the ward secretariat system would be fully functional and all government benefits would be delivered at the doorstep of beneficiaries.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/p7mtfg/article30716576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02-VJ-GUNTURPENSIONERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pension-given-to-elderly-persons-at-doorstep/article30716577.ece
179,2020/02/02,3 murder case accused arrested in fake certificate racket,"Three accused in the 2015 Peddavaduguru Single Window Office murder case, who were facing non-bailable warrants after coming out on bail, were arrested on Saturday along with two others who were allegedly running a fake certificates manufacturing racket in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh for the past decade.

Superintendent of Police B. Sathya Yesu Babu said here on Saturday that Glenn Bricks, 51, hailing from Guntakal in the district was wanted in several cases in the two States and was allegedly running a fake certificates gang along with his driver, Panchanam Madan, 26.

The three murder accused, Kachagarla Venkatesh Naidu, 50, Gurram Ramesh Naidu, 55, and Gurram Venkata Ramana, 50, reportedly met Glenn Bricks seven months ago and allegedly joined him in his fake certificates racket. Following a complaint, the Pamidi Rural Police arrested these five persons and recovered 699 gm of gold, an SUV, 11 mobile phones, computers, printing machine, 70 fake certificates, fake Identification Cards of police constable, a police name plate, a siren and police lights bar on the vehicle.

180,2020/02/02,"Budget will give a push to IT sector in city, say stakeholders","The IT sector is upbeat over the proposals in the Union Budget-2020, and foresees bright prospects for growth in business process management units in Visakhapatnam.

Stakeholders in the industry lauded the budget proposals and said that these would give a big push to the establishment of data parks by Adani and other firms. Adani Group has proposed to set up multiple data centres at Kapulappada and other areas in the city.

“Connecting more villages through BharatNet by allocation of ₹6,000 crore will boost digital transactions. The government’s thrust on using artificial intelligence, Internet of Things and high-speed bandwidth connecting high-end technology in rural villages and providing incentives to data centres will propel India into the big league,” Rushikonda IT Park Association (RITPA) vice-president Naresh Kumar said.

“Data centres need a huge amount of electricity. Promoting green power companies with lowest tax slab of 15% will boost FDI in this sector, helping build sustainable data centres,” he said.

Promoting new manufacturing companies at one of the lowest tax slabs in the world at 15% and giving high incentives to new electronic manufacturers and phone companies would give a fillip to the IT and electronics sector, he added.

Emerging technologies

Software Technology Parks of India joint director M.P. Dubey said that the policy outline in the budget speech would give a fillip to investments in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, IoT, data analytics and quantum computing.

He said Visakhapatnam had already emerged as a leading Tier-II hub for investments in the BPM sector, and the thrust laid on emerging technologies would lead to more startups in the AP MedTech Zone and other zones in North Andhra.

Mr. Dubey said encouragement to data parks and electronics and incentivising startups would provide new job avenues and promote a culture of innovation.

A startup promoter said that the budget thrust on promoting young entrepreneurs with easy funding and tax holiday was a welcome initiative.

Narayana and president-elect Sridhar Kosaraju welcomed the focus on investments in data parks, creation of a seed fund to encourage startups and promote new technologies in the health sector and quantum computing to increase speed of computers.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/budget-will-give-a-push-to-it-sector-in-city-say-stakeholders/article30716567.ece
181,2020/02/02,"State given a raw deal, says YSRCP","Terming as disappointing the Union Budget for 2020-21, the YSR Congress Party has said that Andhra Pradesh got a raw deal in its allocations.

Speaking to reporters after the budget presentation in New Delhi, party general secretary and leader in Parliament V. Vijaya Sai Reddy said there was no mention of Special Category Status (SCS) for the State, a long-standing demand of the party. The party expected incentives and new schemes, but there was no such mention of them. Even the ₹24,350 crore assured for the development of seven backward districts was not taken into consideration.

The MP said Polavaram Irrigation Project should have been included in the list of Central projects for which funds were allocated. The injustice done to Andhra Pradesh after the bifurcation of the State had to be rectified and the Centre was obliged to explain how the Budget would address the need for providing basic amenities, he said.

There was no clarity on the Centre’s claim that the income of the farmers would be doubled, Mr. Reddy said. Since Andhra Pradesh was an agro-based State, the Centre had to make adequate allocation to the agriculture sector to achieve its goal of doubling the income of farmers. The 18% GST on online education was too high and should be reduced.

Projects

There was no allocation for new railway lines in Andhra Pradesh, neither were funds allocated for the development of airports. Andhra Pradesh should be given special allocation under comprehensive water supply scheme for the 100 water-stressed districts, he said.

However, the Union Budget was positive on some aspects. The changes made in the income tax regime were good. The decision to spend ₹2.38 lakh crore on irrigation projects and the allocation of ₹3.6 lakh crore for Jal Jeevan Mission were laudable, he said.

The Centre should allocate funds to the States with the concept of a holistic development of the country and not with a partisan view, Mr. Reddy added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/66anx3/article30716554.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02ONGSAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/state-given-a-raw-deal-says-ysrcp/article30716555.ece
182,2020/02/02,"History skewed towards Delhi, says former CEC","N. Gopalaswami, former Chief Election Commissioner of India and the Chancellor of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, opined that Indian history taught at the school-level is largely skewed towards Delhi and mostly pertains to the northern region of the country. He added that the history pertaining to kingdoms and incidents of historical significance from other regions are grossly missing in the historical narrative in the country.

Speaking after inaugurating the 14th Tirupati Book Festival organised by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s Tirupati Kendra at S.V. High School grounds here on Saturday, Mr. Gopalaswami said that he saw a pertinent need for the curriculum to accommodate glorious chapters pertaining to the rest of India.

Recalling how he studied at a Tamil-medium school living at his grandfather’s house, Mr. Gopalaswami credited Sri Ramakrishna Vivekananda and Bhavan’s Publications for helping him get through English texts. The Padma Bhushan awardee also recalled how the much-acclaimed works of Chakravarti Rajagopalachari and Munshi Premchand ushered a sea change in his perspective of issues.

N. Ramanuja, president of N.P. Birla Institute of Management and the founder chairman of Bhavan’s Bengaluru Kendra, emphasised on digitisation of Bhavan’s Publications and making them search-enabled for a better outreach of the books.

Similarly, making the valued regional language publications available in English would enhance their acceptance, citation and quotability at the academic level, Mr. Gopalaswami said.

Bhavan’s honorary director N. Satyanarayana Raju said 90 publication houses from various States had come here with their wide array of books and appealed to the denizens to make use of the opportunity.

Addressing the protesters, joint secretary Chilakalapudi Kaladhar and vice-president M.N.K. Prasad said that LIC was started in 1956 with a seed capital of ₹5 crore, without any financial assistance from the Central government.

“Every year, LIC has been giving ₹2,000 crore dividend to the government, besides contributing thousands of crores for Five-Year Plans, drinking water schemes, irrigation schemes, municipalities and for the farmers’ cause,” the protesters said.

In a separate protest, members of the Insurance Corporation Employees’ Union demonstrated their resentment against the proposed privatisation and listing of the LIC on the stock market by resorting to a ‘gate meeting’. A large number of LIC employees and agents participated in the protest.

Union general secretary G.

185,2020/02/02,Cabinet expansion turns ‘complicated’ again,"Armed with a clearance from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central leadership, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa seems to have made up his mind on the list of 13 leaders to be inducted into his Cabinet. The development has triggered dissatisfaction and resulted in intense lobbying — from both long-time members of the BJP and those who joined the party recently and won the bypolls in December 2019 — making Cabinet expansion “a complicated exercise” again.

The announcement on Sunday morning that the expansion would happen on Thursday has given hope to aspirants that there may be room for changes, if they lobbied hard.

Aravind Limbavali

The Chief Minister has reportedly finalised the names of senior MLAs Umesh Katti and Aravind Limbavali, and C.P. Yogeshwar, who lost the Assembly election, for induction. While the choice of Mr. Yogeshwar has turned most controversial, the choice of the other two has also been disputed since then.

“We are forced to make 10 MLAs from among the new entrants to the party as Ministers, thereby reducing the opportunity for loyal BJP workers. On the top of it, candidates who lost elections are also being made Ministers, angering MLAs,” a senior Minister said.

Mr. Yogeshwar played a key role in toppling the erstwhile Congress–JD(S) coalition government, and he has recently reported to have become close to the RSS. “He spearheaded the recent RSS campaign on Kapalabetta and brought [sangh strongman] Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat to Kanakapura,” a senior BJP leader said, and added that party was keen on a Vokkaliga face in Ramanagaram district to take on H.D. Kumaraswamy and D.K. Shivakumar.

A section of BJP MLAs aspiring to become Ministers, have raked up the issue of a CD allegedly showing Mr. Limbavali in a compromising position, to scuttle his chances. Sources close to Mr. Limbavali, however, said forensic tests had debunked the veracity of the visuals in the CD and termed the issue a systematic campaign against him.

Sub-sect lobby

Murugesh Nirani has reportedly been lobbying in the party, arguing for representation to Panchamasalis, the largest sub-sect among Lingayats. He has argued that Banajiga, a smaller but influential sub-sect, was being given over-representation. Mr. Katti is a Banajiga, and so are Mr. Yediyurappa and senior Ministers Jagadish Shettar and V. Somanna.

A long list of ministerial aspirants in the BJP has emerged. Supporters of Chitradurga MLA G.H. Thippa Reddy protested outside the BJP office in the district demanding that he be made a Minister. Nehru Olekar, S.A. Ramdas, S. Angara, M.P. Kumaraswamy, Raju Gowda, Gulihatti Shekar, and Sunil Kumar are among the others lobbying hard to secure a Cabinet berth, sources said. A few of these aspirants reportedly held a meeting and decided to oppose the choice of the Chief Minister, sources said.

Minutes after the Chief Minister said he would be inducting only 10 of the 11 MLAs who won in the bypolls, Mahesh Kumathalli, Athani MLA and a close associate of Ramesh Jarkiholi, said he was reportedly not being inducted and added that he was “deeply hurt”.

Reminding the Chief Minister that he had publicly assured him twice of being made a Minister, Mr. Kumathalli said, “I sacrificed my MLA post trusting Mr. Yediyurappa. Now he is asking me to sacrifice again. I am ready to do whatever job he assigns me, including sweeping the floor of the BJP office.” He demanded that the Chief Minister at least make A.H. Vishwanath, a Minister instead of him.

Later in the day, Mr. Jarikholi met Mr. Yediyurappa. The Chief Minister is said to have tasked him with convincing Mr. Kumathalli.

This is expected to help wild animals beat water stress and tide over the greater part of the scorching summer that has already set in and will last till pre-monsoon showers lash the national park normally in mid-May.

There are 370 big and small waterholes in Bandipur and 85% of them are full, while a few smaller ones have witnessed depletion.

The critical months tend to be February and March by when a majority of the waterholes dry up, resulting in severe stress for animals scouring for fodder and water. But this year, the depletion of water levels will take a little longer owing to late showers.

T. Balachandra, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, told The Hindu that they do not foresee any severe water crisis this year as major water sources are full. In areas of water stress, solar-powered borewells will help replenish the tanks.

“There are 37 solar-powered borewells that will function to replenish the waterholes periodically so that the water stress is minimised,” he added.

The solar-powered borewells have been installed in areas of high animal density and have come in handy as sunlight will keep the pumps on during the day to ensure adequate supply that will fill up the waterholes. The water table in the 874 sq km national park is not constant and varies across different ranges and the location of the borewells are based on water availability and requirement of wildlife. Mr. Balachandra said though the fire season was on and summer had set in, there were still patches of greenery and moisture as a result of which summer may not be long drawn this season.

Similarly, in the distant M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary, there are around 100 waterholes apart from two rivers — Cauvery and Palar — of which the Cauvery is perennial while the flow in Palar is expected to last till the end of March. “Though we don’t expect severe water stress for animals this year, about 10 solar-powered pump sets have been installed, some of which are required for our anti-poaching camps,” said V. Yedukondalu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary.

He said the water pumped to the anti-poaching camps are also being flown to the waterholes to ensure that they are replenished. Besides, there are three ranges — Hugyam, M.M. Hills and Palar — in M.M. Hills division, which received rains recently and so the onset of water distress will be delayed and shorten the days of scarcity, said Mr. Yedukondalu.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/waoh8n/article30720907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGWATERHOLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/prolonged-monsoon-revives-waterholes-in-bandipur/article30720908.ece
187,2020/02/02,Schooling and skilling must go together: V-P,"Expressing concern over the low level of employability among the educated youth in the country, Vice-President of India M. Venkaiah Naidu has said that it was time now for revisiting the education system and ensuring that schooling and skilling went together.

He was addressing a public gathering after inaugurating the ‘Deshpande Skilling Centre‘, a skill development centre off Airport Road, and interacting with students here on Saturday.

Terming the large young Indian population as a demographic dividend, which provided great opportunities and also challenges, Mr. Naidu said that education should also lead to enlightenment, enhancement of knowledge, empowerment, and employability. The new education policy should also address the issues of skilling and scaling as the country has a huge manpower.

Mr. Naidu said: “Acquiring and upgrading skills is crucial as the world around is changing rapidly. In a country which is known for unity in diversity, creating opportunities is important. And in this regard, industries should try to establish better linkage with educational institutions like it is done in the West to train and create opportunities for the youth,” he said.

The Vice-President advised the students not to forget their mother tongue in their craze for learning new languages, particularly English. “Learning English is good. But don’t become an Englishman. Let the medium be English, but culture should remain Indian,” he said.

Giving tips to youngsters on what they should remember while they try to achieve something in their lives, he asked them not to forget their mother, mother tongue, motherland, guru (teacher), and culture of the land. He also asked them to be positive in their approach and shun negativism.

Maintaining that loan waiver was not a solution to the problems of farmers, the Vice-President stressed the need for efforts to increase yield, create facilities for storage and value addition so that the yield fetched better prices, better credit facilities to the farmers, newer ideas in farming, and better marketing for the farm products.

People’s contribution

Mr. Naidu said that there was a need for everyone to be part of the country’s development. “You should not leave everything to the government. Non-governmental organisations have a great role in development by joining hands with the government and people should also contribute,” he said.

The Vice-President appealed to the people of the country not to indulge in violence as it would spoil their future because ultimately, the losses would be recovered from them through increase in tariff and taxes. He also appealed to the youngsters not to miss any opportunity to go out of the country in search of jobs or for higher education but requested them to earn and return to their motherland to give back to the society.

Mentioning that only 4.9% of the graduates in the country had the required skills, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi lauded the initiative taken by serial entrepreneur Gururaj Deshpande for helping the students acquire skills and asked the students to make efforts to learn other languages.

Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar briefed about the government initiatives and lauded Mr. Deshpande for giving back to the society.

189,2020/02/02,NGOs object to proposal to slash MGNREGA scheme budget,"Some NGOs have objected to the Union government’s proposal to slash the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme budget for the coming year. They are apprehensive that it will continue to reduce rural spending.

“This is a negative step, definitely. It will have a serious detrimental impact on the rural economy,” said Sidagouda Modagi, farmers’ leader and president of the Bharatiya Krishik Samaj district unit on Sunday.

He said that the Union Budget reduced allocation to the scheme by around ₹9,000 crore, which means a 13% reduction in outlay.

“It is wrong to think that the villages are disconnected from the national economy. If farm distress is resolved, the Indian economy would automatically improve. Farmers, and landless labourers are consumers of various goods and services. To do that, they need money and MNREGA helps them by pushing up the wages and creating jobs. Reducing allocation is a retrograde step,” he said.

“Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman kept talking about leaving more money in the hands of the common man. The easiest way to do it was to ensure effective implementation of MNREGA and increased allocation for the rural jobs scheme,” says Jayashree Gurannanavar, farmers’ leader.

“Apart from stemming migration to cities, MNREGA had the direct effect of making landless labourers self-reliant. But the government does not seem to want to do that. That is unfortunate,” she said.

“We were not surprised by the announcement. This was expected,” says Dileep Kamat, a founding member of the Grameena Kooli Karmikara Sangha that works to ensure that the benefits of the scheme reach a larger number of people.

“MNREGA is one of the most progressive Acts in recent decades. It is a scheme to preserve and protect the self respect of a villager. But that does not seem to be happening,” he said.

``On the one hand, the government says it is worried about the economy. On the other, it take steps that can further damage the economy. If the government was really serious about increasing the pace of economic development, it should have supplemented the MNREGA with funds. It is sad that the government is neglecting aspirations of 70% of the population,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ngos-object-to-proposal-to-slash-mgnrega-scheme-budget/article30720144.ece

192,2020/02/02,Yoga needs to be made into people’s movement: Naidu,"Referring to the growing instances of non-communicable disease (NCDs), Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu has stressed upon the need for converting national programmes like ‘Fit India’ and ‘Yoga Day’ into a people’s movement.

The Vice President was speaking at the five-day mega yoga camp conducted by Baba Ramdev of Patanjali Yogpeeth here on Sunday.

Mr. Naidu called upon the younger generation to shun a sedentary life style and develop the habit of performing exercise regularly.

The Vice President termed yoga as the cheapest medicine for one’s health and said it benefited people of all ages.

He pointed out that the economic burden of non-communicable diseases in terms of lost productivity and expenses for treatment, among others, in India is estimated to be around $6.2 trillion between 2021 and 2030.

“Yoga is India’s greatest legacy and its most glorious gift to the world”, he said. Emphasising the need for practising yoga regularly, Mr. Naidu appealed to the people not to limit the practice to just the ‘Yoga Day’.

“We need a transformation in the way we live, the way we think and the way we interact with our fellow human beings and Mother Nature. I believe that Yoga will be a powerful tool to bring about the desired transformation in people who practice it regularly,” he said.

Mr. Naidu also called upon the people particularly youths to focus on protection of nature and preservation of the ancient culture, which he said could lead to better future.

193,2020/02/02,‘Development shouldn’t hit quality of life’,"“With rapid urbanisation everywhere, there is dire need for building efficient mass transportation infrastructure apart from encouraging non-polluting electric vehicles. The government must provide the right policy environment to facilitate the same,” Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu said here on Sunday.

He was addressing a gathering here on Sunday, after formally inaugurating the 22.5-km Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (HD-BRTS).

HDBRTS has been on a trial run for a year and ferries 1 lakh passengers daily.

Mr. Naidu said that simply building infrastructure was not enough and that there was need for a behavioural change among urban dwellers to take to mass transportation.

The V-P said that urbanisation was a reality and India’s population was migrating towards cities.

“However, rapid urbanisation has its own set of challenges which have to be addressed in a holistic manner by the urban planners. While 55% of the world population is already living in urban areas, it is estimated to reach 68% by 2050. And India is expected to contribute a staggering 416 million urban dwellers to this number,” he said.

Mr. Naidu said that steps should be taken to ensure that they did not affect the environment and human health, particularly that of children. “Development must not happen at the cost of quality of life. I strongly believe that we need a proactive model of urbanisation rather than a reactive one,” he said.

Mr. Naidu said that the Union government had taken up several programmes and schemes to improve urban mobility.

A National Urban Policy Framework 2018 (NUPF) had been envisioned and collaboration between the State and the Union governments was essential for sustainable urban development and so also a strong public-private partnership, he said.

Emphasising that smart and beautiful cities were built by smart and beautiful citizens, the Vice President appealed to individuals and organisations to join hands with the government for ensuring sustainable development. He also stressed the need for making new urban infrastructure low-carbon, green and climate-resilient.

Lauding the efforts that had gone to designing and implementing the HD-BRTS, the Vice President called on the people to make best use of the public transport which has already won ‘Best Mass Transit Award’ for 2019.

Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi said that amid hurdles and delay the HDBRTS had been completed and the pending issues would be sorted out soon.

Briefing about the project, Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar said that out of the total cost of ₹970.87 crore, ₹622.06 crore was borne by the State government, while ₹324.32 crore was raised from the World Bank.

The project received Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant of ₹24.49 crore.

Deputy Chief Ministers Laxman Savadi and Govind Karjol, former Minister Basavaraj Horatti, a host of elected representatives and officials were present.

Commissioner of Directorate of Urban Land Transport V. Ponnuraj welcomed the gathering while Managing Director of HDBRTS Rajendra Cholan proposed vote of thanks.

194,2020/02/02,"Deeply hurt, says Karnataka BJP MLA Mahesh Kumathalli who may be denied Cabinet post","Mahesh Kumathalli, who left the Congress to join the BJP and won the recent byelection and now rumoured to be not made a Minister, openly expressed his disappointment against the BJP on Sunday.

“I sacrificed my MLA post to come to the BJP. There are reports that they don’t want to induct me into the Cabinet. I will not stoop to their level and ask why. They are asking me to sacrifice again. I am ready to do that, but it has deeply hurt me. I will do whatever [Chief Minister] Yediyurappa assigns me to. I am ready to even sweep the floor of BJP office,” said Mr. Kumathalli who won from Athani, Belagavi district.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, during the byelection campaign and when he visited Belagavi last week, said all the three MLAs from Belagavi would be made Ministers. “Now, the Chief Minister seems to have changed his mind. I won’t ask why, but will remind him that I have come to the BJP trusting him,” the Athani MLA said.

Laxman Savadi, BJP candidate for 2018 Assembly polls, was defeated by Mr. Kumathalli who contested on Congress ticket and later resigned and joined the BJP. However, the BJP high command made Mr. Savadi Deputy Chief Minister. The high command reportedly blocked the name of Mr. Kumathalli on the grounds that the same Assembly constituency could not be given two Ministries, especially when a Deputy Chief Minister in the government is from the same constituency. Responding to this, Mr. Kumathalli asked did the BJP not know that he was from the same constituency when he joined the party.

Mr. Kumathalli is now demanding that since Mr. Yediyurappa and the BJP do not want to induct him into the Cabinet, they should at least make A.H. Vishwanath, who lost the bypolls, a Minister. Mr. Vishwanath, who the party has refused to make a Minister, has now threatened to write a tell-all book on how the previous Congress-JD(S) coalition government was toppled to bring the BJP to power.

At a press conference on Sunday, Mr. Yediyurappa said the Supreme Court judgment was very clear that those defeated in the bypolls could not be made Ministers. “There are technical difficulties.

This is the first time the Chief Minister has announced a date for the expansion, ending several weeks of speculation.

He said on Sunday that the formula for expansion was “10+3”, meaning 10 from among the party-hopper MLAs who recently won the byelection and three from among the old-timers. When asked who among those who won the bypoll would not be made a Minister, he refused to divulge names and asked to wait and watch.

Asked about the regional imbalance in the Cabinet if all those who have won bypolls were inducted into the Cabinet, the Chief Minister said: “It is because of the resignation of 17 MLAs that our government has come [to power] and I have become Chief Minister. We can’t see regional and caste imbalances now. Even if you were in my position, you would have done the same”.

Speaking of R.

199,2020/02/02,Union Budget: LIC staff stage protest against disinvestment plan,"The Union Budget for 2020-21 has evoked strong reactions from various stakeholders with LIC employees staging a flash demonstration on learning that the government plans to partially disinvest from LIC.

The announcement of partial disinvestment was made around 12.30 p.m. during the budget speech by the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and the employees immediately gathered in front of their respective offices and staged a demonstration.

More than 100 LIC employees including officers gathered in front of the main office at the Millennium Circle and displayed their outrage over the government’s decision. A senior employee of the LIC said it was spontaneous and was held across the country.

Meanwhile, union leaders pointed out that ₹1.5 lakh crore was released by LIC for National Highways development besides approving ₹15 lakh crore for the railway infrastructure development. “The LIC has also funded the government’s social welfare programmes and hence the partial disinvestment was a step in the wrong direction,” said the leaders.

The All India LIC Employees’ Association said it strongly opposes the move of the government. At present the government holds 100% stakes in LIC. The domestic savings of the policy holders helps capital formation and is utilised for development activities of the country. The LIC has funded to the tune of 80% of its total investment in the social sector and the five-year plans,” the association said.

They said LIC has contributed almost 25% to the total budgetary efforts of the Government of India and hence selling a portion of its stakes and disinvesting in it would deliver a strong blow to resource mobilisation efforts. The association urged the government to drop the proposed move in the interest of nearly 40 crore policy holders.

Meanwhile, the Mysuru Industries’ Association has described the Union Budget 2020-21 as insipid and devoid of any flavour.

MIA president Vasu, a former Congress MLA, said the reduction in the Income Tax slab rates upto an income of ₹15 lakh per annum, and the concomitant withdrawal of tax rebates that were being provided all these years, amounts to fooling the salaried class. He said there is no substantial benefit to the salaried class who have been told that the new tax regime is optional which adds to the confusion.

The only positive take away from the budget was the thrust on solar power production and establishment of export promotional centres in districts, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ejd26r/article30716630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGMYSURULIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/union-budget-lic-staff-stage-protest-against-disinvestment-plan/article30716631.ece

Cropping patterns for 23 AEUs in five agro-ecological zones (AEZ) are laid out in the report, ‘New approach for agricultural development in Kerala — Delineation of agro-ecological zones and recommended cropping patterns.’ In a nutshell, it lists crops that can be grown sustainably in a region and those that are better avoided. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan released the report last week.

For its preparation, the KAU adopted the 2010 Kerala State Planning Board recommendations for AEZ-based agriculture, but with modifications.

Five zones

Coastal plains, midland laterites, foothills, high hills and the Palakkad eastern plains constitute the five AEZs. The division is based on geomorphology, land use and soil variability. In the aftermath of the 2018 and 2019 floods, the KAU had been assigned the task of revisiting the concept of zones and designing a AEU-based package of practices.

“We have suggested cropping patterns based on certain broad principles. For instance, we do not recommend growing tuber crops in areas with a slope of more than 30 degrees, as the soil could loosen post-harvest,” P. Indira Devi, Director (Research), KAU, said.

To ensure a gradual adoption of the recommendations by farmers, the government could introduce policies promoting crops suited to each AEU and encourage their cultivation, she said. Taking the exercise to the next level, KAU also plans to bring out AEU-level management protocols for each crop, according to her.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/eco-zone-based-cropping-patterns-mooted/article30721314.ece
202,2020/02/02,Spirit seizure in T.N. keeps Excise department on its toes,"The seizure of 16,000 litres of illicit spirit by Tamil Nadu Police from a godown in Coimbatore recently has alerted the State Excise Department to the spectre of arrack-fortified synthetic toddy flooding the State.

The Tamil Nadu Police had found the contraband spirit stacked in a warehouse at Varanthirapally, near Chinna Kannoor, in Tirupur.

Quoting their counterparts in Tamil Nadu, State Excise Department officials said inter-State smugglers had sourced the stuff from sugarcane processing regions in north India for sale to toddy shop licencees in Kerala.

The smugglers appeared to have squeezed maximum advantage out of the relaxed scrutiny in border check-posts following the advent of the (GST) regime to smuggle illicit spirit into Kerala .

The excise officers did not rule out the existence of more such spirit godowns in TN.

The Excise Department has stepped up its monitoring of toddy sold through licensed outlets in Alappuzha, Thrissur, Kottayam and Palakkad. At least some of these outlets allegedly sell synthetic toddy laced with potent illicit spirit.

Artificial toddy

An official said the quick and hidden process of making artificial toddy laced with illicit spirit from dubious sources could endanger public health and open the door for the retail of toxic liquor to unsuspecting consumers.

The estimated production cost of genuine toddy is ₹70 a litre by a conservative estimate. However, the same quantity of bootleg toddy can be manufactured for less than ₹10.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/spirit-seizure-in-tn-keeps-excise-dept-on-its-toes/article30721285.ece
203,2020/02/02,Focus on cover-up to save Sriram,"A magistrate court here is scheduled to consider on Monday the status of the Crime Branch (CB) investigation against IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman.

The police had implicated the officer in a drunk driving accident that caused the death of journalist K.M. Basheer in August last.

The court is monitoring the investigation at the behest of Basheer’s newspaper, Siraj.

Accusation

The Siraj management had accused the police of having helped Mr. Venkitaraman erase incriminating evidence against him.

In a court filing, the newspaper alleged sub-inspector, Museum, Jayaprakash had “helped the bureaucrat dodge” the mandatory blood test to detect alcohol impairment, if any.

The officer also allegedly stacked the odds in favour of the accused by “failing” to video record the accident scene, identify the driver and record the statement of witnesses. Instead, the police hustled Mr. Venkitaraman away to the General Hospital (GH) and from there to a private a multi-specialty hospital, disobeying an order referring the accused to the Government Medical College Hospital here.

The police also allowed Mr. Venkitaraman’s co-passenger, Wafa Firoz, to leave the scene without verifying her identity or recording her statement.

Charge-sheet

The CB has reportedly charge-sheeted the case. However, the details are yet to emerge in the public domain.

It is unclear whether the agency has indicted Mr. Jayaprakash for destruction of evidence, a demand raised in the court by the Siraj management and journalists’ unions.

The CB had earlier indicted Mr. Venkitaraman for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, causing disappearance of evidence and dangerous driving.

The CB had also arraigned Ms. Wafa as an accused.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/focus-on-cover-up-to-save-sriram/article30721283.ece
204,2020/02/02,Affected student stable,"The condition of the student who has been affected by novel coronavirus infection and kept in isolation at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) here was satisfactory on Sunday. No new case has been reported in the district.

As one new case has been reported in Alappuzha, samples of 30 people who had come in contact with the patient and those who returned from Wuhan after January 15 have been sent to the Virology Institute, Alappuzha.

22 under surveillance

In all, 22 people, including six admitted in the past 24 hours, are kept under surveillance in various hospitals in Thrissur district. There are seven persons in Thrissur General Hospital and 15 in the MCH. In all, 133 people are in house quarantine in the district.

Ninety-six isolation rooms set up in various hospitals in the district. Service of 1,148 doctors and 973 paramedical staff have been arranged. Sufficient number of safety equipment are made available. Ten ambulances have been arranged to bring people who are in home quarantine to hospitals, if need be.

The Health Department officials have traced 38 people from various districts who travelled with the student undergoing treatment in Thrissur from Kolkata to Nedumbassery.

The Health Department has warned stringent action against people who had returned from China and refused to obey home quarantine instructions.

The police arrested two more persons who spread fake news about nCoV. The arrested are Shajitha Jamal, 41, of Perinjanam and Shamla, 43, of Kodungalloor.

As the virus has 28 days of incubation, people have to be careful, according to the health officials. People who are in home quarantine should not attend schools or offices. Those who have diabetes and heart disease should be careful.

Video to be screened

An awareness video brought out by the Health Department on correct facts related to nCoV will be screened in all schools in the State on Monday. A statement from the Director of General Education said that there were a lot of apprehension and confusion about nCoV. The video would help put forth facts about the virus for the benefit of students and teachers. It would be available through the Victers channel and on https://victers.kite.kerala.gov.in. The video will be broadcast at 2 p.m., 3 p.m., and 4 p.m.

205,2020/02/02,Ecumenical meet ends in Lebanon,"Theological discussions between the Catholic and Oriental Orthodox churches, hosted by Patriarch of the Syrian Orthodox Church Mor Ignatios Aphrem II, ended in Lebanon.

The discussions were held between January 26 and 31, said a communication from the Jacobite Syrian Church here.

The Patriarch said the series of discussions over the last 16 years had resulted in the Catholic and Oriental churches coming closer and their mutual understanding noticeable.

Circumstances

The Patriarch explained the circumstances in which representatives from the Indian Orthodox church could not take part in the discussions.

He said that efforts were being made by members of the other Christian churches and the State government with regard to the dispute within the Malankara church in India.

Papers on the theology of sacraments were presented during the theological meeting, said the communication.

A committee has been constituted to develop a common document based on these presentations, the communication said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ecumenical-meet-ends-in-lebanon/article30721183.ece
206,2020/02/02,K.G. Simon still in charge of Koodathayi probe,"State Police Chief Loknath Behera on Sunday said the transfer of District Police Chief (Kozhikode Rural) K.G. Simon to Pathanamthitta district would in no way affect the ongoing investigation into the Koodathayi serial murder case.

Speaking to reporters during a district-level police adalat, Mr. Behera clarified that Mr. Simon, who was the head of the Special Investigation team, would continue as supervising officer along with the new role and give the required support to the team members.

On allegations that the police were yet to gather concrete evidence against the arrested in the case, he said the investigation was being done on the basis of strong evidence, and that the remaining part of it was with the forensic investigation team. “Cracking a case after 14 long years was a big challenge. But our investigators did it, making all of us proud,” he added.

On Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) cases against Alan Shuhaib and Thaha Fasal for their alleged link with Maoist functionaries, Mr. Behera said he would not be able to comment on the issue as the case was currently being probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).

“In this case, the police speak only on the basis of concrete evidence,” he explained.

Awareness measures

Referring to the field-level awareness measures taken up by the police to reduce incidents of child abuse, Mr. Behera said he had directed officers to be keen on gathering scientific evidence against suspects while registering cases under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. “The conviction rate in POCSO cases is less because the victims turn hostile in most cases. Around 90% of suspects in such cases are either related to the victims’ families, and increasing the conviction rate is a huge challenge,” he said.

According to Mr. Behera, the opening of the proposed special courts for POCSO cases would be a big step to end the delay in trials and improve conviction rate.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kg-simon-still-in-charge-of-koodathayi-probe/article30721135.ece
207,2020/02/02,"Just proposals, no action","Amidst recurring incidents involving houseboats, recommendations made by a committee, headed by the then Tourism Secretary Suman Billa that looked into houseboat safety following the January 2013 tragedy that resulted in the death of four tourists at the Punnamada finishing point, continue to remain in cold storage.

Among the recommendations were the constitution of an authority with more powers, setting up a special police station at Punnamada, and measures to deal with fire incidents aboard the boat.

According to houseboat operators, steps should be taken to set up at least three mobile units of Fire and Rescue Services Department one each at Alappuzha terminal, Pallathuruthy, and Kumarakom. “It is a long-pending demand to set up mobile units. But, the government is yet to heed our calls. The government should also provide training to crew members in emergency response and evacuation,” said a houseboat operator.

Although, the Tourism Department has installed Global Positioning System (GPS) in registered houseboats, a large number of boats without registration continue to ply without installing GPS and other safety measures.

The move to publish details of authorised houseboats on the website of the District Tourism Promotion Council remains inconclusive.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/just-proposals-no-action/article30721101.ece
208,2020/02/02,Pollution at its peak,"The proliferation of houseboats has played a part in raising pollution levels, especially faecal pollution, in Vembanad Lake, a designated Ramsar site.

Recently, a study carried under the aegis of the Alappuzha unit of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) has revealed the presence of high levels of coliform bacteria in Vembanad Lake, especially at Punnamada, a houseboat boarding point. The total coliform count in water collected from Punnamada was 8,000 Most Probable Number (MPN)/100 ml in April 2019, against the permissible limit of 500 MPN/100 ml. It stood at 4,000/100 ml and 2,000/100 ml in May and June, 2019. Officials said illegal houseboats were discharging waste water directly into the waterbody, with the Vembanad lake ecosystem taking the brunt.

Adding to the woes is a dysfunctional sewage treatment plant (STP) at H-Block. The plant operated by the District Tourism Council was closed several months ago after the KSPCB found flaws in its functioning, forcing the boats to discharge waste water directly into the lake.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pollution-at-its-peak/article30721094.ece
209,2020/02/02,A deal is sealed for smooth sail,"Chugging along sleepy canals, stopping at select points or cruising to a village destination, the backwater landscape of Kottayam accommodates too many boats offering rides to visitors.

Some of these vessels, according to authorities, operate without licence while a few lack adequate security gears. A few have deployed untrained crew, further adding to the safety concerns.

Taking a serious note of these violations, a stakeholder meeting of the houseboat industry in Kottayam has laid out a mutually agreed set of rules with regard to the operation of houseboats stationed in the district. The boats have been allotted time till March 31 to comply with the guidelines, which will be followed by periodical inspections by the Port Department officials.

As per the pact, only houseboats possessing licences issued by the Port Authority in Alappuzha will be permitted to ply on Vembanad Lake. The step comes in view of luxury boats conducting unauthorised operations in the region with licences secured from ports in Kollam or Kodungallur.

Fee waiver sought from PCB

Alongside the licence, the authorities have also made it mandatory for the boats to secure ‘No Objection Certificate’ from the Pollution Control Board (PCB) for operating tourist cruises. Based on a request by the houseboat owners, the Collector has agreed to hold discussions with the PCB on granting a waiver in the one-time payment of fee for a period of five years.

Further, the boats are also required to register with the local body where their anchoring point is situated. “Safety gears should be kept in the vicinity of passengers. Before going on each cruise, the crew is required to apprise the visitors about how to use each safety equipment – both in English and in Malayalam,” said P.K. Sudheer Babu, District Collector, Kottayam.

The food factor

The crew members, who should be recruited on the basis of qualification and experience, will have to wear uniforms. A strict ban has been imposed on the recruitment of migrant workers as boat crew. The authorities will provide adequate training to the crew members in rescue operations. Similarly, only boats possessing licence from the Food Safety Authority will be permitted to serve food to the tourists on board. A decision with regard to ensuring adequate toilet facilities on board too has been agreed upon.

The authorities, meanwhile, are in the final stages of constructing a boat, which will collect waste directly from the house boats .

The meeting, convened by the District Collector, was also attended by representatives of the house boat owners association, DTPC secretary Bindu Nair and Biju Varghese, the Deputy Director of Tourism, among others.

As per estimates, about 120-odd house boats besides 60 Shikara boats carry out tourist operations in the Kottayam district. Majority of these vessels are stationed across the boat landing points at Kumarakom, Kaippuzhamuttu, Cheepungal, and Kavanattinkara.

Meanwhile, official sources pointed at the absence of a fire station with a speed boat at Kumarakom as a major lacuna in the district’s tourism sector. Though a proposal to establish one near the Agricultural University campus here had been mooted earlier, no follow-up action was initiated afterwards.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kwj0qr/article30721075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2tval3-HB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-deal-is-sealed-for-smooth-sail/article30721076.ece
210,2020/02/02,Cruise with a catch,"They boarded a houseboat from Kumarakom around 11 a.m. on January 23, and lazed around on the boat deck, relishing the ride through the idyllic waters and surveying village life on the shores of Vembanad Lake.

But, their jaunt did not last long. When the houseboat reached near Pathiramanal island in Alappuzha district around 1.15 p.m., the passengers had the scare of their lives. A fire, which reportedly started near the kitchen soon began to consume the double-decker houseboat. The group, among them two infants, a four-year-old boy, six women and four men, had little time to contemplate and they jumped into the water. They survived as all of them landed where the water level remained low.

No driver

A probe revealed that the houseboat had been flouting norms — without mandatory registration, pollution clearance and third party insurance — since 2013. The most shocking part is that the vessel was cruising without a driver and life-saving gear. Apart from the srank, other crew members in the boat lacked licences. According to officials, the houseboat had illegally conducted at least 20 trips in the past one month alone.

It was not an isolated incident involving houseboats in Alappuzha backwaters. On September 23, 2018, 32 tourists had a narrow escape when two houseboats collided near Pallathuruthy. The police then arrested a person on charges of driving it without a valid licence. Prior to this, on April 3, 2018, a two-year-old girl from Thane in Maharashtra lost her life after falling from a houseboat at Kainakary. A seven-year-old boy drowned in Vembanad Lake at Kannitta Jetty, on April 13, 2018.

With recurring accidents, proliferation of houseboats far in excess of the carrying capacity of the backwaters and illegal operations in the absence of regulation, the houseboat industry, which is yet to fully recover from the back-to-back floods, has found itself in a predicament. “It is a sector without regulation, to say the least. There is an urgent need to rein in houseboats violating rules and safety guidelines. After all, tourism is affected. If we cannot ensure safety, tourists will stop coming. The entire backwater tourism sector will be in peril,” said a Tourism Department official.

24x7 service

In the early days, houseboats operated only during the peak tourism season. However, tourist activity in the area has exploded unimaginably and the houseboat industry transformed itself into a 24x7 service, turning into a multi-crore business. As per a report of the Centre for Water Resources Development and Management (CWRDM), Kozhikode, the recreational carrying capacity of the lake is 262 boats.

Based on the report, the government had imposed a ban on new houseboats in Alappuzha after December 31, 2013, but with little effect. Houseboat numbers have been on an upward spiral.

According to the Ports Department, the licensing authority, the number of registered houseboats in the backwaters stood at 775. However, they are clueless on the actual number of illegal houseboats.

“We received 316 applications for registration during an adalat conducted last year. However, inspections revealed that most of the boats were built in violation of rules and we rejected their applications. The number of houseboats operating without a licence would be much higher,” said an official with the Ports Department. In another assessment by authorities, following the molestation of a British national on a houseboat in December 2017, the number of boats were calculated at 1,534 with almost half of them operating with registration and certificates.

A risky affair

Non-compliance with safety measures make houseboat cruising a risky affair altogether. A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report submitted to the State Assembly in August 2017 revealed instances of houseboats being operated by the cooks, helpers, or lascars. “Houseboats were operating in the backwaters without competent crew, life-saving appliances and fire-fighting equipment. This was an indication of insufficient monitoring which in turn compromised safety of passengers,” the CAG report said.

Despite a number of unpleasant incidents, hardly any measures have been taken to rein in illegal operations. For authorities, it has become a routine to stage a public stunt following an incident, in the form of a police raid or a joint drive involving the Ports, Tourism, Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), and the police. Same was the case after the Pathiramanal incident too. No major action has been taken against the owner and crew of the houseboat, let alone steps to check violations and seize boats operating illegally.

An emergency meeting of the District Disaster Management Authority held on January 25 decided to make licence mandatory for all houseboats in the district. As per the decision, houseboats without registration will be given a time-frame to register with the Alappuzha Port of Registry. It is noteworthy that all the previous moves to restrict houseboats registered in other districts from operating in Alappuzha and bring boats without registration on board the licensing system have come a cropper.

Department’s version

The Ports Department blames lack of resources and staff for its ability to act against violators. “The Ports Department lacks people and resources to conduct inspections and rein in illegal houseboats. The only way to bring in order is by seizing illegal boats and dismantling them. But, this has to be decided at the highest level,” an official said.

Hari Achutha Warrier, regional port officer, said the proposal for an enforcement wing had stayed on paper. “It is mandatory under the Kerala Inland Vessel Rules (KIVR) to establish an enforcement wing under a Dy.SP, and assisted by a sub-inspector and police officers for periodic inspection of houseboats. The wing should patrol inland waters to ensure the safety of the passengers, including at night halt centres,” Mr. Warrier, who is also chief examiner, KIVR, and general manager (administration), Kerala Maritime Board said.

The Ports Department is not the only stakeholder in the sector. Police, KSPCB, and Tourism too play a role. “Lack of coordination among government departments helps houseboat operators defy rules. A district-level regulatory authority with representatives from the district administration, Ports, Tourism, KSPCB, police, Fire and Rescue Services will help regulate the sector,” the Tourism official suggested.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ck4gu6/article30721066.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2tval4-HB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cruise-with-a-catch/article30721067.ece
211,2020/02/02,Teachers accuse government of trying to bypass High Court order,"A section of qualified primary school teachers has accused the State government of trying to bypass a recent High Court (HC) order that made department-level tests mandatory for promotion as head teachers.

K.N. Anand, president of the Kerala Test Qualified Primary Teachers’ Union, told The Hindu on Sunday that efforts were on to retain unqualified head teachers.

Relaxation sought

The government had also approached the Centre seeking relaxation of the test qualification specified in rule 18(1) of the Kerala Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2011, he alleged. The Right to Education Act stipulates that a teacher should have at least 12 years of experience and pass department-level tests along with an examination on the Kerala Education Act and Rules (KEAR).

The Act also gave three years for head teacher aspirants to pass the mandatory Account (lower) test, conducted by the Kerala Public Service Commission, and a KEAR test. The Section 23 (2) of the Act allows relaxation of minimum qualification requirement for a period not exceeding five years if people with required qualification are not available in sufficient numbers.

A section of teachers had alleged that though the time limit was over, this was being extended forever, reportedly under pressure from influential teachers’ organisations affiliated to various political parties. The Kerala government in 2018 February issued an order making test qualification mandatory for promotion of teachers as head teachers.

However, the sub-rule (4) under 45 B in the KEAR contradicted that order as it permanently exempted a teacher aged 50 from passing the Account (lower) test, the teachers had alleged.

Indefinite exemption

Later, the Kerala Administrative Tribunal on February 25, 2019, put an end to the indefinite exemption, saying any executive order or circular from the government should not go against statutory rules.

The High Court, in its order on January 27, said that only persons who were test qualified “can be considered for promotion and be included for selection”.

The court also said that it “cannot agree with the tribunal’s order that there could be no exclusion of persons above 50 years of age who have no test qualification” . It pointed out that the tribunal had already held that granting exemption to teachers above 50 years from test qualifications “cannot be sustained in the teeth of Rule 18(1)”.

Unqualified teachers

The unqualified senior teachers would be entitled to appear for the test and acquire the test qualifications within three years.

On acquiring such qualification if any junior had been promoted earlier, within the three-year period, the senior who qualified within that period would be entitled to seek promotion as head teacher on the basis only of his/her subsequent qualification within the three-year period. In that circumstance the junior had to be reverted and the senior promoted as head teacher.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/teachers-accuse-government-of-trying-to-bypass-high-court-order/article30721061.ece

213,2020/02/02,"Marathon goes awry, runners cry foul","A marathon organised by a private sporting and adventure company in the city ended up at the Nadakkavu police station on Sunday after the participants held the organisers responsible for the mismanagement of the event.

The participants including foreign runners who turned up early on the morning accused the organisers of not keeping the promises they made earlier through various online media with regard to the prizes.

Complaint

Nadakkavu police said they took up the issue after the runners complained that they could not find the organisers at the end of the event.

In the preliminary investigation, it was found that there were not even enough volunteers to guide the participants or felicitate the winners properly at the end of the event, the police said.

The participants also locked horns with one of the event coordinators at the spot in their attempt to get back the already paid registration fee.

Many of them had made online payment to attend the event. According to the police, the organisers had collected between ₹350 and ₹550 per head as registration fee.

A police officer from Nadakkavu station said the issue was settled after an organiser agreed to refund the amount to all the registered participants.

He would be booked in case of violating the promise, the official said.

For many of the participants, it was the first experience in their life. Many of the foreign participants, who emerged as winners in the event, could not even understand the unforeseen climax.

Jayan P. Vijayan, Secretary, DTPC, on Sunday said that the renovation work of the Hill View Park which provides a panoramic view of Idukki reservoir was in the final stages. There will be a gallery, souvenir shop and resting place. Work on the footpath has been completed. An average of nearly one lakh persons visit the Hill View Park a year in addition to the daily visitors coming with families. During the festival seasons and weekends, there is a rush of tourists to the park.

Mr Vijayan said that five more adventure tourism activities will be added to the park in addition to pedal boats in the water area near the reservoir.

The Tourism Department plans to develop Cheruthoni as a major destination between Thekkady and Munnar. Tourists visiting the two main destinations also prefer to spend their time in Cheruthoni. Work on the ₹3 crore infrastructure project in Idukki Park in front of the Idukki arch has started, he said adding that 12 cottages have been built. They would be opened for tourists soon. The DTPC has nearly 100 acres of land close to the arch dam. The constructions have been done without affecting the natural landscape there. There would be a museum depicting the farm history of Idukki. The children’s park, footpath and major installations on the evolution of the district will be showcased.

Addressing a ‘Support CAA’ campaign organised by the BJP Kottayam district unit here on Sunday, the Union Minister accused the Congress and the Left parties of playing politics over the Act by keeping the people belonging to a particular religion in the front line.

“Those organising the protests should also understand that the Congress and the Left parties had earlier raised a similar demand in the Parliament. This Act intends not to oust anyone but to facilitate the return of the meritorious,” Mr. Supriyo said.

217,2020/02/02,nCoV: surveillance tightened in Kottayam,"Even as Kerala reported its second case of coronavirus, the authorities have intensified surveillance against the disease in Kottayam.

The District Health Authority will organize a training programme for the medical doctors from the various private hospitals in Kottayam on the prevention and treatment of the virus on Tuesday. The treatment protocol for the disease has already been dispatched to these institutions.

The District medical officer Jacob Varghese has directed all hospital superintendents to convene a meeting of all doctors on duty everyday and issue necessary directions to the hospital staff. The Health Department staff will not be permitted to take leave except in cases of emergency.

A control room for providing information to the public on the disease has already been opened in the district. The control room, which will operate on a round the clock basis, can be reached at 0481- 2304110 and 9495088514.

According to the DMO, the lone medical sample that was sent for examination from Kottayam has been tested negative.

Presently, there are no patients with suspected symptoms of the virus under observation at any of the hospitals. The authorities have set up isolation wards at the Government Medical College (GMC) and the General Hospitals in Kottayam. Patients having symptoms of the disease have been directed to contact Sindhu G Nair (9447347282 ) of the General hospital or Sajith Kumar (9447239277) of the GMC.

The patients have been also requested to avoid using public transportation facilities while ambulances have been arranged for shifting them to the hospitals.

218,2020/02/02,"Coronavirus: Surveillance is the key, Kerala shows the way","Kerala can take pride in its robust disease surveillance system and the sense of alertness it has managed to create among the community on the seriousness of the public health emergency that is unfolding at the global level which has helped the State pick up its second nCoV (novel Coronavirus) case in Alapuzha district.

State Health Department officials confirmed that they were anticipating more positive nCoV cases as it had become evident that Kerala has one of the highest number of students studying at Wuhan in Hubei province in China, the epicentre of the current global epidemic, and that many of them were on their way home or were already home.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has confirmed that in China, 60.5% of all cases since the start of the outbreak have been reported from Hubei province.

Even in other countries, the first reported nCoV cases were all found in people who returned from China.

Special risk

The presence of a huge student community from Kerala in China puts the State at a special risk and the Health Department has gone on an overdrive, aggressively screening and putting on surveillance, anyone with a recent travel history to China and any other nations where nCoV has been reported.

It is thus no surprise that Kerala has perhaps one of the highest number of persons – nearly 2,000 — who have been put under special surveillance and quarantine.

“It might perhaps be a bit of overkill and it is indeed a huge strain on the health system resources to keep such huge numbers under surveillance but we think that our additional vigilance will pay off. Those under home quarantine are being contacted twice daily by assigned health workers to check if they are following the home quarantine rules and if any have developed any symptoms,” a senior Health official told The Hindu

The helpline (DISHA 1056) is inundated with calls from Keralites from across the globe, especially Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan seeking advice, he added

The sense of urgency and alert created in the community has gone up after the first case tested positive.

Self reporting increased and all of a sudden, the number of people isolated in hospitals with possible symptoms shot up from single digits to over 70, he said.

Now that more positive nCoV cases would begin to be reported, the focus of the Health Department would be to ensure that all isolation and infection control protocols were followed strictly so that there was no further human-to-human spread of the disease, the State Nodal Officer for Public Health Emergencies, Amar Fettle, said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3uult/article30723886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3tvalnCoV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronovirus-surveillance-is-the-key-kerala-shows-the-way/article30720140.ece
219,2020/02/02,MVD completes porting of vehicles,"Owners of all class of motor vehicles can look forward to hassle-free service with the Motor Vehicles Department completing porting of 1.38 crore vehicles from server-based Smart Move to Vahan for vehicle registration on Thursday.

The remaining various class of motor vehicles of the total 1.43 crore registered in the State till date had been ported to Vahan by the MVD at the time of registration. With completion of the porting, vehicle particulars of all motor vehicles with registration number from 1 to 9999 is available on Vahan.

The database proved to be cumbersome as there were multiple entries for a single vehicle from various Regional Transport Offices. It took three months to complete the porting to the central data centre of Vahan housed in New Delhi.

“The registered owners will be able to get services online. We are working out details on the services that can be provided online to lessen the visit RTO offices,” Joint Transport Commissioner Rajeev Puthalath told The Hindu.

The MVD will soon take steps to link emission-related data of vehicles with the Vahan as directed by the Supreme Court. To curb the illegal way of fitments of speed governors in heavy vehicles, the official said it would also be made online so that only an authorised vendor can execute the work.

Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) interceptors rolled out as part of adopting a digital enforcement system to book erring motorists will also be linked to Vahan. The ANPR camera will capture the registration particulars of all vehicles and cross-check it with the database and only black listed ones will be stopped.

An autorickshaw that was brought for fitness test in the captial was having the same number of a motorcycle in Cherthala. Further investigation showed that the motorcycle had been given the chassis number of another bike stolen in 2006 from Alappuzha. Blacklisted vehicles from other States will also be caught here. With the porting, the official said hundreds of blacklisted vehicles had been tracked and many were coming forward to clear pending penalties.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mvd-completes-porting-of-vehicles/article30719846.ece
220,2020/02/02,Govt. needs to tighten purse strings,"The State government will have to tighten its purse strings further and drastically slash expenditure to sustain welfare pensions and other initiatives in the wake of a cut in Central transfers and allocations from the divisible pool of taxes.

The State is already battling a grave resource crunch and the 15th Union Finance Commission’s proposal to maintain status quo in the allocation for the next financial year has rendered a rude jolt to the government.

The Centre’s indecision in clearing the Goods and Services Tax compensation arrears, the wages and administrative cost of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) amounting to about ₹1,250 crore and ₹1,050 crore for the paddy procurement scheme have compounded the financial woes of the government.

The cut in allocations for the job scheme and the alleged indecision in clearing the arrears would have serious implications in the State since it is the sole source of succour for 15 lakh families below the poverty line. About 95% of the 12.98 workers enrolled in the scheme are women and if the Centre refuses to clear the arrears and evolves a system for timely payment of wages in future, it would push them further to the brink of poverty and misery.

Paucity of funds would derail the paddy procurement scheme and deepen the crisis in the agrarian sector. The proposal to restrict the UFC award to about ₹17,000 crore has also gone against the State’s expectation to get an enhanced share of ₹20,000 crore.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac’s bid to mobilise the support of the Finance Ministers of non-BJP ruled States in prompting the Centre to raise the annual borrowing limit of States and timely release of GST compensation arrears seems to have been cold-shouldered by the Centre.

Kerala was not even give its due in the flood relief granted by the Centre. The dip in tax collections and drastic cut in Central transfers would put the State in dire straits. In the current context, the State government could ill-afford to shelve any of the welfare schemes, mainly the pensions citing paucity of funds.

The only option was to drastically cut the expenditure and go on a resource mopping drive by shoring up the tax collection to make up the deficit, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-needs-to-tighten-purse-strings/article30719786.ece

Speaking to mediapersons here after a review meeting on Saturday with the top brass of various Government departments on the progress of tribal development projects in the five northern districts of Wayanad, Kozhikode, Palakkad, Kannur and Malappuram, Mr. Jose said the meeting discussed issues related to tribespeople in the region and the recent Maoists sightings in the area.

Infrastructure facilities

Tribespeople had been facing several issues related to land rights, ration and Aadhaar cards, nutrition and the dearth of basic infrastructure in hamlets, said Mr. Jose, adding that officials concerned had been directed to solve the problems in a time-bound manner.

222,2020/02/02,‘Nadodigal 2’ movie review: V for ‘Velvom’,"Samuthirakani films are usually loud and make little sense. So, when you walk into a theatre playing Nadodigal 2 in Dolby Atmos, you know you’ve subscribed to a customised edition of Apple AirPods, pre-programmed with Samuthirakani’s woke politics that invades your mindspace even after crawling out of the theatre. Nadodigal 2 is not a movie, but a culmination of newsreels that has very little movie in it.

Jeeva (Sasikumar) is a firebrand activist who is consumed by his communist principles. For him, people’s welfare comes before anything. In short, he is a cardboard character who just exists mouthing painfully-boring dialogues that are woke and puke at the same time. He has his own A-Team consisting of Pandi (Barani), Sengodi (Anjali, in a refreshingly un-Samuthirakani character) and a senior communist member, who, admittedly, gets the best lines.

With his Poraali Army, Jeeva leads an anti-establishment protest, gathering youngsters — if you’re thinking of jallikattu protests, you are not alone. The Samuthirakani movie suddenly turns into a Pa Ranjith movie at the rally. Youngsters gather in large numbers. Rappers rock the stage with political songs. You expect sparks to fly, but it becomes a Sunburn Festival with Justin Prabhakaran’s thumping beats (I really liked the songs too, though there's a serious Dear Comrade hangover). It’s a terrific construct that is usually written for a climatic sequence. Whatever has been built so far gets collapsed like a human pyramid, when police forces disrupt the peaceful protest — if you’re thinking of Thoothukudi incident, you are not alone. Since it’s a Samuthirakani movie, the chaos doesn’t end there. When things go out of control, Jeeva screams “annan Ambedkar”, “maaveerar Bhagat Singh”, “karmaveerar Kamaraj”... you get the drift, right? Their vigour is reinstated and they form a human chain to defend themselves. Again, it’s a set-up that might want to become that gorgeous climax bit of Kaala, but it looks preposterous on screen.

Nadodigal 2 Cast: M Sasikumar, Anjali, Barani, Athulya Ravi and Sriranjani

M Sasikumar, Anjali, Barani, Athulya Ravi and Sriranjani Director: Samuthirakani

Samuthirakani Storyline: Set in Dindigul, a motley group of activists takes on casteism, honour killing, corporate and everything that is wrong in society

There has never been a more disjointed Samuthirakani movie in recent times. What Nadodigal 2 starts out to achieve and what it achieves in the end are two different tales. For example, a transgender character (who looks gorgeous), who is part of the Poraali gang, gets appointed as sub-inspector of police — if you reminded of a real-life incident, you are not alone. She gets a backstory of how miserably she was treated by her parents and the scene ends with her reuniting with them. Okay. Good intention. Very good message. But what relevance does it have on the overall design? However, I was glad that she wasn’t killed or raped — although she gets molested at the rally — making her the emotional core of the movie, like how Atlee would do.

But Nadodigal 2 isn’t just about transgender rights, gender politics, feminisim and Greta Thunberg... You cannot escape that easily, if it’s a Samuthirakani directorial. It bears no similarities with the 2009 movie (which was a far better outing that got its emotional beats right) but shares its emotional spirit. Here too, a couple elopes to get married with the blessings of Sasikumar. The movie wants to be anti-caste, establishing horrific details involved in honour killing — if you reminded...never mind. Note how the boy’s name and caste have been muted. Samuthirakani recreates the Sankar-Kousalya honour killing incident that happened in Tiruppur in 2016, with the least bit of sympathy or empathy with a Speed-styled climax. Making a anti-caste movie is one thing but milking a real-life incident to the point where blood shows up is another.

Some of the warm moments in Nadodigal 2 really worked for me. For instance, I liked the emotional dynamics between Jeeva and Sengodi. When was the last time we had a mainstream hero and heroine shared a relationship that’s typically not boyfriend-girlfriend or husband-wife? I knew Jeeva and Sengodi would fall in love eventually — heck, it’s Tamil cinema after all. But, for a brief while, it gave us a hope that they’re ‘thozhargal’ — maybe in another movie. Nadodigal 2 is replete with two-syllable words — velvom, jaipom, vazhvom and saavom. The word I'm looking for is hope. Or, in Samuthirakani’s parlance, nambuvom.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/vk46xa/article30718649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nadodigal-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nadodigal-2-starring-sasikumar-movie-review/article30718641.ece

224,2020/02/02,MSMEs have something to cheer about,"The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises across Tamil Nadu, who have been crying for attention for years, were happy with a slew of announcements in the Union Budget.

In her Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government had asked the Reserve Bank of India to extend debt restructuring window for MSMEs by a year to March 31, 2021. The restructuring window was to end on March 31, 2020. More than five lakh MSMEs benefited from restructuring of debt permitted by RBI in the last year.

K.V. Kanakambaram, president, Guindy Industrial Estate Manufacturers Association, called the Budget a historic for the MSME sector. “The proposal to extend restructuring by a year is a welcome move and this has been our long term request,” he said.

Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore president V. Lakshminarayanasamy, also said that the extension of time for restructuring of stressed loans for MSMEs will help. “The move to develop the electronic industry will hopefully bring opportunities to the domestic MSMEs,” he said.

R. Selvam, Thirumudivakkam Industrial Estate Manufacturer Association secretary, said the subordinate debt for MSME will support to improve the working capital inflow. “But we were expecting a repayment holiday from banks due to slow down,” he said.

S. Anburajan, president, Tamil Nadu Small and Tiny Industries Association, said that each announcement that was made by the Finance Minister would certainly boost the sector. He added that some of the expectations of MSMEs like increasing the NPA norms from 90 to 180 days, implementation of small factories Act, exemption upto ₹10 lakh for women entrepreneurs, exemption for Sarfaesi Act up to ₹2 crore for MSMEs were not considered.

MSMEs in Tamil Nadu unanimously lauded the announcement pertaining to raising the turnover threshold for audit of their accounts. At present, businesses with a turnover of more than ₹1 crore are required to get their books of accounts audited.

To make it easy for small retailers, traders, shopkeepers who comprise the MSME sector, the Finance Minister has proposed to raise threshold limit to ₹5 crore. However, this will apply to only those businesses which do less than 5% of their business transactions in cash.

Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (CODISSIA) president R. Ramamoorthy said if invoice financing was available from NBFCs, the subordinate debt announced by the Finance Minister will help ease credit needs of MSMEs. However, there is no direct effort to boost demand for these units. The Budget has addressed some of the concerns of the sector. “The MSME sector should have got the thrust that the agriculture sector received,” he said.

V. Krishnakumar, president, Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association, pointed out that the reduction in corporate tax will not benefit the MSMEs as most of the units are partnership or proprietorship firms.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/msmes-have-something-to-cheer-about/article30716933.ece
225,2020/02/02,Disability sector disappointed despite hike in allocation,"Despite an increase in allocation to the disability sector from ₹1,100 crore in 2019 to ₹1,325 crore this year, activists said the Budget was ‘disappointing’.

Sudha Ramamoorthy from the Equals Centre for Promotion of Social Justice said allocation for the Institute for Sign Language, Institute for Research on Technologies for Persons With Disabilities and the ADIP scheme has been reduced. “There is only a marginal increment in the allocation to the Rehabilitation Council of India (RCI), which is responsible for ensuring that qualified professionals work towards rehabilitation of persons with disabilities,"" she said. In a statement, the Equals Centre said no mention or provision has been made for enhancing services for the disabled in rural areas. The increment in allocation to the RCI would also mean that expansion of quality rehabilitation and rehabilitation services would not see the light of the day.

The National Platform for the Rights of the Disabled expressed its complete disenchantment with the Budget. “In the Caring India scheme that the Minister spoke about, the disabled do not figure at all. Omission of flagship programmes like the Accessible India campaign are glaring,” according to a statement.

Its national treasurer, S. Nambu Rajan, said the budget reflected a complete neglect of government services meant to aid the disabled. “It fails to even acknowledge the existence of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016 and continues to make provisions under the now repealed Act of 1995. We also expected an announcement about enhancing the disability pension from ₹300, which has, once again been ignored,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/disability-sector-disappointed-despite-hike-in-allocation/article30716906.ece

“The Avvai who sang Aathichoodi belonged to the 12th century,” he said.

He added: “When evidence is emerging increasingly that Indus Valley Civilization is Tamil civilization and that the alphabet found there are ancient Tamil alphabet as has been acknowledged by top scholars such as Asko Parpola and Iravatham Mahadevan, Ms. Sitharaman referring to IVC as ‘Saraswati’ IVC is an attempt to associate it with the Vedic period by connecting it to the imaginary Saraswati river mentioned in the Vedas.

227,2020/02/02,Chennai- Bengaluru Expressway work to be speeded up,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman on Saturday announced that work on the Chennai-Bengaluru Expressway will be started.

Official sources in the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) said that land acquisition for the 262-km- long six-lane expressway was in an advanced stage.

“Already disbursal of funds had been completed as payment towards land for the road that runs through Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

The cost of the project would be ₹6,000 crore. “Now that the government has decided to fast-track the project, the award of compensation for property owners will be completed within three months. The road will take three years,” the official added.

The access-controlled road will reduce travel time between Bengaluru and Chennai. At present, it takes six hours.

The new road would allow vehicles to travel in four hours. It would prevent accidents since there would not be any junctions allowing vehicles or pedestrians to cross.

229,2020/02/02,"No incentive for home buyers, say developers","The real estate sector termed the Union Budget mostly disappointing, with a few welcome aspects.

CREDAI Tamil Nadu chairman S. Sridharan said while a few aspects were welcome, the proposals with regard to affordable housing and input tax credit were disappointing.

“We welcome the extension of allowance of ₹1.5 lakh for affordable housing for the developers as well as home buyers by one year to 2021. Tax holiday has also been extended by one year. Capital gain limit has been increased from 5% to 10%, to minimise hardship,” said Mr. Sridharan.

But the real estate sector has expressed disappointment at various aspects of the Budget. “We wanted affordable housing pegged at ₹75 lakh. Now it is pegged at ₹45 lakh. What is luxury in Chennai may be affordable in Mumbai. We want input tax credit to come back. It is causing hardship,” he said.

CREDAI Chennai president W.S. Habib said the Budget was very disappointing. “We expected a lot of relief to this ailing industry which contributes to 6-8% of GDP. The new optional scheme for income tax is very bad for the sector as there is no motivation for tax payers to avail themselves of home loan and buy property,” he said.

Suresh Krishn, past president of CREDAI Chennai, said it was the most disappointing Budget for real estate sector. “We were expecting some kind of incentive to promote real estate sector. But it has been disappointing. There is nothing to incentivise the home buyers in this Budget. Earlier, people used to buy home to save tax. That too has gone.”

Satish Magar, president, CREDAI National, said sector specific measures were not announced for real estate. “We expected bolder steps to provide liquidity for the sector, one-time restructuring of loans, and tax deductions on home loans to give impetus to buyer sentiment. The only way in which this Budget can boost real estate sector is by accelerating growth to 6.5% in 2020-21 from 5% at present,” he said.

Anshuman Magazine, Chairman & CEO - India, South East Asia, Middle East & Africa, CBRE, said the Budget was progressive, touching upon every section of the economy. “The allocation of ₹100 lakh crore for infrastructure development in the next five years is a move in the positive direction. Increased focus on projects including housing, safe drinking water, clean energy, health, modern railway, airport, metro bus will lead to increased benefits for the real estate sector,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jbvpcy/article30718180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THREALESTATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-incentive-for-home-buyers-say-developers/article30716896.ece

Alagiri on Saturday said national parties and others who fought for the country’s freedom should unite against the BJP which, he said, was trying to dilute the Constitution.

Addressing a meeting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register, Mr. Alagiri said,

“Bharatiya Janata Party is a party which was formed out of an organisation which had no role in the Indian freedom struggle. Today, they are trying to wreck the Constitution. The Constitution says that anyone who was born and are living in India are Indians. But the BJP is trying to amend it, and CAA, NPR and NRC are attempts in that direction.”

I-T searches

Regarding the recent Income Tax searches at actor Vijay’s residence, Mr. Alagiri said the tax sleuths had different yardsticks for Vijay and fellow film star Rajinikanth.

Mr. Alagiri said Mr. Vijay had requested the tax officers to carry out the searches another day, but the tax sleuths treated him like a detainee and conducted the searches. But in a case involving Mr. Rajinikanth, the I-T officials informed the court that they would not file an appeal in higher courts if the actor paid a penalty of ₹66 lakh. “Rajinikanth recently said that CAA was not against Muslims. He had read out a statement issued by the BJP, and maybe that’s why he was granted that concession,” Mr. Alagiri alleged.

After the Budget-viewing session organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), its chairman for southern region Sanjay Jayavarthanavelu said the Budget had addressed different sectors of economy with focus on technology, skill development, rural development, agriculture, blue industry and MSMEs.

S. Chandramohan, Chairman, CII Tamil Nadu State Council, said the scheme of solar grid connected power set in barren land for farmers and the support given for horticulture in the Budget through “one district one product” announcement was welcome.

M. Ponnuswami, CMD, Pon Pure Chemicals Ltd, termed the announcements for MSME sector as timely.

Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, president, Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said in the context of structural changes in business driven by technology and global employment opportunities, the opening up of education to foreign direct investment and external commercial borrowing should provide significant impetus to developing human capital. “With 270 million people in the age group of 20 to 29, India has an obligation to educate and skill its youth for global opportunities unleashed by emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, data science and IoT,” he said.

Ravichandran Purushothaman, president, Danfoss India, said, “The Budget restores our confidence in agriculture and allied industries to increase their contribution to GDP in coming days.” “With the expansion of NABARD refinance scheme and extension of agri-credit to ₹15 lakh crore, there definitely is a greater scope to address the industry’s challenges at the grassroots level. The ability of States to fuel infrastructure support in tandem with the push for increased cold chain infrastructure for agriculture, horticulture, dairy and fisheries will be key to tackling the food loss in our country,” he said.

Long-term goals

Kesavan, co-chair, FICCI, Tamil Nadu, said the Budget needs to be looked into as a long-term aspect. Usually, people expect a short-term Budget expecting an immediate result. “However this isn’t the case with this Budget since it will go on for 3 or 4 years.”

R. Ganapathi, president of SICCI, summed up the budget by saying that it has all the necessary ingredients to trigger economic growth, rural development and initiate schemes to increase disposable income to stimulate the demand.

P.G. Sadguru Das, president, Hindustan Chamber of Commerce, said the Budget aims at an aspirational India. “Removal of dividend distribution tax is welcome. Shifting the same to stakeholders keeping in mind only the foreign investors is not so welcome. Hope they do not bring a TDS on this, which only earlier made it a cumbersome process to claim refunds,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/industry-welcomes-budget/article30716938.ece

Since morning, my wife S. Vigneshwari and I have been glued to the TV in our 325 sq. ft. house at the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) tenement in Tondiarpet. We were hoping for some announcement that would bring cheer to people like us who belong to the low-income group.

Lowering the price of essential goods, increasing subsidy for purchasing a house etc. would have made us happy.

The announcements pertaining to tax does not affect us as we fall below the ₹5 lakh slab.

233,2020/02/02,A corporate-friendly exercise: Opposition,"Major political parties in Tamil Nadu described the Union Budget as “corporate-friendly” while the alliance partners of the BJP-AIADMK combine welcomed it.

DMK president M.K. Stalin said the Budget had recorded its concern for the corporate sector and there was hardly any scheme to improve the income of farmers and creation of employment while retaining the existing jobs. He said although Tamil Nadu was one of the most urbanised State, the Budget had not allocated fund for creation of infrastructure and railway projects.

Mr. Stalin said the BJP government, which was keen on propagating the Hindutva ideology, had renamed Indus Valley Civilization as Saraswathi Sindhu Civilization. “Privatisation of district hospitals and LIC is clear proof that the government lacks foresight,” he said.

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said the announcement to privatise railways was an indication that the BJP government has decided to destroy the public sector institutions. “The move will benefit only the corporate houses,” he alleged and condemned the divestment of the LIC which was founded by Jawaharlal Nehru. Mr. Alagiri said the addition of the word Saraswathi with the Indus Valley Civilization was actually an expression of the Hindutva ideology. “There are no announcements to benefit Tamil Nadu. Although Chennai-Bengaluru expressway has been announced, there is no mention about allocation of funds,” he said.

CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan said the Budget had disappointed the people as it had not included their expectations. “It will benefit the corporate houses while creating further financial crisis,” he said. Mr. Balakrishnan took exception to the use of word Sarawathi to refer to the Indus Valley Civilization.

MDMK general secretary Vaiko said foreign direct investment in education would only commercialise the higher education and research. He alleged that privatisation of railway would severely affect the public service and increase in the passenger and freight fare. “Privatisation of the country’s biggest insurance agency LIC will severely affect the people,” he said. Apart from changes in the individual tax structure and creation of a museum in Adhichanallur, there were no welcome announcements.

PMK, TMC welcome proposals

PMK leader S. Ramadoss welcomed the Budget saying that the 16-point programme for development of agriculture and the reduction in the income-tax would benefit the people and pave the way for growth. But he expressed his disappointment over reduction of fund for rural development and panchayat raj from ₹1.40 lakh crore to ₹1.23 lakh crore.

“Allocation of funds for Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment as per requirement would create employment opportunities in rural areas,” Dr. Ramadoss said and welcomed the increase of fund for education and health.

234,2020/02/02,Centre for linking medical colleges to dist. hospitals,"A plan evolved by NITI Aayog found its way into the Union Budget on Saturday — to attach a medical college to an existing district hospital in public private partnership (PPP) mode to address the shortage of doctors.

Even as NITI Aayog’s proposal set off discussions on whether it would lead to privatisation of government district hospitals, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, responding to a question recently, ruled out privatisation of district hospitals in Tamil Nadu as the State’s rural health care was good.

But on Saturday, in the Budget speech, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that States that fully allowed medical colleges to use the facilities of hospitals and wished to provide land at a concession would receive viability gap funding, details of which will be worked out.

Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, commenting on NITI Aayog’s scheme then, called the proposal violative of the spirit of universal health care and said it went against the government’s own National Health Policy of 2017. It said NITI Aayog lacked understanding that the district hospital is the apex of primary health care approach and not a surrogate of the medical college.

One of the problematic clauses in the model agreement is that the patients shall be categorised into “free patients” and others.

J. Amalorpavanathan, retired professor of vascular surgery, Madras Medical College, said that handing over a well-run district hospital to a private entity is a recipe for disaster.

“Medical education should be in the hands of the State government. Similarly, medical care too. Such a proposal is certainly not a good idea, especially in a State like Tamil Nadu, he said.

Tamil Nadu had been “over-producing” MBBS doctors, he said and added: “The need for doctors and specialists should be rationally and periodically evaluated, and production of doctors and specialists should be dynamic and in response to the assessed needs.”

P. Kuganantham, chairman, Indian Public Health Foundation, while welcoming the idea, said it should not end up with privatisation of the hospital. “A perfect Memorandum of Understanding should be entered between the private and public sector. The private college should be assigned to improve the infrastructure of the district hospital, maintenance of basic facilities, care of poor patients requiring advanced treatment and reduce the fee for the students,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/9plxng/article30716909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/centre-for-linking-medical-colleges-to-dist-hospitals/article30716910.ece
235,2020/02/02,"Adichanallur site gets its due, finally","The Finance Minister’s announcement that an onsite museum at Adichanallur to highlight the archaeological findings belonging to a civilised society that lived close to the Tamirabarani waterway between 905 BCE and 696 BCE has triggered euphoria here. People interested in resurrecting the facts about the civilisation feel that the Centre has finally understood the importance of the excavations.

Although excavations began at this site during colonial rule — between 1902 and 1903 — not much was done subsequently to tell the world about the Adichanallur civilisation. Even though burial urns with Tamil Brahmi script, coins, stone weapons, terracotta products, bangles and other utensils used by this ancient civilisation that lived in properly-formed streets were found accidentally at this site, excavation was not taken up by government agencies.

Report under wraps

After repeated appeals, an excavation was done in 2004 and 169 clay burial urns with skeletons were recovered in 2005, but the report was not made public for reasons best known to the Archaeological Survey of India. The artefacts collected from the spot were not sent for carbon data analysis and came in for sharp criticism by the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court later.

When the Centre’s eerie silence continued, writer Muthaalankurichi Kamarasu filed a case seeking direction to the Centre for tabling the report besides resuming excavation at the site. Moreover, the burial urns retrieved from Puliyankulam area should be showcased properly by setting up a museum, he had pleaded.

Mr. Kamarasu had prayed that proper survey and excavation should be done at nearby Sivakalai and in 37 places along the Tamirabarani watercourse.

On its part, the Manonmaniam Sundaranar University (MSU) had planned to play an active role in the archaeological exploration to be carried out at Aadhichanallur, Sivakalai and Authoor. The university, by using non-invasive strategies like deploying drones and geotechnology gadgets along with its faculty members from geotechnology, biotechnology, Tamil and history departments in these places for the exploration activities to unearth the ancient history and culture buried under.

“Since we are sitting pretty close to these archaeological hotspots, we are planning to start postgraduate and research programmes in archaeology besides creating a ‘Heritage Centre and Museum’ on the main campus at Abhishekapatti to showcase our 3,000-year-old history and culture to the younger generation,” says K. Pitchumani, Vice-Chancellor, MSU.

S. Sudhakar of the department of biotechnology at MSU, who makes frequent visits to the archaeological sites of Adichanallur, Sivakalai and Korkai, said it was a great moment. “The Centre’s decision to establish the museum at Adichanallur will go a long way in proceeding with the excavation at this ancient civilisation site,” he said.

Meanwhile, the State government, after getting the Union government’s nod, had commenced survey on 114 acres at Adichanallur by a 10-member team from Friday (January 31) onwards. To begin with, the team had chosen an area measuring about 500 metres into 500 metres where the excavation was likely to be done. With the help of a radar mounted on a drone, the team, after clearing the thorny bushes on this site, surveyed the area for possible metals lying under the surface. Similar survey was being done at Sivakalai.

“Even as the survey had begun for excavation, the Centre has decided to set up a museum at Adichanallur at least now, which would tell the world about the ancientness of Tamils and their civilisation. The carbon dating conducted on the products recovered from this site in Florida labs had proved that it was at least 2,900-year-old civilization. If the excavations are done properly, the world will be surprised to see how advanced ancient Tamils’ life was,” says Mr. Kamarasu.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/12hayl/article30716871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02ONSITE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/adichanallur-site-gets-its-due-finally/article30716873.ece
236,2020/02/02,CM wants iconic status for Keeladi too,"Welcoming the Union Budget, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has said several announcements and proposals have not only met expectations of people but have also been prepared with vision.

Thanking the Centre for its decision to develop Adichanallur as an “iconic site with an onsite museum”, the Chief Minister, in a statement, wanted the Centre to include Keeladi too under the proposed project.

On the proposal for “comprehensive measures” for 100 “water-stressed districts”, he said that all such districts in the State should be included with the provision of more funds. The Centre should choose Tamil Nadu for establishing a national police university or a national forensic science university, he added.

Through the National Technical Textiles Mission to be implemented over the next four years with an outlay of ₹1,480 crore, the textile companies in Chennai, Tiruppur and Virudhunagar could be upgraded to international standards. Tamil Nadu should be chosen under the new scheme of “smart cities”, he said.

Referring to the move to build 100 airports to support Udan, the CM wanted allocation of adequate funds not only for the development of airports in Neyveli, Hosur and Rameswaram but also for the expansion of Coimbatore, Tiruchi, Madurai and Thoothukudi airports.

Welcoming the provisions in the Budget to develop specific sectors, the CII chairman said such steps would help the manufacturing sector. The proposed national logistics policy and the boost to electricity generation, by extending 15% tax option, would be an added advantage to the manufacturing sector, he added.

On the initiatives to promote startups, Mr. Kalaiichelvan said tax incentives announced for the sector would help in creating more jobs.

“It is very encouraging to see that the government has perceived the startup sector as a key job creator, as well as an engine of growth. After successive reforms in previous budgets for startups, the budget has further introduced reforms in the form of tax deferment of ESOPs for five years and 100% tax relief for startups with up to ₹100 crore turnover,” the statement said.

245,2020/02/02,Internal bickering comes to the fore in BJP Karimnagar unit,"Internal bickering among the BJP district unit leaders came to the fore at the party preparatory meeting for the ensuing cooperative societies elections, here on Saturday.

BJP district president Basa Satyanarayana Rao had convened a meeting with the party leaders including former legislators Suddala Devaiah and Bodiga Shoba, BJP leader K Odelu and others at Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar’s camp office in the town.

However, the district leadership failed to inform the senior leaders belonging to BJP, BJP Dalit Morcha, BJP Yuva Morcha and others. Irked at not inviting them for the meeting, BJYM State secretary P Sai Krishna Reddy, BJP district secretaries Gujja Satish and Nageshwar Reddy, BJP Dalit Morcha State secretary Durgam Maruthi, VHP leader Radhakrishna Reddy and others arrived at the meeting venue and grilled the district party president for not inviting them.

They asked why the party did not conduct similar preparatory meeting for the MCK polls to gear up the candidates for the elections. Alleging that the party’s district leadership was responsible for the poor performance in the MCK polls, they charged that the tickets were sold, neglecting the dedicated party workers in the municipal elections.

Flaying the district BJP leadership for winning only 13 divisions in MCK polls against a total of 60 divisions, they found fault with the party for fielding candidates from only 50 divisions and neglecting the winning candidates. They asked why the BJP candidates could not win at least a single municipal ward or division in entire Karimnagar district.

When there were heated arguments, Mr. Suddala Devaiah said that the party leadership should have invited all the leaders for the meeting.

246,2020/02/02,Exploring Medaram from the skies,"Pilgrimage to the historic Sammakka Sarakka Jatara at Medaram village has undergone a sea change over the decades, particularly in recent times.

The improved road network, publicity and increased faith among the people has resulted in the tribal festival assuming mammoth proportions.

Until almost 22 years ago, the only way devotees could reach Medaram to take part in the biennial jatara was through a bullock cart. In 1998, the government declared the 1,000-year-old festival as a State festival and laid a road with supporting infrastructure while making arrangements for drinking water, electricity, accommodation, parking and, most importantly, security.

Transport options

Slowly but steadily, the number of devotees visiting the jatara site increased and so did the routes. Thousands of people from nearby villages used to walk through thick forests for days on end to reach Medaram. Devotees from other areas like Khammam and Bhadrachalam, and even neighbouring States of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh used to cross river Godavari to worship the tribal deities. However, the number of people who walk or take bullock carts to Medaram has reduced considerably. Today, devotees have various options of transport, starting from the traditional bullock cart to buses, private vehicles and even helicopters.

Helicopter rides to Medaram began in 2010 from the Mamnoor airport in Warangal. Turbo Aviation Company arranged a helicopter and charged ₹6,000 for a round trip. However, the service did not take off successfully and was eventually called off. Officials tried to revive it in 2014 and 2016 as well but were not successful. The Tourism Department started providing the service in 2018.

Two packages

This year, the Telangana State Tourism Development Corporation in collaboration with Telangana State Aviation Corporation launched the helicopter service from Hyderabad. Flagged off by Tourism Minister on Sunday, it offers two packages to tourists. The first one allows six persons to take the ride at a total cost of ₹1.80 lakh, exclusive of GST. The package includes helicopter charges, a shuttle vehicle from the helipad to the temple and VIP darshan. Another package costing ₹3,000 per person takes one on an aerial tour of Medaram area.

Speaking on the occasion, the Adivasi leaders said the foot march is aimed at mounting pressure on the government to initiate concrete action to protect the rights of indigenous people and preserve the distinctive Adivasi cultural heritage.

They demanded that a special column be introduced for enumerating the population of Adivasis spread across the country in the census-2021 to create a reliable demographic data for effectively implementing welfare schemes in proportionate to the exact population of indigenous people.

The other main demands of the Adivasi organisations include protecting vast tracts of forest lands inhabited by Adivasis and averting the alleged impending submergence of the low-lying areas in the temple town of Bhadrachalam from the threat of backwaters of the upcoming Polavaram project in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, removal of the plain area tribes from the list of STs, protection of rights of Adivasis enshrined in the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ra4r8k/article30721206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03BHADRACHALAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/adivasis-embark-on-130-km-padayatra-to-medaram/article30721207.ece
248,2020/02/02,"New IT regime may dent popularity of life, health covers","A new, simplified personal income tax (I-T) regime announced in Union Budget 2020-21 under which relatively lower rates will be applicable for taxpayers foregoing a host of deductions and exemptions is bound to impact popularity of life and health insurance policies.

Individuals opting for the new tax regime would be foregoing tax exemptions and “may end up spending money than use it towards their financial safety and security,” said managing director and CEO of Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Tarun Chugh.

For long such policies, particularly life covers, are preferred as well as solicited on the strength of the accompanying tax breaks on the premium paid. All that is also likely to change with the new I-T regime. Sources among insurance intermediaries say no tax sops on the premium paid is bound to not only hit life insurance premium mobilisation, but also may lead to surrender of policies.

Almost all deductions available under Chapter VIA of the Income Tax Act, including Section 80C, 80CCC, 80CCD and 80D, will have to be given up as a prerequisite by those opting for the new I-T regime. Life insurers as much as their customers are likely to adopt a wait-and-watch approach.

Culture of savings

Deductions for the premium paid under Section 80C are believed to have inculcated in households a culture of consistent long-term savings. “We need to wait and observe what proportion of taxpayers opt for existing rates and how many opt for the proposed (new tax) rates and what effect it has on the savings culture of households,” said managing director of Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance Company G. Murlidhar.

Aditya Birla Sun Life Insurance CEO Kamlesh Rao said the insurance industry will be watchful of the implication of the direct tax changes in the new tax regime.

Noting that risk management through insurance is an essential part of nation building, IndiaFirst Life Insurance managing director and CEO R. M. Vishakha said in India, the construct has always nudged future savings and risk management through encouraging conscious investment towards the same aided by tax relief.

Other deductions

Besides those on insurance premium paid, the new IT regime requires taxpayers to forego several other deductions, including contributions made to charitable institutions under Section 80G; expenses on rehabilitation of handicapped dependent (80DD); medical expenditure on self or dependent relative (80DDB); interest on education loan (80E); and interest on home loan (80EE).

“Our initial analysis suggests it is beneficial for taxpayers to continue investment in life insurance policies for claiming tax exemption under Section 80C of I-T Act as it would be beneficial with less tax outflow in the year in which premiums are paid,” said managing director and CEO of Max Life Insurance Prashant Tripathy.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/new-it-regime-may-dent-popularity-of-life-health-covers/article30720973.ece
249,2020/02/02,"Screening of passengers from Singapore, Thailand, begins at RGIA","Screening of passengers arriving on flights from Singapore, Thailand to reach Hyderabad has started at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad, from Saturday midnight. Singapore has reported 18 confirmed cases of Novel Coronavirus (nCoV). Till two-days ago, the screening of passengers using thermal scanners and thermal guns was limited to passengers coming in flights from China and Hong Kong.

If anyone is detected with high temperature, they are asked about their travel history, symptoms, to know if they might have nCoV.

The screening is extended to passengers coming from two more countries after Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare gave directions to this effect on Saturday. Apart from the screening, officials said that they are handing out Self-Declaration forms to the passengers where travel history to China, symptoms, address and other symptoms are asked for.

“Announcements are made on-board, in airports, to contact health authorities if anyone has the travel history and symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath and cold, among others,” said a senior Health official.

Evacuated from Wuhan

There are at least five people from Telangana among those who were evacuated from Wuhan, China, in the past two-days. Telangana Health Department officials said that they received the information but did not receive any official confirmation on it yet.

Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender who held a tele-conference with officials in State Health Department on Sunday has directed them to keep Pulmonologists ready if there were to be any requirement.

Apart from the Isolation Wards at Fever Hospital, Gandhi Hospital, Government General and Chest Hospital, arrangements will be made at other government teaching hospitals across the State to admit nCoV suspects.

Officials said that they have mapped where would they draw doctors and staff if number of suspected nCoV cases were to increase.

1 more suspect

A person who has returned from China and has some symptoms was admitted in Isolation Ward of Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases (Fever Hospital), Nallakunta, on Sunday. His samples too were collected which will be sent to test for nCoV.

However, no one from the State tested positive for the virus till date. Officials are still awaiting for results of seven more samples collected from patients admitted at State government hospitals. The tests for nCoV might be initiated at Gandhi Hospital’s laboratory from Monday.

A total of 30 samples can be tested in one-cycle at the lab. And each cycle takes eight to ten-hours to know the results. Time taken to send the samples to National Institute of Virology (NIV)-Pune, will be saved after the tests are initiated at Gandhi Hospital.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/screening-of-passengers-from-singapore-thailand-begins-at-rgia/article30720829.ece

251,2020/02/02,Thick blanket of security thrown across Medaram,"About 10,000 police personnel from across the State have been drafted as part of security arrangements at the historic Sammakka Sarakka Jatara at Medaram village beginning on February 5, said Superintendent of Police S.S.G. Patil.

The force includes three police commissioners (Warangal, Ramagundam and Khammam) and six SPs, 30 ASPs, 80 DSPs, 300 circle inspectors and 750 sub-inspectors who would keep vigil at the jatara that has been divided into 20 sectors.

They will be under direct supervision of IG Y. Nagi Reddy and other senior officers. The jatara area is spread over nearly 7 sqkm that includes various villages around Medaram and also the route from Warangal to Medaram via Mulugu and back via Bhupalpally.

CCTV surveillance

“We have installed 400 CCTV cameras at key points, including the altar and the bathing ghats. They are all connected to the command and control room at ITDA camp office where officers will be monitoring screens round-the-clock. A total of 100 two-wheelers are deployed so that policemen can patrol through the crowd to clear traffic and ensure law and order,” Mr. Patil explained.

Special officers will be deployed for crowd management at the altars and to monitor traffic movement. One-way vehicular movement has been designed to avoid traffic jams on the routes leading to Medaram. Devotees coming from Warangal will reach Medaram via Pasra and Narlapur. They will take the route towards Bhupalpally while returning and leave via Parkal. VVIPs and RTC buses will take the route via Tadvai to reach as well as to return. Devotees have been urged to park vehicles only in the designated parking locations.

Mr Patil said their aim is to ensure an incident-free jatara and therefore, they have set up a police camp every 4 km enroute to the site.

Fire safety

Besides, the Fire Department has also deployed its personnel at Medaram. Divisional Fire Officer M. Bhagavan Reddy said 11 fire engines will be pushed into service while nine Mist Bullets (fire extinguishers on two wheelers) will be kept ready to put out minor fires. He said fire engines were deployed at Chilukalagutta, the altar, Jampanna Vagu, RTC bus station, helipad, Narlapur, Chintal cross and at Tadvai.

District Collector R.V. Karnan said the arrangements are more elaborate as compared to last jatara. “My only request is that those driving vehicles should not cause traffic snarls. They should stop for a while until the line is clear. I also request devotees not to carry any plastic bags,” he appealed.

Mr. Karnan added that 38 parking places were set up on 1,500 acres and there were four routes to reach Medaram from all over the State and neighbouring Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/uyb149/article30720077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03MEDARAM1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/thick-blanket-of-security-thrown-across-medaram/article30720078.ece
252,2020/02/02,"24x7 water supply, sanitation my priorities: MCK Mayor","Yadagiri Sunil Rao, who has just been elected unanimously as the third Mayor of the Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar (MCK), said that his priority would be to ensure 24x7 water supply to the people of the town and proper sanitation to avoid spread of diseases, among others. In a free-wheeling chat with The Hindu, he spoke on various issues. Excerpts:

Q: What are your priorities as the third Mayor of Karimnagar town?

A. Karimnagar town has umpteen resources, which we need to tap properly. It is the only town in the State and even in the country to have a major irrigation project — Lower Manair Dam (LMD) reservoir. The Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) has come as a boon for the town with water availability throughout the year.

Hence, the TRS has decided to provide daily water supply to the people within three to four months for about 45 minutes or one hour to every household. After its successful implementation, we will launch the 24x7 water supply after about six to seven months.

Q: How do you plan to tackle the mosquito menace and spread of diseases such as dengue?

A: We will see to it that drains are constructed in such a way that water flows properly and mosquitoes don’t breed. We will also take up frequent fogging in colonies by purchasing additional vehicle-mounted fogging machines, and ensure fogging in each locality at least once a week.

Q: What about the Smart City Project and delay in taking up works?

A: The credit for sanctioning the Smart City Project goes to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, then Karimnagar MP and present TS Planning Board vice-chairman B. Vinod Kumar, Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar and the last body of the MCK. There is lot of money through the project and we have to provide better amenities to people. In fact, the pace of works has increased.

Q: Is not traffic congestion in town due to encroachment of footpaths by roadside vendors and others a big issue?

A: We want to ensure that footpaths are used only by pedestrians. We will erect grills along roads so that footpaths are not encroached. We will relocate roadside vendors to the newly- constructed vending zones.

Q: Will you continue the ‘ambitious’ Re 1 funeral scheme for all sections of the society?

A: We will continue all the welfare schemes launched by the last general body. We will implement the Re 1 funeral more effectively by allocating funds well in advance to the executing agency.

Q: How do you solve complaints about poor sanitation and cleaning of roads and drains in colonies?

A. The existing sanitation staff is inadequate. We will recruit more at the rate of 28 members for every 10,000 population to ensure cleanliness. Further, we plan to close all open drains with pipes and avoid spread of mosquito-borne diseases.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/osb2lq/article30724281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-MCK-MAYOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/24x7-water-supply-sanitation-my-priorities-mck-mayor/article30719707.ece
253,2020/02/02,Torchbearer of early Telangana movement and ex-MP Narayana Reddy passes away in Nizamabad,"Former MP, senior advocate, and one of the protagonists of the separate Telangana movement in 1969, M. Narayana Reddy passed away after a brief illness at a private hospital here on Sunday.

Minister for Endowments, Law and Forest A. Indrakaran Reddy, who happens to be his close relative, and former Assembly Speaker K. R. Suresh Reddy were his bedside when Mr. Narayana Reddy breathed his last in the morning around 11.30.

Born in September 10, 1931 at Sunket village in Morthad mandal, the veteran lawyer was a freedom fighter, educationist, doyen of women’s education in north Telangana. He established the first Women's College in 22 acres in the heart of the town here in 1965. The college subsequently grew in size and numbers producing many academics, researchers, and bureaucrats who had achieved good positions. He also set up a high school to provide good education to the poor and middle class students.

Many lawyers who worked under him as juniors became successful in their careers. Mr. Narayana Reddy served as an MP in 1969 and MLA from Bodhan.

First to raise separate Telangana in Lok Sabha

As an MP he raised the issue of a separate Telangana for the first time in Lok Sabha. He had the rare distinction of speaking on the issue for 80 minutes and the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who was in the House listened to his speech laced with satires and jibes with a rapt attention.

Survived by wife Padmavathi, son Arun Reddy and three daughters, Mr. Narayana Reddy lived as a Gandhiyan throughout his life. He liberally donated in kind and cash to several schools and educational institutions.

Reception turns into condolence meeting

On Sunday, he was to attend a civic reception arranged by his admirers, disciples and managements of the educational institutions which he had floated. Ironically, when everyone was waiting for his arrival, news came in of his passing away. And, what was meant to be a felicitation ceremony turnned into a condolence meeting.

Amruthalatha, and several others paid homage to Mr. Narayana Reddy.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pfljlf/article30719259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/REDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/torchbearer-of-early-telangana-movemement-and-ex-mp-narayana-reddy-passes-away/article30719244.ece
254,2020/02/02,Educational intervention heralds a new era of girls’ empowerment in Rajasthan,"Modestly attired Rukmina of Bidarka village is the proud recipient of an award given by the Kishangarh Bas Sub-Divisional Officer on this year’s Republic Day in recognition of her contribution to women’s empowerment by generating awareness about digital services. She studies for a bachelor’s degree and runs an e-governance centre in the nondescript village.

Rukmina, 21, is among the 78 girls from about a dozen villages of Alwar district’s Kishangarh Bas block, forming part of the Mewat region, who have completed their schooling and are going for higher and technical education. A prolonged educational intervention has created this “first batch” of girls in the region which had an abysmal 10% female literacy rate till a decade ago.

Daughter of labourer

Daughter of a landless labourer who worked hard to become the in-charge of employment guarantee works, Rukmina is looked upon as an entrepreneur whose e-Mitra centre provides online facilities to the villagers. “I also use this place as a platform for schoolgirls and give them guidance for studies... As Bidarka’s first girl to pass out XII, it is very satisfying,” Rukmina told The Hindu.

While Rukmina is pursuing the bachelor's course from an open university, three girls from her village have joined Kishangarh P.G. College at the block headquarters and one — Sakunat, daughter of Sarpanch Jamshed Khan — has shifted to Bharatpur to study in the Agriculture College. Since Bidarka has only a government middle school, several girls are staying in hostels in Kishangarh Bas to study till XII.

Shabnam Bano, 23, from the nearby Mirzapur village is the first girl from the block to complete a polytechnic diploma course and join an engineering college. “Though I convinced my parents, I could join the polytechnic college in Alwar after facing strong opposition by villagers who thought that education polluted girls’ minds,” said Shabnam, pursuing B.Tech. in Alwar’s Laxmi Devi Institute of Engineering & Technology.

The educational intervention, which has heralded a new era of empowerment of adolescent girls belonging to the backward Meo Muslim community in the region, was made by the Alwar Mewat Institute of Education and Development (AMIED) through the “Initiative for Better Tomorrow” project in 2016. It was aimed at stopping child marriages by promoting adolescent girls’ education.

AMIED volunteered to conduct bridge courses and run residential and remedial classes for girls to enable them to complete their senior secondary education. The parents were convinced and the local communities in 25 villages were mobilised to send girls to the government-run hostels from villages where only poorly equipped primary and middle schools were functioning.

“The results are very encouraging. A new generation of educated and confident girls has emerged in this region, where people believed till a few years ago that the girls were only meant to do household chores and lend a hand in the fields during sowing and harvest season,” AMIED member-secretary Noor Mohammed said. Girls in the region were earlier married at the age of 12 to 14.

E-Mitra centres

AMIED project coordinator Asha Narang said 10 girls and women had started their e-Mitra centres with the support of Digital Empowerment Foundation and a mobile phone manufacturer. These centres, run with solar power, are also utilised for counselling on reproductive health and digital education as well as for motivating girls and their families for education.

The impact is visible in the villages such as Jilota, Medabas, Musakheda, Ismailpur, Ghansoli, Chorbasai and Kolgaon. From Bagora village, half-a-dozen girls travel as a group to Kishangarh Bas every day to attend college. Nahida, a Bachelor of Arts student, said marriage was nowhere on priority for the girls until they completed their education.

The project, funded by the American Jewish World Service, has also led to the establishment of groups called Mewat Balika Manch, which fine-tune girls’ skills and provide subject-specific support for board examinations. Besides, people’s conventions and workshops with religious leaders were organised to discuss the ways to stop the dropout of girls from schools.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jiwdh2/article30721237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE02-RAJASTHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/educational-intervention-heralds-a-new-era-of-girls-empowerment-in-rajasthan/article30721238.ece
255,2020/02/02,8-year-old girl raped by driver,"A 26-year-old man was arrested for allegedly raping an eight-year-old girl in Barabanki district of Uttar Pradesh, police said on Sunday.

The accused was the driver of a relative of the girl’s family. She has been admitted to the district hospital in a serious condition, they said.

“On Saturday evening, a relative of the minor girl had come to meet her family. The girl was playing behind her house when she was raped by the driver, who was in an inebriated state,” Superintendent of Police Arvind Chaturvedi said.

“The girl raised an alarm, and her family members saw that she was bleeding,” he said.

“The accused tried to flee from the spot, but was caught and thrashed by the villagers,” he added.

He was arrested and a case registered against him under the IPC and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, the officer said.

256,2020/02/02,Farmers threaten stir if procurement policy is changed,"As the debate surrounding the review of open-ended procurement policy has started gaining momentum, following a recommendation by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Price (CACP) to the Centre government, several farmers and farmers’ bodies in Punjab and Haryana have hinted that any move to stop or limit it would be opposed and resisted.

Agri-experts also believe that the current open-ended procurement policy is in the best interest of the country and farmers and any deviation could have negative impact on farmers.

‘Mounting stocks’

“The CACP has given its recommendation in the backdrop of mounting food stocks, which raises the fear that the Centre would limit procurement as a first step towards putting an end to the MSP purchase,” said Jagmohan Singh, State General Secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union Ekta (Dakaunda).

“Any move to stop or limit the purchase of wheat and rice at MSP by the government would be opposed and resisted in the strongest possible manner,” he said.

Expressing similar sentiments Sarvan Singh Pandher, general secretary of the Punjab unit of Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Smiti, said “farmers in Punjab and Haryana are managing to survive only because wheat and paddy here are purchased at the MSP, if this process is stopped or even limited it would be nothing short of signing their death warrant.”

“Government should be ready to face agitation if the open ended procurement policy is changed in a manner, which is detrimental to farmers interest,” Mr. Pandher said.

Pargat Singh, who has sown wheat in nearly 14 acres at Rolu Majra village in district Rupnagar, said a reason cited by the CACP for review is that the policy has led to mounting food stocks and adversely affected crop diversification.

‘Assured price’

“The reality, however, is that farmers are not being taken out of this cycle (wheat/paddy). In order to bring crop diversification, there's a need to fix proper remuneration and assured market. Government should ensure a mechanism where farmers can get an assured remunerative price for crops cultivated by them other than wheat and paddy,” Mr. Singh said.

Noted economist at Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University, Prof. M.S. Sidhu, firmly believes that the current open ended procurement policy should continue in it’s current form. “The present policy is in the best interest of the country. Wheat and rice are basic food items.The present policy should continue in the interest of Punjab as well as the country,” said Mr. Sidhu.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/farmers-threaten-stir-if-procurement-policy-is-changed/article30721204.ece

It is not yet clear if the woman was a victim of a sexual crime before her murder. “Prima facie it appears like the body of a woman, possibly 25-30 years of age,” the SP said, adding the police was only making guesses as of now.

258,2020/02/02,Farmers’ collective to hold protest on February 13,"The All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee has called the Union Budget “anti-farmer and pro-corporate”. It would stage a nationwide protest on February 13 against the “pro-corporate” proposals in the Budget and the government’s failure to address the debts among farmers and the rising input cost and ensure profitable sale of crops.

‘No space for farmers’

In a statement, it said: “This is a Budget that has no space for farmers. The Narendra Modi government is yet again sending a message to farmers that it is the companies, and not the farmers, that matter to it.”

The All-India Kisan Sabha has also decided to join the protest. Its president Ashok Dhawale said the Union Finance Minister had said the government was committed to doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022, but the Budget she presented was one of the most anti-farmer Budgets in recent years. “A look at the Finance Bill reveals agriculture and allied sectors have seen massive cuts in allocations,” he said in a statement.

The Tobacco Institute of India said the increase in the national calamity contingent duty (NCCD) and the resulting rise in cigarette taxation, leading to higher tax arbitrage, would embolden illegal cigarette trade operators, who target India.

259,2020/02/02,"Three prisoners escape from Punjab jail, hunt launched","Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the escape of three prisoners from Central Jail, Amritsar, and has also directed Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa to immediately suspend, pending inquiry, all those responsible for prison security. A Statewide hunt was launched for the escaped prisoners on Sunday morning.

Escape in early hours

The incident came to light around 3.20 a.m., after the undertrial prisoners broke their barrack and escaped by scaling the inner and outer walls of the jail, as per the CCTV footage of the prison, said an official statement. The Chief Minister has ordered the Additional Director General of Police, Jails, to revamp prison security in the wake of the incident.

“The prison guards were alerted about the escape by other inmates, including the brother of one of the escaped prisoners, according to initial reports. There was no evidence of outside help, according to preliminary investigations, which suggest that the trio, among 61 prisoners in Barrack no. 7, Ahata No. 2, had planned the escape on their own,” said the statement.

Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta said in the statement that the men apparently made a hole in the wall of their barrack by removing about 10 bricks. They then appear to have scaled the inner wall (about 16 feet high) by standing atop the other, while they climbed the outer wall (21 feet approx.) by using a hook made of a steel bar and the cover of a quilt. They escaped the jail complex from a point near Tower No. 10, which was not under CCTV cover, he said.

One of the escaped prisoners has been identified as Vishal, hailing from Amritsar. The other two are brothers, identified as Gurpreet and Jarnail of Khadoor Sahib, the officer added.

The Shiromani Akali Dal on Sunday demanded an immediate dismissal of the Jails Minister and a probe by a sitting judge of the High Court into the escape of the three prisoners.

260,2020/02/02,Ex-IPS officer stopped by police from addressing AMU students,"The Aligarh police on Sunday stopped former IPS officer Abdur Rahman from addressing students protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Mr. Rahman told reporters that he was detained for an hour at the Lodha police station and was told that his presence on the campus could lead to a law and order situation.

The former IPS officer said he told the police officers that he would not speak against any political personality and would limit himself to educating students on CAA-NRC-NPR.

‘Police scared’

But when they didn’t agree, he said, as a law-abiding citizen he decided not to go to the campus but found the Aligarh police unusually scared of the students.

A police source said they had no problem with Mr .Rahman speaking but they felt his presence could be used by anti-social elements among students to make some virulent statements that could affect the law and order. “We have seen in the past such elements using the stage to spread hatred,” said the source.

Mr. Rahman resigned in December after the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha. He was an Inspector General in the Maharashtra police and was posted in the State Human Rights Commission at the time of his resignation. He described the CAA as unconstitutional and his resignation an act of civil disobedience.

In a related development, the fact-finding inquiry committee, formed by AMU Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor, has started its proceedings.

Headed by Justice V.K. Gupta (retd), former Chief Justice, High Courts of Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, it will look into the sequence of events that took place from December 13, 2019, and which led to the disturbances in the intervening night of December 15-16, when police were called inside the campus by the AMU administration.

262,2020/02/02,Social activist Aruna Roy’s sister dead,"Manya Jayaram Lindsay, younger sister of social activist Aruna Roy, died in Hitchin, U.K., after suffering from cancer in recent years. She had set up the preventive and curative health structure at the Social Work and Research Centre (SWRC), Tilonia — widely known as the Barefoot College — and studied indigenous people in the U.S. and Australia, and the transgender community in India.

Ms. Lindsay, 68, was married to a British national and had left in 1977 for the U.K., where she worked with the statutory county social work system till she resigned to take up her preoccupation with alternative medicine seriously.

Foundational work

She had earlier designed a model for “barefoot doctors” and “barefoot midwives” at the SWRC, which set the centre looking for the now celebrated barefoot solar engineers. Working with SWRC when it was building its foundational history, she had recruited doctors who were committed to brave living and working from a village with no electricity or running water.

Ms. Roy, founder member of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan and Magsaysay Award winner, said here on Sunday that the SWRC archives bore testimony to Ms. Lindsay’s methodical and painstaking work. She was also part of a team evaluating education programmes in rural Rajasthan.

Ms. Lindsay was an alumna of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, and got her Master of Social Work degree in 1973. She was a serious practitioner of Vipassana meditation. Diagnosed with breast cancer a decade ago, she had it treated with alternative medicine.

Her recovery gave shape to a monograph, Cancer: An Intuitive Healing, and she travelled extensively to share her experience. She was diagnosed with cancer again in 2017, which claimed her life. She passed away peacefully on January 16, refusing to take recourse to allopathic curative care.

‘Unwritten history’

Ms. Lindsay is survived by her two children, and sisters Ms. Roy and Nayanika Krishna. Ms. Roy said Ms. Lindsay’s death had signified the slipping away of a generation of dedicated social workers into an “unwritten history”, when young professional social workers had come up in the country.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/j0jrmk/article30720212.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ArunaRoy-Lindsay,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/social-activist-aruna-roys-sister-dead/article30719709.ece
263,2020/02/02,AMU panel probing campus violence tells students to submit statements,"The one-man judicial panel constituted by the Aligarh Muslim University to probe the violent incidents that rocked the campus in December 2019 has asked students and staffers at the AMU to submit their written statements by February 7, according to an official notification.

The probe is being conducted by retired chief justice of the Himachal Pradesh High Court V.K. Gupta.

As per the notification issued on Saturday, students and staffers at the AMU should submit their written statements to the probe panel by February 7.

A seven-member committee of senior faculty members instituted by AMU Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor will review all the FIRs registered by police against students in connection with anti-CAA protests is also expected to start functioning shortly, AMU spokesman Omar Peerzada said.

The committee is headed by Professor Najam Khalique of the Department of Community Medicine, Peerzada said.

He said the purpose of this committee is to help out the students who have been booked under “false charges.”

“This committee would explore all legal and administrative steps for preventing undue harassment of all innocent students,” he said.

Meanwhile, AMU officials said that there was a “marked improvement” in attendance in all faculties on Friday.

The university was closed early for winter vacations from December 16 last year, a day after students clashed with police during a protest against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act on campus.

The university was to reopen on January 6 but the vacation was extended owing to persisting tension over the changes in the citizenship law.

Students have been boycotting classes seeking the withdrawal of “false cases” against those who took part in protests against the CAA on December 15.

AMU Vice Chancellor Mansoor has sanctioned a grant of ₹1,50,000 each to two students who were seriously injured in police action on December 15 last year, the AMU spokesman said.

The decision was taken on the recommendation of a committee which had been constituted to decide compensation for the injured students, he said.

A senior university official said one of the demands of the protesting students was to give a permanent employment in the teaching staff to a student who had lost his hand in the December 15 violence.

“We have already decided to give an ad-hoc appointment. There is a procedure for making permanent appointments and we have paved the way for this appointment which would be done under the category of physically handicapped applicants,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/eyv10m/article30706910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL31-JAMIAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amu-panel-probing-campus-violence-tells-students-to-submit-statements/article30719273.ece
264,2020/02/02,Arrested militant ferried JeM terrorists in December 2019 too: Officials,"Sameer Dar, the cousin of the February 2019 Pulwama suicide bomber Adil Dar, has told interrogators that he had dropped a batch of terrorists to the Valley in December last year, officials said here on Sunday, two days after the former was arrested while attempting to ferry JeM terrorists to Kashmir.

Sameer was nabbed by police when he was trying to escape from Nagrota on Friday after Jaish terrorists opened fire on security forces.

Hailing from Kakpora area of Pulwama district in South Kashmir, Sameer confessed he had been successful in ferrying JeM terrorists to the Kashmir Valley last year and dropped them to Pulwama, the officials said.

Sameer claimed he was not aware about their whereabouts since but told the interrogators that they were carrying large ammunition including ‘steel core bullets’ — which can pierce through a normal bullet-proof vehicle.

This has triggered an alarm bell within the security establishment especially Border Security Force (BSF), which guards the International Border with Pakistan, as the force has been maintaining in its inter-departmental meetings that there has been no infiltration from the border.

On February 14 last year, Sameer’s cousin Adil blew himself in an explosive-laden car next to a CRPF bus killing 40 personnel.

Sameer told his interrogators that infiltration from across the border has been continuing and the militants were fanning in various parts of the South Kashmir especially in Pulwama and Tral areas, the officials said.

Sameer also told them that the militants were dropped at Kareemabad in South Kashmir. He also gave the details of the arms and ammunition being carried by the terrorists, indicating that the group also had M-4 carbine and ammunition of steel core bullets.

The steel core bullet has the capability to pierce through a static bullet proof bunker used during counter-terrorism operations, the officials said.

The first assault with such bullet was noticed on the New Year eve in 2017 when JeM terrorists had carried out a suicide attack on a CRPF camp in Lethpora in South Kashmir.

Five personnel of the paramilitary force were killed in the attack and one of them was hit by a bullet fatally eve though he was using a static bullet-proof shield provided by the Army, officials said.

A thorough inquiry into the attack showed that the bullet fired by the terrorist from the assault AK rifle was of steel core.

The AK bullets used in the armoury have a lead core covered with mild steel which cannot penetrate a bullet proof shield but after December 31, 2017 encounter and subsequent findings, the rules of the proxy-war changed, the officials said.

A detailed analysis of the previous suicide attacks was carried out.

The analysis of the terror attack on district police lines of Pulwama in South Kashmir in August 2017 showed that ‘steel core’ bullets had been used by the terrorists in that encounter with security personnel, the officials said. Eight security personnel had lost their lives in the terror strike.

The ammunition, according to the officials, was being modified from across the border with the help of Chinese technology of encasing the bullet with hard steel core.

The officials said the terrorists carrying M-4 carbine used by the US-led allied forces in Afghanistan have been extensively trained by the Pakistan’s external snooping agency ISI and could be used for carrying out sniper attacks in Kashmir Valley.

The weapons may have changed hands to JeM terror group as they were fighting along with Talibans in Afghanistan. The weapons are also used by the special forces of Pakistan Army.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/b0s4fb/article30719154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PULWAMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/arrested-militant-ferried-jem-terrorists-in-december-2019-too-officials/article30719155.ece

The body was discovered close to a dhaba near Shora village in Harchandpur area of the district on Saturday evening, police said. The body was found 50-60 metres away from the main road, said Rae Bareli Superintendent of Police Swapnil Mamgain.

It is not yet clear if the woman was a victim of a sexual crime.

“Prima facie it appears like the body of a woman, possibly 25-30 years of age,” the SP said, adding the police were only making guesses as of now.

Mr. Mamgain said that from the body’s condition it appeared the crime or murder was committed elsewhere and the body was dumped and burnt in Harchandpur.

The police have released a likely description of the woman to help in her identification.

267,2020/02/02,Hindu outfit leader Ranjeet Bachchan shot dead in Lucknow,"The leader of the right wing Vishwa Hindu Mahasabha was shot dead in the Uttar Pradesh capital on Sunday while he was out on a morning walk. Ranjeet Bachchan, 40, was shot in the head and his cousin Aditya Srivastava injured in the attack by unidentified assailants, who also snatched their mobile phones, according to Joint Commissioner of Police Naveen Arora.

In the complaint registered with the police, Aditya Srivastava said: “I, along with Ranjeet, went out for a morning walk. At around 6 a.m., on the road outside Globe Park, an unknown person who was wrapped in a shawl came from behind, and asked us to hand over our mobile phones. After this, the unknown person fired at Ranjeet, and also fired at me on my left arm. I ran from the spot.”

Police said Bachchan died on the spot while Srivastava suffered bullet injuries on his left hand. Four police personnel, including a sub-inspector, were suspended for laxity and a case has been registered at the Hazratganj police station in connection with the incident which occurred near the Collectorate building, days after Lucknow came under the Police Commissioner system, aimed at improving law and order.

The police released CCTV footage showing the suspect and announced a cash reward of ₹50,000 for information on the killer.

According to Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha president Swami Chakrapani, Bachchan was also the working president of the outfit’s Uttar Pradesh unit.

‘Weigh options’

Criticising Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for the incident, Swami Chakrapani said: “Such incidents throw a challenge to UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. He should weigh his options on whether election campaigning in other States is more important or improving the law and order of the State.”

268,2020/02/02,"Goa CM hails budget, Congress says FM silent on unemployment","Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant on Saturday welcomed the Union Budget 2020-21, terming it as “common man-centric”, while the opposition Congress slammed it saying that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was completely silent on unemployment.

The Shiv Sena also criticised the Budget saying it does not have anything specific for Goa.

“I congratulate Finance Minister Smt. @nsitharaman ji for a common man centric budget, and for taking ahead Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji’s vision for a robust and vibrant India,” Mr. Sawant said in a tweet.

Talking to reporters later, the Chief Minister said the State will benefit from the budget in a “big way”.

“The Union Budget will benefit Goa in a big way in tourism, industry, fishing and other sectors. We have submitted to the Centre a draft proposal to develop hinterland tourism and will soon present this revenue-generating project before it,” he said.

Mr. Sawant said the State budget which he is set to present on February 6 in the Assembly, will be on the lines of the Union Budget.

Goa Health Minister Vishwajit Rane also welcomed the budget.

Taking to Twitter, he said, “Congratulations to @nsitharaman ji for an outstanding launch of #Budget2020. Also would like to thank you for allocating IRS 3000 crore for skill development. Looking forward to reach newer heights under your able leadership.”

Leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Digambar Kamat, however, said the Finance Minister neither mentioned anything about unemployment nor gave any action plan to support the proposals she made in the Budget.

The Shiv Sena said the Budget does not offer anything specific for the State.

Shiv Sena State unit vice-president Rakhi Prabhudesai Naik said the Modi government has specifically left out Goa, as there was nothing encouraging in the Budget for the State’s tourism and mining industries.

“Moreover, the coastal State has been missing from the list of five iconic heritage sites, where the Centre plans to set up museums,” she said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/goa-cm-hails-budget-congress-says-fm-silent-on-unemployment/article30718214.ece
269,2020/02/02,Uttar Pradesh hostage-taker had studied other cases: Police,"The man, who had taken 23 children captive in a Uttar Pradesh village, had apparently planned it over a month and studied similar cases of hostage crisis, police said on February 1.

Subhash Batham, a murder accused, had taken the children hostage after inviting them for a birthday party at his house in Farrukhabad’s Kasaria village on Thursday afternoon. The children were freed after the police barged into the house late on Thursday night and shot Batham dead.

“It seems Batham had planned it for a month,” Kanpur Range IGP Mohit Agarwal said. He added that Batham’s mobile phone has been seized.

Batham’s wife was also involved and had demanded ₹1 crore to free each child, he said

The police has analysed Batham’s phone and it has been found that “he was planning it for a long time, searching and downloading bomb-making techniques”, Mr. Agarwal said.

270,2020/02/02,"Removal of Modi’s portrait anti-national, say Bhopal Police","The Bhopal police on Saturday claimed the unapproved removal of portraits of President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi from the office of the chairman of the Madhya Pradesh Urdu Academy by an employee on Thursday night was “anti-national” and “could have incited communal violence”.

“The incident had the potential to incite violence between Hindus and Muslims. Moreover, it was anti-national,” Sanjeev Kumar Chauksey, in-charge at the TT Nagar police station in Bhopal, told The Hindu.

Based on a complaint by the Academy’s chairman Aziz Qureshi, police registered a case under Section 153B(1)(c) — imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration; assertions concerning the obligation of any class of persons likely to cause disharmony — of the IPC. “The accused is absconding,” said Mr. Chauksey.

However, an Academy official, requesting anonymity, claimed the employee, after initial inquiry, was merely suspended and he was at his home. The Academy’s secretary, Hisamuddin Faruqui, refused to comment.

On Friday morning, former BJP MLA Surendra Nath Singh led scores of party workers to the Academy, managed by the State government. They raised slogans against the Congress government, and submitted portraits of Mr. Modi and Mr. Kovind to the Academy.

“Though run by the Congress government, the Academy succumbed to the BJP’s pressure to file a complaint against its own employee without a proper internal inquiry and got an FIR registered against him,” said an Academy official. He claimed the Academy had picked the accused as a “scapegoat”.

While the watchman claimed to have seen the accused removing the portraits, the accused denied the charge. Since the controversy broke, he has gone incommunicado. “Mr. Qureshi recently took charge and we’re in the process of helping him settle down. Offices were moved too, and maybe the portraits were removed briefly for cleaning. It is part of the routine and is a non-issue,” said the official.

He denied claims in the local media that the employee was expressing his protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

In 2009, the Election Commission of India wrote to the Centre and the States that while the photographs of Prime Minister, Chief Ministers and Ministers should not be displayed in government offices, the instruction was not applicable to the President and Governor. It said displaying photographs of political leaders still active in public life may disturb the level playing field for politicians of other parties.

The 27-year-old from Karnataka was named the Player of the Tournament for scoring 224 runs in the five-match series at an average of 56.

“I am batting really well now and I am happy to do the roles I am doing for my side. Not thinking too much about the T20 World Cup at the moment, but hopefully I can continue batting this way,” he said.

The T20 World Cup will be held in Australia from October 18 to November 15.

India notched up a rare 5-0 whitewash over New Zealand with a seven-run win in the fifth and final T20 International and Rahul said the team’s ability to find answers in difficult situations was the key to its success.

“I am pleased. It is great to be standing here winning 5-0. Very happy that my performances could result in victories for India. We were happy to come into this series with confidence and to keep executing our skills every game. We came up with answers from every situation and it is a great result for me and the side,” he said.

“I think it is a winning habit that we have cultivated wherein we want to win every time we step onto the ground. As a team we keep believing in each other. Leading up to the World Cup, there were a few strategies that we wanted to try out. It just keeps giving us more and more confidence to keep going around.”

India will next play three ODIs against New Zealand beginning on February 5 and Rahul said they will follow the same process to achieve success in the 50-over format.

“We’ll relax a little bit over the next couple of days and enjoy the victory. But once we start with the next series, the process will remain the same,” he said.

India notched up a rare 5-0 whitewash over New Zealand with a seven-run win in the fifth and final T20 International in Mount Maunganui.

“We need everyone to be the best versions of themselves. It is all about laying the vision in front of the boys, the way you think, prepare. The guys are taking notice of it and they realise that the team needs 120 percent from them every time,” Kohli said.

“Because only then you will find ways to win. That has been a massive change for us in the last two-three years. We have seen the results; we obviously won’t win everything and these victories give a lot more pleasure than the one-sided victories.”

With Kohli resting himself from the inconsequential final game, Rohit Sharma was the stand-in skipper, but the opener suffered a calf injury while batting and had to retire hurt.

In his absence, K L Rahul led the side to victory.

Heaping praise on the team at the presentation ceremony, Kohli said: “All of us are really proud of how we played. It’s about finding ways to win. Today, all these young guys were on the field after Rohit’s unfortunate injury and them coming together and handling the pressure.

“That gives me a lot of pleasure watching from the outside and they will take this momentum going forward for many years.”

Kohli also backed under-fire New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson, saying he is the right man to lead the Black Caps despite the 0-5 drubbing.

“Kane and me have similar mindsets, similar philosophies. It is amazing that despite being from different parts of the world, we have similar thinkings and we speak the same language,” he said.

“Despite what the scoreline suggests, I feel that New Zealand cricket is in the best hands and he is the right guy to lead this team. He is the perfect, perfect man to lead them. I wish him the best of luck and power to lead this side in the future. They are a side everyone loves to watch and play against.”

It was the first time that New Zealand lost three or more matches in a bilateral T20I series at home. The hosts had gone down 0-2 to England back in February 2008.

New Zealand stand-in skipper Tim Southee said there wasn’t much difference between the two sides.

“It’s another close one, unfortunately on the wrong side again. If you give them a sniff, they take it with both hands. I don’t think it is a massive gap, the scoreline does suggest that, but we only need to do the smaller things better,” he said.

The two teams will next play a three-match ODI series beginning on February 5 and Southee hoped that the hosts will put up a better show with new players coming into the side.

“The ODIs are a different format, new personnel come in and it is a format where we have done well,” he said.

India pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who was adjudged the Man of the Match for his three-wickets haul, said he always had the belief that a couple of good overs can change the complexion of the game.

“Feeling very good. The match got close at one point but we had belief that if we can squeeze in one or two good overs, the match can get close,” he said.

“It was windy, I was trying to use the wind and the longer side of the boundary. Very happy with the learnings, different ground dimensions, first time in New Zealand, great result.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/73mdxs/article30719443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ViratKohli,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-t20i-series-captain-virat-kohli-press-conference-after-5-0-win/article30719445.ece
275,2020/02/02,India registers 5-0 sweep against New Zealand in T20I series,"India choked New Zealand yet again to turn it around for a seven-run win in the fifth T20 International, giving them a rare 5-0 series whitewash in the shortest format in Mount Maunganui on February 2.

The Indian pacers, led by ever-reliable Jasprit Bumrah, shared seven wickets among them for 25 runs in match-changing 7.2 overs to restrict the Kiwis to 156 for nine while defending 163 for three.

Bumrah conceded just 12 runs in his four overs and got rid of three batsmen, bowling block-hole deliveries during death overs.

India’s total was built around stand-in skipper Rohit Sharma’ 60-run knock after they elected to bat.

Tim Seifert (50) and Ross Taylor (53) kept the Black Caps in hunt for a consolation win but the hosts again fell near the finish line.

This is only third time that India have whitewashed opponents in away T20 series and first time in a five-match rubber. India had blanked the West Indies 3-0 in 2019 and beat Australia 3-0 in 2016.

New Zealand got off to a poor start and were quickly reduced to 17 for three in the fourth over. Bumrah had Martin Guptill (2) lbw, and Sundar bowled Colin Munro (15). Tom Bruce’s run-out didn’t help the situation either.

Taylor and Seifert came together at that juncture, putting on 99 runs for the fourth wicket, raising vision of an improbable win.

Seifert reached his half-century off 29 balls, including five fours and three sixes. while Taylor got to his half-century in 42 balls. He hit five fours and two sixes.

They took 34 runs off Shivam Dube in the 10th over, after which KL Rahul, who led in absence of inured Rohit Sharma, had to take corrective measures. He brought back his frontline pacers and they both etched out wickets.

Navdeep Saini (2-23) dismissed Seifert and then Bumrah bowled Daryl Mitchell (2) with a searing yorker.

New Zealand’s chase was all but over when Mitchell Santner (6) holed out of Shardul Thakur (2-38) and Manish Pandey held a fine running catch at long on.

Ish Sodhi smacked 16 off 10 balls to provide some fireworks at the end but it was not enough.

Earlier, Rohit, batting at number three, was retired hurt after injuring his left calf whilst hitting a six and walked off the field in discomfort. He faced 41 balls and hit three fours as well as three sixes.

Virat Kohli was expectedly rested, with Rohit coming in, and it was the only change for India from Wellington. Rishabh Pant was ignored once again.

For New Zealand, Kane Williamson didn’t recover on time and Tim Southee led the side once again.

Despite Rohit’s return, Sanju Samson (2) continued to open the innings and it didn’t work again. Yet another opportunity went abegging as he hit straight to extra cover and was out for two runs.

KL Rahul (45) and Rohit added 88 runs for the second wicket, providing vital momentum to the Indian innings.

The in-form duo dominated the Black Caps’ attack and put on 50 off just 35 balls. Rahul hit four fours and two sixes in his 33-ball stay.

He fell in the 12th over against the run of play and finished with 224 runs in the series, the most for an Indian batsman in any bilateral T20I series.

Sharma scored his 25th T20I half-century off 35 balls. He looked to accelerate but then injured himself in the 17th over and retired.

The loss of both Rahul and Sharma impacted the Indian innings, and they lost all momentum on a slowing wicket.

Shreyas Iyer smacked 33 off 31 balls, including a four and two sixes, but couldn’t push the score past the 170-mark.

Manish Pandey scored 11 not out off four balls, with a four and a six.

276,2020/02/02,T20 tri-series: Indian women lose to Australia,"Indian women suffered a four-wicket loss against the mighty Australia after a disappointing batting performance in their second match of the T20 tri-series in Canberra on Sunday. India struggled to 103 for nine in 20 overs after being asked to bat. The visiting team’s bowlers did well to stretch the game till the penultimate over but there were not enough runs on the board.

Elysse Perry was the undisputed star of the game, picking up three wickets in one before before making 49 off 47 balls in Australia’s chase.

India had beaten England in the tournament opener while Australia had lost to England in a Super Over finish on Saturday, leaving all three teams with a win each. “Our lower order definitely needs to bat a lot better, especially when the top-order doesn’t get runs. However, really appreciate the performance of the bowlers,” said India skipper Harmanpreet Kaur at the post-match presentation.

India next play against England at the Junction Oval in Melbourne on February 7.

Barring opener Smriti Mandhana (35) and Harmanpreet (28), Indian batters showed complete lack of application on a pitch offering extra bounce.

India lost their last six wickets for 21 runs with pacer Perry (4/13 in 4 overs) picking three of them in 14th over over, removing Harmanpreet, Taniya Bhatia and Deepti Sharma.

Sixteen-year-old Shafali Verma, touted as the next big thing in women’s cricket, lasted only three balls while Jemimah Rodrigues crawled to 1 off 11 balls, leaving their team at 16 for two in three overs. The experienced Mandhana and Harmanpreet stitched a 40-run stand before the latter’s dismissal triggered a collapse.

The spin-heavy Indian bowling attack did all they could with left-arm spinner Rajeshwari Gayakwad taking two wickets for 18 runs in four overs. Offie Deepti Sharma, who opened the bowling, too kept things tight taking one wicket for 18 runs in four overs.

The tri-series is an important preparatory event ahead of the T20 World Cup beginning in Australia on February 21.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tjx412/article30718520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKET-ASHES-ENG-AUSWOMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/t20-tri-series-indian-women-lose-to-australia/article30718523.ece
277,2020/02/02,Ind A vs NZ A | Shubman Gill smashes double-century ahead of New Zealand Test series,"Shubman Gill is expected to retain his place in India’s Test squad after scoring an unbeaten 204 for the A team in the drawn four-day game against New Zealand A here on Friday.

Resuming the day four at 127 for two, India A went on to make 448 for three in their second innings with Gill scoring his second double-century on an away tour (the first one came in West Indies last year).

Also amongst the runs were Priyank Panchal (115 off 164) and Test regular Hanuma Vihari, who stayed unbeaten alongside Gill on 100 off 113 balls.

Gill’s 279-ball effort comprised 22 boundaries and four sixes. Vihari’s quickfire century comprised 11 fours and three sixes. He and Gill shared an unbeaten 222-run stand for the fourth wicket.

It was a much improved batting effort from India A as the pitch eased out at the Hagley Oval. The team, captained by Vihari, made 216 in the first innings in which Gill was the top-scorer with 83.

In response, New Zealand A had amassed 562 for seven before declaring the innings.

Mayank Agarwal, who will open alongside Rohit Sharma in the two-Test series against New Zealand later this month, had a forgettable outing in the game as he got out for a duck in both the innings.

After a fine double-century, Gill is certain to retain his place in the Test squad. The 20-year-old was also part of the squad in the home series against South Africa and Bangladesh but did not get a game.

Gill, who had made his India debut in the ODI series in New Zealand last year, is likely to warm the bench in the upcoming Test series with India having a settled opening pair in Agarwal and Rohit.

The Test squad will be announced soon.

278,2020/02/02,"Chepauk I, J and K stands | Clearance for gym demolition by Monday","We have now reached the end-game of almost a decade-long lockjam over the I, J, and K stands at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium.

The three stands of the iconic stadium at Chepauk were last opened in December 2012, when India played Pakistan in an ODI series.

The issue in contention is the creation of eight metres of setback space between the Madras Cricket Club (MCC) and the ‘K’ stand by demolishing 12 metres of the MCC gym as mandated by the court.

The Hindu has learnt from a source close to the issue that MCC, which had formally applied for the demolition order, was likely to get the clearance by Monday.

“We are almost certain of getting the go-ahead from the relevant authorities on Monday, and the demolition of the gym could start on the same day or from Tuesday,” said the source.

The three stands can seat close to 12,000 spectators. “We are sure that for the next edition of the IPL, the I, J, and K stands along with all other stands will be available for the public,” the source said.

The cricket-loving Chennai people will be the winners.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/m2qheu/article10011100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MACSTADIUM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/chepauk-i-j-and-k-stands-clearance-for-gym-demolition-by-monday/article30718414.ece
279,2020/02/02,Maninder Singh and Sanjeev Sharma join selector race,"Former Test left-arm spinner Maninder Singh and medium-fast bowler Sanjeev Sharma, both from Delhi, have applied for the post of National selector.

It is understood that they have joined the race since the Board had given indications that the zonal system of picking National selectors is likely to be done away with.

The 54-year-old Maninder, who played 45 First Class matches, including 35 Tests, had recently accepted the responsibility of heading the Delhi and District Cricket Association’s Cricket Advisory Committee. Sanjeev, who played the last of his two Tests in 1990 on the tour of England, has been a National junior selector.

Former Vidarbha off-spinner Pritam Gandhe, who figured in 100 First Class matches, has applied for a spot in the National junior selection committee, just as former Test wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia, who played 140 First Class matches, including 44 Tests.

Among those who also are in the fray are L. Sivaramakrishnan (76 FCM, 9 T), B.K. Venkatesh Prasad (123, 33), Ajit Agarkar (110, 26), Rajesh Chauhan (99, 21), Amay Khurasiya (119 FCM).

According to a Board source, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly is in favour of abolishing the zonal representation in the National selection committee. “In the past, there was reason to have zonal representation since information on many matches was not easily available to all the members.

“Now the system is selectors don’t watch matches involving teams within their zone. Even the Duleep Trophy is not played on the inter-zonal basis anymore. It is better to have deserving and best candidates as National selectors. It brings more strength to the committee,” said the Board member.

The selectors would be picked by a three-member CAC comprising Madan Lal, R.P. Singh and Sulakshana Naik.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/imkis6/article30716456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02MANI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/maninder-singh-and-sanjeev-sharma-join-selector-race/article30716457.ece
280,2020/02/02,"Muslim organisations take out massive rally against CAA, NPR and NRC","Thousands of people from nearly 20 organisations marched from various places south of the city to gather at the Red Cross Junction on Sunday evening against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Population Register, and National Register of Citizens.

Leaders from the Tamil Nadu Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and a few other political parties joined the protesters from the Kovai Mavatta Sunnat Jama-ath Kolkai Kootamaippu, Jama-athul Ulema Sabai, Indian Union Muslim League, Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam, Popular Front of India, Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, All India Imam Council, Socialist Democratic Party of India, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi and a few other organisations to register their protest.

Voicing slogans against the Central government and accusing it of attempting to divide people along religious lines and polarise the society, the protesters waved national flags and mobile phones lit with flash lights.

The organisations passed resolutions saying that the CAA was against the Constitution and threatened the secular fabric of the country, asking people to not cooperate in the NPR exercise, urging the State government to not allow the NPR exercise in the State, demanding the arrest of Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji for stoking communal flames, condemning the arrest of students who protested against CAA and asking the Central government to focus on reviving the economy.

The protesters also passed a resolution expressing disappointment at the Supreme Court for passing orders that favoured the Central government and did not reflect the people’s sentiments.

The Coimbatore City Police had deployed personnel from Armed Reserve and those it had requisitioned from neighbouring districts.

The Rapid Action Force personnel were also present around the protest venue. They had deployed water canons and drones to monitor the movement of people.

281,2020/02/02,Flower growers hail Kisan Rail Scheme,"The announcement of a Kisan Rail Scheme of trains with refrigerated coaches for farm produce has cheered flower growers of Hosur. At present, farmers incur about ₹50 per kg on both cargo charges and transportation from farms to Bengaluru airport adding up to ₹2.5 per stem to the final price of the flowers in the market.

“The Kisan Rail, we hope will be from Coimbatore to Delhi, which will bring down the handling of the produce from seven times (in cargo flight) to four times (in rail). This will also bring the cost of reaching the market to ₹20 per kg, says Bala Siva Prasad, president, Hosur Small Farmers Association. Similarly, Krishi Udan to provide connectivity to various routes, farmers hope, will eventually include Hosur. This was a demand that was made three years ago by farmers, says Mr. Prasad.

However, for Hosur’s flower growers, the import duty on plastic flowers – a product that has seen a spike in import along with Chinese toys impacting on flower growers and also the environment – has not been touched upon. The flowers growers of Hosur and Pune (another important flower production and export centre) have long been calling for a hike in import duties for plastic flowers since a ban on import of plastic flowers will be incompatible with the WTO regime.

“We demanded a 500 % hike on plastic flowers, since that would deter imports, or alternatively, tax on each use of plastic flowers. The plastic flowers once imported are used multiple times for events replacing fresh flowers and affecting flower growers. Instead, if the use of plastic flowers during decoration is taxed, it would be an active deterrent,” he says.

The third grievance is the budget not having a scheme to deal with agriculture surplus.

“The government imports onions, when there is a shortage for the public. But, when there is surplus, the government will have to procure the surplus from the farmer at a support price and make way for exports. A surplus becomes a farmer’s problem, and not that of the public.”",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/flower-growers-hail-kisan-rail-scheme/article30717999.ece

286,2020/02/02,Mixed response to budget,"The much needed stimulus that was expected of the budget to revive the economic slowdown was few and far between, said Vel Murugan, president, Hosur Small and Tiny Industries Association (HOSTIA).

Welcoming the extension of the debt restructuring scheme for MSMEs announced in the budget as a much need relief for the sector, HOSTIA has flagged the demands that have gone unaddressed. The debt restructure scheme was one relief that would bring down the monthly commitments of MSMEs. But, the liabilities of the MSMEs had gone up and there was no cash to run the show,” he said.

The MSMEs had sought adhoc loan, a part without security/documentation similar to the scheme in 2008-09 under the Manmohan Singh government, said Mr.Vel Murugan. “There is no cash to run the show, and adhoc loans, with 25% of the loan without security/documentation was given during the global slowdown in 2008-09. We expected something along those lines to revive the sector,” he said.

The industry had demanded waiver on import duty/local duties on machinery. For MSMEs to compete with the world, there was a dire need for technology upgradation and that demanded capital expenditure on machinery. But the import/local duty on machinery needed waiver to enable MSMEs to invest in upgradation. While the losses had gone up, the liability had remained the same by way of standard expenditure such as salaries, bank liability, maintenance among other things. The MSMEs had blamed the “GST as the first culprit” for this slowdown in their sector. The MSMEs here had also demanded waiver on interest on bank loans for the current and the next fiscal. “That was our only way to offset at least 25% of out losses, but that announcement was not made,” said Mr. Vel Murugan.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mixed-response-to-budget/article30716516.ece

Senthil Kumar on Friday inspected the land inside reserve forest area at Suriyur village in Panamarathupatti block where forest officials recently removed 25 huts and cleared the crops cultivated in the land.

The village is located in between Jarugumalai and Jalluthumalai where many families had erected houses and were carrying out agriculture for many years. On January 27, forest officials along with officials from the revenue and police departments removed the huts, cleared the crops and evicted the people residing there. The officials said that the land belonged to the Forest Department and 267 acre was reclaimed.

Murugesan, a villager, submitted petition to the Judicial Magistrate seeking an inquiry into the demolition of their houses, following which a one-man committee headed by retired Judge Rajaram was appointed. Mr. Rajaram held inquiries with the people inside the forest area. However, the villagers wanted the magistrate to hold the inquiry.

On Friday evening, the magistrate along with revenue officials and police personnel walked into the forest for five km from Kuralnatham and reached the village. He inspected the damaged huts, farm land, closed well and held inquiries with the people. Tahsildar Madheswaran told the magistrate that there was no village by the name Suriyur and said that the land belonged to the Forest Department.

The magistrate told the villagers that the Forest Department cited Forest Rights Act and Supreme Court direction and had removed encroachments. However, an inquiry would be conducted to find out whether the villagers could continue using the land for farming activities as they were residing there for many years. He said that a decision would be taken after receiving the committee report.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/iqbsa3/article30716475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA02INSPECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/judicial-magistrate-inspects-land-where-huts-were-removed/article30716476.ece
290,2020/02/02,"Budget announcements to benefit some industries, disappoint others","Announcements in the Union Budget are expected to support some sectors here, but have not met the demands of some others.

G. Karthikeyan, convenor of the economic affairs and taxation panel of the Confederation of Indian Industry, Coimbatore Zone, has said in a press release that allocations have been made for different sectors - healthcare, renewable energy, education, etc.

“We will need to wait and see if these will spur growth,” he said. A simplified system has been introduced for personal income tax to increase the disposable income with individuals.

The United Planters Association of Southern India has said that there is a marginal increase in allocation of funds to commodity boards. Reduced allocation in the previous budgets have affected the plantation sector sand disbursements under development schemes are pending. However, there is no relief on some of the issues that are of concern to the plantation sector, such as sharing of social costs, said AL. RM. Nagappan, president of UPASI.

The Federation of Indian Export Organisations Southern Region chairman Israr Ahmed has said that announcements related to logistics, marine exports, and cold supply chain will help the exporters. MSMEs and exporters face financial crunch and introducing the NIVRIK Scheme is expected to enhance credit availability to exporters.

According to J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises, the needs of the micro and cottage units have not been met.

The units sought relaxations in GST and lower interest rates. There is also no move to have a Defence Public Sector Undertaking in Coimbatore.

C. Sivakumar, president of Coimbatore and Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneurs Association, said the simplified system for IT and GST will benefit the micro units.

But, the sector needs support on bank finance and there is no announcement related to it.

The Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association president K. Maniraj said the budget does not have any move to support the micro units that are struggling for survival. Nearly 90 % of the farmers in the country use pumpsets. If they switch over to solar energy, they will not be able to use the pumpsets throughout the day. Agriculture pumpsets should be given full exemption from GST, he said.

R. Kalyanasundaram, president of Tamilnadu Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association, said the units with less than ₹5 crore annual turnover need not spend of tax audits now and this will lead to savings. The Budget addresses the needs of agriculture, infrastructure, and employment segments, he said.

Coimbatore Compressor Industries Association has said in a press release that while there are several measures proposed to boost rural economy, there is no effort to revive the manufacturing sector. Removal of Dividend Tax will benefit the corporate companies.

There should a similar support to the smaller units.

According to P. Nallathambi, president of Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers Welfare Association, the increase in threshold limit for tax audits is a big relief to small businesses. The allocation of ₹3000 crore for skill development will boost employment opportunities for youth and the extension of time to restructure stressed loans of MSMEs will benefit the units.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/budget-announcements-to-benefit-some-industries-disappoint-others/article30716469.ece
291,2020/02/02,‘Growth-oriented and positive’,"The textile and clothing industry has welcomed the announcements in the Union Budget calling it growth-oriented and positive.

K.V. Srinivasan, chairman of the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council, has said in a press note that implementation of the Remission of Duties and Taxes and Exported Products will go a long way in improving the competitiveness of the textile products in the export market. He also welcomed the measures announced for the MSME sector.

According to T. Rajkumar, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, the Government has considered one of the long-pending demands of the industry to review the Rules of Origin and FTA to curtail cheap imports from other countries. This decision will help the sector in the long run. He thanked Union Textile Minister Smriti Irani for taking forward the demands of the industry.

Chairman of Apparel Export Promotion Council, A. Sakthivel, said in a press release the Finance Minister has effectively addressed some of the key issues of the sector especially in areas such as ease of doing business. The refund of duties and taxes is an important step as there was significant shrinkage in policy support in the last few months. The Government should expedite FTAs with countries such as Australia, Canada and the EU, he said.

Ashwin Chandran, chairman of Southern India Mills’ Association, pointed out that PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid) attracts anti-dumping duty from $ 27 to $ 160 per tonnes depending upon the country of origin and India often faces shortage of PTA. This has curtailed the capacity utilisation of the polyester segment industry. He has said that this announcement has come as a boost for the PTA users and the entire man-made fibre textiles and clothing segment. Mr. Chandran also appealed to the government to announce a special scheme for cotton development. He said the Ministry of Textiles has already submitted a proposal for Technology Mission on Cotton – II.

The Indian Texpreneurs Federation said in a press release that the Budget has brought in structural reforms for the textile industry. With the abolition of anti-dumping duty on PTA, the Indian textile sector can move towards capturing 10 % share in the US market as against the current share of 2.5 %. Reviewing the Rules of Origin will help the textile sector in a big way.

The Tiruppur Exporters’ Association president Raja M. Shanmugham said the launch of NIRVIK will support small garment exporters. According to the South India Spinners Association, while several measures announced in the Budget will help the small-scale spinners, the demand to reduce the margin money for purchase of raw material using cash credit has not been met. Similarly. the need for long term loans has not been met.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/growth-oriented-and-positive/article30716462.ece
292,2020/02/02,Pumpset manufacturers seek relaxation of norms,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday announced in the Union Budget that the PM-KUSUM scheme will be expanded to provide support to 20 lakh farmers for setting up stand-alone solar pumps. Another 15 lakh farmers will be supported to solarise their grid-connected pump sets. In addition, a scheme to enable farmers set up solar power generation capacity on their fallow/barren lands and to sell it to the grid would be operationalised.

“The scheme is a welcome move. But such huge numbers of solar pumpsets will be purchased through tender and the Coimbatore manufacturers are mostly MSMEs. The manufacturers here make pumpsets and the integrators sell it with solar panels and controllers. Hence, they are unable to participate in the tenders. The Government should relax the norms,” said V. Krishnakumar, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association.

The scheme for another 15 lakh pumps to be connected to solar energy may benefit the manufacturers here if the farmers are allowed to buy the pumpsets. “When we talk of becoming a five trillion $ economy, agriculture and MSME sectors should be prioritised. The schemes announced for these sectors should be implemented properly,” he said.

There are several announcements in the budget that are expected to boost the rural economy. There is focus on water conservation, warehouses, organic farming, etc.

These are all expected to benefit the MSMEs in this region, added V. Lakshminarayanasamy, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore.

The pump manufacturers make solar pumps though the numbers are not high. If the announcement will lead to larger demand for solar pumps, the manufacturers here will stand to gain, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/pumpset-manufacturers-seek-relaxation-of-norms/article30716449.ece

“Amit Shah, what have you done to Delhi? Bullets are being fired in broad daylight. Law and order situation is in tatters. Elections will keep coming, politics will also continue, but for the sake of the people of Delhi, please pay attention to improving the law and order situation,” he said in a tweet.

“Mr. Shah and the BJP are conspiring to postpone the Delhi elections as they fear a loss,” AAP MP Sanjay Singh said, referring to the firing incident.

“On January 31, I had warned that the BJP is conspiring to vitiate the atmosphere of Delhi since it is scared of a humiliating defeat in the February 8 elections.

The incident at Shaheen Bagh comes just two days after a young man shot a anti-CAA protester near Jamia Millia Islamia, in the presence of police.

An eyewitness to Saturday’s incident, Mehraj Khan, said: “Two men arrived in a car. They walked to the first barricade at the protest site. Soon, one of them fired in the air in close proximity to the protesters. The police took away the man in a private car and not a PCR van.”

“Both the Jamia incident and the firing at Shaheen Bagh took place in front of the police. What is the administration doing? We are in constant discussion with the administration to sort out what is happening.”

Protesters at Shaheen Bagh called for “urgent mobilisation”, especially with the Assembly polls inching closer. “As we approach the Delhi elections on February 8, we request the citizens to join us at Shaheen Bagh on Sunday in solidarity with our cause of defending the Constitution.

Mr. Bharti, the sitting AAP MLA from Malviya Nagar, smiled at the people and while shaking their hands said: “Jhadoo ko vote dena (Please vote for jhadoo).” The jhadoo (broom) is AAP’s election symbol. As the group moved on foot, two autorickshaws followed playing Hindi tunes dubbed into election songs for the AAP leader.

“I am telling the people, if I have worked, then vote for me. There are a lot of projects still unfinished. The dream we have in our mind that Malviya Nagar should be a model constituency is half fulfilled. And if I come back to power, we will fulfil it,” Mr. Bharti told The Hindu.

He added that, if re-elected, he would implement an extensive rainwater harvesting project, and that “traffic decongestion” would be a priority issue.

Meanwhile, the residents were divided on the work done by the party.

“They have done good work. They have installed CCTVs, porta-cabins for security guards and benches in parks,” said Rita Bhandari, 52, a resident of B-Block. “Our children do not study in government schools but I have heard that they have improved,” she added.

“Mujhe koi benefit nahi mila hai (I have not received any benefits),” said Sachin Arora, 40, who runs a stationary shop in G-Block. “When he [Mr. Kejriwal] came to power we thought that he is from IIT and he will transform Delhi into a world-class city.

305,2020/02/02,"Exemptions, clauses for new income tax slabs irk citizens","The new income tax slabs announced in the Budget on Saturday evoked mixed reactions from the public.

While some hailed the move, others stated that there will not be “much gain” as taxpayers will have to forego a host of exemptions.

Sayan Kundu, a 30-year-old development researcher, said: “A person who claims exemption automatically reduces his taxable income. Here, the taxable income remains higher but the rate is lower. It does not look like this reduction [lower rate but higher taxable income] is sufficient. For someone who is not using the full extent of the 80C deductions, their losses will no doubt be less, but the gains are marginal. This is surely not the reform needed for faltering demand in a stagflation economy.”

Stating that the “supposed tax cuts make for good optics”, Gurugram-based software engineer Siddhartha Tiwari said: “I am waiting for the deduction list. If deductions like HRA, 24B and 80C have been removed, then I have been short-changed.”

Pranoy Maxwell, a civil service aspirant, said: “It seems that the central government has done this in desperation to get out of the economic slowdown. The Modi government wants to put more money in the hands of the people to spend.”

Delhi-based chartered accountant Arijit Basu said, “This Budget first raises hope of the salaried middle class people and then shatters it by applying clauses. It is an anti-investment budget. If one decides to go for the new tax regime, one will not get any deduction in life insurance, housing loan interest and so on.”

However, 28-year-old Zaki Zamrood, who works at a private firm in Noida, said: “It is a good move since it is optional. I do not have any investments, and submission of proof for these is a tedious process. This makes the process easier for people who do not wish to get into all this.”

Divya Sharma, an HR professional, said: “I think it will be useful for me because presently I lose about ₹25,000 in taxes, if that money is saved, it really will make a big impact on my life. However, the government will also be losing money, but I am sure they have thought of some way of making up for it.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/exemptions-clauses-for-new-income-tax-slabs-irk-citizens/article30716823.ece
306,2020/02/02,"Kejriwal would waste taxpayers’ money on protesters in Shaheen Bagh, alleges Adityanath","Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday alleged that his counterpart in Delhi, Arvind Kejriwal, would waste taxpayers’ money on “anti-CAA protesters at Shaheen Bagh if re-elected”.

At a meeting in support of BJP’s Karawal Nagar Mustafabad candidates — Mohan Singh Bisht and Jagdish Pradhan — Mr. Adityanath criticised both the Congress and AAP, saying “their people wanted protests like the one in Shaheen Bagh”. He accused AAP of setting the “worst example of being among political blackmailers operating in the country”.

“By doing dharna pradarshan in the name of protesting against the CAA, by raising slogans in support of Pakistan, by indulging in arson, violence...damage to public property, the Congress, Kejriwal and their people...what they want to prove?” Mr. Adityanath asked.

“He [Kejriwal] does not want good roads, potable water, expansion of the metro — all he wants is Shaheen Bagh...you have to decide whether you want all-round development or Shaheen Bagh...he will waste taxpayers’ money on feeding them biriyani,” he said.

Mr. Adityanath questioned the commitment of Mr. Kejriwal on women's safety, ending corruption and enactment of the Lokpal in Delhi. He also accused Mr. Kejriwal of seeking support from “a Pakistani Minister”.

“These people [Congress] used to shout slogans of women empowerment but the Naina Sahni case still happened. The Congress had overturned the judgment of a constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court in the Shah Bano case related to the issue of Triple Talaq,” he alleged.

Mr. Adityanath said Kejriwal’s Ministers are corrupt. He criticised Mr. Kejriwal and the Congress of being “stumbling blocks when it came to significant developments” such as Ram Mandir and Nirbhaya case.

“Kejriwal is responsible for the smog in Delhi. Only the BJP can tackle terrorists, naxals and criminals...only the BJP can keep the people of this country safe from these elements,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-would-waste-taxpayers-money-on-protesters-in-shaheen-bagh-alleges-adityanath/article30716810.ece
307,2020/02/02,1 dead in ammonia leak at Noida unit,"One man died and at least seven suffered injuries following ammonia gas leak at a Haldiram’s unit in Noida’s Sector 65 on Saturday, the police said.

DCP (Zone 2, Noida) Harish Chandra said that the deceased has been identified as 42-year-old Sanjeev who worked as a gas operator in the unit.

“Prima facie, it seems, he died due to inhaling the poisonous gas. We got a call at noon regarding the incident and called the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Around 300 people inside the building had to be evacuated,” he said.

“Sanjeev died during treatment. The rest of the victims were discharged after treatment,” Mr. Chandra said, adding cause of the leakage is being probed.

Deputy Commandment (NDRF) Ravindra Singh Kushwaha told The Hindu that a team of around 40 personnel in protective suits were deployed after getting a call about the incident at 12.30 p.m. “By the time the team reached the spot, the workers who had inhaled the gas were taken to a hospital by Haldiram’s team,” he added.

Effect lasted three hours

“Ammonia is used as a refrigerant. When it leaks, it first comes out in liquid form. It causes a burning effect in the respiratory system as well as on the skin. It can cause lung damage and even death. It seems the gas leaked from a welded spot in the pipeline. The staff had closed the regulators on both ends of the pipe but by that time, the damage had been done. It is a matter of investigation whether those who went inside to check the leakage wore the required safety gear or not.”

Mr. Kushwaha said that it took around three hours for the effect of the gas to subside. Firefighters were also pressed into service, he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/298rqr/article30718282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/haldijpg1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1-dead-in-ammonia-leak-at-noida-unit/article30716808.ece
308,2020/02/02,"Delhi again given stepmotherly treatment in Budget, says CM","Both the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress on Saturday criticised the Union Budget presented on Saturday.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that Delhi has yet again been given a “stepmotherly treatment”.

“Delhi has been given stepmotherly treatment in the Budget yet again. If Delhi is not the BJP’s priority, why should Delhiites vote for them? If the BJP is disappointing Delhi before the elections, what will they do after?” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted.

Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) chief Subhash Chopra termed the Budget “very disappointing” and said it will hamper the city’s development.

“There is no provision in the Budget for improving the law and order situation in the Capital, providing houses to the poor and creating jobs. The Budget is a ‘jumla’ to confuse and mislead people,” Mr. Chopra said.

Delhi Finance Minister Manish Sisodia termed the Budget a “failure”. At a press meet, he said: “Budget for education has come down from 3.6% to 3.2%. This is a fraud. At many points in the Budget, it seems that they are cheating.”

He added: “In this Budget, Delhi’s share in Central taxes has not been increased. It has been ₹325 crore since 2001-02. Delhi deserves its legitimate share in Central taxes to finance various developmental projects. The government had requested the Centre multiple times to enhance the allocation to at least ₹7,000 crore.”

‘Stagnant allocation’

Mr. Sisodia said the Delhi budget has increased from ₹8,739 crore in 2001-02 to ₹60,000 crore in 2019-20, whereas the share in central taxes remains frozen.

“There was a lot of expectation that the salaried class will get some rebate on Income Tax. However, the Central government has deceived the salaried class by its complicated announcement, which means nothing in real-term savings of hard-earned money. If one will not get any exemption on savings, what is the use of the new option?” he asked.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/tq0yuq/article30716796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE01BUDGET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-again-given-stepmotherly-treatment-in-budget-says-cm/article30716797.ece
309,2020/02/02,Blessed Bali,"When Vamana assumed the form of Trivikrama, He measured the world with one foot. His other foot reached Brahma Loka. Brahma washed His foot, and this water became the sacred Ganga river. Mahabali’s son Namuchi held on to the Lord’s foot, thinking he could keep the Lord from measuring land with His large feet. But the Lord swirled Namuchi away to the sky and continued to grow. Watching the Lord expand in height, Mahabali thought perhaps the Lord would stop once he reached one of the three lokas which Bali ruled over. But the Lord went beyond these lokas and covered seven lokas. His stamp was now on everything. When there was nothing left for the Lord to measure, He asked Mahabali where to put His foot to measure the third portion of land promised to Him. Mahabali indicated his head, and the Lord pressed Bali down to patala loka, where he was to be ruler. Mahabali was not a great sage or devotee. But what good fortune he had to have the Lord place His foot on his head! This is a blessing His bhaktas crave for, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse.

Mahabali usurped Indra’s territory. Taking something that did not belong to him was the wrong that Mahabali committed. But he had always been generous. That is why he was banished to the netherworld, which he was to rule. Suppose a child in our family takes a toy belonging to the neighbour’s child, and this leads to a row, we take the toy away from our child and return it to the neighbour’s child. But we also console our child by saying that we will get it a better toy later. In the same vein, the Lord returned Indra’s kingdom which Bali had taken, but He gave Bali unchallenged control over another loka. Like Aswattama and Vyasa, Mahabali too is a Chiranjeevi, that is, an immortal being.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/blessed-bali/article30720577.ece

311,2020/02/02,"Robot to assist in hip, knee replacement surgeries","The management of Sunshine Hospitals has launched fourth generation robot for hip and knee replacement surgeries at a ceremony held here on Saturday. The equipment called MAKO Robot can be used for the two forms of surgeries.

Managing director and chief joint replacement surgeon of the hospital, A.V. Gurava Reddy said robot-assisted surgery offers advantages such as better patient outcomes, reduced blood loss, quicker recovery and shorter hospital stay.

“Use of robotic technology ensures improved accuracy of knee and hip replacement surgery. It allows surgeons to perform partial knee replacement surgery which retains the healthy bone, muscles and cartilage ensuring faster recovery,” Dr Reddy said.

Doctors at the hospital said joint replacement surgery is the only solution to end-stage arthritis of knee or hip. Though the surgeries have proved to be effective, there is scope for improving accuracy in performing the procedures. “That’s where robotic technology comes in handy as it takes our accuracy from 95% to 100%.

312,2020/02/02,‘Need to engage more youth to change direction of humanity’,"President Ram Nath Kovind on Sunday said spirituality is India’s most precious gift to the world.

He was addressing over 40,000 abhyasis or practitioners after formally inaugurating Kanha Shanti Vanam of Shri Ram Chandra Mission, the world’s largest meditation centre, 40 kms from here, and said that Indian tradition of spirituality also focuses on the ideals of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ and ‘Sarve Bhavantu Sukhinah’. “For us, the entire world is one large well-knit family. We seek happiness for everyone on the planet,” he said.

He said that in a world full of anxieties, uncertainties, insecurities and hostilities, the responsibilities of organisations like Shri Ram Chandra Mission have increased manifold and they can provide the reassuring touch of a healer. “In order to change the direction of humanity, we need to take on board larger number of young people and engage them in the endeavours of building a better world,” he said.

Mr. Kovind expressed confidence that the global community of Shri Ram Chandra Mission will contribute towards making the planet a better place and transforming humanity into a better community, full of positive energy and happiness. “The Mission is promoting the great ancient tradition of Rajyog meditation in the modern world,” he added.

“I remember to have read in a book dedicated to the birth anniversary of Chariji (Parthasarathi Rajagopalachari) that when hejoined the Mission in 1964, the participation of abhyasis in Basant celebrations was only about 40. Today, the number of abhyasis runs into millions. I have been told that nearly 1.60 lakh visitors, mostly abhyasis, came to this campus from many parts of the world last year alone,” he said.

‘Simplicity is key’

“Simplicity is an important aspect of moderation — simplicity to the point of living life with minimum expectations, minimum needs and minimum impact on the environment,” he asserted.

Present global guru of the Mission, Kamlesh D. Patel, affectionately called Daaji, said that the readiness of Kanha Shanti Vanam as a seat of transformation through meditation is testimony to human endurance. “Over five years, Kanha Shanti Vanam’s evolution into a magnificent wellness destination complete with the world’s largest meditation centre was possible due to relentless efforts of thousands of our practitioners. Our work to ensure that heartfulness remains timeless has just begun,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2srri1/article30721389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy02Ramchandar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/need-to-engage-more-youth-to-change-direction-of-humanity/article30721383.ece

315,2020/02/02,"TS police trace 3,600 missing children in a single month","As many as 3,600 children, including 412 girls, engaged as labourers or seeking alms across the State were rescued by Telangana police under the sixth phase of ‘Operation Smile’ in January this year.

“Of the 3,600 rescued, 1,981 were reunited with their families while 1,618 were admitted in homes,” said Swati Lakra, IGP (Law and Order) and in-charge of Women Safety Wing.

To trace the missing children and those involved in child labour, bonded labour, micro industries, begging and trafficking, every year Operation Smile and Operation Muskaan are conducted for a month in January and July respectively, she said. “This year Operation Smile–VI was conducted in the State. Two weeks before the drive, a training session was conducted to bring coordination among all stakeholders and brief the teams on standard operation procedures to be followed while rescuing the children,” Ms. Lakra said.

Teams consisting of a sub-inspector and four police constables in each sub-division took part in the operation in coordination with Women and Child Welfare, Labour and Health department, apart from representatives of NGOs and shelter homes.

Since the launch of the programme, the teams rescued vulnerable children from railway stations, bus stations, religious places, traffic junctions, mechanic shops, brick industries, shops, tea stalls, footpaths etc.

Specific daily situation reports for collecting data were framed and such collated data was further used to know potential ‘black spots’ where most child labour and children were found in vulnerable conditions.

Extensive usage of technology by rescue teams in the form of facial recognition apps, TS Cop and DARPAN was the unique feature of this year’s drive, Ms. Lakra said.

Sharing further details about the operation, the officer said that of 3,600 rescued children, 1,015 boys and 227 girls hail from other States in the country and a few were from Nepal and Myanmar. “The database of children in child care institutions was very useful to compare photographs of missing children with traced and rescued children,” she added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/6pgh7b/article30721352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy02Child1col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-police-traced-3600-missing-children-in-jan/article30721340.ece

Many roads in our colony just like in many others lack footpaths and the road is not extended from wall to wall. As a result, municipality and the Cantonment staff, while sweeping, push the dirt and dust into corners and within a couple of hours, it finds its way back on the road. I urge the authorities concerned to instruct the staff to ensure full-width roads throughout. Instead of cutting/trimming trees, they can put insulated covering for electrical and cable wires passing through.

Barricade misuse

317,2020/02/02,Civic reception turns condolence meet,"It is a rare coincidence, but very sad. An untiring soldier of women’s education and their uplift, ex-MP M. Narayana Reddy passed away a few hours before he was to receive a civic reception arranged for him by scores of his followers and disciples. All were waiting at the venue expecting his arrival at least in an ambulance from hospital as he recovered from brief illness and was willing to come. However, the sad news shocked them all.

As the news spread, Minister for Endowment and Law A. Indrakaran Reddy, who was the chief guest of the function and former Assembly Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy, its president, decided to make it a condolence meeting. Just before that a brief book titled Maha Manishi Narayana Reddy was released by District Principal and Sessions Judge G.V. Subramaniam and former Minister S. Santhosh Reddy.

Announcing the sudden demise of Narayana Reddy to the utter shock of the audience, Mr. Indrakaran Reddy said he was a freedom fighter and protagonist of Telangana agitation. Mr. Suresh Reddy described him as not only an advocate by profession but also an advocate of women’s education and their progress. He was his guide and philosopher, he said.

Vijay Educational Institutions chairperson G. Amruthalatha, former Minister S. Santhosh Reddy, ZP Chairman D.

318,2020/02/02,‘Sanction funds for NH-44 expansion’,"The Telangana State unit leaders of the BJP met Road, Transport & Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari and urged him to sanction funds towards expanding the current four-lane National Highway 44 passing through Bowenpally, Kompalli and Medchal to six lanes, considering the rapid increase in traffic on this route, not only due to the rise in residential projects, but also as this road leads to North Telangana areas of Medak, Ranga Reddy, Nizamabad and Adilabad.

The NH-44 also leads to a key Outer Ring Road (ORR) junction at Kandlakoya and lies on the key MMTS route of Secunderabad-Bollarum-Medchal and Secunderabad-Moula Ali. Several defence establishments, including the Air Force Academy and others, have access through this road, hence the expansion has become imperative.

The party leaders also thanked the Minister for providing ₹12,000 crore for the 332-km. Regional Ring Road.

Meanwhile, the BJP leaders requested Vice President and Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu to take action against Rajya Sabha member K. Keshava Rao, representing Andhra Pradesh, for having “wilfully misled” the Telangana State Election Commission in order to cast his vote in the urban local body elections in Tukkuguda municipality as an ex-officio member from Telangana.

“The conduct of the member unequivocally attracts provisions and stipulations of the Ethics Committee,” they said in a memorandum submitted to Mr. Naidu in New Delhi on Saturday. The leaders led by party president K. Laxman charged the ruling TRS party, during the entire course of elections, “has taken recourse to blatant misuse of power right from the stage of issuing notification till the last phase of election of chairman, vice-chairman, mayor and deputy mayor.”

The party alleged that the “scale and magnitude of misuse of power is unprecedented in history” with the SEC remaining a mute spectator to the entire process.

Mr. Rao was elected to Rajya Sabha before formation of the State, and after the State formation, he was declared elected from AP as per draw of lots held in May 30, 2014.

Therefore, he cannot register himself as member of another State, that too for the purpose of casting vote as an ex-officio member but he did so “illegally” to cast his vote in Tukkuguda municipality which is against the TS Municipal Act 2019.

“It is desecration of Constitution to say the least and blatant flouting of norms and ethics when a member of the elders House of Parliament ought to behave in an exemplary manner.

320,2020/02/02,Raw deal for BCs in Union Budget: Krishnaiah,"The federation of 14 Backward Classes’ associations has criticised the Union Budget presented on Saturday stating that in spite Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailing from a BC community, a raw deal was handed to them as a meagre ₹1,046 crore has been allocated for them out of ₹30.42 lakh crore budget.

Stating that BC communities comprise 70 crore of the country’s population, National Backward Classes Welfare Association president R. Krishnaiah ridiculed that the amount was not sufficient even to buy toffees to BC communities.

In a statement issued after a meeting of the federation here on Sunday, he said injustice was being done to BC communities in spite of the Mandal Commission recommendations made 26 years ago for implementing 27% reservation to them in education and employment.

Students from the BC communities are being denied scholarships, fee reimbursement, hostel facility, residential schools as there is insufficient allocations all through.

He sought to know how the Centre could justify the allocation of ₹1,046 crore for BC communities in 29 States when several State governments were allocating sizeable amount – Telangana - ₹5,000 crore, Andhra Pradesh - ₹18,000 crore, Tamil Nadu - ₹7,000 crore, and Karnataka - ₹6,000 crore.

No matching grant

If divided among all States, the Central allocation would end up in every State getting less than ₹35 crore. Although the Centre was supposed to given 50% matching grant to the BC welfare schemes implemented by State Governments, such contribution was being denied for the last 26 years, he alleged.

Mr. Krishnaiah said there was no mention of any allocation of National BC Development Corporation in the Union Budget even as community-based vocations are facing extinction due to mechanisation. There was also no mention of 14 lakh vacancies in Central government departments and pubic sector undertakings.

The BC communities federation plans to take up a ‘Chalo Delhi’ protest on March 17 with a demand to increase the budget allocation to ₹50,000 crore for them.

BC Associations leaders G. Krishna, N. Venkatesh, A. Ramkoti, J. Anji, V. Ramakrishna, G. Mallesh, B. Krishna T.R. Chander, Upender Goud, C. Rajender, Madhusudan, S. Venkanna and K.

Not a single project from Telangana received Central funding during the last six years and this is a collective failure of the Centre and the State governments and this needs to redressed, senior Congress leader Mohammed Ali Shabbir said in a statement here. Even the promises made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act have not been fulfilled.

TPCC president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy also criticised the budget saying Telangana was totally neglected and there is nothing for unemployed youth, farmers, women, students, and the sectors that generate jobs have been completely ignored.

Mr. Reddy said the budget speech was completely silent on rising unemployment in the country which is at 45-year high and it failed to specify as to how it plans to double the income of farmers by 2022. The agriculture growth rate must be at least 11% for doubling the income but growth rate in agriculture was at 2.9%.

The Congress said that in 2019-20 budget, Telangana was promised ₹ 19,718 crore as its share in Central taxes. In the Revised Estimates, it has been reduced to ₹15,987 crore. This was a straight reduction of ₹3,731 crore or almost 18.9%. Further, for 2020-21, only ₹16,726 crore has been earmarked.

The party is of the view that Mr. Rao raised ₹2.5 lakh crore loans with an eye on the Central funds but now Telangana will suffer with huge debts and meagre share from Central government.

Mr. Shabbir Ali slammed Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for presenting a non-realistic budget. She failed to increase the confidence of investors, and they lost ₹3.46 lakh crore within hours of budget presentation, he alleged.

Mr. Shabbir Ali also said there was no significant increase in the budget for Minorities Welfare. As against ₹4,700 crore in 2019-20, this year ₹5,029 crore has been earmarked with an increase of just ₹329 crore. However, he said nearly 71% of the budget allocated in 2019-20 has remained unspent.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/congress-for-all-party-panel-meet-with-pm/article30721199.ece

324,2020/02/02,KCR against Palle Pragathi photo ops,"It is not uncommon to see Ministers, MLAs and officials engaging themselves in civic work like sweeping while launching programmes related to them.

But officials who followed the tradition during the Palle Pragathi programme, envisioning improvement of village level infrastructure, were in for surprise.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao took objections to the Ministers and officials posing for photographs while participating in the programme.

Ministers, MLAs and officials were not there to sweep the roads themselves and there are people designated to do the job.

The government is paying salaries for staff recruited for the purpose and it is the responsibility of the Ministers and officials to ensure that they discharge their duties effectively, he said.

By saying so at a review meeting the other day, the Chief Minister sent out a strong message for the Ministers and officials to effectively monitor the implementation of the work rather than “namesake” participation in the programmes launched for larger public good.

Caught on the wrong foot

The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is caught on a wrong foot by the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the matter of elections to Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACS) as the former has been tight-lipped on the conduct of elections to the existing number of societies in a hurry, instead of taking up their reorganisation as planned earlier.

“The ruling party has been repeatedly requesting the Centre to sanction more Navodaya Schools, more Kendriya Vidyalayas, more Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas in tune with the increased number of districts in the State following reorganisation of districts in October 2016. However, its silence on the reorganisation of PACS is smacking political opportunism,” BJP State vice president S. Malla Reddy alleged.

From the political perspective, the cooperative elections hold not much significance to the ruling since it has most of the elected bodies from village to State level – gram panchayats (though held on non-party basis), mandal parishads, zilla parishads, municipal councils, municipal corporations, besides the Legislative Assembly and Council, yet the conduct of cooperative polls in such a hurry is raising eyebrows!

Nominations of top contenders rejected

The election to Telangana Olympic Association has taken a curious turn after the returning officer rejected the nominations of a senior IAS officer and a former TRS MP who is now in the BJP for the post of president. The elections are due for February 9 but the supporters of both candidates have threatened to stall the polls.

Interestingly, three nominations were filed for the post of president but two were rejected and the third candidate left in the fray was none other than the president of a parallel olympic association who merged his group with the association now going to polls.

To add to the confusion, the returning officer himself was replaced. The nomination of the IAS officer was rejected reportedly on grounds that he had not got clearance from concerned authority to contest poll.

327,2020/02/02,SSCB makes it a one-sided contest,"A quarter is a long time in modern hockey. It took just one period of 15 minutes for Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) to turn an evenly matched game into a one-sided competition, winning 3-1 against Air India to clinch its maiden National Championship title here on Sunday.

With both teams testing waters early on, there were little scoring chances for either through the first 30 minutes of play. Both teams wasted a penalty corner and with occasional forays into the opposition circle resulting in shooting wide or over, the game was largely restricted to the midfield.

Numerous turnovers

With almost half of its team made up of junior India campers, Air India managed to keep pace with the young Services side resulting in a fast game but also numerous turnovers from either side.

Tied goalless at half time, it finally took a defensive lapse from Air India for Rahul Rajbhar to wrong foot goalkeeper Adrian D’Souza and break the deadlock.

Services had been desperately trying till then, Ashis Topno being the fulcrum and feeding well from the middle but unable to find a gap in the tight AI defence.

Opening up space

The goal opened up space and the attack from either side. In an attempt to find the equaliser, AI kept moving ahead but the defence left much to be desired.

D’Souza had a bad day on the field, saving a few but repeatedly finding himself out of place. Two quick goals towards the end of the quarter saw Services take the upper hand.

AI tried its best to fight back, creating three PCs in the final quarter and getting half chances and managing to reduce the margin when Vishnu Singh finally tapped in a rebound but it was too little too late.

Up to potential

Earlier in the playoff for third place, Petroleum Sports Promotion Board (PSPB) finally played up to potential, registering an easy 3-1 win against Punjab & Sind Bank (PSB).

It was a vastly improved performance from the side that dominated the game, created more chances and did not allow space to PSB, hustling the opposition and showing a lot more urgency than it did in the semifinal. Despite missing a handful of PCs, each of its three goals were opportunistic, taking full advantage of defensive lapses from PSB.

The results: Final: SSCB 3 (Ajinkya Jadhav, Rahul Rajbhar, Jobanpreet Singh) bt Air India 1 (Vishnu Singh); Third place play-off: PSPB 3 (Roshan Minz, Armaan Qureshi, Tushar Khandker) bt PSB 1 (Parvinder Singh).",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/sscb-makes-it-a-one-sided-contest/article30719712.ece
328,2020/02/02,Underdog Air India stuns a lacklustre PSPB,"If names could win matches, PSPB would have strolled into the final of the Men’s Hockey National Championship (A Division) here. As it were, the star-studded side displayed none of the immense international experience it boasts of in its ranks, dishing out a pedestrian game to go down 5-2 against underdog Air India on Saturday.

It has been a while since Air India competed for the title in any major domestic tournament. With ageing warhorses leading and youngsters on contract taking the first flight out for a permanent job, the team has been able to find neither the right combination nor the stability required to perform consistently.

PSPB started well and got two goals in as many minutes, gaining a 2-0 lead in the 7th minute itself. But once things settled down, the chinks came to the fore. Air India regrouped, patiently building its attacks from either flank with Amir Ali and Somjeet taking the responsibility of setting up Mohd. Raheel and Sourabh Kushwaha upfront. Raheel finally tapped one in in a goalmouth melee.

Unrecognisable

Post half time, however, there was hardly anything from PSPB. Harjeet Singh and Tushar Khandker managed to hold the midfield together but with the defence unable to keep pace with the Air India attack and its own forwards messing up easy chances, it was of little use.

Players like Armaan Qureshi, Talwinder Singh and S.K. Uthappa, all having been part of title-winning India sides till recently, could not control or tap the ball in.

At the back, Raheel, Ajay Yadav and Kushwaha kept running circles around Devinder Walmiki and Diwakar Ram.

Raheel, who struck four times, was left unmarked despite being a constant threat and when someone did come up on him, managed to dodge him away with ease.

When PSPB did manage a gap or PC, goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh foiled them. For a team given little chance of winning, Air India coach Rajnish Mishra was visibly proud.

The other semifinal saw Services walking away with a deserved 2-0 win against Punjab & Sind Bank for its maiden final.

With several new recruits across its various wings, Services played attacking hockey and dominated the proceedings for a large part of the game. PSB defence was tested repeatedly but the Punjab side, true to its nature, managed to foil them but did not fall back, instead trying to get a goal of its own.

It made for exciting end-to-end action. Though Services had the upper hand, PSB had its chances, specially on counters, but could not capitalise on them.

The results: Semifinals: SSCB 2 (Jugraj Singh, Ajinkya Jadhav) bt PSB 0; Air India 5 (Mohd. Raheel Mouseen 4, Mohd. Faraz) bt PSPB 2 (Diwakar Ram, Armaan Qureshi).",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/ok2pbo/article30716339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02HOCKEY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/underdog-air-india-stuns-a-lacklustre-pspb/article30716340.ece
329,2020/02/02,Women’s hockey | SSB wins B division title,"Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) was crowned champion of the B division in the 10th senior National women's hockey championship at the National Games Hockey Stadium here on Saturday.

In the final, SSB prevailed over Steel Plant Sports Board (SPSB) 4-2 in the penalty shoot-out after the teams were locked 1-1 in regulation time. In the shoot-out, SPSB converted just one to SSB’s three.

SPSB's initial strategy to blunt SSB's prolific strikers Preeti Simran and Manisha Rathi paid off. Both strikers found it difficult to find space inside the rival box and SSB's initial forays fizzled out.

SPSB had more of possession in the midfield and the side looked dangerous in counterattacks. SPSB went ahead in the 18th minute as Shailja Kumari Gautham weaved her way into the D and drilled in a low shot from an acute angle.

SPSB continued its offensive game and came close to increasing the lead at least twice in the second quarter.

SSB regrouped after the break and displayed cohesiveness — which was missing in the first half — in the midfield.

Threatening move

The threatening moves came from both flanks and SSB earned a succession of penalty corners, the equaliser coming off one of them.

SPSB goalkeeper Nisha Yadav did well to repel the first shot from Babita but Ranjita Minj pounced on the rebound and tapped it in for the equaliser in the 38th minute.

SPSB showed more intent in the fourth quarter but SSB defended well to push the match into the shoot-out.

Manisha, Preeti and Kanika Raj converted for SSB and Manisha Dhawal for SPSB.

Both teams have qualified for next year’s A division championship.

Earlier, UCO Bank WHA hammered Bengaluru 10-0 to take the third place. Priya struck four goals, including a hat-trick, while Pooja and Chanchal struck a brace each.

330,2020/02/02,ARDSI founder Dr. Jacob Roy dead,"Founder of Alzheimer’s and Related Disorders Society of India (ARDSI) Jacob Roy Kuriakose, 68, died here in a private hospital on Sunday.

A paediatrician by profession, Dr. Kuriakose turned to take on the lead to set up a facility for caring for the people afflicted by Alzhiemer’s disease way back in 1992, when the disease was hardly known. It was a personal traumatic experience of caring for his father that led him to found a society that would understand and care for the disease.

With head office at Kunnamkulam, he nurtured it into a national-level organisation with 20 registered chapters across the country. The organisation, which started to create awareness on the disease also took up research to study the disease while struggling to get the attention of the powers that be to facilitate their work. The country’s first dementia day care at Kunnamkulam as well as a full-time dementia care home at Ernakulam were the result of years of struggle to make the policy makers aware about the disease and the need for care.

The Tropical Health Foundation of India was another NGO that he founded. He was a senior consultant at Malankara Medical Mission Hospital, Kunnamkulam.

In 2011, he was elected the chairman of Alzhiemer’s Disease International, the first Asian to hold the post.

Dr. Kuriakose was awarded the Vayoshreshtha Samman by the Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment for Institution of knowledge Dissemination category.

331,2020/02/02,Rural police to keep a ‘thousand eyes’ open,"The District Rural Police are gearing up to bring its entire jurisdictional area under round-the-clock monitoring with the help of high-resolution CCTV cameras for better maintenance of law and order through a novel project named Thousand Eyes.

The project, conceived as a public-private partnership initiative, aims at a centralised monitoring system through a network of CCTVs at the command and control room at the district police headquarters. Besides, monitoring will be facilitated at sub-divisional police offices and local police stations.

“The project will be implemented in two phases as part of introducing smart policing within the rural police limits. Initially, maximum number of CCTVs will be mounted at all public spaces under all local police station limits with public participation. Station House Officers [SHOs] have been given directions in this regard,” a release issued here on Friday quoted District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik as saying.

SHOs have also been asked to ensure that CCTVs installed earlier are still working. They have been told to report the steps taken in connection with the project at the crime conference to be held at the district police headquarters.

Sub divisional officers have been asked to solicit support under the corporate social responsibility initiatives of public and private sector companies and multinational corporations for mounting more CCTVs in areas where they are missing in the second phase.

The District Special Branch DySP will be the nodal officer for the project. The system is expected to come in handy for better traffic management, monitoring dharnas, and keeping a close eye on public spaces like major junctions and autorickshaw and bus stands frequented by women and children.

CCTV coverage is also expected to help in VIP security, crowd management, real-time coordination between various departments, monitoring strangers found under suspicious circumstances during night, and evidence collection from crime scenes.

332,2020/02/02,Middle income group hails tax slab revision,"Biju Puthuvally had been glued to the television right from the time when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman began presenting the Budget on Saturday morning.

An IT professional, he was eagerly waiting for her speech on personal income tax slabs. She did not disappoint him as she went on to announce the reduced tax rates. Biju was among the many middle-class taxpayers in the city who had expected a cut in personal income tax rates.

“The new slabs are welcome as they will bring more money into the hands of the individual. However, there will be confusion on the option being given to the taxpayer on whether to switch to the new tax regime or stick with the old one. It would have been good if the Minister had enabled tax cuts without foregoing exemptions and deductions,” he said.

Mr. Puthuvally was referring to her proposal that the new tax regime would be optional, and taxpayers would be given the choice to either remain in the old regime with exemptions and deductions or opt for the new reduced tax rate without exemptions.

Insurance cover

Dr. Premila Harimohan, a specialist in child development, was all praise for the Budget proposal to raise the limit of insurance cover in case of bank failure on deposits to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh. “This will be beneficial, especially for the elderly as a safe cover for their deposits. But I am anxious about the recommendation on selling a part of the Government holding in Life Insurance Corporation through an initial public offering,” she said.

Geevarghese Oommen, a senior manager with an automobile company, said a middle-income taxpayer could not have asked for more going by the considerable cuts in personal income tax slabs. “The tax reduction will be of immense help for people having an annual income of ₹5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh as they will now have to pay a reduced tax of 10%, and those in the income range between ₹7.5 lakh and ₹10 lakh need to pay only 15% from the earlier 20%,” he added. On the option given to taxpayers to choose between the existing income tax regime and a new one, Sreekumar Menon, a chartered accountant, said individuals should make their own calculations. “If you are a young person and not really worried about a life insurance policy, you need not take a life insurance to meet the ₹1.5-lakh exemption limit and can opt for the new regime,” he said.

B. Ajith Kumar, marketing manger, Traco Cables, said the reduction in income tax rates would help the salaried class to increase their spending. “The existing tax slabs are a huge burden. The new slabs will improve the ease of living of the salaried class,” he observed.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/middle-income-group-hails-tax-slab-revision/article30716970.ece

People who donated their eyes and other organs were real heroes because they never expected anything for their service, said N. Venkatesh Prajna, Ophthalmology Director, Aravind Eye Hospitals.

He was addressing a group of volunteers who had pledged to donate their eyes as part of an event held by Madurai Public Relation Officers Federation on Saturday.

Dr. Prajna said he was appreciative of the well-educated youth of Tamil Nadu who were willing to donate their organs. “Until five years ago, Tamil Nadu was nowhere close to being on top with respect to eye donation. We used to get eyes from Sri Lanka as it is common practice of Buddhists to donate their eyes. With help from non-governmental organisations, awareness and education, the government was able to take this critical step forward and have more families engaged in this service,” he said.

He said recipients of eyes were usually from low socio-economic backgrounds and feared paying heavy medical bills. “Corneal ulcer, a common phenomenon among agricultural labourers, happens when dust settles in the eye. The infection never heals and one must undergo a corneal replacement. These labourers usually cannot afford to pay huge amounts for operations. Those who donate their eyes do service to the poorest,” he said. He encouraged them to donate other organs too.

People should understand the ‘designs’ of Bharatiya Janata Party in promoting its Hindutva “divisive” politics that is based on dividing people on religious lines, said former Minister, Thangam Thennarasu.

Inaugurating a signature campaign organised by the Secular Progressive Alliance at Kariyapatti, the Tiruchuli MLA said that the BJP had failed the country on economic front.

“It is always keeping the people on tenterhooks so that they do not think about its failure on all poll promises. Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is one of the tools to divert people’s attention,” he said.

He clarified that CAA was not just anti-Muslim, but would discriminate people from other communities too. “It is against the very democratic fabric of the country,” he said.

Recalling that the Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman relating Goddess Saraswathi to Indus Valley Civilization during her budget speech, he said it was also an attempt to further Hindutva ideology. Democratic forces should get united to stop this, he said.

Another party MLA K.K.S.S.R. Ramachandran participated in a similar meeting at Aruppukottai and Sattur.

347,2020/02/02,Winged wonders throng sanctuaries in Ramanathapuram,"Ramanathapuram

Flocks of open-billed storks, herons and egrets were sighted nesting on the karuvelam thickets inside the five bird sanctuaries of Chitrangudi, Kanjirankal, Therthangal, Sakkarakottai and Melaselvanoor bird sanctuaries by bird watchers.

Thanks to the bountiful monsoon that the tanks in both these sanctuaries are brimming with water and the trees are teeming with bird life.

After almost three years, the birds have returned in large flocks. These sanctuaries in the inland part of the district are home to hundreds of species of birds that visit them seasonally.

“The birds started arriving in November as the climatic conditions were favourable this time and currently, the third set of nesting is on. Usually the tanks in the sanctuaries remain dry for several years and it’s refreshing to see them filled with water. The birds have also extended their stay this time and their presence may continue till April,” says Raveendran Natarajan, a birder from Madurai, who visited the sanctuaries ahead of the annual census in February.

“The annual bird census is scheduled in the second week of the month and we have invited 15 birders from across the State. In 2015, about 13,000 birds were sighted in the sanctuaries of which about 5,400 birds were seen in Therthangal alone. This year, we expect the numbers to be more than 50,000 and the species count may also go up,” says S. Sathish, Forest Range Officer, Ramanathapuram range.

“The forest department also spent about ₹30 lakh to desilt the tanks inside the sanctuaries ahead of the monsoon, because of which there’s ample water. Based on the recommendation of environmentalists and experts, we have proposed to declare the big tank as a bird sanctuary,” he adds.

The birds that get attracted to Therthangal and Melaselvanoor include both resident and seasonal migrants. The majority of them are water birds such as greater egret, cattle egret and little egret, pelicans, cormorant, darter, little grebe and a variety of herons, including pond heron, night heron and purple heron and water hens. The variety of ducks that visit included the comb duck and spot billed duck while there are also regional migrants such as Indian pita and babblers.

“We also sighted a couple of raptors or hunting birds, such as shrike, common kestrel, booted eagle, serpent eagle and brahminy kites. The number of birds shore birds in pockets like Arichalmunai, Valinokkam and other parts of the Gulf of Mannar marine biosphere reserve are also encouraging this year,” says Mr. Raveendran.

The presence of flamingoes in Arichalmunai and Dhanushkodi has been attracting a large number of tourists and the other shore birds sighted by birders include brown headed gull, black headed gull, whiskered tern, gull billed tern, greater crested tern and Caspian tern.

However, birders express concern over the increased inflow of tourists to Arichalmunai that may affect bird life and biodiversity. Tourism should be regulated and disposal of wastes generated by the visitors should also be done properly. Plastics should be banned from being brought into the eco-sensitive coastal zone, they say.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/43qn3g/article30719776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA03RMD-BIRDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/winged-wonders-throng-sanctuaries-in-ramanathapuram/article30719777.ece
348,2020/02/02,Employees’ unions oppose LIC disinvestment plan,"Opposing the announcement to disinvest Life Insurance Corporation of India, members of All India Insurance Employees Association have threatened to intensify their agitation and drum up support from the public to stall the Centre’s move.

Terming the LIC an ‘Amudha Surabhi’ of Indian economy, the Association members said the LIC’s contribution to the 11th Five Year Plan (2012-17) was a whopping ₹14.23 lakh crore. In the 12th Five Year Plan, the Corporation had already given ₹7.01 lakh crore to the Centre in the first two years. On an average, the LIC’s annual contribution had risen from ₹2.84 lakh crore in the 11th Five Year Plan to ₹3.50 lakh crore in the 12th Five Year Plan.

The LIC’s assets stood at ₹32 lakh crore. The Corporation had invested in railways, national highways, port development, electricity, waterbodies and drinking water projects. The LIC had also invested in many government bonds, the value of which stood at ₹28.84 lakh crore. Across the country, it had close to 12 lakh agents and policies to cover people from all walks of life.

At a time when the Centre was moving fast towards closing the PSUs and justified its decisions to privatise them, the LIC was nowhere in the picture as it was no match to private players in insurance sector.

The Association members on Saturday held a demonstration in the city, where the speakers said in the last fiscal alone, the LIC had given a dividend cheque for ₹2,611 crore to the Centre.

That the Corporation, which was started with a capital of ₹5 crore in 1956, never needed government’s assistance till date was a proof of its administrative abilities. The announcement in this Budget by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had come as a big blow to millions of people across the country, they said.

The government should withdraw its announcement, failing which the employees would have to intensify their stir against the government, said Association general secretary N.P. Ramesh Kannan.

The Association members criticised the entry of foreign players in insurance sector and their exit after making good of their capital in a decade. Armed with 40 crore policy holders, the LIC had the commitment of security and safety, they noted.

As a mark of protest, members of all employees’ unions across the country would abstain from work for an hour on Monday, Mr. Ramesh Kannan said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/employees-unions-oppose-lic-disinvestment-plan-madurai/article30719713.ece

351,2020/02/02,Ask Us: On investments,"Q. My mother retired this year and I want to invest her money in a microfinance institution (MFI). But before doing that, I need some clarification. In Manipur, there are some MFIs that offer an interest rate of about 3% per month on fixed deposits for three years. But I am a little sceptical about this very high interest rate. I want to know whether there are any banks or MFIs that offer rates that are this high and whether it is legal for them to do this?

Ningthemcha Ranjan Mangang

A. It is indeed creditable of you to not get taken in by the high interest rate offered by this entity and to check on the credentials of the microfinance firm offering them. Your suspicions are quite right. The MFI you mention is unlikely to be a deposit-taking entity authorised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). For one, in India, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are barred from accepting public deposits unless they are specifically authorised by the RBI. The list of NBFCs authorised to accept public deposits is available on the RBI website and you can run a check on this list. Two, NBFCs, which are allowed by RBI to accept deposits, cannot offer interest rates above 12.5% per annum by law. They also cannot offer deposits for periods less than 12 months or more than 60 months. As the MFI you mention is offering exceptional rates of 3% a month (over 36% a year), it is clearly violating the RBI rules. In fact, it is quite likely that the MFI you’re dealing with is not even registered. You can run a check on the RBI site for the list of MFIs that are registered and authorised to operate by the regulator. Investing with an unregulated entity for high interest rates is a highly risky proposition as your principal would be at risk of default.

If your mom is a senior citizen, the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme offered by India Post, offering an interest rate of 8.6% per annum, is currently the best bet. The scheme carries a five-year lock-in period and accepts up to ₹15 lakh per individual. You can also consider the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana from LIC which offers a guaranteed pension payout for 10 years at an effective return of about 8% per annum. These schemes are sovereign guaranteed with a minimal risk to your mom’s capital.

Q. I’m 24 years old and work in Bengaluru with a monthly income of ₹20,000. Of this, about ₹10,000 goes towards my expenses and repayment of my educational loan with the remaining amount saved every month. Kindly guide me on how to invest wisely for my future. Given the current scenario, my circle of friends tells me not to go in for stocks or bank deposits. So, what should I do?

Suriyaa A. G.

A. Where you should invest this money will depend on what you want to save for. If you have goals (such as a higher degree, marriage or a car purchase) coming up within the next 6-7 years, then your savings should go into debt or hybrid investments and not stock market investments or equity mutual funds. The latter can be quite risky to invest in for shorter time frames because a sudden market fall can saddle you with a capital loss.

But if you are looking to save towards long-term goals such as retirement, which are more than 6-7 years away, then you can consider investing in Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) of equity mutual funds that are carefully selected for their 10-year track record. Before you start on equity investments or SIPs, it is best that you read and understand more about them.

You can make an immediate start on fixed income investments. You should have about nine months’ worth of expenses (₹90,000) in a bank fixed deposit towards emergencies such as a loss of job or career break. Bank fixed deposits and recurring deposits are quite safe provided you go with leading scheduled commercial banks and avoid co-operative banks. Sound banks currently offer interest rates of 6-7.5% on their FDs. Banks or entities, that promise higher rates, carry higher risks. Given that these rates can rise, stick to one-year deposits. Do open a Public Provident Fund account with a post office or a leading bank that can help you accumulate retirement savings. You can invest up to ₹1.5 lakh a year in PPF. If you have dependants, get pure term life insurance that can take care of their needs in your absence.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ask-us-on-investments/article30719307.ece

353,2020/02/02,Centre rejects Finance Commission’s recommendations for special grants to States,"The Centre has pushed back on the 15th Finance Commission’s recommendation to give special grants worth ₹6,764 crore to States in 2020-21 to ensure that no State receives less than the previous year.

This was one of the few recommendations of the Commission that the Centre did not accept in its action taken report which was tabled in Parliament on Saturday and made public on Sunday.

It also accepted recommendations for grants to local bodies, disaster-related grants and sectoral grants.

However, the Centre asked the Commission to reconsider the recommendation for special grants “as it introduces a new principle.” These grants were suggested to ensure that in 2020-21, “no State receives in absolute terms less than what it received in 2019-20 on account of tax devolution and revenue deficit grants.”

354,2020/02/02,Home may be where the money is,"Travel and being away from home are two impediments to a woman’s job and career growth. Due to the need to stay at home, many often opt out of nine-to-five employment; they often find ways to use their skills and earn while working from home.

While any earning without going to work is viewed as good, women must look at it critically from the point of view of their larger financial goals and consider critical factors to make the most of their time.

Flexible employment

One good option, if it works out, is to negotiate an arrangement with the employers to continue your existing job from home. There are three key aspects you must focus on.

One, negotiate with confidence on the salary and responsibilities, as it is common for corporates to reduce salary or assign non-critical roles to those who are not regular at the office. This can be detrimental in the long-term and you must clearly articulate your strengths and what you can contribute in order to ensure your earnings and career prospects are not compromised.

Two, you must invest in a proper working environment in your house. For example, reliable high-speed Internet, power back-up and a space without interruptions are required to get the work done. If you must pay for help around the house, it must be done to ensure you can focus on work. These expenses will pay dividends, as your career grows uninterrupted.

Three, you must not lose focus on the long-term. For instance, ask if this arrangement is a sustainable option or not, given the nature of the job or the employer.

Think about career options if it may only work as a stopgap. You must also invest regularly to build a corpus while you work so that you can explore career change options.

Freelance work

Working on assignments, rather than be on payroll, is a popular option to consider. While there are many advantages, you must also plan for the financial challenges.

One, you must be clear on how to price your work. For instance, if your monthly salary was ₹80,000, the hourly rate was ₹500 (40 hours per week) and you must charge 2-3 times this amount and multiply by the estimated number of hours for an assignment.

The premium covers at least three things — intermittent nature of work, overheads such as business development and discussion hours and scope extension that would increase the hours.

Two, as your income will vary monthly, it is important to plan and invest regularly. You can consider doing a SIP for a minimum amount you would surely earn and make one-time investments whenever earnings are higher.

Selling products

Home-based item sales — such as gems, art or home décor items — is another way to earn. A common issue with this line of business is the lack of financial and accounting knowledge.

For instance, you may often find that revenue and profit are used interchangeably without clear understanding. Say you sell ₹100 worth of products that cost you ₹90. You need to factor in overheads such as marketing or ads (online such as on Facebook), costs for damage or returns and any expenses such as a webpage before you arrive at the profit.

Cashflow issues (due to long receivables) is another aspect that you must plan your finances for. Also, one cost that is not factored in is the time value of the person doing the business. You must track the hours you spend and realistically project how much the business can scale, to weigh if there may be better things you can do with your time.

Providing service

You can also use your skills and experience to offer services from home; for example, art or music lessons, coaching for exams, academic subject teaching, tax, legal or financial consulting and content work such as blogs, technical work such as cloud services support or some such options.

These services are typically better defined, and it is easier to fix your fee. There may be some overheads such as a good phone/Internet connection and a space to offer the service. However, you are likely to have repeat customers with less need for networking and marketing. Your monthly earnings are also somewhat predictable.

In this case, you must look at ways to maximise your earning potential. For example, besides in-person sessions, you can reach more people through online tools such as Zoom or Skype. There are also platforms that you can be a part of to get more clients. By also standardising your work, you can save time by doing it once and reusing, to earn more within the limited hours.

355,2020/02/02,Moneywise: Four pitfalls in home loan down payment,"For most people, buying a dream home will probably be their single largest big-ticket expense. With the Reserve Bank of India capping home loan LTV (loan to value) ratio at 90%, 80% and 75% for home loan amounts of up to ₹30 lakh, ₹30-75 lakh and above ₹75 lakh respectively, even the down payment requirement for home loans goes up to several lakhs.

The size of the down payment money, coupled with the urge to buy their dream home, force many to make financial mistakes, which can have an adverse impact on their financial health in the long term.

Here are some of the common mistakes that borrowers make while sourcing home loan down payment money.

Availing personal loans

Home loan lenders usually prefer to lend to those with fixed obligation to income ratio (FOIR) of 50-60%. This ratio denotes the proportion of the loan applicant’s monthly income used for servicing his fixed monthly obligations such as his existing EMIs, insurance premiums and the EMI for his new home loan.

If the home loan applicant avails a personal loan to finance his down payment component, the new EMI of his personal loan will further reduce his FOIR, thereby reducing his overall home loan eligibility. Additionally, applying for personal loans with multiple lenders can also reduce the credit score as any new loan application is reported to the credit bureaus who, in turn, reduce the credit score by a few points. A reduced credit score will further bring down his home loan eligibility.

Using emergency fund

This fund refers to the part of your savings set aside for dealing with unforeseen expenses and meeting unavoidable expenses in case of loss of income arising out of illnesses, job loss and disability. The size of this fund should cover the mandatory expenses of at least six months, such as your existing EMIs, daily household expenses, utility bills, children’s school fee, insurance premiums, medical expenditure, etc.

If you use up your emergency fund for making the down payment, you will be forced to redeem your investments earmarked for other crucial financial goals or avail loans at high interest rates.

Using retirement corpus

The increasing number of nuclear families and absence of universal old-age social security have increased the importance of having adequate post-retirement corpus. Increasing healthcare costs and rising life expectancy have also increased the risk of running out of retirement savings. However, the long time horizon available for creating retirement corpus leads most to ignore its importance. As a result, many who regularly save for their retirement corpus through regular contributions to EPF, PPF or even mutual fund end up redeeming funds from their retirement corpus. The flip side of doing so is that restarting your contribution from scratch or at depleted levels would take longer to create adequate corpus.

For example, if a 25-year old investor starts an SIP of ₹10,000 per month in an equity fund generating an annualised return of 12% p.a., he will have a corpus of ₹6.43 crore on turning 60. However, if he withdraws the entire corpus after six years of investing for making his home loan down payment, he will redeem ₹10.50 lakh assuming the same rate of return. If he starts investing in the same fund for re-building his retirement corpus immediately after making his home loan down payment, he will have a retirement corpus of just ₹3.09 crore on turning 60. The new corpus will be half of what he would have built, had he stayed invested.

Redeeming children’s education corpus

The rising cost of higher education is worrying for both parents and children. For most parents, availing an education loan has become the only source to finance their wards’ higher education cost. On the other hand, higher loan amounts can leave children with a sizeable debt burden to service which, in turn, can adversely impact their savings during the initial stages of their career.

The best way to avoid such high-cost debt is to start building your children’s education fund early on. Start early with regular investment at periodic intervals, preferably through SIPs. This will allow you to create the target corpus at much lower instalments. However, the same issue of long investment horizon can entice many to redeem their children’s education corpus for arranging down payment money. As explained in the case of retirement corpus, restarting your contribution from scratch or at depleted levels would mean it would take longer to achieve the target corpus for your children’s education.

Conclusion

Instead of availing a personal loan or redeeming your emergency fund or other investments for crucial life goals, start saving early for home loan down payment by regularly investing in mutual funds through SIP. Use an online SIP calculator to find out the monthly investments required to create your home loan down payment corpus. Invest in ultra-short and/or other short-term debt funds if you wish to create substantial corpus within three years. Invest in balanced advantage funds if you wish to create this corpus within 3-5 years. Opt for large cap or multi-cap equity funds if you have over five years to create the corpus.
