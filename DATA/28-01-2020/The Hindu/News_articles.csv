0,2020/01/28,Badminton | Warriors blow away Rockets,"A lacklustre performance from P. Kashyap against Wong Wing Ki Vincent allowed Awadhe Warriors to take an unassailable 4-0 lead against Mumbai Rockets in their PBL match here on Tuesday.

The onus was on Kashyap to deliver in his team’s Trump match, but he was subdued throughout the match and couldn’t find his rhythm.

Ajay Jayaram defeated South Korea’s Lee Dong Keun to widen the margin to 4-0.

Jayaram, playing his first match, took his time to settle down before registering a 12-15, 15-6, 15-7 win.

Earlier, Kim Sa Rang and Pia Zebadiah overcame a spirited resistance from Ko Sung Hyun and Christinna Pederson to give Rockets the early lead.

Beiwen Zhang, displaying her wide repertoire of shots, levelled the scores with a 15-3, 15-4 demolition of Kuhoo Garg in Warriors’ Trump.

Kashyap and Vincent engaged each other in rallies, waiting for the slightest opening to pounce on.

As the match wore on, it was Vincent who gained the upper hand.

Kashyap continued to make errors and crumbled consistently in the rallies. Vincent, the World No. 41, collapsed on the ground in delight after the upset.

The results:

Awadhe Warriors 4 Mumbai Rockets 0 (Ko Sung Hyun & Christinna Pedersen lost to Kim Sa Rang & Pia Zebadiah 9-15, 14-15; (T) Beiwen Zhang bt Kuhoo Garg 15-3, 15-4; Wong Wing Ki Vincent bt (T) P.

1,2020/01/28,"Table tennis | Sharath, Sathiyan in cruise mode","The late arrival of Petroleum team, comprising members of the Indian team, and the obvious compulsion of the Table Tennis Federation of India to accommodate it, sent the pre-quarterfinal schedule for a toss in the National table tennis championship here on Tuesday.

With the competition already a day-and-a-half old, the squad consisting of G. Sathiyan, Sharath Kamal, Harmeet Desai, Sanil Shetty and Manav Thakkar were required to play league matches virtually in succession against Punjab, Uttarakhand and Assam.

The defending champion won all matches with identical 3-0 margins.

Time to recover

Thereafter, the pre-quarterfinals could not be started immediately since the members of the Petroleum team needed some time to rest and recover.

This led to a delay of over 90 minutes before the pre-quarterfinal pairings could be made. Petroleum drew Rajasthan, second seed Gujarat got ready to play TTTA (from Tamil Nadu), third seed Delhi prepared for Assam and host Telangana, which occupied the spot meant for fourth seed Uttar Pradesh, ran into Maharashtra-B.

The other pairings were Mizoram-Maharashtra-A, Railways-TNTTA, Kerala-Bengal-A and Haryana-UP.

The duo of Sathiyan and Sharath won the outings against Assam in straight sets.

Sathiyan pointed to the grainy tables that assisted the spinning ball to gain move revolutions, thereby making those who play more regularly on the World Tour to make the necessary adjustments.

Challenging

“Here, the ball comes much faster and challenges a player more. So it is always good to be part of the National championship which really tests your skills in different ways. For me, playing in the Nationals means a lot and I want to win it,” said Sathiyan who narrowly lost last year’s final to Sharath and missed a golden opportunity to win his maiden National title.

Sharath, in line for a 10th National title, was careful not to sound too upbeat. “You know, every year it gets tougher and I need to take one match at a time and see how my body is holding. But I am quiet happy with the way I am playing. Need to rest well ahead of the singles and then take it as it comes.”

In the women’s section, where last year’s singles runner-up Krittwika Sinha Roy lost to Chennai-girl Selenadeepthi Selvakumar in five games in Petroleum’s 3-1 win over TTTA, seven of the eight seeds duly made it to the round of 16.

Seventh seed Gujarat was ousted after finishing third Group G behind Haryana and Assam.

2,2020/01/28,Pankaj Advani is National billiards champion,"Pankaj Advani claimed yet another senior National billiards championship title with a 5-2 win over Sourav Kothari here on Tuesday.

After losing the first frame in the best-of-9 150-up tie, Advani bounced back with breaks of 95 and 151 to go 2-1 up. The fourth frame was snatched by Sourav with the aid of a 135 break to level the match 2-all.

Advani then raised his game to the next level, winning the next three frames with breaks of 135, 94 and 109. This is Advani’s 33rd National title and 10th in the senior category.

In the semifinals, Advani blanked Gujarat’s Dhvaj Haria 5-0. The match included four 150 breaks and an 81.

“I’m glad to win this title despite improved standards in our country’s level of the 3-ball game,” Advani said. “I’d like to dedicate this title to Jyotsna Savur, the wife of my coach Arvind Savur, who passed away recently. She was like a mother to me and I pray her soul rests in peace. This one is for you Aunty Jyotsna!”

The 23-time World champion will begin his National snooker campaign at the same venue, once the qualifying rounds are over.

4,2020/01/28,FBI probe helicopter crash that killed Kobe Bryant,"Federal investigators on Monday sifted through the wreckage of the helicopter crash near Los Angeles that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight other people, hoping to find clues to what caused the accident that stunned the world.

Bryant, 41, was travelling Sunday with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other passengers and crew when the Sikorsky S-76 slammed into a rugged hillside in thick fog in Calabasas, northwest of LA. There were no survivors.

A five-time NBA champion for his only team, the LA Lakers, and a double Olympic gold medalist, Bryant is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketballers in history. He was travelling on his private helicopter from Orange County, where he lived, to his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks.

The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are leading the investigation into the crash. Kurt Keetz, a pilot who said he flew Bryant from 2014 to 2016, told the Los Angeles Times he suspects the crash was most likely caused by bad weather rather than engine trouble.

“The likelihood of a catastrophic twin-engine failure on that aircraft — it just doesn't happen,” he said. The fog was heavy enough on Sunday that the Los Angeles Police Department grounded its helicopters until the afternoon, spokesman Josh Rubeinstein told AFP.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department also had no helicopters flying Sunday morning, Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters. The Washington Post, citing air traffic control audio recordings, reported however that Bryant’s pilot had received clearance to fly. Witnesses told local media the helicopter appeared to be flying very low and seemed to struggle before it slammed into a hillside.

Dozens of firefighters and paramedics battled across hilly terrain to reach the flaming wreckage but found no survivors.

‘Logistical nightmare’

Sheriff Villanueva said the recovery effort would probably take days because the steep terrain at the crash site made it a “logistical nightmare.”

Apart from Bryant and his daughter Gianna, the other passengers on the flight included baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife Keri and their daughter Alyssa, who played basketball at the same club as Gianna. Christina Mauser, an assistant coach of the Mamba girls’ basketball team, was also killed along with Sarah and Payton Chester, a mother and daughter.

News of the crash reverberated across the globe and hundreds gathered at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, where Bryant wowed fans for 20 years, placing flowers, candles and messages for their fallen hero. “He meant hard work... and he was just such a good person,” said Anthony Jackson, 62, who carried a collage of photos of Bryant.

Tributes have also flooded in from former U.S. presidents, popstars and athletes from different sports, a sign of how the man known as the “Black Mamba” had transcended basketball. “Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,” Barack Obama tweeted.

Bryant’s career began in 1996, straight out of high school. On top of his NBA championship wins, he helped the U.S. squad of allstars to Olympic titles in 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London.

Fairytale farewell

Bryant bowed out of the NBA in 2016, scoring 60 points in a fairytale farewell appearance at the Staples Center. The son of former NBA player Joe “Jellybean” Bryant, the Lakers legend was born in Philadelphia while his father played for the 76ers.

The elder Bryant played from 1984 to 1991 in Italy, giving young Kobe a global worldview as he grew up dreaming of following his dad into the NBA. He would eventually join the ranks of professionals at the age of 17, jumping directly into the NBA, only the sixth player to make such a leap.

At 18, Bryant became, at the time, the youngest player or starter in an NBA game and the youngest winner of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. With Bryant alongside Shaquille O’Neal, the Lakers captured three straight NBA crowns from 2000-2002, returning the team to glory days unseen since 1988.

Bryant’s career was almost derailed in 2003 when he was arrested in Colorado over a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee where Bryant was staying ahead of knee surgery. He admitted to adultery but denied an accusation of rape and the case was dropped in 2004 after the accuser refused to testify.

A separate civil suit was settled under terms kept private. After his playing career, Bryant branched out into the entertainment industry. In 2018, he won an Oscar for his animated short film Dear Basketball, a love letter to the sport which brought him fame and fortune.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/news/m5dqlc/article30670349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBITBRYANTTHNAK-28jan,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/fbi-probe-helicopter-crash-that-killed-kobe-bryant/article30670346.ece

7,2020/01/28,"Australian Open 2020 | Federer saves seven match points, beats Sandgren to land a semifinal spot","Roger Federer was not going to go gently, of course, no matter how daunting the number of match points — his opponent accumulated seven! — no matter how achy his 38-year-old legs, no matter how slow his serves, no matter how off-target his groundstrokes.

Federer still plays for the love of these stages and circumstances. Still yearns for more trophies, too. Down to his very last gasp, time and again, against someone a decade younger, 100th-ranked Tennys Sandgren of the United States, Federer somehow pulled off a memorable comeback to reach the Australian Open semifinals for the 15th time.

Despite all sorts of signs he was not quite himself for much of the match, Federer beat the biceps-baring, hard-hitting, court-covering Sandgren 6-3, 2-6, 2-6, 7-6 (8), 6-3 on Tuesday in a rollicking quarterfinal that appeared to be over long before it truly was.

“As the match went on, I started to feel better again and all the pressure went away,” 20-time Grand Slam champion Federer said afterward, mentioning that his groin muscle was bothering him. “I don’t deserve this one, but I’m standing here and I’m obviously very, very happy.”

Federer vs. Sandgren was dramatic as can be. Federer was involved in a dispute with the chair umpire over cursing. Left the court for a medical timeout early in the third set, then was visited by a trainer later for a right leg massage.

And, above all, found himself in a tense tussle with Sandgren, a 28-year-old from Tennessee who’s never been a major semifinalist and was trying to become the lowest-ranked man in the Australian Open’s final four since Patrick McEnroe — John’s younger brother — was No. 114 in 1991.

Oh, how close Sandgren came to the monumental upset. And imagine the heartbreak for someone who toiled for years on lower-level tours then was thrilled just to take this stage against Federer.

After rolling through the second and third sets as Federer’s serves dropped from an average of 112 mph to 105 mph and his unforced errors totaled 30, Sandgren led 5-4 in the fourth set. With Federer serving, Sandgren had a trio of opportunities to end things and complete a career-defining victory. On the first, Sandgren dumped a backhand into the net. On the second, he pushed a forehand wide. On the third, another forehand found the net.

On they went to a tiebreaker, which included the bizarre sight of a ballkid running into Sandgren’s right calf at the 3-all changeover. Didn’t seem to bother the guy, though, because he grabbed the next three points to put himself a single point from winning.

But Sandgren failed to close the deal at 6-3 ... or at 6-4 ... or at 6-5 ... or at 7-6.

“Got to get lucky sometimes, I’ll tell you that,” Federer said. “Because in those seven match points, you’re not under control.”

On Federer’s own second chance to take that set and force a fifth, Sandgren hit a ball that landed near the baseline. Federer thought it might be out — he turned to look at a line judge for a call that never came — yet barely flicked it back in a defensive manner, and Sandgren’s overhead smash went long.

Federer wagged his right index finger overhead — the universal sign for “I’m No. 1!” — and was on the right path. He ended the victory with a service winner at 119 mph, a little more than an hour after first staring down defeat.

Federer has won six Australian Opens and never lost to anyone ranked worse than 54th. But Sandgren, whose career tour-level record is under .500, played superbly — he produced edges of 27-5 in aces, 73-44 in total winners — for all but the seven most crucial points.

Other than the first set and the fifth, Federer’s footwork was hardly perfect, the lower-body push he normally gets to add oomph to forehands and serves nonexistent.

At the U.S. Open last September, it was Federer’s upper back and neck that bothered him in a five-set quarterfinal loss to Grigor Dimitrov, who was ranked 78th at the time.

In this tournament, the No. 3-seeded Federer still hasn’t played anyone ranked better than No. 41 Filip Krajinovic, whom he beat in the second round. Federer was pushed to the brink in the third round by No. 47 John Millman, two points from defeat before coming back to claim a fifth-set tiebreaker. And in the fourth round, Federer dropped the opening set to No. 67 Marton Fucsovics.

9,2020/01/28,Australian open | Barty avenges Kvitova defeat to reach first semi-final,"Ashleigh Barty will play 14th-seeded American Sofia Kenin in the Australian Open semi-finals after the world number one defeated Petra Kvitova in straight sets on Tuesday.

The top seed and last remaining Australian in the tournament survived a tough opening set to beat the Czech seventh seed 7-6 (8/6), 6-2 and reach the semi-finals for the first time.

This was revenge for the 23-year-old Barty after two-time Wimbledon champion Kvitova beat her at the same stage last year in Melbourne.

But the down-to-earth Australian is a better player than 12 months ago, winning the French Open last year and hitting the top of the rankings for the first time.

""It's been absolutely incredible. I knew that I had to bring my best today against Petra, and that first set was crucial,"" said Barty.

Barty is attempting to become the first Australian woman since Chris O'Neil in 1978 win the women's title Down Under.

Kvitova, 29, who suffered severe injury to her left playing hand in a knife attack at her home in 2016, and Barty went toe-to-toe in a crucial seventh game of the first set.

In a game stretching to nearly 10 minutes, Barty fought off five break points to hold serve at Rod Laver Arena, to roars of approval.

In a tense encounter they went to the tie-break, but it was Kvitova who blinked, shanking a forehand long to give Barty the set in 69 high-quality minutes.

Barty, who once gave up tennis to play professional cricket, clenched her fist. Kvitova tossed her racquet into air.

Barty pulled away in the second set as Kvitova wilted in the Melbourne sun.

The Australian sealed the deal with her trademark minimum fuss, booking her spot in the last four with an ace.

Kenin 'super-excited'

Earlier Kenin, Coco Gauff's conqueror, reached her first Major semi-final as the American ended the historic run of Tunisian Ons Jabeur.

The Moscow-born 21-year-old, who defeated 15-year-old Gauff in the previous round, saw off the unseeded Jabeur 6-4, 6-4 and said that she was ""super-excited"".

""It was a tough match,"" said Kenin, who moved to New York as a baby with her family with just a few hundred dollars to their name.

Kenin said that holding her serve at 3-2 down in the second set, in a game that stretched to 10 minutes, was a turning point.

10,2020/01/28,"Hyderabad, geek out at Product Hunt’s new meetups","We have seen GeekNights, blockchain conclaves and gadget swag parties in the city, but the tech community is finally getting a taste of Product Hunt, a set of international and community-driven meetups where people get into the not-much-talked-about parts of the technology and product ecosystems. For example, the group can discuss affordable standing desk options, best personal finance apps, automation gadgets. The basic idea is to ‘discover your next favourite thing.’

Product Hunt was founded by San Francisco-based Ryan Hoover in 2014. The initiative has seen over 400 meetups hosted across the globe including New York, Austin, Tel Aviv, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Toronto, and Amsterdam.

Headed by techie Santosh Viswanathan, the Hyderabad conclave kicks off this evening at 6 pm at Collab House in Green Park Hotel, Begumpet. When he was in Austin, Texas for a Mozilla All Hands meetup, he got to know about Product Hunt from peers. “The first challenge I — as an Individual or an organisation — personally face when building a product is to increase the visibility of our product to the users, developers, co-creators and everyone in the ecosystem and to get feedback,” explains Santosh, “I found Product Hunt to be exciting and interesting that solves this particular problem to the core. I’ve been speaking at international conferences for a while now, but not ones specific to Product Hunt.. [after hearing about the global meetups, eventually] I thought ‘why don't we do one in Hyderabad?’ and that's how I'm hosting this!”

He adds that he is aware of Product Hunt meetups in Chennai and Bengaluru, but is unsure about who is running them.

Collab House founder Vineel Reddy is excited to host Product Hunt. “At Collab House we've been hosting meetups, workshops and programs with a focus on technology, design and arts, to bring together the community and enable collaborations. We're thrilled to host Product Hunt Hyderabad as the meetup brings together a community of technologists, startups and people interested in exploring and talk about cool new products.”

Vineel concludes, “Connecting with people online is great but there’s no replacement to meeting your future best friend, finding your next co-founder, or simply having an interesting conversation in real life. Product Hunt meetups are a fun way to hang out with other smart, enthusiastic people that love tech.”

11,2020/01/28,Worldwide sales of smartphones decline for first time since 2008,"Worldwide sales of smartphones to end users declined two per cent in 2019, the first time since 2008 that the global market for such phones experienced a decline, Gartner Inc said.

But they are on track to reach 1.57 billion units in 2020, an increase of three per cent year over year, the research and advisory company said.

“2019 was a challenging year for smartphone vendors, primarily due to oversupply in the high-end sector in mature markets and longer replacement cycles overall,” Research Vice President at Gartner, Annette Zimmermann said.

“However, in 2020, the market is expected to rebound with the introduction of 5G network coverage in more countries and as users who may have delayed their smartphone purchases until 2020 in expectation of price reductions begin buying again,” she was quoted as saying in a Gartner statement.

Gartner forecasts that sales of 5G mobile phones will total 221 million units in 2020 which will account for 12 per cent of overall mobile phone sales and more than double in 2021, to 489 million units.

“The commercialisation of 5G phones will accelerate in 2020. 5G phones costing under $300 have been announced, so sales growth of 5G phones is expected to exceed that of 4G phones over twelve months,” Zimmermann said.

Strong demand for 5G phones in general, together with expectations of Apple’s first 5G iPhone, will bolster demand for smartphones, particularly in Asia/Pacific and Greater China, according to Gartner.

In terms of smartphone sales, Greater China and emerging Asia/Pacific will maintain their number one and number two positions globally in 2020, with respective sales of 432.3 million and 376.8 million smartphones, it was stated.

“Smartphone sales will register growth in 2020 as the demand for mid-price smartphones rises in India,” said Senior Research Director at Gartner, Anshul Gupta.

“Premium features including improved camera, display at affordable price will remain key for growth in the Indian smartphone market in 2020,” he added.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/society/u2521c/article30410414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29SMPHONES2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/worldwide-sales-of-smartphones-decline-for-first-time-since-2008/article30674129.ece
12,2020/01/28,"Avast antivirus sold users data to Google, Microsoft: Report","In a sensational revelation, an investigation on Monday claimed that the popular Avast antivirus, installed on nearly 435 millions Windows, Mac and mobile devices globally, harvested users’ data via browser plugins and then sold it to third parties, including Microsoft and Google.

The joint investigation by Motherboard and PCMag that relied on leaked user data and other company documents found that “the sale of this data is both highly sensitive and is, in many cases, supposed to remain confidential between the company selling the data and the clients purchasing it.”

The leaked documents accessed for the investigation were from a subsidiary of the antivirus giant Avast, called Jumpshot.

The Avast antivirus programme was installed on a person’s computer which collected the data, and Jumpshot repackaged it into various different products which were sold to big companies.

“Potential clients include Google, Yelp, Microsoft, McKinsey, Pepsi, Sephora, Home Depot, Conde Nast, Intuit, and many others,” the report claimed.

In a statement, Avast said it has stopped providing browsing data collected by the extensions to Jumpshot.

Some clients even paid millions of dollars for products that include a so-called “All Clicks Feed”, which can track user behaviour, clicks, and movement across websites in detail.

In copies of contracts with Jumpshot clients, one marketing firm paid over $2 million for data access last year.

Avast offers a selection of free and paid-for antivirus and security tools, in both free and in paid-for formats.

According to the investigation, Avast also recorded “porn site visits that are anonymized, offered the date and time the user visited the sites, as well as search terms and viewed videos in some instances.”

Multiple Avast users told Motherboard they were not aware that Avast sold browsing data, raising questions about how informed that consent is.

13,2020/01/28,How Chinese tech firms are quietly flexing muscles in India,"From cops on duty to young lads in small-town India, Chinese short-video making app TikTok has become a rising phenomenon, owing to a strong local network while providing marketers with a platform to reach millions of untapped users.

TikTok has 700 million users globally, out of which over 200 million are now in India, and growing exponentially. Despite being pulled by the law enforcement agencies for vitiating the digital atmosphere in the country, TikTok has created its own fan following and US players like Facebook and its apps WhatsApp and Instagram are a worried lot.

Global market research firm Forrester estimates that short video ad spending for the key Asia Pacific markets of Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea is likely to hit $4.7 billion in 2019.

“TikTok’s success among non-Chinese consumers is partly due to its ability to adapt to domestic markets from a content and cultural point of view. In India, TikTok has its own local team that plans and monitors content specifically for younger demographics. This has attracted a high number of active users on its platform,” explains Meenakshi Tiwari, Forecast Analyst at Forrester.

Chinese B2B e-commerce platform Club Factory last week surpassed 100 million monthly active users (MAUs) in India -- mostly from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Telangana.

B2B ecommerce

According to Vincent Lou, Founder and CEO, Club Factory, the company managed to reduce delivery time by as much as 30% with average positive product rating going up by 40% in 2019. “Returns or product exchange on the platform have dropped by almost 25 per cent, said Lou.

As of December 2019, Club Factory’s registered local seller base stands close to 30,000.

The aim, like TikTok, is clear: create a niche space especially in small-town India and stay afloat.

According to Satish Meena, Senior Forecast Analyst with Forrester, round one of the Indian ecommerce battle went to Amazon and Flipkart but round two definitely belongs to the Chinese companies.

“Things are different when it comes to the Chinese way of doing business. They are competing to win new customers in India in the ecommerce space which are not yet on Amazon or Flipkart, by offering heavy discounts and selling cheap. Club Factory is exactly doing this and gaining users fast,” Meena told IANS.

“The upcoming battle will happen in the social ecommerce and content space in India and Chinese are too good at that, by offering different products at affordable prices and targeting tier II and III towns where they can easily sell such products,” Meena elaborated.

The challenge, however, is a seamless logistics chain for the cross-border ecommerce.

“Logistics is a big hurdle for them as these costs have to be low in order to make profits. Chinese ecommerce players like Club Factory, Shein and JollyC have created an initial buzz, but it is to be seen how serious they are and what value addition they would eventually bring to the country,” Meena noted.

In December, the government came down heavily on the Chinese cross-border e-commerce firms for using the “gift” route to export orders and avoid paying customs duty.

The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) banned import of goods under the “gift” route in a notification, saying these companies will now have to pay the duty, even on “gifts and samples” valued at under ₹5,000.

According to a latest report by the E-Commerce Council of India (TECI) and ChannelPlay, fueled by low data tariffs, affordable smartphones and growing internet usage, the size of the Indian e-commerce market is likely to reach $230 billion in a decade.

Another 40-50 crore shoppers are expected to come online in 10 years, joining the nearly 10 crore online shoppers in India.

Chinese ecommerce giants know this well that aspirational India is the next fertile ground for their growth and before US giants win them over, the Dragon has set the ball rolling.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/rckftn/article30315375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16MPSocial-medG396RI74V3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/how-china-quietly-flexing-its-muscles-in-india/article30672310.ece

15,2020/01/28,"Morning digest: Coronavirus death toll jumps to 106, Lok Sabha Speaker seeks to stall EU debate on CAA, and more","China on Tuesday reported 25 more deaths from a new viral disease as the U.S. government prepared to evacuate Americans from the city at the center of the outbreak. Authorities reported 24 deaths in Hubei province, where the virus first was detected in December, and one in Beijing, the Chinese capital.

No national total was immediately announced but with 81 deaths reported through Monday, that would make the toll at least 106.

Concerned by the European Parliament’s decision to discuss six resolutions on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, and the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has written to its President David Sassoli, “urging” him to reconsider the resolutions critical of India. “As members of the Inter Parliamentary Union, we should respect the sovereign processes of fellow legislatures, especially in democracies,” Mr. Birla wrote in the letter, adding that it was “inappropriate for one legislature to pass judgment on another.”

Senior BJP leader and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday alleged that the Shaheen Bagh protest in Delhi was “a textbook case of a few hundred people trying to suppress the silent majority”, offering a platform to the tukde tukde gang under the guise of opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). He said those trying to fragment India were getting cover at Shaheen Bagh, where the tricolours were being waved.

The Supreme Court on Monday asked the government to explain why a law meant to protect the transgender community requires a magistrate’s certificate as a prior condition for the State to even identify a transperson. A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued formal notice to the government on the petition filed by Swati Bidhan Baruah, an Assam-based advocate and transgender rights activist, who argued that the “right to self-identification forms part of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution”.

More than 600 members of eight extremist groups in Assam gave up arms at an official programme on January 23, but one of them — the National Liberation Front of Bengalis (NLFB) — has raised eyebrows. Reports quoting people in districts such as Baksa and Chirang in western Assam said many of the 301 surrendered members of the “little-known” NLFB were petty traders or minor craftsmen such as carpenters. This has led to questions regarding the so-called “surrender drama” and of the members of “equally obscure” outfits such as the National Santhal Liberation Army and the Adivashi Dragon Fighters who allegedly laid down arms.

The Union government on Monday invited bids for 100% stake sale of Air India (AI) and transfer of management control along with its complete share in two subsidiaries-low-cost international carrier Air India Express and ground-handling arm AISATS. The government has offered to hive off liabilities worth nearly ₹40,000 crore to sweeten the deal.

Hours after earmarking an aircraft on standby for an evacuation flight to Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, Air India officials called it off on Monday. They said the special sortie from Mumbai had been put on hold until further instructions from the government. Sounded out by the government, Air India pulled out a Boeing 747 for the sensitive operation. “The 423-seater double-decker jumbo aircraft will bring back, among others, students stranded in Wuhan,” an airline official said in Mumbai. The 12-member crew, rostered for a 5 p.m. departure, had been pulled out, he said. It was not clear whether a team of doctors would travel along.

China’s capital on Monday recorded its first death from a deadly coronavirus as it struggles to contain a rapidly spreading disease that has sparked global alarm, with countries scrambling to evacuate their citizens from the epicentre of the epidemic. The fatality in Beijing raises the death toll from the new virus to 82, with more than 2,700 people infected across the nation.

17,2020/01/28,Trump trial: support increasing within GOP for new witnesses,"As reports of U.S. President Donald Trump having told his former National Security Adviser John Bolton to hold assistance to Ukraine pending politically-charged investigations spread, pressure from within the GOP to call new witnesses intensified, with some GOP Senators publicly expressing their interest in hearing from Mr. Bolton and other new witnesses.

Mr. Trump’s defence team, however, side-stepped the Bolton issue as they defended their client in the Senate on Monday.

In a book manuscript, some details of which were reported by The New York Times on Sunday, Mr. Bolton had said that Mr. Trump asked him to continue freezing $391 in military aid to Ukraine pending Ukraine announcing investigations that were politically advantageous to Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in December on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. A Democrat run impeachment inquiry had found that Mr Trump conditioned the aid to Ukraine and a crucial White House meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenksy, on the Ukrainians announcing investigations into former Vice President Joseph Biden, the Democrat frontrunner for the White House and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma. Mr Trump had also, as per the inquiry’s findings, asked for a second investigation into an unfounded theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 U.S. elections.

“I think it’s increasingly likely that other Republicans will join those of us who think we should hear from John Bolton,” GOP Senator from Utah and former Presidential candidate Mitt Romney told reporters on Monday.

During lunch, GOP Senators had discussed at greater length the need to call Mr. Bolton and other witnesses, as per some media outlets.

“The reports about John Bolton’s book strengthen the case for witnesses and have prompted a number of conversations among my colleagues,” GOP Senator Susan Collins of Maine tweeted.

Along with Ms Collins and Mr Romney, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee are likely GOP senators who will want to hear from new witnesses.

Mr Trump’s defence team argued on Monday that Mr Trump had told others involved with the matter that there was no linkage between the aid to Ukraine and the announcement of an investigation. Mr. Trump’s lawyers Pam Bondi and Eric Herschmann also turned the focus on the Bidens calling into question the Bidens’ dealings in Ukraine. They argued that former U.S. President Barack Obama had abused his office by engaging in a quid pro quo with Dmitriy Medvedev, who was President of Russia at the time.

The prime-time (evening) slot as saved for high profile Harvard law professor and criminal defence attorney Alan Dershowitz, who argued that the president must have committed an actual crime for his impeachment to meet constitutionally mandated standards. Critics of this argument, such as Harvard Law Professor Nikolas Bowie argued in the New York Times on Monday that even if one agrees with Mr Dershowitz, the president has been accused of two crimes – abuse of office and obstruction of Congress.

18,2020/01/28,"Trump unveils West Asia plan, Palestinians protest","U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday proposed creation of a Palestinian state with capital in eastern Jerusalem, dependent on Palestinians taking steps to become self-governing, as part of a peace plan to end decades of conflict in the region.

Senior administration officials said that under Mr. Trump’s proposed West Asia peace plan, the U.S. will recognise Israeli settlements on the occupied West Bank.

In exchange, Israel would agree to accept a four-year freeze on new settlement activity while Palestinian statehood is negotiated.

“Today, Israel has taken a giant step toward peace,” Mr. Trump said as he announced the plan at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his side, saying he also sent a letter about it to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.

“This is a historic day,” Mr. Netanyahu said, comparing Mr. Trump’s peace plan to former President Harry Truman’s 1948 recognition of the state of Israel. “On this day, you became the first world leader to recognise Israel’s sovereignty over areas in Judea and Samaria that are vital to our security and central to our heritage,” he added, using the Biblical names for the West Bank.

Skepticism over deal

The absence of the Palestinians from Mr. Trump’s announcement is likely to fuel criticism that the plan tilts toward Israel.

U.S. officials said they were braced for initial Palestinian skepticism but hoped that over time they will agree to negotiate.

Mr. Trump has endorsed a proposed map outlining the two states, the officials said. The Palestinian state would be double the size of land that Palestinians currently control and would be connected by roads, bridges and tunnels, the official said.

Meanwhile, thousands of Palestinians demonstrated in Gaza and Israeli troops reinforced positions near a flashpoint site between the Palestinian city of Ramallah and the Jewish settlement of Beit El in the West Bank.

A Netanyahu spokesman said the Israeli leader would fly to Moscow on Wednesday to brief Russian President Vladimir Putin on the proposals. Palestinian leaders had said they were not invited to Washington, and that no plan could work without them.

On Monday Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas said he would not agree to any deal that did not secure a two-state solution. That formula, the basis for many years of frustrated international peace efforts, envisages Israel co-existing with a Palestinian state.

Hitting a rocky patch

Palestinians have refused to deal with the Trump administration in protest at such pro-Israeli policies as its moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, whose eastern half the Palestinians seek for a future capital.

The Trump administration in November reversed decades of U.S. policy when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington no longer regarded the settlements on West Bank land as a breach of international law. Palestinians and most countries view the settlements as illegal, which Israel disputes.

Both Trump and Netanyahu face political challenges at home. Trump was impeached in the House of Representatives last month and is on trial in the Senate on abuse of power charges.

20,2020/01/28,Xi says China fighting ‘demon’ virus as death toll rises to 106,"President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday China was in a struggle against a “demon” epidemic, as the death toll from the new SARS-like virus soared to 106 and the first cases of human-to-human contagion were detected abroad.

Mr. Xi made his remarks during talks with head of the World Health Organisation in Beijing as a host of nations prepared to airlift their citizens from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak.

“Chinese people are currently engaged in a serious struggle against an epidemic of a new type of coronavirus infection,” Mr. Xi told WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Pledges transparency

“The epidemic is a demon, and we cannot let this demon hide,” the Chinese leader said, pledging that the government would be transparent and release information on the virus in a “timely” manner.

His comments came after anger simmered on Chinese social media over the handling of the health emergency by local officials in central Hubei province, where the disease first emerged in December.

Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about this virus compared to its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-2003.

But others say local cadres had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month.

Since then, the number of cases has soared — doubling to more than 4,500 in the past 24 hours.

Contagion abroad

WHO chief Tedros praised China’s response to the crisis during a meeting with Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to state news agency Xinhua.

Global concern has been growing, with Japan and Germany on Tuesday reporting the first human-to-human infections outside China.

Until now, all cases in more than a dozen countries involved people who had been in or around Wuhan.

Britain had to weigh its “special relationship” with the U.S. against Chinese trade and investment ties which it wants to develop after leaving the EU.

Mr. Johnson, in the biggest test of his post-Brexit foreign policy to date, ruled that “high-risk vendors” would be allowed into the “non-sensitive” parts of 5G networks.

However, their involvement will be capped at 35%, they will be excluded from the sensitive core, where data is processed, and they will be banned from all critical networks and locations such as nuclear sites and military bases, the government said.

The decision will dismay President Donald Trump's administration which fears China could use Huawei to access Western communications. It warned London that giving Huawei a role would risk intelligence cooperation.

The White House and U.S. state department did not immediately respond for a request to comment.

“This is a UK-specific solution for UK-specific reasons and the decision deals with the challenges we face right now,” Communications Secretary Nicky Morgan said following a meeting of the National Security Council chaired by Johnson.

The telecoms industry has warned that banning Huawei would cost it billions of dollars and delay the 5G roll out. Huawei's equipment is already used by Britain's biggest telecoms companies such as BT and Vodafone, but it has been largely deployed at the edge of the network.

China's ambassador to London Liu Xiaoming said last year that a block on Huawei would hurt Chinese trade and investment in Britain, telling the BBC it would “send a very bad message not only to Huawei but also to Chinese businesses”.

Huawei was not mentioned by name in the British government's statement, but British cyber security officials said they had always treated the company as a “high risk” vendor.

Huawei said it was reassured by the UK government's confirmation that it could continue working with its customers to keep the 5G roll-out on track.

“This evidence-based decision will result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure that is fit for the future. It gives the UK access to world-leading technology and ensures a competitive market,” Huawei vice president Victor Zhang said.

CALCULATED COMPROMISE

A U.S. official involved in talks with the UK said the limitations were a positive step, but didn't go far enough.

“The concern is that they still want to allow Huawei into the computer that's happening in so-called periphery, that is just unacceptable,” the official said.

“It's a computing device, so shouldn't be supplied by Huawei. There's the potential for all sorts of nefarious activity there.”

Sources told Reuters last week that senior British officials had proposed granting Huawei a limited 5G role, a “calculated compromise” which could be presented as a tough restriction to Washington, while accepted by British operators.

Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, has said the United States wanted to frustrate its growth because no U.S. company could offer the same range of technology at a competitive price.

The United States has argued that the distinction between ”edge” and “core” will blur as data is processed throughout 5G networks, making it difficult to contain any security risks.

British cyber security officials said they had put special measures in place to mitigate any risks.

“We've never 'trusted' Huawei and the (measures) you can see exist because we treat them differently to other vendors,” Britain National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency, said in a technical post.

The NCSC said the notion that there was no way to separate core and edge parts of the 5G network “remained untrue”.

22,2020/01/28,Taliban assault on Afghan police base kills 11,"Taliban militants attacked a police base in northern Afghanistan, killing 11, possibly with help from at least one of the policemen inside, local government officials said Tuesday.

The insurgents first overran a checkpoint near the base late Monday, and were apparently able to breach the compound with ease because a sympathetic policeman opened a door for them.

These details were provided by Mabobullah Ghafari, a provincial councilman in Baghlan province where the attack took place. A local police official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to brief reporters about the attack, also gave the same account.

Insider attacks have been steady throughout Afghanistan’s 18-year conflict, with U.S. and NATO troops most often targeted. But when Afghan security forces are targeted, the casualty rate is often much higher.

Last July, two U.S. service members were killed by an Afghan soldier in the southern Kandahar province. The shooter was wounded and arrested. In September, three U.S. military personnel were wounded when a member of the Afghan Civil Order Police fired on a military convoy, also in Kandahar.

Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack on the outskirts of Puli Khumri, Baghlan’s provincial capital. The Taliban have a strong presence in the province and frequently target Afghan security forces in and around the city.

Last September, the insurgents attacked Puli Khumri and blocked the city’s main highway to the capital Kabul for more than a week.

The Taliban currently control or hold sway over around half the country.

The U.S. and the Taliban are currently attempting to negotiate a reduction in hostilities or a cease-fire. That would allow a peace agreement to be signed that could bring home an estimated 13,000 American troops, and open the way to a broader post-war deal for Afghans.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taliban-assault-on-afghan-police-base-kills-11/article30675908.ece
23,2020/01/28,U.S. air crash in Afghanistan may have killed top CIA official: Iranian media,"The American surveillance plane that crashed in Afghanistan’s Ghazni province on Monday may have killed Michael D’Andrea, CIA’s head for Iran, Iranian media has reported.

The Iran Front Page news website (IFPNews) has reported, quoting Russian intelligence sources, that the plane served as Mr. Andreas’ mobile command post.

It said the Afghan Taliban was in possession of ‘documents’ apparently recovered from the wreckage of the plane. On Monday, the Taliban claimed that the U.S. aircraft had been “brought down” in the Ghazni province, but did not appear to take direct responsibility for the alleged attack.

“The plane, which was on an intelligence mission, was brought down in Sado Khel area of Deh Yak district of Ghazni province,” said Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid in a statement.

Taliban social media accounts have also posted unverified footage of the wreckage with distinct U.S. Air Force markings. The video shows a burnt out Bombardier E-11A plane, extensively used for electronic surveillance by the U.S. Air Force in Afghanistan.

Analysts point out that in case it could be established that the plane was shot down by the Taliban, it could ruin prospects of a revived dialogue between the U.S. and the militant group, essential for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from Afghanistan — a key campaign issue for U.S. President Donald Trump’s seeking his second term in office.

Unsurprisingly, U.S. military spokesman Colonel Sonny Leggett said in a statement, “While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire.”

The IFP news website obliquely linked the crash with the assassination of Iranian Commander Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike outside Baghdad airport on January 3. Mr. Andreas “who was responsible for the assassination of Iran’s top commander Lieutenant General Qasem Soleimani, was apparently among the officers on board the plane,” it said quoting the Veterans Today website.

The Iran’s Press TV quoted remarks by Hossein Salami, chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC), that “none of American military commanders would be safe in any part of the world, if the U.S. administration continues to threaten the Iranian commanders”.

Addressing a meeting of the Basij paramilitary commanders on Monday in reaction to recent comments by a U.S. official of a possible follow-up assassination of Gen. Soleimani’s successor, Major General Hossein Salami said: “I mean, if they threaten our commanders with [an act of] terror or implement their threat, the lives of none of their commanders would be safe.”

The Press TV website quoted an interview with the Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al-Awsat on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos with U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook who apparently said Washington will assassinate Gen. Soleimani’s successor Esmail Qaani if the Islamic republic persisted with following “the same path of killing Americans ...”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yra59/article30675590.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PLANEKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-air-crash-in-afghanistan-may-have-killed-top-cia-official-iranian-media/article30675591.ece

25,2020/01/28,Netanyahu pulls request for immunity on corruption charges,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu withdrew his request for immunity from prosecution on January 28, hours before parliamentary proceedings on the subject were set to begin.

Mr. Netanyahu, who was visiting Washington D.C. ahead of the launch of U.S. President Donald Trump’s long-anticipated peace plan, said he “decided not to let this dirty game continue”, in a statement issued on his official Facebook page.

Israel’s Parliament, the Knesset, was set to convene to discuss the formation of a committee to debate the Prime Minister’s immunity request. It’s still expected to meet even after the withdrawal.

The Knesset was widely expected to reject Mr. Netanyahu’s immunity request, which would have dealt a massive blow to the Prime Minister ahead of the March 2 parliamentary elections — the third in less than a year. Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud party was planning to boycott Tuesday’s Knesset session.

Mr. Netanyahu’s retraction paves the way for legal proceedings against him to go forward. He was indicted on counts of fraud, breach of trust and bribery in November in three separate cases. He has denied any wrongdoing.

“In this fateful hour for the people of Israel, when I am in the United States on a historic mission to design the permanent borders of Israel and ensure our security for decades to come, the Knesset is expected to start another spectacle in the circus of removing immunity,” Mr. Netanyahu wrote.

Mr. Netanyahu’s chief political opponent, Benny Gantz, who leads the Blue and White party, said in a statement that “Netanyahu is going to trial — we must go forward.”

“Nobody could run a country and simultaneously manage three serious criminal charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust,” Mr. Gantz added. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz are set to face off in a third round of national elections after two inconclusive elections in 2019.

Ayman Odeh, leader of the Joint List of Arab parties in the Israeli parliament, said “the path to trial is paved and no diplomatic public relations stunt in the world” would prevent him from being brought to justice.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wraqfd/article30673965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28NETANYAHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/netanyahu-pulls-request-for-immunity-on-corruption-charges/article30673966.ece
26,2020/01/28,Kobe’s helicopter tried to climb to avoid clouds before crash,"The pilot of the helicopter that crashed near Los Angeles, killing former NBA superstar Kobe Bryant and eight others, told air traffic controllers in his last radio message that he was climbing to avoid a cloud layer before plunging more than 1,000 feet (305 meters) into a hillside, an accident investigator said.

“The radar indicated that the helicopter reached a height of 2,300 feet (701 meters) on Sunday morning before descending, and the wreckage was found at 1,085 feet (331 meters),” Jennifer Homendy of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said.

NTSB investigators went to the crash site in Calabasas on Monday to collect evidence.

The debris field is pretty extensive, Ms. Homendy said. “A piece of the tail is down the hill,” she said.

She said that the fuselage is on the other side of that hill. And then the main rotor is about 100 yards (91 meters) beyond that. Some experts suggested that the pilot might have gotten disoriented because of fog but Ms. Homendy said that investigating teams would look at everything from the pilot’s history to the engines.

“We look at man, machine and the environment,” she said, adding that weather is just a small portion of that.

The pilot had asked for and received special clearance to fly in heavy fog just minutes before the crash and was flying at 1,400 feet (427 meters) when he went south and then west. The pilot then asked for air traffic controllers to provide flight following radar assistance but was told the craft was too low for that assistance.

“About four minutes later, the pilot advised they were climbing to avoid a cloud layer,” she said. “When ATC asked what the pilot planned to do, there was no reply.”

Radar data indicated that the helicopter climbed to 2,300 feet (701 meters) and then began a left descending turn. Last radar contact was around 9:45 a.m. Two minutes later, someone on the ground called 911 to report the crash.

Randy Waldman, a helicopter flight instructor who teaches at the nearby Van Nuys airport said that a disoriented pilot might have only moments to avoid a fatal dive.

“If you’re flying visually, if you get caught in a situation where you can’t see out the windshield, the life expectancy of the pilot and the aircraft is maybe 10-15 seconds, and it happens all the time, and it’s really a shame, Mr. Waldman said.

Some experts raised questions of whether the helicopter should have even been flying. The weather was so foggy that the Los Angeles Police Department and the county sheriff’s department had grounded their own choppers.

The Sikorsky S-76 killed the retired athlete, Kobe Bryant along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and everyone else aboard and scattering debris over an area the size of a football field.

Crews recovered three bodies on Sunday and resumed the effort on Monday amid an outpouring of grief and shock around the world over the loss of the basketball great who helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers to five NBA titles during his dazzling 20-year career.

The pilot was identified as Ara Zobayan. He was the chief pilot for Island Express Helicopters, the aircraft’s owner, the company said in a statement.

“Ara has been with the company for over 10 years and has over 8,000 flight hours,” the company said, adding that it was working closely with the NTSB to investigate the crash.

Zobayan was commercially certified as a pilot and certified as a flight instructor, Ms. Homendy said.

Several aviation experts said that it is not uncommon for helicopter pilots to be given such permission, though some thought it was unusual that it would be granted in airspace as busy as that over Los Angeles.

But Kurt Deetz, who flew for Bryant dozens of times in the same chopper that went down, said that permission is often granted in the area.

“It happened all the time in the winter months in LA,” Mr. Deetz said.

The helicopter left Santa Ana in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, shortly after 9.00 a.m., heading north and then west. Bryant was believed to be headed for his youth sports academy in nearby Thousand Oaks, which was holding a basketball tournament on Sunday in which Bryant’s daughter was competing.

Air traffic controllers noted poor visibility around Burbank to the north and Van Nuys to the northwest. At one point, the controllers instructed the chopper to circle because of other planes in the area before proceeding.

The aircraft crashed about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. When it struck the ground, it was flying at about 184 mph (296 mph) and descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet per minute, according to data from Flightradar24.

Mr. Waldman said that the same thing happened to John F. Kennedy Jr. when his plane dropped out of the sky near Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts, in 1999.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/m5dqlc/article30670349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBITBRYANTTHNAK-28jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kobes-helicopter-tried-to-climb-to-avoid-clouds-before-crash/article30673110.ece
27,2020/01/28,Harvey Weinstein’s sexual assault trial picks up pace,"The closely watched #MeToo era rape trial of Harvey Weinstein is moving at a faster pace than predicted, with three more of his accusers expected to testify against the disgraced move mogul before the end of the week.

A slate of secondary witnesses are due on the witness stand Tuesday to testify before a Manhattan jury about records related to the investigation of Weinstein. The rest of the week could see two women testify about alleged “prior bad acts” by Weinstein - called “Molineux” witnesses - followed by a key witness who says he raped her at a hotel in 2013.

A final Molineux witness would testify next Monday, completing the bulk of a prosecution case that began last Wednesday when there was an expectation that the trial could stretch into March.

On Monday, a second woman at the heart of the case, former “Project Runway” production assistant Mimi Haleyi, wept at times as she detailed her allegation that Weinstein forced oral sex on her at his New York City apartment in 2006.

""I did reject him, but he insisted. Every time I tried to get off the bed, he would push me back and hold me down,” she told jurors, adding that she told Weinstein she was menstruating in an attempt to deter him.

Lawyers for the 67-year-old Weinstein have insisted any sexual encounters were consensual and zeroed in on his accusers’ continued contact with him after the alleged assaults.

One of his attorneys, Damon Cheronis, showed jurors a friendly email Ms. Haleyi sent Weinstein after they ran into each other at the Cannes Film Festival in 2008.

On cross-examination, Ms. Haleyi conceded she’d been in contact with Weinstein “not often, but yes occasionally,” and that she sent the 2008 email after a newspaper article reminded her of a conversation they had weeks before the alleged assault.

Last week, “Sopranos” actress Annabella Sciorra testified that Weinstein overpowered and raped her after barging into her apartment in the mid-1990s. While outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges, Ms. Sciorra’s allegations could be a factor as prosecutors look to prove Weinstein has engaged in a pattern of predatory behavior.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/r5qvt0/article30625310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SEXUALMISCONDUCTHARVEYWEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/harvey-weinsteins-sexual-assault-trial-picks-up-pace/article30672799.ece

29,2020/01/28,U.S. Supreme Court allows stricter green card rules,"The U.S. Supreme Court, voting along conservative–liberal lines of 5-4, permitted the continuation of a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy that makes it more likely that poorer immigrants would be denied green cards.

The court stayed an injunction on an August policy of the DHS that expanded the definition of which potential immigrant seeking admission into the U.S. is likely to become a “public charge”, i.e., in need of State support. Such individuals can be denied admission into the U.S., or if seeking to adjust their visa status to a green card, once already in the U.S., can be denied their green card. Refugees and asylees are among those exempt from the provision. Among the risk factors of making an individual a “public charge” under the new definition are age, English-speaking ability and education. Non-white individuals are likely to be disproportionately affected by the new rule as per critics. The new rule may also cause individuals to discontinue their enrolment in Medicaid (a programme that helps individuals on a low income with medical costs) or deter them from enrolling, as per a study from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Several lower courts had blocked the DHS rule after immigrant groups, individuals, State and city governments had gone to court over the issue.

All four liberal justices of the Supreme Court said they would have denied the stay on the injunction. Conservative justice and Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch took issue with lower courts particularly a U.S. District Court in New York which passed a nation-wide injunction on the policy in October.

“Today the Court (rightly) grants a stay, allowing the government to pursue (for now) its policy everywhere save Illinois,” Justice Gorsuch wrote. “But, in light of all that’s come before, it would be delusional to think that one stay today suffices to remedy the problem. The real problem here is the increasingly common practice of trial courts ordering relief that transcends the concurring cases before them.”

Meanwhile the case will continue to be heard in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (based in New York) in the next few weeks.

“Self-sufficiency and self-reliance are key American values not to be litigiously dismissed, but to be encouraged and adopted by the next generation of immigrants. We plan to fully implement this rule in 49 States and are confident we will win the case on the merits,” Ken Cuccinelli, Acting DHS Deputy Secretary said in a statement released on Tuesday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/hbqxxu/article30144502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-Supreme-CourGTE6PTO323jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-supreme-court-allows-stricter-public-charge-rule-to-go-through/article30672313.ece
30,2020/01/28,New Zealand’s Ardern seeking reelection in Sept. 19 vote,"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern may be lauded around the world as a liberal icon but whether she can translate that into a reelection victory in September remains uncertain.

Ms. Ardern on Tuesday announced the general elections would be held on Sept. 19. She is seeking a second term in office and is expected to face tough competition from conservative challenger Simon Bridges.

Voters will also decide on two contentious social issues in referendums on the same date- whether to legalize euthanasia, and whether to legalize recreational marijuana.

Ms. Ardern promised to run “a positive, a factual and a robust” election campaign.

""New Zealanders deserve freedom from misinformation and some of the negative style of campaigning that we have seen take place overseas,” she said.

She said her government was responsible for overseeing a strong economy and making crucial investments in health, education and reducing child poverty.

Ms. Ardern is seen by many of her supporters globally as the antithesis of President Donald Trump. She was widely lauded for her empathy after a white supremacist gunman attacked two mosques in March, killing 51 Muslim worshippers. She is also seen as a role model of a high-profile working mother after giving birth to a daughter while in office.

But her international acclaim has sometimes been regarded with suspicion at home, where she and her Labour Party remain locked in a tight struggle for support with Bridges’ National Party. Polls indicate the election will be a close contest.

""Bring it on,” Mr. Bridges said in a statement, saying that while Ardern and her Labour Party had promised much, they had delivered little.

""New Zealanders know we will get things done, whether it’s more money in your pocket, a stronger economy, less tax, building infrastructure and roads or keeping families safer from increasing gang violence,” Mr. Bridges said.

Under New Zealand’s proportional voting system, which is similar to the model used in Germany, political parties must generally form alliances to govern. That makes the votes won by smaller parties crucial to the outcome. That was the case in the last election, with mercurial politician Winston Peters and his small New Zealand First party choosing to side with Ardern, allowing her to govern.

The scramble for votes appears to be already underway, with Ardern due Wednesday to announce billions of dollars in extra infrastructure spending.

32,2020/01/28,Sri Lanka suspends visa on arrival for Chinese citizens after first case of coronavirus,"Sri Lanka suspended its policy of granting visa on arrival for Chinese travellers on Tuesday, a day after the health authorities detected the country’s first coronavirus infection.

Sudath Suraweera, the chief epidemiologist of the country’s health ministry, said on Monday that a 40-year-old Chinese woman was found positive for the virus.

“She arrived on January 19 and was tested positive for the virus when she was leaving the airport on January 25. She was admitted to the infectious diseases hospital,” he said.

Following the first detection of the coronavirus case, the Sri Lankan health authorities ordered the suspension of the on arrival visa policy for the Chinese nationals.

Travellers from China must apply for visa via the online portal, the authorities said.

The officials at Colombo international airport said the entry to airport’s arrival and departure terminals had been restricted to passengers only.

Some 65 Sri Lankan students in China returned by Monday. Another flight to evacuate students is due to leave on Tuesday. A total of 204 students have been evacuated in the last three days.

The government has said that it has completed the collection of information on students in China. A National Action Committee to prevent the spreading of coronavirus was convened on Monday. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed the committee comprising health experts.

Sri Lanka has become a major travel destination for Chinese tourists. Many Chinese nationals also work on Chinese-funded infrastructure projects - including a sea port, port city and highways.

The death toll in China’s deadly coronavirus epidemic has crossed the 100 mark while the confirmed cases have gone up to 4200.

33,2020/01/28,Justices allow enforcement of new green card rule,"A divided Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to put in place a policy connecting the use of public benefits with whether immigrants could become permanent residents.

The new policy can be used to deny green cards to immigrants over their use of public benefits including Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers, as well as other factors.

The Justices’ order came by a 5-4 vote and reversed a ruling from the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that had kept in a place a nationwide hold on the policy following lawsuits that have been filed against it.

The court’s four liberal Justices, Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, would have prevented the policy from taking effect.

Federal appeals courts in San Francisco and Richmond, Virginia, had previously overturned trial court rulings against the policy. An injunction in Illinois remains in effect, but applies only to that state.

The lawsuits will continue, but immigrants applying for permanent residency must now show they wouldn’t be public charges, or burdens to the country.

The new policy significantly expands what factors would be considered to make that determination, and if it is decided that immigrants could potentially become public charges at any point in the future, that legal residency could be denied.

Roughly 5,44,000 people apply for green cards annually. According to the government, 3,82,000 are in categories that would make them subject to the new review.

Immigrants make up a small portion of those getting public benefits, since many are ineligible to get them because of their immigration status.

In a separate opinion, Justice Neil Gorsuch urged his colleagues to confront the “real problem” of so-called nationwide injunctions, orders issued by a single judge that apply everywhere. In this case, even though the administration won rulings in two different appellate courts covering 14 states, its policy could not take effect.

34,2020/01/28,China reports 25 more virus deaths as U.S. prepares evacuation,"China on Tuesday reported 25 more deaths from a new viral disease as the U.S. government prepared to evacuate Americans from the city at the center of the outbreak.

Authorities reported 24 deaths in Hubei province, where the virus first was detected in December, and one in Beijing, the Chinese capital.

No national total was immediately announced but with 81 deaths reported through Monday, that would make the toll at least 106.

35,2020/01/28,Germany identifies first case of deadly coronavirus,"Germany has declared its first confirmed case of the deadly coronavirus that broke out in China.

Bavaria's health department said late on Monday that a man in the town of Starnberg, 30 km southwest of Munich, has been confirmed as suffering from the virus.

The patient is in “good condition” and isolated under medical observation, Bavaria's health department said in a statement posted on its website. It did not disclose any details of the patient's age or nationality.

“People who have been in contact [with the patient] have been informed in detail about possible symptoms, hygiene measures and transmission channels,” the health department said.

The virus, that broke out in the central Chinese city of Wuhan at the end of last year, has thus far killed 100 people, infected over 2,800 others, stranded tens of millions during the big Lunar New Year holiday and rattled global markets.

36,2020/01/28,At least 8 killed in marina boat dock fire: Alabama fire chief,"At least eight people were killed early Monday in an explosive fire that consumed at least 35 vessels docked along the Tennessee River.

Scottsboro Fire Chief Gene Necklaus said all eight people known to be missing were confirmed dead, and “that number could go up, because we don’t know how many were on boats” that sank.

The fire began just after midnight and quickly consumed the dock as people were sleeping. The wooden dock went up in flames and an aluminum roof that covered many of the vessels melted and collapsed, cutting off escape routes and raining debris over the area as boaters leaped into the river. At least seven people were sent to hospitals suffering from exposure to the flames or the frigid water.

Necklaus said about 35 boats were destroyed, some of them sinking at the dock and others floating away before going under. He said divers need to locate each one and search them individually to be sure there were no other victims.

“There were numerous people rescued from the water who had escaped by going into the water,” Jackson County Chief Sheriff’s Deputy Rocky Harnen told shortly after dawn. “We’re trying to get divers down here to search for possible victims.”

People were jumping onto a boat at the end of the dock because fire had consumed the middle portion and that was their only escape. But then the flames spread to that boat, leaving water as their only way out, Durham said. “Water was the only place they had to go,” Durham said. “Its just extremely sad. It’s horrible.”

Reaching the victims proved challenging for rescue crews. “The damage from the dock has fallen on top of the boats, and some of the boats have drifted off,” Harnen said.

Most of the boats that were destroyed had people living on them permanently, but some mainly spent weekends on them, Durham said. The park includes a boat ramp, a dock and a restaurant, and offers boat rentals, according to Jackson County’s government website.

“Everybody is just hoping to find the ones they knew on that dock. There were families there. It’s devastating,” Durham said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/miv9ed/article30671933.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ALABAMA-FIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/at-least-8-killed-in-marina-boat-dock-fire-alabama-fire-chief/article30671935.ece
37,2020/01/28,Six Chad soldiers killed in Boko Haram attack,"Six Chadian soldiers were killed and 10 injured in an ambush attributed to the Boko Haram jihadist group in the volatile Lake Chad region on Monday, the country’s army said.

The latest in an intensifying wave of jihadists attacks took place in the afternoon close to Tetewa island in the lake. “Our men were on patrol when they were attacked by Boko Haram elements,” Army Chief of Staff Taher Erda said.

“Our forces were looking for Boko Haram elements when they were ambushed around Mandrari, a place with lots of tall grass,” a local official speaking on condition of anonymity told AFP. For the last several months jihadist attacks have intensified around Lake Chad, which is riddled with islands and swamps and shared by Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Nigeria.

Chad has suffered a particularly heavy toll since the beginning of the year. On January 20 a female suicide bomber killed 9 civilians in the village of Kaiga Kindjiria, near the lake.

Boko Haram was formed in Nigeria but its attacks have spread to neighbouring countries. The group has also split and a faction affiliated with the Islamic State group, ISWAP, is particularly active around Lake Chad.

Earlier this month, 1,200 Chadian troops, deployed as part of a regional force in Nigeria, returned to Chad to be redeployed around the lake.

The rising number of attacks has deteriorated the humanitarian situation around the lake, which is considered one of the poorest regions in the world.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/six-chad-soldiers-killed-in-boko-haram-attack/article30671914.ece
38,2020/01/28,Coronavirus | First case confirmed in Germany: Bavarian health ministry,"Health authorities in Germany’s southern Bavarian region have confirmed the country’s first case of the deadly coronavirus.

The virus, which can cause a pneumonia-like acute respiratory infection, has in a matter of weeks killed more than 80 people and infected some 2,740 in China, while cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries.

“A man in the Starnberg region has been infected with the new coronavirus,” a spokesperson for the ministry said, adding that the patient was under surveillance in an isolation ward. The ministry gave no further details on how the patient came to be infected but said he was in a “medically good state”.

France was the first European country to be affected by the outbreak, which has reported three known cases of the virus. All three had recently travelled to China and have been placed in isolation. Germany has recommended its citizens avoid “unnecessary” trips to China as the virus spreads. The country is also considering the possible evacuation of its nationals from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7uhzsq/article30651374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-first-case-confirmed-in-germany-bavarian-health-ministry/article30671912.ece
39,2020/01/28,U.S. military jet ‘crashes’ in Taliban territory in Afghanistan,"A U.S. military jet crashed in the mountainous territory of eastern Afghanistan, where there is a heavy Taliban presence, the Pentagon confirmed Monday, rejecting the insurgents’ suggestions that it was shot down.

Afghanistan U.S. Forces spokesman Colonel Sonny Leggett confirmed in a statement that the aircraft was a U.S. Bombardier E-11A, a type of jet used as a military airborne communications node in the region. “While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire,” he said.

Col. Leggett gave no information on casualties in the crash. Earlier, a Taliban spokesman said the plane had crashed and there were no survivors, but another version of the statement from the insurgents said they had brought the plane down.

“An aircraft of American occupiers has crashed in Ghazni province,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a Pashto-language statement, adding that all crew members onboard had been killed. Large swathes of rural areas in Ghazni province are controlled or under the influence of Taliban militants, making access difficult for officials.

Crash video

Footage published by a Taliban-affiliated account showed people speaking Pashto walking around a crashed plane that resembled an E-11A and appeared to have U.S. military markings. The plane’s fuselage lay in a snow-covered field fractured and heavily burnt, with smoke continuing to billow from it.

Crashes involving military flights, particularly helicopters, are common in Afghanistan where inclement weather and creaky aircraft are often pressed to their limits in the war-torn country. Initial reports said the downed aircraft was an plane from State-owned Ariana Afghan Airlines.

But the company and Afghanistan’s civil aviation authority both denied that the plane was a commercial flight. “All the flights of Ariana Afghan Airlines have been completed normally,” said a statement on the carrier’s Facebook page. Aviation authorities said “no commercial airline crash has been recorded. And Ariana Afghan Airlines have reassured us that all their planes are accounted for.”

Taliban talks

The incident comes as Washington and the Taliban continue to wrangle over a possible agreement that would see U.S. troops begin to leave Afghanistan in return for security guarantees.

The Taliban are aiming to reach a withdrawal agreement with the U.S. by the end of January and are prepared to “scale down” military operations ahead of signing a deal, their chief spokesman said earlier this month. The two sides had been negotiating the deal for a year and were on the brink of an announcement in September 2019 when U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly declared the process “dead”, citing Taliban violence.

Talks were later restarted in December in Qatar, but paused again following an attack near the U.S.-run Bagram military base in Afghanistan. Taliban sources told AFP earlier this month they had offered to initiate a brief ceasefire of seven to 10 days, but there was no announcement of the proposal by either party.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/icjmko/article30670339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OG2SOjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-military-jet-crashes-in-taliban-territory-in-afghanistan/article30670338.ece
40,2020/01/28,Coronavirus: Global alarm heightens as Beijing reports first fatality,"China’s capital on Monday recorded its first death from a deadly coronavirus as it struggles to contain a rapidly spreading disease that has sparked global alarm, with countries scrambling to evacuate their citizens from the epicentre of the epidemic.

The fatality in Beijing raises the death toll from the new virus to 82, with more than 2,700 people infected across the nation. Cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries, including the first confirmed patients in Canada and Sri Lanka.

In a sign of mounting official concern, Premier Li Keqiang visited ground zero to oversee containment efforts in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people where the disease first appeared late last month. The government has sealed off Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province, effectively trapping tens of millions of people including thousands of foreigners, in a bid to contain the virus as the Lunar New Year holiday unfolds.

China decided to extend the holiday, initially due to end on January 30, for three days to limit population flows and control the epidemic. U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States has offered Beijing “any help that is necessary” in combating the virus.

The Health Commission in the capital said a 50-year-old-man who visited Wuhan died of respiratory failure on Monday, less than three weeks after visiting the city. More than 700 new infections were confirmed in the country, while the number of suspected cases doubled over a 24-hour period to nearly 6,000.

The youngest infected patient was a nine-month-old baby being treated in Beijing. In Wuhan, AFP reporters saw construction workers labouring on one of two field hospitals that China is racing to complete by next week to relieve overcrowded facilities swamped with people waiting for medical attention.

On day five under quarantine, residents shouted “Go Wuhan” from their windows, according to videos posted online, and a building lit up the night sky with the words in red. “I’m getting more concerned every day,” Do Quang Duy, a 32-year-old Vietnamese masters student in Wuhan, told AFP.

Global fears spread

The United States urged its citizens to ""reconsider"" all travel to China and told them not to go to central Hubei province, where the pneumonia-like virus emerged.

Landlocked Mongolia — which is heavily dependent on trade with China — closed the border with its huge neighbour to cars, cancelled classes until March 2 and suspended large public gatherings. Malaysia banned visitors from Hubei province, where the pneumonia-like virus emerged.

A U.S.-bound flight is scheduled to leave Wuhan on Tuesday with consular staff and some American citizens. Turkey and Germany likewise advised their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to China. France plans to fly citizens out of the city in the middle of this week. Japan will also bring its citizens home.

Belgium, Bangladesh, India and Spain said they were working to repatriate their nationals, while Germany was considering the possibility. The World Health Organization last week stopped short of declaring the outbreak a global emergency, which could have prompted international trade or travel restrictions.

But the world body on Monday admitted it had made an error in the global risk from the deadly virus, assessing it as “high” worldwide, rather than “moderate”. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus headed to Beijing for discussions with Chinese officials.

Global stock markets and oil prices plunged Monday over coronavirus fears.

A nation shuts down

The virus is believed to have jumped to people from animals in a Wuhan market that sold a wide range of exotic wild game. China on Sunday banned all wildlife trade until the emergency subsides.

The virus has caused global concern because of its similarity to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003 and was also traced to the wild game trade. Authorities around China have already imposed aggressive curbs on transport during the usually high-traffic Lunar New Year season to keep the virus from spreading.

At Beijing’s main international airport, almost all passengers wear masks. Fever checks are conducted at subway and railway stations. Typically, hundreds of millions of people criss-cross China in jam-packed buses and trains during the holiday, a time for family reunions.

But the festivities have been ruined this year by coronavirus, which can be transmitted between humans, with people told to avoid gatherings. Countless popular public attractions and seasonal festivals have been shut down. Several Beijing malls shortened their opening hours, according to State media.

The nationwide measures threaten to put a dent in an economy that was already slowing down. Beijing and Shanghai were among places mandating stringent checks and 14-day observation periods for people arriving from Hubei. Wuhan’s mayor Zhou Xianwang said around 5 million people had left the stricken city during the New Year travel rush in January, highlighting fears the virus could spread further.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/oqhkdh/article30671206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OG18Djpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-global-alarm-heightens-as-beijing-reports-first-fatality/article30671205.ece
41,2020/01/28,Underwater bombs damage offshore oil facilities in Syria’s Tartous province,"Bombs planted underwater off Syria’s coast exploded Monday, damaging oil facilities used to pump oil into one of Syria’s two petroleum refineries, State media and the oil minister said.

No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, the third to target Syria’s oil and gas industry in less than a year. The attack off the coast of Banias was carried out by “terrorists” State news agency SANA said. Banias is on the Mediterranean shoreline in the Tartous Province.

Oil minister Ali Ghanem told State TV that the bombs were planted by divers in the facility used to pump oil to the coast. He said the facility is 3 km off the coast and is 23 m underwater.

“The aim of the attack is to cease (oil) imports into Syria,” Mr. Ghanem said, adding the Ministry’s experts were evaluating and fixing the damage. He said the attack would not stop imports as they had prepared plans in case of such attacks.

Last month, near-simultaneous attacks believed to have been carried out by drones hit three government-run oil and gas installations in central Syria. One of the December attacks targeted the oil refinery in the central city of Homs.

Syria has suffered fuel shortages since last year. Western sanctions have blocked imports, while most Syrian oil fields were controlled by Kurdish-led fighters in the country’s east. In June, sabotage attacks damaged five underwater pipelines off Banias.

Before the Syrian conflict erupted in 2011, the country exported around half of the 350,000 barrels of oil it produced per day. Now its production is down to around 24,000 barrels a day, covering only a fraction of domestic needs.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/l7csvq/article30670329.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001N86F3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/underwater-bombs-damage-offshore-oil-facilities-in-syrias-tartous-province/article30670328.ece

Pompeo “expressed his outrage at the continued assaults by Iran’s armed groups against U.S. facilities in Iraq, including yesterday’s rocket attacks against our Embassy, which resulted in one injury,” the State Department said in a statement.

43,2020/01/28,Former production assistant testifies against Harvey Weinstein in ongoing sexual assault trial,"At times sobbing, former production assistant Mimi Haleyi told jurors Monday at Harvey Weinstein’s rape trial how she tried to fight off the disgraced movie mogul and told him “no, no, no” while he sexually assaulted her.

As one of two women whose assault claims led to Weinstein’s charges, Ms. Haleyi took the stand and detailed her claim that he forcibly performed oral sex on her at his New York City apartment in 2006. “I did reject him, but he insisted. Every time I tried to get off the bed, he would push me back and hold me down,” she testified Monday, adding that she told him she was menstruating in an attempt to deter him.

“I checked out and decided to endure it,” she said. “That was the safest thing I could do.”

Weinstein, 67, is charged with sexual assaulting Ms. Haleyi and raping an aspiring actress in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013. He insists any sexual encounters were consensual. She said she didn’t call the police because she was working in the U.S. on a tourist visa and was scared of Weinstein’s power, telling jurors, “Obviously, Mr. Weinstein has a lot more power and resources and connections and so forth. I didn’t think I’d stand a chance.”

Last week, Sopranos actress Annabella Sciorra testified that Weinstein overpowered and raped her after barging into her apartment in the mid-1990s. While outside the Statute of Limitations for criminal charges, Sciorra’s allegations could be a factor as prosecutors look to prove Weinstein has engaged in a pattern of predatory behaviour.

They crossed paths again at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006 and, when Ms. Haleyi expressed interest in working on one of his productions, he invited her to his hotel room and asked for a massage. She declined, saying she was “extremely humiliated.”

“I felt stupid because I was so excited to go see him and he treated me that way,” she testified. More meetings followed, and Weinstein secured Ms. Haleyi a job helping on the set of Project Runway, the reality competition show he produced. She testified that before the alleged assault, Weinstein showed up at her apartment and begged her to join him on a trip to Paris for a fashion show.

“At one point, because I just didn’t know how to shut it down so to speak.... So I said, ‘You know you have a terrible reputation with women, I’ve heard,’” Ms. Haleyi said. The then-revered Hollywood honcho “got offended,” she said. “He stepped back and said, ‘What have you heard?’”

Asked by prosecutor Meghan Hast if she had any romantic or sexual interest in Weinstein, Ms. Haleyi firmly answered- “Not at all, no.”

In testifying, Ms. Haleyi will have to deal with a defence team that said it plans to confront Weinstein’s accusers with their own words — messages they exchanged with Weinstein well after the alleged assaults. Weinstein’s lawyers argue the positive-sounding emails and texts call into question the accusers’ accounts.

The jury of seven men and five women also heard testimony from Dr. Barbara Ziv, a forensic psychiatrist who said that most sex assault victims continue to have contact with their attackers, often under threat of retaliation if the victims tell anyone what happened.

On the stand Monday, Ms. Haleyi said she dealt with the alleged assaults by compartmentalizing, occasionally interacting with Weinstein on a professional basis by passing along scripts from friends or discussing work opportunities.

""Honestly, I didn’t know how to deal with it so it’s almost like I put it away in a box, like it didn’t happen and I just carried along as usual,” she said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/fc4tm6/article30669463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001O581Zjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/former-production-assistant-testifies-against-harvey-weinstein-in-ongoing-sexual-assault-trial/article30669462.ece
44,2020/01/28,Prince Andrew provided zero cooperation on Jeffrey Epstein probe: U.S. Prosecutors,"Prince Andrew has given ""zero cooperation"" to the FBI in its investigation into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, despite publicly offering his assistance, a US prosecutor said Monday.

The British royal denies claims he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured by Epstein and said in November he was ""willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.""

But New York attorney Geoffrey Berman, who is leading an investigation into possible co-conspirators of the disgraced US financier, said Andrew was yet to respond to a request by the FBI and his office for an interview.

""To date, Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation,"" Berman, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, told reporters. Berman gave the comments during a news conference outside Epstein's former Manhattan mansion, which Andrew has admitted staying at.

He said he would not normally comment on whether individuals were cooperating but made an exception for the prince because of his statement offering help. ""It's fair for people to know whether Prince Andrew has followed through with that public commitment,"" said Berman.

Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to request for comment. Queen Elizabeth II's second son stepped back from frontline royal duties after he faced outrage over an interview with the BBC late last year in which he defended his friendship with Epstein.

Andrew, 59, also denied having sexual relations with Virginia Giuffre, who alleges she was trafficked to have sex with friends of Epstein when she was 17. Epstein, 66, killed himself in a New York jail in August while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.

He was a multi-millionaire hedge fund manager who befriended countless celebrities over the years, including US President Donald Trump. Epstein was charged with one count of sex trafficking of minors and another of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors. He denied the charges but was facing up to 45 years in jail if found guilty.

'Ill-judged association'

Determined to obtain justice despite his death, dozens of women who say they were abused by Epstein have sued his estate and prosecutors have pledged to pursue any accomplices.

""Jeffrey Epstein couldn't have done what he did without the assistance of others and I can assure you that our investigation is moving forward,"" Berman said Monday.

Giuffre says she had sex with the prince at the central London home of Epstein's socialite girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001. In what proved to be a disastrous BBC interview, Andrew said he did not remember meeting Giuffre and that he ""absolutely and categorically"" did not have sex with her.

Afterwards he issued a statement in which he said ""I... unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.""

While Epstein's death has been ruled a suicide -- with two prison guards charged for alleged failure to monitor him -- it has also fueled conspiracy theories, mostly speculating he was murdered to stop him revealing compromising information about wealthy acquaintances. Several of Epstein's accusers have said Maxwell recruited them to provide sexual favors for Epstein and some of his associates.

Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of paying young girls for massages but served just 13 months in jail under a secret plea deal struck with the then state prosecutor.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dm08mc/article30670121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Andrew,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/prince-andrew-provided-zero-cooperation-on-epstein-probe/article30670122.ece
45,2020/01/28,Chinese tourist in Sri Lanka tests positive for Coronavirus,"Sri Lanka on Monday reported the first case of Coronavirus, after a Chinese tourist tested positive, health authorities said.

“The Chinese woman is from Hubei Province and in her early 40s. She tested positive today and we have started treatment,” said Dr. Sudath Samaraweera, a spokesman of the Ministry of Health.

The tourist arrived in Sri Lanka on January 19 and reported fever on January 25, after which she was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital near Colombo. “We have also sent her test samples abroad for another confirmation of the results,” Dr. Samaraweera told The Hindu. “Our doctors are very experienced and well equipped to handle the cases,” Dr. Samaraweera added.

Over the last week, Sri Lanka’s health authorities reported five cases of suspected Coronavirus. Of them, two patients tested negative and the results of other patients’ are awaited.

China was the third largest source of tourists to Sri Lanka in 2019, according to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), contributing 9% of the total arrivals of nearly 20 lakh. India is the largest, with 19% of the tourists originating from there. SLTDA records show that over 16,000 Chinese tourists arrived in Sri Lanka in December 2019.

Meanwhile, as many as 21 Sri Lankan students were returning from China following the outbreak, the President’s office said.

46,2020/01/28,This cosplayer from Mumbai will represent India at 2020 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo,"“Zenos yae Galvus is an amazing character,” gushes professional cosplayer Sameer. He continues, “Even though he’s a villain, he is very passionate about the art of war and duelling. The look of that costume is so amazing, you can’t help but feel like a smug warlord; it becomes really easy to act like him. But I did learn his lines and mannerism to portray him believably in front of other fans.”

Anyone familiar with Sameer’s work knows when he cosplays, he goes big in every single way, and his commitment is inspiring to budding artistes in his field. Sameer has been doing cosplay for umpteen years now and he takes each project in stride.

Sameer Bundela, AKA At8

At the recent line-up of Comic Cons India, Sameer drew eyes, gasps and cheers for his recent cosplay as Final Fantasy XIV: Stormblood’s Zenos yae Galvus which had him winning big at this year’s Maruti Suzuki Arena Indian Championship of Cosplay. As part of the prize deal, he will be heading to the three-day 2020 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo (C2e2), which kicks off on February 28, to compete.

When asked about the reactions to his cosplay, he laughs, “The reactions to my costume have been really amazing — both from the people who know the character and the people who didn’t. I got a lot of international recognition for it even before winning the championship. When a lot of people saw the photos of my cosplay online, they thought that it was some new official artwork posted by the company making the game itself.” He cheekily adds that scaring little kids on the Comic Con India floor is more satisfying than it should be.

The win leaves Sameer feeling proud, even though it is his fourth time representing India cosplay on a global scale. Last year, Sameer won ICC for his Skywrath Mage cosplay. In 2018, with his Night Stalker costume, the 29-year-old became the first Indian cosplayer to win a major international cosplay competition, The Kuala Lumpur Major. It is evident that this is not just a passion project, but his life. “Cosplay is one of the most amazing things that we've discovered as humans. The ability to be someone else for a day and make it socially acceptable is such a huge thing, of which the power people just don’t realise.”

Sameer still stays humble when it comes to recounting the many opportunities he has observed. “Cosplay has completely changed my life; I owe my business, social circle, recognition and even my travels to cosplay! It has provided me with so many opportunities and has helped me meet so many amazing people. I just want to play my part by making other people realise how fun and life changing cosplay can be. I'm glad that I was able to give something back to Indian cosplay community by bringing a few laurels to our country and I hope to keep doing it in the future, India has already arrived on the world cosplay map… and it's only going to go big from here.”

Crafting ABCs

While winning presents a thrill for Sameer, nothing gets his heart racing more than crafting his cosplays. With Zenos, it took him four months to complete, but he says there will be modifications made for the Chicago competition.

One has to wonder if picking something so intricate had him hesitating initially. “It certainly excited me, but I was afraid if I'll be able to pull it off. C2e2 is a prestigious competition and I want to leave no stone unturned… Every year my goal is to try something new and learn how to work with new materials,” he explains, “This year, though, I wanted to focus on improving the skills that I had, and work with tools and mediums with which I was already comfortable. Zenos was perfect for it for the intricate design.”

Speaking of complex structures, Sameer points out that Zenos’ armour is “very organic” and has a lot of small parts, and making the entire ensemble seamless and still making all those difficult to construct curve were the most challenging aspects. “I had to number each small part so that I don’t mix them up; there’re literally thousands of foam pieces in this armour. After that, I had to do a lot of sculpting on the costume to make all the details. It all requires a lot of patience. The sword holster was also difficult to figure out; it needed to spin and house three swords, all the while being light enough so that I can carry it around.”

Who is Zenos yae Galvus? Zenos yae Galvus is a Resonant and the main antagonist boss in the Final Fantasy universe. He is a Legatus of the XIIth Imperial Legion and the son of emperor Varis zos Galvus. Raised as an heir apparent, he is conceited and ruthless using The Storm, The Swell, Ame-no-Habakiri for his weaponry.

Such efforts to create the costume were not of the solo variety. “No one person has all the tools and skills necessary to make everything. While the entirety of construction was done by me, I do seek guidance and help from my fellow cosplayers, who have expertise in other parts. Like my friend, Medha Srivastava [who won Fan Favourite at ICC 2020] helped me with the painting of the costume. Her insight and experience were very helpful in achieving the armour’s grungy and beaten metal look. Saurabh Rawat, who has a lot of experience working as an art director, helped me with some of the logistics and mechanisms of the costume.”

It is easy to wonder how Sameer will top this but history has shown that he takes on new challenges with ease. “That's the thrill of it! I have a huge list, including a lot of costumes I'm even afraid to attempt right now. So there will be no shortage of topping this costume in the future, rest assured, I dress to impress!”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/ofyedp/article30673013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy28-zenos-night-face-on,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/cosplay-sameer-bundela-at8-on-zenos-yae-galvus-final-fantasy-stormblood-winner-of-indian-championship-of-cosplay-2020/article30673015.ece
47,2020/01/28,Rajinikanth to feature in ‘Man vs Wild’ with Bear Grylls,"A new episode of Man vs. Wild featuring multilingual star Rajinikanth with British adventurer and television presenter Bear Grylls was shot on Tuesday at Bandipur Tiger Reserve.

An earlier episode of the series featured Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which was shot at the Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarkhand last year.

T. Balachandra, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said Rajinikanth arrived on Monday noon and much of the sequence involving him was completed on Tuesday after which he left Bandipur. Grylls reached Bandipur on Tuesday morning but details about his itinerary were not known, he added.

Mr. Balachandra said they had only permitted the use of cameras and a few equipment required for shooting wildlife documentary and there was no use of heavy vehicles carrying generator sets that normally tag along with film crew. He said most of the sequences was shot along the highway and a bridge while one sequence entailed crossing a waterbody using a coracle.

An agreement was signed between the Karnataka Forest Department represented by the Field Director of Bandipur and a Mumbai-based studio for shooting the documentary in December 2019.

According to sources, much of the sequences was shot at Moolehole, Maddur, and G.S. Betta Range and permission was given to film between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. only. Also, there was no permission to use electricity, explosives or any inflammable material, and flash lights, reflectors, sound, and generators which disturb wildlife.

Timing questioned

Conservationists and wildlife activists, however, have questioned the timing of the shooting as it is approaching summer and the Forest Department staff tend to be deployed on fire watch duties or for clearing ground vegetation to create firebreak. Bandipur has a history of forest fires that burn large swathe of the jungle. Last year, an estimated 10,000 hectares of the jungle was destroyed in the fire that broke out in February.

Sangay Gubbi, conservationist, said these kinds of shows take away focus from real conservation issues. “They are certainly not an educative tool. Our future generations need to see the beauty and the problems our wildlife faces, and not reality shows,” he added. He said this was not the right time for filming when the Forest Department was preparing for the summer months.

Mr. Balachandra, however, denied that the forest staff were disturbed or fire watch duty disrupted.

‘Not injured’

Returning after the shoot, Rajinikanth told presspersons at the Chennai airport that he was not injured during the shoot.

“There were some reports that I was injured. This is not true and I was just pricked by a few thorns,” the actor said.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nixcui/article30673040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bearjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/rajinikanth-to-feature-in-man-vs-wild-with-bear-grylls/article30672978.ece

52,2020/01/28,Central Bank of India: recoveries spur profit,"State-run lender Central Bank of India reported a ₹115 crore net profit for the quarter ended December 31, compared with a ₹718 crore loss in the comparable period of the previous financial year.

The profit of the lender, which is under the prompt corrective action framework (PCA) of the Reserve Bank, was on the back of a sharp rise in recovery from written off accounts, which was ₹520 crore during the quarter as compared to ₹25 crore.

This was mainly due to recovery made from Ruchi Soya, which was resolved through the bankruptcy process. Patanjali Ayurved acquired Ruchi Soya for ₹4,350 crore during the quarter.

The bank’s interest income got a boost due to the resolution of Essar Steel and also helped to write back provisions made earlier. The bank’s interest income increased 4.2% year-on-year to ₹6,029 crore. NPA provisions almost halved to ₹1,104 crore compared to ₹2,077 crore.

Slippages, however, remained high at ₹3,998 crorecompared to ₹1,934 crore.

The slippages included ₹1,800 crore due to divergence, while other slippages during the quarter were at ₹2,445 crore. Among accounts that slipped into the NPA category during the quarter was that of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd., to which the bank had an exposure of ₹900 crore.

“Our exposure to the NBFC sector is ₹12,892 crore, which is 7.8% of the total exposure.

The exposure is mainly to three borrowers, DHFL, Religare Finvest and I-FIN [IL&FS Financial Services],” said Pallav Mohapatra, MD and CEO, Central Bank of India.

Mr. Mohapatra said the bank was aiming to bring down the net NPA ratio to 6% by March from 9.36% at the end of December. This would help the bank to come out of the restrictions imposed under PCA.

“If we grow the net advances by ₹8,000 crore and made recovery of ₹4,000 crore in the fourth quarter, then our net NPA will fall below 6%,” he said.

After posting profit for the third consecutive quarter, the bank is on course to make profit for the full financial year 2019-20, after a gap of five years. The last time when the bank made profit for the full financial year was in 2014-15.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/z389hr/article30677453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/REV-Good-Showcol,https://www.thehindu.com/business/central-bank-of-india-recoveries-spur-profit/article30677454.ece

The firm had posted a net profit of $133 million in the September-December 2018 quarter, it said. Revenue for the quarter stood at $883 million, up 14.2% on constant currency basis, helped by a broad-based growth across voice, data and mobile money.

In a statement, Airtel Africa added that the recent $3 billion fund raise by parent Bharti Airtel, following the October 24, 2018the Supreme Court judgment on AGR, had removed uncertainty over the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

“...the group’s intermediate parent company has successfully raised approximately $3 billion of additional capital through a combination of qualified institutional equity placement and convertible bond offerings. In the director’s opinion the execution of these activities has reduced the level of uncertainty about the ability of the group’s intermediate parent company to comply with the judgment,” it said.

56,2020/01/28,HDFC Bank TN zone business crosses ₹1.5 lakh-crore mark,"Private sector lender HDFC Bank Ltd.’s Tamil Nadu Zone crossed a new business milestone of ₹1.5 lakh crore, said a senior official.

“It took nearly two-and-a-half years to add ₹0.50 lakh crore in total business,” said R. Suresh, zonal head, Tamil Nadu, HDFC Bank.

“Growth-wise, we posted 19% year-on-year in deposits, 19.26% in advances and 19.38% in total business. This is in line with the national growth of HDFC Bank,” he said.

Mr. Suresh said the bank planned to add 125 more branches over the next two years to take the total to 400 in Tamil Nadu. These branches would come up in metro and semi-urban cities. Besides, it will focus on installing more cash deposit machines instead of automated teller machines.

“Our focus will be on offering superior customer experience across all channels — branches, net banking, mobile banking, wallet and chatbot. With the opening of new branches, we will create another 1,000-1,500 jobs in the State, in addition to the 7,000 employees at present,” he said.

57,2020/01/28,HDFC plans to invest ₹100 cr per yr in tech startups: Parekh,"Mortgage finance major HDFC is mulling to invest up to ₹100 crore per year in technology startups, its chairman Deepak Parekh said on Tuesday.

The largest mortgage lender will install a dedicated team understanding the startup ecosystem to do the investments, he said.

The announcement comes at a time when there is a lot of focus on the policy front to encourage startups with an objective of encouraging innovation and creating employment opportunities.

Many corporate entities and also the largest lender SBI have been creating in-house funds to invest in startups.

“At the last board meet, I took an idea of investing Rs 100 crore per year in startups,” Parekh said, speaking at the annual Tiecon event here.

He said just like the idea to branch out into universal banking, the board had reluctance with the idea of investing in startups as well, but underlined that he believes there is a need to invest in ideas of the future in the tech space.

The company will be creating an in-house team at the headquarters to take charge of investments and exuded confidence that they will start operating in two months.

Parekh urged the youngsters not to get “consumed” by the ongoing economic slowdown and exuded confidence that the tide will change soon.

“Do not be disillusioned with the current difficulties. The tide will and has to change,” he told the younger entrepreneurs, stressing that India will be an important engine for the world.

Recounting his days while starting up HDFC Bank, which has become the largest by market valuations now, Parekh said he pushed the board to get into mainstream banking because of the need to diversify beyond its forte of mortgage finance.

The veteran industry player, who has set up many an entity in the over four decades, said honesty, integrity and accountability are the key attributes that create a successful institution.

He said it is never too late to start, mentioning that HDFC itself was started as a retirement venture by H T Parekh when he was 65 years old.

The new institution went through a string on difficulties from its earliest days, including an initial public offering which bombed, difficulties in arranging loans from LIC for which lawyers had to called-in from Washington for convincing and challenges in getting UTI Mutual Fund, the only domestic asset manager, to invest, Parekh said.

He said despite faced with challenges like absence of security enforcement for defaults, HDFC adopted a unique model open for business and recalled that Infosys co-founder N R Narayana Murthy’s first house in the financial capital was bought on a ₹70,000 loan from his company, granted only on the basis of an appointment letter.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ylm46q/article24626801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09PAREKH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/hdfc-plans-to-invest-100-cr-per-yr-in-tech-startups-parekh/article30673341.ece
58,2020/01/28,Five MEP groups table resolution against CAA,"Five groups at the European Parliament tabled a joint motion resolution on Tuesday that “condemned” India’s decision to adopt the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

In a boost for the government’s efforts to counter the resolution, one group of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) with 66 members, that had earlier been a part of the resolution, decided to drop out.

The other five groups, representing a total of 560 of the 751 MEPs in the Parliament, have agreed to the joint motion, although it is unclear how many will finally vote for the resolution.

The final draft, that will be discussed and voted on, retains the strong language condemning the police action on protesters as a “brutal crackdown” particularly on university campuses, and severely criticises the detentions, alleged torture and the Internet shutdown undertaken in Uttar Pradesh and other States.

The resolution also expresses concerns about the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and calls on India to adhere to UN Human Rights Council procedures.

Also Read Lok Sabha Speaker seeks to stall EU debate on CAA

While the EU Parliament has little power to enforce its resolutions, the strong wording of the document could hamper the atmosphere for talks with India.

EU motion calls CAA ‘discriminatory’

The final version tabled says the House, “deeply regrets the adoption and implementation of the CAA, which is discriminatory in nature and dangerously divisive….further calls on the Government of India to engage with various sections of the population in peaceful dialogue and to repeal the discriminatory amendments, which violates India’s international obligations; warns against the increasing nationalism which has resulted, inter alia, in the fuelling of religious intolerance and discrimination against Muslims.”

Reaching out

Over the past few days the government had intensified efforts to reach out to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), with diplomats led by India’s Ambassador in Brussels Gaitri Issar Kumar meeting with the six various groups behind the resolutions criticising India, as well as individual MEPs who might oppose them.

According to government sources, the spotlight was also on the MEPs who were part of the 23-member tour to India, who had been hosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior officials in Delhi, and conducted by the Indian Army during their stay in Srinagar. Of the 23 members, atleast eight belonged to groups that originally tabled a resolution on India, including five from the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), two from the European People’s Party or Christian Democrats (EPP), and one from the Renew Group. The majority of the delegation belonged to the far-right Identity and Democracy group (I&D), which did not propose any resolution on India.

The outreach appeared to be successful in bringing atleast one of the groups, the ECR to India’s side of the debate. Vice-Chair of the ECR group, Hermann Tertsch, who spoke to The Hindu earlier in the day said that his group was “uncomfortable” with the harsh language the other groups were attempting to add.

Indian-origin MEP from the Renew group Dinesh Dhamija too said the draft was “very broad based and ill-informed” and had not been cleared by all the members of each grouping tabling a resolution.

Also Read European Parliament to vote on Kashmir, Citizenship Amendment Act

Mr. Dhamija, is one of 108 members in the Renew group at the European parliament, and said he disagreed with the resolution put forth.

Mr. Dhamija said that he worried most that the resolutions were timed to “derail” India-EU relations ahead of the EU-India summit scheduled for March 13, and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s visit in February. However he denied government claims that Pakistan and Left-wing parties were behind the decision to bring a discussion on India’s citizenship act to the House

Officials also tried to convince MEPs to hold the discussions on Wednesday, but not to hold the vote that is scheduled for Thursday, as had been done with the previous EU Parliament motion on Jammu and Kashmir in September 2019.

An appeal by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla against holding any discussion on India’s “internal law” did not appear to have been heeded, as the Plenary session agenda still mentions the discussion on the CAA will begin on Jan 29 (1815 CET) and a vote will follow on Thursday (after 1100 CET).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1x40pi/article30677738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TH-EU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-reaches-out-to-meps-to-soften-stand/article30677739.ece

60,2020/01/28,Indians saddled with more debt: Congress,"The Congress said here on Tuesday that the debt burden of every Indian had gone up by ₹27,200 over the past five years, and asked the Narendra Modi government to address this concern in the Union Budget as citizens could not pay for the ‘mistakes and incompetence of the government’.

As part of the party’s special series of press conferences on the economy, Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said that while India’s total debt increased by over 71% in the past five-and-a-half years, the per capita gross domestic product increased by only 30%. He asked the Modi government to address the concern in this Budget.

“They have come to power with the promise of putting ₹15 lakh in every bank account, but instead gave a debt of over ₹27,000 to every citizen,” hw said.

The Congress said the government’s data showed that in March 2014, the total debt was ₹53.11 lakh crore, whereas in September 2019, the same had increased to ₹91.01 lakh crore, a net increase of ₹37.9 lakh crore in absolute terms.

“We ask the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, ‘there is no increase in income, no employment, no new investment. How will we bear the burden of this increasing debt?’ Also, why should the people of India bear the burden of the failures of the BJP government?,” he said.

Mr. Vallabh said the per capita debt would not only add to inflationary pressure but would also discourage global institutional investors as international credit rating agencies might downgrade India as an investment destination.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q9gwky/article30677658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TH-CONG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indians-saddled-with-more-debt-congress/article30677659.ece

63,2020/01/28,#MeToo case: Bollywood assistant choreographer alleges harassment,"An assistant choreographer in the Hindi film industry has complained to the Amboli Police and the Maharashtra State Commission for Women (MSCW), alleging harassment by choreographer Ganesh Acharya, who was also named as a co-accused by actor Tanushree Dutta in her sexual harassment complaint against actor Nana Patekar. The police, however, have filed a closure report in Ms. Dutta’s case.

According to Amboli Police, the complainant approached them on Sunday alleging that she had been assaulted by two women at Mr. Acharya’s behest at a club in Andheri.

‘Membership suspended’

“The complainant was at the spot to attend a meeting of the Indian Film and Television Choreographer Association (IFTCA) on Sunday afternoon. She has said in her complaint that Mr. Acharya first had her membership suspended. When she turned up at the meeting to protest against it, he asked two female members from the IFTCA to assault her and throw her out,” an officer with the Amboli Police said.

The Amboli Police registered a Non Cognisable Complaint in connection with the matter, and the complainant subsequently wrote a formal application to the MSCW on it.

In her letter, she has stated that, after being elected as general secretary of IFTCA, Mr. Acharya began asking for a “cut” of ₹500 per dancer every time she secured an assignment to coordinate a dance on any set, to which she refused.

“He also insisted that I become his assistant, but I refused as I wanted to work independently. Whenever I visited his office, he would be watching pornographic videos and even asked me to do the same, saying I would enjoy watching them. I lost my temper and told him to never contact me again,” the letter states.

‘No work’

She has further alleged that after the above incident, she received a letter saying that her membership to IFTCA was suspended. Mr. Acharya also wrote to other members of the IFTCA instructing them to not work with her. As a result, she had not received a single assignment in the past two months and everybody she approached would tell her to “clear her issues” with Mr. Acharya, her letter states.

On Sunday, when she reached the venue of the meeting to put forth her issues, Mr. Acharya began screaming at her and two other women with him, at his behest, started assaulting her till other members intervened, she alleged.

Counseller assigned

“We have received the complainant’s letter and have assigned a counsellor to the case.

64,2020/01/28,"Congress urges ECI to ban campaigns by Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma","A delegation of Congress leaders approached the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday asking for a ban on campaigning by Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur and BJP Lok Sabha MP Parvesh Verma for the February 8 Delhi Assembly elections because of their “provocative statements to incite communal violence”.

“The BJP’s star campaigners Parvesh Verma and Anurag Thakur have used objectionable language. Top BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, are going around the lanes and bylanes of Delhi, making provocative statements to polarise the atmosphere and incite communal violence. The BJP is doing so out of frustration,” senior Congress leader Ajay Maken told reporters after handing over a memorandum.

“The ECI has accepted that they have made provocative statements and we have demanded that they be banned from campaigning,” he added.

Mr. Maken said that the EC informed the delegation led by Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra that a meeting of all senior poll and police officials would be convened on January 31.

Earlier in the day, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram also questioned the ECI for not acting against the BJP leaders.

Commenting on Mr. Thakur’s controversial comments “that seemed to incite people to violence”, Mr. Chidambaram said, “Will it not amount to inciting and encouraging violence against a section of the people? Will the Election Commission of India wake up from its slumber? As every day passes, the rhetoric of the BJP reminds one of Germany in the 1930s.”

India also asked the Pakistan government to investigate the matter and take urgent action for protecting and promoting the security, safety and welfare of its citizens including the minority Hindu community there.

It called on Pakistan to take immediate measures to expeditiously bring the perpetrators to justice.

“India summoned a senior official from the Pakistan High Commission and made a strong demarche against abduction of a girl from Hindu minority from her marriage ceremony on January 25, with the help of local police in Hala city of Sindh province,” an official source said.

India also issued a demarche regarding the desecration of Mata Rani Bhatiyani temple in Tharparkar, Sindh province, on January 26.

The 24-year-old Hindu girl was allegedly abducted by armed assailants from her wedding venue and forcibly converted to Islam before being married off to a Muslim man, community members said, in the latest such incident in the neighbouring country.

Sindh Minister for Minority Affairs, Hari Ram Kishori, on January 28 took cognisance of the incident, which took place last week in Hala town of Matiari district in Sindh province, and asked for a police report.

The All Pakistan Hindu Council (APHC) on January 26 said Bharti Bai was abducted from her wedding ceremony last week and married off to Shahruk Gul after being forcibly converted to Islam.

Meanwhile, Mr. Gul has posted pictures of documents on social media showing that Ms. Bharti converted to Islam in December 2019 and had taken the name Bushra.

Addressing cadets of the National Cadet Corp (NCC) at the annual rally after the Republic Day parade, Mr. Modi said his government was intent on solving decades-old problems facing the country, looking for lasting solutions to them where previous governments had only seen a law and order issue.

He mentioned the settlement of Bru issue as well as the Bodo Accord concluded by the Home Ministry as his government’s work in the Northeast.

Taking on critics of the citizenship law, the Prime Minister Modi said it was being done with the intention to tarnish his image in the world.

“These people are spreading propaganda that the decisions that the government took have affected my reputation in the entire world. These rumour-mongers must understand that I don’t work for my reputation, but for India’s reputation,” he said.

Mr Modi’s remarks came in the backdrop of six resolutions on the CAA and the situation in Kashmir moved in the European Union Parliament. The resolutions have expressed concerns that the CAA would create the “largest statelessness crisis in the world”. Opposition leaders have said India’s image as a progressive democracy based on secular values, has been hit hard by the law.

Taking on the opposition, Mr. Modi said, “The country knows the true face of the people who are applying a communal colour to it.”

Discrimination in Pakistan

Alleging discrimination by Pakistan towards Hindus, Prime Minister Modi spoke about an advertisement by Islamabad calling only non-Muslims for posts for sanitation workers.

“Some time ago, Pakistan’s Army had put out an advertisement. It was an ad for cleaning workers. It said that only non-Muslims could apply for the post. That means it was for these Dalits and other minorities,” he said.

He added that the problem in Jammu and Kashmir has persisted since Independence and “some families and political parties” kept issues in the region “alive”, as a result of which terrorism thrived there.

Severely criticising Pakistan, the Prime Minister said the neighbouring country has lost three wars, but continues to wage proxy wars against India.

“We know that our neighbouring country has lost three wars against us; our armed forces don’t need more than 10-12 days to defeat them. They’ve been fighting proxy wars against India since decades. Today there is a youthful thinking in the country, so it does surgical strikes, airstrikes and teaches a lesson to terrorists after entering their house,” he said.

68,2020/01/28,CEO sends reports to EC on provocative statements by BJP leaders,"The Delhi Chief Election Officer’s (CEO) Office on Tuesday submitted reports to the Election Commission on “provocative” language used by BJP MPs Anurag Thakur and Parvesh Verma while canvassing for party candidates contesting the Delhi Assembly polls, officials said.

During an election rally here, BJP leader and Union minister Anurag Thakur egged on the crowd to raise an incendiary slogan—“traitors should be shot at”—after he lashed out at anti-CAA protesters.

West Delhi’s BJP MP Parvesh Verma on Tuesday said what happened in Kashmir with Kashmiri Pandits could happen in Delhi, warning that lakhs of anti-CAA protesters in Shaheen Bagh could enter homes to rape and kill women.

“The Office of the Delhi CEO has submitted its report to the EC, on the suspected violation of Model Code of Conduct by Anurag Thakur, MP and BJP’s star campaigner, for using provocative slogans,” a senior official of the Delhi CEO office said.

“A report has also been sent in connection with another star campaigner of BJP for Delhi Elections, Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, regarding Shaheen Bagh protests and his tweet regarding religious places,” the official said.

While the official did not specify for which tweet the report has been sent, Mr. Verma had on January 18 tweeted in Hindi that government land in the city encroached by religious structures will be freed if the BJP comes to power in Delhi.

The MP had also said in the tweet that complaints have been received regarding more than 54 mosques and madrassas on government land in the city.

Delhi CEO Ranbir Singh had on Monday sought a report from the North West district’s election officer after Mr. Thakur’s rally.

“We have taken cognisance of the incident and have sought a report from the district election officer. However, we have not received any complaint so far,” a senior official in the Delhi CEO Office said on Monday.

At the rally, Mr. Thakur, the Minister of State for Finance, shouted “desh ke gaddaron ko” to which the crowd responded “goli maro sa*** ko” (shoot down the traitors).

Mr. Thakur was addressing the meeting in support of BJP candidate from Rithala, Manish Chaudhary.

He raised the pitch of nationalism as he linked opposition parties with anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh and with alleged anti-India slogans, and then asked the crowd to raise the incendiary slogan.

69,2020/01/28,"Kashmir Press Club slams ‘deliberate’ denial of Internet access, ask Centre to abide by SC ruling","The Kashmir Press Club (KPC), comprising about 250 working journalists and editors, on Tuesday asserted that the continuing denial of Internet access to members of the media in the Valley was “a deliberate attempt to stifle the Press in the region”.

“We once again remind the government about its duties to ensure freedom of press as well as right to access the Internet, which the Supreme Court declared as an integral part of Article 19 (10) (A),” a KPC spokesman said.

Pointing to the recent Supreme Court verdict defining access to the Internet as a constitutionally guaranteed right, the KPC said the government appeared to have made no headway in ensuring that this right was available to the media fraternity in the Valley.

“This becomes evident as the government has singled out media organisations and journalists by not restoring their Internet,” the spokesman for the press club said, observing that the Internet blockade in Kashmir had, as on Tuesday, completed 177 days. “In fact, there is no direction to Internet Service Providers about restoring Internet to media houses and journalists,” he asserted.

The KPC members also claimed that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) had sought a written undertaking agreeing “to provide complete access to all content and infrastructure as and when required by security agencies”. “This is a serious breach of individual rights and right to privacy,” they said.

The authorities had overlooked ‘net neutrality’ and whitelisted only 301 websites, a listing in which the majority of local news websites, national and international news websites had been dropped, the press club noted. “It is hard to understand the process or yardstick adopted for whitelisting the websites,” they said.

The statement comes as the government has already started a process to restore Internet in phases to government offices, hotels, travel companies and hospitals.

70,2020/01/28,"Talk of ‘minority takeover’ demonises a population, says Abhijit Banerjee","Observing that minorities in India and the United States are “actually minorities” and nowhere close to being dominant, Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee said that he did not feel there is “real fear there’s going to be a Muslim takeover of India”.

Mr. Banerjee said that the talk that “one hears at least from the fringes of the ruling party about the demography of the Muslim population...is really just a way to demonise a population”.

“You could imagine a context when these are two equal groups, and you worry about the other group becoming too powerful. This is just not realistic here,” Dr. Banerjee explained, citing the example of African Americans and Mexicans in the U.S. as minorities that are relatively economically and educationally deprived compared with a much better-off and economically powerful majority.

The Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was speaking to author Udayan Mukherjee at the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet in the Victoria Memorial Hall grounds late on Monday evening, where he touched on a host of other issues such as migration, and whether India could be in recession. Dr. Banerjee was speaking on his book Good Economics for Bad Times at the event.

Experimental approach

Later, on Tuesday, while delivering the convocation address at Calcutta University, the Nobel Laureate spoke about his experimental approach to economics, and research on randomised controlled trials. While speaking of experiments in health and education, Dr. Banerjee explained how immunisation was positively impacted when people were given a kilogramme of dal in India, and how, in Africa, cheaper mosquito nets caused a fall in the number of child deaths due to malaria.

“The starting point of a lot of efforts taken, and for which we won the Prize, came from a very simple point. Even though we are often wise and often able to see things that have deep insights, it is also the case that we are often wrong. Our intuitions about the world are often false,” he said.

On recession

Earlier, on Monday, when asked whether India is facing a recession, Dr. Banerjee said, “We have really no way of knowing. It’s not that this question has an answer and somebody is hiding it. Nobody really knows. We are just picking up the symptoms from different sides.”

Pointing out that India’s statistical apparatus is essentially incapable of capturing short-term changes in the informal sector, he added, “ If you ask me, ‘could we be in a recession?’ There is nothing in data that says we could not be in a recession.”

While the economist observed that poverty in the country has fallen dramatically, he pointed out that, for the first time since the 1960s, average consumption per capita, as measured by the National Sample Survey Organisation, had dropped. “The data was in the public domain for a while, and then the government said the data is bad,” Dr. Banerjee said.

‘Zero effect of migration’

On the economic impact of migration, he said the net effect of migration has been measured in many contexts to essentially be zero. Describing India as a “ slow migration economy”, he said that drivers of migrations across the world are “the push of disasters and not economic pulls”.

“So, you have Iraq, Syria, Venezuela supplying migrants to the world. These are not poor countries. These are middle-income countries, with civil wars, [causing] complete economic disasters. It’s not economic pull that gets a lot of migrants out. It’s the push,” the economist said.

Citing an example from the Greek crisis, where unemployment for the young rose to 50%-60% and the entire welfare system turned bankrupt, he said only 60,000 Greeks left Greece after it. “The image of people waiting at the border to rush in — there is no data for it,” Dr. Banerjee said.

He also pointed out that there was no evidence that migrants depressed low-income wages. “I think people have this idea that these people are coming in and they must be taking my job away. But, in fact, what happens when a lot of people come, [is that] you end up in a slightly different job. You become the manager for these people, the newcomers — you start a restaurant to feed them,” he said.

Budget ahead

On his hopes from the country’s Budget, he added that money must be pumped in to refinance the banking sector and improve infrastructure. “All the vibes I hear are about tax cuts to the middle class. I don’t think there is much leverage in it,” he said, while expressing the wish that the Budget should also not come up with “giveaways to the corporate sector”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ac4tik/article30675981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABHIJITKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/talk-of-minority-takeover-demonises-a-population-says-abhijit-banerjee/article30675982.ece
71,2020/01/28,Review of President’s rejection of mercy plea is very limited: Supreme Court,"The scope of a judicial review of the President’s decision to reject a mercy petition is “very limited”, the Supreme Court on Tuesday orally told the lawyers for Nirbhaya case convict Mukesh.

A three-judge Bench, led by Justice R. Banumathi, refused to accede to a request by Mukesh, represented by senior advocates Anjana Prakash, Rebecca John and Vrinda Grover, for perusal of the original files of the correspondence on his mercy petition and official notings.

Justice Banumathi said the court did not want to wade into an “uncharted territory”. “We do not deem it appropriate to concede the request and the same is declined,” the order read. The court would pronounce its order on Wednesday, she said.

Ms. Prakash and Ms. John argued that the government’s affidavit was “evasive” about whether all “relevant records” on Mukesh’s incarceration were shown to the President for an informed decision. Ms. Prakash said the government was mum on the jail records on his solitary confinement. In several rulings, the court had held that solitary confinement for long would be a reason for grant of mercy.

The lawyers said Mukesh had suffered torture and abuse in prison. They asked whether his medical records from the time of his arrest to the present day were placed before the President. He had access to legal aid only in 2014, two years after the crime. They contended that the mercy petition was quickly rejected, in just a day, without proper application of mind.

“How can you say the President did not apply his mind to the mercy plea,” Justice Banumathi asked. “The President did not apply his mind because all the records were not placed before him,” Ms. Prakash replied.

Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the Ministry of Home Affairs, said all the documents, supported by records, were placed before the President for a decision on the mercy petition. It was decided without delay because the Supreme Court itself had ruled that delay “has a dehumanising effect”.

“A quick decision on the part of the President does not necessarily mean he did not apply his mind… We [the President] cannot delay, we should not delay. It will have a dehumanising effect. Whether mercy is shown by the President or whether mercy is not shown by the President, either should be done as quickly as possible,” he contended.

Mr. Mehta said ill-treatment in prison was not a ground for commutation of the death sentence. “A man who has committed a heinous crime. He was part of the gang that brutally raped and tortured his victim [, he] cannot say he wants mercy because he was ill-treated in prison,” he said.

Besides, death row convicts were housed in separate cells for their own safety, and this would not amount to solitary confinement, he said. “The room is well-ventilated. Air comes in through the barred windows. The prisoner gets time to spend in the yard with the other prisoners. Solitary confinement is when a prisoner is cut off from the world. He is in the dark,” he submitted.

Data for the NPR is likely to be collected in the State between April 16 and May 31.

Talking to presspersons after a party meeting here, ahead of the Budget Session of Parliament, BJD MP and spokesperson Pinaki Misra said that, following objections from the State government, the Centre had clarified that Column 13(2) of the NPR Form was optional and the norm would not be applicable in Odisha.

Mr. Misra further said that the BJD supported the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), but was not in favour of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The BJD’s stand had already been clarified by Chief Minister and party president Naveen Patnaik, he added.

Enumeration of OBCs

Mr. Misra said that in the upcoming Budget Session of Parliament, BJD MPs would raise the demand for enumeration of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the 2021 Census.

In the 2011 Census, OBC enumeration was not carried out, and even if it was done by any chance, it was never disclosed, as a result of which OBC communities, which are a very important part of society, were left out, said Mr. Misra.

It may be recalled that the Odisha Cabinet had on January 11 resolved to move the Centre with the plea to conduct a socio-economic caste enumeration along with the general Census, either by inserting suitable columns in the Census format, or by prescribing a separate format.

‘Huge challenge’

“Unavailability of reliable and authentic data about the exact numbers of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes and Other Backward Classes/Castes, geographical areas of their spread and density has been a huge challenge in ensuring focused and outcome-specific planning,” the Cabinet had said in a resolution.

The BJD Parliamentary Party meeting, which was chaired by Mr. Patnaik, also decided that the party’s MPs would raise various issues, such as a hike in coal royalty, clean energy cess, the Centre’s assistance in compensating GST (Goods and Services Tax) losses, inter-State river disputes, and pending Railway projects, in Parliament.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7o1trz/article30675757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THNAVEENPATNAIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjd-opposed-to-npr-provision-seeking-parents-birthplace-information/article30675758.ece
73,2020/01/28,"BJP MLA in M.P. pans CAA, says law dividing country","Madhya Pradesh BJP MLA Narayan Tripathi, a former Congressman who had last year broken ranks with his party while voting on a crucial criminal law amendment bill, lashed out at the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and said his party should either respect the Constitution by not formulating divisive laws based on religion, or tear it up and throw it away.

Abandoning the party’s national line, the Maihar legislator highlighted how the law had polarised villages, where people who had once been friends and neighbours refused to even look at each other now.

“Where there are internal disputes, peace can’t prevail. We talk about Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family) on the one hand, and on the other divide the country based on religion. The country can’t be run like this,” he asserted.

Stating that he hailed from a rural area and understood villages well, he said, “The poor are still roaming around to get Aadhaar cards made; collecting so many papers just to prove citizenship will be impossible.”

Mr. Tripathi, who was one of only two BJP MLAs to vote for the Criminal Law ( Madhya Pradesh Amendment) Bill, 2019, and had termed the vote a ghar waapsi (homecoming) at the time, also contended that there was rising unemployment, poverty and illiteracy in the country, distinctly countering the Centre’s narrative on the socio-economic progress made in recent years. “Doing vote-bank politics and dividing people on religious lines is not appropriate for today. Where there is no brotherhood, there is no progress,” he said.

Welcoming the BJP MLA’s comments, State Congress spokesman Durgesh Sharma said, “Every Indian who cares for the country and the Constitution will surely speak out against the CAA and the nationwide implementation of the National Register of Citizens. Mr. Tripathi’s opposition is a protest against the divisive ideology of the BJP. And his stand is in the interest of the country”.

Mr. Tripathi’s comments critical of the CAA add to the BJP’s troubles in the State, where it is already grappling with a spate of resignations at its minority cell over the contentious new law since December. Last Friday, 67 members quit the party in Indore and hundreds of workers had earlier quit the party in Khargone, Guna, Burhanpur, Bhopal and Satna districts.

74,2020/01/28,Muzaffarpur shelter home case: Quantum of sentence to be announced on February 4,"A special court, which on January 20 held Brajesh Thakur and 18 others guilty of sexually and physically assaulting girl inmates of a Muzaffarpur shelter home in Bihar, is expected to announce the quantum of sentence on February 4.

The court had earlier fixed Tuesday for hearing arguments on the quantum of sentence on January 28. However, the proceedings were adjourned as the judge was on leave.

Brajesh Thakur was convicted for aggravated sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, gang-rape, rape and other related crimes under the Indian Penal Code and the Juvenile Justice Act. One of the accused, Vicky, was acquitted.

The shelter home was run by an NGO named “Sewa Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti”. Among those convicted are its office-bearers and officials of the State government’s Social Welfare department.

The instances of sexual assault of girl inmates were first recorded by a research team of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, which came up with a report.

On the Supreme Court’s directive, cases pertaining to allegations of sexual abuse of children in the shelter homes of Bihar, including the one at Muzaffarpur, were transferred to the CBI in 2018.

A forensics team collected evidence from the shelter home. The agency recorded testimonies of the victims and also made several arrests, including that of Brajesh Thakur. As it turned out, the accused persons would bring in people, who sexually assaulted the girl inmates. They would also be taken to hotels where they were raped.

75,2020/01/28,Analysis | Rahul Gandhi's Yuva Aakrosh and NRU rally seems part of a Congress gameplan to counter CAA-NRC,"Two days before the Budget Session of 2020 gets underway, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi decided to hold a Yuva Aakrosh (‘youth anger’) rally in Congress-ruled Rajasthan on January 28 to highlight “growing unemployment, rising prices of food items and the consistent slide of economic parameters”.

While it seems natural for the principal Opposition party to focus on the economy ahead of the Budget Session, there is clearly more to Congress thinking than merely timing it well with the Budget Session.

It comes at a time when the fight for Delhi gets more intense with slogans like “tukde tukde gang” and “goli maro desh ke gaddar ko” (‘shoot the traitors of the country’) heard at the election rallies of Union Ministers.

Video clip’s impact

After over a month of peaceful anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, which has now become a symbol of resistance to the new citizenship law and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), the ruling party at the Centre now has a video clip that may suit its political narrative.

In it, former organiser of the Shaheen Bagh protests Sharjeel Imam is heard talking about cutting off Assam from the rest of India, exhorting Muslims to assert their religious identity, and so on. Now, if you consider the fact that Sharjeel Imam is a PhD scholar from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, the now viral video clip is the best thing that could have happened to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The party’s leaders are already trying to argue that the Shaheen Bagh protests are more about Muslim identity than protecting any higher Constitutional principle or a contesting view of nationalism. They are attacking the JNU’s “tukde tukde gang” for creating unrest in the country, and accusing political rivals like the Congress of “minority appeasement”.

Voting nationalism

So, now voters of Delhi will have to decide to choose between the “nationalist” BJP and others like the Aam Admi Party (AAP) and the Congress that are backing protesters whose allegiance to the nation is repeatedly questioned by the BJP.

Home Minister Amit Shah, at a rally in north Delhi, dared Mr. Kejriwal to visit Shaheen Bagh and clarify his stand on Mr. Imam.

As this reporter had pointed out in an earlier piece, both Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Gandhi have been careful not to engage in an “us versus them” narrative — that’s why they avoided going to JNU or Shaheen Bagh, despite backing anti-CAA protesters on social media.

True, the Congress is not the major player in Delhi, but the BJP’s portrayal of it [the Congress] as a party given to “Muslim appeasement” stays, with ramifications far beyond.

Congress’ ‘NRU’

That’s why the Congress, while continuing to oppose the CAA-NRC on grounds that it violates the basic principles of the Constitution, has come up with the NRU or the National Register of Unemployed in an attempt to steer the debate back to bread and butter issues.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ro4c0h/article30675006.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28YUVAAKROSHRALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-yuva-aakrosh-economy-focused-rajasthan-rally-is-timed-to-the-budget-session/article30675007.ece
76,2020/01/28,"Delhi govt. schools in ‘miserable’ condition, says Amit Shah","Attacking the Aam Aadmi Party, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said that BJP MPs found Delhi government schools in a “miserable” condition during their visit and this has “exposed” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s claims of “revolution in education“.

Mr. Shah, who also posted on Twitter a video of the visits by the BJP MPs from Delhi to the schools, was recently invited by Mr. Kejriwal to see for himself the changes in Delhi government schools after the Union Minister had questioned the AAP government’s claims of educational reforms in his election meetings.

The BJP’s seven Lok Sabha MPs from Delhi and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel on Monday visited government schools and claimed there was lack of basic infrastructure as well as poor condition of amenities like drinking water and toilets there.

“Arvind Kejriwal ji you invited me to see the schools run by Delhi government. Yesterday, eight Delhi BJP MPs visited different schools. The miserable condition of these schools exposes your claims of revolution in education. You will have to reply to Delhi people,” Mr. Shah tweeted

Delhi BJP president and North East Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari challenged Deputy Chief Minister and Education minister Manish Sisodia to accompany him to the schools, visited by his party MPs, alongwith mediapersons.

77,2020/01/28,Taranjit Singh Sandhu appointed India’s Ambassador to US,"Senior diplomat Taranjit Singh Sandhu will be the next Indian Ambassador to the United States. Mr. Sandhu, a 1988 batch officer of the Indian Foreign Service, is the current Indian envoy to Sri Lanka and will succeed Harsh Vardhan Shringla, who will take charge as the Foreign Secretary on Wednesday.

Mr. Sandhu’s appointment comes days before the expected visit of President Donald Trump to India. As the top Indian diplomat in Washington D.C., he has to deal with the ongoing Congressional hearings regarding India’s controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA). The other issue on the agenda will be to negotiate with the U.S. authorities, so that the number of H1B visas are not curtailed.

Before flying to Washington, Mr. Sandhu will have to oversee the February visit to Delhi by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka. Mr. Sandhu’s stint in Colombo is considered rather successful by politicians of all hues, and citizens with whom he forged deep friendships in his seven years in the island, on two postings. He served as head of the political wing from 2000 to 2004.

The farewell dinner organised at India House in Colombo on Monday was testimony to the many friendships and professional relationships he had built and maintained over the years.

While it is not uncommon for Sri Lankan leaders in high office to attend events organised by the Indian mission in Colombo, Monday’s farewell event saw virtually all top politicians across political parties, including some with competing interests and known rivalries, seated together with Mr. Sandhu. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was among the early guests — hours before leaving for Singapore on a private visit — while his brother and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was present for the entire evening, with his family.

The crucial appointment came on a day when Foreign Secretary Vijay Keshav Gokhale retired after distinguished service. External Affairs Minister Dr. S.

The evacuation process will take some days, Mr. Jaishankar told reporters at Vadodara airport.

“The aircraft will fly Mumbai-Wuhan-Delhi as per requirement for passenger evacuation,” a senior DGCA official said. The 423-seater double-decker aircraft, with a 12-member crew, will fly as soon as China grants required permissions, he said.

Officials said the government was also working on the issue who will foot the tab for the evacuation.

Mr. Jaishankar, meanwhile asserted that no Indian student had been found to be affected by the virus till date.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said, “The Health Ministry is working to ensure that the Indians in China after their return will be kept in quarantine for two weeks even if they display no symptoms. ”

Thermal screening of passengers for possible exposure to the deadly infection would now be extended to 20 airports from the existing seven and the government would have four more laboratories functional — in addition to the National Institute of Virology in Pune — for testing samples and it would be extended to 10 labs in the coming days, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said. “Like in 2014, because of our alertness we prevented Ebola from entering the country, we are making all efforts and taking all possible measures to ensure there are no cases of nCoV here,” Dr Vardhan said, adding that as of January 28, around 35, 000 passengers had been screened at these airports.

Vigil at border

“We have tested 20 samples for nCoV and so far they all have resulted negative. We also have stepped up vigil in areas bordering Nepal in view of a confirmed case of nCoV detected there,” the Minister said.

Dr. Vardhan stressed the need for self-reporting by people with recent travel history to China if they displayed flu symptoms such as fever, cough and respiratory issues.

79,2020/01/28,JNU Ph.D. student Sharjeel Imam arrested in Bihar,"Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam, who has been absconding after cases were lodged against him for making “seditious and inflammatory” speeches in Aligarh Muslim University on January 16 and other places, has been arrested from an area under the Kako police station in Jehanabad district of Bihar. Kako is his ancestral village. He has been booked under several sections of the IPC

“Yes, he has been arrested and police officials from Delhi have been interrogating him and right now the judicial process is on for his transit remand”, said Jitendra Kumar, Additional Director General of Police (headquarter), in Patna. “We provided active cooperation to the Delhi Police in Sharjeel Imam’s arrest”, he added.

Sources in Jehanabad, however, told The Hindu that Mr. Imam was taken into police custody from Mallik Tola under the Kako Police Station when he was on his way to surrender in a local court along with his lawyer in a vehicle.

Crime Branch officials of the Delhi Police, along with the Jehanabad police, have been conducting raids at his ancestral house for the last three days. On Monday, the police interrogated his younger brother, Muzameel Imam, and three other relatives to know about his whereabouts. On Sunday, the police searched Patna’s Muslim dominated Subzibagh and Phulwarisharief areas.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar told journalists that nobody should be allowed to make hate speeches against India. “Carrying out protests at different locations is one thing, but nobody can talk about the country’s disintegration. “Nobody should do anything that is not in the interest of the nation. The court will decide on the accusations and the arrest…law will take its own course”, he said. “The police must have acted according to the law”.

On Sunday, Mr. Imam’s mother told local journalists that her son was innocent and “his comments are being misconstrued”. “We’ve not brought up our sons like this…they can never ever say anything against the country… we’ve been born and brought up here…where we would go from this place?… ”

Mr. Imam’s uncle, Irshad Imam, said: “Taking mileage out of the Delhi Assembly elections, Sharjeel Imam’s comment is being misinterpreted and he is being hounded… out of his 40-minute video, only 4 seconds are being shown to accuse him”. “Is this fair to accuse someone as anti-national”, he asked.

Sharjeel’s father Akbar Imam, who is no more, contested the November 2005 Assembly elections on a JD(U) ticket from Jehanabad but lost the poll narrowly by 447 votes against RJD candidate S.N. Yadav.

People in the Kako area said the family was well educated and respected and Mr. Sharjeel Imam had been a bright student since childhood.

80,2020/01/28,Supreme Court allows Centre to bring African cheetah to suitable wildlife habitat in India,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday lifted its seven-year stay on a proposal to introduce African cheetahs from Namibia into the Indian habitat on an experimental basis. The plan was to bolster the nearly extinct Indian cheetah population.

In May 2012, the apex court had stalled the plan to initiate the foreign cheetahs into the Palpur Kino sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh fearing they may come into conflict with a parallel and a much-delayed project to reintroduce lions into the same sanctuary. The court was also worried whether the African cheetahs would find the sanctuary a favourable clime as far as abundance of prey is concerned.

However, on Tuesday, a Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde was nudged by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to take the plunge and go ahead with its plans to bring the African cat to India.

But the Bench made sure that the right precautions are taken. It set up a three-member committee, comprising former director Wildlife Institute of India Ranjit Singh, DG of Wildlife Institute of India Dhananjay Mohan, and DIG, Wildlife, Ministry of Environment and Forests to ‘guide’ the NTCA.

Chief Justice Bobde, speaking for the Bench, directed the committee to file a progress report every four months.

The Supreme Court made it clear that a proper survey should be done to identify the best possible habitat for the cheetahs. Every effort should be taken to ensure that they adapt to the Indian conditions. The committee would help, advice and monitor the NTCA on these issues. The action of the introduction of the animal would be left to the NTCA’s discretion.

The hearing came on an application filed by the NTCA that the Indian cheetah is on the verge of extinction.

Several factors contributed to the Supreme Court ordering a stay on plans to introduce the Namibian cheetahs in 2012.

The court was at that point of time impressed by scientific studies which revealed that “the introduction of an alien species should be considered only if no native specie is suitable”.

The court had also been unhappy with the choice of the Kuno sanctuary. “It is not a natural habitat for African cheetah,” the apex court had observed in its May 2102 order.

The court had quoted experts to point out that “no species should be considered for introduction to a new habitat until the factors which limit its distribution and abundance in the native range have been studied and understood by competent ecologists”.

The court was also apprehensive of whether there would be man-animal conflict in Kuno on the cheetahs’ introduction.

But most importantly, the court was worried about the lions in 2012.

“Whether both lions and cheetahs can co-exist is a matter which requires detailed scientific study. Priority has to be given for preservation of our own species,” the Supreme Court had observed in its order seven years ago.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kmnhrw/article30680870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THRDCHEETAH2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-allows-centre-to-bring-african-cheetah-to-suitable-wildlife-habitat-in-india/article30673294.ece
81,2020/01/28,14 sentenced to life in Gujarat Ode killings case get interim bail from SC,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted interim bail to 14 persons sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of 23 people in a Gujarat riots case of 2002, provided they keep aside six hours a week to engage themselves in “spiritual and social service”.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde said they could participate in seminars. The bail would continue until the court decides their appeals against conviction.

These convicts, some of them represented by advocate Astha Sharma, should not enter Gujarat. Ms. Sharma said the appeals were filed in the Ode massacre case. The top court has not published the order copy yet on its official website.

The Bench found that these people were convicted on the basis of the testimonies of one or two witnesses.

The court separated the appellants/convicts into two groups of six and eight. Six of them were convicted on the basis of testimony of one witness and eight on the accounts given by two witnesses. The former would remain in Indore and the latter group of eight men would stay on in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh.

The Bench acknowledged the submission made by Ms. Sharma that these men had been released on parole, furlough, etc., and not committed any crime. They had also returned to custody.

HC ruling

The Gujarat High Court had upheld the conviction of a total of 19 persons in the Ode massacre case.

Twenty-three persons of a minority community were killed by rioters at Ode village in Anand district in central Gujarat.

The May 11, 2018 Gujarat High Court judgment of a Bench, led by Justice Akil Kureshi, narrated in detail the series of incidents which led to the deaths of the 23 victims.

On February 27 of 2002, the infamous Godhra train burning incident happened. A few days later, on March 1, an agitated mob collected in the surrounding fields and entered residential areas which had “pockets of Muslim houses and shops.” The mob started pelting stones and damaging property. The police could not control the rioters. The mob then surrounded seven houses where Muslim families lived and set them on fire by throwing burning rags at them.

Many of the people first tried to take shelter at a nearby three-storied building. However, many ran out, while 23 of them stayed back to meet a “gruesome fate”.

“According to the prosecution, all of them were burnt alive. The heat was such that they were burnt to ashes. In fact, the raging fire demolished the three-storied building and turned it into rubble,” the High Court had noted in the judgment.

“We have seen senselessness of violence and loss of innocent human lives. We cannot imagine the pain suffered by the victims who perished in the raging fire. We cannot judge the depth of sorrow and despair of their families… This phenomena which we often describe as communal frenzy turn perfectly normal human beings momentarily into murderous monsters leaving nothing but a trail of death and destruction for the victims and his own family alike,” the court had observed.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lfvbti/article30673307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-MANAS-Attn-Mr-PKS-and-NewsG1U3NF2S5110THSARDARPURAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-grants-bail-to-17-convicts-in-2002-sardarpura-post-godhra-riots-case/article30673268.ece
82,2020/01/28,Protests against Citizenship Amendment Act will continue: Sitaram Yechury,"Equating the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) to the opposition to the Emergency in 1975, CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury recalled that despite Emergency having been approved by Parliament, his party had chosen to oppose it and said the mere fact that the CAA had been passed by Parliament doesn’t change the party’s stand.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Yechury said those arguing that the CAA cannot be questioned because it had been endorsed by Parliament must also remember that the Emergency too had been cleared by Parliament.

“While we opposed it, fought and restored democracy, some belonging to the present ruling party also joined. Were they wrong then? Government must listen to the people and take back CAA, NRC & NPR,” Mr. Yechury tweeted.

The CPI(M) and the Communist Party of India (CPI) are set to hold a strategy meeting on Wednesday to discuss the current political situation and the Left’s role in it. They will also be discussing on how to take forward the protests.

“We opposed CAA in Parliament. We moved for saying yes to persecuted persons, from all neighbouring countries, of any religion. What we opposed in Parliament will also be opposed on the streets. That’s democracy,” he said. Mr. Yechury added that the “divide and rule” policy practised by the BJP and the RSS was aimed at dividing Indians on the basis of clothes, food, gender, faith and other fault lines they created. “But what unites India more now is the damaged economy: BJP’s assault on lives and livelihoods,” he said.

83,2020/01/28,SC fixes 10-day period for hearing issues of discrimination against women at religious places,"Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on Tuesday informed the Supreme Court that lawyers had been unable to reach a consensus about framing questions for a nine-judge Bench led by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde to examine in connection with the scope of judicial review when religious faith and women’s equality were at odds as in the Sabarimala case.

Mr. Mehta, during an oral mentioning, suggested the court frame the larger issues involved.

On Tuesday, Chief Justice Bobde responded that the issues would not be allowed to be too broad-based and final arguments in the case should be made pointedly without digressions. The CJI indicated that lawyers would have to complete their submissions in 10 days.

On January 13, when the nine-judge Bench assembled, the CJI had asked lawyers involved in the case to hold a conference on January 17 to reframe/add issues to be examined by the nine-judge Bench. The court had posted the case for hearing after three weeks.

The nine-judge Bench had clarified that it would not be restricted to the Sabarimala women entry case but would examine “larger issues” of law arising from practices such as the prohibition of women from entering mosques and temples, female genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohras and the ban on Parsi women who married inter-faith from entering the fire temple.

Chief Justice Bobde had explained that the basis of the Bench’s judicial enquiry would be seven questions referred to a larger Bench by a five-judge Bench on November 14, 2019. He said the nine-judge Bench was only examining propositions of law raised about religious practices believed to be essential to various religions. The Bench would not go into the individual facts of the various petitions before it.

“We will decide questions of law on women’s entry to mosques/temples, genital mutilation by Dawoodi Bohras, entry of Parsi women who marry outside their community into fire temple. We will not decide individual facts of each case,” Chief Justice Bobde had told lawyers in the courtroom.

On November 14 last year, a five-judge Bench led by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, instead of deciding the Sabarimala review entrusted to it, sought an “authoritative pronouncement” on the Court’s power to decide the essentiality of religious practices. Framing seven questions, the Bench referred them to a seven-judge Bench. These referral questions included whether “essential religious practices” be afforded constitutional protection under Article 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs).

Chief Justice Bobde, who succeeded Justice Gogoi, formed a Bench of nine rather than seven judges to examine these questions which concern multiple faiths.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/co0nkt/article30636231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24TH-SUPREME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-fixes-10-day-period-for-hearing-issues-of-discrimination-against-women-at-religious-places/article30672808.ece

85,2020/01/28,Rajnath says SAARC’s full potential not utilised due to a single country,"India was playing a lead role on connectivity in the South Asian region but the full potential of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) was not utilised because of the behaviour of a single country, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said, in a reference to Pakistan, on Tuesday.

“South Asia is at a critical juncture of history. We should not hold regional prosperity hostage to the interests of states who are obstructing all efforts aimed at regional cooperation. Our intra-regional trade has been abysmally low. We have to transcend these limitations,” Mr. Singh said at the12th South Asia Conference organised by the Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses on “India’s ‘Neighbourhood First’ Policy: Regional Perceptions.”

“All of you are aware how it [a neighbouring nation] stalled the SAARC motor vehicles agreement at the last Kathmandu session in 2015”, he said. SAARC could not hold a formal meet in the last four years due to the tensions between India and Pakistan.

India has committed about $13.14 billion in credit lines and about $4 billion in assistance in the neighbourhood over the last decade. The true pathway to regional peace and security lay in understanding each other's sensitivities and following the “basic principles of non-interference in each other's Internal affairs.”

Mr. Singh lashed out at Pakistan, saying that it had preferred to use terrorism as a state policy towards India, rather than peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue. “Use of terror as an instrument of its foreign and security policy has promoted radicalism and terrorism in the region”.

Mr. Singh said it was essential that terrorists and their ideological and financial network were cut off and that they did not receive state support. “With the exception of Pakistan, our region has adhered to these principles.” India was engaged in conversations with its neighbours with one exception, in order to develop a joint approach for regional peace and security. “It's important that we unite in our efforts to defeat terrorism,” he noted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vsk8mv/article30672747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28RAJNATHSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/full-potential-of-saarc-not-utilised-due-to-single-country-rajnath/article30672748.ece

So far we have picked up 20 samples from those with history of travel to China and those showing symptoms and none have come positive.

88,2020/01/28,Supreme Court adjourns hearing of curative plea in Bhopal gas case,"A five-judge Constitution Bench on Tuesday adjourned the hearing of a curative petition filed by the government for enhanced compensation to Bhopal gas tragedy victims after one of the judges withdrew from the case.

Justice S. Ravindra Bhat recused from the case as he had appeared for the government in the case in the past.

The government is seeking compensation, over and above the $470 million already paid by Union Carbide.

The Constitution Bench is led by Justice Arun Mishra and the other judges include Justices Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, M.R. Shah and Justice Bhat. Following Justice Bhat’s recusal, Justice Mishra said the CJI would take a decision on the future course to be taken. “We are awaiting the CJI’s orders,” Justice Mishra addressed the assembled lawyers.

In January last year, a Bench led by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had agreed to examine the petition.

The government had contended that the compensation, determined in 1989, was arrived at on assumptions of truth unrelated to realities.

A five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court had in 2011 issued notice to the Union Carbide Corporation, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Chemicals Co., U.S.; Dow Chemicals ; McLeod Russel India, Kolkata, and Eveready Industries, Kolkata.

Additional funds

The Centre had sought a re-look of the May 4, 1989 and subsequent October 3, 1991 orders of the Supreme Court, contending that the 1989 settlement was seriously impaired.

The government has sought additional funds of over ₹7,400 crore from the pesticide company.

The tragedy unfolded in Bhopal (in the State of Madhya Pradesh) on the night intervening night of December 2-3,1984 when the highly dangerous and toxic gas, Methyl Isocynate (MIC), escaped from the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL). It resulted in the death of 5,295 human beings, injuries to almost 5,68,292 persons besides loss of livestock and loss of property of almost 5,478 persons.

The court has already dismissed a curative petition filed by the CBI in 2010 for enhancement of punishment.

The agency had filed the curative petition to correct the Supreme Court’s “colossal failure of justice” in 1996 when it chose to dismiss the 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy as a result of an act of negligence, and not culpable homicide, by former Union Carbide chairman Warren Anderson and his Indian employees. Anderson died in 2014.

Plea dismissed

Dismissing the curative plea in 2011, the court had held that “no satisfactory explanation has been given to file such curative petitions after about 14 years from the 1996 judgment.”

The CBI wanted the Supreme Court to “restore” the criminal charge of Section 304 Part II IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against the accused. It approached the Supreme Court facing public outcry over a Bhopal court order that sentenced Union Carbide executives to two years’ imprisonment. Those convicted included former Union Carbide India chairman Keshub Mahindra.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eze8s1/article30653886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-THGRP-COURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bhopal-gas-tragedy-justice-s-ravindra-bhat-recuses-from-hearing-centres-plea-for-additional-fund/article30672538.ece
89,2020/01/28,Air India jumbo plane ready for evacuation of Indians from Wuhan,"Flag carrier Air India has kept one of its 423-seater jumbo plane ready in Mumbai for the evacuation of Indian citizens from Wuhan province in China in the wake of Cornovirus outbreak in the East Asian country, an official source said on Tuesday.

The airline is awaiting necessary approvals from the ministries of External Affairs and Health to operate the special evacuation flight, the source said.

The decision follows the government instructions to various ministries to take steps to deal with the issue.

“We have kept a Boeing 747-400 ready in Mumbai to operate an evacuation flight to China whenever we get a go ahead from the government,” the source said.

Some 250 Indians are to be evacuated, the source said, adding, “we are awaiting clearances from Ministry of External Affairs and also from Health Ministry. The Health Ministry’s nod is required because the operating crew has to fly in a virus outbreak territory.”

At the Cabinet Secretary meeting on Monday, the government decided that steps may be taken to prepare for the possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan.

Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus in China is a novel strain and not seen before.

The outbreak has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).

Accordingly, Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities while the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry of Health will make arrangements for transport and quarantine facilities respectively, an official release had said on Monday.

Government also asked the Civil Aviation Ministry to issue instruction to airlines for managing and notifying anybody reporting illness on all direct and indirect flight to China besides facilitating in-flight announcements and distribution of health cards to all flights with direct or indirect connectivity to China.

Officials said Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities for evacuation of Indian nationals, mostly students, stuck in Wuhan city.

“It was decided that steps may be taken to prepare for possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan. Accordingly, Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities,” a government statement said.

Wuhan along 12 other cities have been completely sealed by the Chinese authorities to stop the virus from spreading. The death toll climbed to 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases.

Over 250 to 300 Indian students are reportedly stuck in Wuhan triggering concerns over their well-being.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/b9zurs/article30672489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28INDIA-AIRINDIASALE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/air-india-jumbo-plane-ready-for-evacuation-of-indians-from-wuhan/article30672490.ece

The device was installed by officials of Myanmar’s Health Department at Namphalong market on the Myanmarese side of the border, the official based in Moreh said.

“The installation was prompted by an alarming spread of the virus which originated from China’s Wuhan city,” he said.

91,2020/01/28,GRSE set to deliver INS Kavaratti to Navy soon,"Adding to Indian Navy’s firepower, Defence PSU Garden Reach Shibuilders and Engineers (GRSE) is set to deliver anti-submarine warfare stealth corvette INS Kavaratti to the Navy soon, its Chairman-cum-Managing Director Rear Admiral V.K. Saxena said.

‘Kavaratti’ is the last of the four Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) stealth corvettes built by the GRSE for the Indian Navy under Project P28, he said. “All trials of the ship have been successfully completed, and we plan to deliver it by the end of this month,” Saxena told PTI here. ‘Kavaratti’ will be the 104th ship to be constructed and delivered by the GRSE, he said.

With a displacement of 3,300 tonnes, the ship has a carbon composite superstructure, which has been flawlessly integrated with the steel hull through technology developed by the GRSE.

“The carbon composite superstructure provides advangate of a lower weight of the warship, thus increasing its stability, manoeuvrability and faster acceleration,” Saxena said.

The new technology will mean that the warship, which has 90% indigenous components, will also require lower maintenance, he said.

The ship is equipped to fight in nuclear, chemical and biological warfare conditions and its weapons and sensors suite is predominantly indigenous, according to Defence sources.

The first of the four ASW stealth corvettes under Project P28 - ‘Kamorta’, was delivered to the Navy in July 2014, ‘Kadmatt’ was delivered in November, 2015 and ’Kiltan’ was delivered in October 2017, a GRSE official said.

All these four corvettes under the project are named after islands in the Lakshadweep archipelago in the Arabian Sea, he said.

The GRSE currently has a strong order book position of around ₹27,400 crore under which there are a total of 19 warships at various stages of construction under six projects that are underway, the official said.

Of these, five projects are of the Indian Navy and one is of the Indian Coast Guard.

The Defence PSU has delivered five warships to Indian Navy in last 10 months, between March 2019 and December 2019, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fakwqg/article30672002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IndianNavylogo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/grse-set-to-deliver-ins-kavaratti-to-navy-soon/article30672003.ece
92,2020/01/28,Widows of farm suicide victims demand rehab package in Union Budget,"When P. Kalyani’s husband committed suicide last year, he left her with a debt of ₹4 lakh and two teenage daughters to take care of. The death of the tenant farmer in the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh was one of the 3.5 lakh farmer suicides that have taken place in the country since 1995, according to the National Crime Records Bureau data. However, Kalyani did not get any of the compensation money or benefits that the State offers to support farmer suicide families.

“We did not own any land. My husband used to lease three acres to cultivate. But they said we were not farmers since we did not own any farmland, so I was not eligible for the benefits,” said Kalyani, speaking at a national consultation organised by the Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch and UN Women on Monday. Left with no pension or ex gratia support, she works as an agricultural labourer to support her family.

At a time of severe agricultural distress in many parts of the country, women from farmer suicide families are demanding that the upcoming Union Budget announce a comprehensive rehabilitation package for them, including ₹7 lakh ex gratia and a pension of ₹5,000 per month. Currently, government support varies from ₹1 to 7 lakh in different States. However, only a fraction of families actually gets support, as many States do not recognise tenant farmers and agricultural labourers as cases of farm suicide.

“Maharashtra has had the highest number of farm suicide cases, according to NCRB data. There have been 70,000 cases in the last 25 years. But only about 30% of them have received benefits,” said Seema Kulkarni of MAKAAM Maharashtra. “The Revenue department has specific conditions for beneficiaries: they must own farmland, they should have taken an institutional loan from a bank and they should have suffered crop failure in that year. This does not recognise the cumulative nature of the agricultural debt crisis in India, nor does it recognise that many cultivators do not own land and do not have access to institutional credit, but take loans from informal moneylenders.”

Even women who meet these conditions are often made to run from pillar to post to show evidence of their eligibility to receive benefits. “In Telangana, there are 13 types of certificates required to apply for the ex gratia benefit,” said Ashalatha Satyam of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika.

“Another issue is that creditors push widows for the repayment of debts that caused the deaths of their husbands. In the majority of cases, the ex gratia payment is entirely used to pay off debts, leaving the family with no support in a time of need. There should be a mechanism for settlement of the existing debt.” Even if the deceased man owned land, the land title is often not inherited by his widow, she added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/widows-of-farm-suicide-victims-demand-rehab-package-in-union-budget/article30670024.ece
93,2020/01/28,Kishor embarrasses NDA again,"Prashant Kishor, a leader of the Janata Dal(United), which is an ally of the BJP, on Monday again caused embarrassment to the alliance, while responding to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s comments on the Delhi Assembly election.

“EVM buttons will be pressed with just love in Delhi on February 8. It should be a big jolt, with mild current, so that brotherhood and friendship is not endangered,” Mr. Kishor, a national vice-president of the JD(U), wrote on Twitter, in reaction to Mr. Shah’s comments at a meeting in Delhi. “When you press the button [on the electronic voting machine] on February 8, do so with such anger that its current is felt at Shaheen Bagh,” Mr. Shah had said, referring to the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Of late, Mr. Kishor has been taking on the BJP and JD(U) president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar over the CAA and a pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC). A few days ago, he released an old video on his Twitter handle, in which senior BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi was heard attacking Mr. Nitish Kumar. In turn, BJP and JD(U) leaders have called Mr. Kishor “a power broker and businessman”.

Sources say Mr. Kishor has not been invited to a meeting of JD(U) leaders scheduled for Tuesday at Mr. Nitish Kumar’s official residence in Patna to discuss strategies for the Assembly election due in October-November. Mr. Nitish Kumar is expected to take a decision at the meeting on Mr. Kishor and Pawan Varma, another JD(U) leader, who has questioned the party’s alliance with the BJP for the Assembly election.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pfwjk5/article30402577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kishorejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kishor-embarrasses-nda-again/article30668806.ece
94,2020/01/28,Congress to raise CAA-NRC-NPR in Budget session,"The Congress on Monday identified the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) among the principal issues that it will raise in the budget session of Parliament, which begins on Friday.

A meeting of the Congress Strategy Group, held at party president Sonia Gandhi’s residence, also identified the state of the economy, including the growing unemployment and rising inflation, as the other key issues.

On Friday, Congress MPs would protest in front of the Mahatma Gandhi statue against the CAA-NRC-NPR as the party alleged that these measures sought to take away a citizen’s constitutional rights and guarantees. It will also raise the issue of police action against the protesting students across universities.

The party will, however, attend the President’s address to the joint sitting of Parliament in the first session of 2020.

Though a senior leader also discussed the government’s plan to construct a new Parliament building, Ms. Gandhi is learn to have told her colleagues to raise issues that resonated with the public.

Among those who attended the meeting were Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, senior leaders Anand Sharma, K. Suresh, Jairam Ramesh and Manish Tewari.

The Congress has also decided to bring back the narrative to bread-and- butter issues such as employment and rising food inflation with which the people, especially the youth, could identify.

Rally in Jaipur

On Tuesday, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi will address the youth in Jaipur at the ‘Yuva Akrosh’ (Youth Anger) rally where the focus would be on jobs and education.

Jobs lost

“The reality of all the big promises to create jobs. More than 3.5 crore jobs lost in the seven key sectors of the economy...That's why the government hesitates to speak on employment,” Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted in Hindi.

In the run-up to the Budget, the party also announced that it would hold special press conferences to seek answers from the government on key economic parameters. “As a responsible Opposition party, the Congress intends to shift the narrative back to the economy... The Union Budget 2020-21 is being presented at a time when we are already deep into a slowdown. Even though the government may be in a denial mode, Indian economy is on the verge of slipping from stagnation into stagflation,” Congress spokesperson Supriya Srinate said at a briefing.

95,2020/01/28,AI sale offer a desperate attempt to meet revenue shortfall: Opposition,"The Opposition parties slammed the Narendra Modi government's fresh bid to sell Air India, saying it was an attempt to meet the revenue shortfall by “selling family silver” without actually fixing the fundamental issues in the sector.

A fresh Expression of Interest (EOI) was issued on Monday, putting 100 per cent stake of Air India on sale. This is an improvement from the last EOI when only 75 per cent of stake was offered.

“The proposed sale of Air India is nothing but a desperate attempt to try and meet the revenue shortfall by selling family silver. There is no empirical evidence to show that the private airlines have performed better than the government ones,” Congress Lok Sabha member and party spokesperson Manish Tewari told The Hindu.

Quoting from a reply filed by the government in the Lok Sabha to a question put by him, Mr Tewari said, “The government had admitted to Parliament that since the open skies of 1992, 23 private airlines have closed down. Recently, you have the spectre of Jet Airways going belly up. Even Vistara airlines is posting a humongous quarter on quarter loss.” There are “serious structural issues” in the aviation industry, which the government was completely and absolutely incapable of dealing with.

By selling Air India, the government was only trying to profit the corporate world. “This sale of Air India is nothing but a crude attempt at selling valuable public assets for deep discounts to obviously favoured oligarchs with the intent of bridging revenue shortfall and I do hope for no extraneous reasons,” Mr. Tewari said.

There was need for a transparent valuation of Air India before it was put for sale. “Air India is a five lakh crore company and any attempts to sell it off must be preceded by a proper valuation, whereby the method of valuation and the quantum at which it is valued should be properly disclosed,” he said.

Swamy against sale

BJP MP Subramanian Swamy, in a tweet, said that he could move court against the sale. “This deal is wholly anti-national and I will be forced to go to court. We cannot sell our family silver,” Mr. Swamy said.

Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri said Mr. Swamy's opinion is purely personal and not shared by the government.

The Left also strongly opposed the move. Communist Party of India's general secretary D. Raja said that till now the government was indiscriminately selling the public sector units and now following the same trend, it was selling infrastructure too. He accused the government of treating public assets as their own. “If there is some problem then it's with the administration of Air India. If it can be streamlined then it can be converted into a globally acclaimed airline. This government is committed to serving the interests of corporate houses,” he alleged.

Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha floor leader Derek O' Brien posted a video message on Twitter just minutes before boarding an Air India flight. “The government has decided to sell more family silver by selling 100 per cent stake in Air India. You can well imagine how bad the economy that more family silver being sold,” he said.

The Chairmanship of the Standing Committee on Tourism, Transport and Culture, which also studies the aviation sector, was taken away simply because of his party's opposition to sale of Air India, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2o50mi/article30662854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRINDIA-STAKESALETHNAKa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ai-sale-offer-a-desperate-attempt-to-meet-revenue-shortfall-opposition/article30667116.ece
96,2020/01/28,Onion production to grow 7% this year despite kharif crop losses,"The Centre has projected a 7% rise in onion production for the current crop year, despite the fact that 25% of the kharif crop was destroyed, resulting in sky-high onion prices through the winter.

Releasing its first advance estimates for 2019-20 (July-June), the Agriculture Ministry said onion production is likely to touch 24.45 million tonnes, an increase from the 22.82 million tonnes produced in the previous year.

The kharif or summer crop was damaged by the twin impacts of a delayed monsoon and excess rainfall in the key producer States Maharashtra and Karnataka. The acute supply shortage resulted in retail prices above the ₹100 per kg mark in major metros through much of December. To tame the prices, the Centre imported onions from Egypt and Turkey. However, most Indian consumers did not like the taste of the imported onions, which reached markets at the same time just as Indian farmers began harvesting the early rabi crop, resulting in prices dropping to ₹60 per kg from peaks of ₹180/kg.

Increased acreage

The Agriculture Ministry data showed that farmers have planted an increased acreage this year, sowing onions in 12.93 lakh hectares. Given the losses of the kharif crop, much of the increased production for the year will come from the kharif crop, which could lead to a supply glut later this year.

Overall, vegetable production is set to rise 2.6% this year with most of the growth coming from onions, potatoes (3.5%) and tomatoes (1.7%).

However, fruit production is expected to fall 2.3% this year, mostly due to lower production of grapes, bananas, mangoes, citrus fruits, papayas and pomegranates.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ngnvba/article30669693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB21ONION1-28jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/onion-production-to-grow-7-this-year-despite-kharif-crop-losses/article30669659.ece
97,2020/01/28,Tribals start protest in Ganjam against rejection of pleas for land rights,"More than 2,000 tribal people took out a march and started a protest in front of the Collectorate at Chhatrapur in Odisha’s Ganjam district on Monday against what they called the arbitrary rejection of their applications for land rights.

The protesters have been brought together by the All India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha, the Adivasi Bharat Mahasabha, the Ganjam Zilla Adivasi Manch and the Ganjam Zilla Gramsabha Samukhya. They said 13,851 applications for land rights under the Forest Rights Act had been cancelled in the whole of Odisha, and the number included 6,613 in Ganjam (3,346 from tribals and 2,967 from forest dwellers).

All India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha national secretary Bhala Chandra Sarangi said the administration did not inform the families of the reasons for rejection of their applications.

“We demand that all cancelled applications be returned to gram sabhas for scrutiny and verification, and the administration should clear the applications approved by gram sabhas,” Ganjam Zilla Gramsabha Samukhya leader Bijay Kumar Swain said.

Their other demands are an immediate survey to recognise the habitats of forest dwellers as revenue villages; land rights to forest dwellers for agriculture and housing; and recovery of the forest land under the “illegal possession” of the rich in different regions. They are also against the auction of cashew orchards near tribal villages to non-tribals, and want the ownership of the orchards handed to the tribals.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4ft54m/article30669720.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200127-WA0004,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tribals-start-protest-in-ganjam-against-rejection-of-pleas-for-land-rights/article30669721.ece
98,2020/01/28,Amnesty for obscure outfit raises eyebrows,"More than 600 members of eight extremist groups in Assam gave up arms at an official programme on January 23, but one of them — the National Liberation Front of Bengalis (NLFB) — has raised eyebrows.

Reports quoting people in districts such as Baksa and Chirang in western Assam said many of the 301 surrendered members of the “little-known” NLFB were petty traders or minor craftsmen such as carpenters.

This has led to questions regarding the so-called “surrender drama” and of the members of “equally obscure” outfits such as the National Santhal Liberation Army and the Adivashi Dragon Fighters who allegedly laid down arms.

However, Assam police officials claimed that there was nothing fishy about these organisations and questions regarding their existence could be attributed to the general tendency of downplaying militancy associated with certain communities.

Officials admitted that Bengali militancy has not been as intense or violent as that of other ethnic groups in Assam.

“What can we do if a few choose to ignore or belittle us? It is true that most of us are into petty trade, farming, carpentry, masonry and other activities. But we underwent training for these under a rehabilitation package in 2018, four years after initiating talks with former Director General of Police Khagen Sarma and even meeting former Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi. Isn’t it better to work for a living honourably than resorting to extortion and burglary?” Amarjit Paul, chairman of the now-disbanded NLFB told The Hindu in Chirang district.

Mr Paul said their group was formed with 22 people in December 2010 to demand a council for the Bengali people and end the victimisation of the community. “We have newspaper clippings of subversive activities such as carrying out the Kamakhya Express (train) blast in 2010 as proof of our existence,” he added.

The NLFB, according to intelligence reports, took off when the Bengali Tiger Force (BTF) became defunct. The BTF was formed in December 1996 with Subhash Chandra Sarkar as its chairman and worked in tandem with the disbanded Bodo Liberation Tigers but all its 325 members surrendered in August 1999.

“Our membership from across seven districts swelled to more than 300. Most of us surrendered while a few went their way,” Mr. Paul claimed.

Hiren Nath, the Inspector General of Police (Special Branch) and head of the rehabilitation programme called Swabalamban said some 1,800 surrendered extremist have been given training and 1,200 of them provided with ₹1 lakh to engage in income-generating activities.

“The authenticity of the cadres is verified by the district superintendents of police and other security agencies over a period of time. Then there is a multi-agency Screening Committee which carries out further checks. All the NLFB cadres and the others came through that process,” he said.

“You may ask why 644 militants surrendered 177 firearms. The 50 members of the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent deposited only 24 firearms. One has to understand that not all members of an outfit are fighters; some are couriers, some linkmen, others in the political wing,” Mr Nath said.

A defence officer, declining to be quoted, said the NLFB members had to be brought to the mainstream as they had formed a group, underwent training and had weapons. But he admitted “two-three people” who work on the periphery or had cursory association with extremist groups do get benefits.

“What is the harm if some youth, whom the government cannot give jobs, get a stipend through the rehabilitation programme and start a livelihood? The ultimate goal is to fight unemployment,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gv0ht6/article30669694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200127-WA0023,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amnesty-for-obscure-outfit-raises-eyebrows/article30669695.ece

A five-bed isolation ward with ventilator and other facilities would be set up in every teaching and district hospital in the State. In addition, a nodal officer is being appointed to monitor the situation.

Medical and Health Minister Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas held a review meeting on the coronavirus, at the Secretariat on Tuesday.

The Minister said that not a single case of novel coronavirus had been reported in the State till date. The government was keeping a strict vigil, and people need not panic. Medical and health officials were asked to be on high alert and work in accordance with Central government guidelines, he added.

Strict vigil

When contacted, Principal Secretary (Health and Family Welfare) K. S. Jawahar Reddy said screening facilities were being set up at all ports for crew and passengers. Also, coordination with the authorities at the Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai international airport terminals had been established for tracking passengers from China who were headed for Andhra Pradesh, he said.

Though the passengers were not showing symptoms, they were being monitored for 28 days from the time of arrival as a precautionary measure. “If at all any passenger shows any symptom, he / she will be admitted in the isolation ward established at GHCCD and KGH, Visakhapatnam,” he said.

An advisory and technical guidance documents of WHO had been already communicated to all districts. Screening for incoming international passengers at the Visakhapatnam airport had already begun.

After meeting farmers in the capital region, NAPM leaders P. Chennaiah, Meera Sanghamitra and B. Ramakrishna Raju said the government, while designing development projects, should not lose sight of key factors like adherence to democratic norms, transparency and protection to environment.

They said Mr. Naidu did not place in the public domain the Sivaramakrishnan Committee report for an open discussion and also circumvented the provisions of the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (LARR Act).

Referring to the proposed shifting of the capital, the NAPM leaders said Visakhapatnam was a reasonably developed city, already stressed by population and pollution. Water crisis and environmental concerns run contrary to the government’s decentralisation plan.

They said the government plans should not hurt the interests of farmers and farm labour, should not result in displacement of people and loss of livelihoods and environment.

The leaders also condemned ‘police excesses’ on the protesting farmers of Amaravati region.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dont-repeat-naidus-mistakes-napm-tells-jagan/article30678053.ece
102,2020/01/28,Anantapur gearing up following coronavirus alert: DM&HO,"The Medical and Health Department officers in Anantapur are taking necessary precautionary measures, following an alert sounded by the health ministry both at the Centre and the State level on the spread of the deadly Novel Coronavirus (nCoV). However, there was nothing to feel scared about the situation as they would only be increasing vigil as part of preventive measures, they said.

“One case of a student travelling from China to Visakhapatnam has been recorded and he has been kept under observation by following all laid down procedures. His nasal and throat swabs have been sent to the immunology laboratory in Pune,” DM&HO K.V.N.S. Anil Kumar told The Hindu. Confirmation comes only after 14 days as the symptoms of the nCoV might appear within two days or after 14 days of exposure, he observed. As of now there is no testing facility in Andhra Pradesh, he said.

Respiratory problem

It was an upper respiratory system problem and the symptoms were similar to other viral infections of the respiratory tract, hence if any person with persistent fever, cough and shortness of breath was found, he or she should be referred to the GGH. However, the first criterion for suspicion was primary travel from infected regions of the world.

All suspicious cases with travel record from China, or getting in contact with confirmed nCoV patients would be monitored by taking the throat and nasal swabs and symptomatically managing the manifestations, Dr. Kumar said. As of now only airports and seaports were the compulsory screening points.

For Anantapur district a suspected case had to come from either Hyderabad, Bengaluru or Mumbai airports, where they anyway get screened at the first point of contact as per the national health ministry norms if they are travelling from the regions that have suspected/confirmed cases of nCoV, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/anantapur-gearing-up-following-coronavirus-alert-dmho/article30678042.ece

Information and Public Relations Minister Perni Nani told The Hindu on Tuesday, “The State Cabinet decided to create a new district, namely Machilipatnam, that will comprise the entire jurisdiction of the Machilipatnam Lok Sabha constituency. The entire Eastern Krishna district will soon become the new district.”

“The Cabinet has taken the decision of creating the new district by bifurcating the Krishna district on grounds of the administrative convenience.

106,2020/01/28,Talent fest makes Sanskrit varsity a melting pot of diverse cultures,"The campus of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha (RSVP) was a melting pot of disparate cultures, educational backgrounds and traditions here on Tuesday, as the varsity celebrated 14th All India Sanskrit Students Talent Festival 2020.

As many as 400 students from 32 Sanskrit institutions are taking part, resembling a ‘Mini Bharat’. Right from Jammu to Ernakulam and Pune to Kolkata, the pan-India presence of budding Sanskrit scholars made it a lively event.

Vidyapeetha’s Chancellor and former Chief Election Commissioner N. Gopalaswami formally inaugurated the event along with Indira Gandhi National Centre for Arts (IGNCA) member secretary Sachidanand Joshi.

Speaking at the event, Mr. Joshi said, “Sanskrit will always remain an authoritative representative of great Indian heritage and culture,” he said and appealed to the students of Sanskrit to not limit themselves to teaching jobs but also consider pursuing research in oriental scriptures and make its essence available to the future generations.

“Modern education will remain in certificates, but Sanskrit universities are the real custodians of science,” he said.

Mr. Gopalaswami, a Padma Bhushan awardee, recalled the efforts of the former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee in launching the National Manuscripts Mission (NMM), which was considered a giant leap in deciphering the science hidden in palm leaf manuscripts.

He also explained that the Vidyapeetha had taken up the task of providing commentaries to the five great ‘Kavyas’ in a simplified manner. Vice-Chancellor V. Muralidhara Sharma said that the event would create an identity of ‘oneness’ among all the Sanskrit students in the country.

In a chat with reporters at a plantation programme launched at Peda Rushikonda by Pragathi Bharat Foundation, a newly formed NGO, he said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was committed to ensuring decentralised development by creating Executive capital in Visakhapatnam, Judicial capital in Kurnool and Legislative capital in Amaravati.

Scoffing at Opposition criticism over decision on three capitals, he blamed them for politicking everything without caring for development of the State, he came down heavily on BJP Rajya Sabha member Y.S. Choudary for his outburst over the decision to create three capitals.

To a question, he made it very clear that he was not aware of BJP government’s opposition to the move and remarked that Mr. Chowdary was opposing the decision as he had invested in lands at Amaravati.

108,2020/01/28,"Move on Council abolition a hasty one, says Ganta","Former Minister and TDP MLA of Visakha North Ganta Srinivasa Rao has said that the State government took the decision to abolish the Legislative Council out of anger as the Council referred the two Bills on decentralisation and repeal of CRDA to the select committee.

Speaking to the media after a review meeting with leaders in his constituency on Tuesday, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said, “The Council was revived by former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy after a lot of thought and now his son decided to abolish it just because a couple Bills passed by the Assembly have not been approved by it.”

He also said the process of dissolving it time consuming. “There are many such requests pending with Parliament and AP will not be given priority,” he said. In the long run, the YSR Congress would have anyway got its majority in the Council and in such a case, the move was a hasty one.

Refuting the allegations made by the YSRCP that the TDP had put pressure on the Chairman of the Council, Mohammed Ahmed Shariff, to refer the Bills to the select committee, he said, “The Chairman has acted according to democratic norms.”

Capital shift

About the move to shift the Capital, he said that there was uncertainty over it and the exact time cannot be specified. Moreover, the court also has cautioned the government on it.

He, however, pointed out that the TDP leaders of North Coastal Andhra welcomed the idea of establishing the Executive capital in Vizag, but the final decision rests with the party high-command.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a50cpd/article30681118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29ONGGANTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/move-on-council-abolition-a-hasty-one-says-ganta/article30676457.ece
109,2020/01/28,‘Embargo on Net deprivesJ&K youth of LIC jobs’,"Embargo on Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir has seriously impacted the recruitment process. Immediately after the abrogation of Article 370 in August last, the Union Government stopped Internet services in the valley.

Some time in August-September last, LIC announced recruitment drive for about 8,000 assistants across India, with 124 posts being earmarked for Jammu and Kashmir. But, due to lack of Internet services the youth from the valley were unable to apply, said A.K. Bhatnagar, vice-president (north) of All India Insurance Employees’ Association.

As there was no Internet, the qualified aspirants were not able to apply and only one person could secure a job out of 124 posts. The other posts were filled by people from other States, said Mohammed Ali Tantare, Jammu and Kashmir (division) president of AIIEA. Both of them were addressing a press conference at the ongoing 25th general conference of All India Insurance Employees’ Association here on Tuesday.

According to K. Venugopal, all India vice-president of AIEEA, a resolution was passed at the conference to protect the civil rights of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

Move opposed

Mr. Venugopal said another resolution was also passed to oppose the Union government’s move to privatise LIC. “LIC is the only PSU that is competing with 22 private companies and despite that it enjoys a share of 74% when it comes to premium and 76 % in polices.”

“LIC has over 46 crore policy holders, the largest in the world and it generates to the tune of ₹4 lakh crore in the shape of premium. This amount is in the hands of the government and can be utilised for development. But despite that the government is planning to disinvest LIC,” said Mr. Venugopal.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/embargo-on-net-deprivesjk-youth-of-lic-jobs/article30676436.ece
110,2020/01/28,CITU leader slams Centre on disinvestment,"Further disinvestment of public sector units will be the worst thing to happen in the Indian economy. Privatisation or disinvestment will ruin the indigenous manufacturing sector and will force the economy to depend on foreign funding, according to CITU general secretary Tapan Sen. He was addressing a session on the second day of the 25th general conference of All India Insurance Employees’ Association at AU Convention Centre on Tuesday.

Criticising the government for proposing disinvestment in LIC, he said, “What justification does the government have to list LIC in the stock exchange. LIC is a self-generating company and contributes largely to the national exchequer.”

During the earlier disinvestment era, when no private companies had come forward to buy stakes in PSUs, it was LIC that had invested in those companies, he said. “There is an economic slowdown and the market is squeezed up. But instead of pumping in more money to increase the purchasing power of the people, the Central government is on withdrawal mode.”

When about ₹5.82 lakh crore still remain unpaid from corporate and direct taxes, ironically, the Union government has reduced the corporate tax from 40% to 22% just to benefit a few corporate companies, he pointed out.

Call for alternative

Mr. Sen said that time has come to propose and popularise an alternative policy and trade unions have a role to play. “Working class should rise and assert its intellectuality and develop a credible alternative platform.”

Talking about CAA, he said that it would polarise the people of the country. “The government has said that enumeration for CAA and NPR will begin from April 1, and it is time that the trade unions create awareness about the Act and urge people not to assist enumerators,” said Mr. Sen.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/xqweoy/article30676417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29ONGLIIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/citu-leader-slams-centre-on-disinvestment/article30676418.ece
111,2020/01/28,Decentralisation will spread development in State: YSRCP,"Decentralisation of development is the only panacea for backwardness, underdevelopment and inequality pervading our society, said YSRCP leader Lella Appireddy.

“Decentralisation will spread development to all parts of the State. Look at Guntur, an educational hub in the State. Is it not because students are denied quality education in their towns and villages? Why development should lay centred in one region?’’ Mr. Appireddy questioned at the workshop held with students at Masterminds CA Academy.

Mr. Appireddy had organised similar seminars in the last two weeks in support of decentralisation of development and the three capitals idea mooted by Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy.

“Decentralisation is not just an idea, but it will be taken up in a mission mode by the government. The backward North Coastal region and the Rayalaseema region will be developed, and Guntur-Krishna region will remain close to the heart of the CM and our party. Agri-centric industries will come up in this region, irrigation facilities would be spruced up in Rayalaseema region while Visakhapatnam will be developed as a financial and administrative hub of the State,” said Mr. Appireddy.

The meeting was attended by students of different colleges, teachers and party members.

Further, decentralisation would open up opportunities for all sections and the State would reap the benefits in the long run, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tfipco/article30675993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29-VJ-APPIREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/decentralisation-will-spread-development-in-state-ysrcp/article30675994.ece
112,2020/01/28,Police to take message on POCSO to rural areas through Gram Sabhas,"In view of the rising atrocities and incidents of sex-related crimes against children, the police department in Tirupati has decided to take the message on Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act to the rural areas by conducting Gram Sabhas.

At a meeting to review the performance of ‘Mahila Mitra’ in the Tirupati Urban police district here on Tuesday, Additional Superintendent of Police (Admin) Anil Babu called the Disha Act a path-breaking initiative and said the cases of sexual assault should be dealt with on a priority basis and with minimum mental disturbance to the victim.

‘Change in mindset needed’

On the change in perspective required in the department while dealing with such sensitive cases, Women’s Initiatives (WINS) secretary R. Meera appealed to the cops to break the stereotype and initiate affirmative action on the culprit, instead of pinning the blame on victim.

“In many cases, the victims are heckled at by the police with a ‘you invited the trouble’ attitude, referring to their attire and social behaviour. Though the offender is known to the victim, the department tends to go soft on the person and targets the victim. This is where we need a course correction in the thought process,” she pointed out.

Taking note, Mr. Anil Babu instructed the Mahila Mitras to reach out to the victim to settle the issue immediately rather than dragging it on. Apart from assuring tighter vigilance on women-related issues, he directed the officials concerned to fast-track such cases and bring culprits to justice within 21 days.

Deputy Superintendent of Police (Women) Venkateswara Rao, Circle Inspectors Anju Yadav, Padma Latha and People’s Action for Social Service (PASS) officer Manjula were among those present.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/20l8sp/article30681268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29VJMAHILAMITRAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/police-to-take-message-on-pocso-to-rural-areas-through-gram-sabhas/article30675788.ece

115,2020/01/28,HC stays conduct of Group I Mains exam for two weeks,"The High Court on Monday issued a stay order on the conduct of Group I Mains examination and directed the State government to explore the possibilities of conducting examination all over again. The HC Bench headed by Chief Justice J.K. Maheswari and N. Jaya Surya further issued notices to the Secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Public Service Commission (APPSC) and the Secretary of General Administration Department to furnish the compliance report within two weeks and postponed the hearing by two weeks.

Passing severe strictures on the State government, the High Court questioned the credibility of the preliminary exam question paper, on which the petitioners have approached the court stating that there were 51 errors in 120 questions.

The APPSC had issued a notification for the Group I services to fill up 169 posts in December 2018 and the preliminary examination was held on May 26, 2019. According to the schedule, the Group I Mains examination was supposed to be held from June 10, but was deferred. Meanwhile, petitioners filed a bunch of petitions in the High Court pleading that the court stay the release of results of preliminary examination as there were several discrepancies, including errors in Telugu translation of question papers, refusal of the APPSC to allow calculators, etc.

Finally, the results were released on November 1, 2019, and the APPSC announced a schedule to hold Mains exam from December 2, 2019 till December 14, 2019 and again the schedule was deferred to February.

Even as the candidates, who have qualified in the Prelims have completed their preparation and were to write Mains, the APPSC announcement to postpone the examination has shocked the aspirants.

“How can we prepare when there is so much uncertainty whether examinations will be held or not?” said a candidate from Guntur, who was qualified for Mains.

Some have cited that the government’s decision to start the coaching for the Mains, as the reason, but the sources in the APPSC, said that it was not true.

Moreover, 80% of 8,351 selected candidates are likely to appear for next UPSC Civil Services Preliminary Examination to be held on May 31, 2020. There is a lot of difference on how candidates prepare for a Prelims examination which is objective and mains examination which is subjective. So candidates have urged the APPSC to hold Group1 Mains examination as early as possible in the first week of March so that they get at least two months time for preparation of Civil Services Prelims Examination 2020.

Interviews for civil services 2019 examination for Andhra Pradesh candidates are supposed to be held in the last week of March and the first week of April. There may be a few candidates who will be attending UPSC interviews also.

Candidates urge that the APPSC must carefully plan the next schedule so that repeated postponement will not happen again undermining the Commission’s credibility.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hc-stays-conduct-of-group-i-mains-exam-for-two-weeks/article30675571.ece
116,2020/01/28,Maoists fast running out of friends in AOB stronghold,"In the intervening night of January 25 and 26, four hardcore Maoists accompanied by about 15 militia members went to Janturay, an interior village located in the cut-off area of Andhra Odisha Border, and asked villagers to hand them over four youth, whom they had branded police informers and supporters of development being undertaken by the government in that area.

When the villagers refused to oblige, the Maoists brandished their weapons. This angered the villagers who attacked the Naxalites with stones and sticks, resulting in the death of Maoist Ganga Madhi alias Adma, a native of Kalimela, and injuries to Jipra Hatrika, who carries a reward of ₹4 lakh on his head. Both were from the Guma area committee of the CPI (Maoist).

The youth have been creating awareness on the advantages of having a road, said a member of an NGO, who works in the area.

This incident opens up a new chapter in the tribal-Maoist conflict as the cut-off area is considered to be the operational headquarters of the banned outfit in the region from where it has been been operating since 2006.

Many senior leaders such as Akkiraju Haragopal alias RK, central committee member, and Gajarla Ravi alias Uday, secretary of AOBSZC (Andhra Odisha Border Special Zonal Committee), are believed to be present and operating from this area.

“Since the 2016 Ramaguda encounter in which 30 Maoists were killed by elite anti-Naxal force Greyhounds, the Naxalites have killed about 30 Girijans, ” said Superintendent of Police Attada Babujee. But this was the first time that the locals opposed the Maoists on a development issue, he pointed out.

The area with over 151 villages and a population of over 30,000, has remained cut off since the construction of the major irrigation projects at Machhkund in the 1960s and Balimela in the 80s, forcing the locals to depend on the Maoists.

Parallel govt.

The Maoists ran a parallel administration and at the same time getting the protection, logistical and manpower support.

But with the construction of the Gurupriya bridge in July 2018, the dynamics started to change.

“Now we have the bridge and what is needed is roads which will enable tribal people to have access to facilities such as education and medical, which the Maoists do not want,” said Mr. Babujee.

To facilitate the construction of roads in the area, the Central government recently set up BSF camps in Jantapai and Vantalagudda.

While the tribal people have realised that development is possible only if roads are laid, the Maoists are vehemently opposing for fear of losing their toehold, said a senior officer in the intelligence wing.

The construction of a 10-km road from Jantapai to Jodomba via Vantalagudda is on.

This is not the first time that the tribal people opposed the Maoists in the AOB. On October 19, 2014, residents of Veeravaram in Chintapalli mandal of Visakha Agency, attacked and killed Sindri China Ranga Rao alias Sarath, a DCM cadre Maoist, and injured Korra Nageswara Rao, in retaliation to the killing of Gemmeli Sanjeeva Rao, a religious leader. Some time in May-June 2018, the villagers of Galikonda panchayat took out a rally demanding a road between Chatraipalli and Galikonda ignoring the diktat of the Maoists.

117,2020/01/28,‘Jagan showing his true colours’,"Telugu Desam Party leaders on Monday came down on Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for his decision to dissolve the Legislative Council.

Addressing a media conference at the party office soon after Mr. Jagan moved a resolution to this effect in the Assembly, senior party leader and former Minister Kinjarapu Atchannaidu said that the CM should seek a fresh mandate over his governance.

Mr. Jagan was trying to undo the legacy of former CM and his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy who had revived the Council, the TDP leader said, adding the unilateral action showed the former’s immaturity.

“This action will be regretted by the CM as he is trying to suppress the voice of the Opposition. The Council consists of learned men and women, with experience in public life. By dissolving the Council, the CM is showing his true colours,’’ said Mr. Atchannaidu.

TDP floor leader in the Assembly Nimmala Ramanaidu said: “Dissolution of the Council amounts to suppressing the voice of BCs, SCs, STa and minorities as most of the MLCs are from BC and minority communities. The BCs will never forgive Mr. Jagan for taking this drastic and unprecedented decision,’’ said Mr. Ramanaidu.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-showing-his-true-colours/article30669922.ece
118,2020/01/28,Token harvest of Indian pompano grown in cages on January 28,"A token quantity of Indian pompano grown in cage culture by the ICAR-Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) will harvested here on Tuesday giving a shot in the arm to the Centre’s thrust on encouraging mariculture.

Four HDPE marine cages of 6 metre diameter and 3.5 m water depth were stocked with Indian pompano fingerlings (20-25 gram) during May- June last year. Two cages were stocked with 2,500 numbers and the other two were stocked with 3,000 numbers.

After a few months of culture, the fishes are ready for harvest. Fishes were initially fed artificial pellet containing 45% protein which was later reduced to 40% protein. Feeding regime was initially 5-8% of biomass, which was later reduced to 2-3% of biomass. Survival was more than 90% and the body weight at harvest ranged from 500 to 600 gram, said Shubhadeep Ghosh, Principal Scientist, Visakhapatnam Regional Centre of CMFRI.

In a chat with The Hindu, he said on Tuesday that mariculture was the fastest growing sub-sector of aquaculture in the world. In contrast to the global scenario, where mariculture of finfishes is a well-developed industry, in India it is gradually emerging out from its infancy.

“One important aspect hindering the rapid progress of mariculture in the country is the non-availability of quality seeds of high value finfishes. However, in recent years, with success in breeding and seed production technology of several high value commercially important finfishes, thankfully due to the consistent efforts of ICAR-CMFRI, mariculture sector is poised to make a serious contribution to the fish basket of India,” he stated.

Presently, quality seeds are available for cobia, Indian and silver pompano and grouper round the year in various hatcheries of CMFRI at multiple locations.

Dr. Ghosh said Visakhapatnam Regional Centre of the CMFRI had successfully developed in the recent past seed production technology for Indian pompano (Trachinotus mookalee) and orange spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) for the first time in the country. Subsequently, for developing techno-economically viable methodologies on nursery rearing and grow-out in cages and ponds, seeds have been distributed to research institutes, the State government-owned facilities and private entrepreneurs.

He said, “Cage farming technology is widely recognised as the most important technology in mariculture for increasing fish production to meet the food-fish demand. In Andhra Pradesh and in the country as a whole, sea and estuarine cage culture technology is a new and recent activity.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/4x0xhb/article30669897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28-VZ-CMFRIHARVEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/token-harvest-of-indian-pompano-grown-in-cages-on-january-28/article30669898.ece

The company has plans to roll out full stack financial services across lending, payments, savings and protection with an aim to increase its customer base to 25 million customers in the next two years, Realme PaySa Lead Varun Sridhar told The Hindu.

He said their focus was to spread their reach to metros and as well as tier two and three cities and offer solutions to both individuals and SMEs and they had the largest customer base in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana with two million downloading Realme PaySa app. “Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada and Rajamahendravaram have huge potential for us in A.P.,” he said.

Mr. Sridhar said they were in the process of identifying five tier three and four cities/towns in the two Telugu States. On the whole, a bouquet of financial services kick-started by them on December 17 last year, he said adding their strategy was to primarily acquire and service customers through an easy-to-use, innovative platform, supplemented with a physical distribution.

He said the app, available on both Google Playstore and Realme App store, would have four verticals of businesses viz. lending, savings, payment and protection. Beta app offers digital personal loans up to ₹1 lakh and digital SME loans up to ₹5 lakh.

Larger loan requirements for both individuals and SMEs are serviced by the Realme PaySa teams present in different cities. He said for the platform gives an instant free credit report with an easy to understand interface, account level details and free updates for three months.

Mr. Sridhar said, to give hassle-free experience in using phones, they were providing screen damage insurance for old and new devices with an option of insuring one or two damages per year. He said their focus on providing data privacy and customer security.

On their projections, he said in 2020 the platform aims to disburse loans of approximately ₹1,000 crore, launch multiple new products and take its first step in financial services in India.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/realme-to-roll-out-full-stack-financial-services/article30669818.ece
120,2020/01/28,Assembly adopts resolutionfor abolition of Council,"The Assembly on Monday adopted a statutory resolution for the abolition of the Legislative Council with 133 members, including the lone Jana Sena MLA, voting for it and none opposing it. The Opposition Telugu Desam Party had on Sunday made it clear that it would boycott the proceedings.

Speaker Thammineni Seetharam declared that the government had moved the resolution as per Article 169 (1) of the Constitution and 133 members out of those ‘present and voting’ gave their consent for the abolition of the Council. After initially putting the number at 121, it was enhanced to 133 after a proper counting.

Before taking up the division behind closed doors as per procedures, Mr. Seetharam asked Ministers Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose and Mopidevi Venkata Ramana to be seated separately as they were no longer members of the Council. Both left the House at the time of counting the members.

Earlier, replying to the discussion on the resolution which he had moved in the morning, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the Council had lost its ‘public utility’ and spending even a single rupee on it from the treasury would be waste of public money.

The CM observed that the Assembly was under no obligation to accommodate the amendments to Bills proposed by the Council and that he said that the ruling party could wait to secure a majority in the Council once the term of the present one expired but he made up his mind to get it scrapped in public interest.

He asserted that democracy would be in jeopardy if Legislative Councils acted as per the whims and fancies of their members, adding that only six States — A.P., Telangana, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — have Councils.

“When the Assembly has three Ph.D-holders, 38 post-graduates, 13 medical doctors, 14 engineers, 68 graduates, three former IAS officers, one Group-I officer, a professor and a few teachers and farmers, there is absolutely no need to continue the Council which is supposed to have intellectuals but has members who have no people’s support,” he observed.

‘Political objectives’

Mr. Jagan said the political objectives of the Council were evident from its reference of the Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and CRDA Repeal Bills to a select committee in blatant violation of norms.

Besides, the Council returned the Bills meant for forming separate Commissions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and introducing English medium in government schools.

Saying that former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had influenced the Council Chairman during the debate on the decentralisation and CRDA repeal Bills, Mr. Jagan said the good things which he wanted to do were being projected as acts of injustice.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/da0wlw/article30669562.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28VJJAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/assembly-adopts-resolutionfor-abolition-of-council/article30669564.ece

“On Republic Day - the first day of Village and Ward Secretariats going functional, out of 2,999 requests for services received all over the State, 1,180 were from Anantapur district alone,” explained District Collector Gandham Chandrudu jubilantly.

During a surprise visit to a couple of village secretariats in Bukkarayasamudram mandal on Monday, while he appreciated the zeal with which the newly-appointed secretariat staff tried to learn their work, he observed that the office layout design at many places was not user-friendly.

“Our focus is to make internet connectivity operational at offices at least a week before the formal launch of the online ‘Citizen Services’ programme,” Mr. Chandrudu said.

Mr. Savadi, who also holds transport portfolio, told reporters in Bengaluru on Tuesday that such a system had been planned by the Centre as owners of high-value vehicles were registering their vehicles in States that have lesser taxes.

But, implementation of such a system was estimated to result in shortfall of tax to the tune of ₹1,000 crore in Karnataka, the minister said, while adding that the issue of implementation of the proposed system would be discussed during the budget session of the state legislature.

125,2020/01/28,"Shore up tax collection, say former mayors","The failure of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) to meet its property tax target came under focus during a pre-budget meeting convened on Tuesday.

The meeting was chaired by the newly elected Mayor, Tasneem, and convened to elicit feedback on raising revenue and identifying thrust areas.

Former Mayor B.L. Bhyrappa said the revenue officials should be pulled up for their failure to meet the target. He said there were many layouts within the MCC where owners were not prompt in paying property tax though all civic amenities are being extended by the MCC to these layouts, mostly revenue and private extension.

He urged the authorities to expedite the launch of on-line system of payment of property tax as it would help increase the collection, given the ease with which the public can make payments.

Sandesh Swamy, another former Mayor, said the MCC revenue has been stagnant since the last few years and there was no growth and hence officials should be given stiff financial target.

Though there are thousands of commercial outlets and complexes, not many traders were prompt in paying trade tax and property tax.

Similarly, a section of the citizens living in the MUDA layouts were paying property tax to the MUDA though all services are being provided by the MCC and hence the Commissioner should set right the anomaly, he added.

The general perception and feedback of the councillors was that the city was registering rapid growth while its revenue was shrinking or has remained stagnant. The water tax due from the consumers runs into crores of rupees and efforts should be made to collect the same to shore up revenue, said Purushottam, a former councillor and former Mayor.

R. Lingappa said many of the projects mooted in the budget are not implemented at all due to shortage of funds and hence there should be no compromise on tax collection.

He said the projects mooted in the budget should not be based on notional revenue or income given the uncertainty of realising them.

Former Mayor Pushpalatha Jagannath and others were also present.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2d6syc/article30677753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MYSMEETING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/shore-up-tax-collection-say-former-mayors/article30677754.ece
126,2020/01/28,Just three more days to go for Mysureans to make a ‘difference’,"With three days left for Swachh Survekshan-2020 to conclude, the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), which is eyeing the top ‘Swachh’ spot this time, is keeping its fingers crossed and is hoping Mysureans go all out to vote for Mysuru for improving its chances.

As on today, about 66,000 citizens have voted for Mysuru. In the next three days, the MCC hopes to garner at least 50,000 to 60,000 more votes to put Mysuru in a “comfortable” position among cities vying for the national recognition on the cleanliness front.

Citizens can vote for Mysuru in the survey by going to the webpage https://swachhsurvekshan

2020.org/Citizen

Feedback

“The citizens’ response was not on the expected lines but the voting has gained some traction now. We have now reached the 66,000-mark. People can spare a minute, vote for Mysuru even now and share their feedback. Hopefully, lots of Mysureans make use of the next three days to vote to the maximum to see their city top the list of ranks,” said MCC Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Hegde said Mysuru did not get the feedback as expected even in the past, and cities such as Indore and Ambikapur overtook Mysuru as they received maximum votes from their residents. “We slipped in ranking although we obtained a good score in other parameters. I am still hoping to see the votes to cross 1.50 lakh if the citizens make up their mind and vote,” he stated.

Pourakarmikas have entered the field, making door-to-door visits in their wards and requesting the people to vote. “They know people in the wards as they go there daily for cleaning and collecting garbage. Their involvement is making a difference as the voting has seen a jump. After their work too, they are going in groups seeking votes for Mysuru. Our health teams too are interacting with the citizens, sharing the ward issues with them,” said MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj.

He told The Hindu that the pourkarmikas, numbering around 2,000, have taken up this campaign on their own.

Expressing confidence of garnering more votes in the next three days, Dr. Nagaraj said the entire MCC staff is on the job and making team effort to maximise the votes.

The teams have targeted educational institutions to increase the votes, engaging the students. JSS Mahavidyapeeta alone has about 31 institutions and a vast student base. The staff and students have promised to give their feedback, he added.

Dr. Nagaraj said the Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) has given a LED-mounted vehicle to encourage its customers to vote for Mysuru in the survey.

The vehicle goes around its 20-plus outlets all over the city and the outlet staff requests the customers to do their job.

Some NGOs have sent their volunteers to the campaign to urge the citizens to vote for Mysuru.

“Let’s Do It Mysore has roped in college students for the job. Others too have chipped in,” he said.

The college students, numbering about 150, have been tasked with getting as many citizens as possible to participate in the effort to put Mysuru in a better position this time.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q00alz/article30677746.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MYSSWACHH1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/just-three-more-days-to-go-for-mysureans-to-make-a-difference/article30677747.ece
127,2020/01/28,"Not a drop to drink, insist these women seeking liquor ban","Kudalasangama, an important pilgrim centre where the Krishna and the Malaprabha meet, is witnessing a unique anti-liquor agitation by a group of women. On Tuesday, they stood in waist-deep water for hours, demanding complete ban on liquor.

The women are part of the Karnataka Madya Nishedha Andolana, an organisation of largely women who have long been demanding a ban on liquor, with a series of agitation. Last year, they marched all the way from various parts of North Karnataka to Bengaluru pressing for the demand.

On Tuesday, a group of women from the organisation stood in waist-deep water at the Kudalasangama confluence, a place associated with the 12th Century social reformer Basaveshwara, raising slogans and holding placards on the ills of liquor consumption.

Yellamma, a woman from Lingsugur taluk, who was among the agitators, said that her husband is alcoholic and most of his earnings goes into drinking. “I have been participating in all the agitations for the last four years and yet the government has not taken notice of our protests. It has no concern for the families who are suffering because of alcoholics,” she said.

“Liquor is making the lives of children and women miserable,” said Swarna Bhatt, coordinator of the andolana, on the huge social costs of liquor. While liquor sales are justified in the name of revenue generation, its health and social costs are too high, she added. She accused the successive governments of refusing to address this vital issue.

“We keep reading news reports about rapes and molestation of women everyday. But then, most of these reports blame the victims for the crimes committed against them. We are a nation that worships women as goddesses. We should teach boys about the virtues of gender equality and the need to treat women as equal partners in society,’’ she said.

She was speaking at the Stree Shakti Mela, a rally of self-help group members organised by the government at the Gandhi Bhavan.

“Women are still fighting for equal rights. The huge gap between opportunities available and status of men and women can be understood by studying issues such as female infanticide,” she said.

She said that the State government’s Bhagya Lakshmi scheme had helped families with girl children to a large extent.

“Those eligible families left out of the Bhagya Lakshmi scheme would be included in a one-time settlement offer,” she said.

She urged officers to properly implement Prime Minister’s Matru Vandana and Chief Minister’s Matru Shree schemes.

The protesters were also joined by members of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) including Prasad Abbayya, MLA, former Minister A.M. Hindasageri, and KPCC office-bearers.

The protesters congregated at B.R. Ambedkar statue near the Head Post Office and garlanded the statue before taking out the march.

Holding flags and banners of dalit organisations and anti-CAA placards, they marched from Ambedkar statue to Mini Vidhana Soudha covering Lamington Road, Sangolli Rayanna Statue and Kittur Chennamma Circle.

Mr. Prasad Abbayya said that despite opposition from various minority communities and progressive organisations, the Union government had not changed its stand. The opposition would continue till the new law was repealed, he said.

He termed CAA as a draconian law that meted out injustice to not only Muslims but also to Hindus. “Giving citizenship just based on documents is highly condemnable. At a time when the country was undergoing economic slowdown, it is highly condemnable that thousands of crores were being spent to enact the law. The Union government should immediately abolish the new law”, he said.

On reaching the Mini Vidhana Soudha, the protesters held a demonstration and subsequently submitted a memorandum addressed to the President, seeking abolition of the new law, to the Hubballi tahsildar.

Deputy Conservator of Forests Sivaram Babu told The Hindu that the person suffered a fracture. He is undergoing treatment. The officer said the department had decided to radio-collar three elephants to track their movements so that man-elephant encounters could be avoided.

“We have sought permission to radio-collar three elephants. Among them two are tuskers, roaming separately, and another is leading a herd. An operation would be conducted in February to radio-collar them”, the officer said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/one-injured-in-elephant-attack/article30675005.ece
135,2020/01/28,"Yediyurappa in a fix, has no money for development works: Siddaramaiah","Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has said that the B.S. Yediyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka does not have funds for development works, and consequently development works in the State have been hit.

He told presspersons at Hubballi airport on Tuesday that the last quarter of the financial year was the time when 75% of the works gain momentum. “If the government does not release the funds now, how will development take place? If not now when are they going to take up development works? ”, he asked.

“They don’t have money and the Centre has not given an money. Funds under MNREGA have not been released and even the State’s share of taxes has not been released. Consequently funds are not being released even for sanctioned projects. Mr. Yediyurappa keeps on mentioning about the budget and asking the people to wait till the budget. Does he have a magic wand?” Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

Mr. Siddaramaiah said that the Chief Minister is in a fix as he has to keep his promise to the “disqualified MLAs” who have been re-elected now. “Expansion of the Cabinet is the prerogative of the Chief Minister. It is a pity that the BJP high command is not allowing Mr. Yediyurappa to take a decision because the party does not believe in internal democracy. He is not even being given an appointment and he has no freedom. He has to just listen to the party high command. He is in a fix and is struggling”, Mr. Siddaramaiah said.

He termed his breakfast meeting with the senior leader Mallikarjun Kharge as a casual one, and they met coincidentally at the party office. He asked presspersons not to attach any significance to it. The party would shortly take a decision on the KPCC chief’s post, he said.

Terming the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as anti-constitutional, he said that not only Muslims but also dalits, tribals, adivasis, nomads and backward classes would be affected badly by the new law, which discriminated on the basis of religion and caste.

On the allegations against PFI, Mr Siddaramaiah said that the investigation had already begun and action should be taken against all those involved. “If anybody is getting money illegally from abroad, action should be taken against them”, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappa-in-a-fix-has-no-money-for-development-works-siddaramaiah/article30673829.ece
136,2020/01/28,Coffee planter found dead,"A coffee planter was found dead at a cattle shed near his house at Heggadde in Sakleshpur taluk on Monday. The police have identifed him as Anukaran, 40.

His wife, Ramya, in her complaint to the police, said Anukaran was disturbed over clearing the loan he had taken for his farming. The yield from the estate was very low as the crop was damaged repeatedly by elephants.

Anukaran had borrowed ₹8 lakh from Corporation Bank, besides ₹1.5 lakh from a private firm. The police have registered a case for further investigation.

Karnataka Growers Federation (KGF) and Hassan District Planters' Association, expressing shock over the incident, have appealed to the planters’ community not to lose confidence over the loss in the estates due to various factors, including floods and elephant attack.

U.M. Thirthamalles, president of KGF, told The Hindu, “It is disappointing to know that planters are committing suicide unable to bear the loss. The State and Central governments should come to their rescue.”

The banks were told to restructure loans and grant fresh loans. However, they had not done so. “The yield in coffee estates has come down drastically. Many farmers are facing difficulty in clearing loans. The planters’ community has been hoping that the budget would provide some relief to our problems”, he said.

138,2020/01/28,Defer Kannada sammelana:Ex-ZP member Gurushant Pattedar,"With just a week left for the 85th Akhil Bharat Kannada Sahitya Sammelana to be held in Kalaburagi, the former zilla panchayat member Gurushant Pattedar urged the Kannada Sahitya Parishat to postpone the literary event as there is not enough time available to organise the sammelan and make it a grand success.

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Mr. Pattedar said that all the preparations for the sammelan started just a fortnight ago. The organising of the sammelan was limited to the government officials and the pubic representatives, neglecting the various organisations, literary figures, and people from different fraternities.

He was also irked over the alleged negligence of the parishat, the district administration, and the elected representatives towards the leaders who were the key figures in the movements seeking justice for Kalyana Karnataka.

The parishat has failed to mention the names of leaders such as Vaijnath Patil, Vishwanath Reddy Mudnal, Hanumanthrao Desai, freedom fighter Vidyadhar Guruji, and Jagannath Chandraki, he said.

The parishat also neglected the former Minister M. Mallikarjun Kharge, the man behind the region getting Article 371(J) of the Constitution providing special status.

Mr. Pattedar said that it was owing to the efforts of Mr. Kharge that the sammelan was being held in Kalaburagi district.

Mr. Pattedar has also threatened to boycott the sammelan on the inaugural day and stage a black flag demonstration against the Chief Minister for neglecting the leaders and literary figures of the region.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xzslod/article30671923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGKALABURAGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/defer-kannada-sammelanaex-zp-member-gurushant-pattedar/article30671924.ece

The protest was organised by Karnataka State Road Transport Employees’ League. Protesters included drivers, conductors and mechanics.

Speaking to The Hindu, Tippeswamy. K., general secretary of the league, said that if their demands were not met during the session, they would start ticket-less travel. “If our demands are not met, we will start ticket-less travel where we will work but not issue tickets,” he said.

Another protester said that even they should be brought under Arogya Sanjeevani programme. “The police are beneficiaries. In the same way, it has to be extended to us,” the protester said. “We have been demanding this for years and have conducted various types of protests. We have written to all concerned officials and ministers,” he said.

142,2020/01/28,"Identify kin of prisoners who died unnaturally, for compensation: Karnataka High Court","The High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State government to appoint Deputy Commissioners of each district as the authority to identity kin of prisoners, who died unnaturally in various prisons in the State from 2012 to May 30, 2019, and disburse the ad hoc compensation amount computed by the government based on the notional income of the deceased prisoner.

Laying down guidelines to identify kin and disburse the compensation amount, the HC directed the DCs to first secure the details of kin from the respective prisons and also issue public notice in local newspapers with a wide circulation in the district to publish the names of deceased prisoners and inviting his kins to submit claims for compensation.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition, suo motu registered by the HC on the apex court’s direction to all High Courts to grant compensation to those prisoners who died unnaturally in the prison.

Kin of around 40 prisoners are eligible for compensation. A few prisoners, who committed suicide outside the prison and those who were already paid compensation on the orders of State Human Rights Commission, were kept out of purview of the exercise.

The Bench said that the DCs, after giving sufficient time to submit claims, will have to adopt the summary enquiry process to ascertain the identity of the kin. They will have to ensure that claimants will have to open accounts in nationalised banks and compensation will have to be paid through bank accounts after obtaining indemnity bonds subject of final determination of compensation, the Bench said, while clarifying that the DCs can use the service of police officers, assistant commissioners, tahsildars, and other revenue officers for assistance.

Though the Bench has allowed disbursement of ad hoc compensation amount, as computed by the government, it clarified that it is yet to decide the question of determination of compensation at a later stage.

Mr. Shetty, 80, had been admitted to the hospital a fortnight ago. He leaves behind wife and two daughters.

He joined Janata Party in 1977 and was MLA for Mulki-Moodbidri for three terms — 1983, 1987, and 1994. He was Minister for Labour and also held Muzrai and Agriculture portfolios. For a brief while he was with Ramakrishna Hegde’s Rashtriya Navanirmana Vedike before joining Janata Dal (S).

144,2020/01/28,This govt. school in Udupi is now brimming with students,"A creative idea and persistent effort can go a long way in increasing admissions to a government school. The Government Higher Primary Hindustani School at Nagur, Kirimanjeshwara, in Kundapur taluk of Udupi district exemplifies this.

Two years ago this school had only 18 students, and the headmaster, Vishwanath Poojary, decided to paint the school like a train drawing inspiration when he saw another school in Kerala painted like a train on the Internet. He invested his own money of ₹36,000 and with the help of teachers, got the school painted as a train in January 2018. This made the school a ‘selfie’ point.

However, when students passed class seven, the strength declined to eight students in 2018-19. Then, the push was for change beyond the cosmetic. A School Development Committee (SDC) was formed with representatives from the Old Students’ Association, School Development and Monitoring Committee (SDMC), local Panchayat members and the headmaster as its members.

The collective efforts of the SDC led to the collection of donation of ₹21 lakh. They managed to buy a van at a cost of ₹9 lakh and also furniture for the school. The school began LKG and UKG sections in the 2019-20 academic year. As a result of all the implemnted measures, the school’s strength jumped to 83 in 2019-20.

The SDC acquired additional books to teach spoken English to the students. The van picks them from their homes to the school. “Our efforts have paid off and now we have 83 students. We started our admissions for next academic year this month. Already 35 students have got admitted. This number will surely go up. We expect to cross a strength of 100 for the the 2020-21 academic year,” Mr. Poojary said.

This school, established in 1973, will be celebrating its golden jubilee in 2023. It now has four government teachers and two additional teachers paid by the SDC. “Our target is reach 250 students in 2023. We are confident of surpassing even this target,” said Mr. Poojary.

“Mr. Poojary and the SDC rose to the occasion when the student strength of the school was declining,” said Abdul Raoof, Block Resource Centre Coordinator.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ed4bt3/article30670210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGUDUPISCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/this-govt-school-is-now-brimming-with-students/article30670211.ece
145,2020/01/28,"We are being provoked, but peace is the watchword: Archbishop Peter Machado","Kapalabetta hillock, by the sleepy Harobele village near Bengaluru, is suddenly in the news. A proposal to install a statue of Jesus Christ over 114 ft in height has been bitterly opposed by Hindutva groups, while the government has ordered an enquiry into the allotment of 10 acres of gomala land. The enquiry report by the Ramanagaram Deputy Commissioner is yet to be made public. The Christian community, on the other hand, has been arguing that the land allotment is in order and that the hillock has been used by them for more than 100 years on Good Friday to remember the Passion of the Christ. The Hindu spoke to the Archbishop of Bengaluru, Peter Machado, on the matter. Excerpts from the interview.

What do you think made the statue issue controversial?

If at all the Hindus of that area were saying the statue should not be there, I can understand. Locally, people have no problem. In fact, they take part in the programmes happily. We are asking for a statue and we do not know how it will affect other communities. There are certain people outside who are trying to influence them. The fringe elements are making this an issue.

Have the land rules been violated in any way?

The land was legally allotted to us and we have not encroached. We obey the government rules and regulations. Our scriptures direct us to respect the government because the authority [of the government] comes from God. Attempts are being made to find fault in what was legally given to us. If there are loopholes, rectify them. If they [the Congress and JD(S)] have given land, you [BJP] can help us put up the statue.

Has the Christian community been hurt by all this?

Yes. We did not expect such vehement opposition. We would have understood if we had caused any loss or violated the laws. It is disappointing that accusations of conversion are being hurled at us. More than 1.5 lakh students study in church-run institutions in Bengaluru, and thousands visit our hospitals. Are there any reports of conversions?

What has been the church’s response to the matter?

We are waiting for the report and our response is to not get agitated. Our message is that if it is God’s will, we will get it. If not, let us not break our heads over it. We are being provoked, but peace is the watchword. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is a gentleman, and it is up to the government to understand our sentiments.

Do you believe the statue is important?

I will be proud of the statue. I also stand by the peaceful aspirations and the people’s desire to have the statue installed. The statue, in itself, is not important. But a sanctuary or a pilgrimage centre helps bring more people to pray and gives us occasion to work towards the betterment of society. The message is that let us not have a situation where the statue is the foremost priority. If there are philanthropists funding the statue, we will be happy and the church will contribute too.

What will be your course of action now?

If truly something is missing and defective, and the government wants to set it right, I am all for it. If they want to withdraw permission for a flimsy reason, then of course we will seek legal recourse. But I do not think that we will go to that level. Some goodwill and good sense will prevail somewhere. On the other hand, we will not reduce our efforts and zeal for social work. Whether people applaud us or put us down, we will continue with our work.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/t8wfz7/article30670199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGARCHBISHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/we-are-being-provoked-but-peace-is-the-watchword/article30670200.ece
146,2020/01/28,"In 4 years, only 18 take scholarships meant for HIV/leprosy-affected","In the last four years, only 18 students under the Department of Technical Education have availed themselves of scholarship programmes meant for HIV/leprosy affected.

This scholarship is available to students of engineering colleges or polytechnics who are affected by HIV/leprosy and also to students whose parents are suffering from the same. In the past four years, the department has spent ₹11.75 lakh towards these programmes.

H.U. Talwar, director, Department of Technical Education (DTE), said the students were “not willing” to disclose if they belonged to these families or were suffering from ailments, fearing discrimination from classmates or college managements.

Simpler procedure

Several HIV activists as well as the Karnataka State AIDS Prevention Society had batted for the procedures for this scholarship to be simplified so that more people avail them. In addition, they have also requested that the name of the scholarship programme is changed.

Students whose parents are living with HIV/AIDS or leprosy or are themselves affected by these diseases are eligible to get free education as well as a stipend. This includes a monthly education allowance and money for books and clothes.

Name not changed

The Department of Collegiate Education had changed the name of the scholarship to ‘Students who are under special care and belong to special category student scholarship’ to avoid the students from facing discrimination. However, the DTE has not changed the name of the scholarship programme.

Other scholarships

Besides this programme, the number of students who have availed other scholarships too has reduced in the 2018-19 academic year compared to the previous year. The scholarship for students from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities as well as defence scholarships too have reduced.

Department officials attributed this to the decline in admissions in engineering and polytechnic colleges across the State. “This is a trend we are seeing across the country. When admissions are low, the number of scholarships will naturally reduce,” an official said.

Pratibha Puraskar

Only the Pratibha Puraskar scholarships for students whose families are Below the Poverty Line and have secured a minimum of 80% in the Common Entrance Test (CET) have increased. While 308 students availed of these in 2017-18, the number increased to 712 in the 2018-19 academic year.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/phlhwj/article30670154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGAIDSSYMBOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/in-4-years-only-18-take-scholarships-meant-for-hivleprosy-affected/article30670155.ece

Speaking to reporters at his residence here, Mr. Koliwad, who lost the 2018 Assembly elections and the 2019 byelections, said the high command was dragging its feet on the appointment of a new chief of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee.

The delay in appointing a Leader of the Opposition and a KPCC president will harm the party’s future, he said. He also said the Congress had become akin to “stagnant water” because of this. Noting that the imposition of conditions on the party high command by State leaders on the appointment of a new KPCC president did not augur well for the party’s future, Mr. Koliwad urged the central leaders to take a clear stance so that party workers do not lose confidence in their leadership.

He urged senior Congress leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge to assume leadership on the matter of choosing a new KPCC chief.

149,2020/01/28,Anticipatory bail for duo in Mysuru sedition case,"A Mysuru court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to Nalini B. and Maridevaiah in a sedition case booked by the city police.

The Second Additional District and Sessions Judge, Mysuru, R. Mendonca, said the petitioners should execute personal bonds for a sum of ₹50,000 each, with one surety for like sum in the event of their arrest by the police in the sedition case.

The conditions stipulated by the court include their surrender before the jurisdictional court within a period of one month and furnishing of bail and surety. They are not to tamper with the prosecution witness directly or indirectly, or repeat similar offences in future. The petitioners were also directed to cooperate with the investigating officer and appear before him as and when called.

The other conditions stipulate that the petitioners should appear before the officer once every 15 days, preferably on a Sunday between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., till the filing of the final report or for three months, whichever is earlier. They are also to regularly attend all the hearings and to surrender their passports to the court.

The city police booked a sedition case after Ms. Nalini held aloft a placard stating “free Kashmir” during a protest against the violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University. The protest was organised by the University of Mysore’s Research Scholars’ Association and Bahujan Vidyarthi Sangha at Manasagangotri in Mysuru on January 8. The police also named Mr. Maridevaiah, president of the association, as an accused.

Against shutdown

Ms. Nalini is an alumna of the Department of Studies in Mass Communication and Journalism, UoM, who is currently pursuing a Masters degree in design at the National Institute of Designs in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. She has contended that the intention behind the placard was to request the government to bring Kashmir back to normal, following the Internet shutdown, healthcare crisis and restriction on movement there.

Subsequent to the controversy over this, the Mysuru Advocates’ Association adopted a resolution against appearing on behalf of the accused in sedition cases. However, many lawyers from different parts of the State turned up in Mysuru when Ms. Nalini’s anticipatory bail petition came up for hearing and filed their Vakalatnama.

The court heard the arguments of both sides on Friday and reserved order on the matter to Monday. While K.C.

Mr. Achar had come to the college for symbolically distributing a few laptops to first-year degree students under a government scheme. The students closed the main gate of the college after the MLA entered the premises and staged a demonstration condemning the “discrimination” in distributing laptops to students.

Shivakumar in various parts of the State between September 3 and 11, 2019.

A statement was submitted before a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar during the hearing of PIL petitions seeking action to recover damages from those who gave bandh calls and organised protests opposing Mr. Shivakumar’s arrest in September 2019, and from those who gave bandh calls between January and April 2018 in connection with Mahadayi river water dispute.

157,2020/01/28,Farmer from Sagar taluk tests positive for KFD,"A 43-year-old farmer, identified as Swamy Thimma Naik, from Kunjavalli village in Sagar taluk has been tested positive for Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, on Sunday.

With this, the total number of positive cases in Shivamogga district since January 1 has risen to 17. This includes 14 cases from Tirthahalli taluk and three from Sagar taluk. One person has died due to this viral infection during this period.

Even though Mr. Naik had received three doses of vaccine against KFD since the past one year, he has been infected with the virus. He is being treated at government sub-divisional hospital in Sagar city at present.

Rajesh Suragihalli, District Health Officer, told The Hindu that the laboratory tests had revealed that the viral load in the blood samples of Mr. Naik was low and he was on the path of recovery.

Following the incident, the personnel of Department of Health and Family Welfare have been on door-to-door visits in Kunjavalli and the the adjacent villages on Sunday to create awareness among the people on the precautions to be taken to avoid coming into contact with the ticks that spreads the disease from monkeys to humans.

158,2020/01/28,A reality check,"Make in India (MII), a mega roadmap aimed at making India a global manufacturing hub was announced by Government of India in September 2014. Its goal was to raise the share of the manufacturing sector to the gross domestic product (GDP) to 25 per cent by 2022, from 16 per cent. As it has been more than five years to the policy, Xavier Institute of Management and Entrepreneurship, Electronic City, Bengaluru organised a two-day conference that discussed the journey of MII so far and the way forward.

The speakers at Make in India: Make it work discussed the nature of this policy, perspectives for viewing it in times of economic slowdown and challenges to be addressed for achieving it within the intended time-line.

B. Muthuraman, Former Vice-chairman, TATA steel in his keynote address stated: “No country in the world has achieved progress without going through dominance in the manufacturing sector. It’s our time to take advantage of this.” Listing opportunities India has historically missed in the areas of invention of steam engine, assembly-line production, textile, communication etc., Deepak Kumar Hota, CMD, BEML observed: “Except that India has taken some advantage of the digital revolution, everything else it has terribly missed. We should not be repeating our past mistakes now at the time of fourth industrial revolution (industry 4.0).”

Its course so far

“Therefore, Make in India is the right frame at the right time,” said R. Mukundan, Managing Director, Tata Chemicals in another panel discussion that followed the inauguration ceremony. If Muthuraman listed sectors that have been doing well like the construction, railway, insurance and medical, Mukundan segregated the sectors based on their level of performance. “While digital, FDI and petrochemicals are doing really well, automobile industry is performing poorly. Biotech, pharma and tourism are doing moderately well,” he observed.

What is stopping industries in some of the sectors from performing well? Addressing this question, Mukundan observed: “Why out of 56 Japanese companies that wanted to relocate from China, only three of them came to India? This data shows the extent of industry-friendly environment we have in India.” If complex government approval route was stated as the prime reason for India not attracting foreign companies, instability of policies was mentioned as the second-most-stated reason by MNCs. Apart from these, there are also problems related to labour such as unskilled labour, untimely delivery and cultural issues, explained panellists.

“Unskilled and unprepared labour force is unpleasant for MNCs and this has to do with our higher education system. While we are targeting to provide jobs to 100 million workforce, are we making sure that they are employable?” asked Jaimini Bhagwati, Former High Commissioner to the U.K. in his inaugural talk.

Providing an example of how to make students industry-ready, Raghavan Srinivasan, Editor, Business Line narrated how Singaporean government introduced world-class aerospace engineering curriculum years before approaching world’s best aerospace companies to set up their manufacturing units in Singapore. “They even got globally approved certifications done for their universities. That’s the way to go about. Planning requires looking at the complete chain of production,” he opined.

According to him, there is enough home talent but it’s not being utilised properly. “As a result we are lagging behind in intellectual property rights (IPRs) as well,” he added. Other reasons why India is not attracting investors might be pollution, political instability, communal conflict etc., enumerated Raghavan.

For home industries to flourish, resources should be available to them. “I don’t think we should be exporting iron ore any more,” he felt.

If MII is a smart idea for Raghavan, it’s a fine policy document for Mukundan. In the opinion of Muthuraman, there is no reason to doubt the potential of MII at all. He said: “The slowdown is mostly the effect of global market fluctuations. In fact, this slowdown helps in the long-run development of India.” Similar views were expressed by Deepak Hota.

What’s the reality?

Whereas, Rajeev Gowda, MP provided a reality check of the policy on the second day of the conference. “Growth of manufacturing sector instead of being at the intended rate of 12-13 percent, has declined miserably. In paper MII had to provide 100 million jobs, but in reality it has thrown out 20 million labourers from work in the textile industry. In the automobile sector about 3.5 lakh people have lost their jobs in 2019 alone. Besides, there have been constant lay-offs and factory shut downs. Therefore ground reality has to be juxtaposed against aspiration, only then do you see the truth,” said Gowda.

For him, manufacturing does not just include big players such as Volvo, but also micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and people being employed in these manufacturing units. “The demonetisation measure has destabilised the informal economy as they were largely cash-driven. Due to fear of lynching, leather industry in which India had competitive advantage in the global market is also badly hit.”

According to Gowda, we have missed the bus again. “Even in textile industry, countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh are outshining us,” he added.

Gowda also explained how each component of the GDP is contributing negatively. When food consumption has gone down in the rural areas, he felt that instead of cutting corporate tax, the revenue foregone could have been used for uplifting the poor.

“All the government has done is it has fixed some visible issues. Therefore, the grandiose of MII lies more as a rhetoric than a reality,” he said.

The way forward

If Mukundan proposed for recycling old industrial areas instead of grabbing agricultural lands for setting up manufacturing units, Bhagwati urged policy makers to focus on higher education in order to obtain competent labour force.

While MII is being touted as a Swadeshi movement, Narayan Ramachandran, Advisor, Takshashila Institution, observed, “as MII is manufacturing in India for the world, Indian education system should be a mix of both, desi and international.” Knowing the best of both worlds is necessary in the current times, he felt.

160,2020/01/28,State to promote fish farming in Idukki: Minister,"Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma has said the government aims at increasing fish wealth by promoting fish farming among farmers in the district.

After visiting the proposed fish seed farm at Chenkulam on Tuesday, the Minister said the district had a congenial topography for fish farming.

Job opportunities

Fish, even for Idukki’s domestic use, could be procured from the clean water ponds and dams. This would create job opportunities and a source of steady income, as there would be many takers for quality river fish.

To effectively implement fish farming, more women entrepreneurs should be brought into the sector. The Fisheries Department would aid woman entrepreneurs in ornamental fish sector. Possibilities of setting up aquariums could also be explored at tourist destinations, she said.

The proposed fish seed farm had been identified in the area under the Kerala State Electricty Board (KSEB) near the Chenkulam dam. The fish farming would be extended to all reservoirs under the KSEB and tribespeole would be given rights for fishing. Societies and joint liability groups (JLGs) would be formed to promote self-sufficiency among the tribespeople. She said nearly 300 families were in the fish farming sector and they would be included in the welfare fund.

The district was the first in promoting fish farming in the State, according to the Minister. New entrepreneurs had come into the sector, who would be well-supported by the department, she said.

The Minister also gave direction to officials to submit a report on the scope of seed farms and implement the fish-farming project in a time-bound manner.

164,2020/01/28,Not enough is known about nCoV epidemiology,"From a thriving port city and an industrial hub in central China, concerns about a viral infection is now spreading across the globe. As Malayalis figure among the most mobile communities around the world, the health authorities here too are on high alert against novel coronavirus (nCoV), which has not been identified previously among humans.

It all began when the virus that caused pneumonia cases in Wuhan City in Hubei Province of China on December 31 last year did not match other known strains.

After a week, the Chinese authorities confirmed that it was a coronavirus, part of a family that causes common cold, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), “not enough is known about the epidemiology of 2019-nCoV to draw definitive conclusions about the full clinical features of disease, the intensity of the human-to-human transmission, and the original source of the outbreak.” They are found to be transmitted between animals and humans.

Several diseases

“These viruses can cause a wide range of diseases from common cold to fatal pneumonia and respiratory issues,” says a list of guidelines prepared by the Health Department. Among newborns and children aged below one, it could cause stomach infection and meningitis. The major symptoms are fever, cold, cough, sore throat, and breathing problems. Later, pneumonia and kidney failure could happen, leading to death.

The infection can spread to those interacting with patients and infected animals and birds. It could be through the droplets coming out when patients sneeze or cough, or through other body fluids. The symptoms may manifest within a period of six to 10 days. Throat swabs, urine, blood and phlegm need to be sent for lab tests.

Screening mechanisms

Vaccines or anti-viral medicines are yet to be made available. The only way of treatment is to reduce the intensity of the infection. Those with serious breathing issues will have to be put on ventilator support. The WHO has called for proper screening mechanisms for international travellers as Wuhan is a major domestic and international transport hub.

P.K. Sunil, member of the Infoclinic group of doctors, pointed out that personal hygiene habits such as frequent handwashing were important preventive steps. Touching eyes, nose and mouth without cleaning hands should be avoided. It is better to cover the face with a handkerchief while sneezing or coughing, he added.

The Health Department has urged people to also avoid spreading false information on the disease. Those with a travel history to affected countries are now subjected to mandatory screening. They will have to stay indoors for at least 28 days.

If symptoms are noticed among relatives, family members or acquaintances, they will have to contact the health staff. People with symptoms should use masks while visiting hospitals and children with such symptoms should not be sent to schools.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7co414/article30644936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINCORONAVIRUS-24jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/not-enough-is-known-about-ncov-epidemiology/article30677970.ece

The construction of two ROBs, at Malikamukku and at Kuthirapanthy, is part of the Alappuzha bypass project. The first girder was fixed at Malikamukku in the early hours of Monday in the presence of officials of Railway and the National Highways Authority of India. Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran said rest of the four girders had been installed in the early hours of Tuesday.

The Minister said that the work to connect the girders at Malikamukku would be completed in two days. The entire project, including the construction of two ROBs, would be completed by April 30.

Girders at Kuthirapanthy

Officials further said that necessary changes were being made on five girders of the second RoB at Kuthirapanthy. “The girders will be provided to Railway authorities for inspection soon. Once the nod is received, we will install it,” said an official.

The Alappuzha bypass project was first mooted four decades ago. However, it had remained on paper until the work got under way on April 10, 2015.

The project, which was set to be completed in September 2017, got delayed on account of various reasons. The deadline was initially extended to May 28, 2018, and further to August 31, 2018. According to officials, the majority of the project has been completed, but the bypass can only be opened to traffic after the completion of the two RoBs.

The 6.8-km two-lane bypass road will link Kommady on the north and Kalarcode on the south, and pass by the western side of the National Highway 66.

169,2020/01/28,It’s a long road to development for Edamalakudy panchayat,"Nothing much has changed in Edamalakudy since the formation of the lone tribal grama panchayat in the State a decade ago. People have to walk a long distance to reach the grama panchayat camp office which still functions at Devikulam to get necessary certificates.

Murugan, a resident of Societykudy where the panchayat office is situated, travelled nearly 35 km to the camp office and got a certificate the same day itself.

Not so lucky

However, those from other remote settlements that are situated deep inside the forest are not as lucky. They have to spend up to three days, for to and fro journey, to get their needs fulfilled from the camp office.

It has been a long cherished dream of the people of the local body to get the services from the panchayat office at Edamalakudy.

Chithappan, member of Edaliparakudy ward, said people often had to stay at Devikulam for meeting their needs at the camp office.

From Pettimudy, it is an 18-km journey to Devikulam. People often walk this distance as the taxi fares are unaffordable for them.

Mr. Chithappan said that they got mobile connectivity only if they reached a spot in the forest on the side of Tamil Nadu. Mobile connectivity was not available in many settlements as they did not come under the limits of the this mobile tower in Tamil Nadu. Another long-pending demand of the people is a proper road from Societykudy to Pettymudy so that urgent medical needs could be met in time.

“Every year, the road is washed away during the monsoon and Edamalakudy is cut off from the outside world,” he said.

Mr. Chithappan said power connection was available only in three of the 12 settlements.

An official at the camp office said that the office functioned at Devikulam as there was no Internet connection at Edamalakudy.

However, he said that the officers occasionally visited Edamalakudy and met the people. It was not possible, however, to go there during the monsoon season, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/its-a-long-road-to-development-for-edamalakudy-panchayat/article30677650.ece
170,2020/01/28,"Reach out to people with service, CM tells police","Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said here on Tuesday that the Kerala police were helpers of helpless and the needy.

Speaking after inaugurating a building constructed by the Kasaragod District Police Co-operative Society on Tuesday, he said that the police in the State had changed a lot from its past self.

“Today, the police are standing up for the innocent and the destitute. At each police station, the police are able to draw up a list of those in need and help. Such actions helped to shift the police force to a more public service-oriented work culture,” he said.

Mr.Vijayan said the police should convince the people with loving attitude that they stood for their protection.

The public would better understand the police if they acted against criminals without discrimination and treated everyone equally before the law and acted impartially, he said.

The Kasaragod District Police Co-operative Society was setting an example for other co-operatives by constructing its own buildings, he said.

Hospital complex

Mr. Vijayan later inaugurated the new multi-storey building of the Kasaragod District Co-operative Hospital at Kumbala.

Speaking on the occasion, he said that cooperative societies which were being trusted by the general public in the health sector, had a lot of potential for further development-oriented interventions.

NITI Ayog of the Central government which had ranked Kerala’s health sector in the first category was as a testimony to its ability to transform government health facilities into accessible medical centres for all people.

The Chief Minister said that the public health sector was getting stronger with the involvement of the Government and the cooperative and private sectors. With primary health centres becoming family centres, the poor and the rich alike were getting the best treatment available, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/reach-out-to-people-with-service-cm-tells-police/article30677581.ece

He was addressing the inauguration of “Sahana Samara March”' organised by the District Congress Committee led by Satheesan Pacheni against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the policies of the Central and State Governments, at Mahe near here. Mr. Chennithala said that there had never been a situation like this in Kerala before. Not just unemployment, but also starvation was on the rise in the State. Kerala was deteriorating to the point where children needed to eat the soil, he said.

Mr. Chennithaa said the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) was a scam. He said that only ₹2,000 crore had been spent in the past out of the ₹50,000-crore project.

172,2020/01/28,Governor may skip CAA remarks in policy address,"Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has indicated that he is likely to skip the State government’s opposition towards the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in his policy address to the Assembly on Wednesday.

Responding to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s reply to his letter of January 25 on the clarification sought by the Raj Bhavan on the draft policy address, Mr. Khan on Tuesday came out against equating the ‘‘policies and programmes of the government with the views of the government” and reiterated that they were “totally different and carry different meanings.”

“By no stretch of imagination, can the term ‘view’ be construed as part of a policy or a programme,” he pointed out to Mr. Vijayan.

Quoting Article 163(2) and 176 (1) of the Constitution, the Governor reiterated that Para 18 of the draft address submitted to him for approval had been rightly described as a view and that it did not qualify to be termed either as policy or programme of the government.

“I am bound by the advice of the Council of Ministers to acquaint the members of the House with the policies and programmes of the government. But, Article 176(1) or the ruling of the Supreme Court does not say that I am bound to give expression to the views of the government which relate to extraneous subjects, which constitutionally speaking, do not come under the jurisdiction of the State government,” the Governor said.

The Chief Minister has been asked to treat the ‘draft as approved on January 25 as the final approved version of the address to the Kerala Legislative Assembly on January 29.’

If the government is of the view that the CAA had substantial ramification on entries in the State List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution such as Public Order, the Governor said, the case should be submitted to him separately as required under Section 34 (2) iii of the Rules of Business of the Government of Kerala.

Mr. Khan invoked sub rule (c) and (d) of Rule 119 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Kerala Assembly which placed a bar on discussing any subject which was either sub judice or did not come under the jurisdiction of the State government.

Quoting Article 163 (2) and ruling of the Supreme Court, the Governor said that he could act in his “discretion” if the exercise of function was beyond the purview of the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers but was by or under the Constitution.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-may-skip-caa-remarks-in-policy-address/article30676788.ece
173,2020/01/28,Arrear settlement adalats soon for industrialists: Jayarajan,"Minister for Industries E.P. Jayarajan has said that arrears settlement adalats would be organised for industrialists from February with a view to turning Kanjikode into the biggest industrial city in the State.

The government will waive the fine for defaulting the repayment for those who took loans from the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation and the Industrial Department. The interest collected from the industrialists will never cross the principal loan amount, he said.

The Minister was speaking after visiting the Kinfra Industrial Park here on Tuesday. The visit was to assess the issues being faced by the Kanjikode industrial area and to expedite the move for land takeover for the Kochi-Coimbatore industrial corridor.

He said Palakkad had immense potential to develop into an industrial city. The government is trying to bring in more investors and industrialists, he said, adding that the individual issues of the industrialists would be solved at the personal level and the public issues at the trade union level.

Kinfra managing director Santhosh Koshi Thomas and central zonal head Murali Krishnan and several other officials accompanied Mr. Jayarajan.

Addressing an interface programme organised by the Kanjikode Industrial Forum, the Minister said that an academy would be opened in the State for smoothening Kerala’s industrial growth and for the benefit of industrialists and entrepreneurs.

Equal importance

He said trade and commerce was equally important as industry for the State. A marketing company will be formed with Sushil Khanna as its chairman to explore the possibilities in commerce.

174,2020/01/28,Coronavirus: State on battle mode,"The Health department has requested people who have returned to the State from China to voluntarily report themselves at the department so that they can be guided properly on the precautions that they should necessarily take, while being on home quarantine for the next 28 days.

The Health department is on a high state of alert and while the situation was right now very much under control, everyone needed to maintain utmost caution, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja told media persons here on Tuesday.

Ms. Shylaja, who chaired a review meeting of the control room opened at the Health department, said it was very important that asymptomatic people with a recent travel history to China did not see the home quarantine as a forced restriction.

They would need to take home quarantine guidelines of the Health department seriously and totally avoid public places because of the new revelation by China that asymptomatic people could also be spreading the disease. If at all they develop any cold-like symptoms while on quarantine, they should immediately get in touch with the DISHA helpline (1056/0471-2552056).

Control rooms have been opened in all districts, and quarantine guidelines and those related to the precautions, respiratory hygiene, and cough etiquette to be maintained have been disseminated right down to the primary health centres.

633 persons on quarantine

A total of 633 persons with a recent travel history to China are currently on quarantine in the State and under strict observation of the Health department. Of the 16 who have so far been admitted in isolation wards in hospitals with mild flu-like symptoms, all except seven have been discharged.

Ms. Shylaja said six samples out of the 10 (of hospitalised persons) sent to NIV Pune has tested negative for Coronavirus (nCoV). Health department was following the guidelines issued by the ICMR and the Centre, and all emergency preparedness measures in hospitals had been initiated. Screening of passengers, which had been initiated at Kochi airport, will now be done at Thiruvananthapuram also.

She said that the Health department as well as the office of the CM were in touch with the Malayali students stranded in China. While the State expressed concern for their safety, given the current situation when quarantine rules of their host country could not be violated, it was up to the Centre to take a call on if and how they could be evacuated.

A lot of medical students from Kerala were in Wuhan, the epicentre of the current epidemic, and it does pose a special situation if all of them were to be brought into the State, Ms. Shylaja admitted.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-state-on-battle-mode/article30676348.ece
175,2020/01/28,"18th Kerala Assembly to figure out CAA, fiscal crisis","The deepening resentment at the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the internecine feud between Governor Arif Mohammed Khan and the government and Opposition are set to resonate in the 18th session of the Assembly that commences on Wednesday.

The budget session opens at a time when the State is caught in the vortex of the anti-CAA agitation and an acute resource crunch that is threatening to stall the functioning of the treasury.

Policy address

The government has taken a strident stance against the objections of Mr. Khan to the references to the CAA in the policy address, but has refused to budge from its stated position to expunge it to his satisfaction. The Opposition also toughened its stance against Mr. Khan.

It remains to be seen whether Mr. Khan will read or skip such portions in the address. Either way, it would not have any impact since it has been conclusively ruled that the address cleared by the Cabinet alone will be treated as valid.

UDF resolution

Also, the notice on a resolution moved by the Opposition demanding the President to recall Mr. Khan is awaiting approval. Though the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) has attempted to project the resolution as the touchstone to test the genuineness of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s stance against Mr. Khan, the government seems to have sensed the ploy and is treading cautiously.

The mass protest organised by the LDF against the CAA and the participation of members of minority communities, including Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), are set to figure in the course of discussions. The public pronouncements of certain IUML and senior Congress leaders on going hand-in-hand with the LDF in such protests would put the UDF on the defensive.

The UDF would flag the arrest of two CPI(M) activists from Pantheerankavu in Kozhikode invoking the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and the divergent views aired by some CPI(M) leaders on the issue to confront the government.

The financial curbs imposed by the Centre, the drastic cut in Central transfers under various heads, including GST compensation, and the reported threat raised against fiscal federalism would also dominate the discussions.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hhkdvb/article30678445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TVTV-ASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/caa-fiscal-crisis-to-figure-in-house/article30675653.ece

United Democratic Front (UDF) convener Benny Behanan, MP, told reporters here on Tuesday that senior Congress leaders Oommen Chandy and K.C. Venugopal; Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran will participate.

The UDF will organise a “human map of India” (manushya bhoopadam) in other districts across Kerala on the day to protest against the CAA. Thousands of UDF supporters would join the human map at designated locations in each district, Mr. Behanan said.

Playgrounds, including Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium, Kaloor, would be used for the protest, he said.

Senior Congress leader A.K. Antony will participate in Thiruvuanthapuram, while UDF leaders such as V.M. Sudheeran, Shibu Baby John, P.J. Joseph, Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan and M.K. Muneer will form part of the human map.

The UDF convener said there was no controversy over reports that some Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) members had participated in the human chain organised by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) on Sunday against the CAA. This was not an issue to be discussed or argued over now. The issue was that democracy and secularism were under threat in India and all those who opposed these developments should protest against it, Mr. Behanan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rahul-to-lead-long-march-in-wayanad/article30675614.ece

The placements offers have been rolled out by 131 recruiters to 413 students in five days. The top 50% of the students bagged an average cost to company of ₹26.69 lakh per annum, a 12.5% increase from last year.

Speaking on the placements of the flagship MBA programme, Debashis Chatterjee, Director, IIM-K, said here on Tuesday that technology was reshaping education and the edu-tech sector was becoming the prime recruiter and a formidable force in attracting talent.

Shovan Chowdhury, Chairperson (Placements), said the institute had witnessed another successful completion of final placements for its largest batch despite the negative sentiment of the job market.

180,2020/01/28,"Analysis | LDF buoyed by response to anti-CAA protest, determined to sustain its tempo","The high-voltage campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) mounted by the political parties, predominantly the Left Democratic Front, seems to have made a profound political impact in Kerala.

The angst of the minorities, both Muslims and Christians, got reflected in a human chain formed at the behest of the LDF across the State on Sunday evening. Along with others, members of both communities reached the venues in hordes to participate in the protest.

More importantly, a large number of mosques and churches under the Kerala Regional Latin Catholic Council (KRLCC) read the Preamble of the Constitution and also delivered sermons on the danger of the nation compromising on its secular credentials through the amendment.

The LDF and the State government seem to be buoyed over the public response to the chain and are determined to sustain its tempo in the coming days.

Organisations of the Muslim community were the first to publicly react against the CAA, but in due course the KRLCC that claims to have a following of about 30 lakh too joined the course in full steam. A lion’s share of the following of the KRLCC comprises the fishing community and they seem to have woken up to the political reality more than the other denominations.

The Syro Malabar church is yet to crystallise its stance. The lone voice of protest against the Act was raised by the seniormost Archbishop, Joseph Powathil who is known to respond to issues of public interest. He lashed out against the Act, while others chose to remain silent.

Mosques all over the State raised the tricolour to mark the Republic Day, rather a unique gesture, in the morning and the overwhelming participation of members of both communities in the human chain formed on the national highway across the State in the evening was a clear response to the campaign launched by the LDF against the Act.

Though the protests were launched jointly by both fronts in the initial stage, the UDF gradually backed out fearing it would be seen as playing second fiddle to its political foe in a bipolar polity and announced the decision to traverse its own course.

While the UDF remained a divided house, the LDF meticulously ironed out its strategy and succeeded in disseminating a message that the chain was planned to protect the secular fabric and had no hidden electoral or other interests.

This pronouncement gained more acceptability for the campaign amongst those sections that have been maintaining a distance from the LDF and were rather persuaded to join the protest in full swing.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/l0yn8j/article30657577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KeralaHumanChain,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/analysis-ldf-buoyed-by-response-to-anti-caa-protest-determined-to-sustain-its-tempo/article30669026.ece

183,2020/01/28,Chief Minister inaugurates Gadhika fair,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said that Gadhika was a festival of hope for the Scheduled Tribes.

Fairs such as this would help them sell their products. Speaking after inaugurating the 10-day Gadhika Folk Art Fair and Product Fair at the Kannur collectorate stadium, he said Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities found it difficult to access markets for the products of their unique traditional art. The State Government was organising Gadhika fairs to solve this problem.

The Government had taken a non-compromising approach to the welfare of the two communities. As part of this, training in modern technology and innovation, programmes in education, nutrition and health care were conducted.

The Government’s project, “Gothra Bandhu” to sensitise them to the importance of education and provide them with primary education in the tribal languages was a huge success, he said. As part of this, teachers from the Scheduled Tribe communities were recruited in LP classes. The Government had set up 125 government-run social study rooms to facilitate the enrolment of SC students.

184,2020/01/28,Govt. may inform Governor that CAA will remain in policy address,"The State government has reportedly decided to inform Governor Arif Mohammad Khan that his concerns about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as mentioned in the draft policy address sent for his approval were misplaced.

Mr. Khan had counselled the government to revise the draft after he felt the matter could be sub judice as the Supreme Court was considering several appeals against the Central law.

Officials said the government felt the CAA had caused much public angst.

A vast majority felt the law was patently anti-Muslim and chipped away at the secular core of the Constitution.

The Assembly had passed a unanimous resolution urging the Centre to repeal the law after gauging the public mood.

The government felt that there was nothing unconstitutional in expressing the collective will of the House in the matter in the policy address to be delivered by Mr. Khan at the start of the budget session of the Assembly on January 31.

Face-off on cards

The government’s decision not to revise the draft policy address as counselled by Mr. Khan has possibly set the stage for another round of politically charged face-off with the Governor over the CAA.

The move also has the potential to reignite the row between the Governor and the government over the right of the Assembly to pass a resolution against a Central law.

Meanwhile, the government has also reportedly decided not to back Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala’s demand to introduce a motion in the House seeking the recall of Mr. Khan on the ground that he recurrently assailed the dignity of the House and undermined the parliamentary privilege of members by repeatedly stating in public that legislators had no business passing an opinion on the CAA.

Mr. Chennithala had also written to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stating that the policy address should compulsorily reflect the “essence” of the anti-CAA resolution unanimously adopted by the House.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-may-inform-governor-that-caa-will-remain-in-policy-address/article30669646.ece

186,2020/01/28,Assembly to go digital with Governor’s address,"The Legislative Assembly will enter the digital era with the policy address of Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on January 29.

The Governor’s address will be displayed on the digital screen kicking off the first phase of the project of making the Assembly paperless. The presentation of the budget by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac will also be displayed on the digital screen on February 7. The Governor’s policy address and the Budget will be displayed on the screen once the page of the document they are reading is turned.

In five phases

Initially, the question hour, calling attention, and submission will go digital. The software ‘e-Niyamasabha’ and the related equipment for the digitisation is being fine-tuned. However, the session will be a mix of digital and paper as the digitisation process will only be completed in five phases.

The goal is to make the Assembly paperless by July, Secretary, Legislative Assembly, S.V. Unnikrishnan Nair said while introducing the concept to mediapersons on Monday.

A training room has been set up in the Assembly building to familiarise MLAs with touchscreen and other procedures.

187,2020/01/28,KPCC proposes committee to enforce discipline,"The newly reconstituted Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) has decided to crack the whip on indiscipline in the party. It has proposed a “disciplinary committee” to enforce the party line.

The KPCC that convened here on Monday stressed the need to curb combative statements and opinionated social media posts by party members.

The decision had the seal of approval of the All India Congress Committee (AICC). It was taken in the presence of KPCC president Mullappally Ramachandran, Congress Working Committee member A.K. Antony, AICC general secretaries K.C. Venugopal and Oommen Chandy, and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala.

Mr. Venugopal informed the meeting that the AICC did not take kindly to public war of words and acidic comments that targeted leaders or cast aspersions on the party’s decision-making process.

‘Wrong impression’

Such verbal squabbles conveyed the wrong impression that the party was in a permanent state of revolt in Kerala.

Later at a press conference, Mr. Ramachandran countered criticism from within his own party that the KPCC had accommodated Mohan Sankar, who had contested on the BJP ticket from Kollam in the Lok Sabha elections, as a vice-president without due deliberations.

He said he “sympathised” with K. Muraleedharan, MP, for passing such a judgement on Mr. Mohan’s nomination process. He said the fact that Mr. Mohan hailed from the backward class Ezhava community and was the son of R. Sankar, the first Congress Chief Minister of Kerala, weighed politically in his favour.

The AICC had also resolved to give adequate representation to Dalits, backward castes and minorities in its official hierarchy. The KPCC had just followed the AICC’s directions. Former party chief Rahul Gandhi will lead a Congress “long march” against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Wayanad on January 30.

188,2020/01/28,Filmmakers allege ‘backdoor censorship’ at Mumbai film festival,"Film-makers Anand Patwardhan and Pankaj Rishi Kumar along with others on Tuesday alleged “backdoor censorship” and “absolute control exercised from Delhi” in the selection of films to be screened at the 16th edition of the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF 2020).

Addressing a press conference, hours before the start of the festival, they also shared short clips and details of the films “rejected” by MIFF 2020. Pankaj Rishi Kumar’s Janani’s Juliet, Anand Patwardhan’s Reason/Vivek, Deepti Gupta’s Shut Up Sona are three of the significant films that have not been found suitable for screening.

Pankaj Rishi Kumar’s Janani’s Juliet, a searing look at caste politics through the rehearsals and performance of an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, won the Best Long Documentary prize at the International Documentary and Short Film Festival of Kerala ( IDSFFK).

Anand Patwardhan’s Reason/Vivek, that examines the systematic dismantling of the ideals of secular democracy in India, had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival and won the Best Feature Documentary award at the renowned International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam(IDFA).

Deepti Gupta’s Shut Up Sona on the outspoken singer Sona Mohapatra’s fight against sexual discrimination and harassment and for an equal space for women, is in the official line-up of the on-going International Film Festival of Rotterdam(IFFR).

However, these three are just a few of the significant films that have not been found suitable for screening at the Mumbai International Film Festival that kicked off on Tuesday.

MIFF is the oldest and largest biennial film festival of non feature films in South Asia and is organised by Films Division of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.

It was launched in 1990 as Bombay International Film Festival. One of its highlights was that it did away with the requirement of censor certificates. Many Indian films critical of government policies and ideologies were not only selected in MIFF but even won awards. Among them were Patwardhan’s own In Memory of Friends, critical of the government’s role during anti-Sikh riots and sectarian violence in Punjab and Ranjan Palit and Vasudha Joshi’s Voices of Baliapal highlighting protests against a missile base in Orissa. Patwardhan even won the Dr V Shantaram lifetime achievement award for contribution to documentary film movement in India at the same festival in 2014.

According to the film-makers it was in 2003, in the wake of the Gujarat carnage of 2002, that a censor requirement for Indian films at MIFF was introduced. As a counter to it, film-makers successfully mounted a popular protest festival called Vikalp. The censorship clause at MIFF was then withdrawn and stayed off the agenda. But by 2016 it started becoming increasingly clear that films critical of the ruling ideology would just not get selected in MIFF.

This year the prominent films that have been overlooked include Pradeep K.P. (Deepu)’s Our Gauri that follows the political journey of late Gauri Lankesh and her fight against right-wing communal forces. The week-long festival of documentary, short, fiction and animation films that starts today will conclude on February 3. Sunil Kumar’s Ammi is on student Najeeb’s disappearance on October 15, 2016 from the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus, New Delhi, and the lack of progress in the investigations by the various investigating agencies. Deepa Dhanraj’s We have not come here to die, is about students all over the country breaking the silence around their experiences of caste discrimination in universities and the start of anti-caste movement in the wake of the suicide by dalit Phd research scholar and activist Rohith Vemula.

Even films slightly against the philosophy of those in power have been rejected by the “sanskari panel,” alleged Mr. Patwardhan. A film on the syncretic culture of Delhi, Yousef’s Saeed’s Dilli Yadon ki Mehfil couldn’t pass muster. Neither could Vani Subramaniam’s take against death penalty--The Death of Us.

According to Pankaj Rishi Kumar it is part of the larger agenda to control every institution. “They are not interested in arts and culture… In the future films won’t be made, save by the bhakts,” he said tongue in cheek.

The filmmakers also highlighted that 23 hours of time reserved for competition films in the festival has been brought down steadily by about 8 hours, that the RTI to MIFF on the selection was not responded to because of some small technicality and that some of the administrators’ own films have been selected for the festival.

Kumar and Patwardhan had filed a petition in the Bombay High Court asking the government to show cause as to why their films were rejected from all categories at MIFF. “While the case has now been withdrawn due to technical reasons, we are still gathering information on other acclaimed films left out of MIFF 2020,” said a press statement. The filmmakers said that they believed in democracy and fighting through constitutional means. They may plan on screening the films individually or collectively. “But they can crack down on a parallel festival too,” says Patwardhan.

Two letter of support from international filmmakers and former members of MIFF jury were also shared with the press. These are by Mark Achbar - Head of Jury, MIFF 2014 and Silver Conch winner MIFF 1994 for the film “Manufacturing Consent” (a film on Noam Chomsky) and Nicolas Philibert – Golden Conch Winner (In the Land of the Deaf) MIFF 1994 and Jury member, MIFF 2004. “It will be a dent on the reputation of the festival. International filmmakers may not come for a government controlled festival,” said Patwardhan.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gctsa0/article30677765.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANANDPATWARDHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/filmmakers-allege-backdoor-censorship-at-mumbai-film-festival/article30677766.ece
189,2020/01/28,Joaquin Phoenix’s ‘Joker’ to re-release in India on February 14,"Joaquin Phoenix’s “Joker”, which has become an award-season favourite, will be re-released in India on February 14.

Todd Phillips along with Phoenix turned the story of a mentally unstable loner and failed comedian Arthur Fleck, who picks violence to find calmness in his life, into a blockbuster. It was earlier released in India on October 2, 2019.

Now given the massive Oscar buzz around the film with 11 nominations including Best Actor, Best Film and Director, Warner Bros. Pictures will re-release the film for the Indian audiences on February 14, four days after the Oscar awards ceremony.

AThe makers believe that re-releasing “Joker” will not only draw new audiences to the theatre but is also expected to garner a momentous repeat footfall.

“Joker” is going to re-release in cities of Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, Gurgaon, Noida, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune, Ernakulam, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Mysore, Ahmedabad, Coimbatore amongst other cities.

Phillips’ “Joker”, an origin story about superhero Batman’s biggest enemy Joker, got 11A Oscar nods, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor. Other categories are: Cinematography, Adapted Screenplay, Costume Design, Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, Original Score, Film Editing and Make-up and Hairstyling.

“Joker” tells the story of the popular DC supervillain of the same name. The film traces the protagonist’s early life as Arthur Fleck (essayed by Phoenix), who is an aspiring stand-up comedian struggling to make ends meet and constantly derided by society. The film narrates how circumstances push Fleck into the path of crime after he fails to find his way in Gotham’s fractured society.

The Warner Bros. project has become the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time, and has crossed the $1 billion mark at the worldwide box office. In fact, the impact is deep as it has sparked conversation around mental health. A follow-up to film is also in the works.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3e1e2e/article30675068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/joker,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/joaquin-phoenixs-joker-to-re-release-in-india-on-february-14/article30675069.ece
190,2020/01/28,"The trigger for the story of Naga Shaurya’s ‘Aswathama’ is the Nirbhaya incident, says director Ramana Teja","At 26, Ramana Teja will be making his debut as a director with the Telugu film Aswathama, starring Naga Shaurya and Mehreen Kaur Pirzada, that is scheduled to release on January 31. He narrates how he swam against the tide to become a director.

“I was interested in films since my V std and I remember the post-mortem of movies my father would indulge in after returning from the theatre. I was a silent participant; films influenced me subconsciously but I continued with academics,” he says.

While studying engineering in Chennai, he shot a short film on his mobile. The Tamil film Raja Rani starring Nayantara spurred his interest to join films and he began working as an assistant director in Gaddam Gang, the Rajashekar-starrer which was a remake of the Tamil film Soodhu Kavvum. “Before that, I interned for Soodhu Kavvum for a month without my parents knowledge. When I heard that the same film is being remade, I contacted Jeevita Rajashekar and worked as an AD in Hyderabad,” shares Teja.

It was in Hyderabad that Teja learnt everything from scratch and got to know about all the departments. His parents sensed his interest in films and sent him to the U.S. to study Business Management. There, he applied to a film school to learn screenplay writing and got busy studying both the subjects. Eventually he got both degrees.

Teja observes, “What I learnt in India about cinema is different from that I learnt in the US. A sequence can be written in seven different ways. I had the chance to intern for a few films. After returning to India, I didn’t find many opportunities and I also lost contacts during those three and a half years.”

During that phase, he met many producers who wanted him to direct films with a small budget, but he had decided to direct a film only if it has a reasonable budget. While seeking opportunities, Teja got into a digital promotional company as a content writer; there he met Naga Shaurya who had approached the company for the promotions of his film, Chalo. His interactions with Shaurya helped him strike a rapport.

Teja goes down memory lane and recalls, “One fine day he (Shaurya) told me he had a story that he had written; I heard it and kept giving inputs. He said he wanted me to direct it. I am a screenplay writer and since I was looking for an opportunity, I agreed. Shaurya wrote the story and Phani and I developed the screenplay.”

The trigger point of the story is the Nirbhaya incident that disturbed the country. The film goads women to be conscious and aware of what’s happening around them. It is an emotional action film and Shaurya is not playing a vigilante.

Teja shares, “We took cinematic liberties to execute the narration. An incident in the family spurs violence but here he is speaking for all. When the Draupadi disrobing happened, the Kauravas were questioned by Aswathama (Dronacharya’s son who supported Kauravas in the war). He took moral responsibility for the incident, told them they were wrong, because of which he got to live longer.”

Ask Teja about the poster where an infant is clutching the hero’s hand. He hints at the protection a newborn girl child seeks right from the time she is in the womb. Naga Shaurya is so far known for soft, romantic roles and an action detour Jadoogadu misfired. But Teja affirms that this time, the anger is accompanied by action, and the story warrants it, and it will not go wrong.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/6na61h/article30674356.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TDP9795,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-trigger-for-the-story-of-naga-shauryas-aswathama-is-the-nirbhaya-incident-says-director-ramana-teja/article30674357.ece
191,2020/01/28,Srikakulam dialect to the fore in ‘Sittharala Sirapadu’ from ‘Ala Vaikunthapuramuloo’,"The songs in Ala Vaikunthapuramuloo were an instant hit as soon as they were released, long before the film was. However, one song was not released and when it did, it won encomiums from movie buffs as well as those fond of poetry. And that’s ‘Sittarala Siripadu’ written by Vijay Kumar Balla in the climax of the film.

Written in Srikakulam dialect, Sittarala Siripadu was innovatively choreographed, to an action sequence that showed the hero beating the pulp out of the villains in a seemingly casual manner, to the rhythm of the song. That came as a surprise to the audience.

How did it all begin? Director Trivikram Srinivas who is related to lyricist Seetarama Sastry was on the lookout for someone who could write a song in the Uttarandhra dialect. After the non-professional writer Vijay Kumar got down to the job, he wrapped up the entire song within an hour.

Vijay Kumar is an IT manager at LIC in Machilipatanam. Hailing from Odisha Jeypore on the Srikakulam border, he has a grip on the local dialect. Says Vijay, that he hardly watches films and has no connections with the film industry before Ala... However, he had written a song post- Hud hud cyclone devastation — hoping to regain the lost glory of Visakhapatnam. That song was aired on AIR and widely applauded. But he says, he never expected to write for a film one day.

He shares, “I am not a professional writer. For Ala Vaikunthapuramuloo, I was asked if there are any hero-centric songs in Srikakulam mandalikam (dialect). I got in touch with a few folklore experts for that but those songs didn’t fall in place. Then I began writing four charanams and was told to continue with another four. I wrote it within an hour. Next day, Trivikram called and thanked me for writing it all within an hour. The director asked me to come over for coffee.”

Vijay was so excited, he took selfies with Trivikram, showed him the ghazal and other songs he had written; all were noted down by the director’s team.

Vijay Kumar Balla

He recalls his conversation with Trivikram, “He narrated the episode where a girl is walking on the road and a few wastrels are following her. The hero beats them up, and there is a kaanthi (spark) in her eyes. I should write a song in a meter for that situation, he told me. Sittaralu indicates vichitram (wonderful) and Sirapadu means a youngster who keeps attempting different things, it’s like a pet name. The last charanam was cinematic. Ponnuru is a village and there are some complicated words like Guddhi Gunda Chesinaadu which means he beat them with his fist and turned them into powder. If you analyse you will find it easy to understand. The director also asked me to use a boat, but I used a Sorachepa (shark) instead, he found that catchy.”

Looking back

After completion of the film, Vijay was thrilled that in every interview, Trivikram was mentioning the writer’s contribution. Yet he was worried and confused about why his song was not being released. His shares, “I didn’t bother to find out why my song was being kept a secret; I thought they might be having their problems. Then, when I saw my name on the screen, I was very happy. I always had a desire to act in a street play; instead, my song is doing the job. Thaman did a fine job of composing the tunes and Sorranna and Saketh sang it wonderfully.”

Vijay would teach songs to his agents as lessons. Though he rues that songs and poetry in Telangana get their due recognition and Srikakulam mandalikam is ignored, he is optimistic. People will surely preserve the dialect even though stalwarts like Vangapandu Prasad Rao who sang for films, faded into oblivion.

Vijay cites an example of the dialect’s sounds, “It is still pure. They don’t say La…they say Na and it goes ‘Night antha night yesarandi’ which means there are two nights in the sentence. Actually, the second night is light. There is a beauty in it and problems too with understanding this dialect.” He reflects, “Words are changing and so is the usage; English words have become common. The Telugu language is in a precarious situation because of politicians. Wonder what would be the future of mandalikam?”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/azemoh/article30674304.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy28Ala-stilla,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/srikakulam-dialect-to-the-fore-in-sittharala-sirapadu-from-ala-vaikunthapuramuloo/article30674308.ece

196,2020/01/28,MGR wanted to make ‘Ponniyin Selvan’ with Kamal Haasan and Sridevi,"There have been several failed attempts to adapt Ponniyin Selvan — the five-volume historical novel written by Kalki Krishnamoorthy — into a movie. According to a report in The Hindu in 2011, it was MG Ramachandran who first announced that he would produce Ponniyin Selvan with an ensemble cast in 1958. The project, however, never took off. In the early 2000s, the Nayakan duo, Mani Ratnam and Kamal Haasan, was contemplating the idea of working together, to realise their dream of adapting the same. But their passion project was dropped, only to be revived by Mani Ratnam again in 2019, with a fresh set of actors.

With Ponniyin Selvan currently in the works, veteran filmmaker P Bharathiraja shared an interesting trivia about the movie, during the promotions of his upcoming directorial Meendum Oru Mariyathai.

Bharathiraja recalled the time when he was shooting for the song Ponmane Kobam Yeno for Oru Kaidhiyin Diary, when MGR, who was staying at Tamil Nadu House, visited him on the sets. “He came to the shooting spot and asked, ‘Who’s the master?’ I shyly said it was me. He looked at me and said, ‘I asked about dance master’,” laughed Bharathiraja, adding, “He was looking to produce a movie for his MGR Pictures and said that he wanted me to direct Ponniyin Selvan. I was shocked. I politely asked him what he meant. He said, ‘You should direct it for me and Kamal Haasan and Sridevi should act in it’.”

Bharathiraja added that the three of them gave the nod. However, MGR left to America on the sixth day after that conversation, he said. “Otherwise, I would have made Ponniyin Selvan. I remember reading it when I was in class 10. It’s an epic. I don’t know how he [Mani Ratnam] is going to do it. But Mani has the capacity to pull off.”

197,2020/01/28,"Vignettes from '83' poster launch: Jiiva on playing 'Chika', Kapil Dev recounts meeting Indira Gandhi, and more","Smoking kills. In Jiiva’s case, an unmindful drag caused such consternation that it forced the evacuation of a multi-storey luxury hotel in Scotland.

The actor, who plays Krishnamachari Srikkanth on celluloid in Kabir Khan’s upcoming film 83, was at Sathyam Cinemas, along with the rest of cast and crew, during the weekend, for the movie’s poster launch, when he shared some lesser-known stories from the shoot spot. After being cast to play Chika (as Srikkanth is called in cricketing circles), Jiiva was in Scotland to film 83 in mid-2019.

“I had to film a sequence where I smoke like Chika. We weren’t allowed to smoke in public, so when we headed to the hotel, I lit one up. About three minutes in, the fire alarm went off and the hotel staff said we must evacuate the building. This incident happened after the first day’s shoot,” Jiiva said, adding, “We were on the 19th floor and I saw everyone including old people getting down the hotel. I saw Kabir and the rest of the cast, and they were asking... ‘Who smoked?’. I confessed but I learnt later that a lot of others were also culprits that day.”

Jiiva turned around to look at actor Ranveer Singh and the rest of the 83 cast, all of whom could only bear a sheepish look on their faces, as soon as he said this.

But the actor remarked that he was uncertain of his ability to play Chika, when initially approached by Kabir Khan. “After that incident in the hotel, I believed I could be Chika... for creating the chaos,” he laughed. Interestingly, when he met Chika for tips to incorporate while filming, Jiiva recollected that he only had one piece of advice. “Chika told me, ‘Dai Jiiva... Kanna moodittu suthu da. Patta bhagyam padalena legyam!’” (Hey Jiiva, just swing at the ball with your eyes closed. With some luck you will hit it).

Where’s my mysore pak? Meanwhile, Deepika Padukone won the Internet when she commented on a post by husband Ranveer Singh, who was visiting Chennai for promoting his upcoming 83. The actor had shared a poster titled ‘Kapil’s Devils storm Chennai!’ that fetched several compliments from fans, but all Deepika had to say was: “Don’t come back without 1kg Mysore Pak from Shree Krishna and 2 1/2kg packets of Spicy Potato Chips from Hot Chips!” Deepika’s shopping list has won over foodies on the Internet and is being widely circulated among fans.

Yet, this wasn’t even the funniest of recollections that night. Former India captain Kapil Dev wound time back to the time when Chika met then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the early 1980s. “Srikkanth always winked,” Kapil said, before going on to mimic Chika. “So, us senior players told him that Madam Indira Gandhi was going to come meet us, and that he was not allowed to wink at her. I was taking her down the line-up and Chika was next to Sunil Gavaskar. Now, anyone who meets Gavaskar would take that 30 seconds extra to interact with him. The moment I introduced Chika, he started winking left, right and centre at her,” Kapil added, to roaring laughter from the audience and film crew.

“After she left, we confronted Chika and told him, you cannot wink like that at the Prime Minister, and he says ‘well, she started it first’,” Kapil laughed.

Ever the showboat, Ranveer Singh — who headlines the star cast of 83 playing Kapil Dev — marked his entry by jumping onto the stage the minute his name was called out amid rapturous reception. “I don’t think there is a more glorious chapter in our sporting history than the story of the 1983 World Cup. This will be the definitive film on the greatest story ever told, and to have the opportunity to play Kapil Dev, and to be a part of this experience... it is a trip,” he said.

The film will be dubbed into Telugu and Tamil; actor Akkineni Nagarjuna’s Annapurna Studios and actor Kamal Haasan’s Raaj Kamal Films International have bought the respective language rights.

198,2020/01/28,Rejection of movies at MIFF: two filmmakers withdraw plea in HC,"Two filmmakers on Monday withdrew their petition before the Bombay High Court concerning the rejection of three of their films by the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF) after the court explained its limitations in terms of jurisdiction.

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing a plea filed by award-winning filmmakers Anand Patwardhan and Pankaj Kumar about the non-selection of their documentaries — Vivek/Reason, Janini’s Juliet and Two Flags — for the 16th edition of MIFF.

Vivek plays out over eight chapters that document a particular political ideology’s ascendancy in recent times. The film covers the murders of rationalists such as Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare, M.M. Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh, and investigates the connection of these crimes to the various sectarians outfits. It also looks at the violent attacks on Muslims and Dalits in the name of cow protection, the caste-based discrimination that led to the suicide of the young student leader and scholar, Rohith Vemula, and numerous outbursts of violence, connecting them to present an overview of the turmoil that India is presently witnessing.

Janani’s Juliet is a story of a Puducherry-based theatre group, Indianostrum, which introspects the implications of caste, class and gender in the wake of honour killings. Two Flags is based on life and politics in Puducherry.

Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, representing the Films Division of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that organises the festival, explained the selection process of the films, and said the films were rejected after a scrutiny by the selection committee.

He said, “There is a committee comprising expert filmmakers working independently and the government has no role to play in the selection of movies.”

The court interrupted and said, “The impression is that so long as the documentary is critical of the current political dispensation, it will not be allowed to be screened.”

The court further said, “Suppose today there is a film made on the current student unrest, now if you try to stop it, with social media you will not be able to do it. It will get more publicity all over the world.” Justice Dharmadhikari said, “We should not inflict further damage to India by not accepting a contrary view. People who voice a contrary view feel they are targeted and hence are excluded. You (government) should also give them a platform.”

However, Mr. Singh said, in this case, it was a competition and if out of so many films, their (the petitioner’s) films were rejected then there must be films better than these three films.

The court then said, “You should have an open dialogue with people. Courts need not be bothered for everything. You may have an expectation, but it is not a right (to be selected).”

199,2020/01/28,Retired IPS officer T. Rajendran promoted to DGP rank,"The State Government has issued orders granting a notional promotion to retired IPS officer T. Rajendran of the 1983 batch, elevating him to the rank of Director-General of Police.

Though the former Chennai Police Commissioner had been eligible for promotion, the State Government did not convene screening committee meetings to initiate the process in 2014/15 despite vacancies. The officer had to retire in the rank of Additional Director-General of Police on December 31, 2015. Mr. Rajendran later moved the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) which ruled that he could be considered for a notional promotion.

While the notional promotion and consequent fixation of pay in the relevant cadre of DGP would be counted for fixation of pension and retirement benefits, he would not be entitled to any back wages. Following the CAT order, the State issued orders granting the notional promotion.

During his 32-year career, Mr. Rajendran served as Commissioner of Police, Chennai (2009-11) and ADGP, Law & Order (2008-09) and also served the State Intelligence in various capacities. The sensational kidnap for ransom case involving school boy Keerthivasan, Nemichand murder, Shanmugasundaram shootout incident etc. were some of the cases handled by him as city police chief. It was during his tenure as the Inspector-General of Police (South Zone) that dreaded Islamic fundamentalist Imam Ali and four of his associates were shot dead by a special team in Bengaluru.

Following a backlash on social media, the party deleted the tweet. ​

​A photograph in which the National Conference leader, who usually has a clean shaven look, was sporting an unkempt beard, had led to leaders such as West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee and DMK leader M. K. Stalin expressing shock recently. Mr Abdullah has been in detention since before Article 370 was abrogated.​

​Against this backdrop, the State BJP tweeted, “Dear OmarAbdullah, it’s very disheartening to see you like this while most of your corrupt friends are enjoying life outside. Kindly accept our sincere contribution, in case of any assistance, feel free to contact ur counterpart @incindia for further help in this regard”. An image of a consignment of razors booked on an online shopping portal and addressed to Mr. Abdullah was also attached. ​

​However, the party had to quickly backtrack and delete the tweet following strong criticism over the insensitivity of the tweet. ​

201,2020/01/28,Befriending Tamil through Brahmi,"In an initiative aimed at popularising the ancient Tamil script, a Karur-based educational group has set aside 30 minutes of class time daily to teach students the Tamizhi (Tamil-Brahmi) script.

About 300-odd teachers of the Bharani group of institutions had learnt the script before they started teaching it to students. The teachers, who have become familiar with the script, now spend some time reading and writing in the Tamizhi script every day.

The institution began the system since the reopening of schools after the Christmas vacation. Irrespective of periods allotted for various subjects, the teachers allot a minimum of 5 minutes for teaching the Tamizhi script.

Within three weeks of teaching, about 2,500 out of 5,500 students have learnt how to read inscriptions in the script. Many can also write the script.

“It is very interesting to learn the script. Every teacher spends some time on teaching the ancient Tamil letters before switching on to their respective subjects. Now, I am well versed in Tamizhi,” says B. Jasvarshini, a Class VIII student. V. Kowsalya, another Class VIII student said that it had kindled her interest on ancient Tamil inscriptions. She could read and understand the inscriptions found on temples and stones, she said.

C. Ramasubramanian, Senior Principal, Bharani Park institutions, told The Hindu that it was an attempt to teach the rudiments of popularising and deciphering Tamil inscriptions to students. Nearly, 50% of the students in Bharani Vidyalaya and Bharani Park Matriculation School have become familiar with the Tamizhi script. They could write in the script too, he said.

“Reading and interpreting mediaeval Tamil inscriptions is a skill that only a few have. The skill has not reached the general public in the State. If they learnt the script, they will never deface the inscriptions on temples and stones. They will instantly become the ambassadors of preserving ancient Tamil inscriptions,” Mr. Ramasubramanian says.

A group of 50 students and teachers have already brought out a book of Thirukkural couplets written in Tamizhi script. It has been decided to circulate it to all students of the group, and Tamil scholars across the State. In addition, the school authorities have decided to have classics such as Natrinai, Kurunthogai, Pathittrupathu, Purananooru and Mullaipattu written in Tamizhi script by their staff and students.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/99nfl5/article30672891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28JANTH-Tamizhijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/befriending-tamil-through-brahmi/article30672892.ece
202,2020/01/28,Five killed in road accident at Rajapalayam,"Five persons were killed in a road accident involving a car and a van at Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district early on Tuesday.

The police said the deceased were tourists from Sivakasi who were returning home in the car after visiting Courtallam.

The accident took place at curve on the Tenkasi-Rajapalayam Road around 12.45 a.m., police said.

They were identified as M. Muthukumar, 27, B. Ayyappan 33, A. Anthonyraj 30, S. Sudalaimani 30 and N. Prabhu 29.

While Prabhu succumbed to head injuries after being referred to the Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, others died on the spot.

Initial probe suggested that rash driving by the driver of the van, carrying some 17 persons, led to the accident, Rajapalayam Deputy Superintendent of Police, M. Nagasankar, said.

Eight persons, including three women travelling in the van, were injured. They were admitted to the Government Hospital in Rajapalayam.

203,2020/01/28,"Two killed, seven injured in group clash in Theni district","Two persons were killed and seven injured in a clash between two intermediate caste groups at Kailasapatti village, near Periyakulam, in Theni district on Monday.

Sources said that enmity had been simmering between the two groups over various issues in the village.

Earlier, one of the groups had lodged a complaint with the police against Jeyabal, 55, alleging that he was engaged in the sale of marijuana. Enraged by this, Jeyabal’s supporters allegedly damaged the houses of the individuals who had lodged the complaint.

On Monday morning, the individuals whose houses were attacked lodged a fresh complaint with the DSP of Periyakulam sub-division, claiming their lives were under threat. In the evening, the two groups got embroiled in a wordy quarrel, which escalated into a clash. Two persons died and seven sustained injuries as the belligerents attacked each other with stones and billhooks. Jeyabal, who suffered severe cuts, died at the Theni Government Hospital, where the injured were taken.

Perumal, 70, belonging to the rival group, is suspected to have died in a stone-throwing incident.

Relatives of the deceased blocked the Theni-Dindigul highway and assembled outside the hospital, demanding police action. Theni Superintendent of Police Sai Charan Tejaswi held talks with the agitators.

204,2020/01/28,Police encourage liquor brewers to embrace alternative trades,"“It was like a dream that I would rather forget. I did that for the sake of my family and I have decided to give up that trade for the sake of my children, who have grown up to school-final level,” says 43-year old G. Viswanathan of Paradharami, who wants to quit liquor brewing.

He wants to take up cattle rearing and has no clue how to go about it given the limited access he has to officials due to the trade he pursued all these years. But he is bent on leading a peaceful and respectable life for the sake of his family.

The Ranipet district police organised a meeting at Sambasivapuram in Arcot taluk on Monday to rehabilitate liquor brewers like Viswanathan and provide them with alternative livelihood options.

More than 1,000 families were residing in villages around Sambasivapuram and many families were engaged in brewing illicit liquor across several forest and hilly areas.

In the past six months, several raids were conducted across Ranipet district, and illicit liquor trade cases have been registered against 30 persons. Similar seizures, demolition of dens and arrests of hundreds of people were also recorded in the district, when it was with Vellore district. These raids and their aftermath highlighted the seriousness of the problem and the impact it had on underprivileged families.

Superintendent of Police, Ranipet, A. Myilvaganan said: “Brewing of illicit liquor is a severe problem in the district, prevalent mostly in areas surrounding the hills. It has adverse health impact on women and children. There have been instances where we have come across underprivileged people spending their entire earning on hooch and even found women, youths and children getting addicted to country liquor and spoiling their future.""

“In a recent raid held early this month, 115 police personnel conducted massive search operations in these regions and destroyed thousands of litres of fermented wash and other apparatus used for brewing liquor. More than 12 persons have been booked and imprisoned as per court order. Recently (Bun) Kumar, a notorious gangster involved in illicit liquor trade surrendered claiming that he wants to give up this trade,” said Mr. Myilvaganan.

A few families also expressed their wish to give up liquor brewing provided they were shown other avenues of income generation. A total of 52 persons, 40 from Sambasivapuram, five from Thimiri, two from Kavanur, one each from Paradharami, Karungalikuppam, Makkankudisai, Venkatapuram and Thanakulam have agreed to give up the liquor trade.

Mr. Myilvaganan said still 12 persons involved in this trade are eluding arrest. “When they surrender we will make sure they get minimum punishment and ensure measures to rehabilitate them through concerted efforts. Creating awareness about the ill effects of spurious liquor will be an integral part of this meeting. Youth should give up this, educate themselves and others on the ill-effects of the trade to erase the black mark on their villages. By doing so they can turn their tables by creating Green Lable, which is sure to make the country proud of them,"" he said.

A committee comprising youth as well as elders from the village, a village administrative officer, and the respective police inspector would be accountable to the District Police on illicit brewing of liquor or liquor trade in the villages. These committees can be approached for accessing welfare schemes through proper channels, Mr. Myilvaganan concluded.

“The meeting is aimed at reaching out to these people, to educate them about alternative employment opportunities and also brief them on the availability of various government schemes, including loans, to help them set up their own business,” said Ranipet DSP R. Geetha.

Bankers, heads of various departments presented a brief note on various employment opportunities, government schemes and loans available to set up business ventures to enhance their livelihood.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/c0zddq/article30670307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THSPRANIPET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/police-encourage-liquor-brewers-to-embrace-alternative-trades/article30670308.ece
205,2020/01/28,Experts offer insight into rights of prisoners,"Though the prisoners do not have full constitutional rights, they are protected by the 8th amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments at the hands of law enforcing officials, said N. Kamini, Deputy Inspector General of Police - Vellore range.

She was addressing the participants at the inauguration of three-day course on ‘Prisoners rights and entitlement laws, policies and apparatus-National and International perspective’ organised by Academy of Prisons and Correctional Administration in Vellore on Monday. The course was sponsored by Bureau of Police Research and Development, New Delhi and is aimed at providing an update on the subject through guest lectures, orientation programmes and interactive sessions.

In her address, Ms. Kamini explained the need and importance of protecting the rights of inmates who are under the custody of the State. She said that International Human Rights Laws protect people from discrimination and torture. “It also recognises the rights of specific groups of people, including women, children and people with disability, indigenous people and migrant workers. Some of these treaties are complemented by optional protocols that deal with specific issues or allow people to make complaints,” she said.

“The basic principles for the treatment of prisoners adopted and proclaimed by General Assembly Resolution 45/111 of December 14, 1990, is also remembered as Nelson Mandela Rules for the treatment of prisoners known worldwide,” she said. She added that the Supreme Court of India has said that the rights guaranteed by Article 21 are for every person and not even the State could deny that.

“Prisoners also have all the rights which a free man has under some circumstances and just being in prison does not deprive them of their fundamental rights,” she said. Director of APCA M.

206,2020/01/28,"Despite court ruling, officials refuse to register transwoman’s marriage","Despite a 2019 court ruling that validated marriages between a transwoman and a heterosexual man, the Sub-Registrar’s Office at Vadavalli in Coimbatore has rejected the marriage registration of a couple from Narasimhanaickenpalayam, forcing them to approach the District Registrar’s Office.

S. Sureka, a 24-year-old transwoman and R. Manikandan, a 25-year-old auto rickshaw driver had applied online to register their marriage on January 22. However, the Vadavalli Sub-Registrar’s Office rejected the application, citing the Hindu Marriage Act. “The word Bride as found in Section 5(iii) [of the Hindu Marriage Act] literally means as woman who has just married or is going to be married. The word Transgender finds no place in the Act [sic],” the reply from the Vadavalli Sub-Registrar’s Office said.

Ms. Sureka claimed the couple had attached all the required documents with the application. Mr. Manikandan said the marriage has taken place on February 14, 2018, at a temple in Kavundampalayam and added that the couple have been attempting to register their marriage ever since. “There was no response [from District Registrar Office] so far,” he said.

Software hitch

P.P. Sivkumar, the couple’s lawyer, who accompanied them on Monday to submit the petition, pointed out that despite the court order, the computer software used for registration at Sub-Registrar Offices recognises only ‘male’ and ‘female’ categories and not ‘transgender’. The solution to this issue would be the State government issuing a government order (G.O.) legalising marriages of transwomen to men, he said.

Mr. Sivkumar noted the verdict of the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court in April 2019, which said that a marriage between a transwoman and a male is valid under the Hindu Marriages Act.

An official from the Vadavalli Sub-Registrar Office told The Hindu that they have “clearly stated” the reasons for rejecting the marriage registration in their reply to the couple. “If they have any doubts regarding this order, they can only file an appeal at the District Registar Office,” the official said.

Transgender activist Kalki Subramaniam described this incident as “very contemptible” and said it displays the “ignorance” of officials. “For trans-people, creating a family is a big challenge,” she said. S. Delfina of NGO Nirangal Charitable Trust that works for the welfare of sexual minorities, said any transperson “who self-identifies as a woman” has the right to marry a male and the marriage will be valid, according to the 2019 verdict.

Officials at the District Registrar Office said suitable action will be taken on the petition, refusing to comment further.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/despite-court-ruling-officials-refuse-to-register-transwomans-marriage/article30670135.ece
207,2020/01/28,"‘Govt. trying to find new enemies every day, othering dissenters’","“The combination of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens is designed to deprive Muslims of equal rights under Indian law and in Indian society. Using the CAA as a tool of divisiveness against people of certain religions is against the reality of India and stands on legally unstable ground,” said Justice A.P. Shah (Retd.), former Chief Justice of the Madras and Delhi High Courts.

Justice Shah said the government was using the tool of ‘othering’, labelling dissenters as anti-national, anti-Hindu or anti-democratic. “But the enemy is something that exists only in their heads,” he said at a public discussion on CAA-NRC-NPR at the Music Academy on Monday.

“They are searching for new enemies every day. The leadership forgets its duty is to govern rather than be an agency whose role is to gather and pander to vote banks and indulge in identity-based politicking,” he said.

Justice Shah said the CAA was morally reprehensive, plainly unconstitutional and violated the fundamental right to equality before the law, under Article 14 of the Constitution.

“The Constitutional protection requires that any kind of State classification of persons must be reasonable and must have a rational and just object. But the CAA introduces a classification without any reasonable basis. Restricting the definition of persecuted minorities to non-Muslims is irrational,” he said.

Justice Shah said that despite the attempts being made to divide and rule, the people, especially the youth, had risen up in an unprecedented collective movement to protest against this. “Students in particular are the torch-bearers of Constitutional principles,” he said.

‘Illegal exercise’

Usha Ramanathan, a legal scholar, noted that the government had claimed that there was no connection between the NPR and the NRC, and that the NPR will not lead to the NRC. “If that is true, then the NPR is an illegal exercise. There is no law other than the Citizenship Act that allows for an NPR or for collection of this data. So if it is not under the Citizenship Act, this exercise cannot be allowed to carry on,” she said.

Ms. Usha said Aadhaar was at the centre of the NPR exercise. Since the UID (the Aadhaar project) began, the citizens were being told that they belonged to the State, along with their data and the biometrics, she said, adding, “We don’t belong to the State. The State owes us an obligation, responsibility. We don’t owe the State that.”

She said when the government claims that people don’t have to submit every document for the NPR exercise, they will decide whose documents to verify. “It’s an executive exercise. Even in Assam, there were people who produced documents, and they (government) said they won’t accept it,” she said.

Describing the protests against the CAA as a peaceful mass revolt, N. Ram, Chairman, THG Publishing Pvt. Ltd., said, “I don't think we need to exaggerate this movement against this unjust and indeed outrageous piece of legislation. There is no question that the students have come to the fore in this movement.”

Mr. Ram said the CAA-NPR-NRC signified the BJP’s Hindutva agenda which directly challenged the principles of secularism. “We haven't quite put a finger on what prompted the people (those protesting against the CAA) to move...the first time, there's a direct challenge to government that is not only communal, but also authoritarian,” he said.

Journalist Rohini Mohan presented her field work on the NRC process that was undertaken in Assam, and explained how it disenfranchised a large number of people.

208,2020/01/28,"CM, Panneerselvamhold marathon meetings with Ministers","Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam held meetings with Ministers at the Secretariat on Monday.

The two, who jointly head the AIADMK, conducted a group meeting with Cabinet colleagues, followed by consultations with each other, and then held discussions with individual Ministers.

The over four-hour-long meetings with Ministers lasted till about 9 p.m., multiple sources confirmed.

Issues ranging from departmental subjects to the AIADMK’s performance in the recently-concluded rural local body elections were discussed.

Range of issues

“Ministers were asked about the performance in their respective districts and departments. Intra-party issues, if any, in the Ministers’ districts were also discussed,” sources said.

Although the AIADMK’s alliance with the BJP was said to have been discussed with a few Ministers, some claimed the discussion was restricted to Ministers known to voice their opinions in public fora.

In districts where the AIADMK’s performance had been either marginal or poor, the Chief Minister and the Deputy CM sought to know from the Ministers the changes that could be effected, sources said.

“In some districts, there were some intra-party misunderstandings and doubts, which the Ministers explained. The CM and Deputy CM patiently listened to them,” said a source.

Assumes significance

Except for some senior Ministers, considered to be part of the inner circle, all other Ministers had meetings with the AIADMK coordinator and co-coordinator.

Besides party affairs, department-specific issues like funding and the implementation of government schemes in various districts were discussed. The meetings with Ministers are considered important, as these are the first such meetings since the rural local body polls were held and the party issued a gag order on alliance matters.

209,2020/01/28,Medaram spruced up for Sammakka-Sarakka Jatara,"The district administration has made elaborate arrangements for the lakhs of devotees expected at the biennial Sammakka-Sarakka Jatara at Medaram this year, said V. Chakradhara Rao, project officer, Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Eturunagaram.

To make it a plastic-free affair, 10 check posts have been set up to seize plastic carry bags from devotees. Bus drivers and conductors have also been instructed to discourage passengers from carrying plastic bags. “We have arranged for free distribution of 35,000 cloth bags sponsored by Vijaya Dairy and 10,000 cloth bags by Nandyala Pipes and several other NGOs,” Mr Rao said.

Fifty women volunteers from Jeevanadhi NGO would be on duty at Jampanna vagu and other places to pick up plastic waste and dump them in dustbins. The ITDA has let out free spaces to shops selling jute bags all over Medaram village as part of its plastic-free drive.

“This time, we are also adding more facilities. We are setting up five huge sheds, each of which can accommodate 1,000 devotees to rest briefly before and after darshan. Earlier, they were left to fend for themselves by braving the chill or raising temporary tents of plastic sheets,” he explained.

The district administration has provided 342 pipelines, each containing 20 taps for bathing at Jampanna vagu and 538 pipelines, also attached with 20 taps each for drinking water purposes, all over Medaram village. A total of 8,400 toilets have been constructed in the 2-km radius of the altar.

The ITDA project officer added that 129 four-arm solar lights and 100 single-arm solar lights have been installed to cover 25 km around the village on permanent basis with an estimated cost of ₹2 crore.

Besides, the tribal museum at Medaram has also been renovated and it would be thrown open to the public to view tribal dances and other performances daily for entertainment as well as education purposes.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/y1vi3p/article30677784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28-MEDARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/medaram-spruced-up-for-sammakka-sarakka-jatara/article30677773.ece
210,2020/01/28,The ongoing quest for equality,"With the objective to show that Sanatana Dharma treated everyone as equal before God, Sri Nrusimha Vahini, a social service organisation, and the Temples Protection Movement (TPM) are planning to conduct ‘Munivahana Utsavam’ in Bhadrachalam on February 11.

Announcing this at a press conference here on Tuesday, Chilkur Balaji temple chief priest C.S. Rangarajan from Hyderabad and Krishna Chaitanya of Sri Nrusimha Vahini highlighted the significance of the ‘Munivahana Utsavam’.

Mr Rangarajan arrived in the temple town to participate in the five-day Bhakta Ramadasu jayanti celebrations beginning on Wednesday.

Earlier in the day, he attended a ceremony held in connection with offering of a book titled ‘Bhadrachala Panchashat’ containing 50 slokas in Sanskrit, written by Srinidhi Swamy, at the feet of the presiding deity of the historic Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple.

Addressing mediapersons, Mr Rangarajan explained the history of the Munivahana Utsavam. It was nearly 2,700 years ago that Tiruppanalwar, born into a ‘lower caste’, was carried from the banks of the river Cauvery into the Srirangam Ranganatha Swamy temple by a priest, which was hailed then as Munivahana Utsavam, he noted.

In the present circumstances when discrimination in the name of caste and class is rampant, the same scene was enacted recently in Hyderabad, he said. Narrating his own experience of carrying a Dalit devotee into the Ranganatha Swamy temple in Jiyaguda, he said he considered the devotee as the holy Tiruppanalwar himself. It coincided with the millennial celebrations of appearance of Sri Bhagawad Ramanuja, who had fought for a casteless and egalitarian society, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/the-ongoing-quest-for-equality/article30677759.ece

212,2020/01/28,IIT-H team develops new drug delivery system to treat fungal infections,"Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology-Hyderabad (IIT-H) have developed essential oil-based drug delivery systems to treat fungal infections without the risk of inducing drug resistance. This medication can even counter fungi that have developed resistance to conventional antifungal drugs.

The research was led by Mudrika Khandelwal, associate professor, Department of Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering, and supported by funds from the Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science and Technology (DST) and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) grants from the American multinational conglomerate AT&T.

The research paper, co-authored with her Ph.D student Shivakalyani Adepu, was published in the international peer-reviewed journal, Materialia.

With the results of this work, the researchers are developing prototype antifungal hygiene products with financial support from the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC), set up by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), as an interface agency to strengthen and empower emerging biotech enterprises.

“Given the prevalence of fungal infections such as vaginal infections, diaper rash, athlete’s foot and nail fungus, caused by the Candida family of fungi, drug resistance can become life-threatening,” said Ms. Khandelwal.

“Herbal essential oils and their ingredients are a promising class of effective antimicrobials. Thymol found in oregano oils, carvacrol found in thyme and eugenol found in clove oil have excellent antimicrobial action against all types of Candida fungi. The problem with essential oils and their components is that they are sensitive to temperature, light, and pH and decompose easily,” said Ms. Adepu.

Currently, the researchers are developing antifungal panty liners for mitigating vaginal candidiasis. “The developed formulation can also be used as a transdermal patch/ mucoadhesive patch to treat skin and mucocutaneous infections without inducing resistance in the fungal species,” added Ms. Khandelwal.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/s0bbfu/article30677121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28-IITH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/iit-h-team-develops-new-drug-delivery-system-to-treat-fungal-infections/article30677122.ece
213,2020/01/28,TRS misused power to win civic chief’s posts: BJP,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit president K. Laxman has accused Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his son K.T. Rama Rao of making a mockery of democracy by resorting to “unethical and undemocratic” means to grab the posts of municipal corporation mayors and deputy mayors and municipal chairpersons and vice-chairpersons.

The ruling party leaders had adopted undemocratic and unconstitutional methods to win the elections to the posts of civic bodies’ chiefs even where BJP had secured majority seats (wards), he said while addressing a press conference here on Tuesday. Terming Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao and Mr. Rama Rao as “political opportunists”, the BJP leader alleged that TRS had indulged in all sorts of undemocratic means including violation of elections norms, distribution of money to lure voters and misuse of official machinery.

The BJP had not only fought elections politically against TRS, Congress and MIM, but also faced irregularities of the Opposition parties, particularly of the TRS. Stating that performance of BJP in the municipal elections was very encouraging, Mr. Laxman said the party could increase its seat tally and vote percentage across the State. He thanked people for supporting BJP candidates in spite of all kinds of tactics employed by TRS.

Backdoor win

Referring to Nizamabad Municipal Corporation elections, he said the ruling TRS had bagged the mayor post with the support of MIM although BJP was the largest single party by winning 28 out of 60 seats (wards). Similarly, TRS stood third by winning five out of 15 seats in Tukkuguda municipality but grabbed the chairperson’s post through backdoor, though BJP won 9 seats, Mr. Laxman pointed out.

Citing another example of the irregularities committed by the TRS, the BJP leader stated that till the end of elections process Rajya Sabha member K. Keshava Rao’s name as an ex-officio member was listed in Badangpet municipality, but in the last minutes the officials, under the pressure from the ruling party, allotted him to to Tukkuguda. He sought to know, how Mr. Keshava Rao allotted to Andhra Pradesh during bifurcation of combined Andhra Pradesh vote as an ex-officio member in Telangana.

“We have already lodged a complaint with the State Election Commission in the matter and the party would also lodge a complaint with the President and Raya Sabha Chairman,” Mr. Laxman stated.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/z8ym8k/article30680931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29KLAXMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-misused-power-to-win-civic-chiefs-posts-bjp/article30676939.ece
214,2020/01/28,Anjanagiri Reservoir to be first with GW bund,"When completed, Anjanagiri Reservoir of the Palamuru-Rangareddy project would become, according to engineers, the first water storage facility in the country to have been constructed with a technology that is not tried and tested here.

The reservoir’s earthen bund is being formed with well-graded gravel (GW) instead of the regular well-graded silty clayey gravel (GWC) due to non-availability of suitable casing soils in the vicinity, Executive Engineer (Div. I) of the project K. Vijay Kumar said. “The nearest point where the suitable soils are available is about 25 km to 28 km away and transporting over 100 crore cubic meters of soil from such a distance is not only a costly affair but filled with other challenges too since the vehicles carrying the material would have to cross four villages to reach the reservoir site,” he explained.

The project engineers were left with no choice but to look for alternative material as they have identified the problem during the planning stage itself. “As per the American Civil Engineering Code use of GW soils is allowed, although it has not been used so far in India,” he noted.

Concrete bunds

The options of cement-concrete and rock-fill bunds were ruled out as constructing about 6.5 km length of bund with such material would have jacked up the reservoir cost very high. Besides, transporting such huge quantity of soil would have taken at least two years at the rate of 100 dumper-trips everyday with required trips estimated to be about 6.67 lakh.

However, they had to get the available GW soil, excavated from the reservoir bed by using controlled blasting, tested for its strength when used for construction of a major reservoir bund. Accordingly, they approached the Central Soil and Materials Research Station (CSMRS) in New Delhi and the material was cleared for use. Later, the technology was also vetted by the experts from Tehri dam in Uttarakhand.

No seepage

“Use of the material has already proven its strength as there has been no damage to the bund during the rainy season and there’s no seepage of water too since four-five meters deep rainwater is already logged towards the major portion of the bund,” site engineers and work agency engineers stated.

During a visit to the project works recently, Mr. Vijay Kumar told The Hindu that a level (design) flaw was also detected in time, before the commencement of works, wherein it was noticed that there was a variation of 10 metres to 12 meters in the alignment starting with Anjanagiri reservoir after a 10-metre contour was overlooked by mistake in the toposheets. “Had the mistake been not noticed, alignment of all structures in the project would have gone wrong and failed to serve the desired purpose,” he stated.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2ifxfs/article30676876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29ANJANAGIRIRESERVOIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/anjanagiri-reservoir-to-be-first-with-gw-bund/article30676877.ece
215,2020/01/28,"Municipal election process an insult to Telangana, says Uttam","Alleging misuse of power and adoption of “illegal and unethical” means by the ruling party to win the municipal polls, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy said the results could not be called as people’s mandate.

At a press conference here, he said the process of elections right from issuing notification to election of chairpersons was nothing but an insult to Telangana society. He alleged that TRS working president K. T. Rama Rao was directly controlling the officials in the election process.

He also alleged that State Election Commissioner (SEC) Nagi Reddy and Director Municipal Administration T. Sreedevi also functioned under the influence of KTR.

Giving the example Nereducherla Municipality in Suryapet district, he said the election was postponed on trivial reasons and officials were unavailable for the whole day. Congress had 8 seats while TRS had only 7 seats, and yet they got TRS candidate elected as the chairperson. Officials changed the voters list to include the name of TRS MLC Seri Shubash Reddy on January 28 when the deadline for nomination was January 25 itself.

The officials also created problems for Rajya Sabha MP from Telangana KVP Ramachandra Rao removing his name from the list only to add it after Congress strongly protested.

Mr. Ramchandra Rao, who was present at the press conference, said he was allotted to Telangana after State bifurcation and moreover, he was a voter in Hyderabad since 1980. “How can they deny my vote when the Rajya Sabha itself clarified that I represent Telangana.” He also furnished the Rajya Sabha document showing him as representing Telangana.

Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said Nereducherla municipal election symbolises the manner in which municipal elections were held in Telangana. He said instead of mocking the election process, TRS party should have prepared the lists of municipalities at KCR’s farm house and announced its victory.

Congress MLC T. Jeevan Reddy also questioned as to how TRS Member of Parliament K. Keshav Rao was allowed to vote in Tukkuguda when he represented Andhra Pradesh in Parliament. If he was allowed on the ground that he resides in Hyderabad how come Congress MP K.M. Khan, was disallowed when he enrolled as ex-officio member from Narayankhed municipality. Mr. Khan, who is a resident of Hyderabad, too was allotted Andhra Pradesh after bifurcation just like Mr. Keshav Rao, he pointed out.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/8hvous/article30677026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy28Uttam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/municipal-election-process-an-insult-to-telangana-says-uttam/article30676817.ece
216,2020/01/28,Central team reviews steps taken to control Coronavirus,"The three-member multidisciplinary Central team, which reviewed measures taken for management and control of novel Coronavirus (nCoV) at Fever Hospital here on Tuesday, gave a few suggestions on how to handle personal protection equipment (PPE), disinfecting vehicles which carry samples collected from suspected cases and other details.

They visited the Isolation Ward and Virology lab at Sir Ronald Ross Institute for Tropical and Communicable Diseases, also known an Fever Hospital, where they asked the staff how they use and dispose masks, and other aspects.

The team consisted of Dr Anitha Varma, Epidemiologist, Prof. Ajay Chauhan, Respiratory Medicine, and Dr Shubha Garg, a Microbiologist from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). Senior Regional Director, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Anuradha Medoju and superintendent of Fever Hospital Dr K Shankar accompanied them during the review.

Prior to their visit, they held meetings with Special Chief Secretary of Telangana Health and Family Welfare department A Santhi Kumari, Director of Medical Education Dr K Ramesh Reddy and other officials.

Dr Shankar said the Central team gave some suggestions which will be taken to the notice of higher officials. He said that, apart from 40 beds in Isolation Ward at the hospital, there were 40 more beds in the Isolation Ward of Gandhi Hospital, and 20 more at the Government General and Chest Hospital.

“If anyone suspects to have nCoV symptoms, or if someone with travel history to China wants to get admitted fearing they contracted the virus, they will be admitted at the Fever Hospital’s Isolation Ward. If the in-patients develop any respiratory problems, they will be taken to Gandhi Hospital where ventilator support will be provided as there are no ventilators at Fever Hospital, ” officials said

Dr Medoju said that they are currently screening passengers from Hong Kong at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), Shamshabad. If passengers coming in more flights were to be screened, they might need more work force, including doctors, she said.

Collector P. Venkatarami Reddy along with Gajwel Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) D Vijayender Reddy and others visited Tunki Bollaram two days ago and examined the ongoing works. He has also instructed the constructing agencies to complete the infrastructure works at the earliest.

Mamidyala is one of the villages that would be submerged due to the Kondapochamma reservoir coming up in Gajwel constituency being represented by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Construction of the reservoir was almost complete and only a small passage was left to allow traffic to villages where the oustees are currently residing.

Three villages and one tanda - Bahilampur, Mamidyala, Thanedarpally and Thanedarpally – will be submerged under the project. Houses are being constructed for the oustees at Tunki Bollaram Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) conloy in Mulugu mandal. About 600 houses were already completed in first phase followed by another 117 houses in the second phase. Houses were completed to slab level 400 in numbers and the construction will be completed in few months.

Oustees of Thanedarpally tanda were allotted houses first in Tunki Bollaram followed by Thanedarpally. Keys were handed over to about 204 families from the tanda and village. About 15 families from tanda had already started living. Some other oustees of Thanedarpally village started constructing compound wall for their new houses.

The officials have already identified 480 eligible families from Mamidyala who would be handed over keys for the new houses.

In a move to give assurance to the oustees, the Collector has also organsied a job mela at the colony and some of them were selected. They were instructed to get ready for training programme from January 30.

220,2020/01/28,TRS political camp before MCK Mayor election,"As the TRS high command is in the process of selecting candidates for the posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor of the Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar (MCK), the party district leadership had organised a political camp with all the elected TRS corporators in Karimnagar district from Monday night onwards.

After the completion of counting and declaration of results of MCK polls, the TRS, which had won 33 divisions out of a total of 60 that made its way clear for the election of Mayor and Deputy Mayor without the support of any political party or Independents, had organised the political camp. Accordingly, the TRS corporators were bundled into a special bus to a secret place in Hyderabad on Monday night.

Incidentally, Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar had made arrangements for the political camp. However, this decision of a camp by TRS corporators when there was no chance of horse trading or poaching by other parties, is raising eyebrows.

Political camps should be organised only when there was a hung verdict and when other parties are also planning to occupy the coveted Mayor post, the party sources said, and added that TRS had secured an absolute majority of 33 divisions to grab both posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor without the support of any other party. The BJP, which secured 13 divisions, MIM with six divisions and eight Independents have no plans of involving in horse trading to occupy the coveted posts, they maintained.

Some of the senior TRS leaders observed that the political camp was organised with the TRS corporators only to ensure that they abide by the party high command decision on the candidature. “By organising the camp, we can brief the corporators about the importance of voting in favour of the candidates preferred by the high command for the Mayor and Deputy Mayor posts”, they said.

“If we don’t organise the camp, the corporators will definitely have an inclination towards the candidature of someone else and may not like the candidature of the high command. But, by organising the camp, we will not give any iota of doubt to the corporators and we will ensure that the Mayor and Deputy Mayor elections are unanimous as they would be brought directly to the municipal office for the special session on Wednesday, they clarified.

The strategy to be adopted by the party was decided at the Parliamentary Party meeting at Telangana Bhavan, headed by TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao.

The TRS MPs will express their opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Registry of Citizens (NRC) and advise the government to focus on improving the economy and addressing unemployment rather than issues like the CAA and the NRC.

KTR advised them to raise the economic crisis in the country and how it was impacting even a progressive state like Telangana. He said the MPs should not hesitate in blaming the Centre for not releasing the GST dues and demand immediate release of funds. The Centre would also be exposed on how it ignored NITI Aayog suggestions on financial assistance to innovative programmes in Telangana.

The floor would also be used to highlight the schemes in Telangana like Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima, Mission Kakatiya, Aarogyasri and Harithahaaram and how the Central government was inspired by them. Yet the Centre was not giving any funds to Telangana.

224,2020/01/28,"Congress loses Karimnagar municipality, its old citadel","Ever since its formation, the Karimnagar municipality had emerged as a bastion of the Congress, which continued its sway in all the elections till its upgradation into a municipal corporation by winning the first Mayoral poll.

After the formation of Telangana State, Congress had lost its sheen in the municipal elections in Karimnagar. In the 2014 elections, it was confined to only 13 municipal divisions against a total of 50 losing power to the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS). Later, all its corporators, barring two, had shifted their loyalties to the TRS.

Leadership failure

The resignation of Town president Karra Rajashekhar and DCC president K. Mruthyunjayam along with party corporators had come as a rude shock to the Congress, especially on the eve of the municipal elections. At this juncture, TPCC working president Ponnam Prabhakar took charge and tried hard to field candidates from at least 53 divisions against a total of 60.

However, the party had received a severe blow as it had been completely wiped out of the municipal corporation, as not a single corporator had won from any division in the town.

To exacerbate, most of the Congress candidates from various divisions polled single digit votes. To top it, the party’s Mayor candidate Pyata Ramesh had lost the deposit.

Worse than Independents

The party was hopeful of at least securing double digit results. But it had lost even its two sitting corporators and failed to open an account in any part of the town. Its candidates’ performance was so bad that they secured lesser votes than the Independents.

Non-availability of strong district leadership and inability to cash in on the anti-incumbency factor of the TRS government had proved costly for the party in the elections, said a senior Congress leader. “The party had literally failed on the campaigning front as it was a low-key affair, and it had not highlighted the failures of the TRS regime in the municipal corporation,” he stated.

He also said that bifurcation of integrated Karimnagar into seven districts too had an impact on the party leadership with the segregation of senior leaders. “The formation of new districts had affected the unity of the Congress,” he complained.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pn6uyx/article30678195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-KRM-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-loses-karimnagar-municipality-its-old-citadel/article30675933.ece
225,2020/01/28,‘Follow traffic rules to prevent accidents’,"Road Safety commissioner Sandeep Sandilya stressed on the need to prevent road accidents by following safety norms and being alert while driving.

Participating as the chief guest at a programme marking the 31st Road Safety Week at Regional Transport Office at Thimmapur on the outskirts of Karimnagar town on Tuesday, he said that road accidents could be prevented if traffic rules and regulations were followed properly.

Stating that a cricketer wears helmet for protection while facing a ball weighing 250 grams, he expressed concern over the youth nowadays not wearing helmets while driving 250 kg bikes.

He added that majority of deaths caused by road accidents were because of people not wearing helmets. “Drunk driving is another cause,” he said. He urged all sections of the society to follow traffic rules.

Transport Commissioner Sandeep Kumar Sultania said that over-speeding was also another reason for road accidents. .

Collector K. Shashanka called upon people to drive safely and remember that their family members were waiting for their safe return.

Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy said that they were cancelling the driving licence of people caught driving drunk. Deputy transport commissioners Srinivas and Papa Rao, RDO Praveenya and others were present.

226,2020/01/28,TRS wins Nereducherla tied contest fielding new voter in the endgame,"The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) won the hotly-contested, and hung Nereducherla Municipality by one vote, after it sprang a surprise by producing a new ex-officio member at the last minute, on Tuesday.

MLC Seri Subhash Reddy, the surprise addition, arrived along with MLA Shanampudi Saidi Reddy, MP Badugula Lingaiah Yadav and MLC B. Venkateswarlu as TRS’ ex-officio members, taking its vote count to 11, including the seven councillors. The Congress’ strength remained 10 with eight councillors, including one belonging to CPI (M), and MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and MP K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao as the ex-officio members.

Apart from transfering District Collector D. Amoy Kumar on Monday night, Nereducherla Municipal Commissioner P. Mahender Reddy was also placed under suspension, and in-charge Tahsildar Ram Reddy was appointed in the position.

Heavy police cordon

By 10 a.m. Nereducherla town resembled a garrison with some 500 police personnel and special parties marching and cordoning off the Municipal Office. All shops and institutions were also shut following imposition of Section 144.

Till morning the result was expected to be by drawing of lots as both sides were tied 10-10. However, the new list suspended all possibilities, and the victory was on the TRS side even before the election. The TRS batch of leaders were the first to occupy their seats followed by the Congress. Soon, the ‘Congress 10’ exited the office expressing no interest to participate in the election. TRS leaders, who in all were 11 in number, voted Chandamalla Jayababu of Ward 7 as Chairman and Challa Srilatha of Ward 13 as Vice-Chairperson.

Congress protest

The aggrieved Congress leaders staged a sit-in on the road, alleging the election illegal and the election machinery was hand in glove with the TRS. “How can the voter list be changed after the election process began with the councillors completing their oath on Monday? It was the TRS members who created a ruckus, called for quorum, and they came with a new list today,” Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said.

He also said that the SEC had assured Congress that the list finalized by it on January 25, which allows Mr. Ramachandra Rao as an ex-officio, would be the final one, and alleged that TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao had influenced the SEC.

Political ping pong

TRS leaders, speaking to media after the election, said nothing could be done about the charges levelled by the Congress and that they were free to go to court. “Like they brought KVP from Andhra into the list after the councillors’ oath, we brought Subhash Reddy today. This is politics and elections. Uttam is just acting out of frustration,” TRS Member of Parliament Yadav and MLC Venkateswarlu said.

The Congress leaders, who were protesting on the road, were taken away by the police.

227,2020/01/28,Vemulawada temple overflows with devotees ahead of Medaram Jatara,"The Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam in Vemulawada was packed to the brim with the arrival of hundreds of pilgrims from various parts of the State on Monday.

It is a ritual for those headed to the biennial Samakka-Sarakka Jatara at Medaram (February 5 to 8) to first offer prayers at the Vemulawada temple. Devotees took holy dip in the dharmagundam’ and participated in the ‘kode mokku’ (tying of an ox) ritual and offering ‘bonalu’ at Baddi Pochamma temple in the temple town for smooth passage of the pilgrimage in Medaram.

However, with the unprecedented congregation, sanitation went for a toss and other arrangements such as drinking water in the temple queues was affected. Pilgrims occupied every inch in open places of the temple town due to non-availability of accommodation. Traffic, too, came to a standstill despite heavy deployment of police force.

Incidentally, temple executive officer Krishnaveni is on long leave. Following his abscence, administrative work was hit with no authorities coming forward to chalk out strategies for providing adequate arrangements to devotees.

If unresolved, devotees could be put to serious inconvenience, considering that the rush to the shrine would only swell over the next days until the Medaram Jatara begins.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/i2ihnw/article30669443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY27-VEMULA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/vemulawada-temple-overflows-with-devotees-ahead-of-medaram-jatara/article30669434.ece
228,2020/01/28,Discontent within ruling party comes to the fore,"Elections to the municipal chairperson posts witnessed some tense moments in the undivided district with police resorting to mild lathicharge in at least two places.

At Bollaram, two groups of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) — one represented by K. Bal Reddy (nine wards) and another by Chandra Reddy (eight wards) — won 17 wards. However, the groups fought for the chairperson post. Here, Congress won two wards while BJP bagged three. During the chairperson elections, Congress and BJP extended support to Bal Reddy group, whose strength rose to 14, thereby providing them the opportunity to win the post and elect K. Roja Rani, wife of Mr. Bal Reddy. Vice-chairman post was given to Congress ward member A. Anil Reddy.

Tension prevailed for some time in the town and police were forced to lathicharge to control the agitating members of both groups. Superintendent of Police S. Chandrasekhar Reddy and DSP K. Sridhar Reddy were present throughout the day to ensure that no untoward incident takes place.

In case of Narayanakhed, TRS was able to win the municipality post with the support of Lok Sabha member B.B. Patil, MLA M. Bhupal Reddy and MLC Farooq Hussain, who cast their ex-officio vote.

At Cheriyal municipality, both Congress and TRS won five seats each while two independents were also elected. They extended support to TRS, paving the way for bagging the key post.

At Medak town, police had to use force to control the supporters of A. Mallikarjun Goud, who agitated for some time. Here, Mr. Goud expected the top post but TRS party leadership preferred T. Chandrapal. However, police controlled the agitators and saw that the election was held peacefully.

At Gajwel, 12th ward corporator V. Narayana Reddy resigned from the elected post and party primary membership protesting over selection of N. Rajamouli as chairman.

229,2020/01/28,Artist C Krishnaswamy uses art and performance to explore mythology and human existence,"Ashvita’s gallery space looks sparse. All shades of grey emanate from the space, lined by glass windows — save for a few structures made of steel, and minimalist canvases. The latter, make up a series titled Mutual Closeness, each portraying a lone ray of light or illumination, rendered in a linear way, against chaotic blue-black and brown-black backdrops.

Artist and performance artiste C Krishnaswamy’s work is predominantly a search: there are no right or wrong answers for him, each work is born out of intuition. Which is why abstraction is his strong point, as is seen in this display titled Primordial Universe — the steel structures (which remind me of stick figures), sporting various poses are unassuming and inspired by racks.

Life imitates...

Krishnaswamy’s lived experiences are what most often translate onto his canvas.

A performance artiste known for choosing unconventional spaces, his journeys with art and performance are mutually exclusive.

He hails from a village called Chinnasalem, where every two years, a temple festival is held, centred around The Mahabharata. People dress up as gods and goddesses to offer prayers. As a child, this ritual fascinated Krishnaswamy, and the possibilities of being one with an intangible concept stuck with him.

Mutual Closeness, one of the works | Photo Credit: special arrangement

Sanjana Srinivasan, curator of the show, says, “He has always had this tendency to become one with his work. This reflects in his performances as well.”

The artist humbly chimes in with a smile, “I believe in the form of disguise. I believe that everyone is in disguise; the true essence of one is not known.”

For instance, his performance Kundalini Rising portrays him practising yoga on a painted canvas, while another performance has him cooking rice for the souls of the deceased in a crematorium, and later smearing himself with it. The transience of a physical form is what Krishnaswamy explores through this. And while exploring this, his native experiences also surface. One of these is a penchant for mythology. He remembers, as a four-year-old, listening to the episode of the birth of Dharma, every night from 8 pm through midnight during the festival.

“Though his ideas are very contemporary, most of his paintings and sculptures have elements that go back to something very personal. And how he can translate that into his own language,” says Sanjana, adding that, for instance, the material used in the sculptures are a tribute to his family’s profession. (They are vessel merchants.)

“Whatever he wants to know, seems to evade him. Which is why he feels that everything is in disguise,” continues Sanjana. The artiste takes over. “Only the body is material, and we know that through age. Somehow, there is an intangible thought working at all times, within us,” he says.

His relationship with the practice of yoga is also part of this search. He believes that there are infinite layers within us. “Each and every day, I look at my own work and realise a different thing,” says Krishnaswamy.

Liberation is another aspect that he is trying to achieve through his work. Sanjana agrees, saying that Krishnaswamy dwells on his calling, till he is satisfied. Which is also why many of his performances go on for hours, regardless of people walking out or getting distracted midway. He sticks through until he knows he is done. This, is perhaps, liberation for him.

230,2020/01/28,NSCN widows’ body seeks settlement for lasting peace,"The tripartite Bodo accord signed on Monday has stimulated the demand for a solution to the protracted Naga political issue.

Hours after the signing of the accord among the Union government, the Assam government and the Assam-based factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) and the All Bodo Students’ Union, the Widows’ Federation of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN) wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a settlement for lasting peace.

“The Nagas in general and the widows of war, in particular, are in a positive frame of mind as we closely study the unfolding development with regard to the ongoing Indo-Naga political talks that are being guided and monitored by you,” the federation said in the letter.

“Our hearts have cried for the final solution because we have seen enough of fighting and killings” in the last 72 years of the Naga political struggle and 23 years of the talks with the NSCN-IM, it said.

“It is time to say enough is enough. No more fighting, no more killing and let there be no more widows and fatherless children... Let us admit ourselves that there is time for everything. There is time for war and there is time for peace and understanding,” the letter said.

The federation said that its members “would like to place ourselves in the comfort zone and look towards the days when we shall no more see the horror of war”. It also advised the government to arrive at a peaceful, acceptable solution to avoid “another conflict between the Nagas and India”.

Governor flayed

The Naga Intellectual Forum (NIF) has condemned Nagaland Governor R.N. Ravi’s statement on the eve of Republic Day. The speech, it said, was more of a threat to the Naga people than an appeal.

In his speech, Mr Ravi said two evils — gun and corruption – have taken an unacceptable toll on the people and assured to eliminate it to build a new Nagaland. He also reminded “some people”, who try to undermine the historical reality of the State and its unique constitutional status by using guns, that violence has never succeeded and shall never succeed, and the people are supreme in democratic India.

“We resolve our differences through peaceful dialogue, not under the shadow of guns. I remind those with guns that any attempt to subdue the people with fear is doomed to fail and bound to recoil. I urge them to read the bold writings on the wall – and reformat themselves in tune with the reality before it is too late,” he said.

The NIF said, “The incoherence is profound and therefore quite perplexing whether he is speaking as the Governor of Nagaland or as the Indian Interlocutor to the Indo-Naga peace talks even as it is unbecoming of any position either way. It is rather reflective of a diabolical modus operandi likely in the offing.”

The forum asserted that the “Nagas were never a part of India either by consent or by conquest and that Nagaland is just a part of its history created in 1963”. It also advised the Governor to ensure that the elected government of Nagaland acts constitutionally in the interest of people.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/frneq9/article30677588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TH-THGRP-BODO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nagas-seek-settlement-for-lasting-peace/article30677589.ece

232,2020/01/28,BJP government promoting violence in society: Rahul Gandhi,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused the BJP government at the Centre of promoting violence by raising divisive issues, which had set the citizens against each other and created an atmosphere of insecurity. Foreign investors were wondering if they should risk their money in India in such conditions, he said.

Addressing a “Yuva Aakrosh” (youth outrage) rally outside Albert Hall here, Mr. Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had destroyed India’s image as a peaceful country before the world. “People earlier identified Pakistan with an environment of violence and saw India as a country which took everyone along... Mr. Modi has tarnished this image of India,” he said.

‘Diversionary tactic’

He said the BJP government had brought the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to divert attention from the real issues. “Wherever the PM goes, he talks of CAA and NRC, but he does not speak a word on unemployment which is the biggest issue,” he said.

The rally was organised by the Youth Congress and the party’s student wing, National Students’ Union of India, to highlight the issues confronting the youth. Mr. Gandhi said the youth were the nation’s biggest asset, but the Centre’s policies had destroyed their potential and left them to struggle for livelihood.

He said while the unemployment rate had touched the highest figure in 45 years, the growth rate of 9% reached during the UPA regime had now declined to 5%. The current growth rate was only 2.5% if calculated with the old gross domestic product formula used in the UPA period, he said.

Mr. Gandhi launched the “National Register of Unemployed” (NRU) as an answer to the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) during the rally and unveiled its posters. The posters prepared by the Youth Congress carried slogans such as “I want a job, not rhetoric”, “I have a degree, but no job” and “Where is my job?.

Mr. Gandhi said one crore people had lost their jobs last year, while the government had promised to create 2 crore jobs every year when elected to power. “We have the best talent in the world, but it is being wasted,” he said while asking the youth to raise questions on unemployment.

Mr. Gandhi also criticised Mr. Modi on demonetisation and the goods and services tax, which he said had damaged the economy.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ebs4j9/article30675552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28YUVAAKROSHRALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/modi-government-destroyed-indias-image-deterred-investors-rahul-gandhi/article30675553.ece

234,2020/01/28,"Peace accord to fulfil aspirations of Bodos, non-Bodos: Himanta","The Bodo Peace Accord has fulfilled the aspirations of Bodos and non-Bodos living in the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) and reaffirmed the territorial integrity of Assam, State Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on January 28.

Earlier, when the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) was created with the signing of an accord in 2003, many non-Bodo villages had been included in it while several Bodo villages were left out of it. The accord signed on Monday will set it right, Mr. Sarma, also the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convenor, told reporters here.

“For the first time, non-Bodos have the option to move out of the council while Bodo villages outside the council can be included,” he said.

A commission, headed by a neutral person and represented by stakeholders, will be constituted by the central government for the demarcation and reorganisation of the BTR, he said.

“There was social conflict in the BTR due to political reasons but the accord has addressed the concerns of both Bodos and non-Bodos residing there and we are sure that this will usher in peace and development in the region,” he said.

The Bodo Peace Accord will be written in “golden words” in the history of Assam as the demand for a separate Bodoland ended with the signing of the accord yesterday,” he said.

The accord categorically mentions that it is a “final and comprehensive solution, keeping intact the territorial integrity of Assam.”

“This is very significant for the State of Assam as we had earlier lost Nagaland, Mizoram and Meghalaya but today due to the strong leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, all doubts regarding the further division of the State have been put to rest and hopes and aspirations of the Bodos given due respect,” Mr. Sarma said.

The BTC would be given maximum automony under the framework of the Constitution with the Centre and State government ready to transfer power to it.

Referring to the Bodos living in districts outside the BTR, the Minister said that Satellite Autonomous Councils would be set up and only Bodo villages will be included in it for their development and progress.

The accord has included a list of measures to be taken for the development and progess of the Bodos with complete autonomy, including appointment of Deputy Commissioners and Superintendents of Police in consultation with the Council.

Bodo language will be the Associate official language of the entire State while Assamese will be the official language.

The Accord is a historic development in the State and “this has been possible due to the mature leadership of the Bodo leaders and Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s love for Assam.”

The signing of the Accord with the Bodos and Brus in Tripura has brought hope for peace and development in the northeastern region.

“We have invited the Prime Minister and Union Home Minister to visit Kokrajhar on February 7 to bless the signing of this historic accord which will bring permanent peace in BTR,” Mr. Sarma said.

237,2020/01/28,Protests force Governor to leave Calcutta varsity convocation venue,"Unprecedented protests were witnessed on Tuesday at the convocation of the University of Calcutta, when the students forced West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who is also the Chancellor of the University, to leave the venue without attending the programme. He was supposed to confer D. Litt on Nobel laureate Abhijit Binayak Banerjee. Later in the day, the Governor tweeted that the “obstruction was managed” while Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee refused to comment about the imbroglio.

Mr. Banerjee, an alumnus of the 150-year institution, was conferred the honour only after the Governor had left the venue and the protest eased. The students stopped the event for almost 45 minutes by protesting in front of the stage raising slogans against the Governor and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. “No CAA, no NRC, no NPR” was theme of many placards held by the students who refused to budge despite repeated appeals by authorities.

The event could start only after Vice-Chancellor Sonali Chakravarty Bondhopadhyay’s assurance that the “Governor will not be present at the ceremony”. She also said the Governor will not lead the traditional academic procession of the scholars and the Senate members.

The Governor waited in the green room behind the stage where the Nobel laureate said he is willing to accept the award from him. Mr. Dhankhar, however, decided to leave the venue to let the event continue. While delivering his convocation address, Mr. Banerjee touched on the protests and added that it was “little bit hard for him to entirely comprehend it”.

Mr. Dhankhar later tweeted that the convocation “was at Nazrul Mancha auditorium and not on the campus of Calcutta University”.

“There was total failure of the State machinery to maintain law and order. The obstruction was stage managed. This happens to constitutional head. Where are we heading!” he asked.

While the Governor was not allowed to preside over the convocation of the State-run Jadavpur University, this was the first time in recent public memory that a ruckus was created at the convocation of one of the oldest universities in the country.

Neither Ms. Banerjee nor State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee was present at the convocation. A number of scholars of repute who were present were divided on the protests.

“We were students between 1968 and 1971 and participated in protests. But this is unacceptable,” said Samir K Brachmachari, biophysicist and former director of the Council of Science and Industrial Research. Manabi Majumdar, a social scientist, said the protest “against CAA and NRC is justified”.

Martin Logma, 27, was arrested on Monday and produced before a local court in Chakradharpur, which sent him to 14-days judicial custody, an official release said.

The other 15 accused, aged between 19 and 60 years, were arrested on Sunday and charged with murder and rioting, among others, it said.

They were produced before the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Chakradharpur on Monday which sent them to 14-days judicial custody, the release said.

Supporters of ‘Pathalgarhi’ movement had allegedly kidnapped the seven villagers of Burugulikera in Guddi block on January 21 and killed them for allegedly opposing their stir. Their mutilated bodies were recovered from a forest, around 4 kilometres from the village the next day.

239,2020/01/28,Centre ready to hold peace talks with ULFA(I): Himanta,"A day after the Bodo pact was signed, senior Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday said that the Centre is willing to hold peace talks with ULFA (Independent) faction and appealed to its leader Paresh Barua to come to the negotiating table.

Sarma, also the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convenor, told reporters here that Union Home Minister Amit Shah had clearly said on Monday that if the anti-talk ULFA(I) faction is ready for negotiations, then “the Centre is more than willing to hold dialogue with them for the sake of permanent peace in Assam and the Northeast.”

“A historic Accord was signed on Monday through discussions with all the factions of the NDFB. The Centre and state government want peace in the region through dialogue,” Sarma said, referring to the Bodo pact.

Most of the militant outfits in the northeastern states, barring some in Assam and Manipur, are holding talks but “if we want peace in the region, it should be inclusive by involving all the factions and the outfits,” he said.

240,2020/01/28,"Women teachers asked to get brides decked up in U.P., order revoked after row","A controversy broke out in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district on Monday after women school teachers were ordered to help brides get decked up for an official mass wedding programme.

The order was revoked a few hours later and a probe was proposed against the Block Education Officer who passed it after the issue led to much outrage.

Block Education Officer of Naugarh in Siddharthnagar Dhruv Prasad on Monday issued an order assigning 20 women teachers to help brides get ready for the programme under the Chief Minister’s Mass Wedding scheme to be conducted on Tuesday. The one-page order lists the names of the 20 teachers and asks them to reach the venue on January 28 by 9 a.m.

Suryakant Tripathi, Basic Education Officer of the district, said the order was “cancelled with immediate effect” when it came to his notice. “This is wrong. Duty cannot be assigned in such a manner,” Mr. Tripathi told The Hindu.

Mr. Tripathi said it was normal to ask one or two teachers to offer “assistance” at social functions for a couple of hours but keeping them engaged for the entire day would hamper the learning process.

“[If they are assigned the duty] they won’t go to school from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The school and the learning will get affected. If any social event is held here, they can send one teacher from a nearby school for a few hours to add to the participation as well as assist them,” said Mr. Tripathi.

“Consider the said order ineffective,” said Mr. Tripathi in his revocation order.

A. Dorendra works in a government corporation. Police sources said this was the third attempt to assassinate the engineer.

According to officials, houses in the immediate vicinity were also partially damaged in the attack. Though police rushed to the spot, no arrest was made. So far no rebel group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

A large number of women from the Thangjam Leikai area staged a sit-in protest against the bomb attack. They told presspersons that bomb attacks in crowded residential areas were reprehensible crimes. They should stop such senseless crimes, they told reporters.

Meanwhile, police said another bomb was recovered earlier on Sunday near the banks of the Imphal river in Waikhom Leikai. “It weighed over 3 kg and would have killed several persons and destroyed various constructions if the police had not defused it in time,” an official said.

244,2020/01/28,2G link offers patchy connectivity in Kashmir,"Nearly 65 lakh mobile phone users in the Kashmir Valley have failed to access the 301 “white-listed” websites through 2G connectivity restored two days ago after five-and-a-half months.

Network experts say the 2G technology is “incompatible with most dynamic websites”.

“2G is an obsolete technology. It was meant to access static websites and is completely incompatible with modern-day data-heavy dynamic websites,” Maroof Naieem Qadri, Director, IT, Kashmir University, told The Hindu.

Referring to the “whitelisted” sites of education allowed to access, especially those used by scholars, Mr. Qadri said it was almost impossible to retrieve high-data files from these websites. Mr. Qadri said the biggest trouble was for those who intended to make online payments on 2G technology.

“On a payment gateway, a user should be able to retrieve a certain amount of data within a time period. On 2G, it’s not possible to retrieve the data and a user may be logged out from the sessions repeatedly, making it impossible to pay online,” said Dr. Qadri, who himself failed to make a payment on makemytrip.com, a “whitelisted” site.

2G connectivity, restored on January 25 and barred again on January 26 for security reasons, works in bits and pieces in the Valley, people say.

Nazir Ahmad, an Airtel user, complained that he received a message on Monday morning: “Dear customer, as per the government order, the Internet facility has been temporarily stopped in your area.”

Scores of users fail to even connect with gmail and those who are lucky to connect fail to download any attachments. Tahoor Ahmad, a student at a Srinagar coaching centre, said he was unable to download the NEET syllabus of 2020 despite repeated attempts.

246,2020/01/28,Around 100 students from Gujarat stuck in epidemic-hit China,"With around 100 students from Gujarat stuck in epidemic-hit China, Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Monday sought the help of the Ministry of External Affairs for safe return of students including those in Wuhan, epicentre of the coronavirus which has gripped the Chinese city, claiming 80 persons and infecting hundreds.

Mr. Rupani urged External Affairs Minister Jaishankar to intervene after parents had sought help from the BJP government here for their safe return.

In a press statement issued here, the Gujarat government said 100 students mostly studying medicine from the State are stuck in China about which Mr. Rupani had spoken to Mr. Jaishankar on the phone. The Gujarat government was prompted into action after Vadodara resident Shashi Jaiman on Monday tweeted tagging Chief Minister informing that his 18-year-old daughter, studying medicine in Wuhan, was stuck there.

“My daughter Shreya Jaiman is studying in te Hubei University for MBBS in Wuhan city of China. There are nearly about 300 students of India in which 100 Gujarati who are stuck there due to coronavirus. Please take necessary steps to take them back to India. Vadodara (Guj),” he posted in a tweet tagging the Chief Minister.

In deep trouble

Mr. Jaiman told mediapersons in Vadodara, “My daughter told us she is not getting food and water since the last two days as markets and establishments have been shut down following the virus outbreak. She is in deep trouble and we have appealed to the government to intervene for their safe return.”

He claimed 20 students from Gujarat were studying in the university there and all were in a bad state due to the lockdown caused by the virus. The toll due to the virus rose to 81 with confirmed cases reaching 1,975 and 324 of them being critical, Chinese health authorities said in an official statement on Monday.

Coronavirus, officially described as 2019-nCoV, cases were first reported from Wuhan, the capital of central China’s Hubei province. A few cases have been found in other countries including South Korea, Japan, Thailand and the United States. The virus can cause fever, coughing, sneezing and pneumonia.

247,2020/01/28,Modi must see Dalit-Adivasi unity against CAA: Yogendra Yadav,"Swaraj Abhiyan president Yogendra Yadav on Monday said although Prime Minister Narendra Modi claimed that anti-CAA protesters could be identified by their clothes, and saw only skullcaps and hijabs among them, he must also witness the coming together of Adivasis and Dalits to oppose the contentious Act and notice another piece of cloth: the Tricolour.

“I wish he was here today to witness Adivasi women, the youth and other citizens coming together to protest,” said Mr. Yadav at a gathering in Barwani. More than 15,000 people from Dalit, tribal, labour and students groups took part in a rally, the first such large-scale, unified protest in Madhya Pradesh against the law, the proposed nationwide implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

Demand for resolution

The participants, under the banner of ‘Samvidhan Jan Bachao Andolan’, called upon the Congress government in the State to pass a resolution in the Vidhan Sabha to not implement the NPR, and in effect purportedly stymie the build-up to the NRC. So far, Rajasthan, Kerala and West Bengal have passed resolutions against the CAA.

“The Central government had no shame asking us for votes, but today it is asking us to prove our citizenship,” said Medha Patkar, leader of the Narmada Bachao Andolan. “This is unacceptable. Hum kaagaz nahin dikhayenge (we will not show our papers),” she said while addressing the rally.

Social activist Harsh Mander claimed mostly Dalit and tribal labourers were excluded from the NRC in Assam, and thus the NPR and NRC wouldn’t affect only one community, but the whole country.

“People who work in the fields to feed the nation and labourers who are exploited in the name of progress do not need to furnish proof of citizenship. Rather, it is the government that needs to prove its allegiance to the country, that it can deliver people’s demands for employment, fair price for produce and the rights to education and health,” said Harsingh Jamre, an adivasi.

Amid slogans of ‘Samvidhan Bachao, Desh Bachao’, a protester said, ‘We have always fought for our constitutional rights in our communities, and now have united to fight against this attack on the Constitution. This is the beginning of a unified movement against the NPR-NRC-CAA, and it will not end until the government concedes our demands.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/modi-must-see-dalit-adivasi-unity-against-caa-yogendra-yadav/article30670311.ece
248,2020/01/28,Tribals in Odisha protest over rejection of applications for forest rights,"Alleging arbitrary cancellation of applications for land rights under the Forest Rights Act by the administration, over 2,000 tribals began an indefinite dharna in front of the Collector’s office at Chhatrapur in Odisha’s Ganjam district on Monday.

They alleged that of the total rejected applications, the highest number was from Ganjam, around 50% of total rejections in the State. The protesters were united by four organisations — All India Kisan Mazdoor Sabha, Adivasi Bharat Mahasabha, Ganjam Zilla Adivasi Manch and Ganjam Zilla Gramsabha Samukhya.

The protesters have a list of nine demands which are mostly related to land rights of forest dwellers.

According to the protesters, 13,851 applications were cancelled by the State administration. Of these, 6,613 are from Ganjam district — 3,346 of tribals and 2,967 of other forest dwellers. AIKMS national secretary Bhala Chandra Sarangi alleged that the administration has not given any reason for cancellation.

249,2020/01/28,Visva-Bharati students demand V-C’s resignation over campus violence,"On Monday, a group of students of Visva-Bharati University held a noisy demonstration demanding the resignation of Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty, while a general body meeting of the teachers’ union condemned the “high-handed” behaviour of the authorities.

“We wanted to take out a big procession to the central office but found the place under heavy security. They have declared it a no-disturbance zone. So we held a demonstration at the Upasana Griha and shouted slogans,” said Falguni Pan, one of the student leaders.

The students accuse the Vice-Chancellor of turning Visva-Bharati into a right-wing institution and also for inciting the violence that broke out in the campus on January 15, when some students belonging to the Left-wing organisations were injured in an attack by a rival group. The university has rejected both allegations.

The violence followed anti-CAA protests on the campus and a lecture on CAA delivered by BJP ideologue Swapan Dasgupta.

“We will continue our agitation... we will resist all attempts to saffronise the university,” said Ms. Pan.

Meanwhile, teacher’s union Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association said that it was being made a scapegoat even though it has not openly or actively supported the agitating students.

“On January 15, our office was locked up. This, in spite of a notification issued November last year, recognising us as a voluntary organisation. The Vice-Chancellor has clearly made us a scapegoat for his mismanagement,” VBUFA president Sudipta Bhattacharyya said.

“The general body meeting condemned the closure of our office. It also condemned the high-handed manner in which the Vice-Chancellor is functioning,” Mr. Bhattacharyya alleged.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/visva-bharati-students-demand-v-cs-resignation-over-campus-violence/article30670048.ece
250,2020/01/28,"‘Release activists, no need for NIA probe’","Former Bombay High Court judge, Justice (retired) B.G. Kolse-Patil on Monday lashed out at the Union Home Ministry’s sudden decision to transfer the investigation into the Elgaar Parishad-Bhima Koregaon cases to National Investigation Agency (NIA), alleging that the Narendra Modi government feared an expose of the “false probe” conducted by the Maharashtra police.

“A BJP government was in the State at the time of the Bhima-Koregaon clashes [January 1, 2018] which occurred a day after the Elgaar Parishad. While it had allowed the State to conduct investigations at the time, what was the need for the Central government now to take over the case and hand it over to NIA. The Centre’s abrupt transferring of the case to the NIA has laid bare Pune police’s conspiracy [into the Bhima-Koregaon clashes] before the public. It is in keeping with the Modi government’s crackdown against minorities, Ambedkarite and tribal activism,” alleged Mr. Kolse-Patil, who, along with retired Supreme Court judge P. B. Sawant, was among the chief organisers of Elgaar Parishad on December 31, 2017.

Speaking in Pune, along with representatives from other social outfits, Mr. Kolse-Patil further said that in spite of FIRs being lodged against Hindutva leaders Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote within the first eight days of the clashes, the latter was out on bail and the former was not even probed by the authorities.

“We demand that the case be removed from the NIA’s hands and that the arrested activists be released forthwith. This is purely a move on the Centre’s part to prolong the trial of the incarcerated activists,” said Mr. Kolse-Patil.

He further claimed that the allegedly false probe by the Maharashtra police into the case and the subsequent branding of several noted progressives as ‘urban naxals’ was a deliberate ploy on part of the BJP government at the Centre to tarnish Justice (retd.) Sawant, who had recommended that Prime Minister Modi and Union Minister Amit Shah be prosecuted for their alleged roles in the 2002 Gujarat riots.

“At the time, when Justice Sawant had served on an Indian People’s Tribunal headed by justice V.R. Krishna Iyer to probe the Gujarat riots, he had indicted both Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah and had recommended that no constitutional post be given to them. So, the Modi government at the Centre is now getting back at us by branding participants in the Elgaar Parishad as ‘urban naxals’ and labelling and arresting those activists who weren’t even present during the event,” he said.

Anjum Inamdar, founder of the Mulnivasi Muslim Manch, said that the Pune Police, instead of bringing to book the perpetrators behind the clashes, had hatched a conspiracy against noted human rights activists and intellectuals by branding them as ‘urban naxals’.

In the aftermath of the Bhima-Koregaon riots of Jnauary 2018, the Pune city police, in its controversial probe, had stated that the Elgaar Parishad had triggered the Bhima-Koregaon clashes – a theory vehemently denied by several other activists and Justices (retd.) Sawant and Kolse-Patil.

The Pune police have booked 22 people and arrested nine eminent activist-intellectuals, including human rights lawyer Surendra Gadling, Nagpur University English Professor Shoma Sen, trade unionist Sudha Bharadwaj and Vernon Gonsalves among others in connection with the Elgaar Parishad, the Bhima-Koregaon clashes, and for alleged links with the Maoists.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jju5g5/article30669858.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMKOLSEPATIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/release-activists-no-need-for-nia-probe/article30669859.ece
251,2020/01/28,"Coronavirus: Three quarantined in Pune, Mumbai","Three people, including two men aged 40 and another in his 30s from Pune, and a 36-year-old man from Mumbai, have been quarantined as a precautionary measure to curb the novel strain of Coronavirus (nCoV) that has led to an outbreak in China. While the Mumbai patient, a resident of Tardeo, had visited Shanghai and Guangzhou, the 40-year-old from Pune had recently travelled to Shanghai.

BMC’s executive health officer Dr. Padmaja Keskar said that the Tardeo resident had cough since the past five days and has had one episode of fever on Sunday. “The patient stayed in Shanghai from January 3 to 7 and then in Guangzhou from January 7 to 11. He took a flight via Hong Kong and landed in Mumbai on January 11,” said Dr. Keskar adding that he has no history of contact with any person with similar illness or history of travel to a fish market.

“The patient is vitally stable and has been put on symptomatic treatment,” said Dr. Keskar. According to the Centere for Disease Control and Prevention, many of the patients in the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by nCoV in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.

State’s epidemiologist Dr. Pradeep Awate said that the Pune patient had returned to Mumbai on January 10 and developed symptoms after which he was placed under isolation on Monday.

Negative so far

Meanwhile, three patients quarantined earlier in Mumbai have tested negative for nCoV but continue to be under observation. State health officials who drafted a discharge policy for these patients said that they will continue to remain in the isolation ward till their repeat samples also test negative. “Fresh samples will be collected on fourth day of admission and once these repeat samples test negative, the patients will be discharged,” said Dr. Archana Patil of Directorate of Health Services (DHS), Maharashtra.

As many as 3,756 travellers were screened till January 26 at the Mumbai airport, including 15 from Maharashtra. Of these, four are now admitted in Mumbai and two in Pune. The State health officials have urged people to call 104 helpline for queries about nCoV. The Union Health Ministry maintained that passengers were being screened at 7 airports in India and risk communication and self-declaration were being done at 12 other airports.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less severe ailments, such as the common cold, and others more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

According to the World Health Organization, as on January 25, a total of 1,320 confirmed cases on nCoV have been reported globally, of which 1,297 were from China, including Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) (5 confirmed cases), Macau SAR (2 confirmed cases) and Taipei (3 confirmed cases).

252,2020/01/28,Pawar’s promotion draws attention to Awhad,"Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar’s promotion of Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad as the one ‘who will change the lives of people of Maharashtra’ has set tongues wagging.

Mr. Pawar made the remarks at a public felicitation of Mr. Awhad at Kalwa in the latter’s Assembly constituency. This is the first time that the NCP chief has attended such ceremony for any of his party ministers since the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.

Interestingly, all NCP heavyweights including Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, Irrigation Minister Jayant Patil, Labour and Excise Minister Dilip Walse-Patil and Social Justice Minister Dhananjay Munde have been publicly felicitated in their respective constituencies, but none was attended by the NCP chief.

The promotion of Mr. Awhad, who is also known as Mr. Pawar’s ‘blue-eyed boy’, and entrusting him with the important Housing portfolio is seen as an attempt to bring him to the centre stage of State politics.

An OBC leader with a city base, Mr. Awhad enjoys popularity among the Ambedkarite, Muslim and Maratha communities alike. He was also the first in the State to raise doubt over the Bhima-Koregaon riot investigation of previous BJP-led government and allege snooping on important leaders of the Opposition.

While lauding Mr. Awhad at Kalwa, Mr. Pawar said, “I always tell my workers look at the change in Mumbra-Kalwa to learn what leader who is active and ready to work for the people can do. I appeal to the people here to continue supporting him in this manner. I guarantee that he will be able to change the lives of people in the State.” The NCP chief remembered how the State’s first chief minister, late Yashvantrao Chavan, heard his speech once and called him. “That was the beginning of my career’s growth,” he said.

“I am humbled by the words of Mr. Pawar. My political career is because of him and I will follow him always,” Mr. Awhad said, when asked about the NCP chief’s comment.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pawars-promotion-draws-attention-to-awhad/article30669823.ece
253,2020/01/28,Munde calls attention to Marathwada water woes with day-long fast,"Riven with disaffection in recent times, the Maharashtra unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday projected a united front during a day-long fast over Marathwada’s water problems staged by former minister Pankaja Munde in Aurangabad city.

Stating that the intent behind her fast was to draw the attention of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government to Marathwada’s water woes, Ms. Munde said her fast “was not one of protest or criticism against the government, but the Opposition’s expectation from it”.

“I am not holding this fast to hanker after any position within the party nor is it meant to criticise the working of the MVA, which has barely completed 100 days. This fast is only to convey the expectations that the farmers and people of Marathwada have from the government with respect to the vital problem of water,” she said, while fasting in front of the Aurangabad District Collectorate.

Ms. Munde said the objective behind the fast was to draw the government’s attention to the farmer suicides and migration from the region. “While our government has done a lot of work for Marathwada, I would urge Mr. Thackeray to expedite the water projects started by us,” she said.

Ms. Munde along with senior BJP leader Eknath Khadse had openly expressed her disgruntlement against the party’s State leadership in general and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis in particular. The disaffection of the OBC faction within the party towards the leadership had threatened to split the BJP wide open.

However, Mr. Fadnavis, along with Union Minister Raosaheb Danve, former speaker Haribhau Bagade, and Pravin Darekar, the BJP’s LoP in the Council, joined Ms. Munde during her fast to emphasise that there was no rift within the party.

Lauding Ms. Munde’s leadership, Mr. Fadnavis warned the MVA that the BJP would take to the streets if the government stopped or failed to implement the water projects begun by it.

“Even if Ms. Munde’s fast today is a symbolic one, it will not remain so if the government does not implement the projects that we had taken up to bring water to Marathwada. This region was always sidelined when the erstwhile Congress-NCP government was in power. Their leaders had always diverted water that was due to Marathwada to western Maharashtra. It was we who approached Prime Minister Modi, who then gave his assent for the ₹4,000 crore Krishna-Marathwada project,” Mr. Fadnavis said.

Claiming that the ‘Jal Yukt Shivar’ scheme started by his government was a revolutionary water project, Mr. Fadnavis warned the MVA government of intensifying agitation if it dared to scrap any project that was in the interests of the people of Marathwada.

“All arrangements are in place thanks to our government. The present government only has to give assent and implement projects already started by us. The work that our government has done must be taken forward. You [MVA] may even take credit or change the name of the projects started by us, but do not harm the interests of the people by scrapping them…Today, we [the BJP] have only come to awaken you. If you take these projects ahead, we will support you, but if you try to delay projects, we will hit the streets tomorrow,” Mr. Fadnavis said.

Ms. Munde’s fast met with jeers from All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen leader and Aurangabad MP Imitiaz Jaleel, who dubbed it “a farce”. “What were Ms. Munde and the Fadnavis government doing when the BJP was in power. How can they think the people are such fools by holding fasts? The BJP was in power at the Centre and the State, but they didn’t do anything for Marathwada then,” Mr. Jaleel said.

Likewise, senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal took potshots at Ms. Munde and the BJP, saying, “If the BJP had indeed worked during the five years it had been given the chance, their leaders would not be sitting on fasts or talking of launching agitations now.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/munde-calls-attention-to-marathwada-water-woes-with-day-long-fast/article30669775.ece
254,2020/01/28,Bhima-Koregaon case: plea seeks cross-examination of Fadnavis,"After the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the Elgaar Parishad cases from the Maharashtra government, the Bhima-Koregaon Inquiry Commission on Monday admitted an application demanding the cross-examination of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis.

The application filed by Dr. Sanjay Lakhe Patil, an intervenor and president of Karmaveer Pratishtan, made several pleas including calling the former chief minister in as a witness who need to be cross-examined for his ‘misleading’ statements in the Assembly. The commission is likely to take a call on passing an order on the application during its next hearing on Wednesday.

In a statement made last year, Mr. Fadnavis did not blame the ‘urban naxals’ for the violence that followed the Elgaar Parishad. Rather, he confessed that the riots were instigated by Hindutva leaders Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, with the help of their supporters, the petition claims. The application also claims that the erstwhile BJP government in the State, while investigating and labelling thinkers, professors and lawyers as ‘urban naxals’, did not at all look into the role of the real culprits (Hindutva leaders).

“Therefore, I urge the commission to call for all records of phone, mobile records, police control room records, wireless records of the day of the incident in areas of Bhima-Koregaon, Vadu and Sanaswadi,” Mr. Patil said, accusing local police of escorting and giving safe passage to those who were involved in stone pelting and torching vehicles.

“The statements of the former chief minister tried covering and protecting the Hindutva leaders. The statement did not reflect on the fact the local police protected several bikers carrying saffron flags during the violence,” he said, claiming it was important to call Mr. Fadnavis since his statements contradict the investigation of the police.

The BJP leader had last week called the action of the NIA taking over ‘urban naxal’ cases as correct while accusing the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of sabotaging the Pune Police’s investigations in the Elgaar Parishad and Bhima-Koregaon cases. “The Pune Police had worked very hard to expose urban naxals in this case. But some people with the intention of suppressing the police were trying to reopen the case,” he had said, referring to the government’s efforts to set up an SIT in the case.

The application accuses Mr. Fadnavis of shielding the accused under the guise of his privileges in the Assembly. The Bhima-Koregaon Commission was set up by the previous government under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1955.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ohl0gj/article30669745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMFADNAVISBHIDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bhima-koregaon-case-plea-seeks-cross-examination-of-fadnavis/article30669746.ece

257,2020/01/28,Coonoor municipality bans disposable pens in its office,"In order to highlight how our dependence on plastics extends to even the ballpoint pens we use to write with, the Coonoor Municipality has banned the use of disposable plastic pens in its office starting this week.

Coonoor Municipality Commissioner K. Balu said that people’s dependence on plastics and our reliance on “use and throw” items such as ballpoint pens was having a tremendous impact on the environment. “Plastic bottles, cans and other single-use items are easily noticeable when they get strewn by the roads or are collected at waste management centres. However, small plastic products we use each day, like pens, have just as big an impact on the environment and local wildlife, though they remain almost invisible to us,” said Mr. Balu.

He said that the ballpoint pens had been outlawed in the Coonoor Municipality office from this week, and over 30 staff working there were given fountain pens to accomplish government work on Monday. “We asked the staff to hand in their ballpoint pens and we received around 50 just from our offices alone,” said Mr. Balu.

Welcoming the initiative, P. J. Vasanthan, trustee of “Clean Coonoor,” an NGO working alongside the Coonoor Municipality in managing the waste generated in the town, said that small plastic items such as pens invariably do not get segregated and recycled. “The problem is that they are just too small to be effectively segregated from the waste pile, and invariably end up in landfill,” he said. Mr. Vasanthan also said he hoped that the municipality’s proactive efforts would inspire other government officers, staff and even school students and teachers, to shun ballpoint pens and instead use fountain pens, so that the amount of waste generated can be reduced at source.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coonoor-municipality-bans-disposable-pens-in-its-office/article30677605.ece
258,2020/01/28,"Tractors meant for agricultural purposesused for transporting bricks, allege activists","Tractors meant for agricultural purposes are widely used to transport bricks and red earth mined illegally in Thadagam Valley, activists fighting against illegal operation of brick kilns here alleged.

On Tuesday, a tractor rammed the compound wall of the Government Boys Higher Secondary School at Chinna Thadagam around 11.45 a.m. Students who were playing in the ground ran away in panic as nearly 20 feet of the wall collapsed. It is alleged that the tractor driver was on duty for a brick unit.

S. Ganesh from Thadagam, who is involved in a legal battle against illegal operations of brick kilns in the valley, alleged that the tractor involved in the accident belonged to a policeman, who along with his brother working in Tamil Nadu Prison Department, runs a unit making unbaked bricks. The Central Government’s ‘Vahan’ e-services shows the vehicle listed under the class ‘agricultural tractor’ and Senthil Kumar A. as its owner.

“In November, the district administration had served notices on 141 unauthorised brick kilns and directed to stop production. The same month, the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board also served notices on brick kilns as they had not obtained operational permit. Recently, the Local Planning Authority too said in a reply under the Right to Information Act that it had not given permission to any units, which is mandatory to get electricity connection. Now the accident attests that tractors meant for agricultural purposes are also used for transporting bricks,” Ganesh said.

Environmental activist K. Mohanraj alleged that various relaxations were allowed for tractors meant for agricultural purposes.

He said that Thadagam T.M.S. Rajendran had petitioned K. Kumaravel, Regional Transport Officer, Coimbatore North, two months ago highlighting the use of tractors meant for agricultural purposes in various stages of brick making.

Mr. Kumaravel said that the Road Transport Authority was conducting checks to prevent commercial or industrial use of such tractors. He added that a meeting of tractor owners was planned to instruct them on rules to be followed.

When contacted, the headmaster of the school said that the person who transported the bricks had promised to repair the damaged wall in a few days, a condition which was accepted by higher officials of the Education Department in the district. Thadagam sub-inspector Pon Rajesh said that the police did not receive any complaint from the school authorities regarding the incident.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/uwkl8h/article30677521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB29TRACTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tractors-meant-for-agricultural-purposesused-for-transporting-bricks-allege-activists/article30677522.ece

“Garment exporters in Tiruppur buy a lot of accessories from China and to some extent, fabric too. Most of these transactions are handled through online communication. But if the outbreak is not controlled and the travel restrictions continue for a longer period of time, exporters here will be affected. Right now, it is Chinese New Year there and so there is not much business taking place.But we need to wait and watch,” says Raja Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters’ Association.

Another knitwear exporter, who did not want to be named, said that buyers from the west are not travelling to China and that Chinese are not visiting other countries. If this situation continues, India might get some of the opportunities as the buyers will look at alternative countries to source their need, he said, adding however that the impact of the outbreak is only in a particular region and hence, the exporters need to see how the situation develops.

Another sector here that exports to China is the coir industry in Pollachi. Representatives of quite a few Chinese buyers reside in Pollachi. “They have all gone home for Chinese New Year.

260,2020/01/28,Activists call for strict action against trespassers to Kalhatti Falls,"The death of two youngsters who are believed to have drowned in Kalhatti Falls outside Udhagamandalam town, has led to activists calling for more stringent action against trespassers.

The waterfall, which has been officially closed to tourists for over four years due to a number of fatalities and injuries to visiting tourists, continues to remain a popular tourist spot as many illegal safari operators also include the waterfall as part of the tourist trail for people visiting Udhagamandalam and the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR). On Sunday, two youngsters, part of a group of seven who ventured into the area, are believed to have drowned in the plunge pool of the waterfall, with their bodies remaining untraceable.

G. Janardhanan, president of the Ooty Public Awareness Association, said that as a first step, there needs to be prominent signage installed at the entry points to the waterfall, clearly stating the danger of visiting the area, the number of people who have died there and also specifying that the area has been closed to tourists. “Many tourists do not even know that going to the waterfall is illegal and they are trespassing into a reserve forest,” said Mr. Janardhanan. “The Forest Department even has a checkpost a few meters away from the road leading to the waterfall. They should instruct the personnel stationed there to stop people from using the road,” he added.

District Forest Officer, Nilgiris division, D. Guruswamy, said that agriculturalists in the area had insisted the Forest Department to keep the road open so that they could access farmlands located along the slopes bordering the waterfall. “We will now definitely take stringent action against people who illegally venture into the area,” Mr. Guruswamy said.

261,2020/01/28,Mass of hair removed from teenage girl’s stomach,"Medical team of a private hospital in Coimbatore recently removed a mass of hair and foreign particles of about half kg from a 13-year-old girl’s stomach.

The mass, known as trichobezoar in medical parlance, developed after the girl plucked her own hair and ingested it over a period of around six months, reportedly in a state of depression following the death of her relative.

After removing the mass in a laparoscopic procedure that lasted for about one-and-a-half hours, the girl was given psychiatric counselling.

V.G. Mohan Prasad, gastroenterologist and chairman of VGM Gastro Centre, said that the girl from Coimbatore had come to the hospital with complaints of severe stomach pain.

“The mass in the stomach was identified through an endoscopy and we decided to remove it through a laparoscopic surgery. Surgical gastroenterologist Gokul Kruba Shankar and team removed the mass using an ‘endobag’ so that not even a single strand of hair was left after the procedure,” he said.

Dr. Prasad said that it was the first case of a huge trichobezoar that doctors came across in his facility.

262,2020/01/28,Forest Department sets up camera traps to monitor possible movement of tiger,"The Forest Department has set up camera traps at Srimadurai in Gudalur, to ascertain if a carnivore was preying on cattle in the area.

The residents of the area had complained to the Forest Department that a carnivore, which they claim to be a tiger, had killed four cows and a few goats over the last two months.

After the latest incident over the weekend, the department set up three camera traps in the surrounding area where the carcass of the cow was found, to photograph the animal.

G. Ramakrishnan, Forest Range Officer, Gudalur Forest Range, said that the animal had preyed on two cattle over the last few days, prompting the department to step up vigilance in the area.

“As the area where the cattle were lifted is very close to the border of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, it is possible that the animal responsible could be a tiger,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan, who said that the camera traps would continue to function.

Forest department officials said that 20 watchers and guards from both the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and the Gudalur forest range have been posted in the area to respond to any emergencies reported from the area. They said that footage from the camera traps set up on Sunday had been reviewed and there was no evidence of any movement of tigers in the area. “It could be that the animal has moved out of the area, but we will continue monitoring the situation,” a forest department official said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/a70z2x/article30671731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OT28CAMERATRAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/forest-department-sets-up-camera-traps-to-monitor-possible-movement-of-tiger/article30671732.ece

269,2020/01/28,Suez contract: DMK to protest on January 29,"Coimbatore urban unit of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam would stage a protest near the Coimbatore South Taluk Office on January 29 against the Coimbatore Corporation for failing to annul its contract with Suez India Pvt. Ltd. for water distribution.

The Corporation entering into the contract for 26 years with the company was unacceptable as the company’s parent organisation was alleged to have committed malpractices in countries it worked, the unit in-charge and Singanallur MLA N. Karthik said here at a press meet on Monday.

Though the DMK had raised the Corporation’s contract with Suez issue both within and without the Assembly, neither the State Government nor the Corporation was forthcoming in sharing the details. This strengthened the party’s suspicion that the two had something to hide.

Mr. Karthik said the protest was also against the Corporation’s plan to build micro compost centres on reserved sites, parks and playgrounds.

The city’s residents and his party were opposed to the project, what with the Corporation’s poor track record on solid waste management.

The Corporation should consider implementing the micro compost centre project at places that were away from human habitation.

The Coimbatore City Police had thus far not given permission for the protest. This only showed that they were functioning at the behest of the ruling party and attempting to stifle the rights of the opposition party.

Notwithstanding the police permission, the DMK would go ahead and protest, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/suez-contract-dmk-to-protest-on-january-29/article30669371.ece
270,2020/01/28,U-19 World Cup | Tyagi powers Men in Blue into semifinals,"Pacer Kartik Tyagi blew away the Australian top-order with a sensational spell to power India into the semifinals of the ICC U-19 World Cup with a comfortable 74-run win here on Tuesday.

Tyagi’s four wickets came after India recovered through Atharva Ankolekar’s combative half-century to reach 233 for nine, a modest total which the holder defended in impressive fashion.

Riding on Tyagi’s spell — in which he swung the ball at a good speed — India bundled out Australia for 159 with 6.3 overs to spare in their Super League quarterfinal.

Vital partnership

Asked to bat, India lacked a substantial partnership until Atharva and Ravi Bishnoi joined forces to raise a fighting 61-run stand for the seventh wicket.

Atharva scored an unbeaten 55 off 54 balls with five fours and a six, while Bishnoi made 30 off 31 balls.

Tyagi (four for 24) produced a dream spell in which he removed Australia skipper Mackenzie Harvey (4) and Lachlan Hearne (0) off successive balls in his very first over.

This was after Jake Fraser-McGurk had run himself out in the very first ball of the innings.

Tyagi did not get a hat-trick, but added the scalps of Oliver Davies (2) and Patrick Rowe (21) to take the life out of the Australian chase.

Top-order polished off

India’s modest total would have given the Australians hope, but it became a herculean task after their top-order was polished off.

Opener Sam Fanning (75) kept fighting from one end but it only delayed the inevitable. He added 81 runs for the sixth wicket with Liam Scott (35).

When Australia required 85 off the last 10 overs, spinner Bishnoi broke the stand by getting rid of Scott, while left-arm pacer Akash Singh sent back Fanning.

The writing was on the wall after that as Akash (3/30) wrapped up the match by adding the wickets of Todd Murphy and Matthew Willans to his tally.

Jaiswal fights

Earlier, only opener Yashaswi Jaiswal put up a semblance of resistance against the Australian attack, scoring an 82-ball 62 with the help of six fours and two sixes.

Divyaansh Saxena (14), Tilak Varma (2), Priyan Garg (5) and Dhruv Juel (15) all struggled.

After losing one partner after another, Jaiswal went for a pull off Tanveer Sangha but edged the ball between his legs on to the stumps.

Before Sangha came on to bowl, bespectacled off-spinner Todd Murphy (2/40) frequently troubled the Indian batsmen.

Jurel, whose technique looked compact, timed the ball well but often found the fielders. Not being able to find the gaps meant his scoring rate was quite low.

Jaiswal, who was fluent in his stroke-making, had already departed and it adversely affected India’s run rate.

Under pressure, Jurel went after Murphy but ballooned the ball up for wicketkeeper Rowe to take an easy catch.

271,2020/01/28,Ranji Trophy | Southpaw Mulani sheds white-ball specialist tag,"One of the brightest spots in an otherwise inconsistent campaign for Mumbai has been Shams Mulani’s consistent outings. Be it with his left-arm orthodox spin or his crucial fifties lower down the order, the southpaw has been impressive all through this Ranji Trophy season.

Throughout his development from Mumbai’s age-group squads, Mulani has built a reputation of a shrewd cricketer with a never-say-die attitude. While he has translated his ability to see the team through in crunch situations in both departments even at the First Class level, his performances with the ball have helped him shed the “white-ball specialist” tag.

Helping hand

Bowling up front and even at the death in T20s and 50-over games, Mulani had made a name for himself and even represented India at the Emerging Asia Cup in Sri Lanka in December 2018. At the same time, the now 22-year-old had started doubting his own ability with the red-ball with everyone around him stressing he was a white-ball bowler. Mulani revealed that a discussion with Narendra Hirwani, the legendary leg-spinner-turned-coach, helped him change his perspective.

“I was going through that phase and then I went to Sri Lanka with the U-23s (Emerging Asia Cup) and met Hirwani sir over there. He was the bowling coach. I just asked him very casually whether white-ball / red-ball bowlers are different and he said: there’s nothing like that. It’s all in your mind. You just have to tweak a bit, not too much, it’s just in your mind that you bowl better with white-ball,” Mulani revealed at the HPCA stadium on Tuesday.

Spot-bowling

Having honed his skills at the iconic Shivaji Park Gymkhana under the tutelage of Pravin Amre and Padmakar Shivalkar, Mulani admitted that an additional thrust on spot-bowling has helped him improve his consistency with the ball.

“I try to bowl as much as I can. Spot-bowling is very important, I feel, and I try to do. After the nets, after my batting is done, I catch hold of Pradeep Sundaram (bowling coach) and ask him to set the cones for me and he is ever willing to help me out,” he said. “Purpose is very important rather than going through the drills. Enjoyment is different but you need to be serious where you need to be.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/705o9h/article30676293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29MULANI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/southpaw-mulani-sheds-white-ball-specialist-tag/article30676295.ece

273,2020/01/28,Prashanth Kumar helps Andhra take the lead,"Andhra crawled to the first innings lead against Kerala on the second day of the Group A Ranji Trophy encounter here on Tuesday.

In reply to Kerala’s first innings score of 162, the host made 255 before being bowled out shortly before stumps — that’s a a handy lead of 93 with two days remaining.

Andhra wasn’t helped by a disciplined attack by Kerala. None of the six bowlers delivered a no-ball or wide.

Resuming at 57 for one, Andhra suffered an early setback when Jyothi Sai Krishna was bowled by Basil Thampi in the fourth over of the morning.

But, the other overnight batsman D.B. Prashanth Kumar showed plenty of application to ensure his team took the first-innings lead — not that it could mean much in the end in a match that is likely to produce a decisive result, that too with time to spare.

By the time Prashanth was bowled by Jalaj Saxena, who was captaining Kerala for the first time, the opener had faced 237 balls for his 79 (11x4). When it came to the strike rate, he had stiff competition from the Andhra wicket-keeper, though.

U.M.S. Girinath, who was making his debut, scored 41 off 134 balls before he was caught behind off Thampi. By comparison, N. Nithish Kumar Reddy, another debutant, made 39 off 60 balls (3x4, 1x6) before he too was bowled by Jalaj.

The skipper finished with three for 56. Thampi also took three wickets, giving away just 43 runs from 21.5 overs.

The scores:

Kerala — Ist Innings: 162.

274,2020/01/28,Stuart Broad fined for ‘audible obscenity’ during Johannesburg Test,"England fast bowler Stuart Broad has been fined 15% of his match fee for “use of an audible obscenity” during the fourth Test against South Africa.

Broad was cited by the match officials after Monday’s incident in Johannesburg, when he approached South Africa captain Faf du Plessis and used “inappropriate language”.

He was found to have breached article 2.3 of the International Cricket Council’s code of conduct, which relates to “use of an audible obscenity during an international match”.

One demerit point has been added to Broad’s disciplinary record. It was the second offence in a 24-month period for the bowler.

When a player reaches four or more demerit points within a 24-month period, they are converted into suspension points and a player is banned.

275,2020/01/28,India poised for first T20 series win in New Zealand,"A ruthless India are expected to seal their maiden T20 International series win in New Zealand and only a special comeback from the struggling hosts in the third game here on Wednesday can delay what seems inevitable.

India won the twin T20 Internationals in Auckland by margins of six and seven wickets respectively to go 2-0 up in the five-match series.

A third successive win at Seddon Park will give them their first ever T20I series’ win on New Zealand soil, a feat they were unable to achieve on two occasions previously. India lost 0-2 under Mahendra Singh Dhoni back in 2008-09, and last year, they went down 1-2.

Overall, this Indian side has seen an uptick in fortunes and are unbeaten in five T20 series since the 2019 ODI World Cup, including the ongoing one against the Black Caps. The only contest they didn’t win was against South Africa, when the three-match series ended 1-1 after one of the games was washed out.

However, their current winning form in T20 cricket won’t lead to any meaningful change in the ICC rankings. India are currently placed fifth in the T20I rankings, and need to win the remaining three matches — this series 5-0 — to move up to fourth from their current fifth spot.

New Zealand are currently placed sixth. Pakistan, Australia, England and South Africa, in that order, sit ahead in the rankings’ table.

The greater concern at present is building towards the T20 World Cup to be hosted in Australia later this year. In that regard though, the team management is quietly confident that various pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are starting to fall into place, and at the right time.

This is specifically boosted by the performances of KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer over the recent months, particularly on tour thus far.

As such, there are no changes to be expected in the Indian line-up for the third T20. On Tuesday, there was an optional practice session with skipper Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah, the ones missing in action.

The support staff worked closely with those players who haven’t yet received a chance to play in the series yet. Ravi Shastri paid close attention to Washington Sundar, while batting coach Vikram Rathour was busy with Rishabh Pant. Both are expected to sit out again on Wednesday.

There is possibility of one change to the Indian line-up. Kuldeep Yadav sat out the first two matches in Auckland, and that could have been a move motivated more by the ground size than anything else.

Chahal provides greater control and his wrist spin moves away from the majority of right-handers in the Black Caps’ line-up, thus against the arc of swing.

Yadav is a tad more adventurous in his flight and the angle of his spin into the right-handers could have been easy fodder at Eden Park’s short boundaries.

Whether Yadav comes back into contention at the regular-sized Seddon Park remains to be seen. Additionally, there is little chance of Chahal-Yadav playing together, a move India have shied away from since the ODI World Cup.

From New Zealand’s perspective, this is the last opportunity for Colin de Grandhomme to make an impression. The all-rounder will be replaced in the squad for the last two T20Is by batsman Tom Bruce.

Grandhomme has played strictly as a batsman so far in this series, and has scores of 0 and 3 in the first two games.

New Zealand are not too worried about their bowling performances in this series, despite India’s relative ease in chasing down totals in the first two matches. Their greater worry is contending with the Indian bowling, in particular Jasprit Bumrah who has regained much of his pre-injury rhythm.

In both matches, they were unable to get him away, whether at the start or during the death overs. For their part, India mixed things up well in the second T20, holding Bumrah back until later in the power play.

New Zealand have had a poor run at Eden Park off late, but their record at Seddon Park holds in good stead. They have won seven out of nine T20Is played here, and will be hoping to stop India from taking an unassailable lead in the series.

276,2020/01/28,"We miss Dhoni, no one sits on his seat in team bus: Chahal on video","No one sits on the seat that Mahendra Singh Dhoni made his own in the team bus, revealed India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, saying that the talismanic former skipper is missed by the side.

In a video shot inside the team bus while it was on its way to Hamilton for the third T20 International against New Zealand, Chahal is seen talking to several members of the squad including Jasprit Bumrah, Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul.

Towards the end of the video, he moved to the rear of the bus and pointed to an empty seat which, he said, was the former captain’s preferred spot before he went on a sabbatical last year.

“Yeh woh seat hai jahan ek legend baithate the. Mahi bhai. Abhi bhi yaha koi nahi baithata. Hum unhe bohot miss karte hai (This is the seat that used to be occupied a legend. MS Dhoni. No one sits here now. We miss him a lot),” Chahal said in the video posted on ‘bcci.tv’.

The-38-year-old Dhoni has not played a competitive game since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand on July 9. Earlier this month, Dhoni was dropped from the BCCI’s list of centrally contracted players, raising fresh doubts on his future.

However, on the same day Dhoni returned to training, batting fluently in the Jharkhand team nets.

Head coach Ravi Shastri has hinted that the celebrated wicketkeeper-batsman might retire from ODIs soon but will be in contention for a T20 World Cup berth provided he does well for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL.

277,2020/01/28,U-19 World Cup | A battle of wrist spinners,"Indian wrist spinner Ravi Bishnoi’s repertoire of skills will meet a match in Australian Tanveer Sangha’s variations in a face-off between two talented tweakers during the quarterfinals of the ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup here on Tuesday.

White ball cricket in recent times has seen wrist spinners emerge as an important cog and the junior category is no different where Bishnoi, easily the tournament’s most impactful bowler, would like to give his team the advantage over Australia. With 10 wickets from three matches, including a game-changing 4/30 against a gritty New Zealand, Bishnoi has proved why Kings XI Punjab has invested ₹2 crore on him in the IPL auction.

Even Sangha has been at his best with a haul of 10 wickets, including a spell of 5/14 against Nigeria. But there’s been a four-wicket haul against the West Indies and a wicket to show against England for the player of Indian origin.

On Tuesday, both wrist spinners will be the key to their team’s chances and Australia will look to improve its dismal record against India at the junior level.

In the last five U-19 encounters since 2013 (different teams have played though), India has won four matches with one game being abandoned due to rain.

Way ahead

As a team India is way ahead, both in terms of quality as well as temperament, with the likes of Yashasvi Jaiswal (two half-centuries), opening partner Divyansh Saxena and skipper Priyam Garg showing glimpses of their talent.

In bowling, lanky U.P. boy Kartik Tyagi, who breaches the 140kmph barrier quite regularly, and left-arm seamer Akash Singh, moving the white ball back into the right-handers, are a heady combination.

And there is left-arm spinner Atharva Ankolekar, who came back brilliantly against the Junior Black Caps despite being attacked early on. He got three crucial breakthroughs. However, a finger fracture in his right hand could be an impediment while fielding.

Tough customer

While Jaiswal, Garg, Thakur Tilak Verma and Saxena make India’s batting look strong, Australia skipper Mckenzie Harvey is a tough customer with the bat as he showed with an innings of 65 against England in its final group game.

Then there is Conor Sully, who bowls brisk medium pace and also has the ability to use the long handle to good effect.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/s5h1qw/article30668800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28GARG,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/u-19-world-cup-a-battle-of-wrist-spinners/article30668801.ece

According to sources, the Governing Council, at its meeting here on Monday, decided to reduce the number of matches starting at 4 p.m. to six. The idea is to protect the players and the spectators from extremely warm conditions in some parts of the country.

The Governing Council also decided to stick to 8 p.m. as the starting time for the IPL matches against the suggestion to commence at 7.30 p.m.

A suggestion was also mooted to increase the number of teams from three to four in the women’s section of the IPL.

He took some photos at the Eden before visiting other parts of the city where the game has a distinct presence.

Waugh, who supports Udayan Children’s Home here, has a strong connection with the city.

280,2020/01/28,Bankers meet CM to fund govt. housing projects,"In a bid to infuse money into government housing projects in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad on Monday held a meeting with representatives of top banks. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar also attended.

The meeting was in continuation with the State government’s plan to invite financial institutions to help the struggling real estate industry by promoting government projects.

“We are not aiming at a particular real estate project at this moment. This is an attempt to create a consensus among the banks to get ready with their finances. We are asking banks to invest in government housing projects with fixed returns,” Mr. Awhad said.

The meeting was attended by representatives of the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Central Bank of India, and Union Bank of India. Two weeks ago, in a review meeting of the housing department, Mr. Thackeray too had said that the thriving real estate industry would help revive economy.

Mr. Awhad on Friday had said that he had been pushing the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) to develop the land bank available with it on its own instead of asking builders to do so and allow them to benefit. “The real estate industry needs to be promoted and infused with money to complete housing projects. For any economy to thrive and grow, the real estate industry has to be powerful and in working condition. The government has been reviewing the sector since it was formed, and it has been found that it needs a financial push,” the minister had said.

“Instead of private builders, let the MHADA earn money by constructing houses. It is already in profit and coming more money to the MHADA would mean it can help the government in more ways financially,” he had said, adding a study group had been set up to find out various methods to do so and a report would soon be available.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/ptq3ft/article30669755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/bankers-meet-cm-to-fund-govt-housing-projects/article30669732.ece

When one clicks on the only video on the home page, the AAP chief walks to a door and rings the door bell and he says in a pre-recorded message, “Namaskar, mein Arvind Kejriwal hum. Andar aa sakta hum. Aap busy to nehi he.”

If the viewer presses a “welcome” option that appears on the screen, then another video of Mr. Kejriwal talking to the viewer from inside a house starts playing.

“Give a miss call on 7690944444 and you will find me at your door step,” Mr. Kejriwal said at an event at the launch of the website. A link to the website will be send to the mobile phone, if a person gives a miss call to the number.

“Delhi is a city of two crore people and approximately 50 lakh families. I wanted to visit every household and meet all the family members personally through door-to-door campaign. But it is not physically possible to visit each of the 50 lakh households in Delhi,” he said at the launch. Mr. Kejriwal said he wanted to have a direct conversation with the people without any mediators and this idea led to the launch of the website.

“This technology is used in games and high-end advertisements. The complete idea was developed by our team and it was made by an outside vendor. Though the technology existed, it was never for political campaigns at this scale by anyone before,” Ankit Lal, AAP’s social media head told The Hindu.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lf45nh/article30670267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL28-KEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-launches-website-to-connect-with-people/article30670268.ece
287,2020/01/28,"‘My bill is not zero, but AAP should come back’","As AAP Kalkaji candidate Atishi walked through the narrow lanes of Govindpuri on Monday evening, she smiled, waved, hugged people and asked for votes.

When asked what she is promising to the people, Ms. Atishi told The Hindu, “The promise we are giving is the continuation of the last five years. In the last five years, people have seen drastic changes in their lives be it electricity, water, school, free bus rides and free medicines. People really want to see a continuation of that.”

After she left the area, the opinion on the ground was divided mainly into two groups: The ones who enjoyed the benefits of multiple waiver schemes of the government and “improvement” in government schools and hospitals and the people who did not directly benefit from these.

Voices from ground

Ms. Atishi had hugged Shakuntla Devi, 50, at gali number 9 and asked her vote. “I will vote for Kejriwal. Our electricity bill is zero and water is also free,” Ms. Devi told The Hindu. She said that they have done a lot of work.

“Hume kya mila he? (What did we get?),” asked Mahesh Kumar, 50, who runs Khurana Thread House at gali number 10. “All the free schemes are for the poor people. We did not get anything,” Mr. Kumar said.

He said that he had heard that the government schools and hospitals have become better, but his children are not studying in government schools and the family do not go to government hospitals. “But there is chance that he [Kejriwal] could still win,” he added.

Parvez Aktar, 43, a customer at the shop, who does embroidery work, is a staunch supporter of AAP. “My 14-year-old daughter studies in Class IX at a government school which has improved a lot in terms of infrastructure and quality of education. Even teachers have become more sincere and they have even made a WhatsApp group of parents to send updates about the children and their homeworks.”

The contrast couldn’t be more stark than at Laxman Khanna’s general store. “The electricity bill has not reduced and I am paying for water also. If they are giving things for free, the money comes from the tax we pay. They have not done anything. I will vote for the BJP,” Mr. Khanna said sitting behind the counter of the shop.

Sitting near the step of the shop, 60-year-old Keval Sahani, who had come to the shop with his grandson, had a completely different opinion. “I will vote for Kejriwal. Our electricity bill has come down and water is free. He has worked for us,” Mr. Sahani said.

Amarjeet Kaur, 52, who works as a supervisor at her uncle’s company and owns a house in the area said: “Our electricity bill is not zero and my children are studying in government schools. They [AAP] have done work. They should come back to power,” she said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6ah6ks/article30670257.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL28-ATISHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/my-bill-is-not-zero-but-aap-should-come-back/article30670258.ece
288,2020/01/28,Oppn. could not protect or develop country: Shah,"Union Home Minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah while taking part in two public meetings in support of party’s Rithala and Janakpuri candidates, Manish Chaudhary and Ashish Sood respectively, accused Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of “changing” after coming to power on the back of the Anna movement.

“Kejriwal came to power with the help of Anna Andolan but completely changed later on. He had said that he will not take any government accommodation or vehicles and other facilities but after becoming Chief Minister, he availed all these facilities,” Mr. Shah said. He alleged that Opposition parties could neither protect the country nor develop it.

“The Congress kept many issues pending for 70 years but the Modi government solved them, be it the abolition of Article 370 and 35A, paved the way for the construction of Ram Temple. The team of Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal, Mamta Banerjee and Stalin indulge in politics on the issues of national interest for vote bank,” he alleged.

Meanwhile, BJP national president Jagat Prakash Nadda while addressing public meetings alleged that wherever riots and arson had taken place in the country, the Opposition had played “a special role”.

“Congress and Aam Aadmi Party are provoking people. Wherever there have been riots and arson in the country, some special people of the Opposition have played a role and these people are inciting people by sitting in Shaheen Bagh,” he alleged.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/oppn-could-not-protect-or-develop-country-shah/article30670222.ece
289,2020/01/28,Plea on untreated sewage water: NGT warns of action,"Following a plea seeking remedial action against the discharge of untreated sewage water which was causing groundwater contamination in Faridabad, the NGT has warned of coercive action against senior officials.

Taking note of a status report by authorities, a Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “The report shows equal lack of concern on the part of the authorities dealing with the situation. Contrary to the earlier directions, instead of taking immediate action, long term plan is being proposed with no concern for the immediate remedial measures.”

“No information has been furnished as to how the sludge is being remediated and why immediate steps, at least by way of phyto-remediation or bio-remediation are not being initiated,” it said. This exposes the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad and its officers to liability for action in terms of the prosecution of the Chief Executive Officer and recovery of compensation for the damage, apart from fixing personal responsibility of the erring officers by way of entry in ACRs and recovery from the salaries.”

The Bench said, “We give a last opportunity to take responsibility and tangible action after preparing an appropriate action plan within one month. The action may be overseen by the committee headed by Justice Pritam Pal, former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court.”

The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by Awasiya Jan Kalyan Samiti that alleged that the untreated sewage being discharged was adversely affecting public health in Faridabad.

An action-taken report dated January 2019 had said that due to choked sewer lines in Sector 48 and 49, there was an overflow of sewer and that no adequate remedial measures were taken by the authorities. Following observations, the Tribunal had directed the State government to take action and furnish an action-taken report.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/plea-on-untreated-sewage-water-ngt-warns-of-action/article30670202.ece

291,2020/01/28,HC declines plea against notification on free bus rides,"The Delhi High Court on Monday refused to entertain a plea challenging the notification providing free travel for women on buses operated by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) in the Capital.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar court observed that if women were allowed to travel free in cluster buses without a notification, then such action would be “bad”. It, however, made it clear that the action would not make the notification illegal. “The notification does not say the scheme is applicable on cluster buses... It does not talk of cluster buses. If they [Delhi government] have made it applicable on cluster buses, then the notification is not bad, their action is,” the High Court said.

“Then you challenge that before a single judge. File a better petition,” the High Court told the lawyer appearing for the petitioner organisations which represent small-time public transport operators who run mini buses, ‘gramin sewa’, ‘phat phat sewa’ and rural transport vehicles.

The lawyer for the petitioner organisations sought permission to withdraw the plea. The High Court granted the permission and said, “Dismissed as withdrawn”.

The plea challenged the Delhi government’s October 28, 2019 notification by which a provision was added in the Delhi Transport Corporation (Free and Concessional Passes) Regulation of 1985 to make travel free for women on DTC buses.

It contended that the scheme and the regulation were contrary to the Motor Vehicle Act and impermissible under the Constitution. It also argued that due to free travel for women on DTC and cluster buses, smal-time operators were getting fewer passengers making their respective businesses financially unviable.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-declines-plea-against-notification-on-free-bus-rides/article30670184.ece

Justice A.K. Chawla also issued notices to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), University Grants Commission and its V-C Najma Akhtar, on the plea.

The petition by M. Ehtesham-ul-Haque, a JMI alumnus, has alleged that Ms. Akhtar’s appointment was invalid for the reasons that the search committee, which selected prospective candidates for the post, was constituted illegally and that she had been denied CVC clearance initially.

The petition, filed through advocate Mobashshir Sarwar, claimed that the denial of clearance was revoked after intervention of the Ministry of Human Resource Development.

“It is submitted that the entire process culminating into the impugned appointment of Najma Akhtar is a colourable exercise of power and in flagrant violation and total non-compliance of the statutory provisions of the Jamia Millia Islamia Act, 1988,” it claimed.

293,2020/01/28,"SDM, policemen injured as farmers hurl stones in Jewar","A Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) and several policemen were injured as farmers threw stones at them in Gautambuddha Nagar’s Jewar on Monday. The incident happened in Rohi village where the officials had gone to acquire the last pocket of land for the upcoming Jewar International Airport.

The farmers, alleging unfair treatment by the U.P. government, were demanding better compensation for their land.

Sources said that when the police tried to move them from the protest site and tried to put them into a private bus, farmers resorted to stone pelting, leaving at least four policemen and SDM (Jewar) Gunja Singh, injured. They shouted slogans against the government and vandalised half-a-dozen vehicles.

“Some farmers have been protesting at Dayanatpur village for the last five months under the banner of Jewar Airport Kisan Sangharsh Samiti. Today, they shifted to Junior High School of Rohi village as the District Magistrate was scheduled to transfer the last parcel of land to Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA),” said a local source, requesting anonymity.

“The farmers are demanding four times the circle rate, while the government has offered twice the circle rate. Some of their petitions have been rejected by the Allahabad High Court, while some are still pending,” he said, adding the protesters are on the run after the incident.

Playing down the incident, District Magistrate B.N. Singh said necessary legal action would be taken. “Some disgruntled elements who are already contesting their case in the Allahabad High Court, and were not the owners of land to be transferred, resorted to stone-pelting.” “The SDM was hurt, but then all the villagers came and the transfer took place peacefully,” he added.

Mr. Singh further said that the district administration had transferred the last parcel of land for Jewar International Airport to Yamuna Authority. “In total, 1,334 hectares of land has been transferred in the first phase. In the last seven months, the farmers have been paid ₹3,000 crore.

In addition, it said that students registering between January 24 and February 3 will not be charged the revised hostel rent.

The High Court, in an order on January 24, had provided relief to the students of JNU who have been on strike since October 28 against a hike in hostel fees and asked the university to register students for the new academic session as per the old hostel manual.

300,2020/01/28,‘Kejriwal Brigade worked underground for two months after Lok Sabha failure’,"The most important challenge for the Aam Aadmi Party and the people of Delhi right now is to form an AAP government in the city. It is necessary for the Constitution, democracy, and humanity, said Minister and member of AAP’s Political Affairs Committee Gopal Rai during a recent interview. Excerpts:

What are the issues in your constituency Babarpur?

Mostly BJP candidates have won from Babarpur in the past and due to their politics of Hindu-Muslim polarisation, the area slowly went backwards. In the last five years we worked on basic facilities and we have solved 90% of the problems. We have developed roads and mohalla clinics.

What are the promises you are making to people of Babarpur for the next five years?

Now we are going towards different projects. We have passed a project for a 100-bed hospital and land has been identified. We are also working to construct a mini-stadium, an auditorium, and a new school.

You were the party in-charge during the Lok Sabha election and AAP did not win any seat. What has the party done differently since then?

At the time of the Lok Sabha election we were not weak at the organisation level. We did a strong campaign but the situation was very different. Within a month of the general election, we made direct connect with the public at the booth level. We did underground work for two months without any publicity. No one knew what we were doing. We asked people what were they thinking. And after that we released the first slogan — Dilli mein toh Kejriwal. It came from the people. AAP candidates are going to win with a greater majority this time.

Could you tell us more about the work done in those two months?

We had made a ‘Kejriwal Brigade’ and appointed 1,200 people to get feedback from the voters. That information has helped us.

Many leaders who joined the party recently have been given tickets, while some sitting MLAs and party leaders have been overlooked. Do you think this will affect the cadre morale?

We have done this for only five-six seats. When we took feedback and did surveys, the names of the politicians we have given tickets to came up as popular leaders in the area. We approached these leaders, and those who were ready to join us were given a chance to contest on AAP ticket.

What are the challenges that the party is facing this time?

The BJP does not have any leadership and they are trying to polarise this election along communal lines. The people are apprehensive that the BJP might do something right before the elections.

Why is AAP not protesting on the ground against the citizenship law or violence in JNU and Jamia?

The most important challenge for AAP and the people of Delhi right now is to form an AAP government. It is necessary for the Constitution, democracy, and humanity. And we are fighting for it. If a BJP government is formed, then for five years no work will happen. So, we are fighting a real democratic battle and going forward with this challenge is priority. I think that the first challenge for the people of Delhi is February 8.

Mr. Kejriwal did not meet the victims of JNU violence. Does AAP feel that there will be a backlash if it supports CAA, NRC and JNU?

The party is focusing on the Assembly elections. We are putting our full energy in it. I feel that right now, more than going to any protest, the more important thing is to stop a government that has an undemocratic thought process from entering Delhi.

What is AAP’s plan after the elections? Does it want to concentrate on Delhi or revive its national dreams?

The work will be done in two parts. The AAP government will focus on development work in Delhi. And the party will focus on spreading AAP nationwide.

You are a member of the Political Affairs Committee, the highest decision-making body of AAP. Why have so many founding members of the party left?

They tried to analyse things from a short-term view. They were hasty. When things are complex, you feel that what you are thinking is the truth, but that is not the reality and it requires time to understand that. We have fulfilled the commitment with which we came to power. I feel that they all [founding members] took their decisions very hastily. Change and revolution will not happen in a short time. There will be a lot of ups and downs. It requires time.

How has AAP changed since it was formed nine years ago?

There has not been much change. Earlier, volunteers had to go and campaign. Now people campaign for us. Earlier, we had to go and make the people understand, as the party was new, now people have understood us. Now, the rickshaw-pullers, street vendors and even the students of government schools are our spokespersons.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4j4sxj/article30670014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GOPALRAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-brigade-worked-underground-for-two-months-after-lok-sabha-failure/article30670015.ece

303,2020/01/28,‘Shaheen Bagh protest is a platform for tukde-tukde gang’,"Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday alleged that the Shaheen Bagh protest is “a textbook case of a few hundred people trying to suppress the silent majority” and is offering a platform to the “tukde-tukde gang” under the guise of opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

He claimed that those trying to divide India are getting cover at Shaheen Bagh protest where Tricolours are being waived.

“It is offering a platform to tukde-tukde gang elements under the garb of opposition to the CAA. This protest is not just a protest against the CAA, it is a protest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Mr. Prasad said during a press conference.

Mr. Prasad’s comments echoed a series of tweets by BJP chief J.P. Nadda who questioned the AAP government’s tardiness in giving sanction for prosecution of cases against former JNU Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar and others. Mr. Nadda also said that the AAP government was part of the “tukde-tukde gang”.

Mr. Prasad accused both AAP and the Congress of vote-bank politics.

“It is important to bring the truth out. Rahul Gandhi went to JNU when the tukde-tukde gang was raising slogans to divide India. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal also went there. This is their truth and it is only for vote bank.”

He alleged that lakhs of commuters are in distress as they cannot go to their workplace. Shops are also being shut and children are unable to go to school due to the “roadblock by Shaheen Bagh protesters”.

‘Silent voices’

He further asked why Mr. Kejriwal and AAP leader Manish Sisodia were not listening to the “silent” voices of those distressed by the road blockade.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ud7qpf/article30669877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27RAVI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shaheen-bagh-protest-is-a-platform-for-tukde-tukde-gang/article30669878.ece
304,2020/01/28,Youth beaten up for raising anti-CAA slogans at Shah’s meeting,"A youth was allegedly thrashed by the crowd for raising slogans against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act during BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s public meeting in the Babarpur Assembly constituency on Sunday evening.

As the meeting was under way, the youth stood up and started raising slogans against the Act. Angered by this, the public started beating him up. Seeing the commotion, Mr. Shah intervened and asked the security personnel to rescue him.

In a video of the incident posted on social media, a youth is seen being attacked with chairs. Later, Mr. Shah is seen appealing to his security persons to intervene and save him from the crowd.

A senior police officer said the youth was handed over to the police. He did not have any identity proof, but later gave his house address.

Handed over to parents

The police informed his parents and he was handed over to them after verification. No further action had been taken against him, the police officer said.

The police said the youth is a student of Delhi University’s School of Open Learning.

305,2020/01/28,Come and meet us: Shaheen Bagh women to Central govt.,"Despite remarks made by political leaders on the Shaheen Bagh protest, the women at the sit-in – who have been the focal point of the resistance against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens (NRC) – remained unperturbed on Monday and continued with their demand that the law be revoked.

Reacting to comments made by Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, a protester from Lucknow, Sumaiya Rana, said: “Political parties are doing their job while we are doing our job, which is to save our country and uphold the Constitution.”

Stating that residents of the locality “have lived in harmony for ages”, 62-year-old Taslima said: “Why are they creating unnecessary divides between people? Every day there is one statement or the other. Why doesn’t anyone from the Central government come and meet us instead?”

Ghaziabad resident Uzma, 23, said: “Every woman here has the same question, why are the leaders not coming to meet us? They can give whatever justification they have behind bringing in such a kaala kanoon [black law]. If PM Narendra Modi thinks that the government has done something legitimate and relevant then why are they scared to face us?”

While the evening proceeded with the usual performances and public addresses, constant appeals were made to the speakers to “restrict” their content to the CAA and the NRC, so that Shaheen Bagh’s maryaada (dignity) is maintained and the narrative does not get diverted. Commenting on the references made to tukde-tukde gang by some political leaders to describe the sit-in, which is now over 40 days, Gulbano, 51, said: “The ones who are using the term are the ones who want to divide the country. Hum yahan desh jodne ke liye aaye hain [We are here to integrate the country].”

Stating that the protest on the arterial road will continue unless the law is revoked, Nazneen from the area said: “Are we mad that we will be sitting here for so long? The government is complaining about the road blockade. But it will all end the moment they assure us and give it in writing that the law will be revoked. There is no confusion about that. So why can’t they speak to us about it?”

Reacting to slogans raised by Union Minister Anurag Thakur, 35-year-old Sayeeda said: “We do not want to speak in the same language. It is not what we stand for and we are not here to use such language against anyone. Our demand is still the same as it was when the sit-in began.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/85emrx/article30669865.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27SHAHEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/come-and-meet-us-shaheen-bagh-women-to-central-govt/article30669866.ece
306,2020/01/28,nCoV tests may be conducted in Hyderabad soon,"In about 10 days, tests for Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) may be conducted in Hyderabad.

A tweet from the official account of Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare stated that four labs of Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) Viral Research and Diagnostics Lab Network in four cities, including in Hyderabad, were activated to test samples. Currently, all samples are being sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for the tests.

There are three ICMR project facilities at Telangana — Gandhi Hospital, Osmania General Hospital (both in Hyderabad), and another in Warangal. Superintendent of Fever Hospital and director of Institute of Preventive Medicine, K. Shankar said that the one at Gandhi Hospital might be selected for the purpose in all probability. The laboratory would be checked and funds will be issued accordingly. If samples are tested in Hyderabad, it will save precious time taken to transport samples to the NIV.

Health Minister Eatala Rajender is scheduled to hold a meeting on Wednesday on the State’s preparedness to deal with nCoV.

Notified courier services

Swab samples collected from people admitted to the isolation ward of the Fever Hospital are sent to NIV in private vehicles, escorted by staff from Health Department. Dr Shankar said that they have another option to send the samples — through three courier services approved by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Officials reiterated that samples are collected from people who have travel history to China and experience symptoms such as cold, cough, breathlessness. Besides, if one is in close contact with a person who has returned from China, such as their spouse or parents, and experiences the symptoms, their samples will also be collected.

But if someone has only travel history and does not show any symptoms, they will be closely observed even if they are at home.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/p6ocoi/article30677991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28-CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ncov-tests-may-be-conducted-in-hyderabad-soon/article30677992.ece

The TRS had a strength of 14 councillors, Congress 4, BJP 1 while four independents also won in the 23-member municipality. The election was postponed to Tuesday due to some differences within the TRS over the chairperson’s nomination. Marri Rajashekar Reddy, incharge of Malkajgiri Parliamentary constituency, coordinated with the sulking aspirants and ensured the smooth election.

Mr. Reddy said people overwhelmingly voted for the leadership of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and the IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao.

308,2020/01/28,Five more samples from city to be tested for nCoV,"Five more people who recently travelled to China and showed symptoms of Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) were admitted to the isolation ward of Fever Hospital here on Tuesday.

Their swab samples will be sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, on Wednesday. Two samples which were sent in the past few days had tested negative. Officials said there is no positive case in Telangana or India so far.

The five new in-patients, who were admitted at the hospital, include three of a family (a married couple and their daughter). They returned from China to Hyderabad a week ago, and had mild cough and cold. They approached Fever Hospital doctors on Tuesday after getting to know about the isolation ward.

Besides them, two more people contacted the doctors and were admitted to the isolation ward on Tuesday evening. Samples collected from all five will be sent for tests.

The first person to get admitted at the ward and test negative for the nCoV was re-admitted on Monday as he experienced gastric problems. He was, however, discharged on Tuesday night.

Three days ago, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan urged people with travel history to China since January 1 this year to self-report to the nearest health facility if they have symptoms such as fever, cough and respiratory distress.

309,2020/01/28,Construction firms evading thousands of crores of building cess : CPI(M),"Communist Party of India (Marxist) has raised serious concerns about violation of the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess Act, 1996, according to which 1% cess should be deposited with the Labour Department on construction of every building with over ₹10 lakh outlay.

In a press conference on Tuesday, the party’s Greater Hyderabad Central City Committee secretary M. Srinivas and others alleged evasion of cess by the construction companies to the extent of thousands of crores of rupees, and demanded a white paper to be tabled on the amount of cess evaded since 2014. Welfare cess of ₹162 crore accruing from the construction of Hyderabad Metro Rail has not been paid so far. Receiving notices from the Labour Department, the concessionaire approached High Court and obtained stay order. Though five years have passed, no counter has been filed to get the stay vacated.

Though there are Supreme Court orders that a stay would stand automatically vacated after expiry of six months, the Labour Department has done precious little to recover the amount. Mr.Srinivas recalled the Delhi High Court judgement in 2011 that the cess must be paid by Delhi Metro Rail contractor, and demanded that the cess be recovered along with 2% penalty as per the Act.

During the the nine-month period between April and December last year, GHMC granted building permissions for a total of 16,789 structures, but welfare cess was paid only by 39 companies. In 2018, a total of 14,190 structures got permissions, as against the payment of cess only by 38 companies. A year before that, only six companies paid the cess against 8,704 structures given permission.

Though the State government directed the GHMC to charge the cess at the time of building permissions, the same is not being done. As per the alert notes sent by Vigilance to the Labour Department, ₹ 1,047 crore of cess has been evaded. Of this, only ₹89 crore has been recovered. Several notices sent to the builders in the purview of Rangareddy District Commissioner of Labour returned reportedly because the addresses were not found. Mr.Srinivas also alleged that the structures were not being assessed for their value, and even where cess is being paid, it is not scientifically calculated.

Even the cess paid is not being deposited with the Telangana Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board from the Pay & Accounts Department, he charged. Since 2014, the funds meant for welfare of the workers are being diverted by the government for other programmes, he said.

The ₹1,400 crore funds in the bank account of the Board at the time of State bifurcation have not been distributed between both the States, as both governments have entered into a dispute and shown no interest in resolving it.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sn0k2q/article30677934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29BILLDINGVARKARS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/construction-firms-evading-thousands-of-crores-of-building-cess-cpim/article30677935.ece
310,2020/01/28,"Old woman robbed, killed in Nedunur village","An octogenarian woman was found murdered outside her daughter’s house in Nedunur village at Kandukur mandal in Rangareddy district in the early hours of Tuesday. The police believe that robbery is the motive behind the murder as gold chains, ear studs and silver bangles were missing on her body.

According to Kandukur inspector E Jangaiah, the victim Sargari Balamani (80) was throttled to death by robbers when she came out in the dark to attend nature’s call. The house door was fastened with a latch from outside, and there were no traces of forceful entry inside, he said.

“After the robbery and murder, the accused, who are yet to be identified, placed Balamani’s body outside her daughter Marri Kalamma’s house, so as to put the blame on her,” Mr. Jangaiah said. The victim’s house is about 20 metres from her daughter’s house in the village.

He said that they found bruises and injuries on her body as the culprits forcefully removed the jewellery. “She was wearing at least six tolas of gold and 10 tolas of silver bangles,” the officer said.

The offence came to light around 4.30 a.m when Kalamma’s husband Marri Anji Reddy found her body lying in front of the gate.

311,2020/01/28,Vice-chairperson election put off in Nalgonda for lack of quorum,"The election for the post of vice-chairperson in Nalgonda municipality continued to be postponed for lack of quorum, for the second day on Tuesday.

Of the total 48 wards in the town, both Congress and TRS had won 20 wards each, the Bharatiya Janata Party bagged six wards, an independent candidate and another from the AIMIM secured one each.

The election of Chairman M. Saidi Reddy witnessed full house on Monday. The TRS leaders, including its five ex-officio members, left immediately after the voting. And the House was left with 20 Congress and six BJP members. According to officials, since the vote count of TRS rose to 27, including the support of AIMIM, an independent and ex-officio options, taking the full strength to 53, a quorum of 27 was required to conduct the vice-chairperson election.

Interestingly, a communication from BJP Nalgonda on Monday that its chairman candidate Bandaru Prasad would take oath as the vice-chairman sprang surprise and became instant talk of the town. The party remained silent on it after the TRS left with just the Chairperson election on Monday, and also remained absent on Tuesday. Congress leaders who addressed a press meet after the special meeting on Tuesday said it was not away from victory, gaining 20 wards like the TRS, but the party did not enter into an arrangement with BJP because it valued secular aspects. However, the secret pact between TRS and BJP, for sharing of chairperson and vice-chairperson seats, was out in the open for people to notice, they said.

“Nalgonda municipality is a great example of TRS and BJP’s secret relationship. Now, how will the TRS address its stand on BJP’s Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens?

313,2020/01/28,SBI directed to refund ₹6.41 lakh to NGO,"A consumer forum directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to refund ₹6.41 lakh and pay ₹50,000 as compensation for failing to furnish proof that it credited money to the Income Tax Department paid by an NGO.

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Hyderabad - I was dealing with a complaint filed by Aware (India) Foundation.

The NGO stated that in August 2004, it remitted ₹6.41 lakh as dues to the I-T Department. After completion of I-T assessment, the department in January 2013 issued orders that the NGO is entitled for a refund.

The NGO stated that the Assistant Director of Income Tax (Exemptions) – II wrote a letter to the bank in June 2012, which was then Bank of Saurashtra, and had not yet merged with SBI, directing it to upload the tax remittance form. He also informed the NGO that no response from the bank was forthcoming.

The forum noted that the onus of providing proof about the transfer of funds from the bank to the IT Department was on the former.

The respondents did not furnish documents relating to the funds transfer. The bank had also maintained that post-merger, records of State Bank of Saurashtra were not available.

Taking evidences on record, the forum directed the bank to refund ₹6.41 lakh and pay ₹50,000 compensation apart from ₹5,000 costs.

Faulty LED TV

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Hyderabad – II directed Bajaj Electronics, Toshiba India Pvt. Ltd. and its authorised service centre to refund the cost of an LED television, and pay ₹10,000 as compensation. The TV was not repaired despite being within the warranty period.

The forum was dealing with a complaint filed by M, Vishwanath, a lawyer and resident of RC Puram, who stated that he paid ₹26,020 for the TV and that after 15 months, it began to develop problems. He also stated that despite being within the warranty period of three years, the problem was not attended to.

For their part, Bajaj Electronics denied all allegations. The company also stated that it was only a dealer of Toshiba products and was not responsible for the product.

The other respondents were not present.

The forum, after taking all available evidence placed on record, stated that despite being issued a legal notice, the respondents did not reply. This, it noted, amounts to deficiency in service.

314,2020/01/28,Lessons in road safety to sensitise motorists,"Awareness about traffic rules and their enforcement was an ignored subject for several years in the rural areas of the State. But no more, as a Traffic Training Institute at Jagtial has transformed the scene.

Such is the awareness among locals that most of the two-wheeler riders are wearing helmets to ‘save their lives’. Traffic training institutes have been, for years, only operational in the limits of the three urban commissionerates — Hyderabad, Cyberabad, and Rachakonda, but Jagtial is now the first town in Telangana to boast of this facility.

Speaking to The Hindu, Jagtial Superintendent of Police Sindhu Sarma said they started the TTI in October last year as part of ongoing efforts to spread traffic awareness outside of the metropolis and curb road accidents in the district. “Most accidents happen on non-urban roads. However, we are making efforts to change all that now, with women’s safety and road safety both being the theme of 2020 for Telangana Police. The TTI will go a long way in making commuters aware of the dangers of reckless or careless driving,” she said.

When asked what made her start the institute, Ms. Sarma said that they analysed accident data of previous years and noticed that given proper orientation towards the importance of following road safety rules, a lot of fatalities could be reduced.

“Majority of the accidents are caused due to negligent or unsafe driving practices of the parties involved, at places where there are no engineering defects. So if we can get people to follow safe driving practices, there will be a reduction in road accidents,” she stated, adding that they have made enforcement and education their focus area.

Like in Hyderabad, even in Jagtial, people caught for drunk driving are given counselling at the TTI along with their family members. “Since its inception, a total of 975 people caught in drunk driving checks have attended the counselling sessions and we can proudly say there were no repeat offenders,” the officer said.

It is an educative process — Idea is to help people reflect on how unsafe it is to not follow road safety rules. They should go back feeling they have learnt something; not that they are being punished for doing something wrong.

Further, to create awareness among ‘young citizens’, the police invite schoolchildren to the institute and interact with them, focussing on the reduction of accidents in future. “Children feel very excited as we have interesting videos for them — of CCTV footages of accidents where wearing a helmet saved lives and videos explaining road signs,” Ms. Sarma said, adding that even on Monday, as part of Road Safety Week several schoolchildren visited the TTI.

“A riding simulator, miniature tracks and a Road Safety Quiz which pops ten random questions about road safety when we start quiz are the major attraction for children. So far, 3,450 students have experienced it, apart from 850 general public and drivers caught in various offences,” she added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/9q7en0/article30677712.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy27jagithayal1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lessons-in-road-safety-to-sensitise-motorists/article30677721.ece

317,2020/01/28,60% of arrests unnecessary or unjustified: NALSAR V-C,"The police do not have a right to make indiscriminate arrests and the Constitution of India denies them the power, said Faizan Mustafa, Vice-Chancellor, NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.

He was delivering the 24th memorial lecture of late IPS officer K.S. Vyas at RBVRR Telangana State Police Academy on ‘Constitution, Human Rights and Policing’ on Monday.

“You do not have the power to take away anybody’s life without the due process of law and one must read the fundamental rights chapter,” he said to the trainee sub-inspectors and other senior police officers present in the auditorium. In fact, the central function of a Constitution is to deny power to the State and since the police are the most direct expression of the State authority, “it denies you the power”.

Quoting police commissioned report, Mr. Mustafa said that 60% of the arrests made by the police in India are either unnecessary or unjustified, due to which 40.3% resources of the prisons are wasted. “Therefore be judicious when you are curtailing the freedom of people,” he said.

Earlier, in an indirect reference to the ongoing protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), Mr. Mustafa said that for the past one month, people across the country had embraced the Constitution and are reading the preamble. “I don’t know how many can understand it, but at least I see them reading. No other country anywhere in the world ever saw so many people reading the Constitution,” he stated. He maintained that it’s a bad time to talk to police officers, as he comes from a university. Students across various universities are unhappy about the excessive and disproportionate force that has been used in Delhi and by the Uttar Pradesh police in Aligarh recently.

He further stated that the nation is increasingly going in the direction of rule by law, instead of rule of law, which is a basic fundamental principle of our Republic. Mr. Mustafa warned the trainee SIs that they will be held liable for all illegal and unconstitutional acts which they do and said that he will sign a memorandum of understanding with the State police academy so that the trainees get a NALSAR diploma or a certificate or a degree for whatever training they want to appear.

Earlier, Director General of Police M Mahender Reddy said that K.S. Vyas inspired generations of police officers and youth in the society. He said that Vyas was a very renowned, committed, and genius police officer, who always thought out of the box for creating innovation and improvements in the existing system. “Today, if Andhra Pradesh and Telangana States are peaceful, it is because of the instruments created by Mr. Vyas, who has been in the forefront in fighting Naxalism and ensuring that the violence of Left wing extremist groups has come down,” he said.

According to Mr. Reddy, the Constitutional law and police work go hand in hand. “We are the agents of law. Whatever we think, do and aspire must be done in the provisions of law.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/f1dir5/article30672201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy27NALSAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/60-of-arrests-unnecessary-or-unjustified-nalsar-v-c/article30672202.ece

Asif, 30, was electrocuted when he came in contact with live wires set up by farmers in a field to trap wild boars. The incident took place at 1 a.m. on Monday morning, according to complainant Syed Sharif, father-in-law of the deceased.

The MPTC member had gone into the forest near Mamidigattu in Mandamarri mandal of Mancherial district, falling under Ramakrshnapur police station limits, to hunt rabbits on the previous night with three others. While returning, he accidentally tripped on the live wires in a field, allegedly set up by farmers Durgam Durgaiah and Nampally Rajaiah.

320,2020/01/28,The long road from wholesale to retail market,"The erstwhile malls of Hyderabad are now a pale shadow of their former selves. Yes, the Monda Market was a mall. “One row of shops was for meat, another for fish, the central quadrangle was for vegetables and the shops in the V-shaped area were grain shops,” says Jaiprakash, a third generation shopkeeper of Telukunta Rajaiah and Sons inside Monda Market.

A satellite image shows a massive rhombus shaped area of the covered market. “This open space used to be filled with bullock carts that used to bring grains and vegetables to the city from the surrounding areas. About 30 years ago, it began to change with more number of vehicles bringing in goods. Now all the four big entrances to the market have been closed and it is now a retail market,” says Mr. Jaiprakash, sitting inside the grain market.

The space where bullock carts used to be parked is now occupied by vegetable hawkers who keep up sing-song hollering of the prices.

Outside the grain shop, the hawkers, animals and buyers create a cacophony of sounds, smells, colours and sights in a buzz of activity. A few yards away is a covered meat market which is too odoriferous to enter. “There are 46 shops. Now only a few function from here as there is no business,” says a shopkeeper.

Small retail traders have taken away the business of the meat shops. A clear violation of the GHMC Act-1955: “no person, shall without a licence from the Commissioner, sell or expose for sale any four-footed animal or any meat or fish intended for human food, in any place other than a municipal or private market.”

Outside the building is a faint outline that reads ‘Meat Market 1878’. Hawkers in a parallel row of shops sell offal. They share space with potters. “These pots are used for weddings,” says a woman as she carefully colours a pot with radiant colours and intricate patterns. “From the ingredients used after the birth of a baby to the paraphernalia required for funeral rites, everything is available here,” says Qasim Ali, who hawks bangles inside the Monda Market.

Begum Bazar

A few miles away is Begum Bazar. “They have destroyed my vegetable shop. The fish market is being built but I don’t know the status of the vegetable market,” says Arutla Kishen, who has set up a tea stall just adjacent to the heap of tin sheets where his vegetable stall used to exist. A site map of the older shops shows a rectangular area with rows of shops with an ice factory in the rear.

“There were six sections — dry fish, vegetables, raw fish, offal, mutton and beef. The beef section was closed 15 years ago,” informs Kishen. It is the raw fish section with the dark black water flowing on the road that creates an unbearable stench. “If they clean the drains and the water flows into them, we will not have to bear the stench. We have become used to it and don’t realise it, but it is terrible for business,” says K. Yadagiri who has a shop that deals with wholesale plastic goods.

The fate of changing character of these two big vegetable shopping arcades is shared by the Mandi Mir Alam and the Old Sabzi Mandi. “These shops are empty. Business is down for the past few years. Earlier, this used to be cleaner but now it stays dirty through the day,” says Sajjad who carts vegetables in the Mandi Mir Alam. Near the entrance arch of the market is an inscription about ₹60,20,000 being earmarked for laying a reinforced concrete road and a pipeline. The condition of the market shows the state of execution of the project. And thereby hangs a tale.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/pudmyi/article30669406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/monda,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-long-road-from-wholesale-to-retail-market/article30669394.ece
321,2020/01/28,Weekly pop-up markets bring veggies to the doorsteps,"The archway that leads into Mandi Mir Alam market has an invocation in Arabic and no date of establishment of the market. A protective iron scaffolding has been erected to keep the arch in its place at a cost of ₹14 lakh. “This market was the biggest wholesale market in the city. It had five arches, now only one exists. Big vehicles cannot come inside (just like in the case of Monda Market). The Rythu Bazaars established during N. Chandrababu Naidu’s regime and smaller markets have destroyed the importance of this market. Now, this is just a small retail market,” says Shaikh Faqruddin, a vegetable commission agent, from his 70-year-old shop. He dates the market to 1788-89 when Mir Alam Bahadur was a trusted aide of Nizam Ali Khan during the Carnatic Wars.

The loss of importance of these big vegetable market has proved a boon for citizens of Hyderabad as weekend pop-up markets are the norm in most localities of the city. Narrow streets in densely populated residential areas suddenly turn into vegetable markets with hawkers setting up temporary shops right down to raised platforms and battery-powered LED lamps. Tarnaka, Hyderguda, Puppalguda, Nalanda Nagar, Shaikpet Nala and most other residential areas see these temporary weekend markets where families walk in with wheeled bags and cart the vegetables home.

“It is part of our Sunday routine. Many people of our apartment complex do the same; we go for shopping at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m., get fresh vegetables and are back within an hour with shopping done for the week. The best part is we don’t have to take out our vehicle for that,” says Sharmila Naidu, who lives in an apartment block in Nalanda Nagar. One family’s comfort factor is another businessman’s pain.

Inside the Gudimalkapur Market, shopping is a breeze as people ride their bikes inside, pick up their vegetables and zip away. “There are so many smaller markets that people don’t have to come here. Only if a market is crowded, there will be good business. When there is no crowding, you can assume business is failing,” says Chandrasekhar, a commission agent at the Gudimalkapur Market.

Ironically, Gudimalkapur vegetable market was a solution for crowding of the older Sabzi Mandi in Karwan area. “This market has now shrunk to a small streetside vegetable market. Many of the shop owners have sold them off and houses have come up in the area,” says Narayan Chari who has been running a grocery store for the past 40 years in the area.

Hunting ground for retailers

Sprawled over 23 acres and five guntas is the Dr B. R. Ambedkar Vegetable Market, better known as Bowenpally Market. “Most of the wholesale traders from Monda Market and other markets moved here when this was established in 2002. Every day, about 1,000 lorries bring vegetables from across the country to here,” informs T.N. Sreedhar Srinivas, chairman of the Market Committee.

It is this market that sends vegetables to all other markets in city and is the hunting ground for retailers trying to make a killing with price differential. “Carrots from Gujarat, onions from Maharashtra, tomatoes from Chittoor and potatoes from Madhya Pradesh are brought here and then dispersed across the region,” informs Mr. Srinivas.

The Bowenpally Market is the only one in the city which has a cold-storage warehouse. “We are working on a composting facility that will take care of 10 tonnes of organic waste generated here,” he says.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ieto4u/article30669389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/miralum,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/weekly-pop-up-markets-bring-veggies-to-the-doorsteps/article30669385.ece
322,2020/01/28,"If music be the food of love, play on","The closure of live music venues such as Bflat and The Humming Tree in Indiranagar, last year, disappointed musicians, but that did not keep them down for long. Intimate live music venues and studio spaces have held forth in Bengaluru’s music scene for four to five years — proof that the music will never die in Bengaluru. Young, enterprising artistes are doing their bit to keep the music scene alive as well.

22-year-old singer-songwriter Vishruti Bindal, for example, runs the company Natsukashii, which she started in March 2019. “Under this, I manage an array of artistes and plan shows/tours. The last was a 22-city tour with Abhi Tambe. I have also planned tours in Nepal and Sri Lanka with Beard of Harmony. I think intimate venues are the way forward.”

And that is why she started the Bengaluru chapter of House Concert in 2016. “Manu Mathew founded House Concert in Delhi in 2015. I followed suit. We organise gigs in unconventional spaces and houses. Our intention is to create artiste-centric spaces. We are registering House of Concert as a not-for-profit organisation because we are quite clear that we want to give back to the music community. All production costs go to the performers. In fact, I would call it a community-led initiative, it is not run by one person.”

Akshay Deokuliar aka DE•O, a musician, artist and creative entrepreneur based in Bengaluru, is the founder and head of independent label and media company RECK that run live properties including the sxene™ and LVNG, as well as manage artistes Taba Chake, Sabu and Micah.

DE•O says their office and headquarters, located in seventh block, Koramangala, has been an informal space for gigs. “One room is a professional studio,” he says, adding: “We also hold sessions in which we have a pre-release and the artistes talk about their album, before it is formally released.”

Apart from restaurants, musicians recommend intimate spaces. The Blue Room, a multi-art space, is quite sought after for live music performances. Vishruti speaks highly of the space. “It was started by Samhita Nagaraj three years ago, and their third anniversary was held on January 25 (Saturday). She converted the basement of her house into a performance space, which has been acoustically treated.”

Vishruti Bindal and Samhita Nagaraj

The Blue Match Box Studio was started by 28-year-old artist Kehaan J Saraiya a year and a half ago. “It is a studio-and-gallery space, where we also host music gigs, which is mostly jazz and blues.” The name ‘Blue Match Box’ comes from Kehaan’s Blues band by the same name.

Sid Do, (fashion stylist) and Praveen Muniyappa (a fashion photographer), a couple, started Studio C9 three years ago. “Studio C9 is primarily created for photo shoot needs but we have extended the use of our space for other creative ventures such as music, theatre, art/photography exhibitions , seminars, yoga classes and themed parties,” says Praveen. Gigs are held at their terrace.

A die-hard music enthusiast, who is a regular at gigs, Nix started an instagram music promoter page FamItsNix. In it Nix promotes gigs across the country. Nix was in Bengaluru and worked with RECK. Nix says: “It is a challenge to organise house gigs because of financial considerations and logistics such as acoustics. People prefer more established spaces like The Blue Room.”

Prarthana Sen, who brought Sofar Sounds — a global community of artistes, fans and hosts, to India in 2015 says, “Our first gig was held in Bangalore.” Prarthana says the closure of live music venues was a big blow to the music community.

“Sofar was operating before they closed down.” She, however, adds that there has not been a “dramatic” increase in the demand for gigs in intimate spaces.

When asked the challenges Bengaluru musicians face, Prarthana says: “The lack of venues and the legal support system of continuing growing them. A lot of people are moving to other cities Delhi and Pune because of this.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/27weh3/article30672630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bgmvishruti2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/if-music-be-the-food-of-love-play-on/article30672631.ece

According to the police, the accused confessed to 10 thefts in Alappuzha, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Idukki, and Kollam districts over the past couple of months. The duo acquainted themselves while serving prison terms together in previous cases. They hatched the chain snatching plans while behind the bars and executed them on being released.

The service is being operated since 2018 by the Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC). Failing to see eye-to-eye over some matters, the corporation and KSINC have not yet inked a formal agreement.

“A request will be placed before the KSINC to continue services till the SPV is formed,” Mayor Soumini Jain said at the council meeting on Tuesday. The council had passed a resolution earlier requesting the Government for approval to constitute the SPV.

329,2020/01/28,A story of struggles for equality,"His quest for justice started as a schoolboy and now, at the age of 82, M.K. Kunjol’s life is a story of struggles that he led for equality in society.

He has been conferred with the Padma Shri for social work this year — a recognition for his struggles to ensure justice for Dalits and his fights against police atrocities on them. He has been instrumental in making the works of B.R. Ambedkar and Ayyankali popular among the masses. He was honoured by the State government with the first Ambedkar award recently.

Kunjol’s wife continues to work as a daily wage labourer. Despite his family, including six children, struggling to make ends meet, Kunjol continues his fights for the marginalised. “Until there is a reasonable achievement for Dalits in the areas of education and jobs, the social development index does not make any sense,” says Mr. Kunjol who joined MBBS after graduating in science from Maharaja’s College, but could not complete the course because of various reasons.

Though he was in the midst of many student struggles and politics, he had never joined a party. He chose to fight elections on his own and became a popular orator.

Now, he is the patron of Kerala State Harjan Samajam that he had co-founded, Federation of SC and ST and the Hindu Aikya Vedi. He was instrumental in founding the Harijan Samajam Sri Budha Charitable Trust.

Mr. Kunjol feels that reservation for Dalits, which has brought over a hundred Dalit members to Parliament this time, has not made a difference in the life of the community. “Who stopped them from taking up the cause of Dalits?,” he asks.

Along with his fight for social justice, he has made a spiritual journey too from childhood. He believes his exposure to science has helped him decipher more in the matters of body and mind.

Born into a family of six siblings to Vallothi and Kurumban near Perumbavoor, Kuruppampady, in Rayamangalam panchayat, Mr. Kunjol feels that despite the implementation of land reforms in the State, there are lakhs of people who are landless. The two political fronts, which had led the governments in the State, have not done justice to such people, he says.

His own house is situated on a Government land for which he has no ownership rights. “Why did not the Government follow the 15-acre cap for individual land holdings, which is at the heart of land reforms Act,” he asks.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/sie9b7/article30676577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20200128132821,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-story-of-struggles-for-equality/article30676578.ece
330,2020/01/28,SHOs to lend an ear to senior citizens’ concerns,"Station House Officers (SHOs) in the district Rural Police limits may soon don the role of sounding boards for senior citizens to air their concerns.

A decision to organise frequent interactions with senior citizens at the local police station levels was one of the outcomes of an interaction that District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik had with nearly 100 senior citizens at the district police headquarters on Republic Day.

“We have decided to organise interactive sessions between senior citizens and SHOs of the respective areas on a monthly basis. Besides, they will also get to interact with the District Police Chief at least once in a quarter,” Mr. Karthik told The Hindu.

He said such an arrangement would instil confidence among senior citizens while also enabling the police to tend to their emergency requirements even if it went beyond the regular policing job. It would also be instrumental in furthering public-police participation, said Mr. Karthik.

The meeting witnessed elderly people talking about many issues they faced on a daily basis. Many lamented how they were made to stand in modes of public transport and how some autorickshaw drivers rudely turned down their requests to wait during the course of a trip. “Humanitarian considerations call for the timely redressing of these issues. We will bring these matters to the notice of the Motor Vehicles Department,” said Mr. Karthik.

M.R. Madhubabu, nodal officer for Janamaithri Police, Ernakulam Rural, said the participants also complained about being ignored at most places and by the younger generation.

“We are also planning legal awareness classes for the senior citizens to educated them about their rights. We will also organise more such interactive sessions to bring them to the mainstream and utilise their expertise and experience for constructive purposes while enhancing their self esteem,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/shos-to-lend-an-ear-to-senior-citizens-concerns/article30670092.ece
331,2020/01/28,"Crop raids by elephants, boars make life tough for farmers","Farmers living close to the forests at Panankuzhi and Kodanad, near Perumbavoor, are an exasperated lot with wild elephants and boars regularly raiding their land, mostly looking for food.

Troubles caused by wild animals have persisted over the last year, but it has grown more serious and frequent of late, says John K. Jacob, a farmer, who has lost pineapple, tapioca, banana and coconut crops to elephant and boar attacks recently.

Living close to Panankuzhi may look romantic to outsiders and tourists, but it is a dangerous game for farmers, says he, pointing to pineapple plants uprooted by elephants and tuber crops targeted by wild boars.

On most days, the animals appear close to farmlands about 6 p.m. on the lower reaches of the Periyar, waiting for dusk to set in and then begin raiding crops by about 8 p.m. They continue to stay on the farmlands during the night, retreating only with the morning light, he says. The recent appearance of a rogue tusker has also increased fears, he adds.

The Department of Forests is looking to erect electric fencing powered by solar energy as a solution. Work on 5-km of solar fencing will begin soon as an agreement has been signed with a contracting company, says an official. However, both farmers and people’s representatives had pointed out their inefficiency in preventing or even containing frequent attacks from wild animals. Mr. John says while electric fencing is helpful, most of them are not maintained properly and, as a result, the fences are destroyed by the elephants.

M.P. Prakash, member of Koovappady block panchayat and welfare standing committee chairman, says electric fencing will only be a partial solution to the problem. It is time for the Forest Department to consider brining back Neelakandan, a kumki elephant that was taken away from Kodanad elephant kral and sent to Wayanad for training. Neelakandan can be brought back and used to chase away the present set of wild elephants, he adds.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/crop-raids-by-elephants-boars-make-life-tough-for-farmers/article30670088.ece
332,2020/01/28,E-governance remains a non-starter in city,"While the State government had set a six-month deadline in late July last for the Kochi Corporation to make all e-governance facilities available, no progress has been made in that direction though the deadline is around the corner.

The minutes of a meeting convened by A. C. Moideen, Minister for Local Self-Government, with corporation officials and representatives of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) in July last have remained incomplete for the past six months, resulting in the delay.

It was decided at the meeting to quantify the work that TCS had completed and to identify whatever was still to be integrated into the e-governance system. For this, two TCS officials were to be appointed and their salaries footed by the corporation. But this crucial point was left out of the minutes.

The company’s contract had expired in 2017, after which it was given an extension for a year to complete the work. After the extension expired, the company provided marginal support as agreed to in the contract till February 2019, and then withdrew its officials from the corporation. Without a continuing contract, the appointments of officials could be made only on the basis of the minutes of the meeting and TCS had asked for the decision to be included in the minutes, a corporation official said.

“The corporation had agreed to pay the salaries of the two TCS officials and a decision to pay an amount less than ₹50,000 was decided at the meeting,” Mayor Soumini Jain said. “Soon after the meeting, we had sent a letter to the Minister and the Additional Chief Secretary to include these details in the minutes but have received no response yet,” she said.

The last letters addressed to the Minister and the Additional Chief Secretary with regard to e-governance were sent in November last. An earlier request to the Government was sent in September, said an official.

Additional Chief Secretary T. K. Jose said that he had not yet received a letter to include the decision in the minutes. According to a senior corporation official, the communication may not have reached its intended recipient.

Only when the TCS officials are appointed can a new work order be issued to the company. The registration of birth, death and marriage, town hall bookings, grievance applications and the corporation’s online portal have been prepared and are available online, but are of little use until existing data is merged with the system.

Software updation

“Since the software was developed in 2011, some updation is required. Further, the Information Kerala Mission (IKM) had digitised records at the corporation till 2015,” said the official. “The data available with IKM has not been entirely merged with the data TCS began to handle from 2015 onwards. Data from a few years prior to 2015 is not available to us yet. This means that making corrections in birth or other certificates prepared before 2015 is difficult”.

While births, deaths and marriages can be registered online, a certificate with the registrar’s signature cannot be downloaded as digital signatures are not available. Still, certificates have to be obtained from the corporation office, where long queues persist.

The company claims to have prepared all 22 modules they were supposed to offer, but modules like the property and professional taxes, and trade licence issuance are not available online yet, the official said.

As per the decision taken at the meeting, the corporation has appointed an IT officer and hardware network officer who took charge in November last. However, they are largely helpless, till TCS steps in to release the remaining modules and fix the glitches in the existing ones.

A report prepared by the IT officer on the technical and hardware issues that the e-governance system is currently facing is likely to be addressed at the next council meeting.

339,2020/01/28,Ready for talks with PM if CAA is repealed: Mamata,"Amidst continuing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday said she was “ready to talk” with the Prime Minister, if the law was “repealed.”

“It is good, if he [Prime Minister] is ready to open a dialogue; he must call all the political parties. But before passing [CAA] political parties were not consulted. First you implement the law and then you say that you are ready to talk…[if] you are ready to talk, first repeal [CAA] and we are ready to talk, no problem,” Ms. Banerjee said.

The Chief Minister was speaking at a protest where paintings were exhibited. Ms Banerjee also joined in the programme and painted the face of a young girl and wrote “no CAA” across the painting.

Later she said, “The Prime Minister should take people of the country in confidence and assure us that CAA will be repealed (as) many Assemblies have passed resolution it.” Ms Banerjee added that her criticism has nothing to do with the CAA matter pending in the Supreme Court. “I respect the court and I am not talking about the court matters but about the common people,” she said.

‘NPR divisive’

Criticising National Population Register (NPR), Ms Banerjee said if the NPR is introduced, “the country will be divided like anything as NPR and NRC are related and they are a trio [with CAA].”

Ms Banerjee also referred again to the Prime Minister’s repeated references to Pakistan, saying that there is “no need” to promote the neighbouring country in India.

“How long are you [BJP] expected to chant the name of Pakistan? We do not take Pakistan’s name, it is not my country. We are proud of our country, Hindustan, and as a Bengali, but BJP’s political mandate is to glorify Pakistan,” she said.

340,2020/01/28,"Talks about ‘minority takeover’ a way to ‘demonise a population’, says Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee","Observing that minorities in India and the U.S. are “actually minorities” and nowhere close to being dominant, Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee said that he does not feel that it is a “real fear there is going to be a Muslim takeover of India”.

He said that the talk that “one hears at least from the fringes of the ruling party about the demography of the Muslim population.. is really just a way to demonise a population”.

“You could imagine a context when these are two equal groups, and you worry about the other group becoming too powerful. This is just not realistic here,” the Nobel laureate explained, citing the example that African Americans and Mexicans in the U.S. were minorities and were relatively economically and educationally deprived than much better-off economically powerful majority.

The Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was speaking to author Udayan Mukherjee at the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet at the Victoria Memorial Hall grounds late on Monday evening, where he touched on a host of other issues such as migration and whether the country could be in recession while discussing about his book Good Economics for Bad Times.

‘Nothing to suggest we are not in recession’

Asked whether the country was passing through a recession, Mr. Banerjee said that there was no way of knowing and “we were just picking up the symptoms.”

“We have really no way of knowing. It’s not that this question has an answer, and somebody is hiding it. Nobody really knows. We are just picking up the symptoms from different sides,” he said.

Pointing out that the country’s statistical apparatus was essentially incapable of capturing short-term changes in the informal sector, he added, “ If you ask me, could we be in a recession? There is nothing in data that says we could not be in a recession”.

While the economist observed that poverty in the country had fallen dramatically, he pointed out that first time since the 1960s average consumption per capita, as measured by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), had dropped. “The data was in the public domain for a while, and then the government said the data is bad,” Mr. Banerjee added.

He also expressed concerns that India was one the lowest education mobility countries in the world.

‘Net effect of migration zero’

On the question of migration and its economic impacts, he said the net effect of migration was actually been measured in many contexts to be essentially zero.

Describing India as a “ slow migration economy” he said that drivers of migrations across the world were disasters, not economic pulls but push due to disasters.

“So, you have Iraq, Syria, Venezuela supplying migrants to the world. These are not poor countries. These are middle-income countries, with civil wars, complete economic disasters. It’s not economic pull that gets a lot of migrants out. It’s the push,” Mr. Banerjee added.

Greek crisis

Citing an example from the Greek crisis where the unemployment for the young rose to 50 -60 % and the entire welfare system got bankrupt, only 60,000 Greeks left Greece.

“The image of people waiting at the border to rush in, there is no data for it,” he added.

Mr. Banerjee pointed out there was no evidence that migrants depress low-income wages. “I think people have this idea that these people are coming in and they must be taking my job away. But, in fact, what happens when a lot of people come, you end up in a slightly different job. You become the manager for these people, the newcomers; you start a restaurant to feed them,” he said.

On his hopes from the country’s Budget, he added that the money must be pumped in to refinance the banking sector and improve infrastructure. “All the vibes I hear is about tax cuts to the middle class, I don’t think there is much leverage in it,” he added, wishing that the Budget should also not come up with giveaways to the corporate sector.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8f80c7/article30660727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06Jaipur-Literature-Festival2601JPR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/talks-about-minority-takeover-a-way-to-demonise-a-population-says-nobel-laureate-abhijit-banerjee/article30673207.ece
341,2020/01/28,Foot overbridge work nearing completion,"Rajaji Road and Mavoor Road in Kozhikode are undergoing a facelift, the results of which may be quite evident in a couple of months. The foot overbridge with escalator and lift that is coming up across Rajaji Road connecting the mofusil bus stand to V.K. Krishnamenon Indoor Stadium will be launched in March. Coupled with the renovated footpaths along the roads, it is going to streamline the pedestrian traffic in the area and also ease the vehicular traffic as well.

The construction of the foot overbridge and the attached amenities began in February 2019 and is nearing completion. Deputy Mayor Meera Darshak told The Hindu that most of the work was finished and the facility would be ready to be used as soon as the machines (lifts and escalators) were fitted. The machines were being imported from China, she said.

Barricaded footpaths

She said that the footpaths in the area that were being renovated would be barricaded with rails while the median of the road would be reinforced. As a result, pedestrians would not be able to cross the road and would have to depend solely on the overbridge-cum-escalator facility. The lift is to be used by elderly and differently-abled people only, Ms. Darshak said.

A foot overbridge that existed in the same location earlier was brought down as it fell out of use, with pedestrians preferring to walk across the road instead of using it. The regular pedestrian crossing near the indoor stadium is one of the factors that lead to constant traffic congestion near the mofusil bus stand. With the pedestrians using the new facility, the corporation expects that there will be much lesser congestion on the road.

The foot overbridge, escalator, lift and the new tiled footpaths are being constructed at a cost of ₹11.35 crore under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. The work is being carried out by the Uralungal Labour Contractors Cooperative Society. Kochi Metro Rail Limited prepared the structural design. The facility being commissioned in mid-March will be the first of its kind in the State in a corporation.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/foot-overbridge-work-nearing-completion/article30677559.ece
342,2020/01/28,IUML suspends worker for joining LDF’s anti-CAA protest,"The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has suspended from the party a local functionary, K.M. Basheer, after he participated in the CPI(M)-led LDF’s human chain against the citizenship law in Kozhikode on Republic Day.

His participation in the human chain had kicked up a political storm though the IUML leadership, including its national general secretary, P.K. Kunhalikutty, had initially acknowledged that the party cadre were joining anti-CAA protests.

The reason cited for his suspension was that Mr. Basheer, a vice president of the IUML Beypore Assembly constituency, had defied the party decision against participation in such events organised by the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF). Not only that, he had publicly criticised the IUML and Congress leadership for their stand.

Such acts of discipline would not be tolerated in the party, IUML Kozhikode district president Ummer Pandikasala told journalists.

However, Mr. Basheer clarified that he had participated in the human chain just like any other person irrespective of religious, social, and cultural status. It was the right of any citizen to protest against the CAA that had excluded the Muslim community, he said.

At the same time, IUML leader M.K. Muneer, MLA, said that the party and the UDF had decided not to take part in the human chain in the State.

But Mr. Basheer had not only justified his participation in the politically-motivated event but also warned that he would take part in such programmes in the future too.

Mr. Muneer said that the human chain was not a jointly held anti-CAA protest. None of the CPI(M) leaders had turned up when he had staged a hunger strike in Kozhikode against the law, though he had invited their leaders, he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/iuml-suspends-worker-for-joining-ldfs-anti-caa-protest/article30677479.ece

346,2020/01/28,Athikulam channel turns into a sewage carrier,"Athikulam channel on Melur Main Road, opposite the flower market in Mattuthavani, has become a depository of trash and sewage. Owing to public neglect, this channel which drains into Vandiyur tank has layers of plastic waste and garbage - all on a bed of nauseating sewage.

There is an indiscriminate dumping of garbage into the channel, which runs through Athikulam, Pudur and finally reaches Vandiyur tank, said B. Sudha, a shopkeeper.

“The channel runs for about five km and garbage from all these areas gets accumulated here. Madurai Corporation officials removed garbage from this portion of the channel a month back. But their efforts turned futile as people continue to dump waste,” she said.

Due to the lack of a well-organised underground drainage system, untreated sewage from residences is directly discharged into the channel, complained T. Rajkumar, an autorickshaw driver. “A stench of sewage hangs thick in the air throughout the day and makes it impossible to go near the channel,” he adds.

“There is wild growth of water hyacinth in Vandiyur tank, which usually thrives on sewage water,” said S. Elamuhil, Project Executive with Dhan Foundation’s CURE.

Vandiyur tank is a major source for recharging groundwater. But, continuous discharge of sewage into the tank will pollute the groundwater, he added.

“Ideally, the source of sewage discharge into the channel has to be arrested. If not, a sewage treatment plant must be set up to treat sewage and then it should be discharged into the tank,” said Mr. Elamuhil.

A senior Corporation engineer said that due to a burst in a pipeline that leads to Karpaga Nagar pumping station, the civic body officials were forced to discharge sewage into the channel. “Repair works are under way and the issue will be sorted out soon,” the official said.

Also, necessary action will be taken to arrest the discharge of sewage into the channel, the official added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/a4txn2/article30678029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA29CITY-ATHIKULAMCHANNEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/athikulam-channel-turns-into-a-sewage-carrier/article30678030.ece

A headmaster of a Corporation school wishing anonymity said that the School Education department must depute externals to first check these centres prior to the conduct of the exam.

“Since students attend the practical exams in their own school, many externals choose to ignore the mistakes in answers of students caused by poor quality of practical kits.

350,2020/01/28,100-member team to be trained in fighting forest fire,"Following the recent havocs wrecked by fire in Amazon forests and forest in Australia, Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services Department has embarked on a training programme for its commando force personnel to fight forest fire.

“Our Director General of Police, C. Sylendra Babu, has instructed us to be ready to fight forest fire and hence asked to provide proper training to our commando force personnel so that they are adequately equipped,” said Madurai District Forest Officer S. Kalyanakumar.

As part of the initiative, a team of 20 commando personnel started their training at Alagar Hills in Alagarkoil since Monday.

“Along with employees of Lord Kallazhagar Temple, our commando personnel were trained by Forest Department officials on putting out the fire,” he added.

Firemen are trained to fight fire with fire tenders and fire extinguishers wherever these vehicles and equipments could be moved.

However, many pockets in the forest areas, where fire is reported, would be out of bounds for vehicles and extinguishers. “Even availability of water could be very remote,” Mr. Kalyanakumar said.

The Forest Department officials are teaching the commando personnel on how to use the branches of trees for beating fire and dousing the flames.

A mock-drill of fire fighting in the Alagar Hills was also conducted.

351,2020/01/28,Additional funds allocated for Mullaperiyar drinking project,"An addition of ₹275.76 crore has been allocated for the Mullaperiyar drinking water project. This fund will be utilised for provide new water distribution pipelines in the 28 wards that was annexed to Madurai Corporation in 2011.

During the centenary celebrations of late Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced a new project to supply drinking water directly from the Mullaperiyar dam to Madurai city.

By implementing the project, the Corporation plans to supply 125 million litres per day (MLD). The civic body plans to supply water from the Lower Camp near Gudalur to Madurai city through a 143-km-pipeline. Initially, the project had an outlay of ₹1,020 crore.

A senior Corporation engineer said that the funds that were sanctioned earlier would be allocated for the first three phases of the project.

In the first phase, water would be pumped from Lower Camp to Pannaipatti through pipeline, which is 95 km away. There, the water will be treated at a new treatment plant and taken to Madurai city through pipelines.

This additional money is largely funded by the Asian Development Bank, said Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan. The Central and the Tamil Nadu governments will fund the project through Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation. The civic body will also chip in their contribution.

The whole water distribution system across the 100 wards of the Corporation is getting revamped to supply drinking water after implementing the project, said the engineer.

“New drinking water pipelines in 15 wards around Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple are being replaced under Smart Cities Mission. There are also proposals being prepared to source funds for laying new water distribution lines in the other old wards of the city,” said the engineer.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/additional-funds-allocated-for-mullaperiyar-drinking-project/article30677196.ece

He was speaking at an awareness programme on Income Tax Compliance and Returns conducted by the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Income Tax department, here on Monday.

He added that the Madurai Income Tax Commissionerate with jurisdiction over 10 southern districts, collected ₹ 2,000 crore as Income Tax last year. The target was ₹ 2,300 crore for a population of 1.70 crore.

“For this year, out of the target of ₹ 2,418-crore revenue, the Commissionerate had already collected ₹ 1206 crore. This is 51% of the target,” he said. He added that revenue growth percentage is more than in cities like Chennai.

The Chief Commissioner said that in the past, assessing officers were given the choice for scrutiny. This caused disputes and a lack of transparency. Through the new computer-aided selection of scrutiny, officers do not have a choice in the matter and they call for books of accounts for verification.

Speaking about grievance meetings, he said that the event allowed members from economically weaker sections of society to access a help desk. He said that Southern India Regional Council of Chartered Accountants would also provide services on the second Tuesday of each month.

354,2020/01/28,Action sought against teacher,"Seeking action against a teacher, who reportedly asked an eleventh standard student to sit on the floor to write the examination, his mother submitted a petition to the Collector on Tuesday as he is undergoing treatment for cancer.

According to the petitioner and student’s mother S. Syethu Marjuna of Mettukadai near Thuckalay, her son was diagnosed with cancer when he was in class 9 and he, while undergoing treatment for the disease in Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, passed Secondary School Leaving Certificate examination with 410 marks.

Since the treatment had telling side-effects on him, the boy was admitted in Plus One at Government Higher Secondary School in Thuckalay as it is located close to his residence.

“When my son went to write the revision test on Monday, the invigilator of the examination hall, asked my son to sit on the floor and write the test, saying that his hairstyle was improper. Even after my son said he was undergoing treatment for cancer, the teacher did not revoke the punishment besides verbally abusing him. Since my son, who had undergone chemotherapy on January 21 last, sat on the floor for 3 hours from 1.15 p.m. to write the examination, he suffered a lot due to severe pain in the neck as he returned home in the evening. He could not sleep properly due to the excruciating pain that induced depression.

356,2020/01/28,"House, jewellery shop burgled","A jeweller’s house and his showroom were burgled and about 3.50 kgs of gold ornaments worth ₹ 1.32 crore were stolen on Monday night.

The police said the burglar, who burgled jeweller Pon Vijay’s house at Madaththuvilai Viricode under Marthandam police station limits by breaking the door in the first floor, went to the puja room in the ground floor, where the jeweller had kept 65 sovereigns of gold ornaments and ₹ 2 lakh in cash. After taking the valuables from the puja room when everyone was sleeping in the ground floor, the burglar took keys of the jeweller’s showroom in Marthandam and went to the shop where he stole gold ornaments weighing 3 kg.

The crime came to light on Tuesday morning when Mr. Pon Vijay found jewels and cash kept in the puja room missing after seeing the broken door in the first floor. As the jewellery showroom keys were also missing from the puja room, he rushed to the showroom to find theft of jewels worth ₹ 1.13 crore in the shop.

The police rushed to the jewellery showroom with fingerprint experts and sniffer dog. When CCTV footages were analysed, a youth was seen stealing the valuables wearing raincoat with his head covered. Superintendent of Police N. Shreenath, who visited the burgled house and the shop, said the culprit should be known to the shop owner in some way.

“Besides installing CCTV cameras in shops, especially in jewellery showrooms, owners of shops should link cameras with their mobile phones through suitable app so that they will get instant alerts in case of any burglary in their showrooms. It will enable them to alert the police soon,” Mr. Shreenath said.

Soon, the goats one after the other started bleating and they fell down on the ground. Similarly, a cow of A. Ramar, 35, a neighbour of Jeyaprakash, also fell down.

Even as the cattle owners got anxious and attempted to find out what had gone wrong, the animals died one by one.

360,2020/01/28,Madurai city to get its second elevated corridor for Goripalayam junction,"At last, there seems to be some relief coming for road users from traffic jams at Goripalayam junction, provided the proposal of State Highways department for constructing an elevated highway on Alagarkoil Road from Tallakulam Outpost to Albert Victor Bridge gets clearance.

Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa announced in 2012-13 about the construction of a flyover between Tamukkam and A.V. Bridge to decongest the five-road junction at Goripalayam. However, litigation has kept the project in the backburner for years.

However, it looks like the wait is worth as the flyover has given way for an elevated highway that would also decongest traffic at Tamukkum junction and Palam Station Road junction at Sellur also.

The major traffic flow at Goripalayam junction is between Alagarkoil Road and A.V. Bridge and from a good chunk of vehicles coming from Palam Station Road that cut through the junction to reach Panangal Road.

“The flow of traffic in these two routes consumes a lot of time and hence, vehicles get piled up on Alagarkoil Road up to Tamukkam junction,” said a Madurai City Traffic Police Officer.

“Once, the elevated highway with two arms, one from Alagarkoil to A.V. Bridge and another from Alagarkoil to Sellur (beyond the approach road linking Kalpalam bridge with Palam Station Road) are in place, vehicles that cut through the traffic from multiple sides will come down drastically,” said an Engineer from State Highways.

A flyover can be justified if 10,000 vehicles pass through a junction in one hour. However, at Goripalayam, at least 13,000 vehicles are passing in one hour, he added.

“It takes at least 15 minutes to cross the Goripalayam junction during peak hours. A flyover is badly needed here,” said M. Ramesh, 52, a civil engineer from Viswanathampuram.

A regular user of Goripalayam junction, Mr. Ramesh said that the elevated highway will be an infrastructure to fulfil futuristic needs. However, he wants the Highways officials to have the best design of piers so that devotees do not face any hindrance during Chithirai festival when Lord Kallazhagar comes to the city. The elevated highway is of three parts.

At the outpost, it has been proposed to merge the new elevated highway with that of the first elevated highway of the city under construction by National Highways Authority of India on New Natham Road between Chokkikkulam and Oomachikulam.

While vehicles from New Natham Road will have a seamless elevated highway from Ooomachikulam up to Anna Statue on East Veli Street, vehicles from Melur Road will climb up the Goripalayam elevated highway at Outpost.

“An approach road and ramp of 7.5 metres would be constructed at Outpost for the vehicles coming from Melur Road and then after the merger with NHAI bridge, the bridge would become 12 metres up to the approach road of A.V. Bridge,” he said.

This entire Goripalayam elevated highway will provide one-way vehicular traffic towards A.V. Bridge. For the vehicles coming from Old Natham Road and Postal and Telegram Nagar, another ramp would be provided at Tamukkam along the BSNL office for climbing up the bridge.

The alignment of the bridge that would run in the middle of Alagarkoil Road up to Tamukkam junction will thereafter run over the left half of the remaining part of Alagarkoil.

The elevated road then would have a second arm branching out some 100 metres ahead of the junction and it would take a right turn towards Palam Station Road and landing would be provided beyond the Pandalgudi channel junction.

As the elevated bridge would land at the approach road of A.V. Bridge, a new bridge across Vaigai river, parallel and close to A.V. Bridge would be constructed that would facilitate free flow of vehicles coming from Panangal Road to reach the south of Vaigai.

The vehicular movement on Alagarkoil Road under the bridge would continue as usual. Vehicles from Palam Station Road going towards Panangal Road and Alagarkoil Road would go under the bridges as usual.

Another highways official said that the elevated road would ensure lesser traffic on Tamukkam junction and that would help reopening of right turn from Goripalayam towards Gandhi Museum Road and right turn from Gandhi Museum Road towards Gokahale Road providing shorter routes for road users.

“The project is at the proposal level. It requires clearances from multiple agencies and technical approval from State government. Based on the design, land acquisition will have to be taken up,” he added. The estimated cost of the work is ₹ 200 crore.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/h9nssv/article30675965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MAMapFlyover,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-city-to-get-its-second-elevated-corridor-for-goripalayam-junction/article30675966.ece
361,2020/01/28,Four held in murder case,"The police have arrested four persons including a DMK functionary for allegedly stabbing to death a youth and critically injuring two others.

They said DMK’s Madha Nagar ward secretary P. Ravi alias Pon Pandi alias ‘Bar’ Ravi, 36, of Madha Nagar under Thalamuthu Nagar police station limits, who is running a bar attached to a liquor shop of TASMAC, is administering a temple in the same area. As he earned the enmity of M. Muthuselvam, 23, of the same area over administering the temple, they were reportedly involved in frequent heated argument.

Against this backdrop, Muthuselvam and his friends R. Selvam, 20, C. Muthukumar, 36, also from the same area, were standing near the temple around 11.30 p.m. on Monday. As ‘Bar’ Ravi, his friends M. Parthasarathi, 25, M. Esakkimuthu, 26 and C. Kanagaraj, 32, came to the spot, it triggered a brawl between the two groups in which Muthuselvam, Selvam and Muthukumar were stabbed.

Though they were taken to the Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital, Selvam succumbed to his injuries around 2 a.m. while the badly injured Muthuselvam and Muthukumar were undergoing treatment.

362,2020/01/28,Traffic rule violations continue,"Though the police have taken efforts to create awareness of the importance of strictly following traffic rules among motorists and the public, roads are yet to become safer for users.

Private bus drivers are notorious in violating rules in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai. They show no respect to road rules. They terrorise road users with their lightning speed and air horns as they are involved in cut-throat competition with their competitors to collect more money. So, they halt buses suddenly wherever they want to take or drop commuters.

After leaving the Palayamkottai bus stand for Tirunelveli Junction, they stop vehicles on the middle of the road opposite State Bank of India’s Palayamkottai branch, just 75 metres away from the bus stand, to pick up passengers.

Almost all buses, including the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation buses, halt at the busy Samathanapuram Junction turning to drop or pick up passengers causing traffic snarl. The badly damaged narrow and busy road at this point makes the situation worse as traffic jam triggers accidents everyday.

School students continue to ride two-wheelers at high speed and without helmets, sometimes with three persons, due to poor enforcement of law.

“When the Chennai City Police nabbed youngsters, who did not have driving licence, the owners of vehicles including their fathers, were booked and they had to pay fine. Similar kind of action should be taken here, which will effectively check violations of this sort,” said social activist Mahesh.

While boys cling to the footboard when going to their schools in the morning or returning to home in the evening, girl students of a college can be seen hanging on the footboard every evening near Palayamkottai bus stand. Though they are warned that such a violation would lead to cancellation of their bus passes, the warning has not been translated into action.

Sources in the police say acute manpower shortage in the traffic wing has badly hampered its functioning and enforcement of law to curb traffic violations. “We’ve to deploy Armed Reserve Police at busy points to regulate the traffic. If we’re given sanctioned strength, our presence will be felt everywhere to act tough against violators,” a senior police officer attached to the traffic wing said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/traffic-rule-violations-continue/article30675864.ece

“The flyover is traffic-worthy and may be opened any day before January 31,” said National Highways Authority of India’s Project Director Shishu Mohan. Its formal opening or inauguration depends upon the protocol, he said.

Mr. Mohan said service roads of the flyover are also ready and certain stretches of them towards Nanthoor will soon be repaired. Work on the underpass at Ujjodi is also complete, he added.

Asked about the charges that the height of the passage beneath the flyover (from Kankanady towards Padil) was just 4.8m and did not conform to the prescribed standards, Mr. Mohan said the height was 5.2m. It was as per the approved design of the project, he added.

Meanwhile, Ivan D’Souza, MLC, led a delegation of Congress members to inspect the work on Monday. He said the flyover could be completed because of the intervention of the district administration. “Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP, did nothing to speed up the work except giving multiple deadlines,” he said.

Mr. Moily, who was Mr. Shetty’s classmate, in a statement here, said the former Minister’s secular attitude and his help to youth in education, sports, and self-employment schemes brought him closer to the people. Mr. Shetty was a politician who had imbibed the virtues of Mahatma Gandhi and Jayaprakash Narayan.

Charukeerthi Bhattaraka Swami of Moodbidri Jain Mutt said Mr. Shetty, as the Muzrai Minister in the Ramakrishna Hegde government, became popular by introducing several schemes. He was closely associated with the Mutt and participated in its programmes.

375,2020/01/28,Tata group firms get together to create ecosystem for EVs,"At least half a dozen Tata group firms have come together to create an ecosystem for electric vehicles (EVs) in India as Tata Motors launched its electric SUV Nexon at an introductory price starting from ₹13.99 lakh.

While Tata Power will provide the charging solutions, Tata Chemicals will manufacture lithium-ion battery cells and Tata Autocomp will work for localisation of the battery pack assembly and motor assembly for the electric vehicle.

TCS has developed the payments application for customers, Croma will provide a digital retail experience to customers, while Tata Motors Finance will provide affordable financing solutions for both personal and fleet segments.

This is the first time Tata Group firms are collaborating in such a manner for an integrated project. The idea is to leverage the expertise of each firm to create an ecosystem for electric vehicles, an idea propagated by Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran two years ago.

At the launch, Mr. Chandrasekaran said, “Through Tata uniEVerse, our group companies have synchronised their efforts to develop a holistic e-mobility ecosystem to accelerate the adoption of EVs in India. I am delighted that this ecosystem has come together with the launch of Tata Nexon EV”

Tata Power has set up over 100 charging stations in India and the number will go up to 300 by March 2020 and to more than 650 by the end of the next fiscal.

Announcing the launch of Nexon EV, Guenter Butschek, CEO & MD, Tata Motors Ltd., said, “The Nexon EV, the high performance, connected vehicle is uniquely suited to address the aspirations of Indian customers, and making EVs mainstream.”

Powered by Ziptron technology, Nexon claims a 312 km range on a single charge, an efficient high-voltage system, fast charging capability and extended battery life.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/pv2jnn/article30677497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THBUTATA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tata-group-firms-get-together-to-create-ecosystem-for-evs/article30677498.ece

“Through our partnerships with SpiceJet and Vistara, our customers have access to an extensive network of cities across India. We do not intend to acquire equity in Air India as we are currently focused on our own organic growth,” the airline said in response to an email query.

It added, “our journey in India has been defined by progressive investment, partnership and growth. We started with two direct routes to Mumbai and Delhi, and now offer 170 weekly services to nine cities. We remain committed to support India’s vision for the tourism and aviation sectors.”

European full-service carrier Lufthansa as well as Singapore Airlines declined comment on the privatisation of Air India.

“Singapore Airlines does not comment on any specific investment opportunities, including in India,” a spokesperson said.

Lufthansa’s spokesperson told The Hindu, “We don’t comment on speculation.” Interested bidders have time until March 31 to submit their interest for Air India, following which financial bids will be sought.

377,2020/01/28,"Maruti net up 4% on tax cut, lower costs","India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki’s consolidated net profit rose 4.12% to ₹1,587.4 crore for the third quarter ended December 2019, on account of a reduction in corporate tax rate, cost reduction efforts and lower commodity prices.

The company had reported a net profit of ₹1,524.5 crore in the September-December 2018 quarter. Consolidated revenue from operations grew 5.29% to ₹20,721.8 crore from the ₹19,680.7 crore in the year-earlier period.

In a statement, the company said it had sold more than 4.37 lakh vehicles during the quarter, higher by 2% compared with the same period of the previous year.

While sales in the domestic market rose 2% to 4,13,698 units, exports stood at 23,663 units.

The company attributed the increase in net profit to “cost reduction efforts, lower operating expenses, lower commodity prices and reduction in corporate tax rate.” However, this was partially offset by higher sales promotion expenses, higher depreciation and lower fair value gains on invested surplus.

For the nine-month period from April-December 2019, consolidated net profit dipped 25.16% to ₹4,355.3 crore while total revenue from operations fell 11% to ₹57,452.3 crore. The firm sold more than 11.78 lakh vehicles, lower by 16% from the year-earlier period.

Discounts climb

During an investor and analyst call, Maruti Suzuki’s CFO Ajay Seth said that during the quarter, average discounts stood at ₹33,000 compared with the ₹24,000 in the same period last year.

To a query on the impact of company’s decision to stop producing diesel vehicles amid transitioning to BS-VI norms, Shashank Srivastava, executive director, marketing and sales, said that overall, the share of diesel vehicles has been on a decline and the trend is likely to continue. Maruti Suzuki expects to increase its share in the petrol car market with upcoming launches, including petrol variants of the Vitara Brezza and the S-Cross.

Mr. Srivastava said the share of diesel vehicles in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment had fallen from 58% in 2012-13 to 30% in December 2019, mainly due to the declining price gap between the fuels and the perception in customers’ minds about diesel being a ‘dirty fuel.’

Currently, the company’s market share was about 50%, of which a little over 40% came from petrol vehicles and the balance from diesel. Mr. Srivastava said it was estimated that the share of petrol vehicles in PVs will go up to 80-85% from the 70% now, “in which case we should be able to maintain our market share.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/kkrgpz/article30677675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/maruti-net-up-4-on-tax-cut-lower-costs/article30677376.ece
378,2020/01/28,"Government should make labour codes a reality by April, says ISF","Indian Staffing Federation (ISF), the apex body representing the staffing/temping industry in the county, has asked the government to make labour codes a reality and get them operational from April this year.

India currently had 44 Central, 387 State labour laws, 67 Central and 1,333 State labour filings and 674 Central and 26,484 State labour compliances.

“Simplification, rationalisation, digitisation of labour laws should be operational on an immediate basis to make them comprehensive, effective, easy to comply,” said the ISF.

To de-congest cities and create more jobs across tier II and tier III cities, the ISF has also asked the government to ensure optimum utilisation of budgetary allocation towards infrastructure and development.

Focus on urbanisation

“The government should focus on urbanisation, smart cities and infrastructural development on top priority to etch a comprehensive growth trajectory of the country.

“Tier II and III cities and semi-urban areas need to have clear and focussed development to help generate employment opportunities within them.

“This will put more money in the hands of people and consumption will improve,’’ said Rituparna Chakraborty, president,ISF.

As per ISF, it is critical for the government to bring back positive sentiments in the domestic market, through necessary budgeting and policy initiatives, thereby unshackling the full potential of country’s high employment sectors such as telecom, e-com and automobiles.

379,2020/01/28,Coal India output in January rises 10.7%,"Coal India on Tuesday said it has registered a double-digit production growth of 10.7% in January.

The company as a whole has been averaging close to 2 MT per day coal output during the month, it said in a BSE filing.

“Coal India Ltd (CIL) clocked double-digit growth of 10.7% in coal production for the month of January 2020, till 27th (January),” it said.

“CIL’s production at 54.17 MT till January 27, was ahead by 5.23 MT in absolute terms on a like-to-like comparison of last year, registering a growth of 10.7%, the first double-digit growth so far during the current fiscal,” the filing said.

A company official said the production spurt came largely on the back of production in Mahanadi Coalfields and South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL) adding “by the end of January, production is likely to be up by another 8 MT.”

Mahanadi Coalfields surged ahead with 21.5% production growth, as of the referred date, followed by SECL with 14.4%.

These are two of the largest producing subsidiaries of CIL, which together contribute close to half of CIL’s total coal output.

Much to the relief of the company, Dipka opencast mine of SECL, the third largest coal producing mine of CIL, came back strongly in record time reaching one lakh tonne per day production.

Dipka’s lower benches were flooded when a non-seasonal river broke the embankment and flooded the mine on September 29, 2019, it said.

“Coal offtake at 48.07 MT, as of 27th January 2020, registered a growth of 6.2% compared to same date last January...,” it said.

There is no shortage of coal in power plants, with a total of 65.66 MT currently available in the system, of which stock at CIL’s pitheads is 31.41 MT.

Thermal power plants were adequately stocked with 34.25 MT of coal (as of January 26), sufficient for 19 days consumption, it said.

The current level of coal stock at power plants is 14.89 MT more than that of the year-ago level. In the year-ago period, it was 19.36 MT.

“Better management of supply logistics ensured that coal stock at various power stations was maintained throughout the year and the number of critical power plants never touched double-digit during 2019-20 as per CEA,” the official said.

After almost three years, the number of NTPC plants and NTPC/JVS having super critical stock was down to zero.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/8pa4zk/article30675041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI1282020001010B,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/coal-india-output-in-january-rises-107/article30675042.ece

In a tweet the minister said: “For making PM @NarendraModi Ji’s vision of 24x7 ‘Power for All’ a reality, @CoalMinistry in co-ordination with @moefcc has got the environment clearances to 17 new and existing coal projects and 3 washeries of @CoalIndiaHQ...”

“These clearances will add 150 million tonnes of coal in @CoalIndiaHQ kitty in next five years and increase its washing capacity by 25 MTPA enabling the company to achieve 1 billion tonnes of coal production by FY23-24,” he tweeted.

The state-owned company will produce 750 million tonnes of coal in the next financial year, the coal ministry had earlier said.

CIL will further produce one billion tonnes of coal by FY2024, it had said.

381,2020/01/28,Tata Motors launches Nexon EV at starting price of ₹13.99 lakh,"Home-grown auto major Tata Motors on Tuesday launched the electric variant of its most-selling compact sports utility vehicle Nexon in the domestic market at a starting price of Rs 13.99 lakh (ex-showroom pan-India).

The company had unveiled the vehicle last December.

Tata Motors plans to launch four more electric vehicle (EV) models, including two SUVs, one hatchback and one sedan in the next 24 months, Tata Sons Group Chairman N Chandrasekaran announced at the launch.

The event was also attended by Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus, Tata Sons.

Powered by Ziptron technology, the electric SUV for the personal segment comes with a range of 312 km on a single charge and a high voltage system, fast charging capability, extended battery life and class leading safety features. Besides, it has 35 connected car features as well.

The Nexon EV will be available in three trim levels across 60 authorised dealerships in 22 cities, the company said at the launch.

The company is closely working with other group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Chemicals, Tata Autocomp, Tata Motors Finance and Croma to create an e-mobility ecosystem, Tata uniEVerse, for faster adoption of EVs in the country, Tata Motors said.

“E-mobility is an irreversible mega-trend and an imperative for addressing pollution and generating job opportunities in India,” Chandrasekaran said.

“After 16 months of strenuous effort, we are delighted to launch India’s own electric SUV, the Nexon EV. This high performance, connected vehicle is uniquely suited to address the aspirations of Indian customers, and making EVs mainstream,” the company’s Managing Director and Chief Executive, Guenter Butschek said.

“We are confident that this game-changing product will further reinforce our commitment towards developing sustainable and responsible mobility solutions for India,” he added.

Powered by Tata uniEVerse, consumers will have access to a suite of e-mobility offerings including charging solutions, innovative retail experiences and easy financing options, it said.

The automaker has partnered with Tata Power to provide end-to-end charging solutions at home, workplace and for captive and public charging.

Similarly, to develop the component supplier ecosystem, the company is collaborating with Tata Chemicals, which is working on manufacturing lithium-ion battery cells, exploring active chemicals manufacturing and battery recycling.

382,2020/01/28,Oil firms set to gain as subsidised LPG prices move up steadily,"State-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) have steadily increased the prices of domestic subsidised cooking gas prices by ₹63 over the last six months to ₹557 per cylinder amid a benign oil price environment.

Increasing the price of domestic subsidised liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder augurs well for the OMCs and will help them to reduce under-recoveries. LPG accounts for the largest share of under-recoveries after diesel prices were freed in 2014.

At the rate of ₹10 per cylinder per month, it would hardly take 15 months for the subsidy to become nil, according to an analyst at Motilal Oswal. Deregulating LPG will not only boost the working capital of the OMCs, but will also aid in privatisation of State-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL).

In the first half of FY20, LPG accounted for ₹11,300 crore of gross under-recoveries of ₹14,000 crore.

The government’s subsidy for LPG under the DBTL (direct benefit transfer for LPG) for 2018-19 stood at ₹31,447 crore, accounting for 84% of the total subsidy of ₹37,397 crore, according to Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) data.

The LPG subsidy for 2018-19 jumped by over 50% to ₹31,447 crore compared to subsidy of ₹20,880 crore in 2017-18.

‘Subsidy won’t go’

“The subsidy under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) will not go as the government is providing free cooking gas to the poor. The government is expected to to have over 8 crore such connections by March 2020 of the total 25 crore LPG customers,” said an oil analyst.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/nrjj15/article30677428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THBULPG,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/oil-firms-set-to-gain-as-subsidised-lpg-prices-move-up-steadily/article30677429.ece
383,2020/01/28,Gold may lose its sheen as investment,"Gold, which has always been the preferred choice of investment in India, is likely to lose its sheen, at least in the jewellery segment. As per a recent Morningstar. study, a combination of government initiatives and shifting preferences is expected to slow the growth of jewellery demand in China and India — two of the world’s largest markets for gold — despite rising incomes.

“In India, the government has long sought to minimise gold imports to strengthen the rupee. This included increased taxes to make gold more expensive to purchase,” stated a report by Morningstar.

“... different factors, like better social security or increased forms of other consumer spending, such as technology, for example, are likely to keep it from fully reaching older generation levels,” it added.

Luxury goods surge

While Chinese gold purchases rose about 15% from 2012 to 2018, purchases of all personal luxury goods rose 230%, which, as per the study, is “representative of gold’s declining share in purchases going forward.”

“We expect the younger generations’ preferences to remain below the levels of older generations, leading to lower gold purchase intensity and slower growth for annual gold jewellery demand, it added.

Central banks and exchange-traded funds, however, will continue to fuel the demand for the yellow metal, as per the study.

“ETF holdings have [seen] resurgence as the investment case has strengthened due to declining Fed-funds rates combined with stable inflation,” stated the report.

The report added that ETF holdings have not been this high since early 2013 when the investment case had just started to weaken as the market expected rate hikes to return.

Interestingly, current ETF holdings are roughly equivalent to an entire year’s worth of mine supply which, as per the report, presents a significant downside risk to the gold price when real rates return higher and ETF holders sell.

Morningstar expects 2020 gold demand to be 8% higher than it was in 2018, leading to its 2020 price forecast of $1,500 per ounce. Gold prices are currently hovering at around $1,580 per ounce.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/30ud5a/article30677348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THBUGOLD,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/gold-may-lose-its-sheen-as-investment/article30677350.ece

Forex traders said rupee is trading in a narrow range amid intensifying coronavirus scare. Moreover, heavy selling in domestic equities and strengthening of the American currency weighed on the domestic unit.

However, easing crude oil prices supported the rupee.

Benchmark Brent crude oil prices moderated to USD 58.67 per barrel, down 1.10%. The fall in crude prices was attributed to expected demand slump over rising coronavirus cases in China.

387,2020/01/28,The tragedy of the regime’s co-travellers,"Recently, in a televised debate, former student leader Kanhaiya Kumar asked a BJP politician to clarify whether or not he was “Godse-virodhi” [against Nathuram Godse]. The BJP veteran, who had earlier parried Mr. Kumar’s charge that he was a “fascist” by asserting that he was actually a “nationalist”, eventually admitted, “No, I am not against Godse”.

If this banal exchange was interesting, it was only because of the ease with which Mr. Kumar was able to demonstrate that for today’s self-proclaimed nationalist, it has become a risky proposition to even publicly disown the man who killed the Father of the Nation. Seven years ago, the risk would have been the other way around — of appearing to endorse the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi. But now, BJP spokespersons can be seen as supporting Godse without fear of being thrown out of the party.

At another level, with every passing day, life is getting tougher for the average BJP supporter, who is discovering that she is faced with the same binary that the party likes to impose on everyone else: either you are a Modi loyalist or you are an anti-national.

The non-ideological supporter

There is a tendency to paint all BJP supporters in the same shade of saffron — that would be a mistake. The party’s core base consists of two kinds of saffron: those sympathetic to the Hindutva ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and those who identify with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But beyond this dual core processor that drives BJP politics, there are a great many who, for various reasons, including those of political expediency, professional advancement, cultural capital or material benefit, chose to throw in their lot with the BJP. Their ideological past may have been hostile or indifferent to the Sangh agenda, but they nonetheless ventured to publicly climb on to the Sangh/Modi bandwagon.

These include individuals with an independent professional identity that preceded their association with the BJP — economists, historians, statisticians, diplomats, journalists, and all kinds of specialists whose loyalty to the truth of their domain expertise would, under normal circumstances, trump their allegiance, if any, to the regime in power.

For many of them, who do not wish to be blind followers of Mr. Modi, the going has not been easy. Many are individuals who, starting from mid-2013, deployed their cultural capital to help build a narrative that Mr. Modi is an economic wizard who would usher in the long-awaited ‘big bang’ reforms. As for Mr. Modi’s political leanings or social track record, these professionals pretended that they didn’t exist. In their heads, Mr. Modi was someone who, as Prime Minister, would dedicate himself solely to the project of making India fulfil its economic destiny.

This fantasy received its first pinprick when the lynchings started. But these non-ideological co-travellers argued that such criminal acts were the handiwork of “fringe elements” and that the Prime Minister could not be held accountable for them.

And then came the first big shock: demonetisation. It should have been evident that this was a hare-brained idea that would decimate the economy. But the believers put their faith above reason. While some of the co-travellers bailed out, a large section of the middle-classes as well as the influencers among the elites hung on, preferring to see it as a political masterstroke rather than as a body blow to the economy that it was.

Demonetisation was followed by the botched roll-out of the Goods and Services (GST) tax. The two together felled the informal sector, which, as it sank, took the formal sector with it. But the regime’s co-travellers — eminent economists among them — kept the faith. What this government needed was more time, they said. Besides, if not Mr. Modi, then who?

The government returned in 2019. But growth did not. Modi 2.0 was not about, as the non-ideological faithful expected, getting on with the business of good governance. Instead, what emerged was a regime shorn of the mask of developmentalism. Its singular focus: implementing the Hindutva agenda. So, first came the criminalisation of triple talaq (instead of making it a civil offence). Then came the dilution of the special status enjoyed by Jammu and Kashmir. And then, in early December, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019. The legislation, and the proposal for a countrywide National Register of Citizens, sparked massive protests that resonated across religious divides.

Defending the indefensible

With the protests showing no signs of abating, the BJP’s co-travellers are everyday being called upon to defend the regime and the party, even as its actions and positions become increasingly tough to justify – from a law that discriminates on the basis of religion, to violent police action against students and minorities. The latest is the announcement by the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh that raising the ‘Azaadi’ slogan would attract the sedition charge.

Not surprisingly, the regime’s recent outreach to Bollywood on the CAA issue received a lukewarm response. Recent international coverage of the Modi regime has been unrelentingly critical. Later this week, the European Parliament will vote on six resolutions that charge India with violating international human right norms. And for all that, the principled Modi supporter is caught in a bind, with little room for principled disagreement.

On the one hand, the economy is showing no signs of revival. On the other, as if to set in relief its dithering on the economic front, the Modi regime has shown itself to be clear-eyed and bold in pursuing its ideological agenda. So much so that it has now become almost impossible for anyone to claim to be a BJP voter or a Modi supporter without also taking ownership of the Hindutva agenda.

Perhaps tragically, the non-ideological co-traveller of the BJP now finds herself at the crossroads: either defend the indefensible and risk your credibility, or break ranks and risk the wrath of the saffron brigade, which controls nearly every arm of the state apparatus. This is not an easy place to be. Those who have gained from tactically boarding the BJP bandwagon – who owe their position to political patronage – have no option but to toe the line, as some university appointees facing social boycott are discovering.

Lastly, it is not as if polarisation only offers benefits to the right-wing. It also exacts a price, by setting off a concatenation of cracks and breaks. These do not stop with the division of families and loss of friendships. The deepest schism – and the most difficult to acknowledge – is the one within the psyche. Of the legions that currently enjoy saffron-hued power, there are many who, their outward bluster notwithstanding, wake up every morning to a self divided against itself.

388,2020/01/28,Assessing the anti-CAA protests,"It has been over six weeks since the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests started in earnest in mid-December. The continuous sit-in in Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi, which has been replicated across the country, has become the model for these protests and stirred the imagination of the people.

The positives

It is time now to assess the positive and negative impacts of these protests. Let us begin with the positives. First, it has been heartening to note that these protests initially attracted support across communal lines and continue to do so, especially in States such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The violence by the police in Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University also sparked protests on various campuses across the country. In many locales, these two streams merged and augmented each other.

Second, it is probably the first time in the history of independent India that so many Muslims have come out on the streets demanding to be heard not just as a minority community but also as full and proud citizens of India. Carrying the national flag, pictures of Gandhi and Ambedkar, and reading from the Preamble of the Constitution, they have made it a fight for the protection of the secular spirit of the Constitution and not just their rights as a religious minority.

Third, ordinary Muslim women have finally become active political participants leading these protests in Shaheen Bagh and in other locations. During the debate on the triple talaq bill, the Modi government had loudly proclaimed that it had the interests of Muslim women at heart. These women have now challenged the government to live up to these claims by heeding their demands to rescind the CAA-National Register of Citizens process. The protesters assert that the future of their children stands threatened as they may be deprived of their citizenship rights.

Now, the negatives. First, the disproportionate violence allegedly used against the protesters, especially in U.P., and documented by journalists has sullied the image of India as a liberal democracy that tolerated dissent and protected the rights of citizens to protest. This has led to negative reports, especially in respected foreign publications such as The New York Times and The Economist.

Second, the government’s response to the protester’s demands has been absolute indifference. No Central Minister has deigned to engage with the protesters, not even of Shaheen Bagh just a few kilometers from the corridors of power. All we have heard is reiteration of the same mantra: that the government will not revisit the CAA; that the protesters are being “misled” by Opposition parties; and that the protests are being engineered by the Congress to defame the government. This attitude once again gives the impression that the government is impervious to criticism and subverts Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s message of “Sab ka Saath, Sab ka Vikas, Sab Ka Vishwas”.

A fundamental error

Third, and possibly the most significant in the long run, is that these continuing sit-ins may have increased the Hindu-Muslim divide, especially in Delhi and U.P. This is reflected in anecdotal and impressionist accounts in the media that these protests, with their predominantly Muslim participation, may be alienating large sections of the Hindus. The organisers of the protest movements made the fundamental error of linking several demonstrations to Friday prayers because they found it the most convenient way of mobilising large crowds pouring out of mosques. The demonstration in old Delhi after Friday prayers at the Jama Masjid on December 21 was the most dramatic symbol of this strategic blunder.

While the anti-CAA protests have demonstrated many positive signs likely to strengthen India’s democratic political culture, there is a danger of communal polarisation if the protesters form too close a bond with a religious identity.

389,2020/01/28,The road to genocide,"The 27th of January marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, a date that is now observed as ‘International Holocaust Remembrance Day’. Of the 5.5 million-6 million people killed in the Holocaust, about 9,60,000 are believed to have died at the Auschwitz complex, built to house both concentration and extermination camps. (The former were built by the Third Reich to imprison people it considered ‘undesirable’; the extermination camps served to obliterate them on an industrial scale.) As we reflect on the millions who were ‘exterminated’ (a term usually associated with pest control) it might be worth recalling how the Jewish people were first isolated and ostracised and then stripped of their humanity.

By 1945, the ‘Final Solution’ to the ‘Jewish problem’, the careful euphemism using which the Germans meant to kill every last Jew in Europe, claimed two-thirds of Europe’s Jewish population. However, as most historians agree, it is important to note that there was probably no single decision taken by the Nazis to rid Europe of its Jewish population; instead, the ‘Final Solution’ was enabled by a series of incremental policies and pronouncements by the regime from the time they came to power. If the horror of the emerging policies was apparent to those within and outside the country, it seems they chose to look away.

The first stage was the identification and registration of all Jews, which then enabled the confiscation of their property under various pretexts, followed by the passage of laws to circumscribe their citizenship, means of livelihood and access to legal remedies. The state-sponsored intimidation, impoverishment and alienation succeeded in driving out about 37,000 Jewish people in 1933 alone. When the violence of Nazi party activists started affecting Germany’s image and economy in 1935, Hitler, mindful of the upcoming Munich Olympics in 1936, had the activists reined in. However, they were placated through legislation.

The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 defined ‘Jewishness’ and ‘German citizenship’. The first of the two laws clarified who was ‘Jewish’ and forbade intermarriage between Germans and Jewish people, in addition to disallowing the employment of German women under the age of 45 in Jewish households: the statute was tellingly named the ‘Law to Protect German Blood and German Honour’. German citizenship was defined by blood, and continually reaffirmed through ‘conduct’, requiring the citizen to be “willing and fit to serve the German People and Reich”. Together, these laws completed the social and economic segregation and stigmatisation of an entire community. This state-sponsored persecution culminated in Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass, in November 1938, when Nazi paramilitaries and civilians attacked Jewish homes, businesses, hospitals and synagogues, while German authorities looked on.

Constant demonisation

Those that did not or could not emigrate were driven into ghettoes following the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939. The ghettoes allowed Nazi functionaries to efficiently round up whole families for concentration camps by 1941. All the while, the demonisation of Jews ensured that they began to be considered ‘subhuman’, a phrase used by Field Marshal Walter von Reichenau in 1941 in his now infamous ‘Severity Order’.

Reichenau, through the order promulgated on October 10, 1941, asked the German Sixth Army (of the Eastern Front) to remember that “the most important objective of this campaign against the Jewish Bolshevik system is the complete destruction of its sources of power and the extermination of the Asiatic influence in European civilisation.” It went on to state that “for this reason, the soldier must learn to fully appreciate the necessity for the severe but just retribution that must be meted out to the subhuman species of Jewry.” Thus, having stripped them of their humanity, the regime moved with clinical efficiency to annihilate the Jewish people.

Reichenau’s carefully phrased term “severe but just retribution” was code for killing, and similar versions were circulated amongst different commands, so that large parts of the Wehrmacht were ordered to treat Jews as partisans and kill them. This led to one of the most brutal phases in the Holocaust whereby Einsatzgruppen, or Nazi death squads, in collaboration with the Wehrmacht and local auxiliary units in German-occupied territories in Poland and the Soviet Union rounded up and shot 1.3 million Jews. Initially, the squads gathered Jewish men and boys, along with members of the intelligentsia and political opponents (not all of whom were Jews). They were then executed on various trumped-up charges, ranging from attempts to escape, to inciting disaffection. Over time, the fig leaf of cause was discarded; simultaneously, the net was widened to include women and children.

Rounded up, marched and shot

The two most infamous killings of the Einsatzgruppen were the massacres of Babi Yar, near Kiev, when 33,771 Jews are said to have been murdered; and Rumbula, near Riga, which claimed 25,000 lives in two days in November and December 1941. Details from Babi Yar are sufficient to demonstrate the dehumanising brutality meted out. Between September 29 and 30, 1941, a total of 33,771 Jews were reportedly rounded up and taken to a ravine just outside Kiev, required to undress and leave their valuables in a pile. They were then marched in orderly lots to the ravine, made to lie down and shot at point blank range in the neck or head. Thereafter, the next group was marched in, made to lie on the bodies, and similarly executed. After two days of shooting, the Germans blasted the walls of the ravine to bury the victims, not all of whom had died by then. Their clothes and valuables were distributed amongst local ethnic Germans.

Compounding the tragedy was the fact that the Einsatzgruppen were assisted by locals, often in a ratio of 10 locals to 1 paramilitary. The invading Germans were also successful in instigating locals to riot against Jewish people as they marched into newly captured territories; in the six months following the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, over 60 pogroms in Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine claimed about 24,000 Jewish lives. However, the shootings were proving inefficient and costly. When the ‘Final Solution’ was agreed to in January 1942, the numbers were too great and army commanders were complaining that the shootings were affecting soldiers’ morale.

Sent to gas chambers

And so, the logical next step was to industrialise the killings, using the gas chambers. The Nazis had experimented with gas earlier, when they euthanised those they branded as “undesirable” or weak. The gas chambers scaled up the operation. The example of Auschwitz should suffice. Historians estimate that of the 1.3 million who were sent to Auschwitz, 1.1 million died — most killed by gassing, the rest felled by disease, exhaustion or starvation.

Of the 1.3 million, only 2,05,000 were registered, which means that they were separated on arrival as they were considered fit enough to work; 25,000 were sent to other camps; and 8,65,000 are believed to have been sent directly to the gas chambers. By 1942, four additional gas chambers with their attached crematoria were built in Auschwitz II, with a rail spur leading directly to chambers II and III; each of the gas chambers could hold 2,000 people (though they often held more) and the combined capacity of the crematoria and outside incineration pits was 20,000 corpses a day.

Those to be ‘exterminated’ were led to chambers under the guise of being deloused, made to undress and sent into what looked like a shower room; once they were inside, the chamber was sealed and the cyanide released into it via specially constructed openings. Death in those frantically overcrowded rooms occurred after some minutes of terror. The corpses were then harvested: any remaining jewellery was removed, the women’s hair was cut to be sold in the market, and dentists extracted gold fillings from the teeth of the dead. Between 1940 and 1942, 50 kg of gold was collected. By 1944, 10 kg-12 kg of gold was being harvested each month. The dehumanisation of the exterminated was complete.

As head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, was to explain to his lieutenants at Posen (in occupied Poland) on October 6, 1943, “We were faced with the question: what about the women and children? – I have decided on a solution to this problem. I did not consider myself justified to exterminate the men only — in other words, to kill them or have them killed while allowing the avengers, in the form of their children, to grow up in the midst of our sons and grandsons. The difficult decision had to be made to have this people disappear from the earth.”

This is what death looks like when we dehumanise the dying. It sullies us all. May we never forget.

390,2020/01/28,A case of wholehearted biotechnology adoption,"In the Editorial page article, “The flawed spin to India’s cotton story” (January 23, 2020), there are unfounded claims about a technology that has in reality been a boon to farmers across the world.

The first point made in the article is that GM cotton covers 95% of the area under cotton and that there are no choices for farmers. The fact: Indian farmers have voted for choice of seeds with biotechnologies by planting hybrid cotton biotech seeds on over 90% of the country’s cotton acreage. They want seeds and technologies that provide optimal yield, income and convenience in cultivation. Today, they choose from over 800 hybrid Bt cotton seed brands from over 40 Indian and global seed companies, with five approved ‘in-the-seed’ insect protection Bt cotton technologies and non-Bt varietal cotton seeds. Farmers have not shown any preference for planting non-Bt cotton seeds including the quantity supplied along with the Bt cotton seed by seed companies as per regulatory guidelines.

Ripple-effect benefits

Several key studies by third-party economists and sociologists have established that 85% of hybrid Bt cotton seed farmers and farm labourers invested in better education for children; 77% reported better intake of nutritious food; 75% reported better health of their family members; 64% invested on the health of livestock; female workers on Bt cotton fields earned an average 55% higher income; and 42.4 crore additional days of rural employment have been generated, thereby doubling cotton production.

India’s farmers are the ones who have reposed trust in biotechnology, making India the world’s second largest cotton producer and exporter by doubling cotton production over the past decade.

Cotton Corporation of India data show that the highest production of 398 lakh bales of cotton in India was achieved in 2013-14, valued at around ₹72,000 crore. Additional incomes were generated from cotton seeds oil (1.3 million tons) and cotton seed oilmeal (11 million tons) worth ₹13,000 crore and ₹22,000 crore, respectively. The Bt cotton seed market is about ₹3,000 crore, making it hardly 2.5% of the total value generated.

The article’s second point is about low productivity as compared to the global scene. The fact is that technology has not only increased yields but also greatly reduced pesticide use. Biotechnology in cotton, post its introduction in 2002, has led to transformational changes in India’s cotton cultivation. These have helped increase cotton yields by over 1.8 times — from 241 kg/hectare in 2002-2003 to 541 kg/hectare in 2018-2019. A BKS-CSD study shows that the significant increase in farmer incomes from higher yields and reduced pesticide use has generated additional farm income of over ₹42,300 crore. India is moving to first place as the largest producer of cotton in the world.

Extension efforts

However, it is not just the technology that increases yields. India’s farmers face numerous uncertainties and crop management challenges, affecting farm yield and incomes; knowledge of cultivation and correct agronomic practices can make a significant impact. This is being addressed by numerous extension efforts.

There is an opportunity to increase yields further in India when compared to other countries that have been using even more advanced GM traits than what is being used in India. New technology introduction has stopped in India since 2005, affecting growth of yields.

The article’s third point is about the availability of low cost manual labour. The fact is that one of the major challenges lies in securing labour to conduct field operations. Today, labour accounts for over 58% of a farmer’s cost of cultivation per acre. In a fast-evolving global market, India’s farmers instead need the best technologies to remain competitive.

The next claim is about varieties offering farmers increased benefits than hybrid cotton seeds. The fact is that Indian farmers who were using varieties for years switched to hybrids in the mid-1980s mainly because of the enormous benefits. Cotton Advisory Board data show that India’s cotton yields which were at 169 kg/hectare in 1980-81 increased to 278 kg/hectare in 2000-01 and then 542 kg/ hectare in 2016-17.

The writer’s argument that High Density Planting (HDP) took place in various countries after introduction of biotech cotton is inaccurate. Planting rates are determined by several agronomic and environmental conditions and not based on biotech versus non-biotech. There is also no change in the seed rate in any of the countries in which biotech cotton has been adopted. HDP has done well in India because of the better quality of germplasm.

Also, Turkey is not a large cotton producer. USDA statistics in 2017-18 shows that India leads with 35m bales, followed by China (28m bales), the U.S. (21m bales), Brazil (9m bales) and Australia (5m bales). All of them are GM cotton countries, contributing to more than 90% of global cotton production. GM cotton was introduced in Brazil in 2006-07.

India also produces hybrid cotton seed because of the availability of labour to carry out the hand pollination at reasonable cost; this is not available in the U.S., Brazil, Australia and China. Hybrid cotton has delivered not only higher yields but also provided resistance to some pests and diseases.

The article also claims that Indian farmers need to buy seeds repeatedly. The fact is that not just biotech cotton, but all hybrid seeds lose their benefits if replanted, creating reduced and erratic yields. New seeds help farmers sustain high yields year on year.

In the case of biotech cotton in India, it is the farmers who adopted the technology wholeheartedly because they saw a solution in it to some of their biggest on-field pest challenges. The choice made by the Indian farmer to plant hybrid cotton seeds on over 90% of cotton acreage, and see increased cotton production is testament to the value created by better seeds, technologies and farming practices — when compared with the alternative of low tech seed and insecticide sprays.

Bt cotton was released in varieties by some public institutions but it did not get much traction. There is always a debate about the use of hybrids versus varieties in any crop. The writer appears to be giving too much power to the seed industry in terms of influencing the farmer to prefer hybrids over varieties. This has not happened in the case of rice, mustard, many oilseeds, and pulses in which the farmers grow varietal crops in 90-100% of the area. The lesson is that the farmer adopts technologies which are beneficial to him and does not go by the recommendations of the industry or any other persons.

Seeds with biotechnologies have helped conserve biodiversity: with higher production from the same area, the expansion of agricultural land into forest areas has been slowed.

A one-sided depiction not only harms agriculture and the industry but also spreads misconceptions about biotechnology.

391,2020/01/28,Crime and politics: on political candidates with criminal records,"The Supreme Court has taken a timely decision by agreeing to hear a plea from the Election Commission of India (ECI) to direct political parties to not field candidates with criminal antecedents. The immediate provocation is the finding that 46% of Members of Parliament have criminal records. While the number might be inflated as many politicians tend to be charged with relatively minor offences —“unlawful assembly” and “defamation” — the real worry is that the current cohort of Lok Sabha MPs has the highest (29%) proportion of those with serious declared criminal cases compared to its recent predecessors. Researchers have found that such candidates with serious records seem to do well despite their public image, largely due to their ability to finance their own elections and bring substantive resources to their respective parties. Some voters tend to view such candidates through a narrow prism: of being able to represent their interests by hook or by crook. Others do not seek to punish these candidates in instances where they are in contest with other candidates with similar records. Either way, these unhealthy tendencies in the democratic system reflect a poor image of the nature of India’s state institutions and the quality of its elected representatives.

The Supreme Court has come up with a series of landmark judgments on addressing this issue. It removed the statutory protection of convicted legislators from immediate disqualification in 2013, and in 2014, directed the completion of trials involving elected representatives within a year. In 2017, it asked the Centre to frame a scheme to appoint special courts to exclusively try cases against politicians, and for political parties to publicise pending criminal cases faced by their candidates in 2018. But these have not been a deterrent to legislators with dubious credentials. Perhaps what would do the trick is a rule that disallows candidates against whom charges have been framed in court for serious offences, but this is something for Parliament to consider as an amendment to the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This denouement, however, is still a pie in the sky given the composition of the Lower House with a number of representatives facing serious cases. Ultimately, this is a consequence of a structural problem in Indian democracy and the nature of the Indian state. While formally, the institutions of the state are present and subject to the electoral will of the people, substantively, they are still relatively weak and lackadaisical in governance and delivery of public goods, which has allowed cynical voters to elect candidates despite their dubious credentials and for their ability to work on a patronage system. While judicial pronouncements on making it difficult for criminal candidates to contest are necessary, only enhanced awareness and increased democratic participation could create the right conditions for the decriminalisation of politics.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crime-and-politics/article30668919.ece
392,2020/01/28,Abolition politics: on A.P. Cabinet nod to abolish Legislative Council,"The abolition and revival of the second chamber in State legislatures have become matters of political expediency. Andhra Pradesh is the latest State to favour the alteration of the status quo regarding the Upper House, in an Assembly resolution for its Legislative Council’s abolition. A.P. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s drastic step comes after key legislation intended to take forward his three-capital proposal was referred to a select committee by the Council, in which his party does not have a majority. His grievance: the Council is working with a political agenda to block his proposal. While the need for a bicameral legislature in the States has often been questioned, few would support the idea that the potential difficulty in getting the Council’s approval should be a reason for its abolition. Chief Ministers ought to bear the possible delay that the Council’s opinion or course of action may cause, and seek to build a legislative consensus instead of pushing their agenda through. In particular, Mr. Reddy will have to listen to different voices on his proposal to locate the State High Court in Kurnool, its legislature in Amaravati, and the government secretariat in Visakhapatnam.

A.P.’s proposal will bear fruit only if Parliament passes a law to that effect, based on the State’s request. Recent experience suggests that States without a Legislative Council favour its revival. Rajasthan, Assam, Odisha and Madhya Pradesh have passed resolutions for a revival, but are yet to get parliamentary approval. In Tamil Nadu, at least two erstwhile DMK regimes had favoured revival, and even parliamentary approval given in 2010 did not result in the actual re-establishment of the Council, which was dissolved in 1986. In A.P., the N.T. Rama Rao regime sought its abolition in 1983, and it was approved by Parliament in 1985. Under the Congress’s Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, the Legislative Council was revived in 2007. It is quite clear that wherever the Council is sought to be revived or abolished, there is no consensus. A parliamentary committee that went into the Bills introduced in respect of Assam and Rajasthan suggested that the Centre evolve a national policy on having an Upper House in the States. The larger question is whether the Councils are serving their intended purpose — to take a considered view on matters without being influenced by electoral considerations. If the Upper Houses are used only for accommodating leaders who have lost general elections, there may not be much meaning in their existence. And there is less justification for having separate representation in Councils for graduates and local bodies when democracy has taken roots and Assemblies are representative of all sections.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/abolition-politics/article30668936.ece

394,2020/01/28,Coronavirus: 5 more quarantined in Bengaluru,"Worried over a possible exposure to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV), which has infected a large number of people in China, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, and the United States, five more people with a travel history to China have self-reported to the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) since Monday night.

Following reports of the outbreak spreading in China and its neighbouring countries, more people with a travel history to these countries are coming to the institute to get tested. Those with symptoms are being quarantined. As many as 3,275 passengers have been screened at the Kempegowda International Airport since January 20.

Since January 24, a total of eight people were under observation. While one person, who was the first suspected case quarantined at the hospital, was discharged on Tuesday morning, another 40-year-old who had self-reported on Monday, refused to continue isolation in the hospital and instead requested home isolation.“We are sending him home on the condition that he will be under the supervision of surveillance officers.

Apart from him, there are six more at the hospital now. While one reported late on Monday night, four came on Tuesday. All these six have a travel history to China (Chengdu, Beijing and Shangai) but not Wuhan. They have mild symptoms — runny nose and sore throat — and their samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for tests,” said RGICD Director C Nagaraja.

Meanwhile, the State Health and Family Welfare Department has asked all private hospitals to set aside ten beds, exclusively for 2019-nCOV cases. “As some patients may prefer treatment in a private hospital, it is important that the private hospitals are equipped to handle the cases,” B.G. Prakash Kumar, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), told The Hindu on Tuesday.

The department organised an orientation programme on the virus for doctors from both private and government hospitals. “We have shared standard guidelines and treatment protocol to be followed.

395,2020/01/28,BBMP locks apartment complex gate over property tax dues,"First they tried beating drums; then they put up posters and even seized furniture in the hope of shaming defaulters into paying pending property tax dues.

On Tuesday, frustrated Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials hit upon another novel idea — they staged a protest outside the gate of an apartment complex near Peenya metro station with the hope of collecting ₹22 crore from one of the blocks inside the complex that had not paid the dues.

Shive Gowda K., BBMP’s Deputy Commissioner, Rajarajeshwarinagar zone, said the BBMP had issued a distress warrant a week ago. “When we went to the apartment complex on Tuesday, we locked the gate and put up posters,” he said.

The civic body will write to the Department of Stamps and Registration to make a note of the property tax due in the encumbrance certificates issued by the jurisdictional sub-registrars.

“Civic commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar will also write to the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) and Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (BESCOM) to disconnect water and power connections to the block,” said Mr. Gowda.

There are a total of 1,676 housing units in the apartment complex, which has seven blocks, of which one of the blocks with 162 units of serviced apartments has defaulted. “Around 11 years ago, the BBMP had fixed the property tax at commercial rates. However, the apartment complex had filed an appeal. Around two months ago, the Standing Committee for Appeals upheld the BBMP’s move and rejected the appeal, following which demand notices were issued,” he added.

396,2020/01/28,Govt. gets tough on anti-ragging rules after 15-year-old student is beaten up in hostel,"After a 15-year-old American student was allegedly ragged by three of his classmates in the hostel of an international school on the outskirts of the city earlier this month, the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has decided to send strict instructions to schools to follow the rules pertaining to anti-ragging.

Speaking to The Hindu, Commissioner for Public Instruction, K.G. Jagadeesha said school managements will again be directed to set up anti-ragging committees, as mandated in the rules. They will also have to create awareness on the role of these committees.

“The rules, stipulated against ragging, are stringent and are also mandated as part of the safety and security guidelines issued by the department. This committee must have the involvement of the local police and should focus on preventing ragging and bullying,” said department officials.

The move has been welcomed by parents who feel some students get bullied by their peers and that the incidents go unchecked. Sujaya S., a parent of a class 10 student said, “Unfortunately, schools tend to brush bullying under the carpet by terming it as a fight among students. There is a need to ensure that principals and teachers treat this issue more seriously,” she said.

Commission orders probe

The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has also asked education officials to conduct a spot inspection. Based on a complaint filed by Bengaluru-based social activist T Narasimhamurthy, the commission has instructed officials to conduct a probe, inspect the school and take necessary action against the management. It also directed officials to visit the victim and inquire about his condition and submit a detailed report within three days.

Mr Jagadeesha also said the DPI officials would conduct a detailed inquiry regarding the incident and ensure that suitable action is taken against the school management if lapses were found on its part.

The victim, a class 9 student, was allegedly beaten up by three boys in his hostel room. He suffered multiple injuries and the case has been referred to a Juvenile Justice Board. The three boys have been suspended, along with another minor who kept guard and ensured that the hostel warden did not enter the room.

The police, who initially refused to file an FIR against the school management, have now filed a case naming the founder-chairman and other officials as accused. However, the school management has refused to call it ragging and has termed it a “boys fight”.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/govt-gets-tough-on-anti-ragging-rules-after-15-year-old-student-is-beaten-up-in-hostel/article30675439.ece

The residents suspect poisoning. The dogs that are ill have been hospitalised. Samples of their viscera will be collected and sent for forensic test to determine if there was any poisoning, sources said.

Isha Pant, DCP (South), said the J.P. Nagar police have taken up a case against unidentified individuals under Section 429 of Indian Penal Code for causing “mischief by killing or maiming cattle”. “The residents also do not suspect any particular person to be behind the act. We are examining CCTV footage from the area and will soon ascertain who is behind the act,” she said.

Meanwhile, a senior police official said there have been earlier cases where home burglars targeted stray dogs before committing burglary in a particular residential area and this was a possibility here too.

399,2020/01/28,Kempegowda International Airport had over 33 million passengers in 2019,"The Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), Bengaluru, had as many as 33.65 million passengers during the calendar year 2019, registering a 4.1% growth, compared to the previous year’s 32.33 million.

A press release said here on Monday that international passenger traffic witnessed a growth of 14% from 4.27 million in 2018 to 4.87 million in 2019, while domestic traffic grew by 2.6% from 28.05 million in 2018 to 28.78 million in 2019.

“2019 has been a turbulent year for Indian aviation, mostly impacted by the closure of a large airline and supply-side challenges caused by the grounding of some aircraft types,” said the release, adding that this had a ripple effect on KIA as well.

“ATMs (air traffic movements) at KIA were down from 2,35,190 ATMs in 2018 to 2,35,058. Notably, international movements remained on the upswing, growing by 13% with a total of 30,556 ATMs as compared to 26,966 ATMs in 2018, owing to the launch of new routes and new flights during winter 2018. Domestic movements saw a slump of 1.8% to 2,04,502 ATMs from 2,08,224 ATMs in 2018,” the release added.

Domestic cargo remained ‘positive’, it said, registering a 4.1% growth. The total domestic cargo processed during this period was 1,49,603 Metric Tonnes (MT), as against 1,43,701 MT in 2018. In the same period, international cargo dropped by 4.1%, with the overall cargo shipment down by 1.0%.

“The aviation market in India is in recovery mode after a volatile period. We estimate that passenger volume at KIA will be between 55 to 65 million passengers per annum (mppa) in the next five years. To support this growth, BIAL is investing ₹13,000 crore for infrastructure expansion, including the South Runway, which is operational, and the first phase of Terminal 2,” said Hari Marar, MD and CEO, BIAL, adding that the airport has also seen many technological initiatives such as fully-automated self-bag-drop machines and smart security lanes.

Other highlights

Among the airlines, Indigo continued to lead as their passenger figures, to and from Bengaluru, rose by 13% from 13.81 mppa in 2018 to 15.61 mppa in 2019.

Delhi (13,186) and Mumbai (11,801) continued to be the most travelled destinations from Bengaluru.

Singapore (1,628) and Dubai (1,488) were the top international cities by annual scheduled passenger movement.

Seven new destinations and two new international airlines were introduced during the course of the calendar year. Two more — to Tokyo and Munich — are set to operate from summer 2020.

Currently, Bengaluru is connected to 82 destinations, including 25 international cities, with 36 passenger airlines, in addition to 14 cargo airlines.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hl2gga/article30670170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGKEMPEGOWDAINTERNATIONALAIRPORTBENGALURU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kia-had-over-33-million-passengers-in-2019/article30670171.ece
400,2020/01/28,"Class 9 American student ragged, beaten up in international school","A 15-year-old American citizen was allegedly ragged by three of his classmates in the hostel of an international school on the outskirts of the city earlier this month. The parents have alleged that the jurisdictional police station initially refused to file an FIR against the school management.

Explaining the sequence of events, the father of the victim said the incident took place in the second week of January at the international residential school in the Harohalli police station limits. When contacted, the school authorities refused to acknowledge it as a case of ragging and termed it a “boys’ fight.”

Speaking to The Hindu, the father of the victim said when his son returned to his room after dinner, three classmates entered the room, locked the door and started beating him up, while a fourth boy stood and watched. This went on for half an hour.

“They later thought that the wardens may come to his room and dragged him to the toilet, smashed his head in the toilet and he was bleeding. He was told not to inform anyone about the incident and was asked to take a bath. He slept that entire night in pain and went to the doctor the next day,” the parent said.

The doctor later admitted him in the school hospital. “My son did not want to tell anyone that he was beaten up as he was scared, so he told them that he had slipped in the bathroom. His head, lips and chest were injured and I smelt foul play and asked for photographs to be sent. After seeing the photographs, I learnt that this could not have been an injury due to the fall in the bathroom,” the parent said.

The parent alleged that when he asked the school authorities if he could speak to his son, they initially said he could speak to him only after a fortnight, but later relented and allowed the parent to talk to his son.

The parents approached the Harohalli police last week, but said the police refused to file an FIR against the school management. The parent said he is now concerned about the safety and security of other students in the school. He alleged that the same group of students ragged him four months ago and he had brought it to the notice of the authorities concerned in school, but no action was taken.

Dr. Anup Shetty, superintendent of police, Ramanagara said there were two parts to the probe into the incident. “The victim, a class IX student, was allegedly beaten up by three of his classmates – all of them minors. So we have initiated an inquiry against the three students under Juvenile Justice Act and issued them notices,” he said.

Meanwhile, the father approached a local court with a private complaint seeking a case against the school administration for negligence. Based on the direction from the court, Harohalli police registered a case against the administration of school, its chairman and an office-bearer.

The parent has accused the school of not informing the parents for a long time since the incident, and that the victim was treated only in the medical facility at the school and the doctors also showed negligence. The FIR has booked the administration of the school under Section 202 of Indian Penal Code for “intentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to inform”.

The school authorities have said transfer certificates had been given to all the accused boys. “Investigation is on to decide if action is to be initiated against any of the staff,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/class-9-american-student-ragged-beaten-up-in-international-school/article30670148.ece
401,2020/01/28,‘Students aiming to study abroad must figure out their priorities first’,"The two-day The Hindu International Education Fair (IEF) 2020 opened at Christ (Deemed to be University), Bengaluru, on Monday with a large number of undergraduate, graduate and high school students attending.

The stalls had universities from India and abroad, higher education consultancy firms, and educational representatives from foreign countries. The highlight of the fair was the day-long seminar by speakers representing some of the countries most preferred by Indian students for higher education. A large number of parents also attended the sessions.

Delivering the keynote address, Nicole Girard, Consul General of Canada, Canadian Consulate, Bengaluru, said: “People in Canada trace their origins to almost every part of the world, and hence Canadian values are formed by multi-ethnic culture. We value linguistic, religious, and other kinds of minorities.” Like India, Canada also has a diverse cultural ambience, she added.

If Canada is welcoming international students in large numbers, the UK remains one of the most-desired destinations by Indian students. “In the UK, you can learn from the best in the field. The cutting-edge learning broadens students’ perspectives, also building their self-confidence tremendously,” said Richard Homer, Chief Operating Officer, British Deputy High Commission, Bengaluru.

Engineers in Japan

“From Buddhism, Sanskrit to music, Japan shares a lot in common with India. And there have been thousands of IT engineers from India working in Tokyo since last few decades,” observed Takayuki Kitagawa, Japanese Consul General in Bengaluru.

As Japan is an ageing society, automation and robotics will be given high preference in the country in the coming years according to him. “That requires us to hire professionals from the global workforce. There is a shortage of around 2 lakh IT engineers in Japan,” he informed. Apart from the IT sector, healthcare, manufacturing and transport sectors would also be looking for skilled workers, he added.

But studying in Japan would require a student to pass Japanese proficiency test and likewise, most German universities demand proficiency in German language. An alumnus of Christ university, who did her Japanese language course in Tokyo, shared her experience of learning the new language and its advantages at the seminar. She also answered questions from the audience regarding cost of living, student life and more in Tokyo.

Do thorough research

Explaining the student-application process to Canadian universities, Mathew, Head of student visas explained: “First figure out where you want to go in Canada and be clear from the beginning whether you’re going alone or with spouse/ children as cost of living would vary to a great extent. But unlike other countries, Canada provides open work permit to your spouse while you’re studying.”

He advised students to do a thorough research of the programmes, universities and go through the application process themselves without completely relying on their consultants as many a times they do not fully understand students’ preferences. Canadian visa would take up to 30 working days and requires acceptance letter from a Canadian university, proof of required test certificates, transcripts, receipt of college fee, medical report, study permit and bank balance as prescribed by the visa office.

Co-curricular activities

According to Ramya Ashok, Education USA, students must make a list of universities they want to study in, and this should be according to what fits them. “For this, know your requirements first. Is it climate or proximity to the industry that is crucial to you? Pick universities accordingly,” she advised.

“What you have done outside the classroom adds tremendous weightage to your application and therefore do not neglect the co-curricular activity section while filling up your application,” she emphasised.

Although a student cannot work in the US unlike in other countries during his/her studies, the country provides various arrangements for students to gain practical experience during and after their respective programmes.

“If CPT (Curricular Practical Training) provides students hands on experience during their degree, the OPT (Optional Practical Training) allows graduates to work as trainees after their studies,” mentioned Ramya.

If some students felt that the seminar was highly informative, others were glad to receive authentic details from various consulates directly.

Today at REVA University

On Tuesday, the event will be held at REVA University, Rukmini Knowledge Park, Kattigenahalli, Yelahanka, from 10.30 a.m. to 4 p.m. There will be no seminars, and students can directly interact with representatives of universities and clarify their doubts.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qhqw5g/article30670079.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bgexpojpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/students-aiming-to-study-abroad-must-figure-out-their-priorities-first/article30670082.ece
402,2020/01/28,10-ft railing installed on Seshadri Road to control protests,"Concrete blocks about two feet in height serve as road divider on the busy Seshadri Road. In front of Freedom Park, where most protests are held in the city, 10-ft-high metal railings have been installed on top of the concrete blocks.

This, according to the police, is to ensure that traffic is not affected on the arterial road when rallies are taken out.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) B. Ramesh told The Hindu that the police had recommended that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) install the railing to ensure that traffic on both lanes on the major road is not blocked. “Protest rallies that are taken out from the railway station to Freedom Park often have several hundreds of participants. Once traffic is blocked on this road, vehicular movement in the entire Central Business District takes a hit,” he said, adding that with the railing in place, the police could ensure that protesters stuck to one lane, meaning traffic on the other lane is left undisturbed.

BBMP officials confirmed that the railings had been installed following a request from the police. An official from the civic body’s projects division told The Hindu that the railings would be installed till the underpass cutting across Seshadri Road. “For pedestrians, there is a skywalk. It has been installed in public interest,” he said.

Traffic expert Ashish Verma admitted that he had never seen such railings installed on any road anywhere in the world. He said they could have implications in terms of safety. “Before such interventions, due consideration should be given to the safety of pedestrians, road safety and traffic management. This is a rigid and heavy barrier. Unless it has reflective tapes or paint, it may not be easily visible in the glare of headlights. Also, the shadow effect will have to be taken into consideration,” he said, adding that the civic authorities may be solving one problem and creating another.

He said that concrete blocks as road dividers were also not desirable. He also pointed out the lack of safe pedestrian crossing on the stretch.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dvzfmi/article30670045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGFREEDOMPARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/10-ft-railing-installed-on-seshadri-road-to-control-protests/article30670046.ece

“Dumping of medical waste in a water body is a serious offence, affecting the health of the people. Such things will not be allowed to continue. Persons responsible for the same must be dealt with seriously and they must be liable to pay environmental compensation as well and that compensation must be deterrent in nature and also non profitable to industry so as to deter from committing such mischiefs in future,” the Bench said.

The Bench of Justice K. Ramakrishnan and judicial member Saibal Dasgupta said it must be a message to others to comply with the Rules scrupulously, prevent pollution and provide a clean and green environment, thereby making the polluters understand their fundamental duty enshrined in Article 51 A of the Constitution of India.

The Bench directed the TNPCB to also find out if the pharma companies have the necessary consent to operate under the Air and Water Act.

“If they are do not have such consent, then as directed by this Tribunal, they are at liberty to take action against those persons who are running such units without necessary consent and conditions and submit a report immediately regarding the same to this Tribunal,” the Bench said.

The Bench said the TNPCB was at liberty to constitute any expert committee for assessing the compensation, if the dumping of medical waste had resulted in deterioration of soil and water and also specify remedial measures to be taken by them to restore the same to its original position. It also asked the Board to submit before the Tribunal regarding the status of prosecution launched against the violatore.

The case relates to dumping of medical waste into the Puzhal Lake in 2017. It was said that sewage was being discharged into the lake through storm water drains without treating it. The Bench took up the matter suo moto based on a report that medical waste, including medicines and tablets of which expiry period was over and biomedical waste from various hospitals in the city and suburbs were being dumped at the Thirumullaivoyal side of the lake in tonnes by some miscreants.

He added, “There are employees who die while on the job. In such cases the government should give compensation and also provide government jobs for their family members. Currently, Tasmac shops across the State don’t have toilet facilities. We want the Tasmac officials to look into this,” he said.

The office-bearers of the Association also said that the government is closing Tasmac shops, which is a good move, but the employees working at these shops should be redeployed at other outlets.

In an attempt to help children grasp and understand concepts better, STEPapp, an educational gaming app has been launched. Eduisfun Technologies has approached the State government and made a proposal to launch this app in government schools so that children will be keen to learn maths and sciences concepts faster.

Karthikeyan, of EduisFun, said the games have been developed based on ICSE, State Board and CBSE curriculum; since most children are glued to games, this way of reaching out will work well and they will be interested in learning maths and science concepts. When they finish each lesson by playing and winning the game, they can move forward to the next lesson, he added.

The STEPapp has been designed in such a way that it can be played on the mobile or a computer; and it will help various types of learners too, he said.

“These are times when several students are finding it tough to crack NEET (medical entrance exam) because they may not have understood the concepts well.

The arterial road, stretching from Gurunanak College to the Checkpost Bus Stand, is so full of potholes that it is no longer possible to see any tar on the road. A long line of vehicles move at a snail-like pace for close to 30 minutes during rush hour just to traverse this stretch.

M. Harish, a resident of Gandhi Road in Velachery, complaining about the terrible condition of the road said that it was very difficult to use the stretch during peak hours. He rued that the road, being the only access road for motorists headed into the city, has been in this bad condition for more than five months.

The small stretch of the road has been dug up for the construction of stormwater drains, and when the motorists hoped the Chennai Corporation would take some steps to repair or pave the road again, the road was further damaged to install underground cable networks for a telecommunications company.

Talking to reporters at the Chennai airport, he said that following bomb blasts in churches, the Sri Lankan government had banned face coverings in public places.

“If people are allowed to cover their faces, it is difficult to determine whether they are Hindus or Christians or Muslims or terrorists,” the former Union Minister said. His remarks come against the backdrop of the murder of a BJP functionary in Tiruchi, an incident which, according to the police, occurred due to “personal enmity”.

Mr. Radhakrishnan alleged that the DMK and the Congress were interested only in securing the votes of Muslims and Christians, while choosing to divide Hindus on religious and caste lines.

Though the DMK had claimed it had condemned the killing of SSI Wilson in Kanniyakumari, the party’s MLAs did not raise the issue in the Assembly, he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wtmytx/article30670249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28PONRADHAKRISHNANINRAMANATHAPURAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pon-radhakrishnan-seeks-ban-on-covering-of-faces/article30670250.ece

In a statement, Mr. Vasan said, “When a person doesn’t pay EMI for 90 days, he or she is added to the defaulters’ list. They end up not being able to avail themselves of any other loan, and the banks also indulge in certain activities to collect loan repayments from them. The Central government should look at revising the norms.”

Mr. Vasan said sometimes, people are unable to pay back their loans in time due to economic hardship or poor business.

“This [90-day] time period should be increased to six months. Also, public sector banks should give loans to people above 60 years of age. They should look at their income, assets etc. to give them loans so that business will increase,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/brjblc/article30670233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28GKVASANATDINDIGUL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/psbs-should-increase-loan-repayment-tenure-vasan/article30670234.ece

411,2020/01/28,Perarivalan urges Governor to expedite decision on mercy plea,"A.G. Perarivalan, one of the life convicts in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination case, has urged Governor Banwarilal Purohit to expedite the decision on his mercy plea.

The convict, lodged in the Puzhal central prison, wrote to the Governor a few days after the Supreme Court directed the Tamil Nadu government last Tuesday to file a report on the status of his plea for pardon. The apex court had called for the status report after expressing its displeasure over the lack of progress made by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on determining whether the assassination of the former Prime Minister was the culmination of a “larger conspiracy”.

In his letter dated January 25, 2020, Perarivalan said he had submitted an application under Article 161 of the Constitution on December 30, 2015, and since no decision was taken on it, the Supreme Court had, on September 6, 2018, directed the authority concerned to decide on the mercy petition. Accordingly, the Council of Ministers of Tamil Nadu, on September 9, 2018, made a recommendation to the Governor that remission of sentence be granted.

The convict said he had received no intimation from the Raj Bhavan on the status of his mercy petition, despite having sent several reminders. In the backdrop of the Supreme Court asking for the status report, the life convict appealed to the Governor to consider the ‘unique’ aspects in his case and ensure that the decision/recommendation of the Council of Ministers was duly acted upon and communicated to the apex court.

Among the aspects of his case that he highlighted to the Governor were the points that he had been incarcerated for 29 years, including 24 years in solitary confinement; he had exhibited good conduct throughout his time in prison; and he had completed undergraduation and postgraduation in Computer Applications and obtained eight Diploma and Certificate courses while in prison, among others.

Perarivalan specifically mentioned that the then Superintendent of Police, CBI, V. Thiagarajan, who was part of the Special Investigation Team that probed the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, had admitted in an affidavit before the Supreme Court that he did not record his exculpatory statement.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9numeg/article30670190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28AGPERARIVALAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/perarivalan-urges-governor-to-expedite-decision-on-mercy-plea/article30670191.ece

413,2020/01/28,"Judge concerned over ‘purchase’ of law degrees, sanctity of profession","Justice N. Kirubakaran of the Madras High Court on Monday said courts were crowded by way of too many “lawyers” only because of activities of people like a law college principal who was arrested recently for having created fake attendance records and issuing bona fide certificates to students in a fraudulent manner to get them enrolled as lawyers in the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

Presiding over a Division Bench along with Justice V. Parthiban, the senior judge said those who “purchase” law degrees without attending college, end up conducting kangaroo courts. The infusion of such individuals affected genuine lawyers who had undergone three-year and five-year full-time law courses with the fond hope of making it big in the profession, and end up spoiling the sanctity of the profession, he said.

The judge made the observations during the hearing of a batch of cases related to those who had reportedly obtained degrees from Andhra Pradesh from where the law college principal Himavantha Kumar was arrested, and were serving as guest lecturers in law colleges here. The judges ordered that all relevant details regarding such people should be submitted in the court by the next date of hearing so that necessary action could be taken.

Earlier, K. Balu, member of BCTNP, told the judge that the principal was arrested on the basis of the complaint lodged by the bar council. The Greater Chennai police had visited Kadapa, made inquiries and then arrested him, he said.

Later, taking up another case related to alleged lack of infrastructure facilities at the government law college campuses at Pudupakkam in Kancheepuram district and Tiruvalangadu in Tiruvallur district, the judges directed Additional Advocate-General Narmadha Sampath to file a detailed report by next month on the number of free bus passes issued to students, details of police booths near the campus and the mobile phone towers installed at the vicinity.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/judge-concerned-over-purchase-of-law-degrees-sanctity-of-profession/article30670153.ece
414,2020/01/28,HC takes note of ‘discrimination’ in cash awards to paralympians,"The Madras High Court has summoned Member Secretary, Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT), to explain why only select individuals are awarded the cash prize ranging between ₹10 lakh and ₹2 crore each for their achievements in Silent Olympics, Special Olympics and Paralympics, while others are denied such largesse.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan directed the Member Secretary to be present in the court on February 11. The direction was issued on a writ petition filed by the mother of a 26-year-old autistic athlete who had won the gold in 100-metre sprint and the bronze in long jump in the Special Olympics World Summer Games held in Los Angeles in 2015.

The petitioner M. Santhanalakshmi, a daily wager from Otteri in Chennai, claimed that the State government paid her son M. Platni Maran only ₹50,000 for having won the gold medal and ₹ 20,000 for the bronze, while it paid several lakhs and even a few crores of rupees to select athletes for similar achievements.

Her counsel S.S. Rajesh brought it to the notice of the court that the petitioner’s family was living in penury and struggling a lot to take care of the autistic athlete. The youngster dropped out of school in Class VI. However, since he was good in track and field events, the parents encouraged him to participate in those events.

After his achievements at the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games, the Centre honoured him with a cash award of ₹6 lakh, but the State government did not pay anything more than ₹70,000, which was not even sufficient to cover his travel expenses for the Special Olympics held in the US between July 25 and August 2, 2015.

Several representations

The petitioner and her husband made several representations since 2015 seeking better monetary rewards as well as a government job for their son but to no avail.

Meanwhile, the government in 2016 paid ₹2 crore to T. Mariyappan, who had won the gold in high jump by leaping a height of 1.89 metres at the Paralympics held in Rio De Janeiro.

Again in 2017, it paid ₹10 lakh to one Balu Pandian who won the silver in floor hockey in Special Olympics World Winter Games held in South Korea in 2013. Wondering why select athletes alone were awarded with cash prizes, Mr. Rajesh said it was highly discriminatory on the part of the government to deny such a benefit to an autistic athlete.

In a counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Youth Welfare and Sports Development Secretary, the department’s Deputy Secretary M.S. Chitra stated that the two athletes referred to by the writ petitioner were awarded cash incentives as special cases and such payments could not be cited by others as a precedent to claim similar incentives.

A Government Order issued in December 2005 provides for a cash reward of ₹50,000 for the gold medal, ₹30,000 for silver, ₹20,000 for bronze and ₹1,000 for participation in Silent Olympics, Special Olympics and Paralympics. Accordingly, the petitioner’s son was paid ₹70,000 for his gold and bronze medals in the Special Olympics.

“Whatever grant of award, as permitted in the rules in force, has been awarded to the petitioner’s son and any special grant of cash award or employment opportunity or any other recognition cannot be claimed as a matter of right,” the Deputy Secretary added.

Not satisfied with such an explanation, the judge summoned the SDAT Member Secretary.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-takes-note-of-discrimination-in-cash-awards-to-paralympians/article30670099.ece
415,2020/01/28,Court calls for details of all illegal buildings on ECR,"The Madras High Court on Monday directed the Coastal Zone Management Authority (CZMA) to submit by Wednesday details of the number of bungalows and other buildings constructed in the high tide zone, intertidal zone and no development zone along the Bay of Bengal on East Coast Road (ECR) here.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha said since they had ordered demolition of one of the bungalows on a stretch last week, known as Olive Island, in Muttukadu Taluk on ECR for having been constructed on the no development zone, they wanted to know details of other such illegal constructions too.

The judges directed Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan to produce the details of the unauthorised constructions along with photographs as well as Google maps to pinpoint their exact location since the building they had ordered to be demolished appeared to be almost inside the Bay of Bengal. The direction was issued during the hearing of a batch of cases related to unauthorised constructions on the beach front in ECR.

Amicus Curiae T. Mohan told the court that 728 building owners were issued notices after a joint inspection by Greater Chennai Corporation and Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority a couple of years ago.

Out of them, only around 450 approached the court to explain their standpoint. Since the rest had not bothered to approach the court, the Corporation should have gone ahead and demolished all those buildings after following the due process of law under the relevant statutes, Mr. Mohan said.

Concurring with him, the senior judge in the Bench wondered why the Corporation had not acted against the violators of Coastal Regulatory Zone regulations.

“Do you need court orders even to perform your duties. Why do you always want to shoot from our shoulders? Why don’t you act,” he asked the Corporation counsel.

Earlier in the day, the judges took up for admission a new case filed by J. Sundar, a resident of Kovalam, to demolish the constructions being put up by BMR Industries Private Limited in Muttukadu.

Mr. Manoharan told the court that the CZMA officials had already inspected the premises, reportedly used as a hatchery, and their report was awaited.

After noting down his submissions, the judges directed the SGP to report by February 6 the status of the constructions and whether it was being constructed illegally in a prohibited zone.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/court-calls-for-details-of-all-illegal-buildings-on-ecr/article30670051.ece
416,2020/01/28,Boom barrier on public road removed,"The Chennai Corporation on Monday removed a metal boom barrier that was blocking entry to Bharathi Avenue in Injambakkam.

Officials said that the barrier blocked entry of the public to the road that leads to the beach from the East Coast Road and that they had received an online complaint about the barrier.

They said that public roads cannot be closed or barricaded in any manner, preventing the entry of the public.

“A few years ago, locals had wanted a barrier to prevent bike racing on the road to the beach and also to prevent thefts since the houses were placed far and apart. The Chennai Corporation officials at that point of time allowed the barrier after police concurrence, but with the condition that it should be kept closed only at night and that too with a watchman. They were not permitted to keep it closed in the daytime,” said an official.

The Corporation officials said that if there are other such barriers that are kept closed during the day and denying access to public roads, they would be removed.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6cas6k/article30670012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THBOOMBARRIER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/boom-barrier-on-public-road-removed/article30670013.ece
417,2020/01/28,Three more lakes to be turned into eco-parks in Chennai,"What started as a voluntary effort of residents to spruce up Vengaivasal Periyaeri near Medavakkam last year has now turned into a government-funded eco-restoration project. The lake is among three waterbodies that will soon be rejuvenated on the lines of Paruthipattu lake near Avadi.

The Water Resources Department will take up eco-restoration of Vengaivasal Periyaeri, Perumbakkam and Adambakkam by March at a cost of ₹12 crore.

A government order recently sanctioned the funds under the Environment Protection and Renewable Energy Development Fund of Environment and Forests Department. Residents of Vengaivasal said they constructed a recharge well in the lake to tackle water scarcity last summer through crowd-funding. The well in the lake continues to supply nearly 3-4 lakh litres of water. Welcoming the project, residents said that it would improve the lake’s storage capacity and also serve as a recreational space. T.Senthil Kumar, a resident of Santhosapuram, Vengaivasal, said, “We crowd-sourced funds of nearly ₹30 lakh to construct the recharge well and also desilted another lake, Chitteri. We continue to volunteer to collect trash from the lake that is a haven for birds.”

The project would help recharge the groundwater table and reduce water shortage in the locality. “The department must also take action to prevent sewage being released from areas like Madambakkam into Chitteri through inlet channels. A sewage treatment plant must be constructed as assured by officials earlier,” he demanded.

Residents also wanted the district administration to regulate timing of groundwater extraction from agricultural wells in Vengaivasal to prevent threat of plummeting water table depletion of groundwater.

Perumbakkam lake, spread over 560 acres, is already being developed as a drinking water source by Chennai Metrowater. It will be beautified at a cost of ₹4.8 crore through the project.

On the desilting of the Adambakkam lake, C.R. Balaji, a resident of Mandaveli, said sewage discharge through stormwater drains and other sources must be arrested. Nearly ₹4 crore will be spent on restoration of Adambakkam and Vengaivasal lakes. This would include desilting, improving storage capacity by a minimum of 10%, reconstruction of damaged weirs and sluices, creating children’s play area and building of mounds in the lakes for bird nesting space. Besides fencing the foreshore area and laying footpaths, saplings would be planted on the bund. Measures are being taken to prevent sewage pollution in the lakes, said officials of the WRD.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/owies/article30669986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THPERUMBAKKAMLAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/three-more-lakes-to-be-turned-into-eco-parks/article30669987.ece
418,2020/01/28,Mental health professionals to be linked with schools in the city,"Mental health of the young has started to gain prominence in the last few years. To create access to help at the school-level, the World Psychiatric Association (WPA), citiesRISE and Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) have come together to build the capacity of mental health professionals and link them to schools in the city.

In a first step towards this, 32 psychiatrists, psychologists and psychiatric social workers are taking part in a two-day “Practice Transformation Workshop”. Though many schools still do not have counsellors, institutions are beginning to understand the importance of focussing on the mental health needs of students.

Helen Herrman, president of WPA, said there was a great need for early intervention at the school-level. “It is important for schools, mental health professionals and the system to come together. We have seen that a mentally healthy child can learn better, be happier at school and interact better with each others. All this produces better learning outcomes,” she said. She added that a whole-school approach to mental health was essential.

“We are working on youth mental health for more than five years, and this is a continuation of that effort. “Mental health problems in youth and adolescents are much higher in Tamil Nadu than many other States. This is top priority for us. We are building the capacity of mental health professionals, and our aim is to create a school mental health group in Chennai through which they can be liaised with schools to enhance mental health of the young. This will be an on-going process,” said R. Thara, vice chairperson of SCARF.

M. Suresh Kumar, technical lead, citiesRISE, said they were embarking on a whole-school approach by training teachers and parents, and constituting resilient teams to help children and provide low threshold intervention in a school setting. With a curriculum developed by SCARF, the mental health professionals are being trained on assessment and management of common mental health problems among schoolchildren. “Schoolchildren may have problems such as refusal to go to school, relationship dynamics within peers, academic pressures and distress due to family conflicts,” he said. Post-training, these professionals would be geographically linked to 30 schools — mostly Chennai Corporation schools. The resilient teams of schools would be linked with the mental health professionals, he mentioned.

One of the participants,Yamini Kannappan, consultant psychiatrist, Kauvery Hospitals, and said mental health of youth was one of the current challenges considering their vulnerability, high suicide rates and mental health problems. “We need a structured framework for school mental health interventions,” she said. Vimal, senior assistant professor, Department of Child Psychiatry, Institute of Child Health, said, “Till now, we have had the hospital-based approach and care. We need to go to the schools, identify issues early and treat in the school.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/1u3rvi/article30669951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THHELENHERRMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mental-health-professionals-to-be-linked-with-schools-in-the-city/article30669952.ece
419,2020/01/28,Tunnelling machines to arrive for Metro work,"Soon, tunnel boring machines (TBM) will crawl through the city’s underbelly to lay two tracks side by side for Chennai Metro’s phase II work.

According to CMRL officials, as many as 15 TBMs will arrive in the city from different parts of the country and the world to build 21 km of tunnels from Madhavaram to Taramani for the phase II project.

The TBMs will be deployed at multiple locations in this 21-km stretch and will bore two passages for train movement, officials said. These machines can weigh nearly 800-900 tonnes, with a length of 80-90 m. That is, if a TBM stood vertically, it will be like a 25-storey building, officials said.

These machines will drill about 5 m a day, which may also be much lesser if the soil conditions are challenging. In the phase I project, only 12 machines were employed for 24 km. For phase II, more TBMs will be used to finish the job early, the officials said.

After the machines arrive, it will take nearly six months to carry out initial preparatory work to launch the TBMs and then the actual boring work will begin, officials note.

“The geological conditions of the city are difficult to execute the underground boring work. But we have done soil testing in most locations and have planned it in such a way that we stick to the deadline and finish the work as early as possible. We are hoping that the whole tunnelling work will be over for these 21 km in two years,” an official said. Only recently, tenders were called for building the tunnels for the phase II project. In two months, the CMRL will award two contracts — one for constructing a tunnel from Madhavaram to Kellys and another from Kellys till Taramani, officials said. Afterwards, the CMRL will float tenders to execute the building of stations along this stretch.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tunnelling-machines-to-arrive-for-metro-work/article30669925.ece
420,2020/01/28,Street vendors to get space in shopping complexes,"Street vendors may get their own space from the Chennai Corporation in areas where the civic body owns shopping complexes.

In the 152 shopping complexes with 6,190 shops managed by the Corporation, more than 50% of the shops are in a dilapidated state. Such shopping complexes may soon be redeveloped for offering space to street vendors.

The Corporation has already announced that the dilapidated shops are unsafe for pedestrians and motorists. “We have issued notices to the occupants, explaining that the structure may collapse any time,” said an official.

The civic body is planning to use a portion of the redeveloped space in the shopping complexes to protect the livelihood of street vendors. Over 40,000 street vendors have already been identified. “We have issued identity cards to the street vendors,” said an official.

For example, in ward 134 of Kodambakkam zone, the Corporation shopping complex on N.S.K. Salai is dilapidated. The civic body has asked allottees to vacate and has proposed to construct a new building in the land measuring 2,942 sq. m. The complex was constructed in 1971 with 38 shops in the ground floor. In 1985, the complex was expanded to accommodate 38 shops in the first floor and 35 shops in the second.

The Corporation also constructed 86 additional shops at Gandhi Market. In 2011, the Chairman of Ward Committee had given a letter to the Zonal Officer, stating that the complex on N.S.K. Salai needs to be demolished. The committee also recommended reconstruction of the complex, suggesting allocation of the remaining land to vendors.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7bcf42/article30669901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th28vendorcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/street-vendors-to-get-space-in-shopping-complexes/article30669902.ece
421,2020/01/28,Chennai Corporation begins work to recarpet damaged roads,"The Chennai Corporation has kick-started work on relaying damaged roads across the city.

Paving machines have been stationed at key stretches such as Nelson Manickam Road and G.N. Chetty Road, as well as in areas such as Anna Nagar, Velachery, Villivakkam and Adyar.

“Machines have been despatched to 50 locations. Work will begin this week,” said an official.

Many of the roads that were damaged for Metrowater projects will also be restored.

In addition to the work on major bus route roads, the Corporation has also started preparing to relay more than 4,000 damaged roads at an estimated at ₹700 crore.

The Corporation has already received aproval of ₹338 crore for restoring damaged roads under the Tamilnadu Urban Roads Infrastructure Programme (TURIP) 2019-20.

The project would improve roads damaged on account of underground sewerage and water supply improvement schemes as well as natural calamities.

Approval has been accorded by the project sanctioning committee of TURIP. Last year, the Corporation submitted a proposal for the relaying of bus route roads and interior roads, damaged because of the execution of improvements to footpaths and development of cycle tracks.

TURIP’s grant of ₹120 crore and a contribution of ₹100 crore by the Chennai Corporation was also finalised, with the condition that the Corporation Council’s resolution should be obtained before calling for tenders and a common model for bid documents should be adopted while calling for them. The work was delayed because of the monsoon.

The civic body would also engage a project monitoring consultant by following due procedures as per the Tamil Nadu Transparency in Tenders Act, 1998, officials said.

In addition to road relaying, the Special Projects Department of Chennai Corporation will develop infrastructure for promoting non-motorised transport. “Smart street redevelopment in areas such as Burkit Road is an example. The estimate for a smart street along Burkit Road is ₹6.38 crore,"" said an official.

Most of the bus route roads, interior roads and footpaths are expected to get a makeover in three months, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ddidna/article30669875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th28ridecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-corporation-begins-work-to-recarpet-damaged-roads/article30669876.ece
422,2020/01/28,Retrieving the idea of citizenship,"The 70th Republic Day has ushered in lyrical constitutionalism of a kind never witnessed before in the history of independent India. It has also ushered in the full-blooded emergence of the constitutional commons as the space for a public, shared, collectively crafted jurisprudence of citizenship. Conversations on citizenship draw upon the rich tapestry of the Preamble and the echoes it contains, bringing people together in ways that shine a torch on the pathways to a transformative jurisprudence for our constitutional courts.

It is not anymore that the people of this country falter in their steps towards courts to seek justice; it is courts that even while reciting the Constitution, are unable to take definitive positions, unfettered by governmental dispositions.

When I suggested in 2012 in Tools of Justice that transformative constitutionalism is by definition insurgent, I had not in fact imagined that we would witness an insurgency of these proportions that carry forth rhythm, sight, sound, musicality, tenacity, constitutional wisdom, collective action and the redefinition of leadership (in terms of caste, religion, gender, class and age especially) in quite this manner in the face of threat, governance by fear, and the perpetual anticipation of terror.

Just the demonstration of the possibility of this resistance is deeply transformative and moving. Will India and Indian-ness ever be the same again?

Ways of the Right

The ways of the Hindu Right are cruel and ruthless beyond measure, disregardful of the rule of law, and utterly anti-national, the‘national’ defined in broad inclusive terms of ‘upholding the spirit of the Constitution and respecting its fundamental tenets.’ We have seen demonstration of that as well — especially in Kashmir and Assam, also in Uttar Pradesh, not to speak of the violence on university campuses. Against the brutal reign of terror, and threat of more to come, against a future that seems bleak on every score — employment, economy, education (especially higher education), and governance — it is the public and spirited defence of the constitutional commons that has forced accountability on the state and internationalised its depredations.

The recitations of resistance range from wresting the national anthem from its empty ritualistic performance by military bands or the ritual flag-hoisting on Republic Day and Independence Day, to reinstalling the tricolour as a symbol of resistance. Recitations of resistance combine Faiz with the Preamble in the voice of Chandrashekhar Azad on the steps of Jama Masjid before he is arrested for inciting violence. The phrase ‘incitement to violence’ itself acquires a new meaning in the national space of this resistance — the recitation of the Preamble incites the state to violence, forcing a judge to ask the state, ‘What offence? Tell me. He’ll read the Preamble?’

Extrapolating from the ideas of Nobel Laureate Elinor Ostrom and scholars of the commons, the conceptualisation of the Constitution as a commons opens it out to radical, insurgent readings that redefine belonging and ownership — it is no longer the property of state, legislatures and courts to (mis)interpret in the service of political expediency/judicial bias/equivocation. It is the people who through collective action and civic engagement hold institutions to account and provide the tools and experiences that must shape constitutional interpretation. The Preamble sets out the spirit of constitutional morality (not its narrow prescription) that guides an understanding of protections set out within. It also makes intelligible to people the legislative, judicial or executive action that undermine the spirit of the Constitution.

For this public engagement is a justice cascade to borrow from Kathryn Sikkink, that will not (does not) stop with the recitation — it has forced the government into courts and has forced judicial deliberation on the reach of constitutional protections to discipline the state. Although we see a marked pushback from the spectacular position of the right to privacy judgment in 2017 — with no effective reliefs granted in the Kashmir cases and a deferral on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or CAA, 2019, among others — it is institutions of justice that are now on trial. This is the singular achievement of this historic moment: the rupture of a sequestered ‘constitutional jurisprudence’ through the articulation of an expansive, inclusive constitutional commons and the performance of lyrical constitutionalism.

Freedoms as birthright

This insurgency also holds a unique pedagogic moment: it demonstrates a different way of imagining the Constitution and a different understanding of citizenship. In her recent work, Birthright Citizens, African-American legal historian Martha Jones argues that citizenship is distinct from and deeper than political rights or voting alone, and embedded in birthright (as African Americans argued long before they belonged equally in the Constitution). In our context, we must ask, what is birthright? Is it swaraj (freedom or azaadi that has distinct cadences deriving from location)? Is it the elimination of untouchability (as Dr. Ambedkar observed)?

Is birthright embedded in the undisturbed right of forest dwellers to the forest commons — Maava Naate Maava Raaj (our village, our governance), as Dr. Jaipal Singh Munda had argued for in the Constituent Assembly deliberations? Or is birthright embedded deep within the right to dignity and self-respect of losatravesados, the migrants, the crossers that Gloria Anzaldúa speaks of in her stunning work on borderlands? Is it all of this? For after all, as Martha Jones observes pertinently, “sometimes citizenship was defined in constitutions and statutes, most of the time it was not”. Certainly, citizenship by any definition is not a dole to be handed out by rulers to compliant subjects nor is its grant an alms deed to be distributed at whim.

Since the conversation has now opened up to critical public deliberation, how would we draw constitutionscapes across the rugged terrains of azaadi? The Constitution itself recognises various levels of azaadi, lest we forget. The late B.D. Sharma famously called the Fifth Schedule ‘a Constitution within a Constitution’; prior to August 5, 2019, the Constitution of India recognised the Constitution of the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Areas under the Sixth Schedule in northeast India similarly have constitutional guarantees of autonomy.

The guarantees of azaadi to Dalits under the Constitution are unprecedented. Although each of these is only observed in the breach, mapping constitutionscapes in their specific figurations means keeping these firmly at the centre of debate and collective action. Witness its signposts: Chandrashekhar Azad, the dadis of Shaheen Bagh, the Ghanta Ghar resisters in Lucknow, resistance as withdrawal by the people of Kashmir, campuses, Kerala’s challenge to the constitutionality of CAA, the proxy strikes on conscientious resisters, the shutdown of Jammu and Kashmir, incarceration in detention camps and the proliferation of camps, the deferral by constitutional courts, the languages of rule and resistance, and indeed the languages of jurisprudence trapped in a chokehold that defers the pronouncement of freedom as birthright.

The re-instatement of this experience and ways of knowing interwoven with a resurgent public constitutionalism, might help us reclaim the idea of citizenship as birthright and inscribe the constitutional commons by “occupying” them and establishing a shared, collective, inclusive ownership.

423,2020/01/28,Despatched to NIA,"The pre-emptive move by the Centre to transfer the Elgar Parishad cases to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) effectively means that the arrested activists will remain confined to their prison cells for some more time. The activists themselves would much prefer to be exonerated by a court than to owe their freedom and liberty to a fortuitous change in the composition of the State government. The cases bristle with many infirmities and appear prima facie to be built more on conjecture than any tangible evidence. How long the NIA would take to complete its investigations is anybody’s guess. Surely, the cases do not speak well of a justice delivery system that commits its citizens to the rigours of an extended jail term without giving them the benefit of a fair and speedy trial or even bail (Editorial, “Dubious decision,” Jan. 27).

424,2020/01/28,"Adopted, and returned","It is really a cause for concern to note that many adopted children in India are being returned at an advanced stage (Front page, “It’s a long road for these adopted children,” Jan. 27). There is an urgent need to ensure effective sensitisation and prior counselling to parents desirous of adopting children. Adoption centres may also conduct preparatory grooming sessions. Post adoption, periodic monitoring is required. The existing legal framework may also be expanded to include “acclimatisation period” for both parties. This would prevent, to a large extent, rejection at an advanced stage. Adoption centres may also utilise the services of clinical psychologists. Further, it would be prudent to introduce capability and compatibility assessment, including in cases where the adopting entity is a single parent.

425,2020/01/28,Blacklisting Pakistan,"Pakistan may escape blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) due to China’s backing and, also, some tactical support from the West. This should make India reflect on its strategy to curb Pakistan’s terror financing. An important thing to keep in mind here is that the FATF does not always work on the basis of merit of the task at hand and there is always an element of the political consideration that comes into play when such decisions are made. Beijing considers Islamabad an all-weather ally. A lot of Pakistan’s debt is owed to China and blacklisting by the FATF could affect Islamabad’s ability to repay. Similarly, the U.S. needs Pakistan in its Afghan withdrawal policy. Hence, rather than being dependent on the FATF, India needs to improve its own economic standing in such a way that a fear of retribution from New Delhi is enough to dissuade major powers from offering assistance to Pakistan.

426,2020/01/28,Public awareness of Constitution,"One good thing that the Constitution Amendment Act (CAA) has done to the country, if it can be so phrased, is that it has made more and more people aware of the existence of the Constitution, a book like no other that defines and governs our existence as a united nation. It is apt to call it the ‘national book’. It has been elevated to the status of a ‘holy book’ by none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Preamble encapsulates the essence of the Constitution and India’s genius. Reading it in public rallies is an affirmation of the notions of liberty, equality and fraternity and an acknowledgement of the Constitution as the foundation on which the Republic stands and as a talisman that keeps the nation of disparate races and religions together.

There is also an emotional reason for holding the Constitution close to our hearts. The Constitution embodies the wisdom, creativity and imagination of B.R. Ambedkar (Chairman of the Drafting Committee) and other members of the Constituent Assembly. It is evocative of the heartbeat of the mass of humanity inhabiting the sub-continent. We are enormously grateful to the makers of the Constitution.

We are inheritors of B.R. Ambedkar’s legacy. We all treasure and cherish the Constitution and justice and freedom that run through it; we are also obliged to protect it from being altered or tinkered with for ourselves and posterity. Reading the Preamble in schools is bound to shape the world-view of children at an impressionable age. That it is made mandatory in schools in some states is welcome.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Cabinet colleagues will do themselves and the country a world of good by reading the Preamble and Articles: 14 to 35 of the Constitution and show fidelity to them rather than expending their time and energy on denigrating them. Since the CAA is irreconcilable with the Constitution, the Modi government must rescind the law rigorously questioned for its constitutionality.

427,2020/01/28,Unsung heroes honoured,"The selection of this year’s recipients of the Padma awards exhibits a marked departure from past practices and trends. Instead of honouring the celebrities and the famous who have already achieved fame and high social status, the government has chosen beneficiaries who have unobtrusively made an impact in various walks of life. These unsung heroes like, for example Tulasi Gowda, the tribal woman from Karnataka who mastered an encyclopaedic knowledge of herbs; Harekala Hajabba, the fruit vendor who devoted his life and earnings to educate others; Abdul Jabbar, who fought for the treatment and rehabilitation Bhopal gas tragedy victims; and Mohammad Sharif, the bicycle mechanic who has performed the last rites of thousands of unclaimed bodies, would have languished in obscurity without the nation getting to know about their selfless service to the society. By conferring the Padma awards on unheralded do-gooders, the state is not doing any favour to the latter, it is only acknowledging its debt to socially committed citizens for improving the lives of their compatriots without the expectations of fame and recognition.

The government’s gesture of honouring unacclaimed social activism has struck a blow for the spirit of republicanism and will inspire more people to engage in nation-building activities.

428,2020/01/28,Printed book matters,"It is inspiring to see that the 43rd Chennai Book Fair attracted huge crowds even on working days. This reiterates the fact that physical market for books will continue to grow despite the invasion of online portals and e-books. (Open Page, “If I were a book... all is fair,” Jan. 26). Though e-book readers have become a common sight, traditional books still have their evangelists. A printed book is way ahead of an e-book for a variety of reasons — the feel of the paper, its fragrance, sharing it with our loved ones, its images and illustrations, flexibility in annotation — all make a printed book much better and much sought after than an e-book. Needless to say, an e-book cannot compete with a printed book when it comes to the kind of amity and warmth the latter offers.

429,2020/01/28,Anyone from Pakistan can get Padma Shri by chanting ‘Jai Modi’: NCP,"Amid a row over Pakistani-origin singer Adnan Sami, who became an Indian citizen in 2016, being chosen for the Padma Shri, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Monday termed it an “insult” to 130 crore Indians and a “damage control” act by the NDA government “facing questions” over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Mr. Sami, born in London to a Pakistani Air Force veteran, applied for Indian citizenship in 2015 and became a citizen of the country in January 2016. He was one of the 118 people whose names were announced on Saturday for the Padma Shri awards, with the Ministry of Home Affairs list showing his home State as Maharashtra.

Maharashtra Minorities Development Minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik reacted to this, saying, “If anyone from Pakistan chants ‘Jai Modi’, he can now get citizenship of India as well as a Padma Shri award,” he said.

The NCP leader later tweeted that many Indian Muslims deserved the honours conferred by the country. “There are many Indian Muslims who deserve the honours conferred by our country. By giving #Padmashri to #Sami this current govt is trying to show that they are fair but in reality this is just a cover up to the problems they have created for large sections of Indian society (sic),” he tweeted.

430,2020/01/28,ED arrests DHFL promoter in probe into Iqbal Mirchi’s assets,"The Enforcement Directorate on Monday arrested Kapil Wadhawan, promoter of Dewan Housing Finance Limited, in connection with its ongoing investigations into the properties of deceased gangster Iqbal Mirchi.

The ED has been probing the money trail in several properties that Mirchi is believed to have bought in India from the proceeds of his illegal activities. Mirchi was alleged to be one of the top aides of wanted fugitive Dawood Ibrahim handling his drug running operations.

According to ED officers, Mr. Wadhawan was called in for questioning on Monday morning and grilled for several hours before being arrested around 5 p.m. He was also questioned in November last year.

“Custodial interrogation was deemed necessary when repeated questioning could not throw up satisfactory responses on DHFL’s association with Mirchi,” an ED officer said.

DHFL is alleged to have granted loans amounting to ₹2,186 crore to Sunblink Real Estate Pvt Ltd, which bought three properties in Mumbai from Mirchi in 2010. The same properties, according to the ED, was bought by Mirchi from the Mohammed Yusuf Trust, which was a front for his activities, in 1986.

“After buying the three properties, Mirchi systematically replaced all its occupants with tenants from his own family and friend circle before Sunblink bought them, supposedly for redevelopment purposes. The entire transaction was aimed at laundering Mirchi’s money,” another officer said.

Mr. Dewan is the fifth to be arrested by ED so far after Haroun Yusuf, Humayun Merchant, Ranjeet Bindra and Rinku Deshpande.

Mr. Yusuf, a British national and Mr. Merchant are alleged to be Mirchi’s aides, while Mr. Bindra and Ms. Deshpande acted as brokers and facilitators in the transactions.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/35mwo1/article30669909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMKAPILWADHAWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ed-arrests-dhfl-promoter-in-probe-into-iqbal-mirchis-assets/article30669910.ece
431,2020/01/28,Civil society activists urge State not to implement NPR,"Civil society activists on Monday demanded that the State government follow the lead of Kerala, Rajasthan and Punjab and issue a notification against the implementation of the National Population Register (NPR).

“I heard that Uddhav Thackeray had said mixing religion and politics has been a mistake. I would like to appeal to Mr. Thackeray to not allow NPR in the State,” student leader Umar Khalid said at an event organised by the Parcham Foundation on Monday. Mr. Khalid said it was now up to State governments not run by the Bharatiya Janata Party to join hands to stop the NPR, which will be implemented from April 1.

Farhan Azmi, president of the Parcham Foundation and son of Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi, said he would head to Ayodhya if Mr. Thackeray decided to make the trip on March 7.

He also accused Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad of hijacking the protests and called the Congress a ‘white ant’ that is eating into the government. “We do not think this government is going to last for six to eight months,” he said.

Gorakhpur-based paediatrician Dr. Kafeel Khan, actor Pooja Bhatt and former IPS officer Abdur Rahman also attended the event. “Every movement has heroes and the heroes of this one are the women,” Mr. Rahman said.

He termed the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) a black Act. He said he decided to quit his job after the legislation was passed in Parliament as he would have had to enforce it.

Dr. Khan said the government was bringing CAA as it did not fulfil its poll promises and wants to make people scapegoats like he was made for the death of 70 children in Gorakhpur. “The freedom struggle went on from 1857 to 1947. Even if we have to fight for 90 years, we will fight,” he said. Mr. Rahman said the fight was an existential one and if people had raised their voice against mob lynchings, they might not have had to wage this fight.

‘An Act that unites’

Ms. Bhatt said dissent was the greatest form of patriotism. “I would like to thank the ruling party because you haven’t divided us, you have united us,” she said.

Fahad Ahmad, student leader from Tata Institute of Social Sciences, said the government needs CAA to rule for another 50 years by disenfranchising those who are protesting.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cgniih/article30669800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMCONSTITUTIONALCONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/civil-society-activists-urge-state-not-to-implement-npr/article30669801.ece
432,2020/01/28,"To fight fund crunch, Aaditya Thackeray scraps BMC’s tours","Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray has ordered the cancellation of all trips of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) after corporators drew flak for planning costly study tours at a time when the civic body is facing a fund crunch.

The BMC’s improvement committee had planned a tour to Bengaluru and Mysuru; the education committee to Uttarakhand; the women and child welfare committee to Kerala; the works committee to Andaman and Nicobar Islands; and the Tree Authority to Singapore.

Shiv Sena leader Vishakha Raut said, “We have been conveyed that these trips have been cancelled, but we do not know the reason. It is possible that it was due to the fund crunch and the criticism in the media.”

A trip to China this month by the health committee, comprising the chairman, the Mayor and 35 corporators, has been called off due to the coronavirus outbreak. The committee members had planned to bear the cost of the visit as foreign tours require special sanction.

Last week, the BMC faced the ire of the opposition for putting forward a proposal to be the main sponsor of the 11th World Wilderness Congress in Jaipur from March 19 to 26, which will draw 25,000 visitors and 2,000 delegates from various countries. The BMC has proposed to spend ₹5 crore to showcase Mumbai’s biodiversity and heritage, and organise photography and short film contests. The exhibits would be later put on display at Byculla zoo.

The issue was not taken up for discussion last week and the BMC will be tabling the proposal again before the standing committee this week. The BMC will have to use its contingency fund to sponsor the event as the public relations department does not have enough funds.

Ravi Raja, Leader of the Opposition in the BMC, said, “If the study tours have been cancelled, why not cancel the Jaipur event too? Doesn’t the same logic apply there? Who is the administration trying to please by organising this event when we are facing a fund crunch?”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kpujle/article30669784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMAADITYATHACKERAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/to-fight-fund-crunch-aaditya-thackeray-scraps-bmcs-tours/article30669785.ece
433,2020/01/28,Vasant Raiji celebrates a unique century,"A century! That’s what every cricketer dreams of when he walks out to bat. In the nine first-class fixtures he has featured in, Vasant Raiji never scored a ton, but on Sunday, he scored a century in life.

Born on January 26, 1920, the oldest living Indian first-class cricketer turned 100, and his friends and family members ensured Raiji cherished the moment.

While there was a flurry of phone calls from across the world, former India captain Nari Contractor and Mumbai Cricket Association president Dr. Vijay Patil, visited Raiji at his Walkeshwar home. Mr. Contractor said, “He was a good cricketer. We have literally grown up watching him and his brother Madan Raiji. I may have been around 14, when I met him for the first time. I had gone to wish him on his birthday.” They cut a cake and talked cricket.

Marcus Couto, a first-class umpire, was also present at the assembly of friends and admirers. Having known Raiji for 37 years, Mr. Couto remembers him for his punctuality. “He was the most disciplined man I have ever met.” Playing first-class cricket for Bombay (as it was known then) and Baroda, Raiji had to join the family-run chartered accountancy firm, NM Raiji & Co. However, the love for the game never faded.

A man of words, he wrote quite a few books on cricketers such as Victor Trumper, C.K. Nayudu and L.P. Jai. He was also one of the founding members of Jolly Cricket Club in the city. Mr. Couto said, “He had one of the finest collections of cricket books. He finally decided to dispose them of. P.R. Man Singh [India manager at the 1983 World Cup], who is based in Hyderabad, got a lot of books. So did Dr. Patil, who kept those fascinating books at D.Y. Patil Sports Complex.”

Raiji made his debut in 1939 for a Cricket Club of India (CCI) team against Central Provinces and Berar in Nagpur. The debutant scored a duck and one run in the game. He got the chance to share the dressing room with Lala Amarnath, Vijay Merchant, C.K. Nayudu and Vijay Hazare.

“I have played a few times against him at the CCI,” recalled former India Test wicket-keeper Chandu Patankar, adding: “When I joined as a sports secretary [at CCI from 1994 to 2009], he helped us immensely in organising lectures for the Legends Club programmes as well.”

The Legends Club is a gathering of cricket connoisseurs and it organises lectures on cricketing themes and hosts famous players. Mr. Patankar said, “We would work under his guidance. As a cricketer, I played very little with him, but he supported us hugely in organising cricket-related events [CCI and Legends Club].” He added, “Even after quitting the game, Raiji was in regular touch with late Sir Don Bradman. He would write letters to Bradman and the Australian legend would reply.”

Even though memory plays truant these days, Raiji still watches cricket on television and reads the sports pages of newspapers. It has been a fulfilling life for the 100-year-old who was an active patron of the game long after hanging up his boots. The quiet respect he commands among the fraternity was evident from two famous faces who dropped in earlier to greet him: Sachin Tendulkar and Steve Waugh.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ng0ocv/article30669772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMVasant-Raiji-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vasant-raiji-celebrates-a-unique-century/article30669773.ece
434,2020/01/28,Flash protest turns into relay sit-in at Mumbai Central,"The flash protest that began on Mordell Road around 11 p.m. on Sunday outside Arabia Hotel, situated between Mumbai Central railway station and Nagpada police station, has turned into a relay sit-in against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Firoze Mithiborwala, who organised the protest along with activists like advocate Fatima Khan, said, “We aim to create a Mumbai Bagh similar to Shaheen Bagh. The protest went on the entire night and is going strong.”

The protest began with about 75 women, some of them were accompanied by male relatives who let them take centre stage. The women sat on one side of the road raising slogans and displaying placards against the CAA. Many children had accompanied the women and they enthusiastically waved the Tricolour. The women and their relatives were seen taking turns to nap.

The Mumbai Police, on learning about the protest, rushed three vans of personnel to enforce bandobast in and around the area. Women personnel were roped in and deployed at the spot. More of them joined later.

Numbers swell

By morning, the number had swelled to over 150, with women joining the protest after finishing their chores. As fresh faces joined in, the initial protesters went home to freshen up and tend to their families. Food was cooked, children were sent to school and elders were taken care of before they rushed back to the spot.

The Nagpada police were seen taking down details of all protesters. Several officers confirmed that no permission had been taken to hold the protest. “We have deployed bandobast and taken all necessary precautions,” Vinoy Kumar Choubey, Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order), said.

On Monday night, student leader Umar Khalid reached the site. “We know the Mumbai Police for the ultimate sacrifice made by one of its finest officers, Hemant Karkare. The same martyr was insulted by this government,” he said, making a reference to MP Pragya Singh Thakur’s comments.

He also made references to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Pakistan visit. He said, “You eat biryani in Pakistan but call us, who rejected the country during Partition, Pakistanis. We are as proud of being Indians as we are of being Muslims.”

Meanwhile, the Deonar police detained two Govandi residents, Baban Thoke and Sharon Lalzare, for allegedly trying to hold a protest without taking permission. The police said the duo had earlier been booked in an offence for trying to deter a government servant from discharging his duty.

An officer said, “The duo along with two others came to ask permission to protest at 5 p.m. in Govandi. We denied them permission but they were insistent on protesting. We detained them owing to their past record. They were moved to Navghar police station to prevent law and order problems in Mulund as a large crowd had started gathering outside the station.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ucz2gw/article30669741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMPROTESTAGAINST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/flash-protest-turns-into-relay-sit-in-at-mumbai-central/article30669743.ece
435,2020/01/28,City airport all set for upgrade in 2020,"Over the next 12 months, GVK-led Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) aims to stabilise growth by undertaking initiatives, along with stakeholders, to increase the efficiency of the airport.

According to the City Airport 2020 Plan, there will be technological advancement, newer route development and capacity enhancement at the airport. It would include increasing the number of international and domestic operations from Mumbai, building India’s largest airport-based pharma cargo handling capacity, introducing new brands and categories at the terminal, and adding advanced IT systems and superior safety features to give one of the busiest airports in the world an edge over the others.

A spokesperson for the Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said CSMIA now offers 47 international destinations and 61 domestic routes. “In 2020, the airport plans to expand its connectivity to include at least seven international destinations, including Russia and China. With the development of new international routes, the terminal is expected to see steady growth in passenger traffic,” the spokesperson said.

In 2018-19, MIAL catered to 48.8 million passengers and introduced several measures to enhance operational efficiency and passenger convenience. The measures included e-gates, paperless boarding passes, pre-ordering food with delivery at the boarding gate, realignment of airline operations between terminals, addition of boarding gates at Terminal 1, and airside safety measures.

Through 2020, MIAL plans to introduce technology which will provide self-service taxi booking facility, an end-to-end advanced safety feature, tagging of passenger details, and vehicle registration number and drivers’ face with booking receipt for seamless and secure passenger travel.

MIAL is also set to introduce trolley management systems, full-body scanners, and advanced tray retrieval systems to ease operations and reduce on queuing time.

The trolley management system will ensure that a fixed number of trolleys are available at each bay throughout the day, regardless of actual demand.

Full-body scanners at certain gates will enable airport authorities to deal with the threat of non-metallic, plastic explosives and terrorism tools, including chemical, biological and radiation without physical contact. Machines that can scan hand luggage without having laptops and liquids removed are also likely to be installed.

Advanced tray retrieval systems will ease operations and reduce on queuing time at the security check point. “The system consists of a built-in tray return conveyor belt. This allows the empty trays to automatically return to the new passenger awaiting his turn and passengers will no longer need to be security screened in different locations. Families can stay together and will be screened together,” an official said.

An MIAL spokesperson said 2019 proved to be a challenging year for the airport with the closure of Jet Airways, and extensive runway maintenance work.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wxpra9/article30669726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMAIRPORTMIAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/city-airport-all-set-for-upgrade-in-2020/article30669727.ece
436,2020/01/28,Husband among three arrested for gang-raping woman in Jogeshwari,"The Jogeshwari police on Sunday arrested three people after a 23-year-old woman filed a complaint of gang-rape against them last week. The main accused is the husband of the victim and the couple stays in Palghar district.

“As per the complainant’s statement, the incident occurred on November 30 last year. Her husband took her to Jogeshwari, telling her that he was taking her out for a movie but instead took her to a small room in a slum, where the other two accused were present. He then forced her to sleep with both of them and also had forcible intercourse with her,” an officer with the Jogeshwari police said.

The officer said the victim was afraid of the stigma that would be attached if she reported the incident to the authorities, and chose to stay silent for over a month. However, she started fearing that if her husband could force her into sleeping with strangers once, he could do it again. Unwilling to go through the same ordeal, she finally approached the Palghar police last week.

“The Palghar police registered an FIR on Saturday and transferred the case to us as the offence occurred within our jurisdiction. We arrested all the three accused on Sunday,” police inspector Uday Kadam, Jogeshwari police station, said. Sources said the police first arrested the victim’s husband and based on his interrogation, picked up the other two, who stay in Jogeshwari, from their residences.

The police have so far been able to ascertain that the victim’s husband got to know the other two accused via Facebook. Inquiries are under way to find out if he was offered or received any monetary compensation in exchange for his offence. The police have also seized cell phones of all the three accused to check if any of them recorded the offence.

437,2020/01/28,Police informer held for helping Lakdawala,"The anti-extortion cell (AEC) of the Mumbai Crime Branch has made one more arrest in connection with its investigations against gangster Ejaz Lakdawala who was arrested recently. The accused was allegedly working for Mr. Lakdawala and acting as an informer for police officers.

Mr. Lakdawala, who was on the run for over 20 years, was arrested by the AEC on January 8 from Patna in a joint operation with the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force. The last case against him was registered on January 5, after he allegedly tried to extort a Mumbai-based builder on January 3.

“Mr. Lakdawala’s interrogation in this case indicated that he had received information like contact details and regular movements of the complainant from an accomplice identified as Salim Maharaj,” a Crime Branch officer said.

The officer said Mr. Maharaj was picked up for questioning on Monday and then arrested after inquiries confirmed his involvement in Mr. Lakdawala’s gang.

“Mr. Maharaj had provided tip-off to officers in the city police and the Crime Branch and would flaunt his association with some senior officers to get out of being arrested. Simultaneously, he would provide information about potential targets to Mr. Lakdawala, and has been doing this for some time now,” the officer said. Despite several complaints and reports of his criminal activities, including an alleged link to Tariq Parveen, an old time aide of Dawood Ibrahim, this is the first time that Mr. Maharaj has been arrested in a gangland-related offence.

The mangrove cell of the forest department had razed the houses as they were found have encroached upon mangrove land.

The MSHRC has directed the Chief Secretary to form a committee of experts to make a rehabilitation plan for the affected families and submit the plan within three months. The committee will consist of officials from the Slum Rehabilitation Authority, Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority, and revenue and forest departments.

“The committee would have all the powers to examine the records of the claim of the aforesaid slum dwellers, examine them or their representatives if necessary, scrutinise the documents of their claim, adjudicate their eligibility, and then make recommendations for their rehabilitation,” the order said.

The order was passed by the MSHRC on December 30, 2019. However, the detailed order copy was received by the complainants on January 24. The complaint was filed by Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan (GBGBA) in the aftermath of the demolitions.

“The mangrove cell of the forest department has been demolishing slums in Mumbai which are located in and around the mangrove areas pursuant to an order passed by the Bombay High Court directing the government to conserve and protect mangroves. While doing this the cell has completely ignored the rehabilitation rights of people living in these areas,” Bilal Khan of GBGBA said.

Jagdish Gujar, a resident of an Ambedkar Nagar slum, who lost his house in the demolition drive, said the directive gave them some hope. “The demolitions occurred for nearly a week from May 7, and nearly 1,200 pucca houses and around 800 kuccha houses were brought down. Since then many of us have been living here in makeshift houses as we have nowhere to go,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rights-commission-gives-hope-to-ambedkar-nagar-residents/article30669655.ece

A Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Tuesday deliberated on the closure notice issued by the management at the behest of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi.

According to a government source, the AFT issue was the only agenda before the Cabinet. After deliberations, the Cabinet decided to recommend to the Lt. Governor to withdraw the closure notice issued by the management and instead introduce the voluntary retirement scheme for 700-odd employees working in the mill.

The government, according to the source, was of the considered opinion that closing down a mill having huge assets would be detrimental to the interest of the Union Territory.

Addressing a press conference, the AIADMK leader said the open spat between Ms. Bedi and Mr. Narayanasamy has lowered the dignity of the constitutional offices the occupied.

“They are fighting like school kids on everything. The behaviour of the both leaders on Republic Day has spoiled the solemn atmosphere,” the AIADMK leader said. The AIADMK leader said the Lt. Governor should not have clubbed felicitation of awardees and “at home” function together.

“Lt Governor’s power and responsibility is not at the pleasure of the CM’s office but from the Union Territories Act and Business Rules approved by the President of India.

​The Chief Minister had left the function midway as he was not informed about the felicitation of Padma awardees and a few officers during the reception.​

444,2020/01/28,Puducherry starts preparing dossier for World Heritage City tag,"As a first step for Puducherry, a former French colony to get the coveted UNESCO World Heritage City tag, the government has set in motion the process for preparing an exhaustive dossier for the title.

The Old Town of Ahmedabad and Jaipur are the only cities in India to be approved of by UNESCO as World Heritage Cities.

According to a top official, “a team from the Department of Town and Country Planning and Local Administration Department visited Ahmedabad recently to study the Ahmedabad model and to understand how it was nominated as a World Heritage City. The government has to list all heritage buildings and submit a plan to UNESCO on how the heritage area should be protected to kick start the nomination process.”

The preparation of the dossier is a major exercise and to be included in the World Heritage List, the sites must be of outstanding universal value and must meet at least one of the 10 selection criteria set by UNESCO.

A workshop in this connection will be held on February 8 and experts from Ahmedabad, Dr. Rabindra Vasavada, architect and former head UNESCO World Heritage City Nomination Dossier Project and Dr. Saswat Bandyopadhyay, Professor, faculty of Planning, CEPT University will also participate. The Town Planning Department will organise the meet.

“Puducherry has already taken a leap for achieving the status by reaching three milestones in the initiative. The government has already notified a heritage regulation to protect heritage sites and heritage precincts. It has also constituted the State Level Heritage Conservation Committee with members from the government and domain experts while the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) has prepared the complete list of heritage buildings in the boulevard town, which is being vetted by the government,” said Ashok Panda, co-convenor of INTACH.

The Vysial Street restoration project, carried out by the government of Puducherry and INTACH under the Asia Urbs Programme in 2002-2004, was a unique project, which was given the UNESCO award in 2009.

The Vysial Street restoration is a good example of how cities can get incentives for their conservation. The project covered urban greening, restoration of private heritage buildings under “matching grant” scheme and restoration of Vysial Street stretch between M.G. Road and Mission Street.

The list of buildings has to be put out in public domain and individuals and institutions can give their suggestions and feedback within 30 days. After the feedback, the committee, in consultation with the government, will notify the final list of heritage buildings in Puducherry.

Once notified, along with the heritage precinct, the buildings will be protected and conserved. Any alteration or changes in these buildings or precincts can be done only with the approval of the committee.

Mr. Panda pointed out that nomination by UNESCO will put Puducherry on the international map. Puducherry will have to plan urban developments as per UNESCO guidelines.

Traffic and pollution will be monitored ensuring a cleaner and beautiful heritage city. However, any urban development in violation of the guidelines will de-list Puducherry, he added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/cfzl1g/article30673603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28JANTH-PONDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-starts-preparing-dossier-for-world-heritage-city-tag/article30673604.ece
445,2020/01/28,Pondicherry Heritage Festival gets under way,"In a life-comes-full-circle moment of sorts, the theatrical production, Bharathi Yaar, which has toured cities across India and abroad, finally made its debut in the city which gave refuge to the revolutionary poet-freedom fighter during the struggle for Independence.

In a theatrical tribute featuring an amalgam of verse, music and dance and the rallying cry of freedom Vande Mataram, an ensemble cast relived the life and times of Subramania Bharati (1882-1921) to launch the sixth edition of the Pondicherry Heritage Festival 2020.

The festival, which will be on till February 12, is hosted by the People for Pondicherry’s Heritage, INTACH and PondyCan with the support of Department of Tourism, French Institute of Pondicherry and Alliance Francaise.

And, it also could not have been more apt that the play by S.B. Creations unfolded on a stage at the Gandhi Thidal against the backdrop of an illuminated Bharathi Park, rekindling the city’s memories of the great poet, whom it had sheltered during the British crackdown on the freedom movement.

In fact, the city prides itself on its association with the legend, especially as some of his most famed works, including “Panchaali Sabatham” and “Kuyil Paattu” besides several soul-stirring patriotic songs, were composed while staying in the city.

Bharathi Yaar opens with the image of a burning pyre projected on the background screen and an euology of Bharati, of what might have been, had not fate snatched him away at the untimely age of 39. Several defining moments from phases of his life such as the Ettupuram royalty encountering him in Varanasi and goading a return to his hometown, the banter with wife Chellamma, the move to Madrasapattinam and his rise as a journalist-orator who mesmerised readers and audiences with his words/verse.

In chronicling Bharati’s life, the acts/scenes have been segmented to highlight some of the celebrated, as well as under-appreciated facets of the man — nationalist, reformer, feminist, environmentalist and polyglot.

The audience journeys through some of his immortalised lines such as ‘Vaiya Thalamai Kol’, ‘Jaya Jaya Baratham’, ‘Vande Mataram Enbom’ and Sudhanthira Thagam’, ‘Odi Vilayadu Papa’, ‘Achamillai’ and ‘Nallathor Veenai’.

Bharati’s visit to Sister Niveditha, disciple of Swami Vivekananda and the moment of enlightenment that follows, refuge in erstwhile Pondicherry, a sliver of land which was then under French rule, the association with Sri Aurobindo, and how the poet fearlessly seeks out a CID officer out to arrest him to explain the higher values of patriotism.

In a memorable moment during the play, theatre and real life intersect when the character playing the protagonist walks towards from behind the crowds to the stage and is greeted by the great grandson of the poet Subhash Bharati in the audience.

The play ends where it began — the funeral pyre.

Variety fare

452,2020/01/28,Kerala Police go smart with CIMS,"The Kerala Police have operationalised the Central Intrusion Monitoring System (CIMS), a state-of-the-art intelligent security system, to ensure round-the-clock surveillance for establishments and houses.

With the launch of the initiative, the State has become the first in the country to adopt the technology expected to boost security and reduce time taken for officers to reach scenes of crimes.

The system that is being implemented in association with public-sector undertaking Keltron is aimed at securing government institutions, high-value business entities including banks, ATMs, treasuries, commercial establishments including jewellery outlets and electronics stores, and homes.

CIMS control room

CIMS will involve a synchronisation of electronics devices including motion and temperature detectors, magnetic contacts, seismic and glass breaking sensors, and high-definition CCTV cameras, all of which will be linked to the CIMS Control Room established at the Kerala Police headquarters and is being continuously monitored by a team comprising police officials and technical experts.

Within 10 seconds

District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram City) Balram Kumar Upadhyay, who participated in a presentation held here on Monday, said the sensor would trigger an alarm at the control room within three to 10 seconds of a break-in.

The internet-powered system would also live-stream the CCTV footage, enabling the police to verify the threat and launch immediate action by dispatching the nearest police patrolling unit to the scene of the suspected crime.

According to S.P. Gopakumar, Head, Communications Division, Keltron, the arrangement has been secured with adequate safeguards. System health checks will be undertaken every three minutes to detect any malfunctioning device.

While the installation costs could vary, a monthly fee ranging from ₹500 to ₹2,700 will be charged by Keltron for maintenance.

Notably, the CIMS can be linked with existing CCTV systems, provided they are compatible with internet protocol (IP) cameras.

Mr. Gopakumar said the system was capable of handling up to 10 lakh connections in its initial phase.

10 firms

Currently, 10 establishments in Thrissur, Ernakulam and Kottayam, and two houses in Kazhakuttom and Kottayam have been linked to the centralised monitoring system.

The preparation of the contingency plan involves detailing the port structures, port vessel types that will operate in the region, the fuel they use, chemicals and fuels they will carry, and assessment of the chances of oil or chemical spill even in remote cases. The contingency plan will enable the port authorities to utilise resources at hand to deal with any accident or emergency situation.

PPP dream

The Adani Vizhinjam Ports Private Ltd (AVPPL), the multi-port operator tasked with the execution of the ambitious project, has entrusted the preparation of the OSDC plan to KITCO Ltd, the premier public sector technical consultancy agency.

The contingency plan is in the final stages of approval and this will enable the port authorities to have all the equipments, resources and people to handle any emergency situation, according to KITCO officials.

The plan will also detail the likely trajectory in the event of an accident, rescue measures to be undertaken, and preventive steps to avoid accidents.

The contingency plan being worked out for Vizhinjam seaport assumes significance, as none of the ports across the State have the facility level contingency plans.

Kerala also does not have a State-level oil disaster contingency plan in place.

KITCO Ltd has been chosen as the agency to prepare contingency plan considering its track record in the framing the State-level oil disaster contingency plan for Gujarat.

KITCO is also undertaking a port-level Oil Spill Disaster Contingency Plan for the Marine Infrastructure Developer Pvt Ltd project of Adani group in Kattupalli Port in Chennai.

KITCO has been tasked with preparation of the Oil Spill Disaster Contingency plan for the transport of cargo through Ganges.

455,2020/01/28,Indian super league: Super sub Balwant does it for ATK,"Balwant Singh justified his role of super-sub, scoring in stoppage time to help ATK get past NorthEast United FC by a solitary goal in an Indian Super League fixture at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday.

The win saw ATK regain the top spot, dislodging FC Goa on better goal-difference, though the two were tied on 27 points from 14 matches.

Balwant, a 90th-minute substitute for Edu Garcia, broke the deadlock, nodding home a corner in the 94th minute.

The first half was exciting only in patches. Roy Krishna nearly broke through in the 12th minute. NEUFC ’keeper Subhasish Roy Chowdhury threw himself in the way to foil Krishna’s efforts. The visitor launched a counter-attack a minute later, but ATK defender Agustin Iniguez blocked the shot from Andrew Keogh.

Pressing hard

The Highlanders kept pressing and would have got the break in the 16th minute when midfielder Lalengmawia kept his angular attempt on target, but ATK custodian Arindam Bhattacharya dived to make a clearance.

ATK had its best opportunity in the 39th minute when Garcia provided a defence-splitting through pass to Krishna who was free inside the NorthEast box. In a one-on-one situation, Krishna tried to chip the ball over the goalkeeper but saw the latter’s legs get in the way.

Arindam came to ATK’s rescue once again in the last minute of the first half when he managed to tip over a header from NEUFC midfielder Martin Chaves. The second session, too, kept the goalkeepers busy before Balwant scored the last-gasp winner.

456,2020/01/28,Teacher meetings held in Tiruchi district ahead of public exams for classes V and VIII,"The School Education Department is in the process of convening meetings of primary and upper primary teachers at the block level in the district, to orient teachers about the government’s instruction to achieve cent percent results in the public exams for classes V and VIII.

On their part, the teachers say they are in a state of confusion after the government made it clear that the entire year’s portions will be covered for testing for the public exams, which implies scrapping of the trimester system introduced from 2012-13, with the idea of reducing the academic burden on the students.

The trimester system with three terms in a year under which portions completed in one term are not carried forward to successive terms was welcomed by parents and teachers alike.

Primary and upper primary teachers of schools in Tiruchi district said it was unfair on the part of the State Government to discontinue the trimester system all of a sudden, since the announcement on the public exam was made during the course of the second term of the trimester.

The government order issued at the time of introduction of the trimester system said: “The rationale for introducing the trimester system is to create a school where teaching and learning is valued with an emphasis on learning outcomes demonstrated in students’ performance. A well-designed curriculum through thinner books along with creative instructional practices will form the key to success.”

A senior teacher said it would be difficult to expect the children to retain the text books pertaining to the first and second terms of the trimester. “At this point, there is time only to complete the portions of the third term and conduct revision. The scope for brushing through the portions of the earlier term does not exist at all,” a school head added.

The school heads are not prepared to take at face value the assurances by officials that the public exam was only an assessment exercise. The government is believed to have taken the stand of preparing students for the public exam from a young age to equip them for NEET and other competitive exams.

But for that to happen, the infrastructure in the schools should be strengthened and the staff strength must be augmented for creating the foundation right from pre-primary level, the teachers say.

“In the emerging circumstance, there is bound to be a number of failures if objective valuation is undertaken. But then, we are also required to toe the government policy of not detaining students. The contradiction only makes our predicament worse,"" another school head said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/teacher-meetings-held-in-tiruchi-district-ahead-of-public-exams-for-classes-v-and-viii/article30672664.ece
457,2020/01/28,"AUT demands ₹50,000 as pay for guest lecturers citing UGC directive","The Association of University Teachers (AUT) has urged Bharadhidasan University to immediately increase the consolidated pay to ₹50,000 per month for guest or hourly-basis lecturers working in its constituent colleges as per UGC directives.

At its zonal general body meeting chaired by Tiruchi zonal secretary S. Gandhi, a resolution was adopted which said that the pay revision for this category of lecturers was overdue and referred to the recent increase in pay awarded to the non-teaching staff of the constituent colleges.

Prof. Gandhi also criticised the retrospective application of UGC norms for TRB applicants for the posts of Assistant Professors in government colleges to get ‘Exemption Certificate’ for their Ph.D. The Director-Research, Bharathidasan University, was insisting on ‘publication of four Papers in UGC approved Journals,’ while the fact remains that the ‘list of UGC approved Journals’ was released in 2016 and the revised list in 2018.

The meeting urged the Department of Higher Education to direct the management of Urumu Dhanalakshimi College, Tiruchi, to immediately dissolve and dispense with the present Internal Complaints Committee, which, the AUT explained was “illegal” as per Chapter II Section 4 of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplaces (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.

A person not in the employment of the institution has been nominated as the Presiding Officer of the ICC. “It is patently illegal as per Chapter – II, Section 4 (a) of the Act,” Prof. Gandhi said. The appointments/nominations of second category of members in the ICC also do not satisfy the provisions of the Act, as per Section 4 (b), Prof. Gandhi said, pointing out that a person who had stood witness in a case currently under enquiry has been made a member.

The re-constitution of the ICC at periodic intervals since 2018 was also illegal as per the Act, he said, expressing apprehension that the ICC had been restructured with the ""ulterior motive to instill fear psychosis among teachers and victimise them under false charges.”",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/aut-demands-50000-as-pay-for-guest-lecturers-citing-ugc-directive/article30670378.ece
458,2020/01/28,Police Club for five schools in Tiruchi,"In an effort to create awareness among school students on the social evil of child marriage, POCSO Act and safe usage of social media, the law enforcers have started Police Club in five schools in the district.

Each club will have a select group of 30 students who would be sensitised by a team of visiting trainers. The initiative was launched as a pilot project here on Monday by the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tiruchi Range V. Balakrishnan who interacted with students selected for the club.

Similar clubs would be started in five government schools in other districts falling under the Tiruchi Range soon, Mr. Balakrishnan said. Students who were studying Standard eight to XI were selected for the Police Club, he said adding that they would also be imparted training in self-defence skills.

459,2020/01/28,Farmers fume over yield loss in ‘Andhra Ponni’ due to disease,"Rice blast, a fungal disease, haunts farmers, who had raised the Andhra Ponni (BPT-5204 ) variety, in Tiruchi district. With samba paddy harvest getting under way, farmers in some parts of the district have reported a fall in yield due to the disease.

While a section of farmers have claimed severe yield loss, sources in the Agriculture Department say that incidence of the disease was confined only to some places where there could have been yield losses ranging from 20% to 50%.

Puliyur A. Nagarajan, president, farmers wing of the Tamil Maanila Congress, said farmers who had raised the variety were in tears as they had suffered heavy losses. “Farmers had taken up cultivation with a lot of confidence and expectations this samba season as the storage position at the Mettur dam was good. But many farmers who had raised the ‘Andhra Ponni’ variety had suffered heavy losses as they could harvest just about eight bags (60 kg each) an acre,” he said.

On an average, farmers harvest about 35 bags an acre in the variety and some get up to 40 bags. But the price factor is the biggest attraction for the farmers. “Traders offer up to ₹1,500 a bag, while the other varieties get about ₹150 to 250 lesser. But some of the other varieties give a much higher yield, compensating for the moderate price. Yet, farmers persist with the ‘Andhra Ponni,’ due to the demand,” an officer said.

Incidence of the disease has been a recurrent phenomenon in the district over the past few years. Despite repeated advisories issued by the Agriculture Department asking farmers not to go in for the variety, as it was susceptible to the disease, a large number of farmers continue to raise it, lured by the better price that it commands in the open market.

According to rough estimates, it has been raised on about 40% of the total paddy area of about 1.09 lakh acres in the district this season. The incidence of the disease is largely confined to some places in the canal-irrigated delta areas, sources said.

“The disease has affected fields of farmers who had raised the crop late and those who failed to follow the department’s recommendations of proper seed treatment and plant protection measures,” an official told The Hindu. “We advise the farmers not to raise the crop late, beyond September, but many raised the crop in October. Dew and low night temperature make the crop susceptible to the disease,” he added.

Call for ban

Responding to the official position, Mr.Nagarajan and some other farmers suggest that the Agriculture department should ban the variety as the incidence of blast had been reported in the district repeatedly over the past few years. The yield in TKM-13 variety, recommended as an alternative by the Agriculture department, is not very good and the rice is not fine too. The Tamil Nadu Agricultural University should also come up with better disease-resistant fine varieties, he said and urged the government to sanction compensation to farmers who had suffered loss.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/y08i7m/article30670363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TYCITY-HARVEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/farmers-complain-of-yield-loss-in-andhra-ponni-due-to-blast-disease/article30670364.ece

463,2020/01/28,On-site fabrication unit comes up,"An exclusive unit has come up at Mukkombu to fabricate shutters for the barrage being built across the Kollidam.

It is being built at a cost of ₹387.60 crore to replace the old one, a portion of which collapsed in August 2018 due to heavy flood. Larson and Toubro, which bagged the contract, has completed about 25% of the civil work under supervision of a team of PWD officials. While accelerating the civil work, mainly building piers and foundation, the company has begun mechanical works simultaneously. In order to avoid delay in bringing built-in shutters as per the required measurements, it has established an on-site fabrication unit.

The unit is functioning round-the-clock a strength of 40 workers. A team of 11 mechanical engineers has been deployed from different parts of the country to supervise the work. A quality and safety assurance cell is also working at the site.

Official sources told The Hindu that it 55 shutters had been proposed across Kollidam river. While the southern arm would have 45 shutters, the northern arm would have 10. Each shutter would weigh 10 tonnes. The iron sheets and other raw material had been brought to the site for fabrication. Though welding could not be avoided during fabrication work, maximum care was being exercised to minimise the welding work in order to reinforce the maximum possible strength of shutters. The emphasis was on using single plate welding on each sheet.

The sources added that January to July was considered the ideal period for carrying out all civil and mechanical works in the construction of the barrage. At least 10 out of 55 shutters had almost been readied. The remaining shutters would be ready by March. Fabrication of platforms of the barrage was also going on.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/2kw9hg/article30670415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TYCITY-FABRICATIONUNIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/on-site-fabrication-unit-comes-up-at-mukkombu/article30670416.ece
464,2020/01/28,Electrification work over in Cuddalore -Tiruvarur stretch,"The Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL) has completed overhead electrification work in the second portion of the main line section from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai and in another stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur.

Consequent to this, a trial run of an electric locomotive was conducted in the 113-km stretch from Tiruvarur Junction to Cuddalore Junction via Mayiladuthurai a few days ago.

The trial run was successful with the locomotive operated at the permitted sectional speed of 100 km per hour.

Documents relating to completion of overhead electrification works in the Cuddalore – Mayiladuthurai – Tiruvarur broad gauge section had been submitted to the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Bengaluru, prior to his mandatory inspection, a RVNL officer told The Hindu.

The RVNL a Government of India enterprise under the Ministry of Railways which has been entrusted with the task of electrifying the 228-km main line section from Villupuram to Thanjavur via Cuddalore, Chidambaram, Mayiladuthurai, Kumbakonam and Thanjavur and in the 23-km portion branching of to Tiruvarur from Mayiladuthurai at a cost of about ₹ 300 crore. The entire main line section and the stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur falls under the jurisdiction of the Tiruchi Railway Division. The organisation had already energised the stretch from Villupuram to Cuddalore where electric loco-hauled trains were being operated consequent to statutory clearance accorded by the Commissioner of Railway Safety in March last year.

The final leg of the ongoing overhead electrification project in the remaining nearly 70-km stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur was apace with foundation works underway. The RVNL has targeted to complete the electrification works up to Thanjavur Junction by June, the officer said.

He said the RVNL was awaiting supply of power to the electric sub station established at Cuddalore as part of the electrification project. The other sub stations were coming up at Mayiladuthurai and Thanjavur Junctions. Completion of the project would pave the way for operation of freight and passenger trains hauled by electric locomotive up to Thanjavur from Villupuram in the single line stretch.

467,2020/01/28,How advertising man Mohan Menon made his foray into fiction,"“I was not actively seeking out blood and gore,” clarifies Mohan Menon about his short story collection Nail in the pillow. “I was not trying to write a Robin Cook type of book.” Having said that, he also readily agrees that his stories have more than a touch of the macabre.

Menon — who was one of the members of the board at Ogilvy and retired as its Director (South) after 32 years with the firm — has peppered his tales with the kind of characters you are likely to meet in everyday life: students, professors, homemakers and shopkeepers. Their relationships are the usual ones of parent, spouse, friend, and colleague. They crack lame jokes, harbour secret whims and yell crude cuss words, but they also grapple with pressures — and horrors — that you would not expect to encounter in their simple city lives. More than once, they are uprooted and thrown into worlds so dark that they seem unreal. This suddenness is sometimes drastic, and often makes for an abrupt, disorienting conclusion right where you would expect the story’s conflict to escalate.

For Menon, this is an inevitable part of the very style of these tales. Tales that he had been waiting to tell for a while. “These stories had been crowding my mind, choking me, for a year. The only way to be free of them was to put them down on paper. Once I did, they were all out. Now, I don’t even think of them any more,” he says.

Indeed, Menon has moved on fast. He is currently 5,000 words into his new novel, which he says will be different from the short stories in Nail in the pillow. But while the premise and the content are different, one of his biggest challenges remains the same. “In advertising, we had to create as much as we could, in as few words as possible. So for me, fleshing out a story idea was a huge challenge.” So much so, that even his short stories felt too short, and he had to expand upon a few.

“I changed the endings for a few of them, too. They were just too gruesome,” he laughs. But for the most part, for this writer, relieving these stories and these people from mind to paper was what made the darker parts of their lives a shade darker. As Menon puts it, “It was a bit like opening Pandora’s box. By opening it up, all those evil-minded people took wing.”

468,2020/01/28,Botanical illustrator Nirupa Rao’s new book is a journey into the Western ghats,"At the Hyderabad Literary Festival last weekend, amid the many panel discussions and debates, a botanical illustrator quietly made her presence felt.

Bengaluru-based Nirupa Rao was at HLF to launch her second book, Hidden Kingdom - Fantastical Plants of the Western Ghats (₹1250). The book was in the making for three and a half years, and follows her first book Pillars of Life - Magnificent Trees of Western Ghats.

Nirupa confesses that she is neither a botanist nor a trained illustrator. She studied sociology from Warwick University, United Kingdom. The love for nature was always there. She had also enjoyed painting as a child but didn’t imagine a career as an artist. “I had a narrow idea of who could be an artist; I thought one had to be flamboyant and spontaneous like a [Salvador] Dali or [Pablo] Picasso. I didn’t know of other ways to be an artist,” she says.

In a way, she thinks her education in sociology led her to become a botanical illustrator. Observant of the ecological destruction around her, she felt it’s interlinked to our culture: “We no longer feel the connect with our local plants. Only when we are familiar with our plants, we will love them and protect them,” she reasons.

Cover story Nirupa Rao has also illustrated Amitav Ghosh’s new book Gun Island and the publishing house Penguin, liking her work, commissioned her to add botanical illustrations to re-jacket four of the author’s earlier books — The Glass Palace, The Circle of Reason, The Hungry Tide and The Calcutta Chromosome.

Her parents are nature lovers and there are botanists and horticulturists in the family circles. Nirupa’s vacations during her childhood were to jungle lodges and they would spend time trekking.

Nirupa decided to combine that love for nature with her urge to do something about plants, in book form. “The botany we study in school is a dry subject. I thought it would be interesting to have an illustrated book that would get people of all age groups interested in plants and trees,” she says.

She took up an online course in illustration, and adapted the techniques to her requirements. She also applied for the National Geographic Young Explorer grant. “I had no experience in the subject. But I had an idea and I put together a portfolio with the help of my cousin Siddarth Machado who’s a botanist, my sister Suniti Rao who wrote the text, and my photographer friend Prasenjeet Yadav. Maybe our idea of looking at plants differently, through an illustrated volume, appealed to Nat Geo,” she recalls.

Nirupa’s first book Pillars of Life was in collaboration with naturalists Divya Mudappa and T R Shankar Raman of the Mysuru-based Nature Conservation Foundation. “The book is a documentation of rainforest trees that are iconic to the Western ghats,” says Nirupa.

For Hidden Kingdom, Siddarth drew up a list of plants whose stories he felt would be of interest to readers. The team then went on explorations to the Western ghats, studied the plants in their habitats. Back in Bengaluru, Nirupa would do the illustrations. “It was a lot of work,” she says, recalling the effort that went into getting the textures, shapes, size and colours of flowers and leaves as close to nature as possible. She cross checked with botanists as well.

Working on the book made her more aware of a few common plants as well, like the basket fern: “After I illustrated it, I kind of saw it everywhere around me,” she says with a smile.

469,2020/01/28,Asian Paints gives India its first organic paint line with Nilaya Naturals,"Soya bean, whey protein and casein. Sounds like a protein shake? These natural components — along with castor seeds, calcium carbonate, neem oil and pigments (like yellow oxide) — feature in what Asian Paints claims to be India’s first line of organic paints. Nilaya Naturals, launched last September at the AD Design Show in Mumbai, are organic paints made using natural ingredients.

Protein in your paint

With rising concerns about lead and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in paints leading to poor indoor air quality and health issues, several Indian companies such as Nippon Paints (with an air purifying variant), Berger Paints (Breathe Easy Emulsions with low VOC), Dulux India (water-based paints), and Nerolac (lead-free variants) forayed into the ‘natural’ paints segment a while ago. Even internationally, brands like The Real Milk Paint Co (paints with milk protein), BioShield (VOC-free), Benjamin Moore Natura (certified asthma and allergy-friendly) have made their mark in the race to being eco-friendly.

Asian Paints’ line was launched after close to two years of research. “It is not just paint — we have a full system comprising the paint, primer, putty (basecoat) and pigment,” says Srikanth SK, general manager of Asian Paints’ IDX (Innovation, Design, Digital, Customer Experience). Explaining what sets it apart, he says one of the biggest advantages is that the paints are odourless. “Even certain water-based variants emit odours that linger for weeks after the job is done. But with our range, people can live in the house when it is being painted – something that we’ve experimented with during the trials.”

Fact check The UN Environment-recommended limit for lead content in paint is 90 particles per million (ppm). A 2018 study by New Delhi-based think tank, Toxics Link, tested 20 samples (collected from Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur and Rajasthan) from Small and Medium scale Enterprises (SMEs) for the presence of lead.

When architect and designer Rooshad Shroff spotted the range at the AD Design Show, he found them close to the look and feel that he wanted for his new project, a fashion boutique in Kala Ghoda called Beige (opening this week). “We need to be as sustainable and organic as possible,” says Shroff, who avoids materials like melamine at his work sites because of its toxicity. “Irrespective of the costs and the price points, it [melamine] is something that I don’t use because it harms the people who work with it. In that sense, an option like Nilaya is good,” he says, adding that not many people are aware of VOCs in paints.

The colours also appealed to Shroff. “[The paint] is very matte, which I always prefer. The colour palette is also sophisticated, especially in the beige and grey options — softer, more earthy and quite different from the ‘flat’ paint that you’d typically see on walls,” he says, adding that the earlier shade cards from Asian Paints, in spite of having a larger spectrum of colours, haven’t matched these.

Nilaya Naturals’ earthy palette features 35 hand-picked shades, each a custom blend, featuring colours such as Daydream in Blue, Shadows over the Maidan (grey) and Return to the Nilgiris (green). “These are provided in individual sachets, which can be mixed with the paint to create custom colours. For now, each one comes in three variations, adding up to a palette choice of 105 colours,” says Srikanth. Explaining their vintage-inspired matte finish, he adds: “People have appreciated the pastel shades as they lend a two-tone feel to a finished product. Unlike other paints, once a wall is painted, it looks natural and raw. The greys and whites are doing particularly well.”

Keep them clean

Given the natural composition, will the surfaces stay free from fungal and bacterial growth? Srikanth assures that a special variant of neem oil offers the product anti-fungal properties. “The paint film that is formed is porous and breathable, which means that it allows free flow of air and moisture from in between its layers. This helps in reducing bacterial growth.” It is also important to note that these paints cannot be cleaned with a wet cloth, and in case of a stain, a touch up is required. “Since there are no chemicals, the paint is not washable. Ensure you only use a dry cloth to clean the surface.”

The interior-only paints, which come with a 10-year warranty, have already been used in over 40 sites across the country. At present, they can be accessed only via select architects and interior designers.

470,2020/01/28,Rahul Dua’s show just for laughs,"Rahul Dua new solo show Oh Hello! was staged last weekend. Weaving in three different stories, the show is for those who have a big appetite for humour.

Pretty excited to be in the city, Rahul says, “This was is the first time I am bringing my solo special to Hyderabad.” The show is proof of his changed style; narrating how he has evolved from telling jokes to stories. Reluctant about revealing more , he shares that the stories are true, weird and funny.

Most comics evoke laughter by going nostalgic about their childhood experiences and stories of their youth. Rahul’s approach is different, he says; the stories have travelled with him over the years. “Some stories have been with me since I was three and some are as fresh as from last year.” His material comes from his observations and incidents that he used to note down; he has put them together such that they reveal aspects of his personality. “Basically they are about me getting stuck in awkward situations and circumstances and how I have come out of them or deal with the situations. By the end, people will know something about me and also on how to respond if they face a similar situation.” Will people also take any life lessons from this show? “No!” he retorts. “This show is pure entertainment; you will forget your stress then and you can review it later. It is not meant make any change in your persona or perspective but only provide fun.”

Think of a guy next door, an ordinary guy who is not so good at studies, doesn’t have any other skills and cannot woo girls. He feels 80 per cent of the audience can relate to this narrative that’s why these contemporary stories are enjoyed by youngsters and adults alike.

Prior to turning a standup comic, Rahul had been an investment banker with Citibank. “All you need is one bad boss to make the change,” he laughs. Rahul worked in the banking sector for 18 months in Mumbai before he quit and moved move to Gurgoan where he managed time doing comic nights in parallel to his day job at Star TV. “Comedy was not a well paying profession,” he explains.

The drive to change profession comes from his love for the art form. “I haven’t loved anything this intensely besides my family,” he says recollecting his packed office after-hours. “After office at 7 pm, I would change clothes in the basement and take a metro to Noida to do a open mic set for just seven minutes and return again to office and go home. If I didn’t like it, I wouldn’t travel so much.” He quit the job and gave himself a two-month break and continued comedy.

Post-Comicstaan, he travelled with the Dua-Suri Show Tour and is now on pan India tour with Oh Hello! He has set ambitious targets and hopes to double his social media numbers and diversify into something besides stand-up comedy.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/y3cy7c/article30672909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym25rahul2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/rahul-dua-on-his-passion-for-stand-up-comedy/article30672917.ece
471,2020/01/28,10 more wetlands in India declared as Ramsar sites,"India has added 10 more wetlands to sites protected by the Ramsar Convention, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar announced on Tuesday.

The 10 new ones are Nandur Madhameshwar, a first for Maharashtra; Keshopur-Miani, Beas Conservation Reserve and Nangal in Punjab; and Nawabganj, Parvati Agra, Saman, Samaspur, Sandi and Sarsai Nawar in Uttar Pradesh. The other Ramsar sites are in Rajasthan, Kerala, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Tripura.

With this, a total of 37 sites in the country have been recognised under the international treaty. Wetlands declared as Ramsar sites are protected under strict guidelines.

'An acknowledgment'

The Convention, signed in 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar, is one of the oldest inter-governmental accord for preserving the ecological character of wetlands. Also known as the Convention on Wetlands, it aims to develop a global network of wetlands for conservation of biological diversity and for sustaining human life.

Mr. Javadekar said in a tweet that the Ramsar declaration is an acknowledgement of the government’s commitment to the conservation of wetlands.

“Happy to inform that Ramsar has declared 10 more wetland sites from India as sites of international importance for the conservation of global biological diversity,” Mr. Javadekar said in a tweet. “It is an acknowledgement of India’s commitment towards conservation and sustainable use of its wetlands.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/5keus2/article30675880.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28WETLAND,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/37-indian-wetlands-declared-sites-of-international-importance-under-ramsar-javadekar/article30675881.ece
472,2020/01/28,When Chennai raced to count all its bird species,"When trying to spot birds, you don’t always look up. Often, you look down amid reeds, peer through thorn bushes, squint at faraway landfills. Chennaiites did all of that and more this Sunday, spending well over 12 hours of the day in a community exercise called the Madras Bird Race.

About 171 species were spotted this year, considerably fewer than last year. First-time birders were many. These included yours truly who spent a considerable amount of time stifling yawns and catching up on naps in the car, when being taken from spot to spot. Do not judge me. I woke up at 4.30 am. I would ask why birders enjoy this, but the answer is abundantly clear.

For instance, that Perumbakam wetland is a little haven for birds is well known. What I didn’t know, however, is how amusing it is to see two large pelicans swimming amid a flock of fist-sized lesser cormorants. Like loveable misfits in a high school movie, squabbling away. Our guide, Yuvan M, told us that these two species often fish together: “Everywhere you see, pelicans and lesser cormorants have this mutualism. And in the confusion, the fish that come up to the surface are caught up by terns.”

In that wetland alone, we saw more than 50 kinds of birds: from the staid, four feet high great egret, to the little, iridescent blue-tailed bee eater with its blue tail, green wings and brown chest. The latter was snacking on a dragonfly, which is how I learnt that bee-eaters don’t eat only bees.

Perumbakam also gave us a glimpse of a mighty ‘Shaheen’ peregrine falcon, perched far away on the upper rungs of a telecom tower, happily oblivious to the excitement it had caused among starstruck humans on the ground. Equally unimpressed seemed the osprey, seated so far that only binoculars could glimpse it.

Trucks and bikes tore past us on the road, creating a cloak of noise that could not be ignored, no matter how firmly we turned our backs to them to face the birds. Very few calls managed to cut through that clutter and reach us — or reach Yuvan, since the rest of us were too clueless to identify much. A lapwing made its presence felt through birdcall, and whistling ducks whistled overhead freely as they flapped over the land. The clamorous reed warbler was clamorous. The oriental skylark was also heard — its cry is the opposite of unique, and yet remains one of its distinguishing features. As Yuvan explained, the bird picks up the calls of local birds wherever it goes, so much so that skylarks in different regions sound different from each other. Almost as if they had learnt the local language.

Godwits, however, eluded us, and a number of other birdwatchers as well. This was worrying news, especially in these days of reducing migrations and uncharacteristic flight patterns. Eventually, however, news reached us that some had been spotted in Pallikaranai. A small comfort.

As we moved towards Pallikaranai ourselves, we stopped within sight of the massive landfill. It was across a stretch of marsh and mudflat. On the flats strolled some grey headed lapwings, along with some bright specks which, on close inspection through binoculars, turned out to be yellow wagtails. Perched nearby was a solitary spotted dove, but hovering on the horizon, above the landfill itself, were numerous black kites. “So you can see that the black kite is clearly not a raptor, but a scavenger, “ observed Yuvan.

As we took a U-turn and headed back, now driving along the opposite stretch of marsh, we noticed someone whom Chennai’s birdwatchers had been dying to meet. The greater flamingo should have arrived in flocks by now, but this year managed to only reach Pulicat so far. But here, standing in the sun with not a bird nearby, was a solitary member of its species. We watched the lone flamingo for a while, before heading to our next direction.

At Madras Crocodile Bank, we were understandably distracted. Between gazing at snakes and watching crocodiles clamp their jaws to startle herons, we managed to see some purple rumped sunbirds, an Asian brown flycatcher, and some fledgling night herons. A magpie robin teased us with its call for a while, but we eventually gave up and walked out for a mid-afternoon stroll through the village opposite the park.

Here, our hardiness was first rewarded by a parakeet nestled in the hollow of a bald coconut tree. As we walked through grassy stretches, crossing wild almond tress and rows of palms, a host of others started appearing. Small, brightly green bee-eaters, open bill storks, red rumped swallows... Even a kestral, brick red with black wing tips, which seemed to be wondering what we were doing out under the sun. We heeded its judgement, and eventually headed back indoors, out of our winged friends’ territories and into our own.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/1n9ok5/article30674772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28mpBird7,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/chennais-bird-species-are-counted-at-madras-bird-race-2020/article30674776.ece
473,2020/01/28,On the art of Gatka,"On a surprisingly sunny afternoon in Malviya Nagar on Republic Day, about 50 boys and girls between 8 and 18, wielding sticks, swords and other weapons, performed jumps and cartwheels on the road. They were part of a procession of about 150-odd people commemorating Baba Deep Singh’s 338th birth anniversary. The group didn’t travel more than 7 km from the Baba Deep Singh Gurudwara, stopping every few 100 metres across five hours to demonstrate the skills of Gatka, a Sikh martial arts form.

Ravinder Pal Singh, who led the team of boys along with his brother Sarabjeet Singh, says that today, it’s taught to remind children of their heritage, to keep them agile and fit, and to ensure that the spirit of fearlessness is kept alive. The brothers, who learnt Gatka from their father and Chacha (uncle), teach it at the Hargobind Ajit Gatka Akhara (International) Budha Dal, in the Harinagar and Mansarovar Garden schools, almost daily.

“My father’s uncle came from Lahore and started teaching Gatka in Delhi 50 years ago. My granduncle also performed Gatka at a Republic Day parade,” says the Ravinder Pal, 32, proudly. Today, it is used to showcase self-defence and fighting skills and is open to people of all faiths and communities. Over 100 traditional weapons, besides swords, are used. In daily practice wooden sticks are the norm.

After the fifth guru, Guru Arjan Dev, was killed by the Mughals, Guru Hargobind, his son, propagated the idea of learning Gatka to fight oppression. Later, in the 17th century, Guru Gobind Singh, known as the master of weaponry, developed it further.

“The moves keep a person physically agile, courageous, and sharp, but also mentally alert to respond quickly,” says Pal, calling it “mind art”. With practice people learn to fight both with and without weapons. “Wrist arm movements are very important in Gatka.” The Chakra, a round weapon with little wooden balls, has a number of wrist moves. Originally the weapon had sharp protrusions, which are now blunted in order to avoid injury. The Soti is a long wooden stick, while the Tega is a long, broad sword. All moves are made to the beats of the Dhol and Nagara, both percussion instruments.

This isn’t Pal’s full-time job though. He has an interior decoration business in the day time, and keeps his evenings free to teach. Manpreet Kaur, his wife, is also a Gatka teacher; she works with the girls. She started learning it at 15 and loved it, resolving never to give it up. “In today’s time it’s very important for girls to learn self defence methods and this art is just the thing,” she says. “For me practising Gatka is like exploring the deep ocean — never ending. The deeper I go, the more I want to learn,” she adds.

For three months, beginning from Guru Nanak’s Gurpurab (birthday) in November to Baba Deep Singh’s birthday celebrations in January, Gatka performers are busy with processions. Children should start learning as soon as possible, says Pal, who offers classes at home.. “It is open to everyone, but no one should misuse it,” he adds. Children too learn with weapons, but only at the centre, for safety. Weapons are expensive, with a metal sword costing between 20,000 and 25,000. There are about 10 schools in Delhi (Uttam Nagar, Mehrauli, are a few) with approximately 100 students enrolled in them in all. “We have few families learning together. Past students have opened their akharas in New Zealand, Canada and Italy,” says Pal.

A one time entrance fee of ₹1000 to take classes at the learning centre; for classes at home, a minimum of ₹500 per class.

474,2020/01/28,New mission to take first peek at Sun’s poles: NASA,"NASA, in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), is launching a new spacecraft next month to snap the first pictures of the Sun’s north and south poles, the US space agency announced on Tuesday.

The Solar Orbiter spacecraft will have its first opportunity to launch from Cape Canaveral in the U.S. on February 7, 2020, NASA said in a statement.

The spacecraft will use Venus’s and the Earth’s gravity to swing itself out of the ecliptic plane — the swath of space, roughly aligned with the Sun’s equator, where all planets orbit.

“Up until Solar Orbiter, all solar imaging instruments have been within the ecliptic plane or very close to it,” said Russell Howard, a space scientist at the Naval Research Lab in the US.

“Now, we’ll be able to look down on the Sun from above,” said Mr. Howard, who is also the principal investigator for one of Solar Orbiter’s ten instruments.

The Sun plays a central role in shaping space around us. Its massive magnetic field stretches far beyond Pluto, paving a superhighway for charged solar particles known as the solar wind.

When bursts of solar wind hit Earth, they can spark space weather storms that interfere with our GPS and communications satellites — at their worst, they can even threaten astronauts, the researchers said.

To prepare for arriving solar storms, scientists monitor the Sun’s magnetic field.

However, their techniques work best with a straight-on view, and the steeper the viewing angle, the noisier the data.

The sidelong glimpse we get of the Sun’s poles from within the ecliptic plane leaves major gaps in the data, according to NASA.

“The poles are particularly important for us to be able to model more accurately,” said Holly Gilbert, NASA project scientist for the mission.

“For forecasting space weather events, we need a pretty accurate model of the global magnetic field of the Sun,” Ms. Gilbert said.

The Sun’s poles may also explain centuries-old observations, the researchers said.

In 1843, German astronomer Samuel Heinrich Schwabe discovered that the number of sunspots — dark blotches on the Sun’s surface marking strong magnetic fields — waxes and wanes in a repeating pattern.

Today, we know it as the approximately-11-year solar cycle in which the Sun transitions between solar maximum, when sunspots proliferate and the Sun is active and turbulent, and solar minimum, when they’re fewer and it’s calmer.

“But we don’t understand why it’s 11 years, or why some solar maximums are stronger than others,” Ms. Gilbert said.

Observing the changing magnetic fields of the poles could offer an answer, NASA said.

The only prior spacecraft to fly over the Sun’s poles was also a joint ESA/NASA venture.

Launched in 1990, the Ulysses spacecraft made three passes around our star before it was decommissioned in 2009.

However, Ulysses never got closer than Earth-distance to the Sun, and only carried what is known as in situ instruments — like the sense of touch, they measure the space environment immediately around the spacecraft.

Solar Orbiter, on the other hand, will pass inside the orbit of Mercury carrying four in situ instruments and six remote-sensing imagers, which see the Sun from afar.

“We are going to be able to map what we ‘touch’ with the in situ instruments and what we ‘see’ with remote sensing,” said Teresa Nieves-Chinchilla, NASA deputy project scientist for the mission.

After years of technology development, it will be the closest any Sun-facing cameras have ever gotten to the Sun, according to NASA.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/article19992734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN06GERMANYWORLDCLIMATECONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/new-mission-to-take-first-peek-at-suns-poles-nasa/article30673982.ece
