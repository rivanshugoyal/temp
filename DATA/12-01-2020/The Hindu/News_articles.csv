0,2020/01/12,Man booked for attacking stray dog,"The Jalahalli police have registered an FIR against a private firm employee who attacked a stray dog with a boulder outside his residential apartment on Wednesday. CCTV footage showed the man attacking the dog which was lying on the road.

Based on a complaint filed by an animal rights activist, the police booked the accused Varun Kallipatta, 29, under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.

The stray dog, whom residents called Jimmi, was sleeping at the entrance gate of the apartment, and had been living there for the last six years. “Locals said it was friendly. On Wednesday morning, Varun came out of the apartment parked the car a few yards away, got down, picked up a brick and attacked the sleeping dog,” said the police.

The dog ran away yelping in pain before collapsing. An animal rights activist Harish K.B. took Jimmi to a veterinary hospital where he is reportedly being treated for internal bleeding. Harish later obtained the CCTV footage and registered a complaint with the police.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/man-booked-for-attacking-stray-dog/article30552023.ece

Police suspect overspeeding. The deceased have been identified as Sunil Kumar, 35, a resident of Subramanyanagar; Santosh, 28, a resident of R.T. Nagar; Raghavendra, 34, resident of Cholara Palya; and Manjunath, 36, a resident of K.P. Agrahara. Barring Santosh, the other deceased are married.

Taverekere police said the youths were on their way to Kambada Yoga Narasimha temple from Bengaluru. “While negotiating a curve near Deveramachahalli lake, a dog suddenly crossed the road, resulting in the driver losing control of the vehicle. The car toppled several times and fell into the lake,” the police said.

The lake had four to five feet of water. Locals and friends of the deceased, who were following them in another car, forcefully opened the doors and rushed the occupants of the car to a hospital, where all the injured were declared brought dead.

2,2020/01/12,Firm booked for cheating government to bag contract,"The Vidhana Soudha police have registered a case against two men working with a private firm for allegedly cheating the government by submitting fake documents to bag a tender.

Based on a complaint filed by K.C. Rajanna, the health officer with the health and family welfare department, the police have booked Ashvini and Ramasanjeevaiah, owners of a firm in Chandra Layout for cheating and forgery.

In his complaint, Mr. Rajanna alleged that the accused had applied for the tender in December 2018 to provide staff for the department to fill up vacant posts in December 2018. Based on the documents provided, they bagged the tender to provide nurses, ward boys, attendants, gate keepers, and data entry operators among others.

“As per the procedure, they had to submit the financial details of the company for two years to the department which they did. But at that time, no one realised the documents were fake,” said a police officer.

The cheating came to light only recently when department officials came across the financial details of the company which it had submitted to bag another government contract, this time with the horticulture department in Chikkaballapura.”

The details of the financial transactions of the company submitted to two different departments varied drastically,” said the police. “We have sought the details from the departments to analyse them and have summoned the company representatives for an inquiry.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/firm-booked-for-cheating-government-to-bag-contract/article30551725.ece
3,2020/01/12,"Bengaluru mayor moots cutting power, water supply of tax defaulters","If the city mayor has his way, top property tax defaulters in each of the eight zones in the city, will have their utility services – power and water supply – cut.

“We have tried many ways to try to collect property tax arrears, including shaming defaulters and beating drums in front of these properties. But still there are defaulters who have refused to pay up. Now we want to get their power and water supply cut, so that it will force them pay up,” said city mayor M. Gautam Kumar.

The mayor has instructed civic officials to prepare a list of top 20 tax defaulters in each zone. “I will take the list to Bangalore Electricity Supply Company and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board seeking a disconnection of utility services,” he said.

Property tax is the chief source of income for the civic body and a cash-strapped BBMP is on a special drive to shore up its revenues. Collection of arrears, that stood at over ₹500 crore in September 2019, plays a key role in this endeavour.

Though property tax collection has been steadily improving during the last few years, the BBMP has yet to reach its target. For this fiscal, it set itself a target of ₹3,500 crore, but as December 31, 2019 – three months away from the conclusion of the financial year – it had collected only ₹2,394 crore.

However, the proposal to discontinue utility services to tax defaulters, has received mixed response even within the civic body. “The Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976 provides only one option to receive arrears – to confiscate and auction moveable properties of defaulters. The Act does not provide for disconnection of utility services. Moreover, drinking water is considered a basic human right and it is unlikely that the agencies will co-operate,” said a senior BJP councillor, striking a discordant note with the mayor, also from BJP.

However, a senior civic official pointed out that Bescom and BWSSB do regularly disconnect services, over non-payment of bills. “In Mumbai, where these utility providers work under civic the authority, disconnection over tax dues is regularly done. It is a call to be taken by the state government to ensure utility providers work in tandem with the civic body in the city,” the official said.

BWSSB Chairperson Tushar Girinath was non-committal on the issue and said the Board would examine the proposal once it received a written request from the civic body.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/787veb/article30551702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12PROPERTYTAX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mayor-moots-cutting-power-water-supply-of-tax-defaulters/article30551703.ece
4,2020/01/12,"Namma Bengaluru: With two more days for FASTag to kick in, most vehicles are still not compliant","Despite the government extending the deadline for vehicles to be FASTag-enabled to January 15, only around 50% of motorists using toll plazas in and around Bengaluru have affixed the tags.

National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) officials estimate that vehicles using the technology which allows for electronic collection of toll has increased from around 16% in the first week of December to close to 50% to date.

Long wait at cash-only booths are still the norm, while movement of vehicles at FASTag enabled ones is not as smooth as expected. This is because motorists with the tags are also using them, said motorists at toll plazas.

Motorists failing to maintain a minimum balance in their accounts, tags malfunctioning, and deduction of more money have been leading to arguments between vehicle owners and employees at toll booths.

From January 15, the number of cash toll booths at the plazas will be reduced further . “At present, most of the toll booths are reserved for FASTag users and only two or three lanes allow cash lanes. After January 15, we will allow cash transactions only in one toll booth. In addition to this, vehicles entering FASTag lanes without the tag will end up paying double the toll fee.” Mr. Somashekar added.

Sadahalli -- Taxi drivers hesitant

One of the more problematic collection points is the Sadahalli toll plaza used by those going to or returning from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA).

Officials cite lack of cooperation from taxi drivers. S.P. Somashekar, general manager and projector director of NHAI said, “We believe that regular users of toll roads have gradually shifted to the new system and the number is likely to increase. However, at Sadahalli toll plaza, a good number of taxi drivers remain hesitant. They have been demanding toll receipt which we cannot give. We are planning to take up the matter with BIAL and other concerned authorities to educate drivers on benefits of FASTag.”

Diya Shetty, who recently used an Uber to KIA noticed that her driver had not updated to FASTag. “When I asked him why, he said that he was worried that he would be charged double the toll. He was convinced that instead of the usual ₹135, he would have to pay double,” said Diya. Another KIA passenger, who hailed an airport taxi, recounted a similar experience.

Toll booth employees said they regularly receive such complaints from taxi drivers. “They claim that for a round-trip travel from the city to the airport, they were charged ₹180. NHAI has fixed ₹135 for round trip: ₹90 while going towards the Airport and ₹45 while coming from there. Because of this problem, some of the drivers prefer to make cash payments,” said a toll booth employee.

Often, toll employees simply let motorists pass to prevent long hold ups. “Many motorists are unaware of the fact that they must keep a minimum balance. When we tell them that there is no minimum balance , they argue with us and refuse to pay cash. Other vehicles start honking causing chaos. Many times we have allowed vehicle without collecting the fee,” an employee of Sadahalli gate said.

Hosakote -- Traffic moving fast

Of the 10 lanes in the Hosakote toll (five towards Hosakote and five towards Bengaluru), eight are dedicated for FASTag vehicles, and two are for cash payments. Venkata Swamy, who was travelling from a village near Nelamangala to Kolar said, “I crossed two toll plazas and in both of them, the FASTag lanes were moving quickly.”

However, slow-moving vehicles in the cash lane was a common sight at the Hosakote toll plaza. A toll plaza employee said that though one lane was dedicated for cash payments, many vehicles, which were not FASTag-enabled, used the electronic lane.

“In such cases, we give them receipts from a hand-held machines. Apart from that, there have been a few instances where there were problems with the tag and we had to give them receipts.”

There should have been more awareness created before implementation of the initiative, say toll plaza employees.

“Let all the lanes be FASTag-enabled, but one should be allotted for cash payment. People should not be compelled to pay only through online. If a few want to pay it through cash, an option for them should always be open. There will definitely be people who do not use any of the payment apps and bank accounts not linked to any services,"" Shiv Kumar, a private bus driver.

Electronics City -- No relief from congestion

Despite having affixed FASTag, a majority of vehicle owners using the Electronics City Toll gate said that they are yet to find relief from traffic congestion at the toll plaza during peak commuting hours.

Every day, 50,000 cars and heavy vehicles cross the toll plaza. “Fights often break out been those manning the booths and motorists as some motorists have an insufficient balance and start arguing,” said Balamurugan, an IT employee.

An official at the toll plaza attributed the congestion to traffic moving to NICE Road and Hosur as well as tech parks. “Due to space constraints, we cannot add more toll booths. At present, there are 18 toll booths of which only five accept cash. We are hoping that the number of FASTag users will increase.”

5,2020/01/12,"From highs of ₹200, onion prices crash to the ₹35-40 range","After reaching highs of over ₹200 per kg, the price of onions is now seeing a steep crash with the new crop harvested over the last two weeks flooding the market. This has resulted in a glut of onions, say traders.

A kilo of onions, even of the best quality, is now trading at the ₹35 — ₹40 levels in the wholesale market, leaving many farmers who hoped to cash in on the shortage unhappy. They are retailing around ₹40 — ₹50.

Traders and officials, going by the ground report on onion crop patterns and expected arrivals in the market, predict that the glut will only increase. “The prices will fall below ₹20 by the month-end and may even fall below ₹10 by February-end,” predicted Ravi Kumar of the Bangalore Onions and Potatoes Traders’ Association.

This has left the farmers worried. At present, onions from Vijayapura and Chitradurga districts and the Nasik region of Maharashtra are flooding the wholesale markets in the State.

“The earlier crop suffered massive damage owing to heavy rains. Expecting high prices, farmers — even those who used to grow maize for a second crop — started growing onions,” Mr. Kumar explained. More onions are expected to come from Punjab and Madhya Pradesh by February, even as supply from within Karnataka is also expected to go up. This will further lead to crash in prices, traders predict.

“Though the price of onions shot up recently, we did not make much profit, as the yield was very low. Onions had turned wet and were decomposing in the fields itself. What we could sell was very low. But given the prices were started growing them again, only to see the prices crashing in a free fall. It will be tough to bear these losses,” said Basavaraj, a farmer from Vijayapura.

However, G. Srinivasan, Director, HOPCOMS, remains optimistic and says that the demand for onions will also increase especially as many households had limited or even stopped purchasing the staple ingredient for a while. “There will be a stabilisation of prices, but may not crash,” he said

Coconut farmers sustain losses

Coconut farmers, too, are bearing the brunt of the price crash. The price of a quintal of copra (dry coconut) that was in the range of ₹17,000-₹18,000, a few months ago, was trading at ₹11,500 on Saturday at Tiptur APMC, the prime coconut market in the State. The prices of coconuts have also seen a dip, from over ₹20 per nut to ₹17 per nut over the last few days. However, they are still being sold in the range of ₹25 and ₹30 in the retail market.

Devraj, a coconut farmer from Tiptur, said the present copra and coconut prices will not fetch them the cultivation cost.

“The input costs – diesel, labour and fertilizers – have gone up. The cost of copra should at least be around ₹15,000 per quintal if farmers have to recover the cultivation cost. Presently, we are reeling under losses,” he added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qt5wq/article30555011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/from-highs-of-200-onion-prices-crash-to-the-35-40-range/article30550785.ece
6,2020/01/12,"Apex court is exploring possibility of adopting AI, says CJI","The Supreme Court is exploring the possibility of adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) to prevent undue delays in delivery of justice, said Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde on Saturday.

Speaking after inaugurating the 19th biennial State-level conference of judicial officers, organised by the Karnataka State Judicial Officers’ Association, he said, “We have the possibility of developing AI for the court system. But this is only for the purpose of ensuring that undue delay in justice delivery is prevented; not to replace human judges and human discretion. I must make it clear as even judges have raised this question.”

“It is only the repetitive, mathematical and mechanical parts of the judgments for which help can be taken from AI. As you all know, motor accident claim cases basically depend on calculation under a particular formula. We are exploring the possibility of implementing it,” Justice Bobde said. “Most of you are computer-savvy and know that the reading speeds with AI use are up to 10 lakhs words a second. Thousands of pages can be scanned in a matter of seconds and you can get the answer you want from the system.”

On pre-litigation

Pre-litigation mediation is the need of the hour, especially in the backdrop of the significant pendency the country’s courts are battling. There are innumerable areas where pre-litigation mediation can solve the problem, the CJI said.

“Our powers under Section 89 of the Code of Civil Procedure are not utilised sufficiently, and many times when they are utilised there may not be the sufficient success, as we experienced in the Ayodhya dispute. We thought that things could be resolved by mediation. But there was some problem and it did not help. Mediation is something that must be brought into the system,” he said.

Clarifying that it does not affect the earning prospects of the Bar, the CJI said, “Lawyers who are trained in mediation can, in fact, have a mediation Bar which can charge the same level, if not a better one, of fees for participating in mediation.”

The conference, with the theme ‘Judicial Process Re-engineering and Judicial Skill Building’, was attended by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Supreme Court judges Mohan M. Shantanagoudar, S. Abdul Nazeer and Ajjikuttira Somaiah Bopanna, and Karnataka Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka, among others.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/apex-court-is-exploring-possibility-of-adopting-ai-says-cji/article30546540.ece
7,2020/01/12,This father-daughter duo love their stamps,"A father-daughter duo secured prizes at the district-level philately exhibition ‘RAKSHAPEX-2020’, which concluded here on Saturday. Jaagruthi N. Adka, a class 8 student, won the first prize in the junior category, while her father, Nithin Kumar S. Adka, came second in the senior category.

“I started collecting the stamps when I was in class 2. This is my second time participating in this exhibition. I am very passionate about collecting Olympics stamps as I am also a sportsperson,” Ms. Jaagruthi said, adding that her father had accidentally seen her stamp collection when she was in class 6 and subsequently encouraged her to take it up more seriously.

Mr. Adka has been collecting stamps since his childhood. “But because of my daughter, my passion got a new life,” he said, after his Navy stamp collection fetched him the second prize at the exhibition.

There was a theme for each day of the three-day event, with the concluding day’s theme being culture and heritage. It saw the Bengaluru West Postal Division sharing the latest developments in Indian postal services and also showcased varieties of historical Indian and British-Indian stamps. Among the rare stamps on display were an 1854 lithograph stamp sample and an 1851 flower stamp. A ‘Crown Letter’ special cover was also released.

10,2020/01/12,"Northeast monsoon bows out, bestowing copious water but sparing people from damage caused by cyclones","When the northeast monsoon officially withdrew on January 10, it had left the State with far more water than when it blew into Tamil Nadu. It also allowed the residents of Chennai to heave a sigh of relief because they wouldn’t have to scrounge for water in the summer of 2020, as they did in 2019.

Known to manifest in myriad forms every season, the northeast monsoon surprised this time too. No cyclones, no devastation on account of rains, and yet, several dams received copious inflows, the water table improved substantially and average rainfall target was met.

Considered vitalas it provides 48% of the State’s annual rainfall (44 cm), the season is eagerly awaited. Coming after a year that sawa 24% rain deficit, expectations were high for 2019 and the monsoon managed to live up to expectations, delivering normal rainfall in the State.

Rains were mostly influenced by easterly wave activity and the State received 45.3 cm of rainfall between October and December, a2% excess (excess rainfall up to 19% of the long period average is termed normal by the Meteorological Department).

The season was memorable for its weather dynamics and new records set — be it the above average rains with no major weather systems, several major dams brimming with water at the end of the monsoon and an Arabian Sea that unusually brewed up cyclones even during December.

A subdued Bay

“Every northeast monsoon has a unique pattern and the weather keeps evolving. It is not unusual for the monsoon to spill over to early January. But, this time, the Arabian Sea churned up three cyclones — Kyarr, Maha and Pawa. That is a rare event. The Bay of Bengal remained subdued,” said N. Puviarasan, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai.

One of the most arid districts — Ramanathapuram — received 45% excess rain as the easterly wave triggered favourable conditions, he added.

Heavy rains during northeast monsoon months preceded by bountiful rains during the southwest monsoon have pushed up the availability of water for drinking and agrarian needs in the State this year. Groundwater levels too saw a sustained rise across the districts, with Salem witnessing the highest increase in water table by 5.42 metres in December 2019. “In Ramanathapuram, rainfall suited the agricultural season. About 500 acres of ayacut faced flooding as rains continued till January,” said L. Sornamanickam, Joint Director of Agriculture, Ramanathapuram.

Uneven spread

Tamil Nadu received 453.5 mm rainfall between October 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, resulting in a 2% excess compared to the long-period average during the north-east monsoon in the State. However, the rainfall was not evenly spread. While some distrcits in the west received excess rainfall, most central and northern districts ended deficient. The Nilgiris district registered 64% more rainfall than the long period average- the highest excess recorded among districts while Vellore recorded the highest deficit in rainfall - 27% lesser rain than usual.

The map shows the district-wise distribution of excess or deficient rainfall compared to long period average. The darker the red, the more the deficiency and the darker the blue, the higher the excess.

Thick and fast

Heavy rains upstream of Mettur dam during October and November helped increase the discharge into the Cauvery delta region, noted officials of the Water Resources Department (WRD).

The inflow in Biligundulu, which touched three lakh cusecs from excess rainfall in the catchment areas of Cauvery in Karnataka, added to the run-off into the Mettur dam. The Stanley reservoir at Mettur filled up to the brim four times this season. The water level in the dam attained its full reservoir level of 120ft on September 7, 24, October 23 and November 11 and was maintained at that level for nearly 100 days. The Ellis Saddle surplus gates of the dam were first raised on September 6 for samba cultivation.

Officials noted that the Bhavanisagar dam, another major resource, also filled up fast and its level was being maintained at 105 ft. “It went surplus last week. Several of the major dams now have good storage,” said an official. Dams in Tirunelveli district, including Papanasam dam, which had only dead storage till May, overflowed in December.

After 40 years, the Noyyal river had a flow of 5,500 cusecs this season and Coimbatore district also witnessed the Noyyal’s waters reaching the Cauvery. The rains increased storage in 28 major tanks, which enriched the water table in Coimbatore and Tiruppur.

Even in districts that ended up with deficit rain like Madurai and Salem, farmers and residents rejoiced as the areas recorded better rainfall compared to the previous year and dry lakes were rejuvenated. Waterbodies in the urban areas too filled up, raising hopes of drinking water availability throughout the year. In Mettur division, five out of 18 lakes have reached their capacity.

Marked improvement

As of December 2019, Nagappatinnam had an average ground water level of 1.23 m - the most in the State. Districts along the central and western regions of the State recorded the healthiest ground water levels. The average ground water levels registered an improvement in all districts as on December 2019 compared to the levels recorded in December 2018. This increase was most pronounced among the northern and central districts while the improvement in the western districts was relatively muted. The average level in Salem rose by 5.42m, the most in the State.

The Vaigai river running through Theni, Dindigul and Madurai districts witnessed water flow unusually for more days though these districts received below normal rainfall. WRD Executive Engineer of Periyar Vaigai basin, T. Subramanian, said irrigation was possible not only in the 1.7 lakh acres of land in Madurai, Theni and Dindigul districts but also in areas in Sivagangai and Nilayur regions.

Describing the retreating monsoon to be volatile, weather expert Y.E.A. Raj said the region between Pamban and Thiruchendur is not conducive for clouding. But, this time, the entire belt from Cuddalore to Kanniyakumari received good rainfall due to easterly waves. Thoothukudi too was a rain surplus district and flooding paralysed normal life for 20 days.

Several weather stations had exceeded 100 cm of rainfall, including Coonoor (137 cm) and Pamban (129 cm) this season. The forecast of South Asian Climate Outlook Forum, which is supported by the World Meteorological Organisation, has been almost spot on. It had predicted normal rainfall for coastal Tamil Nadu and slight shortfall in western districts, he said.

Improved storage

One-thirds of all reservoirs in the State were filled over 90% of their capacities as on January 9, 2020 and nearly half of them had water levels filled upto at least 70% of their capacity. The Bhavanisagar reservoir was filled 100% - the highest. Majority of them are better stocked as on January 9, 2020 compared to the same day in 2019.

Reservoir % filled in 2019 % filled in 2020 Change Bhavanisagar 70.53 100 29.47 Papanasam 69.04 97.53 28.49 Parambikulam 82.79 92.19 9.4 Manimuthar 72.82 91.54 18.72 Mettur 44.12 90.63 46.51 Pechiparai 8.92 74.11 65.19 Aliyar 57.27 73.21 15.94 Perunchanai 75.57 69.2 -6.37 Thirumurthy 71.73 57.28 -14.45 Amravathi 50.48 56.07 5.59 Vaigai 49.35 55.71 6.36 Sholayar 62.09 52.6 -9.49 Sathanur 44.19 46.91 2.72 Periyar 26.27 28.61 2.34 Krishnagiri 30.43 13.81 -16.62

Dharmapuri, as predicted, ended up with below normal rainfall. While the average rains were seemingly higher than previous years, the district was affected by patchy distribution. There were instances of heavy rains filling up a waterbody in a village and a dry spell rocked the neighbouring village. The inflow into Biligundulu did not have much impact in Dharmapuri.

According to Mr. Raj, past studies of data since 1916 have shown that whenever the State experiences an abundant southwest monsoon, it ends up with a below normal or just normal northeast monsoon.

After a good southwest monsoon that brought 16% surplus rains, expectations were high that an excess northeast monsoon would follow to create a new record and a rare climatic feature. “This year too, it scraped through with sufficient rains, conforming to the trend,” he said.

What worked

Meteorologists and weather bloggers noted that some of the global parameters like negative southern oscillation and positive Indian Ocean dipole favoured the northeast monsoon and brought rains over arid areas. Ramanathapuram was one of the districts that received more rainfall than Chennai district.

“Early arrival of easterly winds around October first week gave a good start to the monsoon. Unlike cyclones, easterly waves influenced rainfall over specific regions and were not strong enough to cover a wide region. For instance, Cuddalore recorded good rainfall whereas the neighbouring Puducherry had to manage with a deficit season. It defied the commonly held belief that the northeast monsoon is driven by strong weather systems,” said K. Srikanth, a weather blogger with Chennaiyil Oru Mazhaikalam.

The unseasonal inflow into Mettur dam this year benefited the region in the tail end. Chennai indirectly benefited through these weather disturbances that developed at a lower latitude, he added.

How Chennai fared

Chennai was one of the districts that constantly missed rains this monsoon, pulling down the rainfall to 64 cm, which is a 16% shortfall. Though it was a second consecutive monsoon-deficit year, Chennaiites are largely relieved that they are out of the spectre of another drought that was looming large.

The inadequacies of the stormwater drain network were once again laid bare as city roads were inundated even after short spells of rain.

Rising levels

A simiar analysis for average ground water levels in Chennai shows that the levels improved in all zones of the city except Kodambakkam, Madhavaram, and Royapuram which saw a drop in ground water levels. Ground water level in Perungudi saw the most improvement as of December 2019 compared to that as of December 2018 while they worsened the most in Kodambakkam. Ground water level in Sholinganallur was the highest in the city as of December 2019.

Zone December 18 December 19 Change Sholinganallur 3.48 2.68 -0.8 Perungudi 4.62 3.15 -1.47 Manali 4.03 3.45 -0.58 Anna Nagar 4.25 3.71 -0.54 Thiruvotriyur 4.19 3.9 -0.29 Alandur 4.93 4.05 -0.88 Ambathur 4.88 4.54 -0.34 Thiruvika Nagar 4.94 4.6 -0.34 Madhavaram 4.36 4.6 0.24 Teynampet 4.77 4.66 -0.11 valasaravakkam 5.13 5 -0.13 Tondiarpet 6.37 5.48 -0.89 Kodambakkam 4.88 5.66 0.78 Royapuram 6.23 6.27 0.04

A comfortable storage in the city reservoirs and a recharged water table gave Chennai Metrowater the confidence to announce that the city was officially out of a shortage.

Just as in the past, an extended and surplus southwest monsoon saved Chennai from yet another drought year. Severe water crisis and demand for water tankers turned people’s attention towards harnessing rainwater. Mani, a resident of Bishop Garden, in R.A. Puram, said that it had been a few months since their apartment complex bought a tanker load of water. “Our complex has become self-sufficient with shallow wells charged with rooftop water. Our own resources yield about 40,000 litres a day,” he added.

People along OMR were the first to wake up to the crisis and many gated communities adopted innovative rainwater harvesting measures. Intermittent rainfall spread through the months improved the water table across the city and put an end to the scramble for water. Rain Centre’s director Sekar Raghavan said this year more people opted for rainwater harvesting to escape a repeat of the 2003 and 2018-19 droughts.

Chennai's key sources

While water levels in reservoirs in and around Chennai were not as high as some others in the State as on January 9, 2020, most showed significant improvement in their levels compared to the same day in 2019. Veeranam and Redhills were filled the most as the levels in the latter showed an improvement of 52.57 percentage points - the most in the city.

Reservoir % filled in 2019 % filled in 2020 Change (% points) Veeranam 87.5 79.81 -7.69 Redhills 26.79 79.36 52.57 Poondi 8.29 46.52 38.23 Chembarambakkam 2.33 45.76 43.43 Cholavaram 4.44 6.66 2.22

“In clayey soil areas like Ambattur, Mogappair and Nanganallur, water percolation would be slow. But the groundwater table would increase rapidly unlike sandy areas like Triplicane, Besant Nagar or Tiruvottiyur where water table is distributed over a larger area. It takes a long time to build up an aquifer,” he said.

More public awareness on recharge wells in public spaces like road corners in R.A. Puram and Gandhi Nagar also paved the way for improved groundwater levels. Instead of indiscriminate construction of stormwater drains, the civic body must explore possibilities of sinking recharge wells in keeping with soil conditions in an area. Excess rainwater collected could be diverted to neighbouring tanks and then to the waterways through drains, Mr. Raghavan added.

Desilting of waterbodies, be it through government or people’s initiatives, has yielded better storage. Abundant inflow into 2,000 rain-fed tanks has led to cultivation of paddy, vegetables and minor foodgrains in 90,000 hectares of land in Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts. The desilting of supply channels and waterbodies ahead of the monsoon under the Kudimaramath scheme helped many districts, including Kancheepuram and Tirunelveli, to store water and increase cultivation.

Officials of the WRD noted that 65% of the 924 tanks in Kancheepuram district saw a surplus this year.

The initial rainfall recharged the water table that had plummeted during prolonged drought and then filled up the tanks. The two check dams built across the Palar river also helped conserve 1,500 million cubic feet of rainwater.

Weather experts noted that Chennai’s annual rainfall had crossed the 100-cm mark this year. The weather stations in Tambaram, Poonamallee, Meenambakkam and south Chennai received more rainfall than Nungambakkam.

Mr. Raj said it is wrong to declare Chennai and Tamil Nadu to be rain-deficit. “We have had epochs of poor rainfall like a few years in 1981-1990 and 2011-2019. But, we cannot conclude that there has been a decrease in northeast monsoon rainfall. But the southwest monsoon is growing to be more reliable for places like Chennai in the past three decades,” he said.

Experts call for a denser network of observation stations to study the spatial variations of rainfall over Chennai district. Every northeast monsoon is different and studies are limited. There is something to learn about the evolving weather parameters of the incredibly unstable monsoon. Residents and government agencies must be prepared to tackle the vagaries of the weather every year as the monsoon could spring surprises, experts added.

14,2020/01/12,"Those with normal BP should also cut salt intake, says expert","Having normal blood pressure (BP) level does not mean one can take more salt with their food. Cutting down salt intake by 10% to 20% could prevent strokes, heart attacks and kidney failure to a great extent, according to Rajan Ravichandran, chairman of Sapiens Health Foundation.

“Everyone knows they should reduce salt once they have high BP. We want to target the normal population. They should reduce salt intake to prevent high BP. Hence, we have shifted our target to students so that they reduce their intake at a young age,” he said while distributing prizes to schoolchildren for an essay writing contest on “Salt in Diet and Health” on Friday.

The foundation that has been campaigning for low salt intake for the last 11 years wrote to nearly 300 food manufacturers to cut down added salt in their products, Mr. Ravichandran said. “Instant noodles has the highest salt content. We wrote to the food manufacturers a year ago, and two responded. One manufacturer said they have their own salt reduction programme, while the other reduced the salt level in their product,” Mr. Ravichandran added.

He said the world’s number one killer was hypertension and its complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure. K.N. Ramaswamy, director of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Chennai Kendra), said extra tax on salt would create awareness on the impact of having excess salt.

“Schools should ensure that children avoid processed food,” he said.

15,2020/01/12,Mylapore street comes alive with kolams,"As V. Mythili, a resident of Mylapore, deftly drew an intricate pattern on the road at North Mada Street, a group gathered around her, clicking photographs of her kolam.

The octogenarian was one among over hundred participants of the kolam contest, organised as a part of the Sundaram Finance Mylapore Festival, on Saturday evening.

“For many of us here, drawing kolams has gone from an interest to a passion. Every day, I think of a new design and draw it at home,” Ms Mythili said.

For many other participants like V. Raji from Alwarpet, several designs online and video tutorials on how to draw kolams helped develop interest in recent times.

Participants at the contest were given around an hour to complete their kolams, and watching them keenly were several onlookers. Several tourists visiting the Kapaleeswarar Temple too stopped by to see the competition. As many as 15 kolams were selected and the participants given prizes at the end of the contest.

“Having participated in the festival for many years now, I’ve learnt a lot of interesting kolam techniques from other participants here,” said Jayanthi Murugesh, a participant from T. Nagar, who also won a prize at the competition.

Vincent D’Souza, director of the Mylapore Festival, said the festival initially began with the kolam competition as a standalone event, and over the years, had evolved into a much bigger cultural festival. “The festival and events such as the kolam contest are aimed at spreading the message that the temple and its surrounding areas need to be preserved and promoted as a cultural heritage zone,” he said.

The Grandmaster from Belarus seized the opportunity after Karthik, playing white, erred in judgement and made a knight-move on the 40th turn. Six moves later, the decision to sacrifice his rook for a bishop backfired and thereon, it was downhill for Karthik who resigned after 68 moves.

With four rounds to go, Aleksandrov enjoyed a one-point lead over 13 players sharing the second spot.

On the second of the double-round days, Karthik started by stunning fourth seeded Peruvian Grandmaster Jose Eduardo Martinez Alcantara to lead with Aleksandrov, who defeated Bangladesh’s Ziaur Rahman.

Before Karthik lost his first game, C.R.G. Krishna surrendered to Alcantara on the second board. Top seed Farrukh Amonatov drew for the third time before fifth seed Abhijeet Gupta was held by P. Shyam Nikhil.

Good day for Pranesh

Surprisingly, it was ‘double’ delight for little-known M. Pranesh. He scored over two higher-rated rivals to be among those sharing the second spot.

Pranesh, rated 2317, stunned 12th seeded Ukrainian Grandmaster Stanislav Bogdanovich (2562) and then scalped Vietnamese International Master Nguyen Van Huy (2463).

Gopichand in the book’s chapter titled ‘Bitter Rivalry’ revealed how miserable he felt when Saina decided to join Padukone’s academy to train under Vimal Kumar in Bengaluru after 2014 World Championship.

“It was as if something very dear was being taken away from me. Earlier, I had literally begged her (Saina) not to go. But by then she had been influenced by others and had already made up her mind. While I didn’t want to hold her back and stall her progress, I knew this was something that wasn’t beneficial for either of us,” Gopichand revealed in the book co-written by sports historian Boria Majumdar and senior journalist Nalin Mehta.

The grapevine was that Saina believed that Gopichand was focussing more on PV Sindhu.

“Yes, I indeed had other players to look after and Sindhu had made serious progress in the two years between 2012 and 2014. But I had never intended to neglect Saina. May be I wasn’t able to convey this to her,” Gopi said.

But what hurt him more was the role he felt that Padukone, Vimal or Olympic Gold Quest (OGQ) official and former Olympian Viren Rasquinha could have played.

“May be Viren or Vimal or Prakash sir could have spoken to her. I don’t know why they didn’t. In fact, they encouraged her to leave Hyderabad. It is a mystery to me why Prakash sir has never said anything positive about me while I have always looked up to him as my role model,” said Gopi.

Saina had a harrowing time at the 2016 Rio Olympics where she lost in an early round and was carrying an injury for which she had to undergo surgery.

“It was clearly the worst phase in her life. She had lost early in the Olympics and it had wasted months and years of hardwork. Gopi sir wasn’t with her anymore and she was soon to have surgery to get things back on track... She didn’t really know what to do,” Kashyap recalled the tough times.

‘Pefect Haryanvi Jatni’

Saina reunited with her childhood coach after winning the 2017 World Championship medal, something her husband feels was important before she approached the coach to get back into the fold.

“My wife is a perfect Haryanvi Jatni, if you know what I mean. She is just too headstrong and proud. She desperately wanted to go back to Gopi sir and say sorry. She needed him badly but she was too stubborn to admit it and open to him.”

26,2020/01/12,India finish 2019 as number one shooting nation in world,"On the back of its sparkling show through 2019, India finished the year as the top shooting nation in the world, leapfrogging Olympic heavyweights China and the USA.

In terms of overall medals, the tally stood at 21 gold, six silver and three bronze as India topped all the Rifle-Pistol World Cups and Finals in a unforgettable year.

A delighted National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) president Raninder Singh tweeted a screenshot of the International Shooting Sport Federation’s (ISSF) overall rankings for 2019.

“Well done Team India,” he wrote.

WELL DONE TEAM INDIA pic.twitter.com/mNiVejPYLR — Raninder Singh (@RaninderSingh) January 11, 2020

While India leads the standings with 30 medals overall, China is second with 11 gold, 15 silver and 18 bronze for a total of 44 podium finishes.

The USA is placed third with 15 medals (six gold six silver and three bronze).

The number of Olympic quotas, which now stands at a record 15, is not a only refection of the country’s rapid rise in the sport over the last one year but also sets up the shooters nicely for a record haul at the Tokyo Games, after the meltdown at Rio de Janeiro.

Besides the shooters, the federation has also worked extensively towards bringing the sport to where it is today.

27,2020/01/12,"Amid the festive revelry, empty nests and vacant hearts","Carrie, an elderly cancer patient living alone at Tulsa, Oklahoma, U.S., posted an ad on Craigslist on December 11: “Anybody need a grandma for Christmas?”

She had no relatives and no place to go to for the holidays. If invited, she offered to bring food and gifts for the children.

Unfortunately, her ad elicited rude and hurtful responses laced with cynical comments, making her withdraw it the same evening.

Kathleen Keyes, 62, lives alone in Bray, Ireland, grieving the loss of all her three children. She listlessly watched people rushing to buy things for loved ones for Christmas.

Loneliness can be stressful for the elderly with no family or relatives, more so during festivities.

For someone like me brought up in Punjab in the 1950s, Christmas was bade dinon ki chhuttiyan, the winter vacation of some 10 days. It was customary those days for children to spend vacations with grandparents.

My cousins and I looked forward to spending the holidays at my maternal grandmother’s house in a small village, about 40 km away. The trip offered many thrills, mainly the walk under a tree-lined path for the last 4 km.

We urban children were excited about visiting the village, though it had no electricity — a small price to pay for staying in untouched natural ambience. To relive those nostalgic moments, I took my daughter and granddaughter there four years ago. The house was still there, though dilapidated with the roof fallen partially. I peeped through a window, bringing back a flood of memories, including the way grandma, a well-to-do woman, pampered us and her neighbours indulged us.

Now, scores of Indian grandparents visit their children in the U.S. for a few months, just to support their grandchildren.

My landlady in Paris, a Vietnamese, had an old aunt living with her, who reminded me of an Indian grandma. My French collaborator, Corinne Dejous, a professor in electrical engineering at the University of Bordeaux, drives her two teenage children every weekend to visit her mother at her ancestral village, Les Billaux, 50 km away. They get the feel of a joint family and keep alive the tradition of visiting grandparents.

Barely surviving

The Indian joint family system survives, though barely so. An old colleague, now 80, lives alone with a caregiver in an old-age home because her son lives in the U.S. The joy of living with grandchildren has been a privilege for me and my wife for about 15 years now. My wife does the chores with the swag of a perfect grandma — cooking for her grandchildren and receiving them at 3 p.m. when the school bus arrives. It keeps her agile and happy, even as she takes her insulin shots.

Digital distractions

I do not think she had fussed over her own children as much as she does over her grandchildren, which makes me tease her sometimes. It remains to be seen if the grandchildren will lose interest soon in living with her as social media and e-commerce offer seductive appeals.

Everything that grandma does is available digitally. But the screen cannot provide her caring touch or cook dosa and aloo-paratha as she does.

Grand old ladies like Carrie and Kathleen have to look at an empty house during the Christmas vacation. But not for people like Richard Sands, 68, and his wife, Jennifer Sands, living in opulence in Florida.

The couple recently bought a second large condo, so that they can spend the Christmas vacation together with their five children and eight grandchildren when they join them each year.

28,2020/01/12,Sitting down to unaffected dialogue,"Current events have polarised social circles and even families like never before. Spaces for small talk and everyday updates, from dining tables to WhatsApp groups, feel like a minefield as we struggle to speak our minds but also preserve relationships.

To move forward, dialogue is essential among political groups and us. If anything, the dialogue in our homes, canteens and colleges matters more because it shapes the bedrock of values that will inform how we vote and act in the future.

Dialogue is an end in itself. The point is not conversion of the other to our point of view but creating a common ground and a relationship between interlocutors. In this space, we find shared understandings of problems and mutually acceptable solutions. But our true endgame is reconciliation manifested in continuing dialogue and constant renegotiation of relationships. In short, neither conquest nor compromise but consistent, enduring communication and growing mutual acceptance should be the fruits of dialogue.

Dialogue is a hothouse flower. Difficult conversations are rarely possible in public spaces. Interlocutors are locked into positions for reasons of personal prestige. Social platforms and public occasions force us to perform our opening positions for an audience, with no space to say, “I do not know” or “I have not thought of this before”. Omniscience is expected of us, and intransigence reads as conviction. Make it safe for your interlocutor to speak tentatively, raise questions or begin to change their mind; all those conditions apply to you as well, after all.

Initiate dialogue in relatively private settings where both sides can listen and respond without keeping up appearances. As both of you learn another perspective, you are safe to acknowledge your learning or a shift in your thinking.

Don’t alienate

As passions rise, so does the use of angry, intemperate language. We challenge and judge without compassion. Verbal taunts — “Have you no heart?” or “You are narrow-minded and anti-national” — are violence that makes dialogue impossible.

Far better to set aside one’s strong feelings and say, “We seem to differ. I would really like to understand your point of view.” Open your dialogue with an expression of interest in the other perspective. Could you resist an invitation to teach? Give more importance to the experiences and values that bring them to this opinion than facts they marshal because facts are filtered through experiences and values.

Listen

Many of us feel so frustrated in this present political moment that no one is listening to us. We have facts at our finger-tips, but no one will take us seriously. Inconvenient but important question: how carefully are we listening to others?

When passion and tensions run high, it is hard to hear equally fervent but opposing views. The result is a cacophony of angry soliloquies and gradually, exhausted by our anger, we tune out, claiming futility.

Just deciding that I am going to listen—genuinely listen—changes that. However hard, however painful, I will listen. Having decided to listen, I bring an open mind and an open heart into the dialogue and optimistically expect to find common ground. I pay attention to the spoken and implicit. I notice body language. I signal listening with responses like “I see” or “Is that so?” I ask real questions, like “I want to understand why you draw that conclusion.” From time to time, I offer a summary of what I have heard to demonstrate listening and give the other person a chance to clarify what they meant.

Small stuff

Perfect composition or politically correct language do not matter. People will use words from the languages and discourses they know and no two people draw on the same universe for these. Cut your interlocutor slack and focus on the meaning. If that is not clear, ask, “Did you mean to say this? Have I understood it correctly?” Take responsibility for understanding correctly; it will make the other person more comfortable as she tries to express herself. In the course of a true conversation, we will all make mistakes, have faulty arguments and use the wrong words. We must remain focused on the substance of what to say.

Information and facts are not a cudgel to demolish other points of view (or people), any more than the government’s coercive mechanisms are. To initiate and nurture dialogue, one has to be willing to admit ignorance and learn. One must wait to share.

Indeed, what do I, as initiator, bring into the dialogue apart from information? Prejudice disguised as passion? Ego expressed through judgment? These impede empathy and without empathy, dialogue is a ritual. Satyagrahis must work on themselves first, after all.

Dialogues succeed because we genuinely want to understand each other and to communicate with each other. Patience and perseverance follow from this desire and so will that elusive common ground.

29,2020/01/12,When a ‘never event’ hits a patient,"We read in the news that a 24-year-old woman died tragically on January 1 after undergoing a lifesaving procedure to control abdominal sepsis (overwhelming infection). Five days prior to that, she was rushed to a hospital in labour pain and underwent a caesarean section. She was delivered of a baby girl.

Because of the mother’s worsening condition after surgery, she was transferred to a major referral hospital on December 31, where a large abdominal abscess was discovered and emergency surgery performed. Within the large pus cavity was found a cotton sponge, commonly used during surgery to mop up blood and fluid. Despite this damage-control operation, the woman died of severe sepsis.

Her husband and relatives picketed the hospital where the caesarean section was done, and lodged a complaint with the police. A team of police and revenue officials held peace talks with them.

The response from the health officials was: “We have issued a show-cause notice to the staff seeking an explanation. We will initiate departmental action based on their replies and finding of our inquiry.”

Great! But will it solve the problem? No.

Why do I make this statement? In the fields of healthcare quality and patient safety, such punitive measures of “naming and shaming” have not worked. Having moved back to India eight years ago with the key motive to improve accountability and safety in healthcare delivery, it is my humble observation that we have a long way to go in reducing “preventable harm” in hospitals and the health system in general. I have not styled myself to be a theory-based “arm-chair quarterback” (as we portray after-the-fact-punditry with no real-time action), but rather have worked to bring in accountability at the front lines. We need to move away from fixing blame, to creating a “blame-free culture” in healthcare, yet, with accountability. This requires both systems design for safe care and human factors engineering for slips and violations.

Zero data

Global surgical procedures modelling shows that among more than 234 million surgeries performed, the incidence of retained foreign object (RFO) is perhaps 1:3000 to 1:5000 procedures. (Do we have the data in India? No! We do not have a reporting system). The World Health Organization (WHO) launched a watershed campaign during 2007-08, known as “Safe Surgery Saves Lives” and validated a protocol called “WHO Safe Surgery Check List” in eight hospitals around the world, covering population disparities. This landmark study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January 2009, showed that the death rate following surgery was reduced from 1.5% to 0.8% and complication rate from 11% to 7% before and after checklist implementation.

A key element in this checklist is the accuracy of sponge/instrument count before surgery starts and after completion, to ensure that there is no RFO. The technical details need no elaboration here, but the principles need to be emphasised.

First, we have to mandate a robust checklist implementation (it may exist on paper, but not in practice). While the accreditation boards (such as the NABH) require it, it covers only a small segment, and that too, with compliance on paper. In the two institutes of eminence that I served during the past eight years, the WHO surgical check lists (or equivalent) were not used in practice routinely when I took over, and were implemented progressively.

Second, a reporting system for adverse events needs to be set up. A patch work of this exists (for instance, pharmacovigilance, for drug-related adverse events), but there is an urgent need to start with broader adverse events reporting. A nation-wide reporting of “never events” will be a good start.

“Never events” refer to shocking, egregious, unambiguous, measurable and preventable incidents that should never occur in health care (such as RFO). I had proposed a framework to enable this, without “blame to hospital or individual”, but rather to report, catalogue, analyse and learn from errors as a system, and reduce preventable harm.

Verifiable data

Third, we need verifiable accurate data. Most of what we talk about as incidence and statistics of improvement comes from studies in developed nations and some developing countries. For example, we do not have the data on RFO in India. Fourth, a quality and safety curriculum needs to be emphasised at all levels — medical students, postgraduates, practising doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and so on.

Providing safe care without harm is a “team sport”, and we need to work as teams and not in silos, with mutual respect and ability to speak up where we observe any deviation or non-compliance with rules. Basic quality tools (like the seven tools of quality) and root-cause analysis (such as the Ishikawa fish-bone chart) for adverse events must become routine. Weekly mortality/morbidity conferences are routine in many countries, but not a routine learning tool in India.

Let the death of Priya not go in vain, with a “Band-aid” of inquiry, departmental action and dismissal/suspension. After all, healthcare workers do not come to hospitals to commit a mistake.

Even with the best of intentions to provide care, the worst outcomes (harm with disability/ death) do happen.

We must learn from errors (analysis) and learn from others (industries such as aviation), and strive towards “absence of preventable harm to a patient during the process of health care and reduction of risk of unnecessary harm associated with health care to an acceptable minimum”, which is the WHO’s Definition of Patient Safety.

We can accelerate the recent initiative of the DGHS of the Government of India to implement a National Patient Safety Framework, and set up an analytical “never events” or sentinel events reporting structure.

30,2020/01/12,Be a good driver,"Finally, you got the driving licence, realising a long-cherished dream. And it’s the beginning of tense days for us, as you take the vehicle out on your own.

As parents, we are responsible for moulding you as a good citizen, and good road behaviour is part of that discipline.

Driving is an enjoyable task — the reason you wanted us to send you to the driving school after an impatient wait to turn 18. But driving is a serious job that only a responsible person can do. As you sit behind the wheel, you shoulder the huge responsibility of ensuring safety against all odds — bad roads, reckless driving, road rage and so on. Nothing can be an excuse to play with the safety of those in your vehicle and others.

A road accident death may be just a small piece of news, but for the family of the dead, it is a story of untold miseries and trauma for long. Every accident has a “cause”, and invariably people talk about how it could have been averted with a little care. It all happens by a moment of carelessness or error of one person. That is the first lesson for a driver.

We may not able to correct the driving habits of another person. But we can discipline ourselves, learning from the mistakes of drivers who had caused accidents and pre-empting every possible cause. As a person who loves the road, it is your duty to do so.

To ensure safety, follow road rules to the letter and keep ego and a “me first” attitude away from the road.

The first part is simple. Learn road rules and keep the few basic life-saving rules to your heart always. Resolve now that you will never drive on the wrong side, even for a short distance. You will not park your vehicle on the roadside if there is no sufficient space left for pedestrians to move freely. You will not mind walking a few hundred metres to your destination, or when in the crowded city, taking an auto to the shop you want to go after leaving your vehicle in a parking space safe for other road users. You will never attend a phone while driving; nor stop your vehicle in an unsafe manner to attend a phone call, forcing other vehicles off their lanes or forcing pedestrians to walk precariously on the vehicle path. When you drive, when you stop, when you park, when you turn, when you open the door... your first concern will be the safety of others on the road.

Resolve now that road markings and road signs have to be obeyed. You will never jump the signal, cross the stop line at a pedestrian crossing, overtake or move through the wrong side, carry passengers or goods dangerously, and stop or turn abruptly without proper signal. You will use high beams only when there is no vehicle ahead or opposite. Your vehicle is always maintained well, and you will not drive if even a single lamp is defective.

Doing all these is easy, but the second part is not that. It will take a lot of conditioning to attain this — grooming your mind for the road. It is natural for a responsible citizen to get irritated when others violate safety norms and road rules with impunity. But realise that even getting irritated deters your

poise and can lead to an accident. To be a good driver, you will have to train yourself to compromise on everything for the safety of road users. You will have to essentially be with drivers who do not follow any discipline, who consider themselves to be smarter than the rest of us.

But take it from me, a good road culture will pay off and you will have the confidence that you will never cause an inconvenience to another road user or leave a chance for anyone to frown upon you for your road behaviour. You will never be caught for a violation. Most important, you are less likely to cause an accident, and that is your prime responsibility as long as you are on the driver’s seat.

31,2020/01/12,The decade of women,"The UN declared 1975 to 1985 the decade for women and focused its efforts on policies to empower them. However, the past decade was when women came together themselves to stand up for what they believed in. In the 10 years just gone by, women empowered themselves.

The movies started to reflect this change. Women did not need a hero to rescue them. Vidya Balan’s Kahaani, Tapsee Pannu’s Pink, Alia Bhatt’s Raazi, Deepika Padukone’s Piku and many more such films showed that women are not damsels in distress looking for a knight. Most women do not, however, find themselves entangled in spy operations to save the country or go on a manhunt for the husband’s murderer. The challenges women face in day-to-day life are much more mundane, but take a toll on them just the same.

As Priyanka Chopra in Dil Dhadakne Do, women struggle to establish their identity in a world run by men. Deepika Padukone in Piku cares more for others than her, and Vidya Balan in Mission Mangal faces problems balancing professional and personal lives when the family fails to cooperate. Yes, women in the past decade have come together to stand up for what they believe in, but their efforts fall short when changing the people closest to them.

A girl interested in automobiles might be asked not to take up mechanical engineering because the course involves heavy lifting and working with machinery. Job offers from far-off cities are often rejected because staying close to family is a key factor when choosing jobs. Long hours are still a no-no, because returning home after dark is a safety hazard. These are rules that we have trouble reasoning against, because for every reassuring word we utter to our parents, there is a gruesome crime against women they can give as an example to counter us.

Let us not forget that friends still have to be chosen with the utmost care because they undergo parental scrutiny. Last but not the least, marriage is still the key event in a woman’s life around which society forces her to form all her life choices.

The position of women in society is complex to analyse. While we are worshipped on the one hand, we are the victims of horrifying crimes on the other. India has women in power at the local, State and national levels headlining policy change. However, India is also home to girls who are married off while they are still children and have no say even on their own life. In the scales of justice, we have equal voting rights on one side and unheard voices on the other.

Every woman has challenges of her own and experiences that are unique. Trying to generalise them only reduces their importance. But we as a society seem to find refuge in comparing our problems to those of others. If our troubles are less intense than those faced by another, we consider ourselves privileged. It is an attitude that has helped us move forward. It is an attitude that has also prevented us from standing up for the small things in life. We need to learn to shout if our opinions are not heard, prove we are capable when we are questioned, fight when are attacked and stand up when we fall. We might lose some battles in the way, but we have to fight to win the war.

32,2020/01/12,Parenting doesn’t follow a plan,"There is no rule book really for parenting, the most daunting of tasks since the first child stepped into this wide world in its wide-eyed innocence. All the handbooks and the primers are of no help.

The first cry is fearsome, the first smile mesmerising and the first words enchanting. How does one bring up this tiny bundle into a worthy human being. There are Tiger Moms who bring up the child by the rule, there is also the overindulgent parent who allows her to have her way with most things. It is the most frustrating and exasperating task as well as the most rewarding and fulfilling.

The initial years of parenting take up all the time and energy of the parents, and as the children grow up with their myriad thoughts and demands, they are slowly fashioning themselves as individuals. In the middle of losing our minds over losing our hold on our children, it will be worthwhile to remember Kahlil Gibran’s wise words, “Your children are not your children. They are the sons and daughters of life’s longing for itself. They come through you but not from you.”

Children are by nature curious and like Alice, they get “curiouser” and “curiouser” and wonder why the stars sparkle, why the sky is blue, why trees shed leaves and flowers come drifting down? While we are answering their fathomless questions, we are confronted with the mysteries of the universe we have long since ceased wondering about. The fairy tales of handsome princes and beautiful princesses, scary dragons and gallant knights bring back our long-lost selves and help us connect with our child. We try to show them the way through the ups and downs of life till they break free.

All parents like to see their children as better editions of themselves, to succeed where they have failed, to have the courage they did not have and lead lives beyond their own.

But as they grow up, we cannot ask them to lead lives tethered to our own dreams and unrealised aspirations. To revert to Gibran, “You may give them your love but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts.” They must be seen as beings in their own right with the right to dream their dreams and think their own thoughts. They need not conform to the world’s standards or social approbation, and they must be encouraged to get off the beaten track and even take the road less travelled.

In the end, as we take a tally of their achievements and their failures, let us be kind and not judgmental. Everyone stands alone, there is no necessity for comparisons. A green blade of grass glowing in the morning light is as beautiful as the rose. The resplendent glory of the sun lands equally on both and each has a sanctified place under the sun.

Personally, I had to juggle parenting with a demanding job, tied to my desk, with seminars and meetings and training programmes thrown in for good measure. With crawling babies, hyperactive toddlers and later disgruntled teenagers, I had my hands full but I managed. Sometimes I came off with honours, sometimes not. My daughter says with a twinkle in her eye, “Were we ever brought up? I thought we were dragged up.” Bringing up sometimes involves dragging up. The bottom line is loving them through it all.

34,2020/01/12,Two held for forging details on Aadhaar cards,"The motor vehicle theft cell of the Navi Mumbai Police has arrested two men for making fake election cards and using them to obtain genuine Aadhaar cards for their customers.

Mohammad Azad (29), an agent from Khairane village, made the fake election cards, while his accomplice Rohitkumar Yadav (29), a resident of Turbhe, would issue Aadhaar cards using election card data. Mr. Yadav worked at a government-authorised Aadhaar card centre, enabling him to upload the fake details into the UIDAI software and get his customers genuine Aadhaar cards.

“Mr. Azad would ask his customers only for their name and photograph to issue the election card. He would charge around ₹3,000 for this. Several people who had no documents to prove that they were Indian got forged election cards from Mr. Azad so they could get an Aadhaar card made,” senior inspector Shirish Pawar said.

While the Aadhaar cards issued were genuine, the details used to create them were forged. According to the accused, they have issued at least 200 such cards for people. Till now, the police have recovered around 25 of these cards and suspect that the duo’s customers could be illegal immigrants.

Mr. Azad, who is a B.Sc. in information technology, had a customised software designed to create the fake electoral cards by keying in the required information. He used to run ‘Aaple Sarkar Seva Kendra’ and ‘Tin-Pan Centre’ in Koparkhairane, where he would make PAN cards for people. Around six months ago, he started making fake electoral cards for people who did not have any documents.

Mr. Azad met Mr. Yadav at Andhra Bank in Sector 17, Vashi, where Mr. Yadav handled the Aadhaar updation section. “The duo struck a deal. While issuing the electoral cards, Mr. Azad would tell his customers to get their Aadhaar cards made from Mr. Yadav. The latter would enter the forged details into the UIDAI software and give the customer a proper Aadhaar card,” Mr. Pawar.

The two were arrested on Thursday and have been remanded in police custody till January 18 and further investigations are under way.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-held-for-forging-details-on-aadhaar-cards/article30546759.ece
35,2020/01/12,Seven arrested for smuggling Pangolin,"In the second such incident this week, the police have rescued an Indian Pangolin and arrested seven men. According to the police, while two men came in an ambulance from Pune to sell the mammal, five men, who were in a car, had come to buy it. The deal was struck for ₹40 lakh.

The men who travelled in the ambulance were found to be in possession of the mammal, weighing 7 kg and 790 gm, by the Kalamboli police.

The accused have been identified as Ramesh Date (38), Sunil Date (42) and Mukesh Mohite from Pune, Umesh Pawar (32), Pandurang Chavan (35) and Vijay More from Ratnagiri and Bhagwan Mane (22) from Mahabaleshwar.

The police had received a tip-off that some men travelling from Pune in an ambulance were smuggling a Pangolin. “We learnt that they will be coming to Kalamboli on Thursday and accordingly laid a trap on Panvel-Mumbra road. We intercepted the vehicles when they reached the bus stop near Kalamboli traffic office,” senior police inspector Satish Gaikwad said. While two men were in the ambulance, five were found in the car. The police found a jute sack inside the ambulance which contained a steel barrel wrapped in a blanket. “Upon opening the barrel, we found an unconscious Pangolin inside it. The mammal was handed over to forest officers,” Mr. Gaikwad said.

The mammal is smuggled for superstitious reasons. People believe that keeping it at home brings prosperity. The accused have revealed that they had got the mammal from an Adivasi in Ratnagiri.

On Tuesday, the Khandeshwar police had arrested a 28-year-old youth, who had come from Khed in Ratnagiri district, to sell another Indian Pangolin. He was caught red-handed in possession of the mammal weighing 7 kg and 360 gm. “In both the cases, the source of the mammal seems to be same and we are trying to reach it,” Mr. Gaikwad said.

The accused were arrested under the Wildlife Protection Act for smuggling an endangered species and are in police custody till Sunday.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/owennn/article30546743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMPangolin,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/seven-arrested-for-smuggling-pangolin/article30546744.ece
36,2020/01/12,12-hour Carnatic concert held in Mumbai for the first time,"Held for the first time in the city, Mumbai Margazhi Mahotsavam enthralled a packed auditorium in St. Andrew’s College with Carnatic music for 12 hours over cups of hot filter coffee.

Maestros at work: (From left) S. Shashank, Aalmelu Mani and Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman performing during Margazhi Mahotsavam at St. Andrew’s Auditorium in Bandra on Saturday.

Conceived and produced by Banyan Tree Events, the festival featured renowned Carnatic musicians and artistes like K.M. Uthirapathy (nadaswaram), S. Shashank (flute), Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman (mridangam), Aalmelu Mani (vocal) and Abhishek Raghuram (vocal).

The festival derives its name from the Margazhi month, which is considered very significant for spiritual sadhana. Shashank started off with a composition by Saint Tyagaraja in ‘raga Kannada’ which was followed by a pallavi.

“The festival would have given the listeners a comprehensive idea of Carnatic music both instrumental and vocal music,” says Shashank.

Having studied Hindustani music under Pandit Jasraj, Shashank found it easy to connect with an audience who are not from south India.

“I have developed a style of presentation which can connect very well with north Indian music lovers giving them a taste of Carnatic music,” he said. He performed his rendition of Carnatic music to keep the listeners emotionally connected.

A senior Carnatic musician and Padma Vibhushan awardee, Sivaraman started his lecture demonstration with a composition in Aadi-thalam. While playing the thalam on his mridangam, he requested the audience to clap along to the beat. Sivaraman explained to the audience the different cattle skins used to make various layers of mridangam, which gives the instrument its tonal quality.

Sivaraman’s 45-minute lecture demonstration ended with the audience giving him a standing ovation. “Brevity is always the soul,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hd2tv/article30546726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMS-shashank-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/12-hour-carnatic-concert-held-in-city-for-the-first-time/article30546732.ece
37,2020/01/12,Man assaults doctors at Nair hospital after son’s death,"The Agripada police have booked a Bhiwandi resident for allegedly assaulting a doctor after his teenage son died during treatment at the Nair Hospital on Saturday. The Out Patient Department (OPD) of the hospital remained shut for several hours following the incident as the doctors protested the assault.

According to the Agripada police, the patient, Pawan Patil (13) was admitted for hydrocephalus, a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the brain. Pawan passed away around 5.10 a.m. on Saturday, after which his father Dattatray Patil (42) allegedly assaulted two doctors on duty. Officers said that the doctors, Kartik Asutkar and K. Prajwal Chandra, suffered minor injuries.

Dr. Kalyani Dongre, president of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said, “Pawan had been suffering from hydrocephalus since childhood and had already undergone seven surgeries since his birth.”

The Agripada police subsequently booked Mr. Patil for assault on a public servant under the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections of the Maharashtra Medicare Service Persons and Medicare Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss to Property) Act.

Senior police inspector Sawalaram Agawane said, “Mr. Patil will be placed under arrest after he completes Pawan’s last rites.”

39,2020/01/12,Minor’s rape: ‘no case for suspension of sentence’,"The Bombay High Court has refused to suspend the jail sentence of a man convicted of repeatedly raping a minor, even after she became pregnant. A Single Bench of Justice P.N. Deshmukh was hearing a criminal appeal filed by Mubarak Mohammadali Sayyed alias Chaudhari seeking suspension of his sentence and fine.

He had been convicted under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. On the basis of these charges, he was sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and directed to pay a fine of ₹25,000.

Chaudhari was the girl’s neighbour and they became friends. In January 2016, he took her to a room and on the promise of marriage indulged in physical relations. He then threatened to disclose their relationship to her mother. Even when the survivor became pregnant, he continued to force her to have intercourse with him. The victim then requested him not to leave her but he did not pay any heed. She then narrated the ordeal to her mother and filed a complaint with the police.

According to Chaudhari’s advocate, there was no evidence to establish the girl’s date of birth and since they were in love, no case of rape could be made out.

The court, however, held that “from the evidence of prosecutrix (minor), it is amply established that Chaudhari had sexually assaulted her time and again and even after she was pregnant. Admittedly, she had terminated her pregnancy and from the record it is revealed that he is the biological father of the foetus. Having considered all these aspects, no case is made out for suspension of sentence. The application is devoid of merit and plea is dismissed.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/minors-rape-no-case-for-suspension-of-sentence/article30546653.ece
40,2020/01/12,Seven killed in explosion at chemical factory in Boisar,"At least seven people were killed in a huge explosion at a chemical factory at Boisar in Maharashtra’s Palghar district on Saturday evening, according to a police official. Boisar is over 100 km away from Mumbai. The under-construction plant of Ank Pharma, where the explosion took place, is located in a Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) area at Kolwade village, the official said.

The blast, which took place during testing of some chemicals around 7.20 p.m., could be heard within a 15-km radius, and window panes of some houses in the surrounding area shattered, he said. According to Palghar Additional Superintendent of Police Vikrant Deshmukh, on Saturday, six persons died while seven were injured in the incident. The seventh dead body was recovered at 8.15 a.m. on Sunday morning.

A fire started after the blast but it was put down, he added.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray announced assistance of ₹5 lakh each for the kin of the deceased, a statement issued from his office said, adding the CM was monitoring the relief and rescue operation.

The National Disaster Response Force team was called late on Saturday night. “Local agencies rescued seven people and extricated five bodies. A team from Mumbai, with two sniffer dogs and equipment, is headed to the site. Local traffic police have provided a green corridor for quick travel,” an NDRF officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/oag452/article30548389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tarapur-chemical-factory,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/several-killed-in-explosion-at-chemical-factory-in-boisar/article30546635.ece
41,2020/01/12,67-year-old man convicted of molesting daughter’s friends,"A special protection of children from sexual offences (POCSO) court convicted a 67-year-old auto driver, Rizwan Shaikh, for sexually assaulting two girls who were his 12-year-old daughter’s friends, and sentenced him to five years in jail.

Shaikh’s daughter and her two friends used to go for a private tuition after school. On December 26, 2013, the tuition teacher called the mother of one of the girls and said Shaikh had committed some wrong act with her daughter. It was then disclosed that over the Christmas vacation, Shaikh would call both the girls to his house, disrobe them and himself, and rub himself on them. He did this on multiple occasions.

Soon thereafter, a complaint was filed at the Ghatkopar police station and Shaikh was charged under Section 354 A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code, and Sections 4 (punishment for penetrative sexual assault) and 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of the POCSO Act.

After conducting the trial, additional sessions judge Sanjashree Gharat, appointed under POCSO, said, “The evidence of the prosecutrix (minors) inspires confidence. They both narrated the incidents in detail and they are not found to be tutored. There is no contradiction and omission pointed out to the investigating officer. There is no reason for the victims to falsely implicate Shaikh,” the court said.

The Bench held that the offences proved against Shaikh were serious in nature. “He committed the heinous act with the victims, who are friends of his daughter. The victims have to carry that mental trauma throughout their life. Therefore, such an offence must be awarded maximum punishment not only to deter the accused from committing such offences in future but also to deter the public at large, who indulge in such crimes. If such accused are shown leniency then it will not send across a good message to society. Rather, it will increase such offences day by day,” the court said.

Shaikh was sentenced to five years under Section 8 of POCSO Act and directed to pay ₹10,000. He was also acquitted of other charges.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gm662h/article30546608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bmrape,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/67-year-old-convicted-of-molesting-daughters-friends/article30546609.ece
42,2020/01/12,‘Only 14% entrepreneurs are women’,"Only 14% of the entrepreneurs in India are women and 75% of them earn only ₹1 lakh per year, Dr. Anita Gupta, adviser, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, said at Somaiya Vidyavihar University on Saturday.

Ms. Gupta was speaking at a conclave on the final day of Maker Mela, a three-day event organised by Research Innovation Incubator Design Laboratory (Riidl). She said, “Although science and technology is a gender-neutral field, the latest data has shown that a lesser number of women turn out to become entrepreneurs in India. Research reports show that if women are supported to choose a career as an entrepreneur, the Gross Domestic Product of a country can rise by 1.4% in a year.”

“Women enter the entrepreneurship environment which lacks the atmosphere to facilitate them. We are working with schoolboys in Haryana to teach them how to respect the female gender,” said Paula Mariwala, founder, Stanford Angels and Entrepreneurs India.

Bhavna Pandya, innovation catalyst at Riidl, said her family was conservative, but she strived and completed her postgraduation. She said, “Boys are supported when they don’t work and use the family’s income, while a girl is forced to get married if she is not working. Girls should also be given time and space to choose their career.”

Prajakta Koli, a YouTuber and India’s first digital content creator, said a nine-year-old girl sent her a message that she was feeling suicidal because of being a victim of body shaming. Ms. Koli then wrote a song, ‘Shameless’, on the damage caused by body shaming.

Mahek Mirza Prabhu, who was booked for displaying a ‘Free Kashmir’ poster at a protest at the Gateway of India, was one of the invitees for the conclave, but the organisers said she cancelled her participation.

On Friday, around 100 innovators showcased their work, which included a drone that delivered medicines, and a robot — designed by Quanint Tech Soft Pvt. Ltd. from Hyderabad — that could cook any of the 100 dishes selected on a mobile application.

The youngest innovator, Veer Bavishi (9), a Class IV student, designed a road safety and smart car parking system. The Malad resident’s prototype, Suraksha, is designed to inform drivers if there is a bridge on the road that is lower than the vehicle’s height. Veer said, “As soon as a heavy vehicle approaches a bridge, the sensors beep and warn the driver to change the route. If an accident occurs, a notification is sent to the authority concerned.”

Vaishali Chitale (75), the oldest innovator at the event, made flowers from polythene bags. Ms. Chitale said, “Earlier, I used scrap papers to make flowers, but when I shifted to Mumbai 11 years ago, I saw polythene bags were being widely used. I then started using them to make flowers. This ensured that the plastic waste remained in the house and was not thrown out.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4snfk4/article30546590.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMDriverless-electric-shuttle,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/only-14-entrepreneurs-are-women/article30546591.ece
43,2020/01/12,Two held for gang-raping 12-year-old girl,"The APMC police have arrested two men for gang-raping a 12-year-old girl on Friday afternoon. The accused have been identified as Sachin Mahendra Kamble alias Bablya (29) and Rajkumar Folayi Prasad Saket (26).

While Mr. Kamble is an auto driver and resident of Koparkhairane, Mr. Saket is a cobbler and resident of Govandi.

The victim, a resident of Turbhe, was introduced to both the accused by a 16-year-old mutual friend. All four of them would often spend time together. On Friday, they had all met at mini seashore in Vashi and the mutual friend left early. Mr. Kamble told the victim that there was enough food at his house and the three of them could go there to eat. After reaching Mr. Kamble’s house around 3 p.m., he and Mr. Saket started drinking, and then raped the girl. When she resisted, the duo threatened her with a kitchen knife.

“The girl’s father had met with an accident and was admitted to the hospital, and her mother was taking care of him. Hence, on returning home, she did not tell anyone about the incident. However, after midnight, she started experiencing discomfort and pain and told her aunt and uncle with whom she was staying and they brought her to the police station,” senior police inspector Satish Nikam said.

The police registered an FIR and arrested the duo in the wee hours of Saturday. The victim underwent a medical check-up and her clothes were taken as evidence. The accused were booked under Sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 376 D (gangrape) of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the POCSO Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-held-for-gang-raping-12-year-old-girl/article30546578.ece
44,2020/01/12,International exhibition centre to come up in Mulund or Byculla,"The State government has shortlisted plots in Byculla and Mulund to construct a world-class exhibition-cum-convention centre.

While reviewing the State’s Industrial Policy last week, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said the city needed an exhibition centre to organise global summits, fairs, and road shows and serve as a support infrastructure for the export sector.

Awaiting approval

The revenue department will give a presentation on the selected locations to Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta on January 15. The proposal would then be tabled before the Cabinet for approval, officials said. “We have two locations in mind, Byculla and Mulund, where the centre could come up on a large area. The honourable Chief Minister had earlier suggested Navi Mumbai as a possible location, but we find these alternatives equally suitable,” said a senior official of the revenue department.

While instructing officials to start work on a global exhibition centre either in Mumbai or Navi Mumbai, Mr. Thackeray had said, “Ensuring that the State grows industrially and jobs are created for the youth at the same time is the priority of our government. From now, our government will ensure that all policies are drawn keeping labour and export promotion at its centre.”

Mr. Thackeray had suggested boosting the export potential of regions in the State. Though the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation is developing small exhibition centres in the districts, Mr. Thackeray said Mumbai must have a global centre controlled by the Maharashtra Industry, Trade & Investment Facilitation Cell (MAITRI).

Officials said MAITRI is an initiative to facilitate Ease of Doing Business and attract global investments. It will work jointly with international businesses and organise summits, fairs, exhibitions, road shows for promotion of the Magnetic Maharashtra event.

The State’s industrial policy was unveiled in 2019 by the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Mr. Thackeray days before the model code of conduct for the Lok Sabha polls came into effect. The policy was implemented from April 1.

The aim of the policy is to attract investments of over ₹10 lakh crore and create around 40 lakh jobs by 2023-24, the then minister for industries and mining Subhash Desai had said, reiterating the goal to turn Maharastra into a trillion dollar economy.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mnowi0/article30546564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/international-exhibition-centre-to-come-up-in-mulund-or-byculla/article30546565.ece
45,2020/01/12,ATP Cup final | Novak Djokovic steers Serbia to glory,"Novak Djokovic helped seal victory for Serbia in the inaugural ATP Cup team event after defeating his long-term rival Rafael Nadal in singles on Sunday before going on to play a pivotal role in the deciding doubles match against Spain.

With the final locked at 1-1 after the singles were shared, Djokovic partnered veteran Victor Troicki to beat Pablo Carreno Busta and Feliciano Lopez 6-3, 6-4 and win the title. The 16-times Grand Slam champion proved to be a calming influence throughout, especially after the Serbian pair fell behind early in the match.

He used his powerful serve and fleet-footed returns to haul his country back into the first set and create a momentum shift which Serbia rode all the way to a victory completed in the early hours of Monday morning here.

Djokovic earlier beat Nadal 6-2, 7-6(4), extending his dominance over the Spaniard on hardcourts, a surface Nadal has not beaten him on since 2013.

Djokovic has created the blueprint to beat the Spaniard on hardcourts, although he is one of the very few players good enough to follow the instructions.

Holding his line

The Serbian held his line, and was rarely pushed back deep into the court by the Spaniard’s heavy spin, a position from which Nadal usually dictates terms.

“There were some incredible exchanges today,” said Djokovic. “I started off the match perfectly really, everything worked for me.”

Earlier, Roberto Bautista Agut completed a flawless tournament by defeating Dusan Lajovic 7-5, 6-1.

The result: Serbia bt Spain 2-1 [Dusan Lajovic lost to Roberto Bautista Agut 7-5, 6-1; Novak Djokovic bt Rafael Nadal 6-2, 7-6(4); Viktor Troicki & Djokovic bt Feliciano Lopez & Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3, 6-4].",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/2zmzne/article30550160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DJOKOVIC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/atp-cup-final-novak-djokovic-sweeps-past-rafael-nadal/article30550161.ece
46,2020/01/12,Karolina Pliskova outlasts Madison Keys for third Brisbane title,"Defending champion Karolina Pliskova prevailed in a three-set tug-of-war with Madison Keys to become the first three-time winner at the Brisbane International on Sunday.

A day after clinching a nearly three-hour semi-finals duel with Naomi Osaka, the world number two overcame a mid-match blip to triumph 6-4 4-6 7-5 in the final at the Pat Rafter Arena.

Pliskova rode her big first serve to save two break points in the first set and converted on her first opportunity to surge ahead.

A set and break down, Keys broke back to level it 3-3 and went on to win the set and force a decider, in which the first six games stayed on serve before Pliskova broke the American in the seventh.

Keys refused to throw in the towel, however, and foiled the Czech’s first attempt to serve out the match at 5-4.

Pliskova could not be denied though.

The 2017 and 2019 winner broke again for 6-5 and then served it out to clinch victory in her first meeting with the eighth seeded American in a little over two hours.

“I think whats more special than winning is that I finally defend,” Pliskova said after her first successful title defence.

“Thats always harder. But, yeah, it took me a couple of years to do it, but pleased with that.”

Pliskova, who has had considerable success indoors, made no secrets of her fondness for the Pat Rafter Arena.

“It feels more like an indoor court,” said the 21-year-old, whose 42 aces in the tournament will translate into $8,400 towards bushfire relief in Australia.

“The conditions are perfect for me indoors - no wind, no sun... so I can hit with full power.”

Keys said she was surprised by Pliskovas anticipation.

“Even if youd say movement isnt her strength, she covers the court really well which makes you start to go for a little more,” she said.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/hy33zp/article30549641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PLISKOVA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/karolina-pliskova-outlasts-madison-keys-for-third-brisbane-title/article30549642.ece

The result meant that Wozniacki was unable to complete her own fairytale farewell to a tournament with which she has become synonymous, having played in New Zealand's largest city every year since 2015.

The 29-year-old Dane, who was beaten by Pegula in the singles semi-finals, is retiring after the Australian Open, which runs from Jan 20 to Feb. 2.

“I have loved coming back here,” Wozniacki said after tournament organisers made a special presentation before the doubles trophy was given to Muhammad and Townsend.

“Serena, thank you playing doubles with me, it has been so much fun and the only regrets I have is that we didn't do this sooner.

“I have had such a blast and it is rare that I have this much fun on court and it was a really fun way to finish off in Auckland.”

Williams' singles victory, however, gave the American her 73rd WTA title and broke a near three-year drought, despite having appeared in five finals since she clinched her 23rd Grand Slam crown with a win at the Australian Open in 2017.

She is chasing Australian Margaret Court's record 24 Grand Slam singles titles, but has lost two Wimbledon and two U.S. Open finals since her 6-4 6-4 victory over elder sister Venus in Melbourne.

“It feels good, it has been a long time,” Williams said. “I played an incredible opponent in Jessica and honestly it was a great match.”

Williams had struggled for consistency earlier in the week, but sent an ominous message to the Australian Open field when she demolished promising teenager Amanda Anisimova 6-1 6-1 in their semi-final and then beat an impressive Pegula on Sunday.

“I was definitely improving as the week went on and I needed to because I had some tough matches,” Williams said.

“I feel fortunate and blessed to be out here and to be healthy and to play. I have been playing for so long and been through so much and I'm happy to be doing something I love.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/tfoic3/article30549496.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TOPSHOT-TENNIS-NZL-WTA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/serena-williams-wins-in-auckland-to-donate-her-prize-money-to-australian-bushfire-relief-fund/article30549497.ece

50,2020/01/12,Four Iraqi servicemen wounded in rocket attack on Iraq base hosting U.S. troops,"Four members of Iraq’s military were wounded in a rocket attack on December 12 targeting an air base just north of Baghdad where American trainers are present, Iraqi security officials said.

The attack by at least six rockets came just days after Iran fired ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq that house U.S. forces, causing no casualties.

Recent heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran were sparked last month when a rocket attack killed an American contractor at a base in Iraq. The U.S. has blamed that attack and others on Iran-backed militias.

The attack wounded an Iraqi air force officer and three enlisted men, Iraqi security officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

No group claimed responsibility for the attack.

The rockets struck Balad air base, which hosts American trainers, advisers and a company that provides maintenance services for F-16 aircraft. Some rockets fell on a restaurant inside the airbase, the officials said.

The base is located some 50 miles (80 kilometers) miles north of Baghdad.

A statement from the Iraqi army’s official media office confirmed the attack but said eight rockets hit the base, and that two officers had been wounded. The difference in accounts could no immediately be reconciled.

""There are American experts, trainers and advisers at the base,” said one defense official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media.

The U.S. and Iran recently stepped back from escalating tensions following the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general, in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad. A senior Iraqi leader of an Iran-backed militia was also killed.

51,2020/01/12,China slams nations for congratulating Tsai,"China on Sunday slammed officials from the U.S. and other countries for congratulating Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen after she was re-elected with a landslide victory in a stunning rebuke of Beijing’s campaign to isolate the self-ruled island.

Ms. Tsai, who had pitched herself as a defender of liberal democratic values against an increasingly authoritarian China, secured a record-breaking win in Saturday’s presidential election.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as top diplomats from Britain and Japan, issued statements congratulating Ms. Tsai and the island’s elections.

But Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of its territory, denounced their actions as violating the one-China principle. “The Chinese side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to this,” said Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang.

“We oppose any form of official exchange between Taiwan and countries that have established diplomatic relations with China,” he said in a statement.

Chinese State media also sought to downplay Ms. Tsai’s victory and cast doubt on the legitimacy of her campaign by accusing the Taiwanese leader of “dirty tactics” and cheating.

Ms. Tsai and her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) used “dirty tactics such as cheating, repression and intimidation to get votes, fully exposing their selfish, greedy and evil nature”, said official news agency Xinhua in an op-ed on Sunday.

Xinhua also accused Ms. Tsai of buying votes, and said “external dark forces” were partly responsible for the election results.

Beijing, which has vowed to one day take Taiwan — by force if necessary — loathes Ms. Tsai because she refuses to acknowledge the idea that Taiwan is part of “one China”.

China doubled down on its “one-China principle” after Ms. Tsai’s victory, with Mr. Geng emphasising Sunday that “regardless of what happens in Taiwan, the basic facts won’t change: there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China”.

“The Chinese government’s position won’t change,” he added in a statement.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/utbear/article30551578.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Tsai-Ing-wen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-slams-nations-for-congratulating-tsai/article30551579.ece

“A cleric filed a case against Mr. Sarker over comments made at a show in December, and he was arrested under the Digital Security Act for hurting the religious sentiment of Muslims,” local police chief Saidur Rahman said.

Film of the show was uploaded to YouTube and more than 1,000 Muslim activists and clerics staged a rally to demand the singer's arrest. Mr. Sarker could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty at trial.

55,2020/01/12,Iran braces for protests after admitting plane shootdown,"Iran deployed riot police in the capital on Sunday expecting possible protests after its Revolutionary Guard admitted to accidentally shooting down a passenger plane at a time of soaring tensions with the United States.

Riot police and plainclothes officers could be seen massing in Vali-e Asr Square in Tehran as calls circulated for protests later in the day. A large black banner unveiled in the square bore the names of those killed in the plane crash.

The plane crash early on Wednesday killed all 176 people on board, mostly Iranians and Iranian-Canadians. After initially blaming a technical failure, authorities finally admitted to accidentally shooting it down in the face of mounting evidence and accusations by Western leaders.

The plane was shot down as Iran braced for retaliation after firing ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing American forces. The ballistic missile attack, which caused no casualties, was a response to the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general, in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad.

Iranians have expressed anger over the downing of the plane and the misleading explanations from senior officials in the wake of the tragedy.

A candlelight ceremony late Saturday in Tehran turned into a protest, with hundreds of people chanting against the country’s leaders — including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei — and police dispersing them with tear gas.

Police briefly detained the British ambassador to Iran, Rob Macaire, who says he went with the intention of attending the vigil and did not know it would turn into a protest.

“Can confirm I wasn’t taking part in any demonstrations!” he tweeted.

“Went to an event advertised as a vigil for victims of #PS752 tragedy. Normal to want to pay respects — some of victims were British. I left after 5 mins, when some started chanting.”

He said he was arrested 30 minutes after leaving the area.

Britain said its envoy was detained “without grounds or explanation and in flagrant violation of international law.”

“The Iranian government is at a cross-roads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to deescalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry said it was awaiting a police report on the arrest.

The semi-official Tasnim news agency cited an unnamed official as saying the ambassador was suspected of organising and provoking the protesters, which it said was in violation of diplomatic protocol and justified his arrest on national security grounds.

It said he was taken to the Foreign Ministry, which later released him.

Alaeddin Boroujerdi, a member of Iran’s parliamentary committee on national security and foreign policy, also accused the ambassador of organizing protests and called for his expulsion.

Mr. Qureshi’s visit came after Prime Minister Imran Khan directed him to travel to the region following the tension between the US and Iran.

Mr. Khan has said that Pakistan, which shares its border with Iran, will not be party to any regional conflict and rather play the role of a peacemaker. Pakistan’s powerful military has also said it will not allow its soil to be used against anyone.

In Tehran, Mr. Qureshi will meet his Iranian counterpart Javad Zarif and exchange views on the evolving situation in the Middle East and Gulf region, the Foreign Office said.

From Tehran, he will visit Riyadh on January 13 to hold talks with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan and consult on the issues of regional peace and stability.

“The recent developments seriously endanger peace and security in an already volatile region and underscore the need for immediate and collective efforts for a peaceful resolution,” the FO said.

During these visits, Mr. Qureshi will share Pakistan’s perspective on the current situation, stress the imperative of avoiding any conflict, underscore the importance of diffusion of tensions, and stress the need for finding a diplomatic way forward, it said.

The Foreign Minister will convey Pakistan’s readiness to support all efforts that facilitate resolution of differences and disputes through political and diplomatic means, the FO said.

Mr. Qureshi is also expected to go to the US on some later date as directed by Mr. Khan. He has already held telephonic talks with various counterparts in the region.

57,2020/01/12,Queen calls emergency meeting over Harry-Meghan crisis,"Queen Elizabeth II has summoned senior royals to her Sandringham estate in Norfolk on Monday for an emergency family meeting to discuss the future roles of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan and solve the crisis triggered by the couple’s bombshell announcement that they were stepping back from Britain’s royal frontline.

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, and their father Charles, the Prince of Wales, have all been invited to the meeting, while Meghan is expected join the discussion over the phone from Canada, the BBC quoted palace officials as saying.

Monday’s meeting — dubbed as the ‘Sandringham summit’ — will be the first time the 93-year-old monarch has come face-to-face with Harry since the Sussex crisis exploded.

The couple made their bombshell announcement on Wednesday that they intend to “step back” from being frontline royals, split their time between the UK and North America, and work towards becoming “financially independent”.

It is hoped that the talks will produce a “next step” on the way to defining the couple’s new relationship with the Royal Family — in line with the Queen’s wish to find a solution within days, the report said, adding that there are still “formidable obstacles” to overcome in the talks.

The meeting will be an opportunity for the family to discuss proposals, drawn up after a series of consultations between palace officials and representatives of the UK and Canadian governments over how Meghan, 38, and Harry, 35, can achieve their aim of carving out new “progressive” roles as hybrid royals.

The couple have said they plan to continue helping charitable causes through their new Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s foundation in June last year.

Last month, they made an application to trademark the brand across a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services.

However, that process may face some legal wrangles as it emerged that an application has been lodged in the European Union (EU) to trademark a range of goods including beer and jewellery under the same brand.

In their statement released earlier this week, they also said they would be adopting a “revised media approach”, engaging with “grassroots media organisations” and using their Instagram account, which has more than 10 million followers, to “personally share moments in their lives directly with members of the public”.

The royal family, led by the Queen, was said to be “hurt” and “blindsided” by their shock announcement, which they said was finalised after “many months of reflection and internal discussions”.

It came soon after the coupe returned to the UK from a six-week holiday on Vancouver Island in Canada, the country likely to be their second home given Meghan’s former actress connections with the city of Toronto.

58,2020/01/12,Thousands run against ‘dictatorship’ in Thai capital,"Thousands of anti-government protesters took part in the “Run Against Dictatorship” in the Thai capital Sunday in the biggest political demonstration in years.

Organisers said 10,000 people registered to join the run, which included slogans demanding Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the leader behind a 2014 coup, stand down.

In a sign of rising political tensions, government supporters held their own event in a downtown park.

Last year’s general election was meant to restore full democracy, five years after the military staged the coup. But the poll rules were widely seen as favoring the pro-military party.

The government’s sluggish economic performance has added to a growing sense of discontent.

""Everything’s worse,” one participant, an office worker who gave his name only as Sakdinan, said through a face mask. “The economy is worse and people are facing difficulties including freedom of expression.”

The trigger for Sunday’s rally were moves by courts to dissolve a popular, new progressive political party.

The Future Forward Party came from nowhere to become the third largest group in parliament with 80 seats. Their anti-military agenda made many younger Thais flock to their banner in a challenge to the deeply conservative ruling elite.

The party’s rise in popularity has been met with legal cases, through the Election Commission and the Constitutional Court, for a number of alleged breaches of the law. Many now assume the party will be found guilty and dissolved, possibly even this month.

The party’s charismatic leader, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, has emerged as the galvanizing figure behind the growing protests.

On Sunday, the billionaire businessman-turned-politician said he was delighted by the numbers who came to show their support.

""The people show great awareness of the political situation,” he said, in between posing for selfies with excited supporters.

""I believe that in order for Thailand to be able to be a democratic country again, the first step is that General Prayuth has to get out and the people here today I think we share that feeling. This is the demonstration of the anger of the people.”

Similar runs were organized in other provinces on Sunday, leaving many to wonder whether Thailand is heading for another prolonged bout of street politics. Rival camps have occupied parts of Bangkok, and sometimes fought running battles, several times over the last 14 years.

60,2020/01/12,"Prague mayor condemns China, unveils Taipei partnership","The mayor of Prague condemned China as an ""unreliable partner"" Sunday and told a German newspaper his city will sign a twinning agreement with Taiwan's capital Taipei.

The comments by Zdenek Hrib revive an ongoing dispute between Prague and Beijing that has soured Czech-Chinese relations despite a campaign by Czech president Milan Zeman for closer ties between the two countries.

In guest commentary for the weekly paper Welt am Sonntag, Hrib of the Czech Pirate Party said China was ""full of resentment"" and was trying to influence Czech public opinion.

The 38-year-old mayor, who has been running Prague since November 2018, sought to explain his administration's decision to cancel a ""sister city"" agreement with Beijing in October.

The deal was agreed in 2016, but later torn up after Zdenek's administration backed out of a controversial clause on the so-called One-China policy.

In Welt am Sonntag, Mr. Zdenek wrote that he could not sign an agreement that forced Prague to ""speak out against the independence of Tibet and Taiwan.""

Beijing views Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to retake the island one day, by force if necessary.

The Prague mayor said he would instead sign a twinning agreement with Taipei on Monday.

""That way, we have lost one partner but won another,"" he said.

If it goes ahead, the Taipei twinning would come days after Taiwan emphatically re-elected incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen, a result widely seen as a blow to China.

Mr. Zdenek said he did not advocate breaking off diplomatic or economic ties with China, but urged European democracies to think hard about ""jumping into bed with such a risky and unreliable partner.""

""I call on all of you not to give up your values and personal integrity in the face of threats and blackmail,"" he wrote.

Mr. Zdenek also accused the Czech government of ""neglecting"" ideals of the peaceful 1989 Velvet Revolution that ended four decades of communist rule in the Czech Republic.

""As mayor I am working to fulfil my campaign promise to return to a course of respect for democracy and human rights,"" he wrote.

In what President Hassan Rouhani called a “disastrous mistake”, Iran said on Saturday that a missile fired in error on Wednesday by its air defences while on alert after Iranian missile strikes on U.S. targets in Iraq brought down the plane. Iran had denied for days after the crash that it had shot down the airliner.

Even as top Iranian officials and the military issued apologies, protests against authorities spread across Iran including in the capital Tehran, Shiraz, Esfahan, Hamedan and Orumiyeh. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said he does not seek “regime change” in Iran, took to Twitter to express his support for the demonstrators, writing, “We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.”

The government of Iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground on the ongoing protests by the Iranian people. There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 11, 2020

Britain's Foreign Office confirmed late on Saturday that the country's ambassador in Tehran had been briefly detained by Iranian authorities. The Tehran-based Tasnim news agency said the envoy was arrested for several hours in front of Amir Kabir University for inciting anti-government protesters.

“The arrest of our Ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law,” Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement.

“The Iranian government is at a cross-roads moment. It can continue its march towards pariah status with all the political and economic isolation that entails, or take steps to de-escalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards,” Raab added.

A leader of Iran's opposition Green Movement, Mehdi Karroubi, called on Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down over the handling of the downed airliner.

Foreign governments condemned the downing of the plane, with Ukraine demanding compensation. Canada, Ukraine and Britain, however, called Tehran's admission an important first step.

“What Iran has admitted to is very serious. Shooting down a civilian aircraft is horrific. Iran must take full responsibility,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose country had 57 citizens on board, told a news conference in Ottawa. “Canada will not rest until we get the accountability, justice, and closure that the families deserve.”

Mr. Trudeau said Mr. Rouhani committed to collaborating with Canadian investigators, working to de-escalate tensions in the region and continuing a dialogue.

Up to 1,000 protesters chanted slogans in Tehran against the authorities, the semi-official Fars news agency said in a rare report on anti-government unrest.

Demonstrators ripped up pictures of Qassem Soleimani, Iran's most influential military commander who was killed in a Jan. 3 U.S. drone strike in Iraq ordered by Trump. Iranian missile strikes on U.S. targets in Iraq on Wednesday in retaliation for the killing led to Iran being on a state of high alert for possible reprisals when the plane was downed.

On Twitter, videos showed protesters demanding that Ayatollah Khamenei step down because of the disaster.

“Commander-in-chief resign, resign,” hundreds chanted in front of Tehran's Amir Kabir university. Reuters could not verify the footage.

Demonstrations in Iran against a hike in fuel prices turned political last year, sparking the bloodiest crackdown in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic. About 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest that started on Nov. 15, three Iranian interior ministry officials told Reuters, though international rights groups put the figure much lower and Iran called the report “fake news.”

Legitmacy crisis

Iran's clerical rulers risk a legitimacy crisis amid popular anger at the way they handled the plane's downing. The belated admission by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards squandered the national unity on display after Soleimani's killing. Khamenei, who has no term limit, has been in office since the death in 1989 of the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Khamenei is 80.

Ayatollah Khamenei, until now silent about the crash, said information about the incident should be made public.

The shooting down of the passenger jet heightened international pressure on Iran after months of friction with the United States and tit-for-tat attacks. Canada and the United States had both said early on that they believed an Iranian missile brought down the aircraft, probably in error.

“The Islamic Republic of Iran deeply regrets this disastrous mistake,” Rouhani wrote on Twitter, promising that those responsible would be prosecuted.

In a televised address on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had agreed with Rouhani on the beginning of joint work on decoding the black boxes from the downed aircraft. Zelenskiy also urged Ukraine's international partners to be united and persistent until the investigation was complete.

In Twitter messages, angry Iranians asked why the plane was allowed to take off with tensions in Iran so high. The plane, a Boeing 737-800 bound for Kiev, came down shortly after takeoff from Tehran, when Iran was alert for U.S. reprisals after launching rockets at U.S. troops in Iraqi bases.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards, in a rare step, apologised to the nation and accepted full responsibility. Senior Guards commander Amirali Hajizadeh said he had informed Iran's authorities on Wednesday about the unintentional strike, a comment that raised questions about why officials had publicly denied it for so long.

A military statement said the plane flew close to a sensitive Revolutionary Guards site at a time of high alert. Ukraine said the plane was in a normal flight corridor and Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation said the airliner had not veered off its normal course.

Ukraine International Airlines said Iran should have closed the airport. The carrier said it had received no indication it faced a threat and was cleared for take off.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9y46ad/article30541050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDUKRAINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/protests-and-condemnation-after-iran-admits-downing-ukrainian-plane/article30548401.ece
62,2020/01/12,"Storms sweep southern U.S., Midwest as death toll rises to 11","Storm-related fatalities were reported in Texas due to icy weather, in Alabama from a deadly tornado and in Louisiana, where winds were so strong that a trailer home was lifted off its foundation and carried several hundred feet. A man drowned in Oklahoma and the storms even touched the Midwest with at least one death on an icy highway in Iowa. Hundreds of thousands of people were left without power from Texas to Ohio, parts of highways were closed in Oklahoma and Arkansas due to flooding and hundreds of flights were canceled at Chicago’s international airports.

Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency to assist crews working to restore power around the state.

Two first responders were killed and another was critically injured in Lubbock, Texas, Saturday morning after they were hit by a vehicle while working the scene of a traffic accident in icy conditions, officials said.

Police Officer Nicholas Reyna, 27, who had been with the department for one year, died at the scene. Firefighter Lt. David Hill, 39, was taken to a local hospital where he later died. Firefighter Matthew Dawson, 30, was hospitalized in critical condition.

Lubbock Police Chief Floyd Mitchell called it an “extremely tragic day” for the city.

Another person had died in Texas on Friday night when a car flipped into a creek in Dallas as severe thunderstorms passed through. Lightning from Friday’s stormy weather was suspected of causing fires that burned two houses but caused no injuries in the North Texas cities of Burleson and Mansfield.

A man drowned near Kiowa, Oklahoma, after he was swept away in floodwaters, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol said Saturday. Randall Hyatt (58), of Wardville, was overwhelmed by rushing water while getting out of his stalled truck.

The Iowa State Patrol said roads were caked with ice early Saturday when a semitrailer on Interstate 80 overturned, killing a passenger in the truck east of Iowa City.

In Alabama, three people were confirmed killed near Carrollton in Pickens County, the National Weather Service in Birmingham tweeted. The Alabama Emergency Management Agency said the deaths were caused by an “embedded tornado within a long line of intense thunderstorms.”

Earlier Saturday, in northwestern Louisiana, firefighters found the bodies of an elderly couple near their demolished trailer in Benton, the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Office said via Facebook. The winds were so strong the home of the couple, who were the in-laws of a parish deputy, was moved 200 feet (61 metres) from its foundation.

The National Weather Service in Shreveport said a tornado with winds of around 135 mph (217 kph) had touched down in Bossier Parish. Drone footage showed smashed buildings, a large vehicle flipped on its side, toppled trees and debris scattered over a large area.

Also in Louisiana, Raymond Holden, 75, was killed in his bed when a tree fell on his home in Oil City, crushing him, according to the Caddo Parish Coroner’s Office.

About 67,000 customers were without power in Alabama on Saturday night, according to Alabama Power. PowerOutage.us said Georgia had about 98,000 power outages Saturday evening, with tens of thousands of outages also reported in Mississippi and Louisiana. Outages occurred from Texas to Ohio.

In Tennessee, damage was widespread throughout Shelby County, the state’s most populous county, which includes Memphis. There were numerous downed trees and power poles, some of which will need to be replaced, according to the utility.

The Oklahoma Department of Transportation said portions of several highways in the southeastern part of the state were closed due to flooding. The Arkansas Department of Transportation reported that portions of several state highways across the state, particularly in southeastern Arkansas, were closed due to downed trees, power lines and flooding.

Many streams were already at or near flood levels because of earlier storms, and heavy rains could lead to flash flooding across the region, forecasters said. Parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana were under flash flood warnings or watches on Saturday.

The storm, bringing the threat of ice and snow to the Chicago area, prompted the cancellation of more than 1,200 flights Saturday at Chicago’s two main airports. Most cancellations occurred at Chicago’s O’Hare International, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation’s online flight-tracking website.

The weather service issued a winter weather advisory, flood watch and lakeshore flood warning for the Chicago metropolitan area for Saturday and a winter storm warning for adjacent areas of northwestern Illinois.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7hu5y8/article30548387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SEVEREWEATHERILLINOIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/storms-sweep-southern-us-midwest-as-death-toll-rises-to-11/article30548388.ece

The Saudi personnel being expelled are not accused of aiding the Saudi Air Force second lieutenant who killed three American sailors at the Pensacola installation, CNN reported, quoting unnamed sources.

The Pentagon, the Justice Department, the FBI and the Saudi Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Pentagon announced on Dec. 10 it was halting operational training of all Saudi Arabian military personnel in the United States after the incident. The Pentagon then announced on Dec. 19 that it found no threat in its review of about 850 military students from Saudi Arabia studying in the United States.

64,2020/01/12,UK ambassador to Iran arrested: British government,"Iranian authorities briefly detained Britain's ambassador in Tehran on Saturday, according to Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, after he was reportedly arrested during protests against the regime.

""The arrest of our ambassador in Tehran without grounds or explanation is a flagrant violation of international law,"" Mr. Raab said in a statement after the detention of Rob Macaire.

The minister warned Iran that it was ""at a cross-roads moment"", and had to choose between ""its march towards pariah status"" or ""take steps to de-escalate tensions and engage in a diplomatic path forwards.""

Mr. Macaire was arrested for allegedly ""inciting"" protesters in Tehran angry at the military's accidental downing of a Ukranian passenger jet, killing 176 people, most of them Iranian citizens, according to the Daily Mail.

He was released after around an hour, it added.

President Hassan Rouhani said a military probe into the tragedy had found ""missiles fired due to human error"" brought down the Boeing 737, calling it an ""unforgivable mistake"".

The admission was an ""important first step"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier Saturday.

""We will do everything we can to support the families of the four British victims and ensure they get the answers and closure they deserve,"" he said in a statement issued by his Downing Street office.

Johnson added that Britain would work closely with Canada, Ukraine and other international partners to ensure ""a comprehensive, transparent and independent international investigation and the repatriation of those who died.""

""This tragic accident only reinforces the importance of de-escalating tensions in the region,"" he said.

""It is vital that all leaders now pursue a diplomatic way forward.""

The United States called on Saturday on Iran to apologise for detaining the British ambassador to Tehran, reportedly during protests against the regime.

""This violates the Vienna Convention, which the regime has a notorious history of violating. We call on the regime to formally apologize to the UK for violating his rights and to respect the rights of all diplomats,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus tweeted.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4go4ew/article28497138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AVDMORGANORTAGUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-ambassador-to-iran-arrested-british-government/article30548231.ece

68,2020/01/12,Chinese film festival shuts down amid censorship,"One of China’s longest-running independent film festivals has decided to shut down against the backdrop of mounting government censorship, saying it was no longer possible to run a “purely independent” festival in the country.

The China International Film Festival (CIFF) made the announcement in a post Thursday on its official WeChat social media account.

“We believe that under current local organisational conditions it is impossible to organise an effective film festival that has a pure, independent spirit,” it said.

Restrictions under Xi

The statement gave no other details on the reasons, but the shutdown comes amid a dramatic tightening of censorship on Chinese media and entertainment under President Xi Jinping.

The CIFF was founded in the eastern city of Nanjing in 2003 and was staged 14 times, its announcement said.

The festival was known to have screened films on sensitive subjects such as homosexuality and controversies surrounding the massive Three Gorges Dam project in central China.

Under Mr. Xi, Beijing has ramped up censorship while pushing a nationwide drive for more media that glorifies the ruling Communist Party.

Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post quoted Zhang Xianmin, a Beijing Film Academy professor and the festival’s key organiser, as saying the shutdown takes China back to a more restricted era for film. “We just went back to 20 years ago, when there was no room and opportunity for independent films,” Mr. Zhang was quoted as saying.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-film-festival-shuts-down-amid-censorship/article30545029.ece
69,2020/01/12,Suspected WWII bombs to prompt mass evacuation in Germany’s Dortmund,"Around 13,000 people are to be evacuated from their homes in the German city of Dortmund on January 12 after local authorities identified suspected World War II bombs in the city centre.

The city in Germany’s industrial Ruhr region is to be brought to a standstill by a mass evacuation affecting retirement homes, hospitals and the main train station.

In an online statement, Dortmund city hall said they had identified four locations where they suspect unexploded bombs dropped by Allied forces during World War II are buried.

The suspicions were based on “anomalies” detected during construction projects, the statement said.

“Only an excavation” could confirm the existence of bombs, it added.

Residents within a 500m radius of each location were told to leave their homes by 8:00 am (0700 GMT) on on January 12, with excavation work to begin later in the day.

Preparations were already in full swing on January 11, with 58 patients evacuated by ambulance from two hospitals.

Residents at two retirement homes were also moved to safety a day ahead of the work.

The city hall tweeted images of containers being set in place to form a protective wall around the affected area.

The total area to be evacuated covers a large part of Dortmund's city centre, including the main train station and nearby National Football Museum.

The train station will be closed in the morning on Jan. 12, with trains rerouted to avoid the city.

The unearthing of World War II era bombs is a common occurrence in Germany, but local media claimed this case could be the largest such evacuation ever seen in the Ruhr region.

In 2017, around 65,000 people were temporarily evacuated -- the largest such operation since 1945 -- when a huge British bomb weighing 1.4 tons was discovered in Frankfurt.

Last September, 15,000 people were evacuated from their homes while a 250-kilogramme (550-pound) device was defused in Hanover.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9521br/article30546426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GERMANY-WWII-BOMB-POLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/suspected-wwii-bombs-to-prompt-mass-evacuation-in-germanys-dortmund/article30546427.ece
70,2020/01/12,Explained: How is the Iran air crash being probed?,"The story so far: On January 8, 2020, a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737-800, on a flight from Tehran, Iran to Kiev, Ukraine, a nearly 2,300 km route, fell to the ground after initially climbing to about 8,000 ft. There was no communication from the crew of flight PS752 about unusual conditions. There were no survivors among the 176 passengers and crew. On January 11, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani admitted that internal investigation had concluded that “regrettably missiles fired due to human error caused the horrific crash”. The air accident happened in the backdrop of geopolitical tensions between Iran and the United States.

How far has the investigation progressed?

On January 9, 2020, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB), Civil Aviation Organisation, Islamic Republic of Iran, put out an initial report (State File Number: A981018URPSR) on the “accident”.

It cited witnesses on the ground as well as the crew of overflights reporting an “intensifying fire” on the aircraft before it hit the ground, causing an explosion. It also pointed to crash site track analysis indicating a change in aircraft direction “following a technical problem” and of it returning to the airport.

The AAIB is now in possession of the aircraft’s black boxes, which include the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR). While fire and the impact of the accident have damaged both devices, their “memory parts” are in good condition.

Iran has followed investigatory procedures based on Annex 13 to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the UN body. These include putting out relevant news and information, initiating forensic identification, protecting crash site evidence and sending an initial notifications to Ukraine, the U.S., and also to Sweden, Canada and Afghanistan (as countries of the passengers).

What are black box technologies? What is their role in the investigation?

The Ukrainian aircraft, which was delivered in 2016, is a new generation jet equipped with modern avionics.

Black box manufacturing is now a field populated by multiple manufacturers, the more prominent names being Honeywell Aerospace, L3Harris Technologies and Teledyne. Black boxes are multi-channel recording devices, nowadays solid-state, and no longer tape. Tiny chips record hundreds of streams of data on parameters that include aircraft performance (speed, height, rate of climb or descent, flight path, location, fuel levels, engine temperature and exhaust as well as flap positions), the state of other systems and other equipment. Earlier, data had to be recorded on separate devices, but technology is now advanced to have one device cover a range of data recording functions. Regulation is also moving towards an aircraft having two such devices. Together, the data and cockpit recorders (electronic flight data recorders) help understand the ‘what’, ‘how’ and ‘why’ of the event.

A black box must be able to withstand many accident scenarios. According to the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation, tests include ‘crash tests against concrete at 750 km per hour, withstanding a static load of 2.25 tonnes for at least five minutes, a maximum temperature of 1,100 degrees Celsius for 60 minutes and water pressure at a depth of about 20,000 feet. Modern devices emit signals on contact with salt water (emergency over sea), with a range transmission of 2 km’.

The voice recorder logs almost every sound in the flight deck which includes air traffic control transmissions, crew conversations and even the sounds of switches and engine noise. In newer devices, recording can go up to 120 minutes at a stretch before being overwritten. In modern aircraft, this is automatic.

The data helps experts piece together the cause of an accident or serious incident. Investigators, according to the German bureau, do not have to fully reconstruct a flight. Much of the information needed can be deciphered from the parameters rather than using a flight simulator or animation.

Complete black box analysis can be done only by a few specialised agencies worldwide, especially as there are various models; the West leads in this. Specialised laboratories can pitch in too. The German bureau, for example, can examine western and Russian devices.

Black box analysis can also give rise to controversies. A ‘who best can read them’ situation has often played out in air accidents in developing countries.

In the final analysis, with the impact of some of the more recent air crashes/disappearances, such as Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, in 2014, technology could move in a new direction: of data streaming using cloud-based satellite links and a data centre, cockpit video recorders, or even deployable recorders. The new European Aviation Safety Agency cockpit voice recording mandate, with effect from 2021, requires a 25-hour voice recording capability. All this should help make flying safer and event construction better.

In an air accident investigation, what are the obligations to be followed?

In an email reply to The Hindu, David Learmount, aviation journalist and consulting Editor, FlightGlobal, says accident investigation protocol is that the state in which the accident happened is responsible for seeing that the investigation is carried out according to laid down international rules agreed at ICAO.

So, said Mr. Learmount, Iran is responsible for the investigation, and can exercise control over it. It could contract out specialist tasks, such as downloading the black boxes, to an expert third country such as France — France’s BEA is to take part in the investigation. Normally, the accident investigator of the country that originally certificated the aircraft type (the U.S.) and the manufacturer (Boeing) would be invited to take part.

Pointing out that the aircraft was most likely to have been hit by a missile, Mr. Learmount said, “Mistakes happen.” For example, in 2001, a Siberia Airlines jet, flight 1812, from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk was shot down by the Ukrainian military carrying out firing practice against target drones.

After Iran formally invited the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Boeing to be a part of the investigation team, a senior NTSB official, in another email, said a number of challenges would need to be addressed to allow the NTSB to execute its role effectively. These include “long-standing country embargoes that preclude, among other things, exchange of data and travel, hence its close coordination with the State Department and other U.S. Government agencies”.

Nitin Sarin, Managing Partner (and with inputs from Syed Tamjeed Ahmad, Associate), Sarin & Co., a law firm specialising in aviation law in India, said the investigation is according to the standards and recommended practices as laid down in Annex 13 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention). Every contracting state is required to make domestic laws in this regard. The most important point is that the purpose of an investigation is not to proportion liability of anyone but to find out the cause that led to the crash and prevent it from happening in the future.

Mr. Sarin added: ‘ICAO puts forth Standard and Recommended Practices, which states are expected to adhere to; they have legal basis for enforcement. Article 26 of the Chicago Convention requires the state (in whose jurisdiction the crash has occurred) to institute an inquiry into the cause. Annex 13 also mandates that if a request is made by: 1) state of operator (in this case Ukraine) 2) state of registration (in cases covered by Article 83 bis agreements) 3) state of manufacturer/design (U.S. in this case) for preserving the evidences pending an inquiry instituted by such states, the state where the crash has occurred “shall” comply with such requests. The state where the accident occurs is required to convey the news of the accident at the earliest to 1) state of operator (Ukraine) 2) state of Registration (in cases covered by Article 83 bis agreements) 3) state of manufacturer/design (U.S.) 4) ICAO.’ Thus, under international law, four states participate in an investigation: state where the crash has occurred; state of the operator; the state of registration; state of the manufacturer. The investigation is led by the state where the accident has taken place. For reasons of sovereignty, the state of occurrence has a right to disallow any state from taking part in the ongoing investigation.

In India, the air accident investigation is governed by the Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2012. The Central government is under an obligation (and has the power) to investigate any accident that happens within the territory of India, and in cases of aircraft registered in India even if the accident occurs outside India. The DGCA can only investigate into incidents, and in cases of serious events, the Central government (through the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau) has to step in.

Does ICAO have any authority over a country’s investigation board?

ICAO, said Mr. Sarin, is not directly involved in any aircraft accident investigation. It simply lays down the recommended practices, which states are expected to adhere to. Also, ICAO conducts annual audits of states and publishes its report. Thus, if a state has not adhered to ICAO’s recommended practices it gets bad publicity.

States (where the accident has occurred) have a right to disallow any state from taking part in an ongoing investigation. Thus, the state (where the accident has occurred) can conduct the investigation (including decoding of the black box) independently and this would not render the investigation invalid, provided ICAO’s recommendations are followed. It must be noted that only a few countries, mainly the U.S., the United Kingdom and France possess the proper technology to decode black boxes.

ICAO also releases various updates concerning the safety aspect of aviation, which includes updates on black box technology. Annex 13 requires that the state, which is leading the investigation, should use the black box for the purpose of investigation, according to Mr. Sarin. If it lacks the technological infrastructure required, it should take the assistance of states that are equipped to deal with it.

How is the recreation of the sequence of the crash done? Where does the engine manufacturer fit in?

The recreation of events that led to the crash is done by the investigators and no law requires the recreation to be done at any particular phase of the investigation, said Mr. Sarin. It can be done at any time, whenever the investigators deem fit. On the involvement of the engine manufacturer/s, they have the right to be “apprised” of the outcome of the investigation. But their involvement is at the sole discretion of the state (where the accident has occurred).

On the subject of compensation to passengers and their families, what are the procedures? How do they work in the case of a) it being an accident b) an act of hostility c) an unknown situation. Is there a standard model for compensation? What about additional compensation?

Compensation is governed by various factors. For example, if the flight was on a domestic route. The local consumer laws (many countries have dedicated legislation for compensation in cases of air accidents) shall apply, said Mr. Sarin. But if the flight was operating on an international route, then the compensation shall be governed either by the Montreal Convention or the Warsaw Convention (it depends whether the state of origin and the state of destination have ratified the same conventions or not). But even these conventions just serve as guidance because in many cases (especially in the U.S.) courts often grant exemplary compensations. Further, in most cases involving fatal accidents (the cause of crash does not matter), the operators themselves award compensation based on the latest international (Montreal) convention.

To what extent does an airline’s insurance policies cover eventualities? What is the role of the government of the country the airline belongs to? Does it vary if it is a private airline and a national government flag carrier?

In essence, said Mr. Sarin, it is indeed the insurers of the airline that take care of the compensation part (substantial) and they prefer to pay the amount amicably without involving any litigation. Since in litigation, there are chances that the court may award exemplary compensation and not forget the negative public relations that follows it. It does not matter whether it is a government airline or a private airline. In case of a fatal crash, the government would always want the airline to pay the compensation.

Is there a specific time frame for accident investigation submission?

A preliminary report has to be sent within 30 days of the accident, according to Mr. Sarin. The final report should be submitted preferably within a year, although the time required to complete an investigation can vary depending upon the complexities involved (both technological and geopolitical) in the investigations.

In an accident, is there a separation in terms of the liabilities for the aircraft manufacturer and engine manufacturer?

The liability of an aircraft manufacturer or engine manufacturer can only arise if it is proved that the crash occurred due to the negligence of the manufacturer, said Mr. Sarin. For example, in the recent two crashes involving the Boeing 737MAX (Lion Air of Indonesia in October 2018, and Ethiopian Airlines in March 2019), various inquiries have established that the crashes can be attributed to the faulty design and sensor on the plane, which was installed by the manufacturer, Boeing. Thus, in such a scenario the manufacturer will be held liable. Further, it needs to be highlighted that in aviation, the manufacturers have a “continuous duty to warn” their clients i.e. till the time the aircraft is in service, the manufacturer has a duty to inform the operator about any impending/imminent operational danger and failure to do so shall be attributed as a negligent behaviour on the part of the manufacturer.

Is there any difference if an aircraft is company owned, wet leased, dry leased?

Yes, said Mr. Sarin. There exists a difference in liability if an aircraft is wet-leased. In general, the lessor “should” not be held liable for a crash but in cases of a wet lease, because the lessor maintains operational control over the aircraft, the lessor will be held liable. Moreover, even in general (dry) leases, a lessor can be held liable (for lack of oversight) if the cause of the accident was improper maintenance of aircraft by the operator. But in general terms, the lessors (dry lease) should not be held liable, although there have been cases where lessors have been held liable (example: 2011 judgment of Florida Supreme Court (U.S.) in Vreeland vs. Ferrer). In case the aircraft is owned by the operator then there is no question of ambiguity over the liability.

An act of war, said Mr. Sarin, such as a missile attack, is clearly a mistake and throws up an interesting point of law, i.e. responsibility of the state, as there is an obligation to not perform any act of aggression against a civilian aircraft.

Can a civilian aircraft be brought down by a state?

According to Mr. Sarin, it is never easy for a state to order this. The “law” over this point is not very clear. An amendment in the Chicago convention (many countries including India have not ratified this amendment), provides that states should refrain from exercising the use of weapons against civilian aircraft. But while suggesting that states should refrain from such acts, it does not make the act illegal, provided the state had reasonable reasons to believe that the aircraft was on a destructive path. Legal scholars converge on the point that a state can shoot down an airliner if: 1) it has reason to believe that the aircraft is being used for terror 2) the aircraft is not responding to any other means of interception 3) it is headed towards a strategically important or a populated place. In most cases, if it emerges that the airliner was wrongly judged, the state that took it down makes an ex-gratia compensation to families. For example in the 2001 Siberia Airlines case, after investigations showed Ukraine’s involvement, Ukraine and Israel signed an agreement where the family members of the Israeli citizens were awarded $200,000 each. In 1988, when the U.S. Navy shot down an Iran Air flight (Flight 655), the U.S. was insistent that there was no improper use of force, and thus, it did not have a duty to compensate. It did so later on humanitarian grounds. In all these cases, the states (that shot down) have always pleaded that they had exhausted all other practical means of stopping the intrusion by the aircraft.

The latest in this was the case of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which was shot down over Ukraine in 2014 using a complex BUK missile system, by suspected rebels supported by Russia — although Russia had denied any such involvement. Last year, four international arrest warrants were issued by a court in the Netherlands against the suspects. Thus, in cases where it is found that the airliner was shot down by a state even when it knew that there was no reasonable apprehension of any terror act, the culprit state can be taken to the International Court of Justice.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/aq4hyy/article30545816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THiStock-853486360,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/how-is-the-iran-air-crash-being-probed/article30545818.ece
71,2020/01/12,Deep Impact does have a deep impact,"Comets have been observed by humanity and recorded in human history for ages. Celestial objects consisting of a nucleus of ice and dust and, when near the sun, a tail of dust and gas particles pointing away from the sun, comets were embroiled in superstition until they were studied from a scientific viewpoint in the last few centuries.

It was only in this millennia that we developed enough know-how to target one such comet and deploy an impact probe towards it. The resulting collision, the first such planned event, enabled us to rethink our understanding of the formation of comets and how they work.

Unlike previous NASA flyby missions, the Deep Impact was from the start intended to study the internal composition of a comet. It consisted of two parts: a coffee table-sized main flyby spacecraft that weighed a little over 600 kg and a smaller probe that weighed 372 kg and designed for the impact.

Unique payload

Fitted with some of the latest instruments and cameras, the Deep Impact also had an unusual payload. This was a compact disc as part of a campaign to send names to a comet and held within it the names of 6,25,000 people.

Following its launch on January 12, 2005, Deep Impact was put in a low-Earth orbit, then an elliptical orbit before it headed on an Earth escape trajectory. Nearly six months and 429 million km later, Deep Impact reached Comet 9P/Tempel 1.

Bang on target

On July 3, 2005, the impactor probe was released by Deep Impact to move into the path of the comet. As per plan, on July 4, 2005 (American Independence Day), the probe, which was travelling at a relative velocity of 37,000 km/hr at the time of impact, crashed into Tempel 1. The collision created an explosion the equivalent of 4.26 tonnes of TNT and a crater that was about 150 m in diameter.

Minutes later, the flyby spacecraft passed close-by, clicking images of the crater, ejecta plume and the entire nucleus. Ground-based and space-based observatories also collected information, both about the impact and its results, in a coordinated effort.

Based on these results, scientists were able to conclude that Comet Tempel 1 had probably originated in the Oort Cloud – the most distant region of our solar system. The data also showed that the comet was rather fluffy, with nearly 50% of the nucleus and 75% of the surface shell (the comet as a whole) comprising empty space.

EPOXI mission

Even though Deep Impact’s primary mission was over, it had enough propellant left to get a supplementary mission. This mission came to be known as EPOXI, derived by combining the two components of this mission, Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterisation (EPOCh) and Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI).

After Deep Impact’s new target, Comet 85P/Boethin, was lost as it probably broke up, it was redirected to Comet 103P/Hartley 2. This flyby was achieved in November 2010 and the data collected showed that the two lobes of Hartley 2 were different in composition.

Before getting to Hartley 2, Deep Impact had to perform three Earth flybys over two years. Ahead of the second flyby, it performed the EPOCh mission, investigating extrasolar planets around eight distant stars using its instruments.

Works with Chandrayaan-1

It also utilised this time to better study our Earth, which included collecting enough detail to find out what a habitable world looks like. Along with India’s Chandrayaan-1 and NASA’s Cassini space probe, Deep Impact was also able to reveal the first clear evidence of water on the surface of the moon.

A third target for flyby in 2020 was identified for Deep Impact and the spacecraft was used for remote study of faraway comets in the meantime, but NASA lost touch with it in August 2013. Despite considerable repeated efforts to contact the spacecraft, NASA officially abandoned efforts to contact Deep Impact on September 20, 2013.

In its operational period of over eight years, Deep Impact produced way more data than had been planned and enhanced our understanding, especially about comets.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/u29bgf/article30478210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12istbDeepImpactartistjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/deep-impact-does-have-a-deep-impact/article30478213.ece

In response to Mr. Narayanasamy’s statement that the Lt. Governor was trying to anoint her Officer on Special Duty G. Theva Neethi Dhas as the SEC, Ms. Bedi said “it was only a figment of his imagination.”

“I wish to tell you [Chief Minister] that my OSD, Theva Neethi Dhas is not separable to take up any other assignment as long as I am the Lt. Governor of Puducherry. He is indispensable to the Lt.

“He provides this office critical institutional memory so essential for me personally, coming from outside the region. Hence, please stop spreading falsehood through media as my office needs his services in view of his integrity, vast experience and capability. He too is not interested in any such posts,” she said.

Urging Mr. Narayanasamy to redeem the reputation of the Chief Minister’s Office, Ms. Bedi said the “people of Puducherry deserve to have a trusting Chief Minister.”

Kudumbashree plans to bring products of at least 1,000 micro-entrepreneurs to the market through the 1,546 Supplyco outlets across the State. Kudumbashree and Supplyco have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in this regard.

The contract between Kudumbashree and Supplyco has two parts. As per the first, Kudumbashree entrepreneurs will pack ‘puttupodi’ and ‘appam podi’ (rice powders) under the Sabari brand of Supplyco, besides umbrella under the Kudumbashree brand. Coconut oil too will reach the outlets. Kudumbashree will hand over the required quantity of these products to Supplyco as per fixed rates.

As per the second part of the contract, products manufactured by the Kudumbashree micro-enterprises will be stocked under their respective brands in the Supplyco outlets. The approved products will be supplied by the micro-enterprises to any of the 56 regional depots of Supplyco nearby and from there reach the outlets.

Registration forms

For this, the micro-entrepreneurs will have to fill registration forms with details and quantities of products they can supply to Supplyco as a ‘fast-moving consumer good.’ The forms will be collected before January 30 and handed over to Supplyco. Only after the first batch of products is sold out and Supplyco demands more products will the next lot will be delivered.

79,2020/01/12,Visit Manaveeyam today for art and music steeped in politics,"Pursuing a career in independent music is almost like being on a boat alone without an oar, with the shore nowhere in sight. Even getting a space to perform is a struggle, with sponsors keeping off anything which is not mainstream. Amid this state of affairs, a group of musicians from the city have taken it upon themselves to organise a full-fledged music festival by way of crowd-funding. The festival, titled ‘Concentration Camp Music Festival’, to be hosted at the Manaveeyam Veedhi here on Sunday from 10 a.m. to midnight, is as much a political statement in the current scenario, as it is a statement of the power of the collective. Six bands of varying genres, including Malayalam rock bands Avial and Eettillam, thrash metal band Chaos, experimental music projects ‘Olam’ and ‘Collective Conscious’ and Shinkari melam by Thalam Vadya Kala Samithi.

Why the event

“We began planning this festival as a New Year event titled ‘trivolume’. But then, the political situation and the protests made us think of turning this into something more than a mere music festival. Our friends as well as music buffs pitched in with funds. We have kept the entry free for everyone,” says Devan Narayanan, an organiser and the vocalist of ‘Collective Conscious’.

The festival would also mark the homecoming gig for ‘Chaos’, a band known for its politically charged songs, which was formed in the city 15 years ago.

Comeback gig

“It has been five years since we performed in our own city. In this period, we released our second album, has almost completed work on the third and performed across the country. There is no better place to have this comeback gig than Manaveeyam Veedhi, where we all used to assemble every evening, during our early days,” says Jayakrishnan, vocalist of ‘Chaos’.

The music performances, which begin in the evening, form just a part of the festival. In the mornings, several events have been lined up, including a poster exhibition titled ‘frame of unity’, a photography exhibition ‘Illogical’, and an anti-plastic awareness campaign ‘Mannum Manassum Manushyanum Plasticum’, with the group ‘Recycle Bin’ presenting artworks based on the theme. A ‘jam house’ will also be set up in the street, complete with live instruments, for anyone interested in displaying their music skills.

The entire festival will be organised as per the green protocol.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/fvgmww/article30546295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12tvchaos,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/visit-manaveeyam-today-for-art-and-music-steeped-in-politics/article30546296.ece
80,2020/01/12,Eateries struggle with plastic ban,"More than a week after the ban on single use plastic, it is the owners of restaurants and wayside eateries who are struggling to make the shift, with many still clueless on a proper alternative for plastic pouches used to pack curries. While some have started experimenting with alternatives like the one made from potato starch or containers made of aluminium foil, several shops still continue to use the silver-coloured multi-layer plastic, which is also banned.

“We have already started using packaging material made of potato starch, in place of plastic materials, supplied by a Delhi-based company. It costs a little more and its durability is not known. But, we are told that it would decompose easily and blend in with the soil. But, I think, they should allow the use of special grade plastic, which can be recycled or used for purposes like road tarring,” says Sanal K.S., owner of Mother’s Veg Plaza at Bakery Junction.

Some restaurants like Zam Zam at YMR Junction had begun using carry bags made of cloth, much before the ban came into effect. “After the ban, we have changed our plastic spoons and forks and started using wooden ones. For parcelling juice, we use cups and straws made of paper. Aluminium foil covers are used to pack the food stuff, including the curries,” said the manager of the restaurant.

Many of the wayside eateries and restaurants have begun using plantain leaf for packing dosa and parotta, instead of the typical plastic wrapping. But most of them still depend on multi-layer plastic for packing curries. A person running a wayside eatery insisted that such material is not banned. However, Corporation officials maintain that it poses a health hazard and is on the list of banned materials.

“Aluminium foil containers are permitted for packing curries. There is no reason why the shops should continue to use multi-layer plastics,” said a Health official.

Though the Corporation had suggested that the restaurants and food delivery operators shift to reusable steel containers for food delivery, they are yet to get a favourable response.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/eateries-struggle-with-plastic-ban/article30546266.ece
81,2020/01/12,KU’s sole self-financing engg. college in trouble,"The University College of Engineering (UCE), Karyavattom, the sole self-financing engineering college under the University of Kerala, is staring at an uncertain future.

Situation in the college has worsened ever since the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) denied sanction for its nine NRI seats in the 2018-19 academic year, owing to the university’s inability to implement the sixth pay commission scale for UCE employees. The college reported a loss of ₹46 lakh by way of running expenses that year.

The university’s continued failure to rectify the deficiency prompted the AICTE to halve the college’s student intake in the 2019-20 academic year. While UCE has a sanctioned strength of 198 seats, the college was permitted to fill only 99 seats, among which 92 were filled in its three streams of Computer Science and Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, and Information Technology. In its order served in April, the AICTE also threatened further action if the university failed to address the issue within six months.

Legal options

Subsequently, the Syndicate decided to pursue legal options against the AICTE order, even while admitting students from the merit category in the available seats. A subcommittee was also constituted to study a pay structure proposed by the UCE staff, numbering around 65 of which 47 are faculty members.

According to official sources, the implementation of the sixth pay commission recommendations is expected to create an additional financial burden of ₹12 lakh per month for the university. The crisis will worsen further with the seventh pay commission report. The employees have been on agitation mode, demanding hike in their salaries and steps to address problems. The recommendations of the subcommittee will be taken up for discussion at the Syndicate meeting scheduled on Monday.

The MGU solution?

Under the circumstances, the university is actively pursuing the idea of emulating Mahatma Gandhi University (MGU), which had transferred its self-financing college, University College of Engineering in Muttom, Idukki, to the Centre for Professional and Advanced Studies, a society formed to manage the institution. A recent meeting convened by Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel also suggested allocating a particular amount in the university budget to clear the deficiencies reported by the AICTE.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kus-sole-self-financing-engg-college-in-trouble/article30546237.ece
82,2020/01/12,Temporary bus stands lack basic amenities,"The temporary bus stands set up to ease congestion ahead of Pongal festival lack basic amenities, rue users.

Two bus stands, one near Sona Mina theatre complex on Williams Road and the other at Mannarpuram, will function till January 20, the city police had said.

Buses bound for Pudukottai and Madurai will ply from Mannarpuram bus stand while those going to Thanjavur will be operated from Williams Road.

All mofussil buses from southern districts and Pudukottai, operating via Tiruchi, will function out of the temporary bus stand at Mannarpuram. All other outstation buses will be operated from the Central Bus stand.

Private operators will, as usual, drop and pick up passengers at the omni bus stand.

Lack of basic facilities at the temporary bus shelters has caused discomfiture to passengers.

“There is no shelter for protection from harsh heat during daytme. We have to resort to hunting for a spot in the shade to keep our bags and wait for the bus,” said P. Roshan, who was waiting for a bus to Thanjavur.

The buses lined up on the congested road added to the inconvenience as it caused traffic snarls.

“Vehicles dropping off passengers, including autos were not allowed to park there. Vehicles taking this route regularly were caught in the traffic jam,” said Mr. Roshan.

At the bus stand at Mannarpuram, too, the situation was similar.

“There is no shelter, neither are there any temporary restroom facilities. Men have been urinating on the walls even as women wait nearby,” said M. Lokavarshini, a passenger.

“There is no shade. Women with children struggle a lot,” she said.

The inadequacy of the central bus stand is the reason for these problems, said a passenger.

“The setting up of temporary bus stands is recent. Until five years ago, there was no need for it. However, after the central bus stand became inadequate to deal with the increasing crowds, such bus stands were set up during Deepavali and Pongal. Had there been an integrated bus stand like in Madurai, the passengers would be able to travel comfortably,” he added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/qekv8v/article30551090.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY13-TEMPORARYBUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/temporary-bus-stands-lack-basic-amenities/article30551091.ece

A few days after the meeting, Koovathur panchayat has initiated the process of installing a chain of surveillance cameras covering vantage areas in the village.

With active involvement of locals, the exercise was launched on Saturday when the first of the 24 advanced cameras was installed in the presence of Andimadam police.

Installation of the remaining cameras is expected to be completed soon and the network will linked to Andimadam police station through cable, said a police officer.

Koovathur panchayat comprises 10 villages and the plan is to initially install the cameras covering important roads and other locations, panchayat president E. David said.

It will be done through sponsors, he added.

The cameras will be of advanced version, with facility to capture even the number plate of a vehicle, said the police officer.

More cameras are to be installed in phase-II covering additional vantage spots inside the villages of the panchayat, said Mr. David.

Police sources say awareness among people in rural Andimadam of the need to install cameras is increasing and many have installed the gadgets as a crime prevention measure.

Cameras have already been installed in rural pockets under Andimadam police station limits such as Vilanthai, Kavarapalayam and Pattinamkurichi.

The Andimadam police station alone has under 20 panchayats under its limits.

During the meeting with the newly elected panchayat presidents, the Andimadam police appealed to them to inform law enforcers about movement of suspicious elements in their villages and any illegal activity including sale of lottery tickets and sand smuggling.

The local body representatives were also asked to extend full cooperation to police whenever there is a law and order problem.

From Kallakudi on the periphery of Tiruchi-Ariyalur district to Chidambaram, the stretch has a number of industries. Most of them are in Ariyalur and Cuddalore districts. For quick implementation, the ₹2,500-crore project has been divided into three parts. While package-I covers Tiruchi and Kallagam, package-II links Kallagam and Meensuriti. Package-III covers the stretch between Meensuriti in Ariyalur district and Chidambaram in Cuddalore district.

While there were no major issues in packages I and III, package-II ran into trouble due to many factors including stiff resistance from farmers and landholders to land acquisition from Kallagam and Meensuriti. It forced NHAI to terminate the package a few months ago. It urged the State government to speed up land acquisition to restart work.

NHAI has now called for a new tender for forming an extended two-way with paved shoulder between Meensuriti and Kallagam at an estimate of about ₹500 crore.

NHAI sources told The Hindu that package-II of the Tiruchi-Chidambaram National Highway project had been revised. January 30 would be the last date to submit tender proposals. It was expected that the project would be awarded in March or April. The revised estimate was slightly higher than the original estimate of about ₹482 crore. If everything went well, road work between Meensuriti and Kallagam would begin in May.

As far as the stretch between Mathur, situated on the outskirts of Tiruchi, and Kallagam is concerned, the road work had picked up pace. While ground levelling was on at various locations, construction of culvert and bridges had been taken up in some other locations.

“We are happy to note the good pace of work between Kallagam and Tiruchi. The project will be a major boost to cement industries in Ariyalur and Tiruchi districts to transport the finished products to Chennai and other parts of the State,” said Subbaiah, Deputy General Manager, Dalmia Cement, Dalmiapuram.

Once road work was over, it would enable the cement factories to reach Tiruchi-Chennai NH 45 stretch directly without travelling through a number of hamlets and villages. It would save time and fuel.

A NHAI official said 20% of work had been completed from Tiruchi to Kallagam. It was 10% from Meensuriti to Chidambaram. Since the rainy season was over, work would gain pace in the weeks to come.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/nhai-floats-re-tender-for-package-ii-of-tiruchi-chidambaram-highway-project/article30550347.ece

87,2020/01/12,Pollution board appeals for smokeless Bhogi,"The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) on Sunday urged Pongal revellers not to burn tyres, tubes and plastics.

On Bhogi, people in villages light bonfire with logs of wood, cow-dung cakes, other solid fuels and wooden furniture that were no longer useful. In cities, however, bonfires are made with old tyres and tubes, plastics, old mats, broomstick, garbage and other harmful material, thereby increasing the levels of pollutants such as “PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 and NO 2” in the atmosphere, TNPCB said in a press release.

Exposure to such particles could affect the heart and lungs, and long-term exposure to particulate pollution could result in significant health problems including increased respiratory symptoms such as irritation of the nasal airways, coughing or difficulty in breathing and decreased lung functions. Among other ill-effects, burning during Bhogi caused formation of smog, which resulted in poor visibility and disrupted traffic of rail, road and air transport.

89,2020/01/12,ISL 2019-20 | Kerala Blasters snap ATK’s unbeaten run,"Halicharan Narzary scored the all-important goal as Kerala Blasters made a two-in-two against ATK, bringing an end to the home side’s unbeaten run, in their second leg Indian Super League match at the Saltlake Stadium in Kolkata on Sunday.

Narzary took the possession of the ball around the 30-yard mark and surged past the ATK defenders, creating room for himself before slotting it past TP Rehenesh with a powerful right footer in the 70th minute to break the deadlock.

ATK went all out for an equaliser and in the dying moments, Roy Krishna struck one from Javier Hernandez free kick but the home side captain found himself in an off-side trap.

This was an opportunity for ATK to avenge their 1-2 loss on the opening day but Kerala Blasters surprisingly dominated with more possession, continuing their new-found momentum.

Kerala had managed to break their nine-match winless run in their previous game where they thrashed Hyderabad FC 5-1.

With consecutive wins, Kerala now have 14 points from 12 matches. ATK have 21 points from 12, in the top-three of the standings.

ATK came out with more intensity in the second half but it was Kerala Blasters who got the better chances in this session. In the 63rd minute, Ogbeche’s header just about missed the target.

In the 69th minute, ATK went for the perfect team goal but they could not finish off the move.

The first half saw exciting football but none of them could penetrate the opposition citadel.

In the 28th minute, Messi Bouli’s shot was deflected just wide for a corner.

The intensity of the match kicked up a notch as Mario Arques elbowed Prabir Das and got a yellow card for that.

In the 35th minute, Roy Krishna almost put the home side ahead with a header but skipper Bartholomew Ogbeche was at the goal-line to clear the ball away for a corner.

In the 42nd minute, Armando Sosa Pena took a free-kick from just outside the box but his attempt went agonisingly off the target.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/x8sp8l/article30551750.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KERALABLASTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/indian-super-league-2019-20-atk-vs-kerala-blasters-match/article30551751.ece
90,2020/01/12,Roca to replace Brown as HFC coach,"Debutant Hyderabad FC (HFC), which had a forgetful season so far in the Hero ISL, has a new coach in Albert Roca, starting from the 2020-21 season.

According to the team management, Roca will replace the incumbent head coach Phil Brown and this was not surprising given the fact that Hyderabad FC has just one win from its first 12 games so far and is at the bottom of the table with just five points in the ongoing edition.

The team officials have also said that they have signed a two-year contract with Roca and he will be at the helm till the end of the 2021-22 season.

“Albert Roca will advise the new coaching staff for the remainder of the ongoing season and will take full charge from the beginning of next season.”

Roca is no stranger to India and the ISL.

“India is special to me and I am delighted to go back to the ISL. The road ahead is a challenging one and I am excited to get started at Hyderabad FC and build a strong team for next season and beyond,” Roca said in a statement on Sunday.

“The intent from the club is strong and we will put our best efforts and compete to be at the top next season,” he added.

The former FC Barcelona assistant coach led Bengaluru FC to the AFC Cup Finals, making it the first Indian club to reach the final of a continental competition. In his tenure at BFC, apart from leading the club to an ISL final, the outfit also won the Federation Cup and the Super Cup titles.

“We are extremely delighted that Albert Roca has signed with the club. He has tremendous experience across the world and in Albert, we have one of the best coaches to have coached in India,” Varun Tripuraneni, co-owner of HFC, said.

“We are looking forward to work with Albert and his team and provide him the best support.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/roca-to-replace-brown-as-hfc-coach/article30550155.ece
91,2020/01/12,Liverpool 1-0 Tottenham Hotspur | Reds go 16 points clear as Firmino nets winner against Spurs,"Liverpool stretched their lead at the top of the Premier League to 16 points and set a record in the process as Roberto Firmino's first-half goal secured a battling 1-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.Jürgen Klopp

Jürgen Klopp’s unbeaten side were not at their best and had to withstand a Spurs fightback after the break but hung on for a 20th win out of 21 league games this season to move further ahead of second-placed Leicester City with a game in hand.

Liverpool's total of 61 points is the most after 21 games of a Premier League season, beating Manchester City's 59 from two seasons ago, and has never been surpassed in the Spanish, Italian, German or French leagues at the same stage.

Firmino's 37th-minute effort proved enough for Liverpool to march on towards a first English title since 1989-90, but Tottenham substitute Giovani Lo Celso wasted a glorious chance to earn the hosts a draw with a glaring late miss.

Liverpool's fans stood to acclaim their side at the end and Spurs manager Jose Mourinho, who has now won only two of 11 games against Liverpool boss Juergen Klopp, shook hands with every opposition player at the final whistle.

“I'm over the moon about the result, but we have to talk about the performance,” a rather subdued Klopp said later.

“One team deserved to win and that was us. To win at Tottenham is pretty special. That the game wasn't decided after 50-60 minutes was our fault. We should have scored more goals.

“We were on the ground towards the end. A couple of our players were slightly exhausted, but we fought through that,” he added after his side stretched their lead over Leicester, who had earlier lost 2-1 at home to Southampton.

Club record

While Klopp's unstoppable side are now unbeaten in a club record 38 league games, Tottenham, who in June faced Liverpool in the Champions League final in Madrid, are drifting in eighth place, nine points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.

Liverpool dominated the first half and it needed a superb block by Tottenham's 20-year-old defender Japhet Tanganga, handed his first league start, to deny Firmino with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain hitting the rebound against the post.

Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk then looked certain to head in Jordan Henderson's dinked cross but keeper Paulo Gazzaniga made a superb reflex save.

With Tottenham sitting deeper and deeper the pressure finally told as they failed to clear the ball and Mohamed Salah's pass evaded Tanganga for Brazilian Firmino to fire past the stranded Gazzaniga.

Spurs, without their injured talisman Harry Kane, were far more lively after the break as Liverpool's pace slowed.

Son Heung-min wasted a great chance to equalise, curling the ball over the bar after Liverpool were caught in possession, and then substitute Giovani Lo Celso somehow missed the target with the goal gaping after being picked out by Serge Aurier.

Erik Lamela also came off the bench and tested Liverpool keeper Alisson but the Reds showed incredible defensive discipline to record a sixth successive clean sheet.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/rdxe8l/article30547007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12-FIRMINO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/liverpool-1-0-tottenham-hotspur-reds-go-16-points-clear-as-firmino-nets-winner-against-spurs/article30547008.ece

93,2020/01/12,Raja alleges bid to convertIndia into ‘Hindu rashtra’,"CPI national general secretary D. Raja has alleged that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) are a part of the attempts by BJP-RSS combine and Modi-Shah duo to convert India into a ‘Hindu rashtra’ and a ‘theocratic state’.

Making India a ‘Hindu Rashtra’ would be calamitous and every individual should oppose it as there would be no place for democratic rights in such a society and citizenship would be decided on religious grounds.

Addressing a public meeting on CAA, NPR and NRC organised by ‘Loukika Rajyanga Parirakshana Vedika’ here on Saturday, Mr. Raja stated that citizenship was debated and defined not on the streets but in the Constituent Assembly of India by the likes of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who arrived at a consensus that religion should not form the basis for it.

In fact, the Preamble to the Constitution started as ‘we, the people of India’ and not in the name of Hindus, Muslims, Christians etc. It was envisaged as a secular democratic republic.

Dr. Raja asked if those who faced religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan were to be given Indian citizenship, why were the Tamil people in Sri Lanka remained refugees for nearly three decades.

‘A concern for all’

“CAA is not a question concerning only Muslims but people of all religions,” the CPI leader, asserting that he was indeed a member of the ‘tukde tukde gang’, one who would strive to tear part the BJP and its mentor RSS.

He also accused the BJP of pushing Kashmir into turmoil by abrogating Articles 35-A and 370.

98,2020/01/12,Ask us: Investment options,"Investment options

Q. I am 23 years old and started my career in a fintech organisation last year. I earn ₹50,000 per month excluding my PF contribution (₹3,200). My monthly expenditure is about ₹18,000. I want to start my own venture in about 5-8 years’ time. I also have retirement savings in mind. Please suggest suitable investment options.

Manisha Jayson

A. If you have plans to quit employment and start your own venture, apart from investing towards the initial capital contribution to your venture, it would also be important to protect yourself from emergencies and set up a corpus to take care of your living expenses during the break (until your venture turns a profit). This is apart from investing towards goals such as retirement. From your query, it appears that you can save about ₹32,000 every month. As a first step, if you don’t have health insurance offered by your employer, we suggest you take one so that medical emergencies don’t dent your savings.

A premium of ₹5,000 a year can fetch you a reasonable cover. We also urge you to set up an emergency fund equal to nine months’ living expenses, which would be ₹1.62 lakh in your case. This money should be in safe options such as fixed deposits with a leading bank. If you have money idling in your savings account or elsewhere, earmark it towards this emergency fund. If you don’t, we suggest that you invest ₹5,000 each month until you get to this number. Thereafter, this money can go into your retirement plan. To get to a sizeable corpus, aggressive hybrid equity funds or multicap equity funds would be your best bet.

An 8-year time frame may be essential to earn a reasonable return from these vehicles. If you are conservative, consider three aggressive hybrid equity funds with a good 10-year record for your SIPs. Assuming you make an 8% compounded return, that will give you a corpus of about ₹33 lakh in 8 years’ time. If you have a higher risk appetite, you can invest in three multi-cap equity funds with a good 10-year record. At an assumed 10% return, this will get you to a corpus of about ₹37 lakh at the end of 8 years. How much of this money you would like to invest in the venture and how much you would like to use for your income needs would be up to you. To make a start on your retirement plan, you must open a PPF and NPS account and start contributing whatever savings you have left after the above investments, towards your retirement. Future savings from increases in income and surpluses from your venture must also go into your retirement investments.

For high returns

Q. I am 24 and earn ₹10 lakh a year. I invest ₹1.5 lakh in PPF and spend ₹1.5 lakh towards personal expenses. That leaves me with ₹7 lakh per annum to invest. I'm ready to take extreme risks. I'm already investing in stocks and mutual funds. Can you guide me on other investment options which can yield high returns? Or is to okay to park the entire money in stocks and mutual funds?

Naren Babu

A. To start with, do set up an emergency fund made up of about 9 months’ living expenses. In your case, that would amount to about ₹1.12 lakh, which you need to hold in fixed deposits at a leading bank. If you have dependants, you should buy a pure term insurance plan to take care of them in your absence. If you are not covered by your employer, it is also essential to get a health insurance plan so that your savings don’t take a hit if you have medical emergencies.

After you fund these necessities, you can decide how much of your surpluses you can invest in equity and fixed income. This allocation must be based on your risk appetite as well as financial need. Stocks or equity mutual funds would not be suitable for any financial need which is likely to crop up in less than 5 years’ time. If you have such goals, invest in short-duration debt funds towards such goals. For goals that will crop up in 5-7 years, use aggressive hybrid equity funds that invest in a mix of debt and equity. For goals beyond 7 years, you can rely on stocks and pure equity funds. Continue with your PPF investments as a part of your fixed income allocation.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ask-us-investment-options/article30545612.ece
99,2020/01/12,When to choose a whole life insurance policy over a term policy,"A Whole Life policy is just that. It offers life insurance cover throughout the life of the insured.

Earlier we saw how a Term policy works. It covers against the risk of death during a specified term and has no maturity or survival benefit once that term is over. Usually there is an upper limit of 65 or 70 years of age.

A Whole Life policy, on the other hand, covers the life assured through their natural life. Companies do define this variously as up to age 99 or age 100.

Unlike a Term policy which is a highly focussed policy as described above, the Whole Life policy can have various features. Should the life assured die, the payment is made to the nominee and if they survive the policy date, the policy gets converted into an endowment which pays out on their passing away.

The Whole Life policy would cost more than the Term policy, naturally, and you should be able to sustain the premium payment until age 100 or so. Apart from options for regular premiums for the entire term of the policy, limited premium paying terms are available and one can choose from them depending on income flows. Single premium policies are also available.

Choose a Whole Life policy when you have dependants and when your responsibilities towards them will extend to your super senior years. Should you assess that your children, for example, will be standing on their own feet by the time you retire, a term policy until age 60 or 65 would be a better option.

A Whole Life policy can also be a mechanism to fund funeral arrangements. Morbid as it may sound, more people are thinking through such responsibilities rather than leaving it to those left behind to contend with and do their best. The Whole Life policy comes with various options that you should consider. There can be a simple life cover without any bonus — called a non-participating or non-par policy. On the other hand, a participating policy partakes of the profits the company makes on investing the premium collected under the policy and offers you a share of it as a bonus.

The policy can also be unit-linked. This denotes that the policy premium is invested in the capital markets and the investment risk is yours. There would be portfolio options to choose from, appropriate to your risk appetite.

A Whole Life policy can also have riders and some examples are Accidental Death Benefit, Terminal Illness, Critical Illness and Permanent Disability. A rider is an additional cover that can be purchased with the main policy and, only at the time of buying the main policy. That coverage comes at a lower cost than it would otherwise, by virtue of the fact that it is an add-on cover.

Loans possible

Another benefit of Whole Life policy over Term policy is that a policy loan can be taken as there is a surrender value.

A Term policy, on the other hand, serves as a better tool for backing up a housing loan, protecting the family from loan repayment should the bread-winner die.

Some policies also allow the death benefit to be given to the beneficiary as a lump sum or as a periodical payment. The policy pay out is exempt from income tax. Premium payments also attract a tax benefit under Section 80C of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

As with any insurance decision, clarity on why you want the coverage will help you decide the right policy.

Comex gold gained about 15% in 2019, which is the biggest annual gain since 2010. The international gold price gained 3.4% in December to close at $1,523.1 an ounce. Comex silver rose 5.6% to settle at $17.92 an ounce.

In India, the price of gold futures at MCX gained 2.8% in December to close at ₹39,108 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures too ruled firm and gained 4.9% in December to end at ₹46,711 per kg.

The year 2020 has begun on a positive for precious metals as mounting tensions in West Asia stoked positive sentiment. Gold price jumped to an almost 7-year high a few days ago, before easing off in the last couple of days.

After several weeks of consolidation, the price action in the past few weeks indicates that precious metals have regained their sheen.

The short-term outlook for Comex gold is positive and the price could rise to the immediate resistance of $1,625-1,630 an ounce.

The recent spike in Comex gold has, however, pushed the price to an overbought zone. This could trigger consolidation or a cool-off before the next leg of the up-trend resumes. A breakout past $1,575 would indicate that the cool-off phase is over, and the price could then head to the target of $1,625. The outlook for gold would be positive until the support at $1,480-1,485 is not breached. The short-term outlook for silver is bullish too. A breakout past the immediate resistance at $18.6 would strengthen the positive outlook for silver. Above $18.6, Comex silver could rise to its short-term target of $19.4-19.5 an ounce. The short-term positive outlook would warrant reassessment on a close below the support level at $17.2.

Outlook for MCX gold and silver too appears positive. Gold futures price at MCX is likely to rise to the short-term target of ₹41,600-41,800 per 10 gm. The positive view would be under threat if the price falls below the support zone at ₹38,600-38,800.

Silver price could move to the immediate target in the ₹48,900-49,500 zone. There is strong support for silver at ₹44,500-45,000. A close below ₹44,500 would invalidate the positive outlook and could push MCX silver price to ₹42,500-43,000 per kg.

101,2020/01/12,Is your equity portfolio hurting you?,"If you think I am going to provide a panacea for equity market volatility, I am afraid I have none.

I think most of you have very little reason to complain. This is because for the vast majority (going by the savings data of the country), equity accounts for 5-10% your overall investments. When I say investments, I include deposits, real estate, insurance (if you are using it as an investment) and gold. And, a majority of this is in deposits, going by RBI’s data on the quantum of individual deposits.

So, why, then, would the market volatility cause you so much pain? Simply because that is the only moving part in your portfolio. It swings all the time! And more importantly, it is so easy for you to track it every hour of the day, every single day!

Take it in your stride

While it is important that your equity performs well over the long term for those kicker returns, it is equally important for you not to miss the forest for the trees. Instead of ruing over the negative returns in one small-cap fund, you will do well to look at the tiny blip it caused to your overall investments.

If you cannot deal with this volatility, you are better off shifting even the existing 5-10% into your other investments that you either cannot track or which don’t swing wildly. It is not worth doing much planning, market timing, reading, and constantly acting, really! For, there is no way you can eliminate such movements.

In my experience, a small proportion of investors — a growing number, though — build their portfolios primarily using equities (stocks or funds or NPS). They genuinely believe that only equity will help fulfil their long-term aspirations and build wealth.

There are a few things that this class of investors can do to reduce the volatility in their portfolio through the simple strategy of diversification.

Higher risk, higher swings: Most equity investors believe that mid- and small-cap stocks or funds are the real wealth builders and often go overboard on these segments; holding over 50% of their portfolio in them. Now the issue is, these wealth builders can be wealth destroyers too! And even if you held good mid or small-cap funds, if they lose the plot in a fall, it may take a good while to climb up again. Hence, going overboard on the riskiest of the risky asset class is not a good idea for long-term wealth building. Even a 15-25% holding in these segments can boost your portfolio.

The same holds good for sector or thematic investing too. Sectors become conspicuous at their peak. So, often, your entry point goes amiss. While sectors such as banking or consumer goods may not lose their flavour as they are the core of any economy, other cyclical sectors or commodity segments need timing of entry and exit. If you miss the bus, you not only lose an opportunity to build wealth but also suffer from opportunity loss by holding them.

Not flashy asset classes but diversifiers: In the past 3 years, some investors who held gold may have exited it, totally disenchanted with the returns. But gold surprised in 2019 with a more than 20% returns as global turmoil and trade wars meant investors sought refuge in the metal. But the problem, as I have observed, is this: most people invest in gold seeking high returns and exit disappointed. Gold failed to even beat debt for almost three years until 2019. But one fine day, it stood tall, protecting your portfolio from the equity volatility. It may again go back to oblivion after such glory. This is the limited purpose of gold. If that appeals to you, use it to diversify with some 10-15% exposure and not to gain top returns.

Hedge with global exposure: Did you know that over the past three years, the U.S. markets outperformed India? But very few among you would hold this class of funds or stocks.

Here again, the problem is that you tend to go overboard with such options when performance is at a peak and ditch them when Indian markets return to firm. That is a flawed approach when you use them as a diversification option. Two things help with this kind of investment: one, you get to invest in a market outside India and hence diversify. Second, if you are spending in dollars for future goals such as children’s education, this can provide some natural currency hedge.

Get a bit passive: Finally, if everything seems unclear, having some exposure to index, through funds or ETFs, will ensure that you at least stay with the market. This is not an option that agents or relationship managers will suggest. So, seek it yourself for at least 10% of your portfolio.

After all this, there would still be volatility! Deal with it. If I should sound more intellectual, learn to be ‘antifragile’. That’s the term from Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s book “Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder”. Taleb says we should be antifragile — let shocks and disruptions make you stronger and help you adapt to newer challenges. And, always, look at your overall portfolio performance when you look to see how your investments are doing. Remember the forest and the trees!

102,2020/01/12,Apparel Export Promotion Council eyes 10% rise this fiscal,"The Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) is looking at a 10% rise in garment exports in the short term.

A. Sakthivel, the newly-elected chairman of the council, said the immediate focus was on 10% growth and that for the next fiscal, the sector could be looking at a 15% increase.

“If we get pending export incentives from the government immediately, we can get more orders from overseas buyers in the next two months,” he said.

Garment exports last financial year came to approximately $16.5 billion.

Mr. Sakthivel added the Centre had announced that the MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) would continue till December-end.

Exporters used to get 3.8-4.8% benefit from the scheme. They placed orders taking it into account while working out the costs. However, funds have not been disbursed under MEIS.

The government later announced the Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies scheme.

The AEPC and the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council submitted data to the government on the taxes that exporters pay so that these could be reimbursed under the scheme. However, that too is yet to be implemented.

This has hit working capital availability for exporters. Mr. Sakthivel said the Centre had assured him that these would be addressed soon.

To improve export competitiveness, the AEPC also plans to study the products and markets that Vietnam and Cambodia supply to in apparels. Garment exports are surging for both countries and India should work to compete with them, Mr. Sakthivel said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/apparel-export-promotion-council-eyes-10-rise-this-fiscal/article30545525.ece
103,2020/01/12,Delhi BJP seeks ₹500 crore in damages from AAP for tweeting Tiwari’s edited video,"Delhi BJP on Sunday complained to the Election Commission and sent a defamation notice to AAP seeking ₹500 crore in damages after it tweeted a video that showed Manoj Tiwari dancing to the tune of Aam Aadmi Party’s campaign song for the forthcoming assembly polls.

The video appears to be an edited version of Tiwari’s Bhojpuri albums with “Lage Raho Kejriwal” soundtrack.

“Who gave AAP the right to use my videos for its theme song for the polls,” Mr. Tiwari asked.

The Delhi BJP president claimed that AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is “baffled” by the prospects of his party’s defeat in the assembly polls, scheduled on February 8.

Mr. Tiwari said a complaint has been made to the Election Commission about the video, and Rs 500 crore has been sought as damages for defamation and violations of intellectual property rights.

Delhi BJP’s media relations head Neelkant Bakshi said the use of Tiwari’s face in election campaign by AAP shows he is more popular than Kejriwal.

104,2020/01/12,SC to hear challenge against insolvency ordinance,"The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Monday a challenge against the newly promulgated Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance of 2019, which does not allow homebuyers to individually initiate insolvency proceedings against builders in residential projects.

Section 3 of the ordinance prescribes a minimum threshold for initiating insolvency resolution proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

The ordinance, which was promulgated on December 28 last year, mandates that NCLT need to take cognisance only if it receives an application for insolvency process jointly filed by 10% or 100 in number of the total allottees/homebuyers, whichever is lesser, from the same real estate project.

The petition filed by a homebuyer, Manish Kumar, represented by senior advocate Aishwarya Bhati and advocates Akash Vajpai and Vaibhav Manu Srivastav, wants the apex court to immediately stay the implementation of the ordinance.

Retrospective effect

The petition pointed out that the ordinance has a retrospective effect. Homebuyers who had filed their own individual applications for insolvency process before the NCLT now have 30 days to find 99 other like-minded allottees from their failed residential project or have their case thrown out of court without even a hearing for no fault of their own.

“So even those cases for final adjudication or those which have been reserved for pronouncement of order by NCLT would be affected by the ordinance. If this ordinance is upheld by the Supreme Court, litigation in NCLT will be almost reduced by 70-80%... Right now NCLT is the best forum,” Mr. Vajpai explained.

A Bench led by Justice Rohinton Nariman is scheduled to hear the case.

‘Class within a class’

The petition said the ordinance creates a “class within a class” and suffers from manifest arbitrariness.

Mr. Kumar said “his right to a home will be affected through Section 3 of the ordinance.”

He said the IBC was passed by Parliament to standardise the laws relating to insolvency and bankruptcy which were hitherto fragmented and unorganised. There, however, was doubts about the status of homebuyers, who were considered the most vulnerable lot in case a real estate project goes under.

Subsequently, Parliament passed the

Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act of 2018.

“This effectively said that homebuyers/allottees were also to be treated as “Financial Creditors” as under the Code,” the petition said. The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Act in 2019.

Now, Mr. Kumar said, the ordinance means to overthrow the 2018 Act and leave homebuyers helpless.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-hear-challenge-against-insolvency-ordinance/article30551876.ece
105,2020/01/12,Kaziranga records 96 species of wetland birds,"Kaziranga, home of the world's most one-horned rhinos, has 96 species of wetland birds — one of the highest for wildlife preserves in India.

Officials of the Kaziranga National Park and avian specialists conducted the second wetland bird count on January 9-10. The teams counted a total of 19,225 birds belonging to 96 species under 80 families.

The first waterfowl census in 2018 had yielded 10,412 birds covering 80 families from 21 families.

Kaziranga, about 220 km east of Guwahati, has a total area (tiger reserve) of 1,030 sq km with a core area of 430 sq. km.

""With 6,181 individuals, the bar-headed goose led the species count, followed by the common teal at 1,557 and northern pintail at 1,359. All three belong to the family anatidae,"" the park's Divisional Forest Officer Ramesh C. Gogoi told The Hindu on Sunday.

The other species with sizeable numbers include gadwall, common coot, lesser whistling duck, Indian spot-billed duck, little cormorant, ferruginous duck, tufted duck, Eurasian wigeon, Asian openbill, northern lapwing, ruddy shelduck and spot-billed pelican.

Mr. Gogoi said the survey covered four ranges of the park — Agoratoli, Bagori, Kohora and Burapahar.

More than half the birds (9,924) and 85 of the 96 species were recorded in Agoratoli Range. This was because Sohola, the largest of Kaziranga's 92 perennial wetlands, is in this range. “Not surprisingly, more than 34% of the birds counted were found in Sohola,"" he said.

The park also has more than 250 seasonal water bodies, besides the Dipholu River running through it.

No records

The first wetland bird survey in Kaziranga, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985, was conducted in 2018. Rabindra Sarma, the park's research officer said avian surveys could have been done in the 115-year-old Kaziranga earlier, but no records were maintained.

""Data on avian wealth is important because the wetlands nourish Kaziranga's ecosystem. Increase or decrease in the number of birds is indicative of the park's health,"" he said.

The survey, as in 2018, was done by dividing the bird roosting areas into blocks and ensuring that errors in counting were at a minimum, officials said.

The big four

Much of the focus of conservation efforts in Kaziranga are focused on the 'big four' species— rhino, elephant, Royal Bengal tiger and Asiatic water buffalo.

The 2018 census had yielded 2,413 rhinos and approximately 1,100 elephants. The tiger census of 2014 said Kaziranga had an estimated 103 tigers, the third highest population of the striped cat in India after Jim Corbett National Park (215) in Uttarakhand and Bandipur National Park (120) in Karnataka.

Kaziranga is also home to nine of the 14 species of primates found in the Indian subcontinent.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eks7g5/article30551853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12KAZIRANGA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kaziranga-records-96-species-of-wetland-birds/article30551854.ece
106,2020/01/12,Private property is a human right: Supreme Court,"A citizen’s right to own private property is a human right. The state cannot take possession of it without following due procedure and authority of law, the Supreme Court has held in a judgment.

The state cannot trespass into the private property of a citizen and then claim ownership of the land in the name of ‘adverse possession’, the court said.

Grabbing private land and then claiming it as its own makes the state an encroacher.

In a welfare state, right to property is a human right, a Bench of Justices Indu Malhotra and Ajay Rastogi declared in their January 8 verdict.

Adverse possession

“A welfare state cannot be permitted to take the plea of adverse possession, which allows a trespasser i.e. a person guilty of a tort, or even a crime, to gain legal title over such property for over 12 years. The State cannot be permitted to perfect its title over the land by invoking the doctrine of adverse possession to grab the property of its own citizens,” Justice Malhotra, who authored the judgment, laid down the law.

Yet, this is exactly what happened 52 years ago with Vidya Devi, a widow. The Himachal Pradesh government forcibly took over her four acres at Hamipur district to build a road in 1967.

Justice Malhotra highlights how the state took advantage of Ms. Devi’s illiteracy and failed to pay her a compensation for 52 years.

“The appellant [Ms. Devi] being an illiterate widow, coming from a rural background, was wholly unaware of her rights and entitlement in law, and did not file any proceedings for compensation of the land compulsorily taken over by the state,” Justice Malhotra empathised with Ms. Devi, who is 80 years old now.

Moves HC

Ms. Devi first learnt about her right for compensation in 2010 from her neighbours who had also lost their property to the road. Then, in her 70s, she did not lose time to march straight to the Himachal Pradesh High Court, accompanied by her daughter, to join her neighbours in their fight against the state. But the High Court asked her to file a civil suit in the lower court. Disappointed, Ms. Devi moved the Supreme Court.

Ordering the state to pay her ₹1 crore in compensation, the Supreme Court noted that in 1967, when the government forcibly took over Ms. Devi’s land, ‘right to private property was still a fundamental right’ under Article 31 of the Constitution.

Property ceased to be a fundamental right with the 44th Constitution Amendment in 1978. Nevertheless, Article 300A required the state to follow due procedure and authority of law to deprive a person of his or her private property, the Supreme Court reminded the government.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3zjtp/article30551818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/private-property-is-a-human-right-says-sc/article30551819.ece
107,2020/01/12,‘Shenanigans of Left-wing coterie’ worry academics,"Over 200 academics wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, blaming a “small coterie of Left-wing activists” for the deteriorating academic environment in the country.

“We observe, with dismay, that in the name of student politics, a disruptive far-left agenda is being pursued. The recent turn of events on campuses, from JNU to Jamia and from AMU to Jadavpur, alerts us to the deteriorating academic environment due to the shenanigans of a small coterie of left-wing activists,” they said.

The signatories include Hari Singh Gour University Vice-Chancellor R.P. Tiwari, Central University of South Bihar Vice-Chancellor H.C.S. Rathore and Sardar Patel University Vice-Chancellor Shirish Kulkarni, official sources said.

The statement is being seen as part of the government’s efforts to mobilise support in the academia after it faced criticism from a section of the intelligentsia over protests at some universities over a host of issues, including the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and the recent violence on the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University.

The statement said it had become difficult to organise public talks or speak independently owing to the “censorship imposed by the left-wing politics”. Strikes, dharnas and shut-downs over “maximalist demands” were common in Left strongholds, and personal targeting, public slandering and harassment for not conforming to the Left ideology were on the rise, the academics said.

The worst affected by this kind of politics were poor students and those from marginalised communities, the statement said. “They [these students] lose out on the opportunity to learn and build a better future for themselves. They also lose out on the freedom to articulate their own views and alternative politics. They find themselves constrained to conform to the majoritarian left politics. We appeal to all democratic forces to come together and stand for academic freedom, freedom of speech and plurality of thoughts,” it said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cg65vj/article30552440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SardarPatelUniversityVCjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shenanigans-of-left-wing-coterie-worry-academics/article30551777.ece
108,2020/01/12,Opposition meeting on Citizenship Amendment Act: Mamata Banerjee strategy goes against Congress plan,"Congress president Sonia Gandhi has convened a meeting of Opposition parties on Monday to decide on a joint strategy over the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC). With people’s protests against the new citizenship law and the NRC continuing for a month now, the Congress wants to rally Opposition parties to devise a common strategy.

The Congress Working Committee has already passed a resolution asking the government to withdraw the CAA and stop work on the National Population Register (NPR). Assemblies in Congress-ruled States are also likely to follow the Kerala Assembly in bringing resolutions to not implement the CAA.

But more than a common strategy and the parties in attendance, the list of absentees will reflect how united the Opposition is on the issue as pressure of regional elections could determine the outcome.

Jockeying for leadership

West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee has already announced that she would be giving the meeting a miss. And in a clear indication that the Trinamool chief, who had first hit the streets to protest against the CAA, is not willing to cede leadership space to the Congress, her party has decided not to send any representative.

With Bengal going to elections by April-May next year and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerging as her main challenge, Ms. Banerjee can ill afford to be seen as playing second fiddle to the Congress.

While the Trinamool chief has taken an aggressive stance against the CAA, the party’s leaders have been advised not to indulge in any personal attack on the BJP’s top leadership. Ms. Banerjee’s meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday drew her sharp criticism, but also raised eyebrows about her possible poll strategy.

Another Opposition leader who could stay away is Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal. Elections in Delhi are weeks away and the Congress is a key rival.

Though AAP has been protesting against the CAA, Mr. Kejriwal was conspicuous by his absence from protests at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) after the January 5 attack on the campus, allegedly by members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP), something the AVBP has categorically denied.

Mr. Kejriwal’s distance from the JNU protests have been viewed as an attempt to stay away from getting caught in the BJP’s narrative of projecting those supporting protesting JNU students as “urban Naxals”.

Interestingly, election strategist Prashant Kishor is advising both Mr. Kejriwal and Ms. Banerjee ahead of the Assembly elections.

Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati too has avoided such Congress-led meetings in the past, and relations have soured in the recent past with six BSP MLAs in Rajasthan joining the Congress.

“We cannot say who are going to come but invitations have been sent to senior Opposition leaders,” senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had said on Thursday at a press conference.

The meeting, however, will be attended by the Left parties, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, and the Nationalist Congress Party.

The Samajwadi Party, too, could attend, as it has been a part of the Congress delegation to meet President Ram Nath Kovind to protest police excesses against the students of Jamia Milia Islamia during the anti-CAA protests.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/afv8qm/article30503597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-MAMATA-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-meeting-on-citizenship-amendment-act-mamata-banerjee-strategy-goes-against-congress-plan/article30551664.ece
109,2020/01/12,India declares one-day mourning for Oman Sultan’s death,"A day of state mourning will be observed across India on Monday in memory of Sultan Qaboos who steered Oman’s India-friendly policy for five decades. The Ministry of Home Affairs notified that the tricolour would be flown at half mast as a mark of respect to the departed Sultan.

The monarch who passed away on Saturday was a special personality in the Gulf region which is critical for India from multiple points of view.

“In 1971, Oman stood out as an Arab country that supported India in the war with Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh. This led to some difficulties between Oman and Saudi Arabia but Sultan Qaboos maintained his friendly policy towards India,” said Prof. A.K. Pasha of the Centre for West Asian Studies of the JNU. During the war, Saudi Arabia sided with Pakistan and subsequently assisted it in post-war recovery.

As a result of this partnership, India and Oman formed a protective ring around Egypt when a part of the non-aligned countries wanted to isolate Cairo following the Camp David Accords of 1978 which was signed between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.

Also Read The Sultan who shielded Oman from regional turmoil

The far-sighted ruler, who took charge in 1970, was the most consistent partner from the Gulf for years before the United Arab Emirates (UAE) took a similar role in the Narendra Modi government. Sultan Qaboos had spent considerable time in India during his youth when he was tutored by Shankar Dayal Sharma, later President, during 1992-1997.

Prof. Pasha also points out that Oman played a moderating role regarding Kashmir and other Islam-related issues at the OIC. “Oman’s decision to allow India use the Salalah port for naval facilities was a major regional development that expanded India’s footprints in the region,” said Prof. Pasha.

The broader military collaboration between India and Oman was beneficial to the latter when the war in Yemen broke out, said veteran diplomat and former Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Anil Wadhwa. “India helped Oman build a fence on its border with Yemen,” said Mr. Wadhwa. As a result of the monarch’s leadership, India built an observation post at Ras Al Hadd of Oman.

Despite the warmth, the Sultan did not visit India to receive the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding for 2004 that was announced in 2007. It is not clear why though reports suggest that he was concerned about India’s growing friendship with other Gulf Arab states. However, the announcement of the MEA regarding the Nehru award conveyed the stature that Sultan Qaboos enjoyed in India.

“The Sultan has emerged as a leader who is much loved and admired not only by his own people but also by the entire region. He has helped Oman establish close relations with many countries including India,” said the MEA for the Nehru award. Mr. Wadhwa said the successor, Sultan Haitam bin Tariq Al Said, is expected to maintain the good neighbourly policy in the Gulf and the warm ties with India.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/sdkpbe/article30551723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-OMANSULTAN-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-declares-one-day-mourning-for-oman-sultans-death/article30551616.ece
110,2020/01/12,CPI(M) demands lifting of curbs in Jammu and Kashmir,"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Sunday demanded lifting of curbs in Jammu & Kashmir, asking the government to restore Internet services in keeping with the spirit of the Supreme Court judgment and revoking the detention of political leaders.

“Five months after the abrogation of Article 370 and the dismantling of the State of Jammu & Kashmir, the people of Kashmir continue to be deprived of various rights and liberties. Hundreds of leaders and activists are under detention, right to assemble denied and Internet shut down,” the party said, after a meeting of its Polit Bureau.

Anti-CAA protests

The Polit Bureau hailed the countrywide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). “The CAA undermines the secular concept of citizenship enshrined in the Constitution by introducing a religious criteria,” said the party’s statement, adding that the movement against CAA-NPR-NRC consisted of students, youth and ordinary citizens.

Terming it a brutal repression of peaceful protests, the party criticised the recent police action on Jamia Millia and Aligarh Muslim University campuses. It demanded that all “the false cases foisted on people” during the protests be withdrawn and the arrested persons be released.

While reiterating its demand for withdrawal of CAA, the CPI(M) asked the Centre to not to initiate the NPR process. It also appealed to all the Chief Ministers, who have spoken against the NRC, to put on hold the NPR process in their States.

JNU violence

The party said the JNU Vice-Chancellor, who was “responsible for destroying the character of the university” must be removed.

Holding the ABVP and the RSS activists responsible for the violence on January 5, it accused the Delhi Police of allowing goons to run riot and later facilitating their exit from the campus. “The Delhi police investigations are biased and mostly targeting the student activists belonging to the students union and not the actual culprits,” it said.

The Polit Bureau expressed concern over rising inflation rate and increase in the price of food items and essential commodities.

It also accused the Centre of being discriminatory towards Kerala’s fiscal requirements. “Kerala is entitled to ₹24,915 crore as public borrowing for the year 2019-20.

111,2020/01/12,BJP leader’s book comparing Shivaji to Modi angers MVA allies,"The release of a book comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj during an event at the Delhi headquarters of the BJP attracted the ire of the three ruling parties in Maharashtra on Sunday.

The book, titled Aaj ke Shivaji: Narendra Modi, was released during a religious-cultural meet organised by the Delhi BJP.

Criticising the author and BJP leader Jay Bhagwan Goyal, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said Mr. Goyal was in the Sena until a few years ago, but was thrown out after he attacked Maharashtra Sadan. “This man has compared Narendra Modi to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Is it acceptable to Maharashtra leaders of the BJP? Is it acceptable to the descendants of the king? Shouldn’t they speak up?” he asked.

The king’s descendants include former NCP MP Chhatrapati Udayanraje Bhosle, who joined the BJP but lost the Lok Sabha bypoll, and Chhatrapati Sambhaji Raje, a Rajya Sabha member from the BJP’s quota.

“At least the Maharashtra BJP should come clean and announce its position on this. Chhatrapati Shivaji cannot be compared to anyone in the world. There is one sun, one moon. There is only one Chhatrapti Shivaji Maharaj,” Mr. Raut said.

State Public Works Department minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan said the personality and work of Shivaji Maharaj are unmatchable. His party, too, condemned the book. “Comparing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to Narendra Modi is an insult to the ideology with which Maharaj worked, which is exactly opposite to that of the BJP,” Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said.

NCP leader and State Social Justice Minister Dhananjay Munde said the action had hurt the feelings of all Marathi-speaking people. “Maharashtra will not forgive those who attempt to compare themselves to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,” Mr. Munde said.

Meanwhile, Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe has filed a complaint against Mr. Goyal and the publisher at Nagpur’s Nandanvan police station, and sought a ban on the book.

Chhatrapati Sambhaj Raje said, “Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is our revered king. Comparing him to contemporary politicians is not acceptable to us Shiv Bhakts. The party that has published this book should not take our sentiments for granted. I demand the party president withdraw this book”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/akcyfc/article30551718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-MODI-SHIVAJI-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-leaders-book-comparing-shivaji-to-modi-angers-opposition-parties/article30551522.ece

113,2020/01/12,Former Jharkhand CM Babulal Marandi may merge party with BJP,"Former Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das has been asked by senior BJP leaders to come to Delhi this week as talks for a merger of the Jhakhand Vikas Morcha (P), led by another former Chief Minister of the State, Babulal Marandi, with the party gain pace.

Senior BJP sources in Delhi and Ranchi have said that Mr. Marandi has been in talks with the party for the merger, and Mr. Das has been asked to give his input. Mr. Marandi had been in the BJP in the past and broke away after he felt he was being undermined.

“The loss in the Jharkhand polls is being assessed by the BJP and it was felt, especially by the on-ground RSS in the State, that Mr. Marandi, a former BJP leader, should be wooed and brought back into the party to restore some of its support base among tribal communities, which has been badly eroded under Mr. Das,” a senior BJP leader said.

Multiple reasons

The BJP feels that if Mr. Marandi had note fielded strong candidates in seven or eight constituencies in the Santhal-Kolhan belts and cut into the grand alliance votes, the party’s tally in the Assembly election could have been lower. Mr. Marandi had broken his Lok Sabha election alliance with the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and the Congress to go it alone in these polls.

“Mr. Marandi too is assessing his political future, with Hemant Soren having pulled off a big victory. He feels he needs a national party to go forward, as his tally came down from eight (in 2014) to three in 2019,” the BJP leader said.

The sabotage that happened within the BJP campaign, specifically in Mr. Das’s Jamshedpur (East) loss to rebel Saryu Rai, is another reason Mr. Marandi is being brought back.

“There are certain leaders who worked against the interests of the party in these polls, and combined with Raghubar Das’s unpopularity, the grand alliance managed a simple majority in the Assembly. We have to acknowledge that too,” a source said.

With the “inauspicious” khar maas ending with Makar Sankranti on January 14, a meeting of the party parliamentary board will be called soon after to take forward the merger, BJP leaders say.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q2o7lj/article30551448.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THBABULALMARANDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/former-jharkhand-cm-babulal-marandi-may-merge-party-with-bjp/article30551449.ece
114,2020/01/12,"CAA, NRC will not be implemented in Bihar, says Prashant Kishor","National vice-president of Bihar ruling party Janata Dal (United) Prashant Kishor on Sunday thanked Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi for their “unequivocal rejection” of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens while offering an assurance that both CAA and NRC will not be implemented in Bihar.

However, when asked for his comment on the National Population Register (NPR) for which the Bihar government issued a notification on December 18, 2019, Mr. Kishor told The Hindu that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has to clarify on the issue as Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi has already declared that the process of NPR would be started from May 15, 2020.

“I join my voice with all to thank #Congress leadership for their formal and unequivocal rejection of #CAA_NRC. Both @rahulgandhi & @priyankagandhi deserve special thanks for their efforts on this count. Also would like to reassure to all - Bihar me CAA-NRC implement nahi hoga [CAA-NRC will not be implemented in Bihar]”, tweeted Mr. Kishor. His tweet came a day after Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi at the party’s working committee meeting on Saturday said “NPR 2020 is a disguised NRC” and termed the CAA as “discriminator and divisive whose sinister purpose is to divide the country along religious lines.”

Mr. Kishor said West Bengal, Kerala and other States too had started the process of NPR before the controversy erupted but later, when they had a relook, they stopped it.

In December 2019 when asked about the implementation of NRC in Bihar, Mr. Kumar had quipped, “kahe ka NRC? [NRC for what?]”.

In January this year, his deputy Modi said “the process of NPR will start in Bihar” and “no government has the courage to stop the NPR exercise in their respective States.” “The first phase of Indian census 2021 and the process of National Population Register (NPR) in Bihar will be done between the period of May 15 to June 28’ 2020”, said the Bihar government notification issued in December last year.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/69dzwl/article30551431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THCAAPROTESTSPATNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-nrc-will-not-be-implemented-in-bihar-says-prashant-kishor/article30551432.ece
115,2020/01/12,Citizenship Amendment Act: Narendra Modi’s remarks upset Ramakrishna Mission members,"The visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Belur Math, the headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission (RKM) founded in the late 19th century by Swami Vivekananda, and his comments on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) from RKM’s platform have created a controversy in West Bengal. A section of the mission members condemned the visit and many wrote to the RKM officials questioning why Mr. Modi was allowed to visit the Math. Political parties condemned Mr. Modi’s comments too, while RKM distanced itself from Mr. Modi’s remarks.

Mr. Modi reached Belur Math late on Saturday and paid tributes to Sri Ramakrishna, the mystic saint of 19th century Bengal, and “the room where Swami ji [Vivekananda] meditated.”

He himself tweeted the photos on Sunday. The problem, however, was over Mr. Modi’s extensive remarks on CAA indicating that the Act will not take away citizenship. The comments were considered as “political statement” by a section of the RKM officials and devotees.

A mission member, who was given deeksha (consecration) by late Swami Atmasthananda, who Mr. Modi claimed on Saturday was his teacher, said that it is “deeply hurtful to see controversial political messages being disseminated from the platform of RKM, which is an apolitical body.”

“Let me make two things clear. One, RKM has an elaborate and official process of consecration. Mr. Modi has not been officially consecrated and two, he is not allowed to come and make statements which are political in nature. My observation is, RKM has been deeply politicised over the last years, with induction and promotion of senior spiritual leaders who were associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh [RSS] earlier. Mr Modi’s visit is part of that growing trend of RKM,” said Gautam Roy, a Mission member.

Some of the senior monks of the RKM order who were scheduled to participate in a private devotees gathering on Sunday excused themselves, citing “preoccupations.” It was interpreted by the devotees as “the monks’ expression of displeasure.”

A section of disciples of the Mission sent a common letter to the RKM officials insisting that Mr. Modi’s visit to Belur Math be cancelled, a day before the 157th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda.

“As a student of Ramakrishna Mission, I am requesting the Belur Math authority to cancel Narendra Modi’s visit,” the letter said. Accusing Mr Modi of violence, it noted that the place of Ramakrishna, Sarada and Swami Vivekananda “should not invite a person who created problem[s] for people.” Many people also called up RKM to express their displeasure about the visit, sources in RKM said.

Swami Suvirananda, the general secretary of RKM, said, “The organisation will not comment on the Prime Minister’s speech on CAA. We are a strictly apolitical body. We have come here after leaving our homes to answer eternal calls. We do not respond to ephemeral calls.” He described RKM as an “inclusive” organisation.

“We are an inclusive organisation, which has monks from Hindu, Islam and Christian communities. We live like brothers of the same parents. To us, Narendra Modi is the leader of India and Mamata Banerjee the leader of West Bengal,” he added. Political parties too said that “using RKM as a political platform is condemnable.”

Protests continued unabated in Kolkata, albeit with a lesser intensity. Students, who tried to stage a protest outside Netaji Indoor Stadium when Mr. Modi was scheduled to speak, were taken into custody.

116,2020/01/12,"Social media posting is a fundamental right, rules Tripura High Court","In a landmark order, the High Court of Tripura ordered the police to refrain from prosecuting a man who was earlier arrested over a social media post. Chief Justice Akil Kureshi also barred the police from making any further arrest in connection with the case.

The Chief Justice passed the order on Friday after lawyers moved his court against the arrest and harassment of a Congress youth activist Arindam Bhattacharjee over his post on a social media platform. Mr. Bhattacharjee had in his Facebook page criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party’s online campaign in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and warned people to not dial a given phone number even by mistake.

“If you call 8866288662, all your data would go to hackers,” he had commented in his post, inviting the ire of BJP’s IT Cell, which responded with a police complaint.

Broadly remarks

The Chief Justice in his order broadly remarked that posting on social media was tantamount to a “fundamental right” applicable to all citizens, including government employees.

In compliance with the court’s order, the police have now erased Sections 120(B) and 153(A) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) from the relevant First Information Report (FIR) to quash the case.

Subal Bhowmik, senior Congress leader who unsuccessfully contested in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections from the West Tripura constituency, hailed the order. Mr. Bhowmik had organised protests outside West Agartala Police Station after Mr. Bhattacharjee was detained.

‘Adhere to rules’

“The order has been in line with the very essence of the Indian Constitution. We hope police officers will henceforth adhere to the rule book and not try to act as henchmen of their political bosses,” Mr. Bhowmik, himself a lawyer, told The Hindu on Sunday.

He alleged that the police had harassed many innocent people, particularly youths, and dragged them into false cases in recent months, over their posts on micro blogging sites.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/equmix/article29523806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMSOCIALMEDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/social-media-posting-is-a-fundamental-right-rules-tripura-high-court/article30551332.ece
117,2020/01/12,"CAA: There is nobody to have a dialogue with, says Anurag Kashyap","Filmmaker and writer Anurag Kashyap admits to being perpetually angry and “super frustrated” of late. More so the morning after Home Ministry’s notification of CAA coming into effect.“How do you fight a bully like this?” he asks rhetorically, as we sit down for an interview with one of Bollywood’s loudest dissenters against the government.

So latest is that yesterday Home Ministry issued a notification that CAA will come into effect from January 10, 2020…

I really don’t understand. For me, in any kind of a civil disobedience movement, people talk, they have a dialogue. Problem is there is nobody to have a dialogue [with]. You are shouting at a wall. The way the Prime Minister has been, is exactly replicated by the vice-chancellor in JNU. Not meeting people who have demands, not having a dialogue, totally cutting them away, pushing them off the edge. It’s also because they don’t know what to say and they can’t have a logical argument. They break your patience and you tip over. And when you tip over, they somehow feel they have the right to resort to violence. That has been the pattern in everything they have been doing.

Kal gazette aa gaya CAA ka. Inke rules formulate hue nahin hain. Kaise aa gaya? Dadagiri hai na (Yesterday the CAA was notified in the gazette though rules have not been formulated for it. How did this happen? This is bullying). You need to figure out, set down your rules. Just two days back they said they were doing that and now suddenly it’s out there. So why are you putting it out there? It’s just pushing you further, provoking you further and the bullying attitude of “we will just do it, so you get lost”.

They are literally borrowing from the book of the fascists and Nazis... How to “other” people. Are Delhi Police complicit? Are they pressurised? Things which are so obvious they are not paying attention to, and they are constantly changing the narrative. And the followers are buying it. People are deliberately twisting the truth. It’s like they all know what the truth is, but need to twist it because the hatred for the “other” is so much.

It’s almost like you are sitting in one of the Roman arenas and all the followers are the audience. There’s this bloodlust that all of them have and they are just enjoying it. It’s everybody’s big let out. It’s literally like chalo lado, maro (Let’s fight and kill).

Everyone is coming up with the same rati-ratayi (by-hearted) counter-argument. In your school groups, family groups, Twitter, Facebook; everywhere it is the same.

How do you see the road ahead?

I don’t know. They are beating up people and increasing their own security. What are you afraid of? They are such cowards. They will take the bulldozers over us. Or one will have to fight back till the point where it gets into a state where it’s re-election. It will become either extreme. I don’t think there is going to be any civility left. I am boiling with rage and it is so hard to control your rage. That’s how they are. It will go to that point. We are in for a long haul. Only thing we cannot do is become like them. We have to talk to each other to stay peaceful. People need to come out and start speaking the blunt truth.

I have stopped being respectful. I have lost total respect. So in my tweets, or whatever I say, there is zero respect. The decorum is gone. And it comes from within. I can’t help it. Sometimes one feels that one needs to call out things as it is.

Then there is the fear that the on-going resistance will die down..

They are hoping it will die down. Everybody has a limit, a threshold, work pressures. But the way it’s going on right now, those women at Shaheen Bagh... They are incredible. There are students coming out always, every day. It’s very bad time for the economy. None of those issues are being addressed… Even if they did good governance there wouldn’t be a problem. But where is the governance? You are constantly focusing on divide and rule, polarisation… They are doing literally what they are accusing others of doing: tukde tukde.

I might not buy into your ideology but so long as you are doing your job [it’s ok]. Someone is working for the country. You are not working for the country. You are working on your idea of the country, what you want it to become and you are forcing us to become that…

Again those electoral bonds have come out because Delhi elections are round the corner. Their whole focus is on the Delhi elections now. I see the whole strategy of budget also will be to impact Delhi elections.

How do you see the Delhi elections play out?

They know they are going to lose the elections so they are going to do everything to not lose the elections. Everything can entail anything. I don’t know to which level they will go to. Will they follow the Constitution or not follow the constitution? They think they are the Constitution. They are India. That’s the whole problem. They are like these ruthless, cruel oligarchs. Supreme Court kya bolta hai inko farak nahin padta (What the Supreme Court says doesn’t matter to them). They are openly bullying their way into every institution, be it judiciary, police, CBI, ED, everything.

There is no alternative emerging either…

What it’s heading towards, looking at what Uddhav Thackeray is doing or what Hemant Soren is doing… the whole politics will become regional. No one consolidated central thing. Delhi has become regional with AAP. All States will have their own regional parties and regional heads. If it goes that way with no central binding thing and if every government is a regional government then how do you not foresee a Europe like situation happening?

You have maintained that you have been protesting all through your life. How is this different?

When you raise your voice for your rights, there is always an avenue. There would always be someone who’d sit across and talk to you. Like the Censor Board during [the trouble over Deepa Mehta’s] Water. We travelled to Delhi, went to I&B ministry, there was Arun Jaitley, there was Seshadri Chari from the RSS who sat across. There was an argument, we read the whole script. There was always somebody to address your concerns. It wasn’t about coming out on the streets. In Udta Punjab case, we went to the court and it cleared us.

Right now it looks like there’s no system in place. Suddenly nobody is hearing you and that’s why more and more people are coming out. There is problem between the administration and the student’s union [in JNU]. The V-C is not hearing the student’s union. They get pushed to the point that they pull out the wires. How does it allow a party affiliate to come in and do what they did with the police standing outside? They won’t hear you till you get desperate and you cross one line, and that will give them an excuse to come in.

So does one carry on protesting?

Right now one has to keep on at it. I don’t know what happens in the Delhi elections. If they lose, will it affect them or will they become more stubborn?

But they may win Delhi. They won the general elections…

No, not unless there is manipulation; not unless there is force. I am talking about people who have voted for this government and I know many of them and I know they won’t [win the Delhi election]. They very clearly see that someone has done something for Delhi. Delhi may not have a political leader at the helm of things but it does have an administrator at the helm of it whose transition to a politician is something we have been waiting for, for years.

Also Read CWC demands withdrawal of CAA, stopping of NPR process

So you have that axe to grind with Arvind Kejriwal?

He is a good administrator. He will make something better. But I don’t see any kind of a collective emerging other than the students.

The way things are, wouldn’t it be better to have a good administrator in place than a politician?

It is great but to fight this [what’s happening in the country right now] you also need an equal. How do you fight a bully? The only way we have learnt our lives is the Gandhian way of protest and one is doing that. One has to start calling a spade a spade…

Congress is anyhow a spent force…

That’s privileged politics. Hum party kar rahe hain kya? Jab mann aata hai, aate hain, shakal dikha ke chale jaate hain (Are we partying [at the protests]? They come whenever they feel like, show their faces and go away).

So we go back then to your statement about the regional parties…

We are seeing regional voices emerging. In his one week tenure, what Hemant Soren has done. He has taken calls. The kind of statements Uddhav Thackeray is making, protecting the citizens. You are seeing a transition in Shiv Sena. My thing is how did he make that statement of not mixing religion with politics!

Isn’t there opportunism here somewhere?

The government has gone to such an extreme that I feel now these parties are talking to people at grassroot level. It’s not the time to make money, let’s do some good governance. It has brought the idealist in them. There is so much going on that they are all doing the right thing and also wearing the badge of doing the right thing. Whatever is the reason, even if opportunism.

Not a collective central party, I see regional parties defeating others in the game. Elections are still four-and-a-half years away. There are four-and-a- half years to do things.

How to have the protests remain more focused? Will it yield future leaders?

Some people are trying to give it structure, organise it. It has to stay a students’, citizens’ protest. Not affiliated to a political party. Some faces are emerging from it that will solidify over a period of time. Like Kanhaiya Kumar. People who don’t agree with his Left leaning tie-up are still listening to his argument. He has also become self aware. He is also speaking for the students. The constant narrative that is being created is Left trying to create the unrest. ABVP versus the Left. It’s about students. It has to stay away from the political parties. They need to come out on their own and fight their own battle. It has to stay a civil disobedience.

Coming to the Hindi film industry, you have often told me about how you are have been told to remain quiet. Bollywood has by and large been quiet. How come its speaking now?

Everyone has a conscience. Everybody’s threshold gets breached. People who are not speaking up also feel something. Some of them might be in fear, some of them might think it’s better to remain silent. They have gone through the experience. When the two Khans [Shah Rukh and Aamir] spoke, you saw the retaliation. They became like the privileged Muslim stars talking and their religion became the biggest counter argument rather than all their achievements. It was very poignant the way Deepika [Padukone] went and just stood there. That is a very strong, powerful statement. She didn’t go and say anything. In very clear terms, in two, three words she made known her stand.

Also Read An anatomy of anti-CAA protests

Are Bollywood guys who are speaking out organised in any manner? How did the Carter Road protest come about?

It came from the discussions between Zoya [Akhtar], Dia [Mirza] and Anubhav [Sinha]. I work in isolation, totally. I talk to people, I call them up to find out if there is a protest going on somewhere. We keep talking to one another. People do feel very strongly about it [in the industry]. Everybody has their sentiments, everybody has their feelings. But some are weighing them.

But there’s the other faction also in Bollywood…

These are people who are looking out for their businesses. They three, four, five of them who are literally seeking protection. They have a lot of other baggage that they need to handle. They don’t even have the courage or understanding to make an informed, intelligent opinion for it.

You have been one of the most vocal Bollywood people but it’s the women who have taken up the cudgels in a big way within the industry…

Across the world it’s the women calling them out. Right now the best of the politicians, people you look up to, PM of New Zealand, are all women. They have much more empathy and spine to stand up to all the bullying. Look at Shaheen Bagh. Women who have been playing their conventional roles even in societies which are very conservative. Once enough is enough and they decide to step out, men just back off. Women have always been like that.

Any chance of embracing politics yourself?

I know I have my politics and I genuinely believe in the Constitution. I have never questioned it simply because you start off your life as a kid reading it and you believe it as a way of life. I believe in my rights very strongly which is why I have always fought, whether it was Black Friday or Paanch or Water. I am not brave to do what I am doing. In a naive way I believe in the Constitution. Why should I not believe in it? I don’t know any other way to be.

But that doesn’t mean I should get into politics. It’s become this thing, people get into it to balance it, then they start losing themselves slowly. They realise that in order to do something, they have to win the election, to win the election they can’t stand for this and that, things that they feel for. Slowly they lose themselves to that thing for power. I’d be a very stupid politician. Not just fail, I will become a joke within five years.

118,2020/01/12,Akali Dal reduced to personal fiefdom of the ‘Badals’: Punjab Ministers,"Ministers of the ruling Congress government in Punjab on Sunday said the Shiromani Akali Dal had been reduced as the personal fiefdom of the ‘Badals’, a day after party suspended rebel Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his son former Finance Minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa.

Cabinet Ministers including Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Gurpreet Singh Kangar in a statement here said the SAD was in a complete disarray, particularly in the post Prakash Singh Badal era, pointing to the rebellion by the Dhindsas.

Both the Dhindsas were suspended from SAD on Saturday after the core committee meeting.

“The Dhindsas had openly revolted against the stifling control of SAD by the ‘Badals’, declaring their intent to liberate the party from the family and revive its lost glory,” the Ministers pointed out, citing it as just the latest example of the mounting disillusionment within the party against Sukhbir Singh Badal’s leadership and the lack of democracy in it. “If senior leaders of the party are so unhappy with the leadership and loss of ideology, one can only imagine how dissatisfied the ordinary workers would be,” they said.

“The Akali Dal has lost all credibility under the unprincipled and unethical leadership of the Badals, who have lost political integrity and have cut off the party from the grassroots to promote their selfish interests.”

The Ministers said it was time for them to step down and hand over the party reins to those who remain committed to the Akali ideology. “Else, the day will soon come when the Akalis would be wiped out from the face of Punjab [and Indian] polity,” they said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m8h4wh/article30306080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUKHBIR-SINGH-BADAL-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/akali-dal-reduced-to-personal-fiefdom-of-the-badals-punjab-ministers/article30550615.ece
119,2020/01/12,"India’s under-5 mortality of girls exceeds that of boys, unlike global trend, says report","India is among the few countries in the world where, in 2018, the mortality under-5 years of girls, exceeded that of boys, according to the ‘Levels and Trends in Child Mortality’ report by the United Nations (UN) inter-agency group for child mortality.

The global report states that in 2018 fewer countries showed gender disparities in child mortality, and across the world, on average, boys are expected to have a higher probability of dying before reaching age-5 than girls. But this trend was not reflected in India.

Risk higher

“In some countries, the risk of dying before age 5 for girls is significantly higher than what would be expected based on global patterns. These countries are primarily located in Southern Asia and Western Asia,” said the report.

According to India’s 2017 Sample Registration System (SRS) the States with the highest burden of neonatal mortality are Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, with 32, 33 and 30 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births, respectively. India’s neonatal mortality rate is 23 per 1,000 live births.

Also States and Union Territories, Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttarakhand showed the largest gender gaps in under-5 mortality.

“The burden of child mortality is determined both by the mortality rate (the proportion of children who die) and by the estimated population of any given State (total number of annual births). In this sense, Uttar Pradesh is the State with the highest number of estimated newborn deaths in India, both because of the high neonatal mortality rate and because of the large cohort of births that occur every year in the State,” noted information released by UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund).

Five countries

According to the report, half of all under-5 deaths in 2018 occurred in five countries: India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia. India and Nigeria alone account for about a third.

Estimates indicate that the majority of child mortality cases in India are attributable to deaths during the neonatal period. The major causes of neonatal mortality are pre-term birth, intrapartum related events, and neonatal infection. In the post-neonatal period, the major direct causes of death are diarrhoea and pneumonia.

The report adds that despite the tremendous progress in child survival that has been made over the past two decades, one child or young adolescent died every five seconds in 2018.

“Globally, 85% of deaths among children and young adolescents in 2018 occurred in the first five years of life, accounting for 5.3 million deaths, of which 2.5 million (47%) occurred in the first month of life, 1.5 million (29%) at age 1-11 months, and 1.3 million (25%) at age 1-4 years. An additional 0.9 million deaths occurred among children aged 5-14 years,” noted the report.

Urgent need

The report adds that it is urgently required to further accelerate progress in preventing child deaths.

“Current trends predict that close to 10 million 5- to 14-year-olds, and 52 million children under 5 years of age, will die between 2019 and 2030. Almost half of these under-5 deaths will be newborns whose deaths can be prevented by reaching high coverage of quality antenatal care, skilled care at birth, postnatal care for mother and baby, and care of small and sick newborns,” said the study.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ma55k7/article30550393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UNLOGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-under-5-mortality-of-girls-exceeds-that-of-boys-unlike-global-trend-says-report/article30550394.ece
120,2020/01/12,India to acquire 200 fighter jets for Air Force: Defence Secretary,"The government is in the process of acquiring around 200 aircraft to cope with the depleting aerial inventories of the Indian Air Force, Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said here on Sunday.

The contract for HAL-manufactured 83 LCA Tejas Mark 1 A advanced fighter jets are in the final stages, he said.

Apart from these, Expression of Interest (EOI) has been floated for another 110 aircraft, based on which Request for Proposal (RFP) will be floated, Mr. Kumar said.

“Roughly (for) 200 aircrafts, the acquisition is in process,” he said.

“We are in the process of finalising the contract for 83 Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Mark 1 A, which are advanced fighters to meet the urgent needs of India,” the defence secretary told reporters on the sidelines of commissioning Indian Coast Guard vessels here.

Mr. Kumar said that the contract for the LCAs will be signed “definitely this year“.

“We want to do it as soon as possible,” the Defence Secretary said when asked whether a time frame has been finalised by which the new aircraft are to be acquired.

Mr. Kumar said that with the design having been finalised, state-run aerospace behemoth Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) will be ramping up production of the LCA Mark 1 A jets from 8 to 16 per year.

“If required, through outsourcing, we can further enhance it,” he said.

The Air Force has Sukhoi 30 MKIs, Mirage 2000s, Mig 29s and the ageing Jaguars and Mig 21 Bisons in its inventory of fighter jets at present.

121,2020/01/12,"Quit BJP and form an alternative anti-CAA government, Congress tells Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal","The Congress in Assam has offered to help Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal form an alternative “anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)” government, if he quits the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

The All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) led by perfume baron Maulana Badruddin Ajmal has shown interest in being a part of such an alternative arrangement.

Leaders of the All Assam Students’ Union and other organisations behind the ongoing protests against the CAA had almost a fortnight ago floated the idea of forming a “political alternative” to the BJP, its ally the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), and the Congress. The idea was to have a party that concentrated on the rights and aspirations of Assam’s indigenous communities.

‘BJP stranglehold’

The Congress, almost immediately, offered to back such an alternative party. But on Saturday, Opposition leader in the Assam Assembly, Debabrata Saikia, asked Mr. Sonowal to “come out of the BJP stranglehold” with 30 MLAs.

“The Chief Minister has been fighting against his conscience while obeying his BJP masters. He should leave the party with 30 MLAs in view of the anger of the people in Assam against the CAA. We will support him in forming an anti-BJP government so that he can continue as the Chief Minister,” Mr. Saikia said.

“We are ready to back any government that is anti-CAA and anti-BJP,” said Mr. Ajmal, the chief of AIUDF and the party’s lone Lok Sabha member.

The BJP has 61 legislators in the 126-member Assam Assembly. Its regional allies are the AGP (14 legislators) and the Bodoland People’s Front (12 legislators). The Congress has 25 and the AIUDF 13 lawmakers. The House has a lone independent member.

Protests continue

Protests, initially violent, leading to the death of six people in police firing and arson, erupted mainly in central and eastern Assam after the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha on December 11. The voices against the CAA have grown louder since the Union Home Ministry issued a gazette notification saying the law will come into force from January 10.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/t67bt3/article30397695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-THGRP-SAIKIA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/quit-bjp-and-form-an-alternative-anti-caa-government-congress-tells-assam-chief-minister-sarbananda-sonowal/article30550180.ece
122,2020/01/12,News Analysis: New Army chief can tell country from government,"New Army Chief General Manoj Naravane has sent out a clear and direct message to the country and his rank and file that the Army or the armed forces must at all times uphold the Constitution and its Preamble, which contain the core values of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity.

The General’s comments, contained in his opening remarks at the Army Chief’s annual press conference, and not in response to questions, makes it clear that the oath a jawan or an officer takes is to the Constitution (and not to the government of the day).

Giving out a “few points” about what the Army was about and sending a message to his men and women, Gen. Naravane said ‘A’ was for allegiance that meant for him: “As the Army, or the armed forces, we swear allegiance to the Constitution of India. In fact, be it a jawan or an officer, we take an oath...that is what should guide us in all our actions and at all times.”

“But what does this really translate into? What this translates into is also the core values which are enshrined into the Preamble to the Constitution — that is justice, liberty, equality and fraternity and that is what we are fighting for when we are deployed on the borders, safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity; it is to secure for our people these core values. We need to keep this in mind at all times,” he added.

The General’s remarks assume significance at a time when tens of thousands of people, including young students, have taken to reading the Preamble in public while protesting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Gen. Naravane also makes the point that when deployed at the borders, the forces are fighting for the core values contained in the Preamble, which has received much public attention since the CAA was passed in December.

The Army chief’s formulations on Saturday come days after the December 26 comments made by his predecessor and now Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Bipin Rawat that leaders were those who led the country in the “right direction”.

Gen. Rawat, widely seen as critical of the anti-CAA agitation, had said: “Leaders are not those who lead people in inappropriate directions as we are witnessing in a large number of universities and college students the way they are leading masses of crowds to carry out arson and violence in our cities and towns.”

The former Army Chief’s comments had come under considerable fire from the Opposition leaders and given his appointment as the first-ever CDS found favour with the government of the day.

A point of interest is that Gen. Naravane’s emphasis on justice, liberty, equality and fraternity come a day after the Supreme Court said the “geopolitical struggle” in Jammu & Kashmir “cannot be played down or ignored” while addressing the issue of Internet shutdown and the freedom of expression.

“In line with the aforesaid requirement, we may note that even the broadest guarantee of free speech would not protect the entire gamut of free speech. The question which begs to be answered is whether there exists a clear and present danger in restricting such expression,” Justices N.V. Ramana, R. Subhash Reddy and B.R. Gavai said in their judgment on government curbs in Kashmir.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ei72s2/article30550029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NARAVANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/news-analysis-new-army-chief-has-drawn-a-clear-distinction-between-constitution-and-govt-of-the-day/article30550030.ece
123,2020/01/12,"Delhi Assembly elections 2020: AAP, Cong’s first list of candidates likely before Jan. 14, BJP’s by Jan. 18","The Delhi Assembly election is just a few weeks away and the main contenders — the AAP, BJP and Congress — are busy vetting their prospective candidates and expected to start naming their nominees later this week.

The ruling party is likely to come up with its first list of candidates before January 14 and the saffron party by January 18. The Congress’ first list of nominees too is expected before January 14.

The incumbent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which tasted stupendous success winning 67 of the 70 Assembly seats in 2015, is likely to repeat most of the candidates who contested last time.

Sources, however, said some of AAP’s 2019 Lok Sabha candidates, including party spokespersons Atishi and Raghav Chadha, might be given tickets in the upcoming polls. “The AAP will use a 3C yardstick of (no)corruption, (no)criminal record and (good)character as benchmarks for choosing candidates for the upcoming polls,” senior party leader Sanjay Singh said.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is likely to fight from the New Delhi Assembly seat again, sources said while refuting reports that the AAP national convenor would contest from two seats in the upcoming polls.

According to a senior AAP leader, the party is likely to come up with its first list of candidates before January 14.

The BJP, meanwhile, is shortlisting names of probable candidates.

The party’s election committee in its meeting on Saturday shortlisted around 1,400 names as probables, a senior party leader said, adding, “The panel met again on Sunday and brought down the names of probables to 3-4 on each seat.”

“There are 50 prominent BJP workers in every assembly constituency. That means, in 70 assembly constituencies we have almost 3,500 workers who have suggested the name of their favourite candidate. Candidates will be selected after considering all those names,” BJP’s Delhi assembly election in-charge Prakash Javadekar had said in a statement.

The final list of probables prepared by the election committee will be submitted to the BJP leadership and The first list is expected to be announced around January 18, a senior BJP leader said.

Delhi Congress Chief Subhash Chopra said his party’s process for vetting candidates is underway.

“The meetings of party’s screening committee and election committee have been held. First list of candidates is expected to be out before the nominations begin on January 14,” said Mr. Chopra.

Delhi Assembly polls will be held on February 8 and the counting of votes will take place on February 11.

Ms. Thakur, MLA from Teosa and Women and Child Development Minister in the Uddhav Thackeray government, was speaking at a function in Amravati, over 690 kilometres from Mumbai, on January 11.

“Our culture says if you touch a cow, all negativity will go away,” she told the gathering.

125,2020/01/12,None can stop rollout of Citizenship Amendment Act: Amit Shah,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said no matter how much the Congress opposed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the BJP government at the Centre would rest only after granting citizenship to members of six minority religions from the three neighbouring countries, and no one could stop it.

“They are the sons and daughters of the country too. Even they enjoy the same right over the country as you and I,” he claimed at a public rally in Jabalpur.

Attacking the Congress, Mr. Shah said if it didn’t retract from its stand, “whatever is left of it will also be wiped out. They need to understand the pulse of the nation, know what people want. Instead, they fear their vote bank.”

The Minister said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, New Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee were misleading people over the law and had even instigated riots. “We launched an awareness campaign to contain the misinformation being spread,” he added.

Several leaders during the partition, including Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, claimed Mr. Shah, had offered to embrace the minorities from Pakistan and Bangladesh, whenever they wished to cross over to escape “human rights violations and atrocities there. Yet Rahul Gandhi pays them no heed.”, he said.

Nankana Sahib attack

“I want to ask the human rights champions,” he said, “when atrocities were being committed in Pakistan against minorities, didn’t they see their human rights? Don’t these people have those rights too? The attack on Nankana Sahib has brought the atrocities in front of the world.”

Mr. Shah dared Mr. Gandhi and Ms. Banerjee to show provisions in the Act that would take away the citizenship of minorities, including Muslims. “Instead, the law is about granting citizenship. When the Congress divided the country on religious lines, our leaders told minorities they were welcome in India, and would be given citizenship and respect,” he said.

Pointing to the purported drop in minority numbers in Pakistan and Bangladesh over decades, Mr. Shah said, “I want to ask the deaf and blind leaders of the Congress to tell us where were all these people lost. They were converted, killed and women suffered atrocities.”

And they came to India leaving everything behind, he said. “Yet they didn’t abandon their religion, wanting to practice the one they were born into. To save their religion and respect, to escape the human rights violations there, they came here,” Mr. Shah claimed.

Exhorting party workers to go door-to-door to spread a positive message and seek support on the CAA, and even the Ram temple in Ayodhya, the surgical strikes in Pakistan and the dilution of Article 370 of the Constitution, he said the party planned to conduct 500 meetings, 250 press conferences and reach out to three crore families across Madhya Pradesh.

Alleging that the Congress spoke the language of Pakistan, Mr. Shah said: “They both oppose the CAA, ask for evidence after surgical strikes and said Kashmiris were facing injustice as Article 370 was diluted. All this for vote bank politics.”

“Some boys of the Jawaharlal Nehru University raised anti-national slogans, saying the country should be divided into a thousand parts. Shouldn’t they be put in jail,” he asked.

As per the gazette notification issued by the Centre on January 10, the CAA, under which non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, will be given Indian citizenship, came into force from January 10.

Over 1,100 cases have been received before the one-year-old Lokpal and the members sat, discussed and found that the most of the cases were not coming under its jurisdiction or act and disposed of, Mr. Ghose told reporters in Coimbatore.

However, the people who had filed the cases were told to process their cases in the particular committee or institutions to get their allegations resolved for their own benefit, he said.

“Any other allegation and grievances, we will arrange to take up and there is no difficulty to carry on with full swing,” he said.

Stating that the Lokpal would function from a new office from January-end or the first week of February, Mr. Ghose said, “We are in a position to start our work.”

To a question whether Lokpal can take up suo moto cases such as the one in which a Congress MLA from Puducherry charged his own party-ruled government with corruption, Mr. Ghose said the matter has not been formulated yet and as and when the matter comes they would decide.

He said that an awareness should be created on Lokpal by the people, particularly the media.

127,2020/01/12,JNU attack state-sponsored: Congress panel,"The January 5 attack against students and faculty members of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) was “state-sponsored”, a Congress fact-finding committee said on Sunday.

It accused Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar of being the “mastermind” of the attacks, demanding his immediate dismissal and a criminal investigation against him, faculty members who conspired with the attackers and the company charged with security on the campus.

“This attack was state-sponsored. There is absolutely no doubt about it... The question is what did the administration and the Delhi police do to stop it,” Mahila Congress chief Sushmita Dev, a member of the four-member committee, said at the release of the report. She said there was sufficient evidence to prove that the perpetrators were from right-wing factions.

“I have no doubt that what happened on January 5...is pre-planned, pre-mediated and a criminal conspiracy,” said Ms. Dev. She pointed to the disconnection of electricity, as well as the role of the police during the attack and the aftermath, including the failure to file attempt to murder charges against the perpetrators, despite the head injuries to victims.

Noting that there was “overwhelming prima facie evidence that [police officers] facilitated the criminal elements on the campus”, the report said their negligence and complicity brought the Home Ministry under suspicion, too. “The remarks by the Home Minister on the CAA-NRC agitations and punishing of ‘Tukde Tukde Gang’ had also emboldened the perpetrators of violence on the JNU campus,” said the report.

Mr. Naqvi, who was here to inaugurate the Hunar Haat, said the CAA was envisaged to give citizenship to minorities of the three neighbouring countries, and not for taking away the citizenship of any community within the country. “Some people are trying to mislead a major section of the population in their attempts to create disturbances,” he said.

These “horror show mongers” were claiming that citizenship of a major section was under threat. “These gangsters are trying to create confusion in the minds of people with their hollow claims. People should understand the conspiracies that are being planned against the government,” he said.

But the present law will be applicable there too following the abrogation of Article 370,” he maintained.

The restrictions were imposed on August 5 last when India abrogated the Article 370 that gave special powers to Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated the State into two Union Territories.

In the first such trip by foreign diplomats post August 5, envoys of 15 countries, including the U.S., last week visited Jammu and Kashmir where they interacted with select political representatives, civil society members as well as top military brass with the Indian government, rejecting criticism that it was a guided tour.

However, these airlines will have to allow a security audit by Indian agencies, and ensure that Indian employees are tasked with sensitive operations.

Following the changes, U.S. airlines will have access control to the aircraft, can screen unaccompanied baggage, conduct secondary check of passengers at the ladder point and have security control of cargo.

Until now, foreign carriers had to enter into an agreement with an Indian airline for performing these activities.

The Union Cabinet in its meeting on December 24, 2019, gave an in-principle approval for allowing international airlines from three countries — U.S., Canada and Australia — to carry out their own ground handling. This reversed a decision taken by the Cabinet in 2006 barring all foreign carriers from such operations, a senior government official said. The Cabinet also approved a draft standard operating procedure (SOP) detailing security measures to be adopted for such operations.

As a result, the Ministry of Civil Aviation (Ground Handling Services) Regulations, 2018, can now be amended so that they are on par with provisions of air services agreements India had entered into with the above three countries.

The reason U.S., Canada and Australia are singled out is that the bilateral agreements with them were the only time India allowed international carriers to conduct their ground handling services on their own or to self-handle. However, the changes will be effected only for the U.S. as of now, it is reliably learnt. The Hindu had reported as early as September 19, 2019, that India would be amending its rules to placate the U.S.

India was forced to bend over backwards to appease the U.S. after the latter objected to the discrepancy between the ground handling rules and the Air Services Agreement of 2005, asserting that the former denied its airlines their bilateral right. Following several warnings, the U.S. banned Air India from self handling in an order on July 30, 2019, in a retaliatory move.

“There were also warnings that Air India may be asked to submit details about its flight schedule afresh, causing inconvenience to the airline, which is the only Indian carrier operating between the two countries following the collapse of Jet Airways,” the official explained.

The amendments to the ground handling regulations will incorporate exceptions to the clauses 2 and 3 of Section 3. Clause 2 allows airlines to perform passenger and baggage handling, but bars them from security functions performed beyond the check-in area at airports. Clause 3 imposes similar restrictions on international cargo airlines.

When U.S. carriers self-handle in India, a standard operating procedure will have to be followed requiring airline security staff and baggage screeners to be Indian citizens and on the direct payrolls of the airline, who will be subjected to a thorough background check by aviation security watchdog, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS). These airlines will also have to be open to ""security audit, inspection and test"" as and when required and data pertaining to movement of cargo will have to be made available through real time feed of CCTV coverage. BCAS can also ask airlines for validating facilities at all points of departure and the Aviation Security Group (comprising different security agencies such as CISF, BCAS, among others) will be deployed at airside during cargo operations. The BCAS will also have the permission to intervene if the central security agency feels the need for it.

The changes will be effected only for the US, though the Union Cabinet has provided a blanket permission for all the three countries, according to the official.

While neither Air India self handles in the US, nor do American carriers in India, the denial of reciprocal rights by India as laid down under the air services agreement was viewed by the U.S. as a downgrade in the relationship.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k9irpb/article30546157.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMERICANAIRLINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-amends-rules-for-us-airlines/article30546158.ece

More than 500 bulls from several villages of Kuppam Assembly constituency were brought to the venue, seemingly lured by lucrative prize money ranging from ₹10,000 to ₹1 lakh.

An hour after commencement of the race, an intoxicated bull was on the track in full rage.

When the speeding bull made a sudden motion of its body, one of the ropes attached to had swung into air and got entwined with the neck of a man identified as Abdul Basha (27) of Chinna Baldur village nearby. The impact was such that the animal dragged the youth along with it for several metres, when he finally fell down lifeless with the rear of neck lacerated. The commotion which left a stampede along the track led to 20 others injured, though with minor injuries.

Immediately, the event organisers had reportedly arranged the shifting of the body to a distance and resumed the bull race. After a couple of hours, the police, who came to know about the casualty, rushed to the spot and stopped the race.

Circle Inspector (Kuppam Rural) Krishna Mohan told The Hindu that a case had been registered, and that the bull race was stopped midway.

145,2020/01/12,"Be cautious while going out on vacation, police urge people","The city police urged people to be cautious and take additional protection measures while going out of city during Sankranti holidays.

During the year 2019, the city has witnessed 199 house break-in (HB) cases, including 135 during night. Though the number of cases decreased compared to previous year, the police said cooperation from citizens would further bring down the number of cases.

According to police officials, there are about 120 CCTV cameras which allocated to the Locked House Monitoring System (LHMS), but many of them are not used due to lack of requests from public.

Explaining about the measures to be taken, Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP- Crimes) Ch. Penta Rao said that people going on vacation can inform the local police station about their absence. He said that the beat constables will keep a regular watch or would fix LHMS cameras if requested. He also said that it is also a good idea to inform about their absence to neighbours and friends asking them to keep a watch over their house. The ACP also added that if there is huge amount of cash, ornaments or valuables, it is better to keep them in bank lockers.

Police said that HBs can occur not just in individual houses or houses situated on the city outskirts, but also in apartments. Very recently, a flat situated in second floor of an apartment building in Seethammadhara was also burgled.

“Burglars are trained in such a way that they could break a lock of house without any noise. Most of them are using dupSlicate keys to open the locks. It is a misconception that HBs cannot occur in apartments,” said Mr. Penta Rao.

Police said that residents must ensure that security in the colonies or apartments are tight. They point out that many HBs occur due to lack of negligent watchmen/security and lack of proper vigilance.

“Watchmen/security guards must make sure that they do not allow strangers who claim to be mechanics, messengers, salespersons into colonies or apartments, especially when houses are locked,” said an Inspector working with the crime wing. He also said that residents must conduct a surprise check on the security guards during the early hours to check their alertness. Mr. Penta Rao said that people can seek the help of police to check the antecedents of their maids or security guards before appointing them.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/be-cautious-while-going-out-on-vacation-police-urge-people/article30548210.ece

In order to cater to the additional festival rush, the APSRTC has been operating special buses from January 9. The corporation’s Executive Director (Operations) K.S. Brahmananda Reddy said the additional buses would ply from Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru to different locations in the State.

While the officials claim that compared to last year, the number of special buses pressed into service this year is higher, people are asking for more buses.

From Hyderabad alone, 4,200 special buses are being operated to various districts in Andhra Pradesh. From key areas of Hyderabad, 67 buses ply to Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts, 95 to Visakhapatnam, 450 to East Godavari, 480 to West Godavari, 710 buses to Vijayawada, 600 to Guntur, 540 to Ongole, 300 to Nellore, 100 to Tirupati, 180 to Anantapur, 400 to Kurnool and 280 to Kadapa.

Pvt. operators warned

The corporation has also deployed its officers at key boarding points in Hyderabad to ensure that Andhra-bound passengers boarding the bus there do not face any problem.

The Transport Department, meanwhile, has warned private bus operators against fleecing people by charging exorbitant bus fares. The department staff has been conducting surprise checks at the check posts and toll plazas and booking cases against law-violators. Many buses have also been seized.

Railway app

The South Central Railways, meanwhile, will run 207 special trains, including AC special and Suvidha (special fare) passing through Vijayawada, and 61 special trains originating from the division apart from Sabarimala specials to clear the festival rush.

In order to avoid long queues at booking offices during peak hours and to book unreserved tickets from their smart phones, the rail authorities have designed the ‘UTS on Mobile’ app which can be availed by the passengers.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rozix3/article30546450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12VJRTCRUSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pnbs-rly-station-choke-with-festival-crowds/article30546451.ece
149,2020/01/12,"Despite ban, stage being set for cockfighting in Andhra Pradesh","Thousands of roosters, sharp knives, crores of money and huge arenas are being readied for organising rooster fights during the three-day Sankranti festivities in coastal areas of the State, particularly Krishna, Guntur, East and West Godavari districts.

Despite a ban on cockfights, organisers and punters are making elaborate arrangements for conducting the fights in huge arenas (known as kodi pandela barulu in local parlance) in the villages.

Rooster fights will be conducted day and night under floodlights in many villages on Bhogi, Makara Sankranthi and Kanuma festivals, and the lush green fields will soak in blood. Thousands of birds will be killed in the bloodsport.

Newly wed couples, who will be invited as special guests for the harvest festival, a major festival for farmers in Andhra Pradesh, enjoy the bloodsport. Once the fierce battle ends, severed wings, legs, heads and sometimes wounded fowls struggling for life can be seen on the green grass.

Making a beeline

Thousands of people, irrespective of age, visit Andhra Pradesh, known for cockfights during the harvest festival. Animal and bird lovers have been condemning the inhuman practice of killing fowls for fun in the guise of culture and have been demanding that the government implement the ban on the bloodsport as per the directions of the High Court.

Film personalities, businessmen, public representatives, realtors, software professionals, women, farmers and students from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Telangana, Maharashtra and other States visit Andhra Pradesh to participate in the event.

NRIs from the U.S., Australia, Canada, European and Gulf countries plan a trip to Andhra Pradesh to celebrate Sankranti in their native villages and witness rooster fights. Crores of rupees change hands at the arenas and people bet huge amounts on each game.

Cases booked

The police booked about 1,000 cases on cockfight organisers and punters in the last 15 days in the State, and intensified patrolling to prevent the banned game.

""We identified that cockfights were conducted in 4,552 villages, including 2,494 villages in West Godavari, 1,010 places in Krishna, 400 arenas in Guntur, 466 in East Godavari and other places in the State in 2018. Police have booked 3,228 cases, arrested 7,123 persons and seized 6,865 knives used for cockfights,"" a police officer said.

The organisers train the fowls named as ‘Sethu’, ‘Nemali’, ‘Dega’, ‘Kaki,’ and ‘Hamsa,’. Villagers will train special species of roosters for the fights and provide them special diet. Each bird is sold for anything between ₹10,000 and ₹1 lakh depending upon the height and colour of the rooster.

Preparing the fowl

""We will give bath to the fowls with hot water, put them through an exercise regimen, feed them almond, meat and other nutritious diet and conduct several trial fights before selling them. The price of the fowl depends on the date of birth, age and the number of fights it won earlier,"" said a farm owner P. Satyanarayana of Undi in West Godavari district.

A man from Rollagunta village has brought a special variety of fowls titled ‘speed fighters’ from Peru, which are in demand. Each foreign bird was being sold at ₹1 lakh and above, a punter B. Ramu of Dwaraka Tirumala said.

""Cockfights will be conducted in mango and banana orchards too. The venue will be decked up for the game and the organisers auction space for gambling, gundata, ‘mudu mukkalata’, liquor shops, fast food centres and pan shops to add extra fun to the visitors,"" said an organiser M. Keshavulu of Tarigoppula village in Krishna district.

""Cockfights are part of Sankranti festival and the culture of Konaseema. It’s a prestige question for the bridegrooms who will bet huge amounts on rooster fights,"" said a woman Pilli Adi Lakshmi of Ravulapalem in East Godavari district.

Meat as trophy

The meat of the roosters killed in the fights is called as ‘Koja’, which costs more than ₹1,500 per kg. There will be a great demand for ‘Koja’, a farmer A. Subba Rao of Korukallu in Krishna district said.

NRIs and visitors from different States are said to have reserved rooms in hotels in Bhimavaram, Razole, Amalapuram, Gudivada, Narsapuram, Guntur, P. Gannavaram, Kakinada, Rajamahendravaram and other towns in advance.

Vijayawada Police Commissioner Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao said that cockfights were banned and warned that stern action would be taken against organisers and punters.

Krishna Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu said the police were conducting kabaddi, volley ball and other sports under all police stations limits in the district to wean away youth from the banned game.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gmy339/article30546421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/208920175col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fowl-play/article30546425.ece
150,2020/01/12,Hillocks and jungles: Preferred spot for cockfight organisers,"The arrival of Sankranti season heralds a wave of excitement among the lovers of cockfights, who dominate the rural side, clandestinely operating the prohibited game in forest locations and fields abutting hillocks and jungles, to escape police raids.

This game, sporadic in the middle of a year, takes the centrestage with the advent of winter, and goes on till Maha Sivaratri, touching its peak during Sankranti.

Rooster fights find big patronage in Chittoor district, not only from local people, but also from border villages in Tamil Nadu, and neighbouring Kadapa district. A number of forested villages nestled in Bhakarapeta to Yerravaripalem areas in Seshachalam biosphere hold substantial history of cockfights since decades. On the eastern side, cockfights dominate the rural side in Satyavedu, Nagalapuram, Varadaiahpalem, B.N. Kandriga and some other mandals bordering Tamil Nadu. The western side of Kuppam and Palamaner is also vulnerable to the bloodsport.

With the start of harvesting of several prime crops along the inter-State zone, hundreds of farmers and farm workers and petty traders show keen interest in cockfights. Compared to a decade ago, the game organisers are now a sophisticated lot, using social media groups and mobile phones to spread the information and lure potential punters as well. From a few thousand rupees in the 1980s, now the stakes in the game have run into crores of rupees.

No fear of law

Interestingly, the participants seem to have lost all fear of the police in several areas as it would only invite milder punishments and negligible penalties under the Gaming Act. The organisers and the betting parties will have a gala time at cosy locations, enjoying the bloodsport amid serving of biryani and some of the choicest dishes and liquor.

The experienced organisers would deposit the cash collected from the clients at reliable ends far away from the venues. They also prefer to walk the distances towards the forests rather than reaching the arena on motorbikes, in order to avoid seizures by the police. The number of persons involved in the game and the number of cases remain disproportionate to the amounts, roosters and vehicles seized.

On the flip side, it would be technically not possible for the police to seize the roosters, who remain mostly injured and losing a final battle.

According to the Chittoor police records; there has been no respite in the cockfight menace since five years. In 2015, 241 persons were arrested in 44 cases, with a seizure of ₹3.5 lakh, followed by 343 persons arrested in 47 cases with ₹2.10 lakh seized in 2016; 108 persons arrested in 34 cases with a seizure of ₹1.65 lakh in 2017; 389 persons arrested in 56 cases with a seizure of ₹5.4 lakhs; and showing a jump with 406 members and 64 cases with ₹4.44 lakhs in 2019.

Superintendent of Police S. Senthil Kumar has instructed the rural police to keep a strict vigil on the cockfights with only a few days left for the Sankranti festivities.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/4py8ku/article30546380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/149946494col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/far-from-the-madding-crowd/article30546381.ece
151,2020/01/12,A favourite pastime,"Come Sankranti and the dusty grounds in the rural settings become a battle ground. Flesh is slashed and the clay in the arena gets sprinkled with blood.

Sankranti is the harvest festival, and one must be wondering how can it turn into a battleground. Well folks, the inference is about the bloodsport of cockfight or rooster fight or ‘kodi pandem’ as called colloquially.

Going by the history, it is an ancient sport which can be dated back to the old civilisations of Indus, Chinese, Persian or Greek. But it gained historical foothold in Andhra Pradesh with the battle of Palnadu or ‘Palnati yudham’ fought sometime between 1178 and 1182 AD between Nalagamaraju and his step brother Malidevaraju, where a rooster fight was organised to decide the fate of the battle.

Across region

Though in the present day, the main arenas in the State for rooster fights during the festive days are found in the districts of East and West Godavari and Krishna and Guntur, it has gained pace in the recent times in Visakhapatnam also.

Similar to the Godavari and Krishna districts, where stakes go up in crores of rupees during the fights, in the festive season, Visakhapatnam of late has been seeing high stake betting, which are organised albeit illegally.

Rooster fights has been present since long time in the district, but of late, the stakes have gone up, said ACP City Task Force Trinad Rao.

Festive ambience

For the last five to six years, a couple of lawmakers in the city and in the district have been organising open arenas on the outskirts and thousands of people have been visiting them to bet their money on the roosters. The arenas start functioning at least a day before ‘Bhogi’ and continue for about four days. The rooster fights are also organised in private farmhouses, away from the glare of the enforcement agencies.

But this year, with the YSR Congress Party government in power, it is to be seen, how things shape up.

Police say that this year it will not be allowed, as in the previous years the lawmakers reportedly had protection from the higher ups in the government.

Fake currency

One trend that has emerged in the last few years, is the exchange of fake Indian currency at the arenas.

""The stakes fly high and cash in huge quantity is exchanged on the spot. This facilitates the easy exchange of fake currency. In 2018 and in 2019, about ₹2 lakh fake currency was confiscated during raids at various spots across the district during the festive period,"" said a senior police officer.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/akh6nw/article30546345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/221191509col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a-favourite-pastime/article30546348.ece
152,2020/01/12,"Chief Minister giving caste colour to destroy Amaravati, alleges Naidu","TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Saturday alleged that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was deliberately giving a caste colour to the Amaravati issue to realise his “designs” to shift the capital to Visakhapatnam.

Amid high drama marked by heavy presence of police at all vital junctions here, Mr. Naidu launched the Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti rally, which passed through arterial junctions, covering a distance of 1.5 km. Walking along the road, Mr. Naidu collected donations from people. Addressing a public meeting from an open-top vehicle at Nalugukalla Mandapam, Mr. Naidu said though Amaravati, which comprised several Assembly constituencies in Krishna and Guntur districts, had people of all the communities, which included the dominant SC population, Mr. Reddy was branding the region as one that belonged to a particular community.

Dig at Jagan

Repeatedly calling Mr. Reddy as “pichhi Tughlaq,” the TDP chief said that by mooting to shift the capital to Visakhapatnam, the Chief Minister had authored the destruction of the State. “On what grounds is he shifting the capital from Amaravati to Vizag?” Mr. Naidu questioned.

In order to go ahead with his move, Mr. Reddy was deliberately creating hurdles for Amaravati such as “insider trading and risk of inundation,” Mr. Naidu alleged.

Amaravati was well equipped with the Assembly, High Court and Secretariat, and there was no need to shift the capital, he said. Mr. Naidu took time to explain the distance involved in reaching the Port City for the people of Rayalaseema.

Interestingly, Mr. Naidu made a mention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the one who had laid the stone for Amaravati by bringing the “sacred Yamuna waters and earth.”

‘Land deals in Vizag’

Mr. Naidu alleged that Mr. Reddy and YSRCP MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy hatched a conspiracy to “loot lands in Vizag,” and “this will only send them to jail permanently.” The “destructive politics” being adopted had already led to a serious situation in the State, wherein the investors were backing out of their projects, thus endangering employment generation, he said. Referring to reports of alleged physical attacks on protesting farmers and women in the capital region by the police, Mr. Naidu said the police should introspect on this as people were fighting for a genuine cause. He took a dig at DGP Gautam Sawang saying that he was bent upon creating trouble to the people fighting for Amaravati and was violating Section 144.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8pyyo9/article30546159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12VJNAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chief-minister-giving-caste-colour-to-destroy-amaravati-alleges-naidu/article30546160.ece
153,2020/01/12,Decks cleared for ‘biggest’ Metro Rail project in Vizag,"Ahead of the decision to shift Secretariat to Visakhapatnam, decks have been cleared for the revised Visakhapatnam Metro Rail Project.

The government has come up with a new plan, extending the metro rail stretch from 42.55 km to 80 km.

The two-phased project is estimated to cost ₹16,000 crore, and will be completed by 2024, according to a top official.

Beyond the metro rail, the government is planning to bring in the tram system, which is popular in Kolkata, to ease the situation in the areas where traffic is lesser compared to that in the metro corridors.

In an exclusive interaction with The Hindu, Amaravati Metro Rail Corporation (AMRC) Managing Director N.P. Ramakrishna Reddy said that a detailed study of traffic from Anakapalle to Bhogapuram had already been conducted by the Urban Mass Transit Company (UMTC).

“We are proposing Metro Rail in the areas where traffic is high. The remaining places, where there is lesser traffic, we are planning to come up with trams. The Detailed Project Report (DPR) will be completed in six months, and the ground work is expected to begin in 10 to 12 months,” he said.

“Once executed, the 80-km Metro Rail project from steel plant to Bhogapuram airport will be the biggest of its kind in the world,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy claimed.

Earlier, the Hyderabad Metro Rail was touted to be the biggest with 72-km stretch.

The government is currently in the process of identifying a consultant to prepare the DPR.

‘Less financial burden’

Unlike in the previous model, the government is planning one that entails least financial burden on the exchequer.

“The idea is to have least government spend by giving concessions and land to the executing company. I’m confident of making the project most viable despite financial hurdles. We could convert the Hyderabad International Airport, Shamshabad, which was initially thought to be the most unviable one, as financially most viable,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy added.

For the record, Mr. Reddy had played a key role in the implementation of the international airport in the combined State.

‘Rechargeable trams’

The government is keen on developing trams in stretches totalling 60 km – NAD to Pendurthi, steel plant to Anakapalle and Old Post Office to Bheemili via Rushikonda on the Beach Road. These trams are most likely to be rechargeable ones.

“We have such trams in some of the advanced countries. Our CM is interested in having such a system here. These sophisticated trams can charge their batteries within a few minutes of their halt at stations,” Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy said.

He put the estimated cost of trams at ₹100 core to ₹120 crore per km.

It is given to understand that the government also proposes to change the name of AMRC to Andhra Pradesh Metro Rail Corporation to suit its activities across the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/83icdm/article30546044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11vz-metro-graphiccol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/decks-cleared-for-biggest-metro-rail-project-in-vizag/article30546045.ece
154,2020/01/12,Tomorrow’s Congress meeting to decide new KPCC chief,"Amidst hectic lobbying for top posts by power groups within the Congress, all eyes are now on the AICC meeting on Tuesday where the appointment of KPCC president and a likely new Leader of the Opposition and Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader is expected to come up for discussion.

Ever since Dinesh Gundu Rao and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah tendered their resignations to the posts of KPCC president, and CLP leader and Leader of the Opposition, respectively, in the light of Congress receiving a drubbing in the bypolls, sections within the party have been lobbying intensively to secure these posts.

The discussion may have reached a final stage with leaders Madhusudan Mistry, Ghulam Nabi Azad, and K.C. Venugopal providing their inputs to the top AICC leaders, including interim president Sonia Gandhi. Mr. Siddaramaiah has been invited to Delhi for discussions on Tuesday. Sources close to former Minister D.K. Shivakumar claimed that he has also been invited to the meeting.

The key persons for appointment to these posts include Mr. Siddaramaiah, former Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara, and Mr. Shivakumar.

Several permutations and combinations are at play along with strategies by leaders that are being worked out to gain an upper hand in the party. While caste combinations are being worked out, more importantly it is the balance between the power centres in the party that is making the appointments more complex.

Party sources said that while Mr. Siddaramaiah’s camp is keen on retaining its hold within the party, original Congressmen are equally trying to gain powerful posts. Mr. Shivakumar, who is known to have an uncomfortable relationship with the former Chief Minister, is being seen sympathetically by the party high command after he spent 50 days in Tihar Jail on the charge of money laundering.

In the race

Sources said that besides Mr. Shivakumar, another former Minister Krishna Byre Gowda from the Vokkaliga community, and two former Ministers M.B. Patil and Eshwar Khandre are also in the race with the thought of appointing leaders from dominant communities — Vokkaligas and Lingayats — to key party posts so as to recover lost ground in Old Mysore region and North Karnataka. Sources said that former Minister H.K. Patil has also put his hat in the ring.

Speculations are also rife that Mr. Siddaramaiah, considering his senior position and capability, could be taken into a national role by the party. However, a party source said that he was not keen to leave State politics.

When asked if the Congress will have a new Leader of the Opposition and CLP leader, sources in Mr. Siddaramaiah’s camp did not confirm or deny. “We do not know what the meeting’s agenda is. The issue may come up for discussion,” sources said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tomorrows-congress-meeting-to-decide-new-kpcc-chief/article30551814.ece
155,2020/01/12,Cabinet expansion: Yediyurappa fails to get appointment with high command,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is reportedly upset with the BJP high command for not giving him an appointment to hold consultations on Cabinet expansion, resulting in its delay.

While the Chief Minister has been facing pressure from the newly elected MLAs for an immediate expansion, the party high command has been delaying it, putting him in a spot, his close associates say.

Mr. Yediyurappa has had to cancel his trip to Delhi, scheduled for Sunday and Monday, as Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not give him an appointment. “I will meet Mr. Shah and discuss Cabinet expansion when he comes to the State on January 18,” he told mediapersons on Saturday.

He recently announced that he was unlikely to go to Davos to attend the annual meeting of World Economic Forum, as scheduled earlier, over the same issue.

The Chief Minister had earlier found it difficult to get an appointment with Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah over flood-relief assistance to the State in August-September 2019, leaving him embarrassed. He had raised the issue of “inadequate flood assistance” at a recent public rally in the presence of Mr. Modi in Tumakuru, following which the Union government released the second instalment of ₹1,869 crore.

Sources said that the Chief Minister raising the issue with the Prime Minister on a public platform has not gone down well with the high command. “Mr. Yediyurappa is the senior-most Chief Minister of the BJP today and he cannot be snubbed time and again like this, especially after he won 12 of the 15 seats in the bypolls and strengthened his government, proving his popularity in the State,” a senior MLA close to him said.

Meanwhile, the newly elected party-hopper MLAs have met twice and are exerting pressure on the Chief Minister to induct them into the Cabinet immediately, sources said. The Chief Minister had publicly assured the ‘rebels’ that they would be inducted into the Cabinet within 24 hours of their victory. But it has been over a month now and there is no clear idea on when the expansion will take place.

The MLAs have also turned wary as the Chief Minister was now trying to convince at least two MLAs from Belagavi to accept nominations to boards and corporations, instead of ministries.

Dy. CM posts

Another bone of contention between the Chief Minister and the high command delaying decision on Cabinet expansion is over Deputy Chief Ministers, sources in the party said.

“Mr. Yediyurappa wants all Deputy Chief Minister posts to be scrapped. Creating three deputies to him was the high command’s decision to keep him in check and also groom new leadership, as the Chief Minister is beyond the 75-year age limit already. Both the high command and the Chief Minister are driving a hard bargain over the issue,” said a senior minister, who did not wish to be named.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q80xaq/article30551801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGBSYAMITSHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cabinet-expansion-yediyurappa-fails-to-get-appointment-with-high-command/article30551802.ece
156,2020/01/12,Joshi tears into Congress for‘misleading’ people on CAA,"Asserting that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will not snatch the rights of any citizen, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi has attacked the Congress for misleading the people over the Act meant for giving citizenship to religiously persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

He was talking to reporters before taking part in a pro-CAA awareness campaign in Raichur on Sunday.

He said that after election defeats, a desperate Congress has started talking not only against Prime Minister but also against the nation. “The language of the Congress and Pakistan are one and the same,” he added.

Mr. Joshi said that the Union government has amended the Act to give citizenship to migrants of neighbouring countries. “The number of minorities in Pakistan has drastically come down to 2 % from 22 % due to atrocities and conversion. To prevent such activities, the government has taken steps to help them,” he said.

India has successfully exposed Pakistan-supported terrorism to the outside world. But, the Congress has been trying to obstruct the efforts of the government, the Minister said.

Mr. Joshi also trained his guns at the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumarswamy and Congress MLA U.T. Khader stating that the Mangaluru police have already clarified on the CDs released by Mr. Kumaraswamy who, he said, is in the habit of making hit-and-run allegations. He further said that Mr. Khader should be asked if there would be any harm caused to anybody if the Act is implemented.

Backing the police action during the violence in Mangaluru, the Minister said that the police should not blamed when they initiate the right steps to maintain law and order.

Asked about the inclusion of Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh in Karnataka, as people in that district of Andhra Pradesh are demanding, Mr. Joshi said that there are several issues, including the border row with Andhra Pradesh. “Instead of raking this up, we should focus on development,” he said.

“Steps to improving GDP have been taken and we will introduce a good budget,” he said.

At the awareness rally, Mr. Joshi said that the party and its leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, have stooped to a new low by criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah in connection with the passing of the Act.

He dared the Congress to come out with a decision announcing restoration of Article 370 in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and its rejection of the CAA. “I challenge the Congress leaders to announce openly that they won’t implement the CAA and also restore Article 370, if they come to power,” he said.

He also said that the BJP was implementing the CAA after the Congress failed to fulfil its promise made in the election manifesto. But, he noted, the same Congress is, surprisingly, now opposing the Act.

N. Ravikumar, MLC and State general secretary of the BJP, said that intellectuals are supporting anti-nationalists in opposing CAA which has nothing to do with the rights of Indian minorities. “The government has already promised the minorities that they won’t be harmed with the implementation of Act. However, the Congress is creating fear among the people,” he said.

Raja Amareshwar Naik, MP, spoke.

Earlier, the awareness march was taken out from Karnataka Sangha to Mahatma Gandhi stadium and participants carried a 300-ft Tricolor.

Mr. Joshi was felicitated during the event.

157,2020/01/12,"Depression, general anxiety form 34% of mental health cases in Karnataka: Report","More than a million people sought mental healthcare in public health institutions across Karnataka during 2018-19, and depression and general anxiety disorders constituted 34% of the cases. This is according to the Karnataka Mental Health Report-2019, brought out by CHD Group, a public health organisation based out of Mangaluru.

According to the report, severe mental health issues (schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) and alcohol and substance abuse constituted 18.4% and 11.2% of the cases, respectively. The rest fell in the category of suicide and diseases involving co-morbid conditions, referral cases, idiopathic ailments, and rare diseases.

The report noted that only 0.37% of the State’s budget health expenditure was allocated towards mental health, of which 74.4% and 62.4% were utilised by the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) and Manasadhara, respectively. The DMHP has been implemented in all 30 districts since 2016-17.

Among the common mental disorders, the most were reported from Raichur district (17.7%), followed by Bidar (9.3%), Chickballapur (7.7%), and Bengaluru Urban (7.5%). The lowest number of cases were reported in Vijayapura (0.6%), Yadgir (0.7%) and Kodagu (0.8%).

Over the course of the year, 1,874,330 cases of severe mental disorder were reported across the State’s public health institutions. Raichur (13.2%) accounted for the most, followed by Bidar (7.3%) and Ballari (6.1%). Kodagu (0.7%) and Chikkamagaluru (1%) reported the least number of cases. Such cases were higher in Bengaluru Urban (4.1%) than Bengaluru Rural (1.7%).

A majority of alcohol and substance use disorders were reported from Raichur (25.1%), followed by Chickballapur (17.3%) and Bidar (15.7%). Bengaluru Urban (4.2%) reported more cases than Bengaluru Rural (1.3%).

The elderly

The study also revealed high prevalence of mental disorders among the elderly in several districts. Factors such as lack of support and social isolation from family members, limited mobility, and inadequate awareness about the treatments available for mental disorders can further deteriorate mental health among the elderly, the report said.

In December 2019, the Rashi Idi variety was traded at around ₹34,200 a quintal in the Shivamogga market and there were no fluctuations during the month.

However, the prices started to move northwards from January 2, bringing cheer to farmers. The price of the Rashi Idi variety of arecanut hit ₹36,600 on January 11. There has been a similar rise in the prices of Saraku, Bette and Gorabalu varieties.

D.M. Shankarappa, an arecanut merchant and former president of Shivamogga District Chamber of Commerce and Industries, told The Hindu that in the past 10 days, the prices have increased by around 7%. He attributed it to the mismatch between demand and supply.

Hit by drought

The yield had declined in semi-arid and arid regions in Karnataka owing to the moisture stress caused by drought that prevailed for three consecutive summers from 2017. Arecanut cultivated on more than 7,000 hectares completely dried up owing to scarcity of water in Davangere district in 2019.

Crop loss was reported in plantations in Malnad region owing to fruit rot disease, or kole roga, caused by heavy rain in August and September 2019. In Shivamogga district alone, arecanut crop on more than 13,000 hectares was infected with kole roga during this period.

Rajesh, an arecanut grower and merchant from Channagiri in Davangere district, said the crop is sensitive to changes in climate. He said that the harvest has almost completed in the major arecanut-growing districts of Shivamogga, Uttara Kannada, Davangere and Chikkamagaluru, and farmers had disposed of the major chunk of their inventories. The demand-supply gap is likely to widen in the coming days and that may cause further price rise, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/z07ifw/article30554941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGARECA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yield-decline-pushes-up-arecanut-prices-by-7-in-10-days/article30550568.ece

“That the CAA is harmful to minorities is a lie spread by the Congress,” he said. Leaders like Sonia Gandhi and Rahu Gandhi are speaking the language of Imran Khan, Pakistan Prime Minister, he alleged.

Mr. Ravikumar accused the Congress of spreading lies over the CAA and urged them not to destroy the social fabric of the nation.

“The law is for people who have fled three countries owing to religious persecution and those who cannot go back,” he said. He alleged that Hindus in Pakistan remained deprived of their fundamental human rights.

Mr Ravikumar told the crowd that the CAA is meant to protect such minorities.

163,2020/01/12,Courts faced with new questions on freedom of expression: CJI,"Can playing loud music on a sound system at a wedding or at a place of worship be considered an integral part of freedom of expression? The judiciary, which had to deal with the question on whether Internet can be part of freedom of expression on Friday in the Supreme Court, is confronted with such emerging issues daily, said Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde on Saturday.

Speaking after inaugurating the 19th biennial State-level conference of judicial officers, organised by the Karnataka State Judicial Officers’ Association, he said the explosion of knowledge and system of communication warrant interdisciplinary approaches and analysis.

“Yesterday, the Supreme Court pronounced on whether Internet can be part of the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution. These are points which the judiciary is being called upon to decide... For instance, if there is a marriage pandal or any temple, mosque or any other place which is loudly playing music through a sound system, the question of whether utilisation of a sound system is integral to freedom of expression could arise,” he said.

“These are things which the Judiciary is being called upon to determine daily. An understanding of human rights and democratic accountability provides new parameters for appraising judicial functioning in our society. Judges without adequate knowledge, skills and experience may cause distortion, delay and miscarriage of justice,” the CJI said.

Recommending reforms in judicial education, he said that judges are made, not born. “The quality of a judge and the quality of the judicial process in large measure is contingent upon the quality of learning and experience obtained by him. A key question, therefore, will be how we can we improve the quality of judges,” he said.

Moot courts

Justice Bobde went on to say that it is a common perception that moot courts are organised only to train law students. “I wonder if this method of moot court could be adapted and introduced at judicial academies for training judges. Questions that a judge should ask or should not ask are all matters which require training and education,” he said.

Referring to the Ayodhya case, he said, “In a recent case which was decided by the Supreme Court, we had to deal with religious concepts, the value of archaeology, whether it was scientific or not, the land revenue records, and almost everything under the sun. It is the Bar which assists us, but judges must have knowledge about all this.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nxi9k/article30546353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGBOBDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/courts-faced-with-new-questions-on-freedom-of-expression-cji/article30546354.ece
164,2020/01/12,‘Free Kashmir’ placard: Protester grilled by Mysuru police,"The woman who held aloft a “Free Kashmir” placard during a recent protest in Mysuru against the violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) was grilled by the Mysuru police for several hours on Saturday.

Nalini Balakumar, an alumna of the University of Mysore’s Department of Studies in Mass Communication and Journalism, appeared before the Jayalakshmipuram police after receiving a notice in connection with a sedition case booked over the display of the placard.

Ms. Nalini arrived at the police station accompanied by her father Balakumar. Though sources said Ms. Nalini was posed a set of 80 to 100 questions, City Police Commissioner K.T. Balakrishna said the investigating officer had taken a statement from her as per the set procedure.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) M. Muthuraj said, “She was allowed to leave, but was told to make herself available to the police for questioning in future, if necessary.”

Unconditional apology

Ms. Nalini, before appearing in front of the police, released a video clarifying that her intention was only to bring to notice the Internet shutdown in Kashmir for the past five months. “I never intended to cause any kind of hatred,” she said. She apologised to the police and the public for the confusion created by her action.

Ms. Nalini, who had secured interim bail from a city court on Friday evening, executed a personal bond for a sum of ₹1 lakh with one surety for a similar sum.

The Second Additional District Judge, who granted her interim bail, directed her release on bail in the event of arrest in connection with the case, booked under Sections 34 and 124A of the Indian Penal Code. Her petition is scheduled to be come up for hearing again on Tuesday.

Ms. Nalini had earlier clarified that she was not affiliated to any organisation. “I am a simple person interested in the functioning of my country,” she said.

She also said she would have to engage a new lawyer when her petition comes up for hearing, as the counsel who argued for her interim bail had retired owing to “personal reasons”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/free-kashmir-placard-protester-grilled-by-mysuru-police/article30546316.ece
165,2020/01/12,Shivakumar appeals for peace in Kanakapura ahead of Jagaraja Vedike rally,"Congress leader and MLA for Kanakapura D.K. Shivakumar has appealed for communal harmony and peace in the town, that recently saw a controversy erupt over the installation of a Jesus Christ statue atop Kapala Betta.

This plea on Saturday comes in the backdrop of a rally planned by senior RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat in the town on Monday. The rally is being organised by the Hindu Jagarana Vedike. Several BJP leaders have opposed the installation of the statue and claimed it to be a land scam.

“The people of Kanakapura have been living in harmony for centuries now. The rally is a conspiracy by communal forces to disturb this. I appeal to the people of the town not to be provoked and let any untoward incident happen,” Mr. Shivakumar said in a statement.

Meanwhile, K.T. Ullas, general secretary, south Karnataka, Hindu Jagarana Vedike, said, “We demand that the State government cancel the allotment of gomala land where the statue is coming up. We have got permission from the police to hold the rally. We will also hold a public meeting,” he said.

166,2020/01/12,Emulsion explosives held the key: expert,"The use of emulsion explosives and its reduced usage at the blast sites helped in the effective demolition of the concrete buildings while containing its impacts, said R. Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives.

Speaking to The Hindu in the post-demolition scenario, Dr. Venugopal said the controlled implosions carried out at the sites had brought down Golden Kayaloram, Jain Coral Cove, H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene as planned. The impact was contained mostly within the compound walls of the structures. All the buildings could be brought down in the exact angle as planned, he said.

For Holy Faith, only 212 kg of explosives were used against the 215 kg ordered, 14.5 kg in Golden Kayaloram against 125kg, and 343 kg at Alfa Serene against 600 kg. It was only at Jain Coral Cove that the explosives were used above the earlier estimation.

Here 372 kg of explosives had to be used against the 312 kg considering the size of the building, he said.

While reducing the quantity of the explosives, the length of detonating fuse was increased, which improved the efficiency of the blasts while reducing its impact, he said.

Vibrations’ duration

According to A. Bhoominathan, Head of the Civil Engineering Department of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, who led a team of experts that assessed the vibrations created by the explosions, the short duration of the vibrations triggered by the explosions, and the distance between the buildings and the point of origin of the vibrations saved the nearby structures from any significant damage.

The vibrations generated from Jain Coral Cove lasted 12 seconds, while it was 8 seconds for Golden Kayaloram. The average duration of the vibrations in Maradu demolition was less than 10 seconds, he said.

The vibrations created by earthquakes would last longer. In one of the recent earthquakes which rocked Japan, it lasted two minutes. Any vibration that exceeds 30 seconds will leave a high impact.

While the frequency of common earthquakes range from 0.1 Hz to 5 Hz, the vibration from the demolition had frequencies starting from 4 Hz and continued to high frequency ranges. This is another reason for the minimal damage, he said.

No cracks

The control room set up 120 metres away from Jain Coral Cove was shaken by the ground vibration generated by the blasts. However, no major cracks were found in a building located nearly 20 metres from the building. The department will submit its report to Maradu municipality shortly, said Dr. Bhoominathan.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bkmm6o/article30552253.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tvblastvenu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/emulsion-explosives-held-the-key-expert/article30552254.ece
167,2020/01/12,"On second day too, demolition goes as per plan at Maradu","Golden Kayaloram, the fourth illegal apartment complex in Maradu that was asked to be pulled down by the Supreme Court, was razed to the ground on Sunday afternoon.

It took a few seconds and 15 kg of explosives to bring down the 17-floor structure without leaving any impact on the nearby structures, including a Anganwadi building outside the compound wall of the apartment complex. Earlier in the day, multiple blasts triggered inside Jain Coral Cove reduced the biggest apartment complex among the four to rubble. Both the demolitions proved to be precision jobs as they left the nearby homes and other buildings untouched. All the blasts took place as planned, said R. Venugopal, the Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, who oversaw the job.

H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene, the two other illegal structures, were knocked down on Saturday as ordered by the apex court.

Court talks tough

It required around nine months and some tough talking by the Supreme Court for the State government to act against the violations. Since its landmark judgement on May 8, 2019, the Supreme Court Bench headed by Arun Misra had closely monitored the implementation of its decision to demolish the four apartments that were constructed in violation of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules.

The State government was forced to file a timeline for demolition after the court ordered the personal appearance of Chief Secretary Tom Jose and warned of serious repercussions. It was on an appeal filed by the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority against the High Court order the apex court passed the judgement.

Kapico is next

After the Maradu mission, the State government will soon have to chart out a plan for removing the 54 apartments of the Kapico Kerala Resorts built at Nediyathuruthu in Vembanad Lake.

A three-member Bench of the court had on Friday ordered its demolition after it was found that the apartment had violated CRZ rules.

On Monday, when the Supreme Court takes up the case, the counsel for the State government will make an oral submission about the Maradu demolition works. There will not be any written submission on the developments as the demolition was completed only by Sunday afternoon, said senior Environment Department officials.

Photos on demolition

The Ernakulam District Collector has been asked to despatch pictures of the demolition, which may be submitted to the court.

If asked, the government will also apprise the court of the progress achieved regarding the actions contemplated against other CRZ violations in the State, the official said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3kgelh/article30552231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Golden-Kayaloram-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/on-second-day-too-demolition-goes-as-per-plan-at-maradu/article30552232.ece

The police have not divulged the identities of those in custody and have not ruled out links between the gang and the two suspects, Abdul Shameem and M. Thoufique. The gang was handed over to the Tamil Nadu police for interrogation.

CCTV visuals

Meanwhile, the police recovered a CCTV footage that purportedly showed the suspected duo walking in the Neyyattinkara town around 8 p.m., a little over an hour before the police officer was murdered near the Kerala border. While the clip suggested that they were in the Thiruvananthapuram district prior to the crime, the police were yet to ascertain the veracity of the clips.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/police-officer-murder-four-in-custody/article30551983.ece
177,2020/01/12,NPR will not be prepared in State: Pinarayi,"Two days after the Centre notified the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has reiterated that his Left Democratic Front government will not hold the process to prepare a National Population Register (NPR) in the State.

Opening an event to uphold constitutional values, organised by the CPI(M)-backed Keluettan Centre for Study and Research on the Kozhikode beach on Sunday, he vouched for the safety of the minority community.

“I presume that some people are still apprehensive about the NPR and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). We are not going to implement them here. My government will not implement the whims and fancies of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,” Mr. Vijayan said. Soon after both the Houses of Parliament passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, Kerala was one of the few States to declare that it would not implement the NPR and the NRC. In December, the Union government had allocated funds for updating the NPR.

However, Mr. Vijayan clarified that the enumeration process for Census would be held in the State. “But nobody is going to seek proof of your birth in this country. You need not worry about digging up old documents to prove that your ancestors lived here… You are in a safe fortress,” he said. He pointed out that without NPR, the NRC could not be implemented. Mr. Vijayan also accused the BJP of hiding this fact and misleading the people.

He alleged that the CAA was a continuation of the anti-Muslim policies of the Centre.

Earlier, K. Alikkutty Musliyar, general secretary of the Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulema, a forum of Sunni scholars, urged the State government to issue birth certificates to each and every one who was born in Kerala.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/7cekh2/article30455591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvnjn04-CabinGLQ6U5KE73jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/npr-will-not-be-prepared-in-state-pinarayi/article30551974.ece
178,2020/01/12,Erumely Petta Thullal held with traditional fervour,"Petta Thullal, the ritualistic sacred dance marking the last leg of the annual Sabarimala pilgrimage season, was held with traditional fervour at Erumely on Sunday.

Teams of Ayyappa devotees from Ambalappuzha and Alangad performed the ceremonial dance. Thousands thronged the streets here to witness the unique celebration of communal harmony.

The Ambalappuzha group, comprising about 500 devotees and led by Samooha Periyon Kalathil Chandrasekharan Nair, was the first to begin the dance by 12 noon after citing the brahmini kite on the sky.

The group, accompanied by three tuskers, danced down the streets of Erumely and was accorded a reception at the Nainar mosque by the Erumely Mahallu Muslim Jama-ath. After circumambulating the mosque, the group proceeded to the Erumely Sree Dharma Sastha temple.

The 300-member Alangad group, led by Samooha Periyon Ambadath Vijayakumar, began their dance by around 2.30 p.m and was received in front of the Sree Dharma Sastha temple.

Chandanakkudam

179,2020/01/12,Special drive against TB in children,"The State branch of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) has taken up a special drive to implement protocol-based and standardised management of all paediatric TB cases in the State to ensure that all children are TB-free much before the State achieves the 2025 target of total TB elimination.

Paediatric TB cases have been declining rapidly in the State, registering an annual decline of 7.5%. In the past one decade, cases have dropped by one-third. Out of the 6,133 suspected paediatric TB samples tested using CBNAAT in 2019, only 1%, 65 cases, turned out to be positive for TB. At the national level, this rate is 10%.

However, one of the main trends in paediatric TB in the State has been the wide variation in the rates across districts, with inexplicably high proportion of child TB cases in some districts .

“We found that Malappuram and Wayanad have been reporting nearly five times the number of child cases reported by Alappuzha or Idukki. About 19 out of every 100 TB cases in Malappuram are under 14 years. This figure was 16 for Wayanad, 10 for Kasaragod and nine for Kannur. These figures are inexplicably high,” a senior National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (formerly Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme) official said.

The problem was that there was no uniformity in the manner of diagnosis or treatment. Doctors were in all likelihood over-treating children with TB drugs, to be on the safe side, probably because the Mantoux tuberculin skin test was positive (Mantoux test only indicates infection or latent TB, not an active disease state).

“This lack of uniformity in treatment is one of the main issues that IAP intends to tackle this year through a special project, ‘TB-free air for every child in Kerala.’ We are planning to implement protocol-based, standardised management of paediatric TB cases across the State. All our 2,500-odd paediatricians will be trained in the treatment protocol,” IAP State president M. Narayanan said.

Diagnosing TB in children is difficult, because most children cannot produce a sputum sample which can be sent for microbiological analysis. At present, most children are treated for TB presumptively, on the basis of clinical diagnosis alone, rather than through a microbiological confirmation.

The proportion of microbiologically confirmed cases amongst the total paediatric TB cases has been found to be low at just 10% in the State, especially among districts which reported high proportion of paediatric cases.

“IAP paediatric TB guidelines recommend that every attempt must be made to microbiologically confirm diagnosis in children by collecting gastric lavage samples from the stomach by inserting a Ryle’s tube through the nose. We have initiated training programmes for nurses across the State on proper sample collection, so that all districts are encouraged to ensure microbiological confirmation of paediatric TB cases,” Dr. Narayanan said.

Cough etiquette

The IAP will also campaign for addressing some of the determinants of TB such as malnutrition in children and tobacco smoking by adults. Encouraging children to practise cough etiquette and using handkerchiefs and ensuring complete treatment of adults with TB are part of the IAP initiative.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4znt8z/article30551946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tv-TBcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/special-drive-against-tb-in-children/article30551947.ece
180,2020/01/12,Supreme Court hearing on Sabarimala women’s entry begins today,"As the hearing on the review petitions on the verdict granting entry for women of all ages to Sabarimala commences at the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday, the Travancore Devaswom Board and the State government have moved over to a stance to ensure a smooth pilgrimage and stave off attempts to gain political mileage from the issue.

The heavy turnout for the Mandalam and Makaravilakku festivals and the demand from the faithful to create a milieu conducive for peaceful pilgrimages in the coming years seem to have prompted the board to adopt a tempered stance on women’s entry.

Since the court has neither issued a notice nor has elicited its views afresh on the review petitions coming up for hearing on Monday, the board got ample leeway to review the pros and cons.

It weighed the imperative for ensuring peace and tranquillity in Sabarimala and its precincts and the demand for conserving the ritualistic tradition of the temple and finally swerved to a more pragmatic stance.

Interest of devotees

Board sources told The Hindu that the top priority of the TDB was to discharge its bounden duty to safeguard the interest of devotees and also the ritualistic tradition of the temple, but was obliged to abide by the court decision, whatever it maybe.

While delegating the board to take a final call on the issue, the government explicitly expressed its desire that the court should consider its earlier proposal to seek the views of those profound in the custom, rites and tradition of the temple. The government had mooted a similar proposal before the court as a panacea to clear the confusion on the issue and also help the court have a better grasp of all aspects related to the temple.

Though the court did not give due weightage for the proposal, the government has once again flagged it and the board too accepted it.

Political angle

Most importantly, the government seems to be aware of the fallout in providing room for the Sangh Parivar outfits to disrupt law and order again in the guise of protecting faith and tradition and reaping political mileage from the melee.

The Travancore Devaswom Board and the State government seem to have adopted a complementary stance denying room for any bid to politicise the issue.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hphy2g/article30520382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SABARIMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hearing-on-womens-entry-begins-today/article30551921.ece
181,2020/01/12,Alfa Serene and H2O Holy Faith implosions go as planned,"After the successful demolition of two apartments located close to several houses and other structures, stage has been set for pulling down the remaining ones too.

Considering the precision with which Alfa Serene and H2O Holy Faith were brought down without much adverse impact, the demolition of Golden Kayaloram and Jain Coral Cove will be a relatively easy affair, says Snehil Kumar Singh, Fort Kochi RDO, who coordinated the demolition works.

The challenge before demolition experts was that several houses were located close to Alfa Serene. All the protests of local residents seeking protection for their houses were also centred around the apartment complex. Everyone was confident that the blasts would safely bring the apartments down. However, one had to wait till the demolition to be over to assert it. All went well as planned, said Mr. Kumar.

It was the 12-member technical committee that did the magic. The committee took all the important decisions regarding the blasts and it proved to be right, he said.

For Uttkarsh Mehta, partner of Edifice Engineering that pulled down H2O Holy Faith, the job is only half-done as two more structures are to be demolished on Sunday.

The demolition of the apartment went on as planned though a portion of the compound wall of the building collapsed in the process. Barring the first few metres, the compound wall remained intact despite the building being reduced to a heap of rubble, he said.

The blast and the shock waves it triggered did not touch the abandoned building close to the compound wall. However, the windowpane of the security cabin was found shattered.

“After the demolition, we went inside the compound to find that everything went well as planned. Sunday’s demolition will also take place as planned,” said Mr. Mehta.

Reference point for nation

Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives R. Venugopal felt that the Maradu demolition would serve as a reference point for the country to evolve a demolition code. The demolition of Alfa Serene was the most satisfying event as the structures, including houses and a hotel, and the nearby waterbody could be saved from the impact of the demolition.

Though it was initially anticipated that 15% of the debris would fall into the waterbody, hardly 10% fell it to it. It was splinters from the blast and not big concrete pieces that fell into water, thus saving the lake from ecological damage, said Dr. Venugopal.

Environment Secretary Usha Titus, who was in Kochi to oversee the blasts, said the successful implementation of the Supreme Court order regarding the demolition would be reported back to the court on Monday, when the case would again be considered.

The razing of Alfa Serene, said Anand Sharma, blast expert for Vijay Steels that knocked off the apartment complex, was a big challenge as there were 16 houses located on the periphery of the building. A hotel complex was also located close to it and a waterbody was flowing nearby.

The blast could be executed as designed earlier. The debris was contained inside the site itself and it didn’t even hit the compound wall of the apartment complex, said Mr. Sharma.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/cqos3y/article30547881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/All-went-well-iGFR6VH18E4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/alfa-serene-and-h2o-holy-faith-implosions-go-as-planned/article30548358.ece

184,2020/01/12,NSS terms conditions onEWS quota unrealistic,"Close on the heels of moving a resolution to implement 10% reservation for economically weaker sections (EWS) in Devaswom recruitment, the Nair Service Society (NSS) has come out against the State government, terming the criteria set for determining the EWS status as unethical and discriminatory.

In a statement on Saturday, NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair said that the four conditions as stipulated by the latest government notification of November 19, 2019 are indeed unrealistic.

Rule 2 (A) of the notification seeks to leave out those who have one of their family members permanently employed in either a government or quasi-government establishment and those having anyone in their family eligible for paying Income Tax from availing themselves of the reservation.

Exemption

Similarly, people who posses over one acre as family property and having at least one member in their family with a monthly income of ₹25,000 etc too have been exempted from the reservation net.

While applicants from about 150 communities in the non-reservation section will have to satisfy all these conditions to avail themselves of the reservation, the lone condition applicable to candidates in the reservation category is the creamy-layer income limit set by the State government, he said.

“These conditions have been set with an intention to deny benefits to even the most eligible as even the 10% reservation brought in by the Central government stipulates a simple income limit of ₹4 lakh. There is an urgent need for the government to intervene and make necessary corrections,” read the statement.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nss-terms-conditions-onews-quota-unrealistic/article30547026.ece

186,2020/01/12,Congress will fight RSS alone: Mullappally,"Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president (KPCC) Mullappally Ramachandran on Saturday said the Congress would not march in lock-step with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Kerala in its fight against the new citizenship law.

His assertion came a day after the CPI(M) criticised him for ‘aiding’ the agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) by pointedly distancing himself from the anti-citizenship law campaign led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

Attack on CM

It also slammed Mr. Mullappally for his ‘vitriolic attacks’ on Mr. Vijayan.

Mr. Ramachandran said any alliance with the CPI(M) would be a cruel betrayal of the cause of scores of Congress martyrs who had fallen to CPI(M) knives. “The souls of the two Congress men killed by CPI(M) goons in Periye in Kasargode would never forgive us if we join hands with the CPI(M),” he added.

Token gesture

He said Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had shared the stage with the Chief Minister in an anti-CAA gathering to send a message to the Centre. It was a one-off token gesture.

187,2020/01/12,Relief to employees as e-TR5 receipts put off,"The State government’s decision to postpone the implementation of electronic Treasury Receipts-5 (e-TR5) from January 1 to the start of next financial year has come as a big relief to government departments which have been using physical TR5 till now and are confused over the migration to the electronic form.

The government issued an order in this regard on Wednesday based on a proposal submitted by the Director of Treasuries to postpone the implementation of the new system till the start of next financial year citing the need for ‘sufficient time to introduce the same in a foolproof manner.’

The order also directed the Director of Treasuries to ensure preparedness for the new system in consultation with the National Informatics Centre, Director of Printing and Stationery Controller, and furnish an action taken report to the government by the first week of March.

TR5 receipts are issued by all government departments against cash or documents collected from the public and based on which the treasury department verify the amount collected.

“Under the e-TR5 system every office is required to create separate login IDs and passwords, which many offices have not done till now. Also clarifications are needed about the modalities of the system,” district treasury sources said.

The Director of Treasuries had on November 2 last year recommended the introduction of e-TR5 for receipts at cash counters of government departments in place of physical receipts for ensuring real-time assessment of collections and timely remittance of such collections to the treasury.

Sets condition

Following this, the government on November 19 ordered that use of manual TR5 receipts without unique serial numbers should be done away with albeit subject to some conditions from January 1 this year.

The order said that physical TR5 receipts with unique numbering would be limited to collections by departments such as Police, Motor Vehicles, Excise and that the Director of Printing should ensure distribution of available TR5 receipts stamped with unique serial number for use with effect from the New Year.

These departments were in a state of limbo as the TR5 receipts stamped with unique number were not made available on time even as they were not supposed to use receipts devoid of unique numbers. While the Motor Vehicle Department in the district, sensing a potential extension, had been using the old TR5 receipts without unique number, the Excise Department had not been collecting fine since the start of the year owing to the non-availability of unique numbered receipts. The department resumed it only on Wednesday following the government order extending the schedule for the introduction of e-TR5 receipts.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/relief-to-employees-as-e-tr5-receipts-put-off/article30547023.ece

190,2020/01/12,No major spike in pollution levels,"Predictions on the environmental impact of the demolition of two apartment complexes on Saturday were near-perfect. In fact, the implosions that brought down Alpha Serene and Holy Faith H2O did not trigger dangerous dust or sound levels.

The emissions observed were as expected, said an official of the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB). Dust was noticed in cloud form at the monitoring points and the emissions dispersed to normalcy within 45 minutes of the blasts, the official said.

The PCB will now study the impact to assess the approximate quantum of dust emitted by the demolition works. The study will be completed within a week.

It was noticed that some debris from the Alfa Serene residential complex fell into the backwaters but on inspection it was found that the quantum was not significant. However, monitoring of the water was conducted and the result will be out within a week.

“We had deliberately planned that some portion of the building (Alfa) should fall in the water. That was basically to protect the surrounding buildings,” PTI quoted the District Collector as saying. The maximum sound level observed during the blasts was 114 decibels for the whole monitoring period. This level compared well with the sound levels at events such as Thrissur Pooram, where decibel levels go up to 120 dB. The short duration blasts did not trigger a major sound pollution problem.

MGU study

The impact of dust on the quality of Kochi’s air, however, might have been much lesser than expected. The data, collected by a team of researchers from Mahatma Gandhi University, suggest that the value of PM 10 and PM 2.5, two major air pollutants, rose by just 1.75 times of the normal value during six hours after the implosions.

“The value of both these pollutants in the ambient air of Maradu outside the 200-metre exclusion zone was just around 100-160 ppp as against the average normal value of 60-120 ppp. This means the implosions had a rather minuscule impact on the quality of air than in similar instances elsewhere,” said C.T. Aravinda Kumar, Pro Vice Chancellor of the varsity, who heads the initiative.

He attributed this lesser impact of dust to the highly-scattered wind pattern reported during the day, causing a near equal-distribution of the dust.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cgpbnr/article30546284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TVSMOKEMARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-major-spike-in-pollution-levels/article30546282.ece

Kudumbashree Matrimonial cross-checks the information before carrying it. The website currently has over 30,000 profiles in their database and all online registrations are activated only after conducting a round of local enquiry.

Transpersons elated

The community says its is more than elated at the news. “Apart from finding us a suitable partner it will spread a message that we are also part of society and we too have a right to lead a normal life. Many of us have to go through this circle of exploitation, humiliation and betrayal when it comes to relationships and this service will be a great help for us,” says Mahi, a transperson.

Surya and Ishaan K Shaan, the first trans couple from Kerala to have a legal wedding, think it will bring in a huge change by introducing a wide section of society to a world beyond binaries. “We have many members who are into live-in relationships as it’s not easy for transpersons to formalise their marriage. Such changes will bring in a lot of positivity in our lives in terms of acceptance. At the same time, we need changes in many forms including those for marriage registration that identify only two genders,” says Surya.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/8oze3f/article30546252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TVTRANSCOUPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/winds-of-change-in-matchmaking-service/article30546253.ece
193,2020/01/12,Razed homes leave flat owners heartbroken,"Watching H2O Holy Faith, an apartment complex which she once called her home, going down like a pack of cards on television, 90-year-old Santhama was just dumbstruck.

Now living with her daughter Maya Premamohan in a rented apartment at Kakkanad, the nonagenarian simply could not get her head around the logic of a perfect structure being brought down.

“She was asking whether people had turned mad to do such a thing,” said her 60-year-old daughter who had lived with her mother in the apartment for eight years and had been to see it one last time on Friday.

Shamzudeen Karunagapally, president of H2O Apartment Owners Association, had turned up with his 21-year-old son to witness the demolition of their beloved home. “It was a moment of absolute helplessness. But crying would not have changed anything,” he said.

Noormuhammad, who lived in Alfa Serene for over seven years, said he now absolutely hated the entire area of Nettoor. “I have never visited the place since leaving. Let people and the judge who ordered the demolition enjoy the spectacle,” he said from his flat at Mattancherry.

Having lived through the emotional trauma of seeing their apartments pummelled, owners are beginning to turn attention towards claiming their rights over the land where the apartments once stood and better compensation matching their investments.

“There is no question of legally claiming the land as it rightfully belongs to us, and the court had only ordered the demolition of structures that stood there. The authorities will have to remove the debris and restore the land to us,” said Alex Joseph, a 68-year-old former occupant of an apartment at Alfa Serene.

He added that a decision on future legal recourse will be taken after the apex court takes up the case on Monday and depending on the future mandate of the Balakrishnan Nair Commission appointed by the court for overseeing the distribution of compensation.

“We were cheated by the government, officials, and the builders and have the right to be duly compensated,” Ms. Premamohan said.

Legal battle on cards

Mr. Shamzudeen said a legal battle would be launched for the rightful compensation. He claimed that the apex court had directed the authorities to pay compensation proportionate to the payments the owners had made to the builders.

“Apartment owners have undivided ownership of the land. Once the debris is removed, we will rope in architects and legal experts for a feasibility study and submit a report to the Central and State governments and the departments concerned seeking permission for building an apartment complex to accommodate all of us,” he said.

Mr. Noormuhammad hoped that the owners had a right over the land since it was registered in their names.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/c1u0dl/article30547884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Apartment-ownerGLG6VH6VM3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/razed-homes-leave-flat-owners-heartbroken/article30546249.ece
194,2020/01/12,‘Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo’ review: This Trivikram Srinivas and Allu Arjun film hits the right notes,"Early on in the film, social strata divisions and envy are spelt out clear. Valmiki (Murali Sharma) hardly takes a moment to cherish the news that his wife (Rohini) has delivered a boy. He resents the fact that in the same hospital, his erstwhile colleague and now employer Ramachandra (Jayaram) and his wife (Tabu) have also been blessed with a son, and that’s happened in a more comfortable special ward.

A turn of events later when the respective boys grow up, Valmiki dutifully watches over Ramachandra’s son Raj (Sushanth) while putting down his son Buntu (Allu Arjun) at every given opportunity. Ramachandra is all that Valmiki can never be and the latter lets the resentment grow.

Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo Cast: Allu Arjun, Pooja Hegde, Murali Sharma, Jayaram and Tabu

Director: Trivikram Srinivas

Music: S S Thaman

Trivikram Srinivas sets the stage for a solid drama of relationships and doesn’t disappoint. Teaming up with Allu Arjun after Julayi and S/O Satyamurthy, he extracts an empathetic performance that also packs in Allu Arjun’s trademark swag.

The strained bond between Valmiki and Buntu plays out well, making it easy to empathise with Buntu’s predicament. He’s at a loss to know why nothing he does can impress his father and why he’s kept at arm’s length.

If that’s Buntu’s plight, very little is revealed about Raj. Inside Ramachandra’s palatial house (Vaikunthapuram), we get just glimpses of everyone — his wife (Tabu), father in law (Sachin Khedekar), Raj and the girl he loves (Nivetha Pethuraj).

The layers will peel gradually, but not before the hero gets an aspirational job in a travel company run by Amulya (Pooja Hegde) and does some globetrotting. Buntu keeps staring at his boss Amulya’s legs (really? why is this passed off as comedy?) and is sent on punishment travels, first to a desert and next to a freezing cold destination. The third trip takes him to Paris, with Amulya, just in time for the hit number ‘Samajavaragamana’ by Sid Sriram. S S Thaman, by the way, has dished out one of his best albums in recent times. Rahul Ramakrishna as the colleague has a brief part but makes his presence felt.

When the narrative moves to its core plot, a few well conceived segments underline that Trivikram is back in form. The episode that juxtaposes how Raj on one hand and Amulya and Buntu on the other deal with their business opponents is a well written one. This segment also lets us in a little more into Ramachandra’s thinking process.

When it’s time to shake up things and place Buntu amid the large family, frictions are laid out in the open. The film largely rides on Allu Arjun and takes a long time to reveal what the other characters are thinking. The poised silence and restraint from Tabu makes sense when her hurt is revealed and when she asks Jayaram ‘don’t I deserve a sorry after all these years?’ Tabu gets a role with limited scope but each time she’s on screen, it’s hard not to notice how she carries herself and the little things she does. Jayaram impresses and hopefully we will see him in more Telugu films.

The film is packed with many well known names; a few get scenes that are worthy of their presence while many others remain bystanders, merely roped in to be a part of a big project. Sushanth gets very little, rather late. Nivetha Pethuraj and Navdeep are among those who are short changed. Samuthirakani as Appala Naidu and Govind Padmasoorya as Paidithalli are, again, brief parts.

Ultimately, it’s Allu Arjun’s show and he goes all out. The scene where he discovers a truth and the confrontation that follows is among the film’s best segments. He and Murali Sharma (he’s so good that you’ll hate him) have quite a few run-ins as well.

P S Vinod’s cinematography and the chic styling work to the advantage of the film.

Once a key revelation is made, the story takes a familiar route but still manages to charm with subtle nuances. Can a mother accept someone who turns out to be better than her son? When a son doesn’t yearn for wealth or identity, why does he step up and fight the battles? It answers such questions and more.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/j489m3/article30549121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ala-vaikunthapurramuloo,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ala-vaikunthapurramuloo-review-this-trivikram-srinivas-and-allu-arjun-film-hits-the-right-notes/article30549122.ece
195,2020/01/12,Wrong to boycott Deepika Padukone or her film: Sanjay Raut,"Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday came out in support of actor Deepika Padukone, who is facing flak from the BJP and some other quarters over her visit to the JNU campus in Delhi to express solidarity with students who were recently attacked by armed assailants.

Mr. Raut, who is a Rajya Sabha member and the executive editor of Shiv Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’, said the country cannot be run in a “Talibani” style.

After Ms. Padukone’s visit to the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Tuesday, many appreciated her “silent solidarity”, but some others criticised her for “supporting Leftists”, saying it was a promotional stunt for her latest film ‘Chhapaak’.

Some also demanded a boycott of her film, based on the life of an acid attack survivor, played by Ms. Padukone.

A section of BJP leaders also criticised the actor over her JNU visit.

Talking to PTI, Mr. Raut said, “The demand for boycott of the actress and her film is wrong. The country cannot be run in a ‘Talibani’ style.”

“Chhapaak”, directed by Meghna Gulzar, hit the theatres on Friday.

196,2020/01/12,Pongal spells peril for Salem’s foxes,"With Kaanum Pongal, the fourth and final day of the harvest festival, less than a week away, Forest Department officials in Salem are gearing up to prevent an unusual jallikattu — one that uses foxes instead of bulls.

The jallikattu-like event using foxes, or vanga nari in Tamil, is usually organised on Kaanum Pongal on the outskirts of the district as villagers believe it will bring bountiful rain and good fortune.

According to Forest officials, villagers, mostly from Ranganoor, Chinnamanaikenpalayam and Vadugathampatti in Vazhapadi taluk trap the foxes and bring them to the village temple.

Regular feature

The animals are muzzled and their hind legs tied with rope. After special rituals are conducted, the hapless animals are chased through the streets, much like bulls in the more conventional jallikattu. After the event, the animals are released into the forest.

Despite a ban, the event has been organised for decades now. District Forest Officer A. Periasamy said, “We have fined the violators earlier for organising the event and trespassing into forest areas and this year too, we will take stern action.”

Officials said foxes are a protected species under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and hunting or capturing them is prohibited.

V. Gokul, president of the Salem Nature Society, said, “The medium-sized Bengal foxes are generally found near agricultural areas. The animal undergoes cruel treatment in the name of this festival. The animal is gagged and the hind legs are tied. Capturing a wild animal itself is an offence, and this helpless animal is tortured in the name of the festival.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/w046i5/article30552013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THRDFOX1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pongal-spells-peril-for-salems-foxes/article30552014.ece
197,2020/01/12,Former T.N. Chief Secretary Panikar no more,"C.V.R. Panikar, former Chief Secretary and Chairman of the State Planning Commission, died at his residence in Besant Nagar, Chennai, on Sunday morning. He was 93. His wife, who predeceased him in 1991, was the sister of wife of former National Security Adviser and West Bengal Governor M.K. Narayanan.

Santha Sheela Nair, former Secretary of the Union Ministry of Mines who worked under Mr. Panikar in the early 1980s and a family friend of his, said the funeral would take place on Monday afternoon.

Born in August 1926, Mr. Panikar, who studied history at the Presidency College, Chennai, belonged to the 1949 batch of IAS officers of the Tamil Nadu cadre. He served in many positions of the State government, including Chairman and Managing Director of the Tamil Nadu Industries Development Corporation and Vigilance Commissioner.

Weeks after the DMK Ministry was dismissed in January 1976 and the State was brought under President’s rule, he was made Second Secretary, a position immediately subsequent to the post of Chief Secretary. In February 1977, he succeeded V. Karthikeyan as Chief Secretary and held the post till the end of June that year. A year after he retired from service in August 1984, he became, in July 1985 Chairman of the State Planning Commission, a position that subsequently came to be occupied by Chief Ministers and held the post for a year.

P.N. Vedanarayanan, president of the Tamil Nadu Retired IAS Officers’ Association, described Mr. Panikar as one who belonged to the school of civil servants who were “traditionally dispassionate.” C. Ramachandran, a cousin of Mr. Panikar and former Expenditure Secretary in the Union government, said the former Chief Secretary was known to be an upright and conscientious officer.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2g3acs/article30550567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Panicker,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/former-tn-chief-secretary-panikar-no-more/article30549389.ece
198,2020/01/12,Ex-armyman hacked to death by teenage son in Mettupalayam,"The Mettupalayam police arrested a teenager who hacked to death his father, an ex-serviceman, late on Saturday.

The deceased has been identified as A. Karuppusamy, 45, a resident of Siraj Nagar, Sirumugai road, Mettupalayam.

The police arrested his 17-year-old son in connection with the murder early on Sunday.

The police said that Mr. Karuppusamy and his wife Amuthavalli separated six years ago, allegedly due to his alcoholism and domestic violence.

Ms. Amuthavalli, her two sons, aged 14 and 17, were staying in her mother’s house at Irumporai near Sirumugai.

On Saturday, Mr. Karuppusamy telephoned Ms. Amuthavalli in an inebriated state and abused her.

Provoked by this, the 17-year-old boy went to his father’s place around 11.45 p.m., shouted at him and allegedly attempted to assault his father.

Mr. Karuppusamy also took a sickle from the kitchen and tried to attack his son.

However, the son grabbed the sickle from father and hacked him. Mr. Karuppusamy died on the spot.

201,2020/01/12,Cross-voting lends edge to AIADMK-led front,"The ruling AIADMK-led front, which finished next to the DMK-led combine in bagging wards of district panchayats (DP) and panchayat unions (PU) in 27 districts, on Saturday sprang a surprise by netting more posts of chairpersons of both DPs and PUs than its principal rival, in indirect elections.

Of the 26 chairpersons of DPs, the AIADMK-led combine won in 14 and the DMK’s front in the rest. In Sivaganga, the poll to the district panchayat council was deferred due to the absence of elected representatives. As for the 314 chairpersons of PUs, the former secured 150 and the latter 133. Direct elections took place in two phases on December 27 and 30, for which the results were declared between January 2 and 4.

The day also witnessed instances of violence in different parts of the State, forcing the postponement of the election process in several panchayat unions.

At the Narikudi panchayat union office in Virudhunagar district, Aruppukottai Deputy Superintendent of Police Venkatesan was assaulted with a sharp weapon during the clash between cadres of the rival Dravidian parties. Violence was reported in the Uthangarai panchayat union of Krishnagiri district and at Morappur of the neighbouring Dharmapuri district. Elections were deferred in both places.

The victory of the AIADMK-led front was apparently possible due to cross-voting on the part of the Opposition, especially the DMK. An obvious instance was the Pudukottai DP council.

The DMK-led alliance had 13 members out of 22 in the Pudukottai district panchayat. The expectation, prior to the day’s polling, was that the DMK nominee would romp home easily. But, it was the AIADMK’s nominee, T. Jayalakshmi, who emerged the winner, securing the confidence of 12 members against 9 votes scored by the DMK candidate in the election. Three councillors belonging to the DMK-Congress voted in her favour.

A similar pattern could be seen in many panchayat unions. As per an estimate on the basis of wards won, the DMK should be ahead by at least 20 PUs. But, eventually, the AIADMK took control of 15 more PUs than the DMK, without taking into account the number of PUs won by the former’s allies.

The development disturbed the Opposition and the Communist Party of India, one of the allies of the DMK, termed it a “murder of democracy”. In a statement, R. Mutharasan, secretary of the State unit of the CPI, accused the ruling party of having disturbed law and order in Watrap panchayat union of Sivaganga district and forced the deferment of the poll.

On the issue of cross-voting, Kovai Sathyan, spokesperson of the AIADMK, argued that this only reflected the lack of confidence of members of the DMK. “Those who voted for us are not gullible persons and they have realised that joining hands with the AIADMK will only serve the interests of those who elected them,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4n8v8r/article30546724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/local-bodiescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cross-voting-lends-edge-to-aiadmk-led-front/article30546725.ece

In a statement, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the incident raised concerns over whether terrorism had been spreading in Tamil Nadu like a few north Indian States.

However, he said the investigation should not come to a final conclusion based on CCTV footage.

“The images recorded on CCTV should not be the only basis to come to a conclusion about who committed the crime, .

203,2020/01/12,Violence mars polls to panchayat union posts,"An armed mob that barged into the Narikudi union office created a pandemonium after the voting through ballot papers for the post of Narikudi Union Chairperson ended in a tie between the AIADMK-supported Independent K. Panchavarnam and DMK candidate S. Kaleeswari.

After throwing stones at the huge posse of police, the gang managed to push itself forward into the union hall where the officials were explaining to the candidates about the next process of indirect election through a draw of lots. Even as the AIADMK members were objecting to this idea, the gang attacked the police.

Deputy Superintendent of Police Venkatesan of Aruppukottai sub-division suffered a cut injury on his right hand. Even as he was bleeding, the mob managed to enter the hall and started to ransack the furniture.

While the DMK has six members, the AIADMK has five members in the 14-member panchayat council. There are two Independents and one AMMK member. The AIADMK supported Ms. Panchavarnam to bolster its strength.

“The ruling party cadres purposefully unleashed violence and stopped the election. The draw of lot could have favoured any side. Still, they did not want to follow the due process of election but were bent upon to stop the election. Sadly, the State administration has also succumbed to the objective of the ruling party,” Tiruchuli MLA and DMK Virudhunagar (North) District secretary, Thangam Thennarasu said.

The police have picked up two persons in connection with the attack on the DSP who was given first aid by a medical team at the panchayat union office premises.

Violence in Watrap

At Watrap Union, the AIADMK and the DMK were locked in a tie with six members each (DMK four and CPI 2). Getting the support of Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam candidate, V. Rekha, became crucial. However, after the counting of votes, DMK’s S. Kannan had secured seven votes and the AIADMK’s M. Sindhumurugan got six votes.

“As the ruling party candidate sought a recount, the RO did it and the results were the same,” said one of the DMK councillors. As one of them tried to snatch the ballot papers, the RO secured them.

But even before the election results could be officially announced, the AIADMK men barged into the hall and the election officials ran helter skelter. Amidst the commotion, the officials announced that the election was stopped. Concurring with the DMK councillor’s narration, CPI councillor R. Kondammal said: “If the officials had not locked the DMK and CPI councillors in a room, they could have attacked us,” she said.

In Ramanathapuram, there were reports of violence during the indirect elections for District Panchayat Chairman and Panchayat Union Chairman posts on Saturday.

Voting for the post of Mandapam Panchayat Union Chairman was delayed due to violence between the AIADMK and the DMK cadre. A section of the DMK cadre objected to the presence of MLA and former minister M. Manikandan inside the office and a quarrel ensued between the ruling party men and the DMK men. Soon, the quarrelling groups started throwing chairs at one another and window panes were shattered. The MLA was forced to move out of the office.

In Bogalur union, the councillors and the party cadres of the DMK blocked the road, alleging haggling of councillors by the ruling party. On Friday, AIADMK men, led by B. Kalimuthu, threw four petrol bombs and assaulted a DMK man identified as M. Bose and his accomplice Viajy with a sword at Devakottai over alleged bargaining in the election.

Sources said that Mr. Bose had housed two Independents and one DMDK councillor of the Kamuthi Union in a remote location near Devakottai in Sivaganga district, to keep the flock intact. However, Mr. Kalimuthu and his men learnt about the location and attacked them with petrol bombs on reaching the spot. The Devakottai police registered a case against 18 persons. Mr. Bose and Mr. Vijay were admitted to Devakottai hospital.

In Dharmapuri district, the indirect election in Morappur union was deferred following agitation by the AIADMK and lathi charge by the police.

DMK’s road roko

In Pudukottai, DMK cadre resorted to road roko at Annavasal, alleging foul play in the indirect election to the post of Annavasal panchayat union chairperson. The AIADMK candidate was declared elected for the post.

Alleging foul play, the DMK members blocked the road on the main road at Annavasal.

They claimed that the officials were hand in glove with the AIADMK and had ensured its victory by declaring a vote as invalid. The protest was withdrawn after an hour with the intervention of police and revenue officials.

Meanwhile, the AIADMK members staged a road roko on Karambakudi-Pudukottai road for about an hour, protesting against the officials for allowing the DMK ward members of Karambakudi panchayat union to caste votes without producing their winning certificates. On information, senior revenue officials held talks with them and subsequently, the protest was withdrawn.

Music in its pure form led to spiritual nourishment of the soul, he added.

‘Tallest figure’

Praising saint composer Thyagaraja as the tallest figure in the world of music, Mr. Naidu said his contribution to the enrichment of Indian cultural heritage could not be quantified.

His compositions cherished over centuries would continue to be treasured by the young and the old for all time to come. Pointing out that share and care was the core of Indian philosophy, Mr.Venkaiah Naidu called upon the people to practice, promote and imbibe this philosophy in children.

Being one of the most ancient civilisations of the world, Indian culture was often described as an amalgamation of several cultures and influenced by a history that was several millennia old, he said.

207,2020/01/12,HC suggests setting up a Press Council of T.N.,"In an attempt to save the interests of genuine journalists and prevent the image of the media from taking a beating, the Madras High Court has embarked on an exercise to identify and weed out those who were roaming around under the cloak of journalists and using it as a shield to indulge in criminal activities such as blackmailing.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan have asked the State government as to why it should not constitute a statutory body, such as the Press Council of India, to take action against bogus and errant journalists. They have also called for details from the police on the criminal cases booked against those claiming to be journalists.

Not stopping with collection of information from the officials, the court suo motu included the Madras Union of Journalists, the Madras Reporters Guild and the Chennai Press Club as respondents to a random writ petition before them and sought to know the credentials of the members as well as office-bearers of these associations.

“When was the last membership enrolment conducted for the associations? When was the last election conducted? Whether fake press people and people unconnected with the profession have entered into the associations and dominating the genuine press people and what are all the acts done by those fake press people,” were the other questions posed by the court.

The judges wanted both the official respondents and the three associations to answer the queries by January 21 without fail. Notices were ordered to be sent to them in person as well by e-mail, courier and WhatsApp. The issue was taken up during the hearing of a case filed by S. Sekaran, who claimed to be a “press reporter” in his affidavit.

The case was filed seeking a police inquiry into inflated investigation figures allegedly submitted by former Inspector General of Police A.G. Ponn Manickavel in the High Court to get himself appointed as Special Officer of Idol Wing CID for a period of one year after his retirement. The retired IGP, in turn, questioned the credentials of the litigant.

Petitioner’s credentials

Directed to prove his credentials, the petitioner claimed that he was the editor of a Tamil fortnightly titled, ‘Manidha Manam’ for the last 10 years, besides being a freelance journalist contributing to other publications. His counsel submitted about six identity cards issued to him by the Department of Information and Public Relations in the past.

The bunch of identity cards produced by the counsel contained a seventh card, which turned out to be an identity card issued by the Police department to suspended Deputy Superintendent of Police Kadar Basha, who was prosecuted by Mr. Manickavel for having recovered precious artefacts from idol smugglers and sold them away for high prices.

“This raises suspicion with regard to the bona fide of the petitioner in approaching this court by filing this public interest litigation. Further, this court also suspects that the petitioner has filed the present writ petition at the instance of some third parties,” the judges said and directed the High Court Registry to keep all the identity cards in a sealed cover.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/k7wow0/article30546559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-suggests-setting-up-a-press-council-of-tamil-nadu/article30546560.ece

Bollywood actor and founder of Paani Foundation Aamir Khan presented the award to Collector A. Sri Devasena on the occasion. The district, under the leadership of Ms. Devasena, has bagged four national awards under the Swachh Bharat Mission.

It bagged the national award for scoring 100% on wide-ranging parameters of sanitation which include construction and maintenance of toilets, peoples participation, IEC and ODF+s and solid and liquid waste management interventions such as providing dumping yards, segregation of plastic waste, community, individual soak pits etc.

Cent per cent scores

The district achieved 100% coverage of all villages with community toilet blocks for men and women with running water overhead tank, tiled flooring, washbasins, paintings, signboards etc. It also recorded 100% coverage of soak pits to become the country’s first open-drain free district with salutary effect seen in 65% decline in dengue cases as compared to last year.

The district completely banned single-use plastic and promoted non-woven cloth bags provided by women SHGs and helped them secure employment. Peddapalli was acclaimed for the implementation of panchasutras (five-point programme) to achieve cent per cent sanitation in villages.

As per the panchasutras, each household should have soak pit, vermin compost pit, waste segregation at generating points by separating plastics, kitchen garden with leafy vegetables and use of sabala sanitary (biodegradable) napkins by women.

210,2020/01/12,Congress losing ground in Karimnagar,"Even as TRS and BJP are far ahead of others in electioneering for MCK, Congress is lagging behind in electioneering and also in finalisation of candidates to field from all the 60 municipal divisions.

The Congress, which was an undisputed party in the integrated Karimnagar district, is losing its sheen with the advent of TRS and formation of Telangana. Besides, the division of integrated Karimnagar into seven districts has dented the Congress vote bank.

Gone are the days when contestants used to compete for Congress party tickets for municipal elections. There was a time when more than five to 10 candidates competed for Congress ticket from each municipal division in Karimnagar town. Now, the party is literally in search of suitable candidates to be fielded from all the 60 municipal divisions in the town.

Congress received a rude shock with the resignation of DCC president K. Mruthyunjayam and Town Congress president Karra Rajashekhar on the eve of municipal elections. With no leader to guide the party, TPCC working president and former MP Ponnam Prabhakar is spearheading the party campaign. It had also suffered with former legislators K. Satyanarayana Goud and Arepalli Mohan and former MLC T. Santosh Kumar along with their cadre joining the TRS. Former Mayor D. Shankar had also shifted his loyalty to the BJP recently.

Congress is solely banking on TRS and BJP rebels for allocation of tickets. However, most of the TRS rebels, who were informed about non-allocation of tickets, shifted their loyalty to BJP and secured the party B form to file nominations.

Due to possibility of TRS rebels joining the BJP and Congress, the TRS district leadership decided not to issue B forms to any candidate in the town. The party has decided to submit B forms of the official party candidates after the completion of filing of nomination papers in bulk. This decision would prevent the TRS rebels from joining the Congress and BJP for the tickets, the sources said.

The TRS district leadership under the supervision of BC Welfare Minister Gangula Kamalakar is taking all measures to avoid rebel threat to candidates.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/en5iz9/article30552108.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-KRM-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-losing-ground-in-karimnagar/article30552109.ece

213,2020/01/12,Revanth says KTR is lying on funds for municipalities,"Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy has accused TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao of lying on the funds provided to corporations and municipalities, and wanted to know why the officials were coming up with repeated answers of ‘no funds’ when people go with representations.

At a press conference here, Mr. Revanth Reddy asked when KTR claims of giving ₹ 300 crore to Nizamabad, Ramagundam, Karimnagar and Khammam corporations why aren’t they developed. Poor infrastructure and shortage of minimum facilities like drinking water haunt these municipalities, he alleged.

Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao himself promised to turn Karimnagar into London but after six years all they see are dug up roads. In fact, villages that were merged into the corporation are burdened with taxes and are seeking demerger from the corporation, Mr. Reddy claimed.

Challenge to debate

Mr. Reddy challenged Mr. Taraka Rama Rao to come for a discussion on the municipalities and let the people decide on the outcome. Every election people are lured with new promises while the old ones are never cared for.

Even after six years the TRS claims that double bedroom houses are under construction while no municipality is receiving drinking water under Mission Bhagiratha. “We have warned about increase in RTC fares if the TRS wins in Huzurnagar byelections and it proved to be right,” he said.

KTR as CM

Mr. Reddy claimed that KTR’s declaration that elections were a referendum on his work was nothing but a reflection of the fight in the family over the Chief Minister’s seat. He alleged that pressure is being brought on KCR to leave the post in favour of his son and to escape the pressure KCR has linked it to the performance of the party in the municipal elections.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/revanth-says-ktr-is-lying-on-funds-for-municipalities/article30551514.ece
214,2020/01/12,Irrigation unit officers told to take court cases seriously,"The Irrigation Department has asked its unit officers/administrative heads — Engineers-in-Chief, Chief Engineers, Deputy CEs, Superintending Engineers and Executive Engineers — to act swiftly in filing affidavits, counter affidavits and clarifications on remarks to reduce pendency of cases pertaining to irrigation projects in courts and tribunals.

A communication to the effect has been sent to the unit officers in the first week of this month by Engineer-in-Chief (Administration) B. Nagendra Rao following a meeting convened by the Chief Justice of the High Court on December 28 last to discuss about the pending cases of various State government departments. The delay in filing counter affidavits, affidavits and giving clarification on remarks has been resulting not only in the courts passing remarks against the officials concerned by delaying the project works too.

“We have seen how the delay in filing affidavits and counter affidavits has resulted in the courts/tribunals making harsh observations and remarks against the officials concerned and passing orders against the government during the last couple of years, particularly in cases pertaining to Kaleshwaram, Palamuru-Rangareddy and a few other lift irrigation projects. Timely filing of information and clarifications would have avoided such remarks in several instances,” a senior engineer said unwilling to be quoted.

Poor follow up

Official sources in the Irrigation Department stated that a large number of cases pertaining to projects were still pending in courts due to delays on part of the administrative heads in filing the affidavits and clarifications. The Government Pleader for Irrigation Department had observed after the meeting held by Chief Justice that the officers responsible were not pursuing the pending cases properly and effectively in the High Court by not providing relevant information and documents in time.

Another complaint/observation from the Government Pleader and Assistant GP was that lower level staff was being deputed to attend court matters and they were unable provide the details required to make effective submission of information sought by the courts.

Responsible staff

To overcome such situations, the ENC asked the administrative heads to depute the engineers responsible along with the support staff to appraise facts to the Government Pleader to speed up the cases. Further, they have been told to “follow up with the GP/AGP to file affidavits and clarifications so as to file affidavits and clarifications in pending cases in time to avoid issuance of summons to higher officials (senior engineers) by courts”.

When asked about the number of pending cases, the officials did not give exact figure but stated that “it runs into hundreds”.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/b6ygj5/article30551477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY12MALLANNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/irrigation-unit-officers-told-to-take-court-cases-seriously/article30551478.ece

There was intense activity within the ruling party as MLAs were seen trying to convince aspirants who were out to file their nominations. However, such an activity was absent in Congress and BJP circles.

Winning municipal elections in the erstwhile Warangal district seems to be a cake walk for the ruling party. TRS not only appointed in-charges for each municipality, but the local leaders were summoned to Hyderabad and instructed to work in perfect coordination burying their differences.

217,2020/01/12,Shashidhar Reddy questions KCR’s silence on Pothireddypadu,"Questioning Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao’s silence on A.P. Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy’s proposal to double the water intake from Pothireddypadu head regulator, former minister M. Shashidhar Reddy said South Telangana will lose out if the proposals were allowed.

At a press conference here, Mr. Shashidhar Reddy asked Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao to raise the issue during his proposed meeting with Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy on Monday, and assure people of Telangana that no such effort would be allowed.

He reminded that he and late Congress leader P. Janardhan Reddy had fought against their own government in 20014 when the then CM Y.S. Rajashekar Reddy proposed to increase the water withdrawal from 11,000 cusecs to 40,000 cusecs. “We objected to the proposal as Telangana’s assured water would be adversely affected.”

He wanted to know the present status of Pothireddypadu regulator and how much water has been drawn ever since it was completed. He asked what does doubling the capacity mean as Mr. Jaganmohan Reddy has recently announced doubling the intake from 40,000 cusecs to 80,000 cusecs.

He said with existing capacity of 11,000 cusecs they should have increased by 33,000 cusecs but they added additional capacity of 44,000 cusecs making the total capacity to 55,000 cusecs.

Mr. Reddy said Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao should not allow this to happen as it was a question of Telangana’s interests and he should explain his stand to the people of Telangana.

The late YSR proposed increase of water withdrawl from Pothireddypadu citing the decrease in flood flow days from 90 to 30 due to the construction of Almatti and Narayanpur dams in Karnataka.

Though no foundation stone was laid, Mr. Rajasekhar Reddy had initially sanctioned ₹ 1,250 crore and the work was carried out on a war footing, Mr. Reddy recalled.

A letter from the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO), dated January 6, says the Chief Minister has responded positively to the request and had asked the Forest Department to initiate necessary action for beedi leaf or tendu leaf collection.

To prevent forest fires

The Kagaznagar Forest Division has become one of the most important tiger corridors in the country owing to the high number of tigers crossing over from neighbouring Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve and the forest of Alampalli in Chandrapur district of Maharashtra. According to an estimate, some 10 big cats are moving in the forest, which is likely to be confirmed by the ongoing tiger census, for whom the surroundings need to be made free of deadly occurrences like forest fires.

“We had planned to suspend beedi leaf collection so as to create a safer environment for the big cats as well as other wild animals,” said KB Asifabad District Forest Officer Laxman Ranjeet Naik. “We wanted to see how the animals fare in the absence of forest fires which generally occur in locations where tendu leaf collection takes place,” he explained his department reasoning.

Economics versus environment

The letter from the CMO reveals that the MLA had requested for keeping the beedi leaf collection activity going on in the interest of poor collectors. Those who collect tendu leaves make small earnings, especially in May.

The number of people who take part in beedi leaf collection in the six units each in Kagaznagar and Asifabad Forest Divisions, however, is too small to risk endangering the environment, according to conservationists. In Kagaznagar, 658 families or 4,882 individuals and in Asifabad 426 families or 2,528 individuals are involved in collection of the leaves.

Caveat to collectors and contractors

The letter in question also mentions Maharashtra-style operations to be implemented this side of the inter-State border. The Telangana State Beedi Leaves and Forest Contractors’ Association has also been pressing for this instead of banning the activity completely.

Among the conditions imposed on tendu leaf collectors and contractors is the responsibility to prevent kindling and spread of forest fires besides creating awareness about it. Contractors are also mandated to provide five fire watchers in each of the units to help the Forest Department. Further, they are liable to pay a fine upto ₹ 50,000 if more than 10 per cent of the unit area is damaged due to a fire.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ucsci/article30550873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13-BURNTTREE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/forest-department-proposes-telangana-cm-disposes/article30548746.ece

Random list

The students demanded revision of the ‘detained’ list, alleging that the head of department (HoD) had submitted it to officials of the Kaloji Narayan Rao University of Health Sciences, to which the college is affiliated, without issuing any notices to students and parents. As per rules, 75% attendance is compulsory to be eligible to appear for semester exams.

A 10% relaxation is given to students upon producing a medical certificate with prior intimation to the principal.Third year students of Kakatiya Medical College, who wished not to be identified, said the HoD unfairly detained the students by preparing a random list and forwarding it to university officials.

“According to rules, authorities need to display the attendance records on the college notice board two months before exams. They neither displayed nor informed parents while detaining students,” alleged a protesting student.

Meanwhile, members of the Junior Doctors’ Association submitted a representation to higher officials about the matter. Kakatiya Medical College officials were instructed to conduct a meeting with the HoDs and submit a report.

Following the directions, Kakatiya Medical College principal Sukaranemi Sandhya held a meeting with the HoDs and staff.

228,2020/01/12,3 SBI officials booked for kisan card fraud,"The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked three branch managers of the State Bank of India in Uttar Pradesh’s Lucknow for allegedly siphoning off funds from the exchequer by sanctioning Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans on forged documents. The agency has been pursuing multiple cases of KCC loan fraud involving hundreds of crores.

In its complaint, the State Bank of India identified the accused officials as Kamal Kumar Srivastava, Ansul Mendiratta and Awadhesh Srivastava, who were managers with its Kakori branch in Lucknow. They, along with the bank’s empanelled advocate Prakash Chandra Vidyarthi and one Gole Dwivedi, have been arraigned in the FIR.

An internal inquiry into the alleged irregularities in KCC accounts revealed that the officials had sanctioned and disbursed 96 loans under the scheme during 2014-17, totalling ₹6.60 crore.

A part of the funds was transferred to the account of Mr. Dwivedi, indicating diversion. The agency has now initiated investigations to determine the extent of the scam. It will also examine the role of several other suspects in the case.

Credit support

The KCC scheme, launched in 1998, is for providing credit support to farmers for their needs such as cultivation, post-harvest expenses, marketing of produce, maintenance of farm assets and allied activities. As per the 2019 data, there were 66.2 million operative KCC accounts.

Earlier, in March 2018, the CBI had registered three cases related to misappropriation of ₹743 crore through KCC and pisciculture loans from the IDBI Bank’s branches in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Among the 44 accused were two Deputy General Managers and an empanelled valuer.

Assets attached

Earlier this month, based on the CBI probe, the Enforcement Directorate attached assets worth ₹51 crore of a businessman and his family members. The accused had fraudulently availed himself of KCC loans to the tune of ₹69.46 crore in the name of 87 borrowers, who were his relatives, employees and acquaintances, by submitting his property papers. The funds were diverted and invested in properties.

In yet another case registered in October 2017, the CBI had accused some officials of the Bank of Baroda and the Madhya Pradesh government of fraud in disbursing loans to 139 farmers between 2013 and 2015. Four then managers of UCO Bank in Chhattisgarh had also come under the scanner for sanctioning loans on forged documents between 2011 and 2015.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3-sbi-officials-booked-for-kisan-card-fraud/article30551914.ece

Cabinet Ministers including Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa, Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria and Gurpreet Singh Kangar in a statement here said the SAD was in complete disarray, particularly in the post Prakash Singh Badal era, pointing to the rebellion by the Dhindsa father-son duo.

Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his son Parminder were suspended from SAD on Saturday after a core committee meeting.

“The Dhindsas had openly revolted against the stifling control of SAD by the Badals, declaring their intent to liberate the party from the family and revive its lost glory,” the Ministers pointed out, citing it as just the latest example of the mounting disillusionment within the party against Sukhbir Singh Badal’s leadership and the lack of democracy prevailing in it.

“If senior leaders of the party are so unhappy with the leadership and loss of ideology, one can only imagine how dissatisfied the ordinary workers would be,” they said.

“The Akali Dal had lost all credibility under the unprincipled and unethical leadership of the Badals, who had lost all political integrity and had cut off the party complete from the grassroots in order to promote their selfish personal interests,” they alleged.

‘Time to step down’

The Ministers stressed that it was time for the Badals to step down from the SAD and hand over the party reins to those who remain committed to the Akali ideology.

The National Liberation Front of Tripura (NLFT), an extremist group, has threatened to take punitive action against Lok Sabha member Rebati Tripura for supporting the CAA. Mr. Tripura is one of the two BJP MPs from the State. He is the sitting Lok Sabha MP for Tripura East, reserved for the tribal people.

A majority of 19 tribes in Tripura fear the CAA will bring more non-tribal people, especially Bengali-speaking Hindus, into the State. The tribal people are in a minority in the State.

“The NLFT has reportedly issued a threat letter. We are looking into the matter, and have ensured adequate security,” a Tripura police spokesperson said on Sunday.

236,2020/01/12,CAA stir: Inter-faith prayer to uphold values of Preamble as Shaheen Bagh protest nears month,"People of different faiths came together on Sunday to participate in a ‘sarva dharma sambhava’ ceremony at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, where anti-citizenship law protestors have been demonstrating for almost a month now.

The inter-faith ceremony, where there was a traditional Hindu-style ‘hawan’ and chants of Sikh ‘kirtan’, saw participants also reading out the Preamble of the Constitution and taking oath to preserve its “socialist, secular” values.

“Scriptures from the Geeta, the Bible, the Quran were read and Gurbani held. Then the Preamble of the Constitution was also read out by people from varying faiths who are supporting this movement, said Syed Taseer Ahmed, one of the initial organisers of the protest.

The crowd swelled from hundreds to over a thousand by afternoon. Being a Sunday and the weather relatively warmer, more people, could join the protest, he added.

The concept of ‘sarv dharm sambhav’ (equal respect for all religions or peaceful co-existance of all religions) was popularised by Mahatma Gandhi during India’s freedom struggle against the British rule to promote inter-faith harmony.

Hundreds of protestors, including women and children, stayed put at the Sarita Vihar-Kalindi Kunj road at Shaheen Bagh on Sunday, as their movement for withdrawal of the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and a proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC) was set to complete a month on Monday.

Zainul Abidin, 44, of Ghaffar Manzil had started a hunger strike on December 16 to press the demand for repealing the CAA and after a fortnight was joined by Mehrunissa, 40, of Sarita Vihar.

Besides them, three elderly women — now popular as the ‘Dabang Dadis’ of Shaheen Bagh — too have been a constant sight at the centre stage of the protest venue since day one.

A replica of the India Gate has also come near the protest site with names of the people who have lost their lives during anti-CAA protests across the country inked on it.

Over two dozen such names are written on the replica including those from states like Assam, Karnataka, Bihar and most of them from Uttar Pradesh.

People have been protesting at Shaheen Bagh and nearby Jamia Millia Islamia here to oppose the CAA and the NRC. Besides Delhi, protests have unfolded in several parts of the country over the contentious law since it was passed on December 11 and have led to clashes at several places including Uttar Pradesh, where nearly 20 people have died.

According to the amended law, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 and facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship. The law excludes Muslims.

Those opposing the law contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along withe the NRC is intended to target the Muslim community in India.

However, the central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted people from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away citizenship from anyone.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/du58lv/article30551270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAHEENBAGHPROTESTCAACAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-stir-inter-faith-prayer-to-uphold-values-of-preamble-as-shaheen-bagh-protest-nears-month/article30551271.ece

238,2020/01/12,J&K police officer may have been ferrying Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militants to Delhi,"The Jammu and Kashmir Police on January 12 said they are investigating the role of a gallantry award-winning senior police officer, Davinder Singh, who was ferrying two Hizbul Mujahideen militants, including wanted ‘commander’ Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Babu, in a civilian car on January 11.

They are suspected to have been headed to Delhi and may have been targeting the Republic Day function in the national capital.

“Based on an intelligence input provided by the Shopian police, two terrorists and one police officer were held during a search of a civilian car on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway on Saturday. The police officer will be treated as a terrorist. The ongoing operation started on Saturday (January 11). Multiple agencies are questioning them,” Inspector-General of Police, Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said.

Top police sources said the house of the arrested Deputy Superintendent of Police was also raided in Srinagar’s Indira Nagar and “one AK-47 and two pistols were recovered.”

Also Read Policeman, two Hizb militants held in Kashmir

In multiple raids conducted over 24 hours, two hideouts were busted and arms and ammunition were recovered by the security forces in south Kashmir, “but militants managed to escape”.

""The news of the arrest got leaked and allowed the militants to flee,"" said the IGP.

DSP Singh, awarded with 'Police Medal for Gallantry' in August 2018, was at present posted with the anti-hijacking wing of the police at the Srinagar International Airport. Sources said Mr. Singh was the officer in-charge who provided security and received a 15-member foreign envoys delegation on January 9 at the airport.

""Mr. Singh has applied for a four-day leave,"" the police officer said. Preliminary reports suggest the officer and the militants were headed to New Delhi, just two weeks ahead of the Republic Day function. The security agencies are probing likely target of the militants in the national capital.

The police officer, who worked with special anti-militancy squad Special Operations Group in 2002, faced a controversy when Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, in a letter, named him. Guru claimed Singh asked him to take another Parliament attacker Mohammad ""to Delhi and arrange him a flat for his stay and purchase a car for him"".

The DSP’s links with wanted militant Babu, is about to open a can of worms. The militant 'commander' was behind the killing of 11 truck divers, non-local labourers and apple traders in south Kashmir post August 5 to stop apple trade.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) named Babu behind a weapon snatching incident from a legislator's house in Srinagar on September 28, 2018 and has already arrested his accomplices in Delhi.

Babu, a resident of Shopian's Nazneenpora, joined the J&K police in 2012 as a constable and joined militant ranks after decamping with four rifles from a guard room of the Food Corporation of India Facility in Budgam's Chandpora in 2017.

240,2020/01/12,Central schemes: Modi takes a dig at Mamata; CM gives event a miss,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday took a dig at the Mamata Banerjee government on the “non-implementation of the Central government schemes” saying why schemes involving direct benefits — where there is no intermediary, cut money or syndicates are involved — not be implemented in the State.

“Under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, 8 crore farmers have benefited as about ₹43,000 crore have been transferred to their account through direct transfer. There is no intermediary, no cut money, no syndicate. When there is a direct transfer, no cut money is involved. Syndicate does not get anything. Why would someone try to implement such a scheme,” Mr. Modi asked.

Speaking at the event in Kolkata to mark the sesquicenentary celebrations of the Kolkata Port Trust ( KoPT), the Prime Minister said it pained him that the benefits of the Ayushman Bharat and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi were not reaching the people of the State.

“I pray to God that good sense prevails over the policy-makers of Bengal,” he said, adding that the people had made up their mind that nobody could deprive the poor of such benefits. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who was scheduled to participate in the KoPT event, gave the occasion a miss.

KoPT to be named Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Port

The Prime Minister also announced that the KoPT would be christened as Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust. He said Mookerjee had set up the foundation of industrialisation but his contributions were largely ignored. “The Kolkata Port will now be known as Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Port.” Mookerjee, founder of the Jana Sangh, had served as the Minister for Industry and Supply in Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s Cabinet.

Mr. Modi also emphasised on port-led development and said Kolkata assumes significance because it serves as the convergence of ports and inland waterways. He said work was in progress so that large ships could ply in the Ganga by 2021. He said the Centre was also promoting cruise tourism and wants to take the number of cruise ships from about 150 to 1,000.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9zf6nw/article30549810.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI-KESAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/central-schemes-modi-takes-a-dig-at-mamata-cm-gives-event-a-miss/article30549811.ece
241,2020/01/12,Tripura CM orders magisterial probe into 'custodial death',"Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb on Sunday ordered a magisterial probe into the death of an accused in custody in the west Tripura police station. Sushanta Ghosh (38), a resident of Lankamura locality in Agartala, was arrested on Saturday in connection with an ATM hacking investigation.

The Crime Branch (CB), which is probing the hacking crime that siphoned off nearly ₹1 crore of over 60 SBI customers in November last, picked up Ghosh on the basis of confession of four foreign nationals — two Turks and two Bangladeshis. The CB had recently got custody of the foreign hackers from the West Bengal police who arrested them in Kolkata based on specific inputs received from their Tripura and Assam counterparts.

The hackers had used a “skimmer device” to snoop on the ATM pin numbers and other technical details of the customers. They then stole money from the SBI ATM counters at Battala, Indra Nagar and Kaman Chowmuhani as well as a booth of the State co-operative at the post office Chowmuhani in Agartala city.

The hackers were identified from the CCTV footage in the ATM booths.

An officer of the west Agartala police station, who requested anonymity, said Ghosh was found hanging in the toilet attached to the lockup before dawn on Sunday. He was taken to a hospital where doctors declared him brought dead, he added.

The father of the deceased alleged that the police had tortured him to death and hanged his body to stage “suicide drama”. Senior police officers visited the police station.

The State Home department in a statement said the Chief Minister had ordered a magisterial inquiry into the death. It said the government had been strict on matters related to law and order.

Angry residents staged a protest in Lankamura locality against the death.

The terrorists - Umer Fayaz Lone alias “Hamad Khan” of Seer village, Faizan Hamid of Mandoora and Adil Bashir Mir alias “Abu Dujana” of Monghama - were wanted for their complicity in terror crimes, including attacks on security establishments and civilian atrocities, a police spokesman said.

He said the trio were affiliated with the proscribed Hizbul Mujahideen terror outfit and were trapped during a cordon-and-search operation jointly launched by police and security forces on a specific intelligence input in the Gujar Basti Gulshanpora area of Tral.

As the forces were conducting searches, the militants fired at them, triggering an encounter, resulting in their killing, the spokesman said.

According to police records, the spokesman said, Lone had a long history of terror crimes since 2016 and was involved in planning and executing several terror attacks in the area.

“He was part of groups responsible for carrying out a series of terror attacks and many other civilian atrocities besides killing of policeman Haleem Kohli of Gutroo Bangdar Tral and killing of civilian Mehraj Din Zarger of Tral,” he said, adding he was wanted in 16 cases registered at Tral police station and two cases at Awantipora police station.

Similarly, the spokesman said, Adil Bashir Mir and Faizan Hamid had a history of terror crimes and were also involved in carrying out several terror attacks in the area.

“They were also part of the group involved in the killing of civilian Mehraj Din Zarger near Tral Bus Stand and were responsible for several other terror crimes. Terror crime cases were registered against both of them including three cases at Tral Police Station.

Taking a dig at Mamata Banerjee government, he said the State government was not keen on implementing central schemes as it does not benefit “syndicates“.

Mr. Modi, after renaming the Kolkata Port Trust after Syama Prasad Mookerjee on the occasion of its sesquicentenary celebrations, said country’s coasts were gateways to development.

“Development of waterways has improved Kolkata Port Trust’s connectivity with industrial centres in east India, made trade easier for our neighbouring countries, Bhutan, Myanmar and Nepal.

“Our country’s coasts are gateways to development, the (central) government has started the Sagarmala programme to improve connectivity,” Mr. Modi said.

He stressed that the people of Bengal should get the benefits of all central schemes.

247,2020/01/12,Plan to set up separate varsity for Konkan: Minister,"Maharashtra Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant on Saturday said there were plans to set up a university in the Konkan region as it was a long-pending demand of the people there.

Currently colleges in Konkan’s Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts are affiliated to Mumbai University.

“There was a long pending demand of people from the Konkan that there should be a separate university in Konkan region. For students studying in Sawantwadi in Konkan, Mumbai University is almost 650 km away and it is difficult for them to travel that far for any work,” he said.

Addressing a press conference, he said a committee had been set up for the purpose.

When asked about varsity-level students’ polls, he said a segment was in favour while the other was not, adding that experts will be consulted by the State government to move ahead.

The previous BJP-led Maharashtra government had last year decided to revive students elections, which were banned since 1993, and fresh polls were supposed to be held in 11 universities and affiliated colleges.

However, they were kept in abeyance due to the October Assembly polls.

Mr. Samant said “principally” everybody in the present government was of the opinion that the (previous government’s) decision of students elections was not appropriate and should be changed.

He said a separate academy for professors will be set up in Pune.

Mr. Samant said the State government has decided to lift a stay on giving approvals to new libraries in the State.

“Since 2012, no permissions for new libraries have been given as there was a cabinet decision. We will lift the stay and start giving permissions for new libraries,” he added.

Asked about a Congress leader’s statement seeking cancellation of appointment of “pro-RSS vice chancellors”, Mr. Samant said it was not appropriate for him to comment as V-Cs are appointed done by the Governor.

He said focus would be on improving the quality of education, building infrastructure and increasing skills of teachers.

252,2020/01/12,JNU attack an act of ‘terrorist Leftist’ students: Ram Madhav,"BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav on Saturday alleged that the violence in Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) was an act of a small number of “terrorist Leftist students”, who have been hampering studies and research of thousands of students there for decades.

He called the January 5 violence in JNU as “conspiracy of Leftists and their supporters”.

“For decades, thousands of students have been tortured due to the terror of Leftists in JNU. The violence seen now is the culmination of the same thing. A few, small number of terrorist Leftist students have always been hampering the rights of thousands of students to study and conduct research in JNU,” Mr. Madhav alleged.

Masked people armed with rods and sticks had stormed the JNU campus on the night of January 5 and assaulted students and faculty, and vandalised property, leaving several people injured.

Leftist outfits and the RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) have blamed each other for the violence.

When questioned about the situation in Jammu & Kashmir, Mr. Madhav claimed normalcy was returning to the Union Territory, with internet being restored “to a great extent” and local leaders in detention being released.

He claimed that only “20-25” leaders are yet to be released and this would happen in a phased manner.

“People are living a normal life in Jammu & Kashmir. There were two major restrictions there, one being internet. To a great extent, mobile services have been restored. Most of the leaders under detention are out. And I believe government will release the remaining 20-25 leaders in phases,” he claimed.

He said there was no need to have a special discussion on J&K as it was not like “any other territory” in the country.

The BJP leader said that allowing foreign delegations in the restive region was part of an effort to remove “misunderstanding being spread” across the world about J&K.

“Everybody will be allowed to visit there as per the situation,” he said when asked about the opposition leaders not being allowed to visit the UT.

Praising the Narendra Modi government, Mr. Madhav claimed that “90% people” were supporting the decisions of the Centre, like removal of Article 370 in J&K, the Ram Mandir issue and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

He asserted that the CAA, which is at the centre of protests across the nation, was not discriminatory.

“Citizenship is not a separate Act. Everybody has the right to acquire citizenship after fulfilling certain requirements. An amendment has made it possible for particular sections to get citizenship at the earliest. But people are being misled by false propaganda,” he added.

“A few people who cannot take on Modiji politically are using terrorism and lies to create disturbance in the country,” Mr. Madhav said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a70d7u/article30548237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BMJNUSTUDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jnu-attack-an-act-of-terrorist-leftist-students-ram-madhav/article30548238.ece
253,2020/01/12,HC Chief Justice bats for dispute resolution through mediation,"Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog of the Bombay High Court on Saturday said the graph of dispute resolution through mediation was falling and efforts must be made to ensure that it rises.

Mr. Nandrajog was giving the inaugural address at a one-day conference on ‘Capacity building and evaluation of mediation activities’ in Amravati.

He said, “The graph of dispute resolution through mediation is going down. This graph needs to be taken up. If you look at claims and counter claims being made at the mediation table, you will find scope for giving something to both the parties. Mediators do not look into what is lying searchless in the kitty of the parties for distribution.”

Mr. Nandrajog also said the mediator “makes both parties enter a state of heteronomy in order to come out with a solution where both parties gain something”. He also asked judges to sport a smile on their faces while mediating as “a grim face sends a chill down the spines of the parties”.

The Chief Justice said courts, statutory tribunals, private tribunals (arbitrators), conciliation and mediation were the five horses that pull the chariot of justice. However, he said, mediation was not pulling well and there was “need to reflect and find causes as to what is going wrong”.

He said the traditional panchayat system in the post-World War II period catered to dispute resolution, but “we lost it all” due to the disintegration of communities. The mediator should be like the “lady of the house” who handles every situation with empathy, he said, adding that one must “empathise and sympathise with the cause, not with the parties”.

Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari, R.K. Deshpande, Z.A. Haq and S.B. Shukre were present at the conference, which was attended by 550 judges and lawyers from 11 districts of Vidarbha.

257,2020/01/12,CRPF transfers DIG accused of throwing hot water on jawan,"The Central Reserve Police Force has transferred a DIG-rank officer, who is accused of throwing hot water on a jawan who served it to him at a training centre, to the Manipur and Nagaland sector with immediate effect, officials said on Saturday.

Official sources said while the transfer has been done pending a detailed probe into the incident, the CRPF headquarters, in its order on Friday, extended “best wishes to the officer for a successful tenure in the new assignment”.

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) D.K. Tripathi, according to the order, has been transferred out to the Manipur and Nagaland sector from his current posting in Mokamaghat, Bihar.

The purported incident took place early this month at the CRPF recruit training centre in Bihar’s Rajgir district. The jawan, constable Amol Kharat, is reported to have suffered scalding injuries to his face and chest.

Officials said the DIG has been transferred after a preliminary inquiry report into the incident was submitted by an Inspector General-rank officer. A full investigation into the incident is under way. The contents of the preliminary inquiry report were not immediately known but officials said a recommendation for a detail and full probe was made.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/crpf-transfers-dig-accused-of-throwing-hot-water-on-jawan/article30547721.ece
258,2020/01/12,"Odisha seeks simultaneous SECC, general census","The Odisha government on Saturday demanded that the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) be conducted simultaneously with the general census in 2021.

The State Cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik here resolved to move the Centre with the plea to conduct a socio-economic caste enumeration along with the general census, either by inserting suitable columns in the census format or by prescribing a separate format.

It also resolved to impress upon the Central government to ensure that the enumeration details are published without any delay, said Pratap Jena, State Panchayati Raj and Law Minister, after the Cabinet meeting here on Saturday.

“This will enable the State government to accelerate the pace of development of these communities leading to inclusive growth with greater momentum. As we are commemorating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, this will be a fitting tribute to his idea of India guided by his talisman in which the welfare of the poorest and the weakest becomes the core objective of the State,” said Mr. Jena reading out the resolution.

The Cabinet observed that no formal census, including the caste details of the population, has been done since 1931.

Unreliable data

“Unavailability of reliable and authentic data about the exact numbers of socially and educationally backward classes and other backward classes/castes, geographical areas of their spread and density has been a huge challenge in ensuring focused and outcome-specific planning,” read the resolution.

The necessity of having such data was well appreciated by the Central government as evident from the Socio-Economic Caste Census of 2011, it said.

The State Cabinet also took note of the fact that in the proposed formats for 2021 census, there is no provision to capture the details of socially and educationally backward classes and other backward classes/castes despite having done such exercise in the SECC-2011, the full data of which is yet to be released.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wh3s36/article30547616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DEPATNAIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-seeks-simultaneous-secc-general-census/article30547617.ece
259,2020/01/12,"New party a necessity in Assam, says Gogoi","Senior Congress leader Tarun Gogoi on Saturday said that a new political party has become a necessity in Assam to oust the ruling BJP in the State.

All parties must ensure the defeat of the BJP as instead of addressing the people’s demand for scrapping the Citizenship Amendment Act it has engaged in a show of strength by organising peace rallies, he said.

Hitting out at the BJP-led government at the Centre, the three-time Chief Minister said it has brought the entire country out on the streets to protest against the CAA and caused misery to the general public. The peace rallies by the BJP are an admission by the saffron party that under its rule peace in the State has been affected, Mr. Gogoi said, adding that the people had trusted Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal but he has become a “puppet” of the Centre.

“In his greed for power, Mr. Sonowal has back stabbed the people of the State... The downfall of the BJP government in Assam has started and if he wants to survive, Mr. Sonowal must take steps to withdraw the citizenship law and protect the indigenous people of Assam,” he added.

“A new political party has become a necessity. We (Congress) are not selfishly looking after our own interests as a new political party might inflict some damage on our party as well. But we are trying to protect the interests of Assam,” he said.

“The BJP must go from power and all parties must ensure its defeat at the polls... Only if BJP is defeated in the State can we ensure that CAA is not implemented in the State,” he added.

Gogoi had earlier too called for all sections of the people to come together and had spoken of forming a new party if the need for it is felt to oust BJP from power.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mn19a/article30547612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DEGOGOI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/new-party-a-necessity-in-assam-says-gogoi/article30547613.ece
260,2020/01/12,"48 BJP minority cell workers in Bhopal quit over CAA, NRC","“Have you ever seen a government passing a law in Parliament, and then going from door to door seeking support for it?” said Adil Khan, who quit the BJP as its Bhopal district minority cell vice-president on Saturday over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens. “This shows the party is aware it has committed a wrong,” he added.

As many as 48 members of the cell in Bhopal district, including the State media in-charge, spokesperson and district ministers, quit the party, stating senior leadership refused to heed complaints of offensive remarks made by some leaders against a community and kept them away from its door-to-door campaign on the contentious law.

“The Act and the NRC is a lethal combination. Only we know how we went to each Muslim home during elections to canvass for votes. Yet we have to take a stand now,” said Mr. Khan. “People don’t have enough to eat, how can you expect them to produce documents to prove citizenship?”

In a letter addressed to the State minority cell chief, the former members wrote, “The party once followed principles of Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Atal Bihari Vajpayee, didn’t indulge in discrimination and took everyone along, including minorities. But in the past few years, it has been hijacked by two-three big names and started working against a particular community... The spirit of the Constitution is being killed now.”

‘No democracy in party’

Stating there was no democracy left in the party, its former cell media chief Javed Baig said, “I thought you could keep your view points and discuss them in the party. We thought they’ll call us to resolve our issues. But even the State party president didn’t respond.”

Having spent 40 years in the party, Abdul Qureshi, 65, said the party’s policy of creating a Hindu rashtra had come out in the open. “Back then, at least they used to hear us out. Now, the party has lost its ideology.”

The BJP rejected the claims of the former members of its minority cell and said they had been misled. “Community leaders and communists who work against the interest of the country have misled our workers, who don’t understand the issue properly,” Leader of the Opposition and BJP leader Gopal Bhargava told The Hindu.

Denying the allegation that minority leaders were not being involved in awareness drives, he said, “Several of them [minority leaders] were with me during the [CAA awareness] drive in Agar Malwa district. They were happy with the law and said since the Prime Minister had given ₹2.5 lakh per house under the [Pradhan Mantri] Awas Yojana, how could they be thrown out [of the country]?”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/48-bjp-minority-cell-workers-in-bhopal-quit-over-caa-nrc/article30546723.ece
261,2020/01/12,"They studied, they conquered... and now they wait for jobs","Whenever neighbours jeered Huma Akhtar, 28, about her persistent, never-ending pursuit for studies, she retorted: “It is the only sure way to get a job.” She didn’t stop at securing the 3rd university rank at MSc in mathematics, but aced the State Eligibility Test, grabbed SRF scholarship, and is in the last leg of a PhD. Yet her faith in academics seems to be wavering.

Clearing a government examination with a State rank of 58 would be enough to land the dream job of assistant professor, she thought, but the excruciating delay in the appointment of 91 candidates — meritorious women from backward communities — is slowly killing dreams, including hers.

“Was it our fault that we studied well and secured top ranks?” she asks. Left with just another year of ₹35,000 a month as scholarship, Ms. Akhtar, an OBC, supports a family of four in Bhopal — father who left work three years ago, an ageing mother, sister engaged in making bridal mehendi and a brother continuously switching jobs.

The 91 women — 70 from the OBCs, 18 from the SCs and three from the STs — who performed so well that they were adjusted in the unreserved category as per convention, faced the wrath of unselected general category candidates who moved the court claiming infringement of rights. Initially, the High Court ordered a stay on the adjustment, but a month later in October directed the State government to restore them to original categories, and allow them to pick colleges of their choice, thereby beginning the process.

The first rankers in geography and English, and 11 candidates in the top 15 across categories and genders all come from the meritorious lot. “I gave up an opportunity at the Defence Research and Development Organisation just to prepare for the exam,” says Sanskriti Damade from Bhopal, who secured the 2nd rank in psychology, is a university topper, cleared the National Eligibility Test and is pursuing a PhD. “Yet those behind us in the merit list have joined work, and we’re left on the streets to protest.”

Meanwhile, 2,600 other candidates, selected through the examination conducted by the Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission two years ago, joined duty on December 6. “Is this natural justice?”asks Kirti Patel, from Barwani district, who secured 52nd rank in law. “Capable women, that too from backward communities, are being held back from rising in society.”

In October, the court had directed the State government and the MPPSC to extend the date of choice filling by seven days, after candidates were restored to their original categories.

“Their seats have been blocked and no appointments have been made on them. The government is cautious about the legality of the matter,” D.P. Ahuja, Higher Education Commissioner, told The Hindu. Yet, he clarified, “Candidates were given the leverage of only choice filling according to the direction. Their appointment shall be kept in abeyance until a final clarification or order is issued by the court.”

At the next hearing on Monday, the State government would inform the court in case of no objection, it was ready to appoint the women. “The petitioners in the case are general category women seeking reservation in the unreserved category,” he said.

They were in the merit anyway, in the unreserved category or the reserved one, he added. “In case they are restored to their original categories, the 91 at the bottom of the merit will be moved to the waiting list,” said Mr. Ahuja.

Ms. Damade said the other candidates appointed in 2019 would have an edge in increments. “At least for 10-15 years, seniority will depend on marks and not experience,” clarified Mr. Ahuja.

The government had exhorted guest faculty members, demanding regularisation through back door entry, to seek it through the examination, for which they enjoy age relaxation and extra 20 marks for a maximum of five years of experience. More than half of the 91 women have been guest faculty members.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ufnavk/article30546707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12BANNER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/they-studied-they-conquered-and-now-they-wait-for-jobs/article30546708.ece

The decision was taken at a meeting of the core committee which was presided over by party president Sukhbir Singh Badal.

The party has decided to suspend them with immediate effect and has also resolved to issue them a charge sheet to explain their conduct.

According to party spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema, after due discussion it was decided to issue a charge sheet to the duo, following which they would be given two weeks to explain their conduct. “The party will take its next course of action after receiving the reply of the two leaders,” he said.

Former Minister Sikander Singh Maluka, who is party’s observer for Sangrur district, disclosed to the core committee that at a recent meeting of the Sangrur district body it was unanimously decided to recommend the expulsion of both Mr. Sukhdev Dhindsa and Mr. Parminder Dhindsa for indulging in anti-party activities.

State Science & Technology Secretary Mugdha Sinha said here on Saturday that the two institutions would help promote interdisciplinary fields such as bio-informatics, biomedical engineering and nanomedicine. “We also expect to support the Nirogi Rajasthan campaign launched recently in the health sector by strengthening it through bio-informatics,” said Ms. Sinha.

She added that the Centre’s help would be sought for evolving startup ecosystem in various spheres of biotechnology after the signing of the MoU.

266,2020/01/12,"AMU V-C seeks security for himself, family","With Aligarh Muslim University set to reopen on Monday, Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor has sought security for himself and his family from the district administration.

In a letter addressed to the Aligarh Senior Superintendent of Police, Prof. Mansoor said some ‘antisocial and lumpen elements’ were threatening him and trying to vitiate the peaceful atmosphere of the university in reference to the ongoing agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.

“They are putting posts on social media which are aimed at instigating a violent reaction against me,” he said. A few days ago, he said, posters were put at various places asking for his social boycott. “An FIR has been lodged by the Proctor,” the letter said.

He said as the university opens on Monday, these elements could try to create law and order issues and might also harm him and his family by labelling him as a member of the RSS/ BJP and a supporter of the CAA. He also attached copies of social media posts which have a threatening tone, and underlined the one which allegedly said that funeral of the Vice-Chancellor will be taken out on reopening of the university.

‘Already booked’

SSP Akash Kulhary said extra security would be provided to the V-C and the Registrar. “I have asked SP (Crime) and CO (Civil Lines) to submit a report. It seems these antisocial elements include those rusticated students who have already been booked under the goonda Act (The U.P. Control of Goondas Act, 1970). We are also doing a security audit of the university to develop an internal mechanism by which better security could be provided within the campus. On Monday, security forces will remain present at the administrative block, the Registrar office and the V-C Lodge,” he said.

Salman Imtiaz, president, AMU Students’ Union (2018-19), described the V-C’s claim as “hoax and ridiculous”.

“Prof. Mansoor has no threat from AMU students who have been peacefully protesting against CAA-NRC,” he said.

‘Intimidating students’

After a month-long undeclared sine die, alleged Mr. Imtiaz, Prof. Mansoor, instead of welcoming the students, was creating an environment for further violence against students. “Since AMU students are still protesting against the CAA-NRC-NPR, his statement is an attempt to intimidate students,” he claimed.

AMU spokesperson Shafey Kidwai said the university administration would ensure no bona fide student is harassed and would try to get the FIR quashed against innocent students.

“The university has no issue if the students protest peacefully against any provision they find objectionable and is committed to providing a congenial and secure atmosphere to them,” said Prof. Kidwai, underlining that no student was named in the letter.

Najmul Islam, honorary secretary of AMU Teachers’ Association, said he would seek an appointment with the V-C. “The AMUTA has decided to continue with its peaceful protest and satyagraha against the CAA-NRC-NPR.”

On Saturday, the AMUTA released a schedule of march/satyagraha, starting Monday.

Aligarh BJP MP Satish Gautam has reacted to the developments. In a letter written to the V-C, he criticised the university administration for not being able to handle a “handful of antisocial elements on the campus”.

The Mumbai opener was rested for the T20I series against Sri Lanka which the hosts won 2-0.

The release added that Vijay Shankar has been included in the India-A squad for the New Zealand tour since Hardik Pandya’s rehabilitation process is taking longer than expected.

T20 Squad for tour of New Zealand:

Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma (vice-captain), KL Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (wk), Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Manish Pandey, Shivam Dube, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini, Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Shami.

PTI adds:

The five-match T20 series against New Zealand will begin on January 24 in Auckland.

The selection committee under outgoing chairman MSK Prasad kept the ODI and Test squads on hold for the time being.

“There are no surprises in the Indian T20 squad with Rohit as usual coming back in place of Sanju, who is already in New Zealand with the A team. All the other players picked themselves,” a senior BCCI official privy to selection matters told PTI on the condition of anonymity.

Interestingly, the Test and the ODI squads were not announced and it is believed that Hardik Pandya’s latest fitness drama could be the reason.

Vijay Shankar had replaced Pandya in the India A squad for New Zealand shadow tour.

“Hardik Pandya was boarding the flight to New Zealand for A team without playing a Ranji match. If we go by media reports, his trainer has said that there are workload issues with regards to his bowling. That itself implies that he is not fit.

270,2020/01/12,Karsan Ghavri — the pacer who spun out a five-for,"Karsan Ghavri played in an era when spinners were the backbone of the Indian team.

Oftentimes, in the 1970s, Ghavri was employed as the sole pacer in the playing eleven. But Ghavri, a nippy left-arm seamer, was a handy spinner himself.

Bolt from the blue

This quality came to the fore in the fifth Test against England at the Wankhede in 1977.

In the England second innings, the Indian spinners — captain Bishan Singh Bedi, B.S. Chandrasekhar and E.A.S. Prasanna — were struggling. This gave Ghavri the chance to try a bit of left-arm spin — a move that worked wonders.

I could not bowl spin often for India, because we had great spinners like Bedi, Chandrasekhar, Prasanna and Venkatraghavan

Much to Bedi’s surprise, Ghavri picked up five wickets, including that of Tony Greig, Derek Randall and Alan Knott. The match ended in a draw, but Ghavri had made his mark as a man of dual talent.

“I was a spinner in school. One day, when I was in school, our captain was injured and could not play a tournament final. My coach asked me to run in from 10-12 yards and bowl with the new ball. In around six overs, I had taken five wickets.

“The coach suggested I should concentrate on fast bowling. I agreed, and years later, got picked for the Ranji Trophy and for India as a fast bowler,” Ghavri, now the Saurashtra coach, said on the sidelines of his side’s Ranji match against Karnataka here on Sunday.

“Against England at the Wankhede, Bishen must have bowled 15-20 overs, but was unlucky not to get wickets. He went off for a rub, and asked Sunil Gavaskar to lead. Sunil gave me the ball and asked me to bowl spin.

“I bowled eight or nine overs and picked up five wickets,” Ghavri said.

“When Bishan was ready to come back onto the field, he saw that the England team had suffered a collapse. He asked the manager, ‘How did this happen? Did we take the new ball?’.

“The manager replied, No. It's the old ball. Karsan bowled spin and took a fifer’. Bedi was surprised,” Ghavri recalled.

Overshadowed

Bedi had a quick chat with Ghavri in the dressing room. “Bedi told me not to bowl spin, not even in the nets. I said, ‘Paaji why? I took five wickets'. Bishen replied, 'If you take five wickets as a left-arm spinner, then of what use am I?’.

271,2020/01/12,Ranji Trophy | Kerala fails to capitalise on Nidheesh’s efforts,"An inept batting display by Kerala batsmen saw it tottering at 88 for five at stumps on the second day of the Ranji Trophy Group A match against Punjab at the KCA-St. Xavier's College ground on Sunday. This, after a remarkable bowling effort (seven for 88) by M.D. Nidheesh had given the hosts a narrow nine-run lead.

Kerala leads by 97 runs but will need more to make a match out this. Credit should go to Punjab spinners — especially Gurkeerat Maan, who scalped four for 27 — for keeping their side very much alive in the contest.

Gurkeerat teased and tormented the Kerala batsmen with flight and turn, and he was well supported by Vinay Choudhary — to the extent that Mayank Markande’s leg spin wasn’t needed at all.

Failed experiment

Kerala tinkered with its batting line-up, sending in a horde of left handers to neutralise the threat of Gurkeerat's off spin. The experiment to open with Robin Uthappa failed, as the batsman fell off the first ball to push the hosts on the backfoot.

Akshay Chandran and Rohan Prem figured in a 55-run stand for the second wicket, but Gurkeerat's late strikes gave Punjab the upperhand.

Earlier, it was a lion-hearted effort from Nidheesh, who finished with career-best figures that gave Kerala a narrow lead.

Playing his first match this season, Nidheesh troubled the batsmen with pace and movement to take his second five-wicket haul in Ranji Trophy.

Ominous start

The day started ominously for Punjab as Jalaj Saxena sent back night watchman Markande off the fourth ball of the day.

Gurkeerat played aggressively, but Nidheesh had him (37) mistiming a lofted shot and caught by Sachin Baby in the covers. In the same over, Nidheesh snared Anmolpreet Singh, who was snapped up by Salman Nizar for a duck as Punjab slid to 71 for five.

As the Punjab innings disintegrated before him, captain Mandeep Singh (71 not out) showed good temperament to counter the Kerala attack. The 47-run ninth-wicket stand with Siddharth Kaul (25) was crucial, and whittled down Kerala's lead to a single digit.

The scores:

Kerala — 1st innings: 227.

Punjab — 1st innings: Rohan Marwaha b Nidheesh 16, Sanvir Singh c Robin b Nidheesh 1, Gurkeerat Mann c Baby b Nidheesh 37, Mayank Markande c Akshay b Jalaj 14, Mandeep Singh not out 71, Anmolpreet Singh c Salman b Nidheesh 0, Abhishek Sharma c Azharuddeen b Nidheesh 17, Anmol Malhotra lbw Nidheesh 21, Vinay Choudhary lbw Nidheesh 0, Siddharth Kaul run out 25, Baltej Singh st Azharuddeen b Sijomon 2; Extras (nb-2, b-3,1b-9): 4; Total (in 65.4 overs): 218.

272,2020/01/12,"Toughest test, says Richardson","Australian pacer Kane Richardson, who was a part of the World Cup squad last year, is hoping to get game-time in what he referred to as the toughest test for a bowler in white-ball cricket.

“It’s the biggest challenge in white-ball cricket, coming over here and playing against India on the surfaces over here. It’s a lot different than Australia. The ground sizes are a lot smaller than Australia, mis-hits can often go for six,” Richardson said.

“It’s something we have spoken a lot about. I think everyone in the team has played here before, so it’s nothing new. Starting today we will figure out a plan to stop some of those guys. It will be a high-scoring contest I’m sure.”

He also talked about the issue with Marcus Stoinis during the Big Bash League recently where the latter was fined AUD 7,500 for a “homophobic slur” against Richardson. Richardson said they had buried the spat. “Yeah, a little WhatsApp the morning after, but not a whole lot of conversation about it. He realised he made a mistake,” Richardson said ahead of Australia’s training at the Wankhede Stadium here on Sunday.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/y3xfec/article30551029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KaneRichardson,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/toughest-test-says-richardson/article30550954.ece
273,2020/01/12,"Never thought things will happen so fast, says teenager Richa","Richa Ghosh is still soaking it all in. When most girls of her age will be preparing for their board exams in February, the 16-year-old Siliguri girl will be preparing for her maiden international cricket tour with the Indian women’s side and that too the ICC World T20.

The teenager picked up the willow seeing her father Manabendra Ghosh, now a part-time Bengal umpire, at a tender age of four and half years and after a good show in the Challenger Trophy has made her way into the national team.

“I never thought that this will happen so fast. It’s hard to believe and the feeling hasn’t sunk in yet,” Richa told PTI on her way back to Kolkata.

“My first role model has always been my dad from whom I learnt cricket. Then it was Sachin Tendulkar, who will always remain my idol.”

But when it’s about her six-hitting skill, it’s none other than MS Dhoni.

“I love the way he hits sixes and try the same. Whoever maybe the bowler, when you have the bat, you can do anything.

In the Bengal team, Richa has been backed by none other than Jhulan Goswami and she always exchanged notes with India wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, who incidentally hails from her hometown Siliguri.

“Jhulan di always supported me in the team while I always got help from Wriddhi da. He remains busy but we speak on and off. I’m really grateful to them and to my coaches, the Cricket Association of Bengal for supporting me.”

Spotting her seriousness for the game, her father had enrolled her at the local Bagha Jatin Club — then the only girl in the club, but she played fearlessly and made rapid strides and was called for senior Bengal camp in 2012-13.

“Everything happened so fast that it’s difficult to realise. We are all shocked but it’s like a pleasant one,” the awestruck father said.

“But we all had always felt she was different from others. When we all played cricket for fun, she was always serious when she had the bat with her,” Ghosh said about Richa, a die-hard Sachin Tendulkar fan.

Known for her six-hitting exploits, the 16-year-old from Siliguri is a complete package — someone who loves to open the batting, bowls quick and also keeps wickets.

“She’s a coach’s delight, a God-gifted talent. But she’s is very young and we have to ensure that she goes a long way,” Bengal women’s team coach Shib Shankar Paul said.

Bengal trainer and wickekeeping coach Rahul Deb said she easily clears the boundaries and her fielding is top notch.

“She’s a natural talent and a ready to don any role for the team, be it batting, bowling, wicketkeeping or her accurate and powerful throws from the deep. Going forward, she just needs to train on her fitness,” Deb said.

So, when the news trickled in that Richa was picked after her eye-catching performances in the for the Smriti Mandhana-led India ‘B’ side in the just-concluded domestic Challengers Trophy, Richa was in the ongoing Bengal camp in Mankundu, about 45 kilometres from here.

The Bengal camp celebrated her selection with a cake-cutting ceremony.

The Cricket Association of Bengal joint secretary Avishek Dalmiya also wished her success.

“It’s a fabulous news. She is really talented and have been performing very well in domestic cricket. She is a hard-hitter and is one of the few women cricketers, who can clear the boundaries of full size cricket grounds with ease.

“A true all-rounder in every sense, Richa is an asset for any team as she can bat, bowl and keep wickets depending on the requirement of team. We are confident that she would excel in the global event. Our best wishes are with her,” Dalmiya said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/g5cruj/article30550812.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RichaGhosh,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/never-thought-things-will-happen-so-fast-says-teenager-richa/article30550813.ece
274,2020/01/12,TN coach unhappy with the pitch,"After another gruelling day on the field for Tamil Nadu, coach D. Vasu was disappointed with his bowlers’ efforts in the first innings on Sunday.

Speaking to reporters after the second day’s play, Vasu said, “We didn’t bowl well and the wicket was damp and slow. Bowlers themselves have admitted that. As long as they learn from this, I am fine with that.”

The coach was also critical about the nature of the wicket at Chepauk saying it was not conducive for forcing a result. “It looks like a dead wicket. It may turn on the third day but these kinds of wickets prepared by the curator, I am extremely unhappy. It’s a new wicket, we don’t get the home advantage that we deserve. I mean, we need to have good wickets, not a green top or a turner but there should be something for the bowlers and that’s what makes good cricket.”

Dinesh Karthik went off the field holding his back before lunch. The coach gave updates saying, “He had taken rest, he should be fine by tomorrow.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tn-coach-unhappy-with-the-pitch/article30550774.ece
275,2020/01/12,Tare happy to lead from the front,"Mumbai skipper Aditya Tare was a relieved man after making his first significant score of this year’s Ranji Trophy season.

Tare said, “I was given the responsibility of leading the side. The best I can do is to lead from the front and when the captain is performing, it rubs off on the team. I am glad that I could get a big score in this match. We had a lot of young players in the team. Either me or (Siddhesh) Lad had to play that big innings. Unfortunately, Lad got out early. I had to put my hand up and stick in there. I just wanted to stay calm at the crease because when you are not doing well, you become tight and expect a lot out of yourself and put added pressure on yourself. Just play one ball at a time.”

Looking at the next two days, Tare said, “Pitch has eased out a little but there are footmarks, cracks and the ball is keeping low. We were extremely tight, our fast bowlers bowled very well. Another 180 overs, two more days to go. If we get early wickets then we can put pressure on them.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tare-happy-to-lead-from-the-front/article30550751.ece
276,2020/01/12,Ranji Trophy 2019-20 | Tare comes to party finally,"Before the match against Tamil Nadu, Mumbai skipper Aditya Tare was in woeful form with just 55 runs from six Ranji Trophy innings. If not for the absence of some big players, Tare might have well been dropped for this match and would have needed a big innings to justify his place. By the end of the second day’s play here at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium, Tare trebled his season’s tally with a brilliant 154 (253b, 19x4, 2x6) to take Mumbai to a 488 in the first innings. In reply, TN finished on 66 for no loss with Abhinav Mukund batting on 52.

Resuming on 284/6, Mumbai lost an early wicket when T. Natarajan had Vinayak Bhoir caught at short-leg. But Tare, who started the day on 69, continued from where he left off and struck a crucial 123-run stand with Shashank Attarde for the eighth wicket.

Boundaries galore

Tare started with two boundaries off Natarajan before picking two more off Ashwin through the offside as he got to his ninth First Class ton.

The skipper then went after the spinners, hitting Aparajith for two sixes straight down the ground in one over and swept Sai Kishore convincingly for a few boundaries.

TN’s bowlers — including the spinners — once again looked lacklustre and never really threatened the batsmen. They soon resorted to some very defensive bowling.

Second fiddle

Attarde, meanwhile, played second fiddle to his skipper without taking many risks and capitalised on a spread-out field as Mumbai went to lunch on 397/7.

After lunch, Tare found two boundaries off Natarajan, the second a beautiful cover drive to take him to 152, before he was dismissed by the same bowler caught at slip with Aparajith taking a diving catch.

Attarde, and later Tushar Desphande, then stepped up the scoring with the former scoring a half-century. Deshpande was severe on Ashwin hitting him for three sixes in his unbeaten 39.

Glorious shots

For the host — which had sedate start with 17 runs off 13 overs — Abhinav played some glorious shots against the spinners. He quickly moved to his half-century with seven boundaries and TN would hope he gets a big one to help save the match.

277,2020/01/12,"BCCI set to appoint Madan Lal, Gautam Gambhir as CAC members","The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has approached World Cup winners Madan Lal and Gautam Gambhir, the former India cricketers, to be a part of the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC). Both the former Delhi giants confirmed to The Hindu that they are willing to be a part of CAC.

While Madan Lal, the 1983 World Cup winner who also served as India coach in the 1990s, said he is “willing to contribute to Indian cricket in every possible way”, Gambhir said he has given his consent to the BCCI.

The CAC’s formation has been delayed since the new BCCI dispensation headed by Sourav Ganguly has made a plea to the Supreme Court seeking relaxation in the Conflict of Interest clause. Considering that the apex court may hear the case on January 14, the BCCI has swung into action.

If the Supreme Court gives its nod, the BCCI will reconstitute the CAC at the earliest so that in can set in place the procedure to appoint revised selection committees. The first CAC appointed in 2015 included Sachin Tendulkar, V.V.S. Laxman and Ganguly.

After the conflict clause came into place, all the three backed out.

278,2020/01/12,Buttler questions use of stump microphones,"England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler has apologised for his foul-mouthed verbal volley in the second test against South Africa, but questioned whether television viewers should have access to the audio from stump microphones.

Buttler was fined 15% of his match fee and handed one demerit point after swearing repeatedly at South Africa all-rounder Vernon Philander late on the final day as England sought the wickets that would take them to a 189-run win.

“I fully understand that as role models we have a duty to behave in a certain way. I would like to apologise and understand that is not the way to behave. I take the slap on the wrist,” Buttler told reporters on Sunday.

“It was the heat of the moment and a bit of red mist. But it is all done and can now be swept under the carpet so we can move on.”

Asked whether he felt the audio from the stump microphones should be available to the public, Buttler said most players were against it.

“In test cricket there is high emotion at times. There can be things said that dont mean anything, but for the viewers at home it can come across very poorly,” he said.

“It is a tough one, we understand that it adds to the viewer experience to have stump mics to hear a bit of what goes on.

“But I think the players like the thinking of what happens on the field, stays on the field, and isnt heard necessarily by everyone at home.”

Buttler felt England created energy around the bat in Cape Town with their attempts to unsettle the home batsmen.

“It is easy to say vocal is the way to do things, but also your actions speak loud as well. One of the good things in that last game was the way we hunted as a team,” he said.

“We have a number of young guys under the age of 24 in the side and they were fantastic at creating energy around the bat and putting pressure on the opposition.

“The two games have been played in a great spirit, they have been hard-fought and the series is set up really well at 1-1.”

279,2020/01/12,"A good dilemma to have, says Vikram Rathour","When Shikhar Dhawan injured his knee during the Syed Muhstaq Ali Trophy, K.L. Rahul got a longer run at the top of the order during India’s white-ball matches at home over the last couple of months.

Despite having proved his mettle, come Tuesday, Rahul may still have to be benched for the first of the three ODIs versus Australia.

With Dhawan and Rahul coming good against Sri Lanka in last week’s T20 series, it will be a toss-up between the two for the series-opener at the Wankhede Stadium.

Coach happy

Batting coach Vikram Rathour was happy for the team management to be facing a “good dilemma” but stressed that only one of them would start the series.

“It’s a good dilemma to have. Rohit is an obvious choice, of course. Both of them — Shikhar and Rahul — are playing well. Shikhar has done well in one-dayers, Rahul is in great form, so we’ll deal with it when we have to. There are still a couple of days to go.

“The management will sit down and make a choice. I don’t see it as an issue, one of them will have to sit out,” Rathour said on Sunday.

Over the last year, the team management has tried to accommodate the triumvirate in ODIs. In last year’s World Cup in England, Rahul started off at No. 4 with Kohli separating him and the openers before suffering an injury.

However, when Dhawan was sidelined, Rahul grabbed the opportunity to open the innings in ODIs.

Rahul complemented Rohit to perfection, garnering 185 runs at 61.67 and a strike rate of 89, including a hundred and a fifty in three ODIs against Kieron Pollard’s men.

Rathour, however, stressed the team management would avoid experimenting at the start of the ODI series like it did in the recent T20 contests.

“We did that in T20s, because we were willing to give them some game time. But, against Australia, in the first game, we’ll start with our best XI. And I think everyone will bat according to the order that has been tried out. As the series goes on, we’ll see if we can experiment,” he said.

Optional nets

Interestingly, Rohit and Rahul were among the six Indians to participate in the optional nets at the Wankhede on Sunday.

Rohit even got an injury scare, with a throwdown by Rathour hitting his thumb. But the vice-captain returned for another hit in no time and didn’t look in any discomfort.

With the three openers at their best, the team management will surely have its task cut out while finalising the team for the opener on Tuesday.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/f5jmv5/article30549466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIKRAMRATHOUR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/australia-tour-of-india-india-vs-australia-odi-series-vikram-rathour-on-opening-combination/article30549467.ece

Polly Umrigar award is presented to the best male International cricketer and it carries a citation, trophy and cheque for ₹15 lakh.

Dilip Sardesai award is conferred on both the highest wicket-taker and highest run-getter in Test cricket. Bumrah took 34 wickets in six matches with three five-wicket hauls.

Prolific Saurashtra batsman Chetshwar Pujara was picked for the honour for scoring 677 runs in 8 matches at an average of 52.07 with three centuries and two half centuries.

Bumrah, the world’s number ODI bowler made his Test debut during India’s tour of South Africa in January 2018 and hasn’t looked back since.

He picked up a five-wicket haul in South Africa, England, Australia and the West Indies, becoming the first and only Asian bowler to achieve the feat.

He played a stellar role in the historic 2-1 Test series win in Australia, India’s first Down Under and which helped them retain the Border Gavaskar Trophy.

While Bumrah netted the biggest prize in the men’s category, Poonam Yadav claimed the top prize in women’s section and was awarded the best international cricketer.

The award will be another feather in the leg-spinner’s cap who recently received the Arjuna Award.

Former India captains Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Anjum Chopra were presented the Col CK Nayudu Lifetime Achievement Award and the BCCI Lifetime Achievement Award for women respectively.

A member of the 1983 World Cup-winning team, Srikkanth took on the fearsome West Indies fast bowlers and scored an attacking 38, the top individual score in the low-scoring final at the Lord’s.

He also captained India and post-retirement served as the chief selector and it was during his tenure that the 2011 World Cup squad was picked.

Anjum is one of the finest batswomen and the first Indian to play 100 ODIs. In a career spanning 17 years, Anjum represented India in four 50-over World Cups and two T20 World Cup (played in one).

Mayank Agarwal, who emerged as an impact batsman starting with his debut series in Australia in 2018-19, received the best international debut in men’s category while talented 15-year-old Shafali Verma grabbed the same in the women’s category.

Mumbai all-rounder Shivam Dube, who impressed in the recently concluded T20 series against Sri Lanka, was presented the Lala Amarnath Award for the best all-rounder in the Ranji Trophy while Delhi’s Nitish Rana received the same for doing well in the limited overs competition.

India’s middle-order batsmwoman Deepti Sharma received the Jagmohan Dalmiya Trophy for best woman cricketer in senior domestic circuit while Shafali was picked for honour in the junior category.

Virender Sharma was adjudged the best umpire in domestic cricket while Vidarbha Cricket Association were presented the best performance award in domestic cricket for wining the Ranji Trophy.

BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said, “The BCCI Awards is our way of recognising the finest on-field performances right from the age group to senior level and also honour our legends.”

Board secretary Jay Shah said, “We wanted to make Naman bigger and better and have introduced four new categories— highest run-getter and wicket-takers in WODIs and best international debut men and women — from this year.”

283,2020/01/12,Seam-bowling all-rounder ideal for conditions in New Zealand: Bangar,"Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar feels a seam-bowling all-rounder will be ideal for the Indian Test team in New Zealand considering the favourable conditions there for those who can move the ball.

While he largely retained the squad that played against Bangladesh at home in November, Bangar backed all-rounder Vijay Shankar to be part of the squad for the two Tests.

Shankar was part of India’s World Cup squad before an injury cut short his campaign last summer in the United Kingdom.

“If they go in with 17 players, then there is place for a reserve batsman and all-rounder. Now New Zealand conditions are ideal for seam-bowling all-rounders,” Bangar said on ‘ESPNcricinfo’.

“You see what an impact Colin de Grandhomme has had on the New Zealand team. So someone like Vijay Shankar can be an ideal candidate for that slot, given he is fit wherein it gives the right balance to the squad if he bats at No. 6.

“It will also give India a batting depth and a fifth bowling option.”

The series is part of the World Test Championship and a series win will definitely brighten India’s prospects of reaching the 2021 final.

For the reserve batsman, Bangar mentioned Prithvi Shaw’s name, though the Mumbai player was pulled out of the India ‘A’ shadown tour owing to an injury he suffered during a Ranji Trophy game.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/qh63lx/article25703183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SANJAYBANGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/seam-bowling-all-rounder-ideal-for-conditions-in-new-zealand-bangar/article30548627.ece
284,2020/01/12,'Space unites us': First Iranian-American astronaut reaches for stars,"Jasmin ""Jaws"" Moghbeli earned her nickname during her time as a decorated helicopter gunship pilot who flew more than 150 missions in Afghanistan.

The Marine Corps major, a graduate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and college basketball player can now add another accomplishment to her burgeoning resume: the first Iranian-American astronaut.

Speaking to AFP after graduating in NASA's latest cohort, the 36-year-old immigrant said that she hoped her example might help inspire others from similar backgrounds.

""I would love for everyone to be able to be inspired by everyone, but it is a little easier to be inspired by someone who looks like you or has something in common with you, so I do hope there is that influence,"" she said.

Moghbeli and her brother were born in Germany to Iranian parents, who had fled their native country after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

But Moghbeli grew up in Baldwin, New York, which she considers her hometown and her story after that reads like an immigrant's fairy tale.

At 15, she attended an advanced space camp, cementing her ambition to reach for the stars, one day.

She studied aeronautical engineering at MIT and later planned to become a military pilot (a well-trodden path to the astronaut corps).

Moghbeli signed up in 2005, just four years after the September 11 attack, and her parents were worried about what their daughter might face as a person of Middle Eastern heritage.

""But, once I joined, they gave me absolute support,"" she said, crediting the backing of her family, and later her partner Sam, whom she married three months ago, for her success.

Space diplomacy

Following a brief US-Iranian rapprochement during the Obama years, tensions between the two countries have soared again under the current administration.

President Donald Trump tore up the landmark nuclear deal signed by his predecessor and added Iran to a list of mainly Muslim countries whose nationals are banned from entering the US.

And, last week's killing by US forces of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani raised the specter of a broader conflict. But, Moghbeli said she had personally not faced problems during her time in service.

""I haven't in any way felt that changed anything about how I'm treated,"" she told AFP.

She spoke fondly of close friendships forged during her military missions and astronaut training, feelings that are clearly reciprocated.

At her NASA graduation ceremony, classmate Jonny Kim described Moghbeli as dependable, resilient and fierce. In short, the perfect crewmate Kim would go into the void of space with.

Kim is himself a decorated Navy Seal and emergency physician. He and Moghbeli were two of the five people of color in the graduating class of 11, selected from a record-breaking 18,000 applicants.

As an astronaut, Moghbeli will need to draw upon her experiences and the close calls she faced both as a test pilot and later as a combat pilot, to think fast and mitigate the unique risks that come with space flight.

On asking about how space makes it worthwhile, she says, ""One of the reasons I love working in human space exploration is, it's something we all generally agree on and unite on,"" citing two decades of close US-Russian cooperation on the International Space Station, despite the two countries' otherwise fraught ties.

""I think it is an area where we see diplomacy where we don't see it in other areas,"" she said.

""I think it has an impact,” she added.",sci-tech,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/d5gf2o/article30549062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001NM0GM,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/space-unites-us-first-iranian-american-astronaut-reaches-for-stars/article30549063.ece
285,2020/01/12,Public warned to not get close to ‘Rivaldo’,"The forest department has urged members of the public to not stop and pose for selfies with a wild elephant, known to locals as ‘Rivaldo.’

In a statement, Deputy Director of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), buffer zone, L.C.S. Srikanth, said that the elephant usually inhabits areas near Vazhaithottam, Sigur, Mavanallah, Bokkapuram and Masinagudi. The animal, known for its mild temperament, had also been given medical treatment in 2015 for injuries it had suffered during a fight with another elephant.

After it was successfully treated by the forest department, the elephant had managed to recover from its injuries and continued to inhabit parts of the buffer zone of the tiger reserve. The elephant had also not been any problems to local residents or farmers, forest department officials said.

However, as the elephant was known to roam close to human habitations and along sides of major roads, a lot of residents as well as tourists are said to have been trying to get close to the elephant to pose for selfies, or to even offer the elephant food.

“Though the animal seems like it is harmless, tourists and residents must remember that it is a wild elephant and can attack people when they get too close,” said the statement from the forest department. The department urged people to not stop their vehicles by the side of the road when they see the animal and pose for pictures. They also called on local residents to alert the forest department if they see Rivaldo near human settlements so he can be chased away into the surrounding forests.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/qevz1e/article30554588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB13ELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/public-warned-to-not-get-close-to-rivaldo/article30552071.ece

296,2020/01/12,AIADMK sweeps all 12 PUs in Coimbatore,"Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and Independent panchayat union councillors on Saturday helped the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam make a clean sweep of all the 12 panchayat unions in the district.

At the start of the day, the AIADMK was sure of winning the chairperson posts in eight panchayat unions, given its strength in the union councils. The DMK, by virtue of having more union councillors, was expected to win Pollachi South. And, a contest was expected only in Madukkarai, Sulthanpet and Anamalai unions.

But as it turned out, DMK union councillors helped the AIADMK win the chairperson posts in Madukkarai and Anamalai and Independent councillor tilted the scales in favour of the ruling party in Sulthanpet.

In the six-seat Madukkarai panchayat Union, the AIADMK and the DMK had three councillors each. Soon after the results, both the parties said they had established contacts with the rival camp. But it was the AIADMK that had the last laugh as two of the three DMK councillors did not turn up for the election on Saturday morning.

This left the floor open for the AIADMK to win the chairperson post and B. Udhayakumari did so without even seeing a contest. The only DMK union councillor who was present, R. Prakash, later got the vice chairperson post.

In the 13-ward Anamalai panchayat Union, the AIADMK's K. Santhi won by getting nine votes. Her party had five councillors and had the support of a BJP councillor. The DMK had four councillors and the support of a Congress councillor.

Congress vote for AIADMK

But during the elections, the two Independents supported Ms. Santhi and so did the lone Congress councillor, leaving the DMK wondering what sort of a coalition norm the party followed. The three votes helped her get nine votes.

In Sulthanpet panchayat Union, the AIADMK had five councillors and the support of the lone DMDK councillor to take its tally to six in the 13-ward union council. It had matched the DMK's six, leaving the lone Independent union councillor a king maker. As it turned out, the Independent, P. Manoharan, was a rebel AIADMK candidate. This, the AIADMK sources said, gave it an edge in the union council.

And, the AIADMK's K. Rathinam, widow of former MLA R. Kanagaraj, won the chairperson’s post by getting seven votes. The Independent councillor, Manoharan won the vice chairperson post.

But the DMK union councillors reserved the best of the election day in Pollachi South panchayat Union. The party was expected to win the chairperson post easily as it had eight of the 13 posts, leaving the AIADMK with the rest.

Losing despite majority

In short, it was the only union where the DMK had a clear majority and could have prevented the AIADMK from having a clean sweep in union chairperson election.

But by 11.30 a.m., it was the AIADMK's P. Lakshmi who emerged victorious getting seven votes. The DMK's Chitra could get only five votes.

DMK sources said that two councillors had cross-voted and another turned up late and so was marked absent.

The election to the post of district panchayat chairperson turned out to be easy for the AIADMK as it had won 10 of the 17 seats.

The party had nominated district panchayat ward 7 councillor A. Santhimathi for the post and she was elected unopposed.

300,2020/01/12,"Social media battle heats up as BJP, Congress try to breach ‘Kejri Wall’","The social media battle is fast hotting up ahead of the Delhi Assembly polls with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) triggering a spoof-fest with its parody of a cement advertisement that had featured Boman Irani, in which two brothers try to unsuccessfully bring down a wall - in this case the ‘Kejri Wall.’

The parody advertisement ends with Irani, as in the original, asking why does this wall not break, and the narrator saying, “Kejri Wall -- tutegi kaise? sacchai aur imaandari se jo bani hai (How can it break when its made from a mix of truth and honesty?).”

The Congress hit back with its own parody of another Irani advertisement for Dulux paints, while the BJP jumped in with its parody version of the same Ambuja advertisement used by the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP.

The high-stakes tussle for power in the national capital is also being contested in the virtual world with parties’ social media warriors battle-ready with their ‘weapons’ of parodies, memes and hashtags.

“Especially in an urban constituency like Delhi, it is very important to have a well-defined social media strategy. We have been blessed that we have been frontrunners in that,” says AAP social media strategist Ankit Lal.

“About 200 volunteers from across the globe comprise the core team working on different social media platforms for content creation and ideation for the Delhi Assembly polls,” he told PTI.

The AAP’s spoof of the original Ambuja cement advertisement caught eyeballs and triggered a spoof-fest among the political parties. While playing the original advertisement, the AAP’s media cell added titles to the characters and changed the voice over at the end.

The two brothers, both played by Irani, living in two houses side by side, which in the parody are named the BJP and the Congress, unsuccessfully try to bring down the wall between them by using a tree log named “Delhi LG” and explosives named “CBI raid.”

The Congress hit back tweaking a Dulux paints advertisement that had featured Irani in which he praises his son in front of his prospective daughter-in-law for being a “double M.A” and speaking with cab drivers in English. But she tells him that his house behind him seems “fourth class fail.”

In the parody, Irani is named “BJP” and his “double M.A. son” is “AAP”, while the likely bride represents the people.

When the likely bride says, “Daddy ji aapka ghar toh chauthi fail lagta hai (your house looks class four fail), the voiceover, with ‘Kejri Wall’ written in the background, says, “If there are cracks and fungus in your home, we present Indian National Congress which is two times jumla-proof and two times hypocrisy-proof, meaning double protection.”

Reacting to the advertisement, the AAP shot back, saying “Well tried but..,” and posted a still from the movie Gangs of Wasseypur 2 with the dialogue ‘beta tumse na ho payega (Son, you will not be able to do it).’

The BJP also came out with its parody version of the Ambuja advertisement, naming the two brothers - Mr. Kejriwal and Kanhaiya Kumar and the wall between them as Rashtravaad (nationalism).

The two brothers unsuccessfully try to bring down the wall between their houses by using a tree log named ‘JNU violence’ and explosives named ‘Jamia riot.’

The parody advertisement ends with Irani asking why does this wall not break, and the narrator says, “Tootegi kaise 130 crore bharatiyon se jo bani hai (How can it break when it is made up of 130 crore Indians?).”

BJP also released a spoof of popular TV show ‘AAP ki Adalat’ calling it ‘Paap ki Adalat’ in which a Kejriwal-lookalike is put in the dock and asked questions about the failures of his government to which he responds that he knows only how to protest and not run a government.

Hitting out at the BJP, the AAP tweeted, “So much effort to ridicule one man. Is this all you got? PS: Boring content. If you need any advice on content or satire please get in touch with us.”

After the Twitter battle of parodies, the AAP took a dig at the BJP and the Congress, posting a picture showing a girl writing her exams, a boy (BJP) copying from her paper and another one sitting at the back with hands on forehead (Congress). The caption read, “Summing up the twitter war so far. Get original guys. @BJP4Delhi @INCDelhi.”

Congress’ social media department national convenor Saral Patel rebutted the charge, saying this is not copying, but replying in the same coin.

Patel, who is in-charge of the Delhi Congress’ social media content, asserted that elections are fought on social media more than on the ground these days.

“Social media campaign of a party is the central campaign. Earlier it used to be a secondary campaign, now it is the primary one,” he told PTI.

The AAP has also been using memes to hit out at the BJP and the Congress.

It has tried to corner the BJP for not declaring its chief ministerial candidate, posting a still from the movie Tanu weds Manu Returns with the dialogue by Deepak Dobriyal: “You are a good question, but your question hurt me.”

The Congress has been attacking the AAP on its failures in keeping promises, posting various tweets to highlight such issues using the hashtag “jhaadu ka jhaansa.” ‘Jhadu’ (broom) is AAP’s election symbol.

The result of this online battle will be known on February 11 when counting of votes takes place after polling on February 8.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mhjkgw/article30549825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AAP2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/social-media-battle-heats-up-as-bjp-congress-try-to-breach-kejri-wall/article30549826.ece
301,2020/01/12,Police error leads to acquittal of two accused in Delhi robbery case,"A Delhi court has acquitted two persons in a road robbery case in east Delhi in 2018.

According to the chargesheet, the bike-borne accused persons had robbed gold chains of a man and his wife respectively at gun point early evening.

First, they stopped their bike by the driver’s side window and asked for an address from complainant Jasvinder Singh. As he rolled down the window pane, one of them snatched the gold chain from his neck.

When the victim tried to resist them, another person came on his bike and forced his wife to part with her gold chain at gun point.

The case of the prosecution fell through in the trial as the police committed a procedural error by showing the photographs of the accused persons to the complainant before conducting the Test Identification Parade (TIP). Further, the complainant failed to identify the accused in the trial of the case.

The police also failed to trace the wife of the complainant to record her evidence after she had taken divorce from him.

Freeing the two accused, Additional Sessions Judge Jagdish Kumar said: “In the cross examination, the complainant deposed that on the way to the Mandoli jail for TIP of accused persons, the investigating officer had shown the photographs of culprits, who was apprehended by police, and on the basis of those photographs, which was shown to him he had identified one person in TIP proceedings. So the identification of accused Shadab @ Salman and Deepak have lost its trustworthiness.”

Accused Shadab had refused to take part in the TIP proceedings. Justifying his refusal, the Judge said: “His plea has force as according to him his photographs were also shown to the witness by the police. So this refusal, in the given circumstances, cannot be construed against him.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/police-error-leads-to-acquittal-of-two-accused-in-delhi-robbery-case/article30547563.ece

In the incident that took place at Amar Colony on Friday night, the woman’s brother and other family members sustained injuries, they added.

At around 8 p.m., the group armed with iron rods and sticks barged into the house of the victim, identified as Rukmani, and began thrashing all the occupants, the police said.

“As Rukmani tried to save her daughter, the attackers hit her multiple times... She was taken to a hospital where doctors pronounced her dead,” ACP (Crime) Preetpal Singh said.

303,2020/01/12,Court pulls up Metropolitan Magistrate for fixing maintenance arbitrarily,"A Sessions court here has directed a Metropolitan Magistrate to pass a fresh order on grant of interim maintenance to a woman in a domestic violence case, saying that it was fixed on the desire of the husband.

The Magistrate court had asked the husband to pay ₹2,500 maintenance per month to his estranged wife.

The wife had challenged the order in the Sessions court, submitting that it was a meagre amount keeping in view the handsome earnings of his husband.

The Magistrate had fixed the amount after her husband said that he was willing to offer the said money to her, the woman submitted.

“Without considering the other facts and circumstances, the trial court passed the impugned order merely on the willingness of the respondent/husband when he agreed to pay ₹2,500 per month. It seems that the court passed the said order in haste without considering entire circumstances of the case and also standard of the parties,” Additional Sessions Judge Satinder Kumar Gautan said in the order.

“The contention of the appellant that the amount awarded is meagre has full force in view of sky rocketing prices,” the Judge stated.

“The court is of the view that the impugned order suffers from illegality and perversity and also not on merit, as such, present case is disposed of with directions to the trial court to pass a fresh order on the application,” the Judge ordered.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-pulls-up-metropolitan-magistrate-for-fixing-maintenance-arbitrarily/article30547507.ece

Both the parties, BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel alleged, were politically attacking the Narendra Modi-led Central government by “using the JNU students” to influence the Delhi Assembly elections.

“In view of the upcoming Assembly election in Delhi, the Congress and AAP are joining hands to indulge in low-grade politics. This is a matter of concern for all of us. Both the parties are hand in glove when it comes to corruption, violence and Muslim appeasement.

Severe allegations

In the Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Goel argued, the BJP secured 56.8% votes, the Congress secured 22.46% votes and the AAP came third. Both these parties wanted to form an alliance for the Lok Sabha polls but were “exposed” at the last moment.

Both parties, he alleged, had “instigated violence” and “tried their best” to start riots in Delhi “with the help of a particular community” on the issues of amended Citizenship Act, NPR and the JNU agitation.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-cong-joining-hands-to-take-on-bjps-might-vijay-goel/article30547471.ece

The women have been asked to provide suitable time to the police to record their statement at a place of their choosing.

309,2020/01/12,ABVP activists march against violence,"The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) carried out a march against the violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and in support of the amended Citizenship Act at Delhi University’s North Campus on Saturday.

The protesters were seen arriving in hired private buses outside the Arts Faculty shortly before the march was set to begin. Amid heavy police presence, slogans like “We Support CAA”, “Afzal ke jo yaar hain, desh ke gaddar hain” and “Left Terror, Down Down” were raised.

ABVP joint secretary Anima Sonkar had admitted that two men purportedly seen carrying rods in a video during the attack in JNU last Sunday were associated with the organisation. Talking about her statement and one Akshat Awasthi, who claimed to be a member of ABVP, Delhi University Students’ Union president Akshit Dahiya on Saturday said: “Whatever Anima Sonkar said was irrelevant and if she was involved in any violence then a strict action will be taken against her and as far as Awasthi is concerned, we have clarified that he is not a member of the ABVP.”

Several protesters said that the violence in JNU was “orchestrated by the Left” and an attempt to “malign the image of the ABVP”. Himmanshu Garewal (17), a student of Ramjas College, said: “If anyone from the ABVP is saying that they were involved in JNU violence then that is their personal opinion. The ABVP was not involved. They had nothing to gain from the attack on students of the Left wing.”

Namrata Kumari (20), a student of Satyawati College, said: “The ABVP has nothing to do with JNU violence. I think it was all planned by the JNUSU.”

Many also spoke in support of the CAA. Raj Gupta (19), a student of Ramjas, said: Calling CAA anti-Muslim is wrong because Muslims are not a minority in Islamic nations...”

Ms. Samanta is one of the nine people “identified” by Delhi Police for the violence that was unleased by a masked mob that left several teachers and students, including JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh, severely injured.

“Evidence provided by Delhi Police is negligible. I saw the entire troop (alleged attackers) leave. But without proving anything the police has given out my name. I am scared to step out of campus now. Will Delhi Police take responsibility of my security as well or only for Komal Sharma,” she asked.

Ms. Sharma is one of the alleged vandals who was part of the mob that created havoc on the campus.

“The photo used by the police is of me outside the School of Social Sciences but they have tagged it as the server room. The ABVP itself had posted on social media that I was “restricting registration” but now Delhi Police is using the same footage as “violence,” she added.

312,2020/01/12,'Have been successful in reaching out to seven lakh homes over CAA',"The State unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had completed 70% of its targeted objective of “clarifying misconceptions” about the amended Citizenship Act across Assembly constituencies in the Capital by the time it was notified by the Centre on Friday evening.

Initiated by its national president Amit Shah last Sunday, the local leadership of the party had been directed to reach out to and garner support for the CAA from 10 lakh households in the city between January 5 and 15, according to those associated with the initiative.

By Friday evening, however, those associated with the drive, which is being led by Delhi BJP vice-president Jai Prakash as the pradesh convenor and Manoj Chandel as co-convenor, had already contacted 7 lakh households – averaging a daily outreach of a little over 1.16 lakh homes across 40 Assembly constituencies – from January 5 to January 10.

Party sources said they were confident not only of completing the exercise three days in advance but also about its potential being a “bigger game-changer” for it in the upcoming Assembly polls than initially expected – especially at the dozen Reserved Constituencies – characterised as such due to their Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe populations, in the city.

“We have been successful in reaching out to over 7 lakh homes located in more than 40 Assembly segments in Delhi over the issue of CAA and there is tremendous support for it. The drive is not a part of the BJP’s election campaign but is necessary to dispel the rumours and propaganda being spread against it by opposition parties,” Mr. Chandel said.

“In addition to dispelling doubts about its provisions, we have also encouraged the members of the households we have reached out to to visit colonies and areas such as Majnu ka Tilla and Bhati Mines inhabited by Hindu refugees from different countries to hear their side of the story,” Mr. Chandel added.

According to a party source, while the party’s poll strategy sought to maintain a balance between both national and local issues in its quest for the Delhi Assembly, the outreach drive had revealed that the issue of CAA “was doing well” in Reserved Constituencies, such as Sultanpur Majra, Mongolpuri, Deoli and Ambedkar Nagar in addition to eight others.

This, the source said, was because a “significant majority” of Hindu refugees having reached the Capital from neighbouring countries due to religious persecution happened to belong to the Dalit and Valmiki communities.

“The drive has, so far, proved most successful in Reserved Constituencies due to the existing caste combination there and the fact that a majority of Hindu refugees belong to the same castes. The CAA has emerged as a major factor and can go a long way in furthering the BJP’s prospects in the Delhi elections,” a party leader admitted.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mr99im/article30537591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMITSHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/have-been-successful-in-reaching-out-to-seven-lakh-homes-over-caa/article30546908.ece

This song has been composed by renowned music director Vishal Dadlani who has also sung it,” said Mr. Sisodia.

‘Acche beete paanch saal - Lage raho Kejriwal’ (The last five years went well, keep going Kejriwal) is the party’s slogan for the Delhi Assembly elections. He said that for the next 30 days, people will hear it in every corner of Delhi. “We have prepared 20 teams to perform flash mob on this song. Teams will perform on the song on the streets, at markets and other places.”

Mr. Sisodia also said that by calling people of Delhi “bikau [up for sale]”, BJP has insulted them. “Amit Shah and J.P. Nadda should apologise for calling people bikau,” he said. Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said in an interview that they are against free services, Mr. Sisodia added.

He said that people of Delhi must know that every vote which goes to BJP will be for expensive electricity, water, bus ride, education and health. “They want to make everything expensive and make life difficult for the common people. BJP is struggling in this election, because they have no work to show, they don’t have any leader, any vision, and thus resorting to these statements. People are already dealing with inflation, how much more does BJP want to burden them?” said Mr. Sisodia.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6j603k/article30546860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12DESONG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-launches-lage-raho-kejriwal-poll-song/article30546861.ece
316,2020/01/12,Man kills brother for refusing to share cannabis,"A 30-year-old man was shot dead by his young brother after he demanded cannabis from the latter who refused to share it, in north-east Delhi’s Karawal Nagar, the police said on Saturday.

The father of the deceased later helped the accused dump the body in a vacant plot next to their house, they said.

Ved Prakash Surya, DCP (North East), said that accused Nitin and his father Chander Pal have been arrested and a countrymade gun with empty shell has been recovered from their possession and seized.

Mr. Surya said that around 1 p.m. on January 4, a call was received at Karawal Nagar police station regarding a man’s body that was lying in a vacant plot in SBS colony.

A police team reached the spot and the deceased was identified as Deepak (31) who was a resident of the locality. “A murder case was registered and a probe was ordered. Several teams were constituted for the investigation,” said Mr. Surya.

During investigation, the friends and family members of the deceased were interrogated at length. The call details of the deceased and his friends and relatives were obtained and analysed. Local enquiries were also conducted, he added.

Suspicious behaviour

“The behaviour of the family members was found suspicious. They were also not cooperating with the police. Discreet enquiries later revealed that they were involved in the murder,” said Mr. Surya.

During sustained interrogation, the accused confessed to having killed Deepak before dumping his body. Nitin admitted that he had shot his brother and that his father had helped him dump the body.

The weapon used in the crime was recovered at Nitin’s instance, from the kitchen of their house. Empty cartridge was recovered at his father’s instance.

Deepak was a drug addict. On the day incident, he had come home in the morning and demanded ganja from Nitin who refused. Furious, Deepak took out a countrymade pistol and threatened to shoot at Nitin. A scuffle ensued and Nitin snatched the gun from Deepak and fired at his chest from a very close range. Their father helped Nitin dump the body in a vacant plot near their house.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/man-kills-brother-for-refusing-to-share-cannabis/article30546851.ece
317,2020/01/12,Congress holds meeting to discuss candidates,"The Central Election Committee of the Congress met at party chief Sonia Gandhi’s residence on Saturday to discuss the candidates for the upcoming Delhi elections.

Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) chief Subhash Chopra said another meeting has been scheduled where the party will finalise all the names.

Though Mr. Chopra did not reveal how many candidates were cleared on Saturday, other party sources said that 18 names were discussed and a dozen names were cleared.

“How can I comment on how many names we discussed and how many were cleared? That is our internal issue....but we hope to clear all names by January 14,” Mr. Chopra told reporters after the meeting.

He also played down reports of Congress leaders, including minority leaders like Shoaib Iqbal leaving the party.

“Those who are leaving are not dedicated party workers and members. It is okay as people who do not get tickets will seek opportunities elsewhere,” he said.

The Delhi Congress chief also claimed that members of AAP and the BJP were also in touch with them.

After the CEC meeting, Congress president Sonia Gandhi also met with a four-member group to discuss the incident of violence at JNU on Sunday. The fact finding group, headed by former Lok Sabha member Sushmita Dev, submitted their report to Ms. Gandhi.

The party is likely to release this report on Sunday at a press conference.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l72ape/article30544507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CWCMEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/congress-holds-meeting-to-discuss-candidates/article30546845.ece
318,2020/01/12,"For AAP, performance is perfect poll pitch","Three days after the Lok Sabha election result was announced on May 23, 2019, in which the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was unable to win even one of the seven Delhi seats, party chief Arvind Kejriwal addressed volunteers at the lawns of Punjabi Bagh Club to boost their morale.

“Ab Delhi ki janta ke paas jaa ke bolna, ki ji, bada chunaav khatam hogaya, ab chotta chunav aagaya, ab chotte chunav ke andar, kaam ke uppar vote padna chahiye, naam ke uppar vote nahi padna chahiye [Now you have to go to the people of Delhi and tell them that the big election is over and now the small election is coming and in the small election, vote according to the work done and not on a name],” Mr. Kejriwal had told the volunteers.

The election was about eight months away.

On January 6, 2020, just hours after the dates for the Delhi Assembly elections were declared, the AAP chief held a press conference and said that the elections would be fought on “real issues”. When asked whether these issues will be city specific or national issues such as the Citizenship Amendment Act or National Register of Citizens (NRC), he said: “Delhi’s election will be on education, hospitals, roads, unauthorised colonies, water, free ride for women, free pilgrimage for senior citizens... If we have done work, then vote for us. If we have not done work, then do not vote for us.”

Since May last year, Mr. Kejriwal and senior AAP leaders, through countless press conferences, interviews, public outreach programmes, and advertisements, have reiterated that the Assembly elections will be fought on the work done by the Delhi government and will focus on local issues.

National issues

The party has also been careful in not speaking out aggressively on national issues such as CAA and NRC, or even violence in JNU, despite attempts by the BJP to pull it into debating national topics.

Even the transition in the party’s slogan from “Dilli mei toh Kejriwal” to “I love Kejriwal”, and its latest slogan “Acche beete paanch saal - Lage raho Kejriwal (The last five years went well, keep going Kejriwal)”, increased focus on the work done by the AAP government.

Political analysts told The Hindu that AAP’s firm decision to stay focussed on the work done and sticking to local issues seems to be working out for the party.

“This [focusing on work done] is the only thing that can work out for AAP. And that is the reason why AAP keeps reminding the people of the works they have been able to accomplish. It is a very solid poll plank for them and my sense is that this is going to work for AAP,” said Sanjay Kumar, professor at Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), New Delhi.

“In a recent press conference, Mr. Kejriwal said ‘if we have done work then vote for us, or else don’t’... I have not heard such a strong statement made by any Chief Minister or Prime Minister in the last 30 years I have been monitoring elections,” he said, adding: “This shows that he is convinced that work has been done on the ground.”

Political analyst Neerja Chowdhury said that the BJP has indicated that it is not going to have a chief ministerial face and Mr. Kejriwal’s strength lies in focussing on local issues. “Mr. Kejriwal’s question to everyone is ‘has your life improved as a result of me being in power for five years?’... a lot of people will tell you ‘I got this’ or ‘I got that’... It is a smart move by him, but the BJP will try to move the narrative towards national issues as it suits them,” she added.

Local issues

Senior party leader and head of the AAP manifesto committee, Atishi, told The Hindu: “Delhi elections have always been fought on local issues. Pick up our last poll manifesto, it was also on Delhi’s issues.”

Another AAP leader said that the party knows that the work done by the AAP government is their “strength” and that is why their are banking on it.

Both the experts said that regularisation of unauthorised colonies was also an important issue. “Sheila Dikshit [Former Delhi Chief Minister] had also tried to use the issue, but not successfully. AAP is somewhat on the defence on this topic and is picking holes in the policy. How AAP counters the perception and how BJP goes ahead with the policy is a very critical question,” Ms. Chowdhury said.

“On the topic of Article 370, the AAP chief gave only one statement: ‘We support it’,” Mr. Kumar said, adding: “After that he kept silent as if nothing of this kind has been uttered by him. I think they have a good sense of the popular mood of the people on these issues.”

A tightrope

He said that giving a single statement and campaigning on these issues are completely different. “He does not want to speak in public on these issues because he knows that if he speaks in support, then it becomes very difficult... He cannot be seen as supporting CAA or the abrogation of Article 370.”

“If you oppose CAA or NRC, then many who are willing to vote for you will also turn their back and say in today’s language that AAP is supporting ‘anti-national’ activity,” he added.

Ms. Chowdhury said that the BJP will try to use CAA and NRC to “polarise society” along Hindu-Muslim lines. “It is a tried and tested recipe for success,” she said, adding: “He [Mr. Kejriwal] has taken a position on these issues, but he has not been as aggressive as some other parties... He does not want to go to Narendra Modi’s turf and fight the battle there. He wants the BJP to fight on his turf.”

Thorny subjects

“We are not side-stepping these issues. We have taken a stand on CAA. We have voted against CAA in Parliament” Atishi said.

But an AAP insider said: “We know when to talk what. In Parliament, we had opposed it (CAA), but we will not talk about that during the run up to the elections. We are confident about our work and we will fight the election based on that.”

AAP has also sidelined the demand for “full statehood”, an issue around which the party based its complete campaign for Lok Sabha election. It has merely mentioned that it will be part of the manifesto.

“In May 2019, our survey indicated that people were worried about unemployment and rural distress but it won’t have a direct impact on voting,” Mr. Kumar said. “This is happening in the Delhi elections also, people are in support of CAA or what has happened in Kashmir and they will be very aggressive in supporting it. But that is not going to decide their voting preferences when they go to the polls on February 8,” he added.

While the BJP has been trying to pull AAP to comment on national issues, AAP has also been trying to drag the BJP into talking about local issues and work done by the party.

On January 8, senior party leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia challenged the BJP to compare the work done by his government in schools and the work done by BJP-run municipal corporation in its schools.

Education model

“If you like their [BJP] model of education, then vote for them. I want to ask the BJP, what is your model of education?” he asked while presenting data on both. He said the party would also challenge the BJP to show work done by it in the field of healthcare. The next day, Mr. Kejriwal addressed a press conference and released a “BJP’s MCD model versus AAP’s Delhi govt. model”.

When asked whether concentrating on work done would help Mr. Kejriwal win the upcoming elections, Ms. Chowdhury said: “That is the million dollar question. A lot of politicians, both young and old, believe votes will be on the basis of caste and religion, not work done.”

“A lot of politicians and people across the country are looking at Delhi to see whether people will vote for Mr. Kejriwal for his work,” she added.

“My own sense is that it is very difficult for any party to defeat AAP in 2020 Assembly elections,” Mr. Kumar added.

“Even if you are from the BJP or the Congress, this time, do not vote for your party, this time, vote for Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal had said in January: “Is baar ka vote, aap kaam ke naam pe dena, Delhi ke vikas ke naam pe dena [This time vote for work, vote for Delhi’s development]”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kw3jas/article30546825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AAP3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/for-aap-performance-is-perfect-poll-pitch/article30546826.ece
319,2020/01/12,Strong bond of bhakti,"In the Gita, Krishna analyses the various ways in which devotion takes root in people. He knows that many seek favours of Him for various reasons, for wealth, knowledge, relief from distress, and so on. Though He then claims that one who seeks Him for His sake is very dear to Him, His unparalleled magnanimity is seen in His recognition and response to all who seek Him, irrespective of their motive, pointed out Kalyanapuram Sri Aravamudhachariar in a discourse. None knows better than Him that for every jivatma, crossing this life on earth is beset with hurdles and therefore His devotees find great mental strength in seeking His help. It is held that at the end of Krishna avatar, the Lord departs with the feeling that he has not done enough for Draupadi. When she is in distress and on the verge of extreme humiliation, she knows that none but He alone could help.

Though Krishna is in Dwaraka, her loud cry for help in her utter helplessness, bears fruit in a totally unbelievable manner. It proves beyond doubt His omniscience, omnipotence and omnipresence. But He still has this misgiving that He could not be present in person to alleviate her distress. He says that He is indebted to Draupadi in this account.

He comes to the assistance of Gajendra when the elephant calls out to the one who is the primordial source of all. With extraordinary sincerity He befriends a Guha or a Sugriva; accepts the humble offerings of a Sabhari or a Kuchela and graces them handsomely. When He enters Mathura to meet Kamsa, He goes out of the way to bless Kubja who gains a beautiful form and to shower His grace on the garland vendor. He grants the highest attainment to the unlettered and simple Gopis. It is no wonder that His devotees automatically feel doubly indebted to Him.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/strong-bond-of-bhakti/article30551397.ece
320,2020/01/12,Doctors remove 2-cm bone stuck in boy’s food pipe,"A 2-cm chicken bone stuck in the food pipe of a 10-year-old boy was removed by doctors at a corporate hospital in the city. After finding that a hole in the food pipe had been sealed, he was discharged.

The boy, who hails from Lingampally, was brought to the hospital about a fortnight ago, two days after he accidentally swallowed the bone.

Following high temperature, he was hospitalised for immediate intervention.

A hole was formed at the site where the bone was stuck. A team of doctors led by Raghuram Kondala, consultant medical gastroenterologist at Continental Hospitals, conducted endoscopic clipping after safe removal of the bone from the esophagus to seal the hole.

Any foreign body in the airway may lead to choking and result in death if not removed in time, say doctors. “Such cases must be attended to immediately as delay could increase the risks like food pipe perforation leading to infection, long term complications, and in some cases, it may result in death. Since perforations are common when sharp objects like a chicken bone gets struck, it is important that utmost care is taken while removing the object and stenting to ensure restoration of functionality of the food pipe,” Dr Kondala said.

Method of treatment is dependent on the location of the foreign body. If the object is in the airway, a laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy is needed to be performed to remove it. This procedure involves passing a rigid scope into the airway, viewing the airway to find the object and then using special forceps to remove the item.

If the object is in the esophagus, a scope is passed into the esophagus and special tools are used to remove the swallowed item. Once the foreign body is removed, people usually recover quickly.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ev5xi7/article30552189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy12Chiken,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/doctors-remove-2-cm-bone-stuck-in-boys-food-pipe/article30552190.ece

322,2020/01/12,City teen chosen ball girl for Australian Open,"For someone trying to leave her imprint in the big league of tennis, 14-year-old V. Sanskruti has reason to cheer. She is the only girl from south India to be picked up along with nine others from across the country to be ball-pickers for the prestigious Australian Open.

The Grand Slam tennis tournament is scheduled to take place from January 20 to February 2.

The screening process involved 1,500 applicants from across India and it was further pruned to 250 after which the applicants were called for special tests in Delhi. Of them, 100 were short-listed before the best 10 were selected.

Sanskruti feels it is a “huge opportunity for me to see the world of international tennis and my favourite players from such close quarters”.

The Gitanjali Devshala student, who is a trainee under Dilip at L.B. Stadium and physical trainers Mazhar and Venkat, is slowly making an impact in her age group like picking a team bronze in the School Games Nationals recently.

She owes her trip to Down Under to ITF official J. Shiva Kumar Reddy who took a lot of interest in giving specialised training to select boys and girls from Hyderabad free of cost, to help them get through the screening process. “On my return, I should be a much more confident player and am hoping to make it big as my ultimate dream is to play a Grand Slam,” she says.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hkiji3/article30552152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06-TENNISVSANSKRUTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/city-teen-chosen-ball-girl-for-australian-open/article30552142.ece
323,2020/01/12,"‘Indians no longer voting for values, but for individuals’","The way politics is getting structured around ‘superman’ or ‘superwoman’ though ours is a Parliamentary system, rise in recession among democratic institutions and other trends were explained by senior journalist Rajdeep Sardesai during his talk on ‘What does the future hold in a Modi-fied India?’ organised by Manthan on Sunday.

Listing out changes observed in the past three months in politics and political parties including Shiv Sena realising that it is a mistake to mix politics with religion, he said it is hazardous to predict future in India. However, Mr Sardesai explained 10 trends he has spotted.

Addressing over 100 people, who had gathered to attend the talk, he said that Indians are no longer voting for values, but for individuals. Elections are about people hankering for one strongman or strongwoman who will solve their problems. Example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Central level, and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao at State level were cited to drive home the point.

“Candidates are mattering less and less, and we are slowly becoming elected autocracy wherein the individual matters much more than any institution. And this may be a trend across the world,” Mr Sardesai said, adding that money and media are used as weapons in the process.

Speaking about the second trend which is about recession in democratic institutions in the country, he said that Parliament has become a notice board. Stating that debates were invited after bringing in Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he said democracy demands the opposite which is holding dialogue, consultation, and deciding course of action.

Citing another institution to explain the trend, he said that Delhi Police has named nine individuals in connection with the recent violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi, using various videos circulated by Akhil Bharatiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP). “It is as if violence does not involve ABVP but involves the Left. So, police become the extension of State. This is the Gujarat model. Long before JNU, there was MS University. Between 2002 and 2010, there were several instances of VHP walking into MS University and resorting to violence. Nobody was prosecuted at end of the day.” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3rhnm6/article30552138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY12-MANTHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/indians-no-longer-voting-for-values-but-for-individuals/article30552133.ece

The second busiest toll plaza in the State, after Raikal plaza in Mahabubnagar on NH 44 (Hyderabad-Bengaluru), Panthangi plaza in Choutuppal had received 50,275 vehicles on Saturday. According to officials, this is the maximum number of vehicles that passed the plaza in both the directions on a single day till now, on Saturday, the first day of the Sankranti festivities.

The average daily figures of the two busiest toll plazas, calculated as passenger car unit or PCU per day, as recorded earlier was 25,686 vehicles at Raikal and 20,136 vehicles at Panthangi.

And, the record flow of vehicles continued unabated on Sunday, as people headed back home for the festival, posting similar and higher figures.Vehicles were stranded in long queues, of up to 2 km occasionally, but immediate measures such as toll personnel walking up to the drivers with hand-held devices and the maximum nine lanes kept open, brought temporary relief.

Braving the rain, more than 100 people attended the event, extending their solidarity to the government of India’s initiative, which they called was in the interests of the country.

Vinod Elete, a prominent Indian Australian in Sydney, said that every country has a right to frame its own rules for giving citizenship and that can be extended based on the need and a reason. “If the government of India plans to have its own norms to curtail illegal migration into India, there is no reason to oppose it,” Dr. Vinod said.

Ashok Maram, a senior manager working for a top pharma company, read out the complete text of CAA and said that they were also distributing the full text of CAA pdf file on social media platforms of Indians to make them aware of the Act.

The agenda of the meeting was not finalised and the two Chief Ministers were expected to hold one-to-one discussions on the issues facing the two States as well as the latest developments at the national level. That the meeting would focus on political issues, not the pending reorganisation issues, is evident from the fact that officials, particularly those dealing with the State Reorganisation affairs of the two States, were reportedly not invited to the meeting.

The last meeting of the two Chief Ministers had been held in September last week when they discussed the proposed diversion of Godavari water to Krishna river through inter-linking. Senior officials said there was no invitation extended to them so far to attend the meeting. Asked about the issues that were likely to figure in the discussions, a senior official said, “It’s anybody’s guess.”

The meeting was reportedly convened to discuss the national level developments, particularly the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act by the Centre and the moves to mount pressure on the States to take up works on preparation of the National Register of Citizens. The Telangana government had opposed both the CAA and the NRC, while the AP government had extended its support to the CAA, but opposed nationwide implementation of the NRC.

Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety (CMRS) J.K. Garg inspected the JBS-MGBS Metro corridor along with HMR managing director N.V.S. Reddy, senior engineers, technical experts of L&TMRH, and independent engineering consultancy Louis Berger, over the past three days and issued the mandatory safety certificate on Sunday.

Govt. to fix date

Receiving the safety certificate, Mr. Reddy stated that Government will decide the date of inauguration soon.

The last remaining corridor of Phase I of the Hyderabad Metro Rail Project has a length of 11 km and nine stations — JBS-Parade Grounds; Secunderabad West; Gandhi Hospital; Musheerabad; RTC X Roads; Chikkadapally; Narayanaguda; Sultan Bazar and MGBS. Corridor I or Red Line between Miyapur and L.B. Nagar as well as Corridor III or Blue Line are already fully operational for the past two years, though these were opened in different stages.

The CMRS, during the course of his inspection, checked the safety certification of the 25-KV overhead electrical traction and other electrical installations by Chief Electrical Inspector General, fire clearance of the nine stations of the corridor by DG, Fire Services, signalling and train control systems by Thales, Canada, Internal Safety Assessment by Halcrow, UK, and results of the tests of various technical parameters during trial runs.

His thorough examination of the entire corridor covered the following aspects — all safety tests related to viaduct, track, signalling, telecom, trains and electric traction system; speed trials at high speed to check train behaviour; station structures, lifts and escalators, entry/exit points, ticketing systems, control rooms and passenger amenities.

The CMRS also looked at the Bhoiguda metro rail over-bridge, its bearings, viaduct etc. where the Secunderabad West station is located. Secunderabad East metro station has been opened on Corridor III or the Blue Line.

329,2020/01/12,"One campaign, two elections in Singareni coal belt","With elections for the recognised trade unions of Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) round the corner, union leaders have also plunged into electioneering for the municipal polls scheduled to be held on January 22 in the Municipal Corporation of Ramagundam (MCR).

As a majority of voters under the MCR are Singareni miners, contesting parties have roped in their trade unions for electioneering to lure the coal workers.

TRS versus BJP fight

It may be recalled that in the Ramagundam Assembly segment, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) had received a severe blow in the Assembly elections in December 2018. TRS candidate Somarapu Satyanarayana lost to party rebel candidate Korukanti Chander, who contested on a All-India Forward Bloc ticket.

However, Mr. Chander joined the TRS, while Mr. Satyanarayana shifted his loyalty to the BJP.

Now, the TRS had roped in its trade union Telangana Boggu Ghani Karmika Sangham (TBGKS) to campaign for the candidates in the municipal elections. Accordingly, the TBGKS leaders are touring the coal belt region and conducting meetings to lure coal workers at the mines and also in their colonies to attract their family members.

The TBGKS leaders have been promising the miners revival of the Dependent Employment Scheme under the Medical Invalidation Scheme, free power, ₹ 10 lakh-interest-free loan and ₹ 1 lakh bonus to miners, etc.

Highlighting failures

On the other hand, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) affiliated to the BJP had also intensified its electioneering in the coal belt region “exposing” the failures of the TRS government in the Singareni collieries.

BMS State president Kengerla Mallaiah is spearheading the campaign in support of BJP candidates in the MCR polls. Mr. Mallaiah was formerly associated with TBGKS.

He, however, joined the BMS recently after allegedly being neglected in his former party.

BMS leaders have alleged that the State government had failed to revive the Dependent Employment Scheme, and there was a lot of corruption in the Medical Invalidation Scheme.

They also said that the government had not regularised the promised proxy coal miners.

Flaying the government for not opening underground mines to create employment, BMS leaders charged that Ramagundam region is being polluted with open cast projects.

Non-supply of air conditioners to every coal miner, non-construction of new quarters, non-opening of auxiliary industries in the coal belt to provide employment to local youth, drinking water woes in spite of flowing of river Godavari along the coal belt etc would dominate the campaign.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/one-campaign-two-elections-in-singareni-coal-belt/article30546384.ece
330,2020/01/12,Drunk man kills daughter,"Enraged after a bitter argument with his wife on Friday night, a drunk man throttled his five-year-old daughter to death in Mansoorabad of LB Nagar here on Saturday morning.

Police said Avidi Durga Rao, who works as a watchman of an apartment building, had a heated argument with his wife A Ganga Bhavani after she refused to give him money for buying liquor, and went to bed. They stay in watchmen quarters of the building.

Around 7 a.m. Bhavani, a domestic help left for work and asked her husband to drop their two daughters off to school.

“The mother was surprised to see the victim, Yamini, still sleeping and tried to wake her up. She noticed that Yamini was lying unconscious, and immediately called her brother, who took the girl to a nearby private hospital where doctors declared her brought dead,” LB Nagar inspector V Ashok Reddy said.

Ligature mark

The doctors found a ligature mark on the neck and told Bhavani that her daughter was throttled to death. She suspected her husband and lodged a complaint with police.

“As his wife refused to give him money to buy alcohol, Durga Rao wanted to take revenge on her by killing Yamini, on whom Bhavani has more affection,” Mr. Reddy said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/drunk-man-kills-daughter/article30546352.ece
331,2020/01/12,‘Learn from protesters how to unite against fascism’,"People’s protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and attacks on students were prominently mentioned in the speeches delivered at the 50th anniversary of Revolutionary Writers’ Association (Viplava Rachayithala Sangham or Virasam), here on Saturday with the tag line ‘50 years of creative resistance’.

Revolutionary writer, journalist and translator Kanchan Kumar, during his inaugural address, urged writers and cultural activists to learn from protesters how to organise against ‘fascism’. “People are telling revolutionaries how to unite. We need a united cultural front now,” he said, after recalling how protesters across the country came together after CAA and violence at Jamia Milia Islamia.

Tracing through the protests in Aligarh Muslim University followed by attacks on Jawaharlal Nehru University where students were agitating against fee hike, he noted that scrapping of Article 370A and 35A was “beginning of the end” for the government which had won with brute majority just a year ago.

In Shaheen Bagh, Muslim women, who have never been part of any protest, came out and stood against the “fascist regime”, he observed, and said people of all religions and walks of life stormed the streets of Kolkata in protest against CAA. Ruling class is now in trouble, owing to people’s resistance, he added.

He likened the present day’s youth resistance to the 1970 era when Virasam was founded in the context of Naxalbari and Srikakulam struggles and murder of revolutionary writer Subbarao Panigrani.

In the same year, Virasam was formed, with revolutionary poet Srirangam Srinivasa Rao as the founding president, and Digambara Kavulu, Rachakonda Vishwanatha Shastri, Kodavatiganti Kutumba Rao, Vara Vara Rao, Chalasani Prasad, Krishna Bai as members. This was a watershed moment in the struggle, as several revolutionary songs and writings were later translated into all Indian languages, to build a united forum for creative resistance.

Poet Yakoob, too, spoke.

332,2020/01/12,Kite and Sweet festival from tomorrow,"Hyderabad is getting ready to host its popular annual event — the International Kite and Sweet Festival 2020 — coinciding with the three-day Sankranti festival at Parade Grounds from January 13 to 15.

Kite flying is a tradition during the festival and since 2016, the Tourism Department has scaled it up to a major festival by inviting national and international kite flyers from across the globe. It subsequently added Sweet festival from 2018 to popularise traditional sweets prepared by people from different States who have made Hyderabad their home.

Minister for Excise, Tourism and Culture V. Srinivas Goud, sharing details of the festival at a media conference here on Saturday, said the kite festival will have participation from 15 countries with 40 international and 60 national flyers. A special night kite flying event is also scheduled on all three days, he said.

The unique feature this time is that traditional games will be included in the festival and introduced to the present generation. Games like ‘gilli danda’ (game of tip and cat), ‘Taadu Bongaram’ (spinning top), sack race, three-leg race, ‘Thokkudu Billa’(hop scotch), marbles, ‘Isurrayi/thiragali’, lemon and spoon race, ‘Ashta Chemma’ and art like ‘Rangoli’ etc., will be organised at the Gymkhana Grounds during the three-day festival, he said.

Hyderabad has about 1.5 crore population and many will go to their native places to celebrate the festival but for those celebrating the festival in city, the kite and sweet festival with traditional sweets and snacks, prepared by women hailing from different States, will re-create the ambience in the city itself.

About 1,000 varieties of sweets and snacks will be prepared and displayed during the festival by homemakers hailing from Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab, apart from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, he said. There would also be food courts with cuisine of Telangana, and stalls showcasing handicrafts and handloom as other attractions.

15 lakh expected

Tourism and Culture Secretary Burra Venkatesham said the festival drew over 10 lakh visitors last time and this time, they were expecting 15 lakh visitors. He made an appeal to public to cooperate with the Department to make the festival eco-friendly and requested them to bring cloth bags to carry sweets and carry their own water bottles and refill them with the water provided at the venue to reduce plastic pollution although bottled water would also be available. The Minister and officials later visited Parade Grounds to oversee the arrangements for the festival.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/n71k9/article30546094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy12kiterev,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kite-and-sweet-festival-from-tomorrow/article30546090.ece
333,2020/01/12,Proposal to be reworked for parking in private plots,"The GHMC is attempting to revive the proposal to invite private plot owners to allow for construction of multi-level parking (MLP) lots in their premises. This time, they are re-designing the proposal to minimise the corporation’s role, so as to make it attractive.

The fresh proposal entails identifying agencies which have the capacity and experience in building MLPs, and facilitating agreements between them and the plot owners interested in giving out the premises.

If more of them are in the fray, the proposal may include empanelling of agencies, for the plot owners to choose from.

GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar held a meeting with officials where the proposal was thrashed out in detail. The Commissioner instructed officials to prepare a comprehensive report about the methodology in the coming 10 days, after studying the models adopted by other cities such as Pune, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi and also other well-known cities world over.

The idea is to establish MLPs at least in 100 locations across the city, Mr. Lokesh Kumar said, and asked the officials to contact Kuwait-based KGL group which is in the line of the subject in question to gather required documentation. He also asked them to collect RFP from Hyderabad Metro Rail and Traffic Police so that the process may be expedited.

Even after entering an agreement with the agency, ownership rights over the plots will not be impinged, he sought to assure. As the structures are pre-fabricated, they can be dismantled easily when the plot owner desires to develop the land. The parking charges and profit sharing ratios too will be worked out by the agencies in consultation with the plot owners, and GHMC will have no say in it. The corporation’s role will be limited to ensuring adherence to rules and regulations.

Application

The GHMC, however, will undertake the work of developing an integrated app for the benefit of customers using the MLP lots, so that they can get the information of free slots anywhere by a click, or book them in advance. If need be, management of the app too will be handed over to private agencies, by calling for global tenders.

It may be recalled that when a call was given earlier asking private plot owners to register with GHMC for construction of MLPs, it failed to evoke any response. Only three applications were received for the proposal.

334,2020/01/12,More relief for ailing ex-coach,"BCCI senior selection panel chairman M.S.K. Prasad called on ailing cricket coach M.R. Baig at a private hospital here on Saturday before the latter was discharged after being treated for ulcer.

Baig, 79, was a BCCI coach along with Hemu Adhikari for the national camps at Lal Bahadur Stadium here in the late 70s when big names like Kapil Dev, Dilip Vengsarkar, Shivlal Yadav were there.

Mr. Prasad, who was also a trainee of Baig at one time, informed The Hindu that when his friend Prakash told him about the coach’s ill-health, he immediately made made a visit to him at the hospital. “That’s when I spoke to V.V.S. Laxman (former India cricketer) and explained about Baig sir’s condition. He immediately agreed to bear the entire medical expenses. Though both of us can clear the bills irrespective of the amount, we later agreed that we should give an opportunity to all those players who have trained under him to contribute,” he explained.

The duo added a few international players to a WhatsApp group and all of them “poured out their love and affection with unbelievable contributions”. Donations have also been requested from players’ association of Hyderabad as well as the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA), Prasad said.

But, thanks to the initiative of Hari Prasad, CEO of Apollo Hospital and a former Ranji player trained by Mr Baig, a huge discount was given in the medical bill when he was discharged on Saturday. Balance of the money pooled in will be put into a fixed deposit so that the family members can be benefited by way of the recurring interest generated from the fund, explained Prasad.

“I am grateful to all the cricketers, well-wishers and friends who have come forward and raised such a huge amount. We are all indebted to Baig saab and wish him a speedy recovery. We will also try our best so that he gets the prestigious Dronacharya Award,” Prasad said.

335,2020/01/12,"Solapur-Hyderabad pipeline of IOC to entail over ₹1,000 cr.","A Solapur-Hyderabad petroleum product pipeline that Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has proposed is likely to be implemented as a strategic link by the national oil company at an estimated cost of a little over ₹1,006 crore.

Conceived to achieve multiple objectives, particularly ensuring continuity in supplies to key demand centres, the pipeline will serve as a crucial connection between the Koyali and Paradip refineries of IOC.

The combined capacity of the two refineries is 28.7 million tonnes. Post an augmentation of the Koyali refinery that IOC is planning, the total capacity will be nearly 32 MT. In other words, the Solapur-Hyderabad Link Pipeline (SHLP) will facilitate movement of petroleum products between the east and west coast. This, it will do by becoming a key link between two cross country facilities – Koyali-Ahmednagar-Solapur Pipeline; and Paradip-Hyderabad Pipeline – that will be 2,335 km long.

Reconnaissance survey for the pipeline from Solapur to Hyderabad has been completed. The length will be about 376 km and traverse through Gulbarga district of Karnataka. IOC has a marketing depot in Gulbarga, at a location about 130 km from Solapur. In 2018-19, the depot received petroleum products of about 360 TMT from various sources through rail and, as per a study, estimated to touch about 604 TMT by 2029-30.

The proposal, in view of alignment of the depot along the proposed route of SHLP, is to connect Gulbarga depot too with the pipeline, according to official documents. While Solapur has a marketing depot, Hyderabad end of the pipeline will be connected to Malkapur, where a terminal is to be developed under the Paradip-Hyderabad Pipeline project.

An important task SHPL will undertake is maintaining supplies, in case of a planned maintenance of one of the refineries or in case of exigencies, to Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Thethree States together accounted for 20% of petroleum products consumption in the country during 2018-19. Now, IOC sources products from other oil marketing companies in these States and rest by product movement from own sources through coastal, rail and road mode.

Thus, the pipeline will reduce dependence on other refineries and movements, and also be cost economical over time.

Considering the significance of the facility, senior officials of IOC’s Pipeline and Marketing Divisions in November had decided the pipeline should be taken up on strategic basis. A detailed feasibility report has been prepared. IOC has initiated the process of appointment of financial institution/agency for financial appraisal of SHLP.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/solapur-hyderabad-pipeline-of-ioc-to-entail-over-1000-cr/article30546061.ece
336,2020/01/12,Why are bushfires raging in Australia?,"The story so far: Australia’s bushfires have razed more than 10.3 million hectares (103,300 sq km) of land — roughly the size of South Korea — since September. News agencies reported that 27 people and up to a billion animals have been killed and thousands subjected to repeat evacuations as the unpredictable fires spread over large areas in the east and south-east. An extended weather reported in one country (wet monsoon in India) appears to have translated into an unmitigated disaster half a world away for another (delayed monsoon, dryness, drought and wildfires in Australia.

Why did Australia suffer from drought?

Playing out to the north and south of the equator, the progression of monsoon winds more or less corresponds to the natural occurrence of troughs and ridges in the same pressure field as seen on the weather map.

Every trough is matched by a crest somewhere — troughs represent areas of low pressure featuring ascending motion of air and its cooling, clouds and rain while ridges mean the reverse: high pressure from descending motion of air, dryness, heat, no clouds or rain.

The 2019 June-September monsoon in India started its withdrawal on October 9, against the normal date of September 1, making it the most delayed in recorded history. It was also the strongest in recent years with a surplus of 10% in 2019 — both attributed in part due to the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). During a positive IOD phase, the west Indian Ocean warms up anomalously (creating lower pressure and wet climes) relative to the east (higher pressure and a dry phase, towards the Australian side).

Climate models had indicated that the positive IOD may persist longer than typical events do — active right from May 2019 before peaking in October-November and decaying only during the first week of January 2020. In this manner, a positive IOD that persisted longer than usual is thought to have contributed to a delay in transition of the monsoon trough from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere and onset of the Australian monsoon.

The IOD breakdown occurs when the monsoon trough moves into the southern hemisphere in early December (this is when the North-east monsoon in India draws to a close).

What followed the delay of rain?

The resulting drought and heat have seen Australia grapple with fire over many parts of the country from September. New South Wales (NSW), the country’s most populated state, alone reported loss of more than 2,000 homes and over 650 damaged. The south-eastern state of NSW alone saw more than 4.9 million hectares being scorched. No single Australian state seems to have escaped the wrath of ravenous fires, but none more deadly than in NSW. A plume of smoke has drifted from Down Under across the South Pacific Ocean, reaching Buenos Aires, thousands of kilometres away.

The number of total animals affected could be as high as one billion nationwide, and that is at best a conservative guess. The persistent heat and drought buttressed by the positive IOD conditions may have acted as a perfect foil for the tinder-like conditions, with climate change scientists and naysayers pitched on either side of a towering inferno, arguing their respective cases of what might have triggered the devastation. Timely arrival of the monsoon rains could have helped the federal and state governments contain the spread of the fires but its delay past the normal December-end timeline seem to have let them down badly.

Is it due to climate change?

Scientists and researchers see an indelible stamp of climate change etched on the conflagration. In recent years, Australia has experienced longer dry conditions and exceptionally low rainfall. On the other side, climate change naysayers have been quick to point out at other triggers; for instance, one of the strongest IOD events ever on record. Claims that a big wave of arson may have fuelled the raging bushfires also have gone viral on social media, with U.S. President Donald Trump leading in the front. But the NSW Police have clarified that only 24 people are currently facing criminal charges for deliberately igniting fires and even fewer have actually managed to start large fires. There are close to 150 different fires burning across NSW even as this is being written. Commentators fear that the mindless politicisation of climate change may have given enough cannon fodder for lot of misinformation on social media.

Why does it matter?

Experts say climate change has worsened the scope and impact of natural disasters such as fires and floods. Weather conditions are growing more extreme, and for years, the fires have been starting earlier in the season and spreading with greater intensity. South-east Australia has been abnormally dry since September under prevailing positive IOD conditions, which means that it would need bouts of significant rainfall to have an impact on the fire risk. Although the region experienced some rain early this week, it is not enough. Given this, the risk of additional fires remains high.

Early in January, the State of Victoria had declared a state of disaster and NSW a state of emergency. The State of Queensland also briefly declared a state of emergency in November. There are currently more than 2,000 firefighters working on the ground in NSW alone, and more support is on the way with the U.S., Canada, and New Zealand promising to despatch additional firefighters. But unfortunately, Australia is only just entering its summer season.

What lies ahead?

Typically, a “positive IOD brings below-average winter-spring rainfall to southern and central Australia, with warmer days for the southern two-thirds of the country. Positive IOD events are often associated with a more severe fire season for South-east Australia. Natural causes are known to light up the fires most of the time, such as lightning strikes in drought-affected forests. Dry lightning was responsible for starting a number of fires in Victoria’s East Gippsland region in late December, which then travelled more than 20 km in just five hours, according to State agency Victoria Emergency. The fire season in Australia is always dangerous, with the 2009 Black Saturday fires killing 173 people in Victoria, making it the deadliest bushfire disaster on record. But conditions have been unusually severe this year, fanning the flames and making firefighting difficult. Australia is also experiencing one of its worst droughts in decades. The Bureau of Meteorology said in December that last spring was the driest on record. Meanwhile, a heatwave in December broke the record for highest nationwide average temperature, with some places sweltering under temperatures well above 40º Celsius. Strong winds have also made the fires and smoke spread more rapidly, and have led to fatalities. Normally, temperatures peak in January and February”, meaning the country could be months away from finding relief.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/ihbxdx/article30545486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bush-fires,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/why-are-bushfires-raging-in-australia/article30545487.ece
337,2020/01/12,"A strong message to violators of norms, says Swaraj","The demolition of four apartments at Maradu as ordered by the Supreme Court is a strong message to those who violate rules with impunity and illegally erect structures, overlooking adverse fallout on the environment, said M. Swaraj, Thripunithura MLA, in whose constituency the structures were located.

He decried the practice of giving ‘unauthorised numbers’ to buildings built in violation of norms and regularising them. “A few thousand buildings across Kerala have been built with scant regard to norms. They include over 3,000 in Ernakulam. Builders are mostly emboldened by the go ahead or blind eye turned by officials concerned. There are also instances of courts issuing stay order on stop memo issued by local bodies, citing non-adherence to procedure. Often, local bodies connive with builders and deliberately flout procedures while issuing stop memo, so that builders get a favourable court order,” he said.

All this contribute to wanton proliferation of illegal structures. This can be lessened if all stakeholders, including unscrupulous officials, are held accountable and penalised, Mr. Swaraj said.

“There must also be clear earmarking of zones where houses can be built, where controlled farming can be done and where only farming is permitted, so that there are no grey areas,” he said.

“The obsession of people of Kerala to construct big houses which cover most of their property must end. Having visited many countries, I can vouch that few people have as big houses as in Kerala. Moreover, all constructions must be environment friendly, more so since Kerala witnessed a deluge of massive scale in 2018.

District Collector S. Suhas, who is also the Chairman of the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), said that the precision felling of the apartments was a result of team work, by personnel of different departments. “So much of hard work went into the whole process. I take this opportunity to appreciate the role played by personnel of the police and also those of the Fire and Rescue Services, Regional Transport Office and the Health Department. People of the locality too cooperated, especially when Section 144 was declared in the area,” he said.

District Police Chief (Kochi City) Vijay Sakhare elaborated on how a four-member core team which comprised him, the District Collector, Sub Collector Snehil Kumar Singh and Deputy Commissioner of Police G. Poonkuzhali went about the task meticulously, holding meetings almost every day since the process to pull down the apartments began three months ago, to ensure that everything worked according to plan.

The process was set in motion following a meeting convened by Chief Secretary Tom Jose and the Sub Collector was appointed the nodal officer. The plan of action was chalked out and the agencies to raze the structures were selected. The toughest part was to convince apartment owners of the need to vacate their homes, for which a series of meetings were held, Mr. Sakhare said.

“Ten days ago, the focus shifted to bring down the structures through controlled implosion, without collateral damage to nearby houses and other structures. Much brainstorming also went into regulating traffic and the crowds that thronged Maradu on the two days to witness the high-rises being brought down. Close to 1,000 police personnel and personnel of Fire and Rescue Service were deployed and a dry rehearsal was held, to condition personnel of different agencies.”

Moreover, emergency response teams were constituted and clear-cut details drawn out on each aspect, including evacuation of people from houses in the vicinity. Information was frequently shared through media, while sirens went off at pre-fixed timings, to convey to each stakeholder what happened next, Mr. Sakhare said.

On pollution and allied concerns about removing over 70,000 tonnes of debris from the four sites, he said that the contracting firms concerned must adhere to the protocol prescribed for the purpose.

The blast has been scheduled at 11 a.m. The prohibitory orders that were clamped in the area will continue for the day.

The demolition will be a less risky affair when compared to the exercise on January 11 as the area where the building has come up is sparsely occupied. All precautionary exercises will be replayed on Sunday too, said Muhammad Arif Khan, secretary of the Maradu municipality.

“The dust inside will take a while to clean, but fortunately, nothing happened to the house,” said Sicily Joseph, whose house is a few metres away from H2O Holy Faith. While the family had been prepared to spend a few days at a relative’s place, they were now considering cleaning the house and moving back in before nightfall, she said. They had covered their house with a large plastic sheet that did not do much to keep the dust away.

Ambrose E.J. who lives in a house over a century old close to the flat, also returned to his house by Saturday evening, with no damage to the structure but dust in every nook and corner.

While Shaji Antony had complained of cracks developing in his home during the pre-demolition work at Holy Faith, the implosion caused no damage, he said. Despite covering the windows with paper and the entire structure with a sheet, the layers of dust prevented the family from returning to the house the same night, though Mr. Antony returned in the evening to examine the place.

Mr. Antony, along with most of the residents near the flat, chose to stay away from the shelter arranged for them at Sacred Heart College, Thevara, choosing to stay with relatives instead. Of the two buses arranged to ferry residents within the evacuation zone of 200 metres to the shelter, only one had to be operated for around eight people from the neighbourhood. Mr. Antony said he chose to avoid the shelter since he was unsure of the medical facilities that might be available at the shelter for his elderly father.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/9kr33k/article30546979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-HOUSEjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/neighbours-return-to-find-houses-covered-in-dust/article30546980.ece
342,2020/01/12,"Kundannur bridge safe, says PWD","The 1-km-long Kundannur bridge is safe for all types of vehicles and pedestrians, although Holy Faith H2O, one of the apartments which was brought down through implosion on Saturday, was located a stone's throw away, sources in PWD (NH wing said).

The department had deputed an assistant executive engineer to the area, to keep tabs on the implosion process and its possible impact on the bridge’s structural stability. “We had issued letters to Maradu municipality to ensure that the bridge that links the city with the port and West Kochi is not affected in any way”.

A report would be sent to the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways about the implosion, which went ahead as was planned. “A team led by our chief engineer and executive engineer will inspect the bridge in the coming days,” they said.

Work on the Kundannur flyover was suspended for two days in view of the implosion. It will resume on Monday.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kundannur-bridge-safe-says-pwd/article30546964.ece
343,2020/01/12,Shelters for evacuees have few takers,"It was a family gathering of sorts at the house of Sahadevan Nedumpilly, a resident near Alfa Serene, on Saturday morning.

Only, it was not planned but in a way forced up on the extended family by the demolition of the apartment.

At the designated hour of temporary evacuation ahead of the demolition, Sahadevan’s four brothers and their families who lived within the exclusion zone of the demolition site moved into his house, which was outside of it.

There were many such families who chose to either move in with their friends and relatives rather than choosing to go to the temporary shelters opened by the authorities at the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies (KUFOS) at Nettoor, over a kilometre away on the national highway, and at Sacred Heart College, Thevara, for evacuees from the exclusion zone of Alfa Serene and H2O Holy Faith.

“They were reluctant to move out for a short span of time lasting about three hours. So, a majority of residents near Alfa Serene chose to move to their ancestral homes or with relatives outside the exclusion zone. None moved to the shelter at KUFOS, while a mere 20 people from near Holy Faith were shifted to Sacred Heart College,” said P.H. Nadeera, Maradu Municipal Chairperson.

District Collector S. Suhas said there was no compulsion on residents to move into the shelters. “There were no restrictions outside the exclusion zone of 200 metres as long as there were no law and order issues. Majority of them stayed back to witness the demolition and opted for vantage points rather than shelters, which were some distance away,” he added.

Besides, people did not want to move far away from their homes, many of which had already developed cracks during pre-demolition work, and hung around in the immediate neighbourhood to return home at the earliest once access restrictions were lifted.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/shelters-for-evacuees-have-few-takers/article30546949.ece
344,2020/01/12,Maradu blasts bring dark tourism to the fore,"Dark tourism was at its best at Maradu, where three apartment blocks were brought down through implosion on Saturday, with two others to follow suit on Sunday.

Thousands of people, many from other districts, poured in to witness the implosion of the highrises. While most of them occupied vantage points on the 1-km-long Kundannur bridge, others gatecrashed into apartments and waterfront properties of relatives and acquaintances.

There were others who chartered boats to witness the implosions from a safe distance from the backwaters. The waterbody had turned busy during the past month, with visitors wanting to take a close look at the apartments, preferring to take a boat cruise.

The curiosity was so much so that a few luxury hotels in the vicinity of the apartment blocks were flooded with calls during the past month, offering irresistible amounts to book rooms, to witness the implosions live. A board kept at a hotel in the vicinity by a stakeholder of the implosion process welcomed ‘delegates’ to the ‘implosion viewing gallery’ on one of its floors.

With an image of it going viral, the hotel management clarified that it had little to do with such boards placed by those hosting private events. It further told the stakeholder to remove it. The hotel also clarified that it empathised with the families for whom the day was a sad day.

Another hotel, Le Meriden, whose annexe abutted an apartment which was brought down on Saturday, evacuated all guests and employees from the annexe and also the main hotel building. The hotel was among those that were flooded with enquiries from people who wanted to reserve rooms at vantage points to view implosions of Saturday and Sunday.

“We went the extra mile and deployed a structural engineering firm a fortnight ago to do a pre- and post-implosion assessment of our buildings, especially the annexe near the pulled down structure,” said Tejus Jose, general manager of the hotel. All guests and employees were provided masks, and temporary structures were put up near the NH Bypass to shelter them during the implosion time, from 10.30 am. Our aim was to cause least discomfort to guests.

The exposed parts of the hotel were covered, and power and LPG connections switched off. The swimming pool was covered with tarpaulin. Underground water tanks were filled to the brim to assess whether there was a fall in water level due to any possible crack. The hotel’s exteriors and lawns were cleaned using water hydrants, Mr. Jose said.

A city-based tour guide P.R. Rajesh said many foreign tourists who arrived in a cruise ship enquired about the implosion of the buildings. “We apprised them of the sensitiveness of the issue and ecological issues, which they understood. This was in stark contrast to people making a beeline to witness the implosions, with the same ease as for witnessing Thrissur Pooram,” he added.“We should not promote dark tourism in Kerala and must not allow it to become yet another tourism product. It is unethical to derive pleasure from the loss of other people. Rather, focus must be laid on the emphasis that the apex court laid on respecting the law and environment,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/8pbqi/article30546939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-CROWD-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/maradu-blasts-bring-dark-tourism-to-the-fore/article30546940.ece
345,2020/01/12,Implosions go like clockwork,"The demolition of H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene went like clockwork except for an initial delay of 15 minutes for the aerial enforcement of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

District Police Chief (Kochi City) Vijay Sakhare said while the enforcement of Section 144 was complete on land and water, it was not complete on air. As a result, the operation was delayed.

A helicopter encircled the blast sites a few times before the third siren for the demolition of H2O Holy Faith followed by the fourth siren for the demolition of the twin towers of Alfa Serene.

“The fifth siren after the demolitions was delayed because there was some blockade on the national highway, and the sixth siren was for resuming traffic through minor roads and allowing evacuees to return home,” Mr. Sakhare said.

According to District Collector S. Suhas, the operation was a wonderful job executed in a manner beyond expectations. The demolition of H2O Holy Faith was perfect with no debris falling into the backwaters. The falling of a portion of the debris of one of the twin towers of Alfa Serene into the waterbody was purposefully done to protect the adjoining buildings, he said.

“All vibration readings were within the safety limits. Nearby houses sustained only minor damage, and the owners will be compensated as per law. The Kundannoor-Thevara bridge is perfectly safe,” Mr. Suhas said, adding that there would be no complacency in the demolition of the remaining two apartments on Sunday owing to the successful implosion of the first two apartments.

Mr. Sakhare said that while nobody is sure about these things (demolitions), the experts were always very confident. “The collateral damage is absolutely nil. Whatever minor damage incurred was less than what was expected. There has been no perceptible damage to properties,” he said.

The operation was monitored by the Chief Minister’s Office and the Chief Secretary, Mr. Sakhare said. He also praised the hard work put in by Snehil Kumar Singh, Sub Collector and nodal officer for the demolition, as well as all the agencies that made the operation a success. “We will finish it off tomorrow by demolishing the rest of the two apartments and whatever needs to be done for cleaning debris will be done,” Mr. Sakhare said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/implosions-go-like-clockwork/article30546920.ece
346,2020/01/12,Evacuation protocol was strictly followed: District Police Chief,"District Police Chief (Kochi City) Vijay Sakhare has termed as baseless the allegation that the protocol for evacuation of families from the exclusion zone of the implosion sites was not followed.

“The entire information regarding the demolition and evacuation was not only put on the digital platform, including social media, but hard copies of instructions were also distributed to all households. On Friday, there was a drill, and on Saturday morning, the residents were informed of the evacuation, and it was broadcast over radio as well,” said Mr. Sakhare.

He added that the municipality had conducted awareness campaigns over the past several days. “We also sent evacuation parties in the morning [Saturday] to check whether anyone was left out since we had anticipated that there would be a few splinters within the 50-metre radius and wanted to ensure their personal safety,” said Mr. Sakhare.

He said all efforts were made for proper evacuation, and that the police had not come across even a single complaint. People cooperated and supported the operation greatly because of which we could carry it out with clockwork precision. Everyone was out of their homes by 9 a.m. and had there been some resistance, they would not have cooperated,” Mr. Sakhare added.

Riyas Kadavil, a resident who had complained about lacunae in the evacuation process, expressed satisfaction over the implosion. “There was no fresh damage to houses after the blast except for dust, which could be managed,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/evacuation-protocol-was-strictly-followed-district-police-chief/article30546910.ece
347,2020/01/12,Locals riled over alleged official apathy,"Residents in the neighbourhood of Alfa Serene were an agitated lot on Saturday as they accused the authorities of not doing enough to safely evacuate them to temporary shelters ahead of the implosion of the apartment complexes at Maradu.

Unlike the impression created by the Sub Collector and other authorities through the media that all arrangements had been made for the evacuation, nothing was done on the ground, and the residents were in complete dark about the process, they alleged. There was even a minor argument with police personnel who came to evacuate them.

“Except for a notice served by the municipality a few days ago, we were told nothing about the evacuation. We were moving out on our own volition out of fear for our lives,” said Riyas Kadavil, a resident.

Motioning towards people engaged in the last-minute scramble to cover their dwellings from dust and debris, Jasbeer, another resident, said they literally had to fight with the authorities on Friday night to even get sheets to cover their houses.

But not everyone got it as the elderly couple V.N. Subramanyan, a retired High Court employee, and his wife Nirmala vouched. “None of us were told anything about the evacuation nor were we given any material for covering our houses,” said the 77-year-old.

Standing outside her small house, which had developed multiple cracks since the pre-blast demolition, 58-year-old K.D. Sarasakshi was anxious about the safety of her dwelling. “While the apartment owners were given lakhs in compensation, the authorities are maintaining complete silence about repairing our houses. This is a small house, but it is all I have, and there is no way I can rebuild it,” she said.

Disha Pratapan, municipal councillor of Ward 33, said except for door-to-door delivery of notices on precautions to be taken ahead of the demolition, not even a meeting was called by the Sub Collector to discuss evacuation.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/s7rq6a/article30546888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHOTO-2020-01-11-08-55-23,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/locals-riled-over-alleged-official-apathy/article30546889.ece
348,2020/01/12,"A near-perfect job by engineers, says Nadeera","Maradu Municipal Chairperson T.H. Nadeera presented the mood in the municipality after the demolition of two residential apartment complexes on Saturday when she said it was a near-perfect performance by engineers and officials involved in the work.

More than anything else, she was happy that none of the houses close to the demolished building complexes sustained serious damage though the compound wall of a house near H2O Holy Faith complex was damaged, while a few other houses had cracked windowpanes. They are generally non-issues for a municipal authority that has been on the edge of its seat for the past two months over the issue of safe demolition of the buildings.

Initially, there were apprehensions about what would happen when such large structures were brought down. But the nerves have been calmed, and there is a sense of reassurance now, she said. Ms. Nadeera added that she was relieved that the demolition of Alfa Serene apartment complex did not result in large quantum of debris falling into the backwaters. Only a small quantity of debris fell into the backwaters, she said after a group of councillors examined the spot where the debris was noticed.

Disha Prathapan from Thattekkad Division, which housed Alfa Serene complex, expressed a sense of relief. She said it was God’s blessing that everything passed off with no property being damaged. Only three houses were immediately reported to have sustained some damage in the division, and an assessment will be done, while clean-up work is well under way in most houses. Even the dust problem is not too serious, she added.

R.K. Sureshbabu, councillor, said the people of Maradu shared the fears of people across the State who had not witnessed large-scale demolitions before. He felt that the engineers and technicians had done their work well, and that there was now a great sense of relief.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/l6mipg/article30546849.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-REMAINS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-near-perfect-job-by-engineers-says-nadeera/article30546850.ece
349,2020/01/12,Residents near razed apartments heave a sigh of relief,"At 1.02 p.m. on Saturday, as soon as the final siren rang out, marking the end of restrictions clamped over the 200-metre exclusion zone around the two Maradu apartment complexes that were demolished on Saturday, Hari sprinted back to home, which was the closest to Alfa Serene, one of the two demolished structures.

His anxiety was understandable considering that cracks had appeared near the landing of the staircase leading to the first floor of his house, while a window pane had been broken during the pre-blast dismantling work.

Walking in and out of the rooms checking for potential damage, he emerged from his home through a thick blanket of dust with a calm countenance. “Except for a few breaches on the tin roof by projectiles flying off the debris, there was no other visible damage,” he said.

His immediate neighbours, Elzy Antony and her husband, also heaved a sigh of relief after rushing back to their home. “We are just happy that it is over without major problems. Hopefully, the authorities will clean up the dust as promised,” said Ms. Antony.

Right next to the houses lying in a heap of rubble was the first tower of the 16-storey Alfa Serene. In the hours before it was brought to smithereens, the building had wooed quite a lot of visitors, who scurried to take pictures and selfies.

Earlier, when the twin towers of the apartment complex came crashing down with a thunderous bang, causing a minor tremor in the areas nearby — in fact, much louder than when H2O Holy Faith was brought down five minutes earlier — onlookers who had occupied spaces atop buildings outside the exclusion zone let out a loud cheer.

Those on the third floor terrace of an under-construction house bordering the exclusion zone later claimed to have felt a vibration, prompting the panicked owner to send them off the terrace.

Sandhya, a nearby resident, was seen running back to her home as a vast cloud of dust began to engulf the area.

“It was the first such sight in our entire lifetime. It is amazing how such a gigantic building came down in the blink of an eye,” said a smiling Susan accompanied by her friend Jayasree.

Stopped in his tracks, Mirza, a 10-year-old who was having an animated conversation with his friend about the blast, said it was just a “super” sight seeing the buildings go down.

Earlier, as the time for the blast approached, there was a maddening rush by onlookers to find vantage points to witness the spectacle. However, early birds had already appropriated all potential viewpoints, leaving late comers dejected. Two youngsters could be seen pleading with those crowded on the third floor of a building who turned them away quite unsympathetically, saying it was already “houseful”.

Amid the melee, Aneesh, who was an electrician at Alfa Serene and rendered jobless for over three months, cut a sobre figure. “I cannot watch the building that fed me for over seven years go down,” he said before walking away.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/473yj5/article30546800.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12-KI-MARADU-SKYLINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/residents-near-razed-apartments-heave-a-sigh-of-relief/article30546802.ece
350,2020/01/12,Maradu demolition: Debris to be reused for construction,"Almost everything of the over 70,000 tonnes of debris of the apartment blocks erased through implosion at Maradu will be transported to yards spread over 10.6 acres at Aroor and Chandiroor within 70 days and from there to be reused for construction.

The demolition contractor will be responsible for segregating the debris and retrieving steel (the reinforcements) for reuse in civil works, in the course of the coming 45 days. The rest of the debris will be cut to size ranging from 6 mm to 20 mm, using rubble master, a concrete-and demolition-downsizing machine, and transported to the yards, sources said.

This aggregate can be used to construct roads and solid blocks used for buildings, said Achyuth Joseph, partner of Aluva-based Prompt Enterprises, which bagged the tender to remove the debris for ₹35.16 lakh.

“The rubble master machine, imported from Austria, is expected to arrive in Kochi on January 20. The debris that is sorted to standardised sizes can be used for making floor tiles, hollow bricks, and for paving roads.”

The debris of H2O Holy Faith and Jain Coral Cove apartments can be fully reused, since they have been built using hollow bricks. Those of Alpha Serene and Golden Kayaloram can be used for filling basement of buildings, since they were built using bricks which may be tough to be downsized to standardised pieces, he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/x1dgqo/article30546612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/maradu-implosion,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/debris-to-be-reused-for-construction/article30546309.ece
351,2020/01/12,Maradu demolition spectacle attracts ‘tourists’,"Jaseerah C. and her family travelled over 160 km from Malappuram to Kochi on Saturday morning just to join the thousands who watched the two flats come crashing down.

“We were anxious about the implosion and if something would go wrong. But the entire scene was worth the travel,” said Jaseerah, who stood with her husband and son, right behind the point where the Kundannoor-Thevara bridge was cordoned off.

While her husband, who was interested in the implosion, was keen on staying in the city till the two other flats were razed on Sunday, the family decided to leave on Saturday evening.

From across State

Families with children in tow arrived from across the State to watch the implosion, with thousands of people armed with selfie sticks, cameras, and pollution masks, thronging the road leading to the bridge and the adjoining service road.

The crowd whooped and whistled when the third siren announced the impending implosion at H2O Holy Faith, and rapidly retreated when a large cloud of dust engulfed the area.

Some onlookers such as Madhu A.S. were regular commuters along the route who were accustomed to seeing the flats.

“We are unlikely to see something of this sort again – such a large building being pulled down,” he said. Echoing similar sentiments, James, a retired naval employee and octogenarian from near Thripunithura, arrived two hours ahead of the implosion, to ensure he found a spot to watch it.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jawowv/article30546225.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TVMARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/maradu-demolition-spectacle-attracts-tourists/article30546211.ece
352,2020/01/12,Dakar Rally | Paulo Goncalves of Hero MotoSports Team dies in crash,"Motorbike rider Paulo Goncalves of Portugal died after a crash during the Dakar Rally in Riyadh on Sunday. He was lying 46th overall going into the seventh stage from Riyadh to Wadi Al Dawasir.

The 40-year-old, representing Hero MotoSports Team Rally, and competing in his 13th Dakar Rally, suffered the fatal fall after 276 km in the seventh stage in the 339-mile route from Riyadh to Wadi Al Dawasi. The organisers informed that he was pronounced dead in hospital after he was found unconscious following a cardiac arrest.

Goncalves was the 2013 FIM Cross Country Rally World Champion, and was runner-up to Marc Coma in the 2015 Dakar Rally.

In a release, Hero MotoSports Team Rally condoled Goncalves’ death. “ The organisers released an alert at 10.08 [a.m.], and dispatched a medical helicopter that reached the biker at 10.16 [a.m.] and found him unconscious after going into cardiac arrest. Following resuscitation efforts, the competitor was taken by helicopter to Layla hospital where he was sadly pronounced dead.”

353,2020/01/12,Dakar Rally | Portuguese Goncalves dies in crash,"Portuguese motorcycle rider Paulo Goncalves died after a crash in the seventh stage of the Dakar Rally in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, organisers said.

The 40-year-old Hero Motorsports entrant, taking part in his 13th Dakar Rally since making his debut in 2006, fell after 276km of the special stage from the capital Riyadh to Wadi Al Dawasir.

“The organisers received an alert at 10:08 and dispatched a medical helicopter that reached the biker at 10:16 and found him unconscious after going into cardiac arrest,” organisers said in a statement.

“Following resuscitation efforts in situ, the competitor was taken by helicopter to Layla Hospital, where he was sadly pronounced dead.

“The entire Dakar caravan would like to extend its sincere condolences to his friends and family.”

Goncalves was the first competitor to die in the gruelling endurance event since Polish motorcycle rider Michal Hernik in Argentina in 2015.

The Portuguese finished in the top 10 at the Dakar Rally four times and was runner-up in 2015 to Spaniard Marc Coma, who is competing this year as co-driver to double Formula One champion Fernando Alonso.

Goncalves suffered mechanical problems on Friday, having to change his bike's engine to stay in the race, and dropped to 46th overall after the sixth stage.

“The target now is to do my best, because the result at the end...there is no way to get a good result. Instead Ill try to do good stages every day possible and that's what I'm looking for,” Goncalves said then.

The experienced Portuguese had competed in the Dakar on three continents, from its origins in Africa to South America and this year's debut in the Middle East.

The 2013 cross country rallies world champion was representing the Indian Hero Motorsports team, along with his brother-in-law Joaquim Rodrigues, after five years racing with Honda.

Goncalves crashed out on the fifth stage in Peru last year. Rodrigues broke his back in a Dakar crash two years ago but returned after extensive surgery and was 27th after stage six.

Sunday's 546km stage, the longest of the event, was won by Spaniard Joan Barreda with American Ricky Brabec extending his overall lead in the category.

Australian Toby Price, the defending champion, finished an hour and 20 minutes behind Barreda but organisers said he stopped to try to help Goncalves and will have his position recalculated.

Spaniard Carlos Sainz, a two-times Dakar winner driving a Mini buggy, took his third stage win of the event in the cars category to extend his lead over Toyota's reigning champion Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar to 10 minutes.

Mini have now won six of the seven stages.",motorsport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/dijx2t/article30550380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUTO-MOTO-RALLY-DAKAR-POR-GONCALVES-DEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/dakar-rally-portuguese-goncalves-dies-in-crash/article30550381.ece
354,2020/01/12,"CAA meant to give citizenship, not take it away, says Narendra Modi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Sunday that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was aimed at giving citizenship and not taking it away.

Addressing a gathering of youth at Belur Math, the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission, in West Bengal’s Howrah district, on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda, Mr. Modi accused those opposing the amended law of “playing political games” and “fuelling misconception among the youth”.

‘A lot of questions’

“What is there in this Act? Why was it needed? There are a lot of questions in the minds of the youth which have been fuelled by various people. Lot of youth have awareness. Yet, there are some who are victims of misconception, rumours. It is our responsibility to make them understand,” he said.

Mr. Modi’s remarks on the day, also observed as International Youth Day, assumes significance as there were widespread protests in Kolkata against the CAA during his two-day visit, particularly by youth and students.

He asked the audience whether people who faced “religious persecution in neighbouring countries should be left to die”.

""We only implemented what the great freedom fighters including Gandhiji had wished to do"".

Reiterating that the Act is aimed at providing citizenship not taking it way, the Prime Minister said, ""We are not taking anyone’s citizenship. A person irrespective of his or her religion, whether he/ she believes in God or not but has faith in the Constitution of India can seek citizenship under already laid down procedure”.

‘No adverse affect on demography of northeast’

The Prime Minister also tried to assure that the Centre has made provisions that the CAA will not have any ""adverse impact on the demography and culture"" of north eastern states.

“As far the question of north eastern states go they are our pride. The Centre has made provisions that there will be no adverse affect on culture and demography of north east because of this law,” he added.

Mr Modi said that had his government not brought the amendment to Citizenship Act, there would have been no debate on it and the world would not have taken note of the atrocities committed by Pakistan on its minorities. ""It is the result of our initiative that Pakistan has to answer how they treated their minorities in the past 70 years,” he added.

Takes a dig at Mamata

Later in the day participating at an event organized by the Kolkata Port Trust (KoPT) the Prime Minister raised the issue of non implementation of central schemes like Ayushman Bharat by the Mamata Banerjee led government. Ms Banerjee who had met the Prime Minister on Saturday has urged him to rethink on the CAA. She had also joined the protest of her party’s student wing against CAA on Saturday and on Sunday she did not participate in the sesquicentenary celebration of KoPT where she was scheduled to be present with Mr Modi.

“Under the PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, 8 crore farmers have benefitted as about 43,000 crores rupees have been transferred to their account through direct benefit transfer.. When there is a direct transfer, no cut money is involved syndicate does not get anything. Why would someone try to implement such a scheme,” Mr Modi said targeting the TMC government.

The Prime Minister said that he feels pained that benefits of Ayushman Bharat and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi do not reach the people of West Bengal and added that he prays that” good sense prevails over the policy makers of Bengal."" During the event the Prime Minister also announced that KoPT will be christened as Shyama Prasad Mookerjee Port Trust. Mr Modi said that Mookerjee, had set up foundation of industrialization but his contributions were largely ignored.

Trinamool reacts

Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Abhishek Banerjee said has said that they have “no differences with PM Modi renaming the Kolkata Port after one of the Stalwart legends of Bengal.” However, he added that it would not help the people of the State. “The name change brings very little relief or benefit to the lives of common people of Bengal,” he said. The Prime Minister, Mr. Abhishek Banerjee said, “could have announced any Port Development or Waterways Development initiatives which created further jobs & investments, it would have been the perfect gift to the youth of Bengal on Swami Vivekananda's birthday.”

He further noted that the Prime Minister has not responded to Ms. Banerjee’s appeal to disburse “approximately ₹30,000 crore due to be paid to West Bengal, ₹7,000 Crore grant for Cyclone Bulbul, the Iron Bridge he had promised 3 years ago for Gangasagar Mela etc, all these burning issues which needed attention from the PM, seemed completely missing.”",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/7ik0tp/article30548691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/pm-modi-says-caa-is-aimed-at-giving-citizenship-not-taking-it-away/article30548665.ece

357,2020/01/12,Corpn. steps up vigilance after seizure of stale meat in city,"The Kozhikode Corporation has stepped up vigilance on bakeries and hotels in the city to check the use of stale meat in food items. The move comes after the seizure of 200 kg of stale chicken brought to Kozhikode from Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station through the Mangala Lakshadweep Express on Thursday. Detailed inquiries proved that the package was meant to be delivered to a frozen foods trader based in Manjeri.

Corporation Health Officer R.S. Gopakumar said stale meat was usually supplied to large-scale manufacturers of fried snacks such as samosa, puffs, cutlets, chicken rolls and fast food such as shawarma. “The stale meat absorbs the flavour of the spices better and increases the taste of the snacks. Hence some hotels use it for shawarma. On the other hand, the low prices of the meat tempt large scale manufacturers to purchase it,” he said.

The Manjeri-based trader is already under the scanner of the Corporation health wing after 200 kg of stale meat supplied by the firm was seized from some shops in the city last year. “There are several others, including some from Kasaragod, who supply stale meat in Kozhikode. Hence we are stepping up vigilance,” said Dr. Gopakumar.

Assistant Commissioner of Food Safety P.K. Aleyamma said the meat seized from the train was packed in polythene bags, immersed in thermocol containers and then covered in a jute sack. There were 10 such boxes altogether, without any label or address on them. The identity of the buyer was traced from the number of the vehicle that arrived to pick up the luggage at the railway station.

Haryana farms

“Meat is available at very cheap rates or even free of cost at large-scale chicken farms in Haryana. It is probably rejected meat of chicken dying of some kind of disease. It is purely unfit for human consumption,” said Dr. Gopakumar.

The samples of the meat seized have been sent to the Regional Analytical Laboratory to ascertain its quality. The Corporation would take further action based on the report, he added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/corpn-steps-up-vigilance-after-seizure-of-stale-meat-in-city/article30546062.ece
358,2020/01/12,Tamilisai promises to share best practices between State,"THOOTHUKUDI

Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said that she aimed at bridging the gap between Tamil Nadu and Telangana in the areas of trade, commerce, tourism, maintenance of waterbodies and technology.

The Governor, who honoured the best exporters of Thoothukudi at an event conducted by the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said she was particularly interested in taking forward the name that the district had earned in terms of business.

“Thoothukudi is one of the few districts with air, sea, road and rail connectivity. It produces abundant banana and value-added products. Salt production is a huge industry and spices trade is also quite considerable. With a host of products that are being exported from the district, it is evident that trade is booming and schemes like ‘Make In India’ are well utilised,” she said.

Speaking of the state of affairs in exports, she said India was successfully exporting milk, its value-added products and even bullet-proof jackets.

Recounting the term prior to the BJP came to power in 2014, the Telangana Governor said Indian milk products never met international health standards and lacked nutritive value. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi ensured that all cows are vaccinated. This automatically provided better quality of milk. In no time, we were exporting,” she said.

She said bullet-proof jackets made in India that underwent severe scrutiny were being widely utilised world over. She said the quality of the products produced now spoke for themselves.

Ms. Soundararajan went on to say that the long-time demand for an Information Technology Corridor in Thoothukudi would be taken up with the Central government. “When I contested in the elections here, I had come to understand that this was one of the main demands of the people. I also understood that businessmen required a convention centre. Just because I am in Telangana does not mean that I am unaware of the issues here as I am daughter of south Tamil Nadu. I will attempt to aid in all ways,” she said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/tamilisai-promises-to-share-best-practices-between-state-thoothukudi/article30551659.ece

Mr. Nallakannu visited Mr. Kannan, who was released on bail after being arrested for his controversial address against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister, Amit Shah, at a recent anti-Citizenship Amendment Act, at his residence here on Sunday.

Speaking to reporters, he condemned the arrest of Mr. Kannan stating that freedom of speech was being stifled with such arrests.

“While people like Mr. Kannan were being arrested for a routine speech, people who had issued criminal intimidation like cutting tongue was left to go scott-free,” he said.

The freedom fighter also condemned the attack by goons on students of Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. Instead of arresting the assailants, the police have booked the victims themselves, he said.

Stating that freedom of speech and writing was being stifled, he said such acts were anti-democratic and facist.

Mr. Nallakannu condemned the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Government in the State claiming that the AIADMK that had voted in favour of CAB and helped it pass in the Parliament was now seeking dual citizenship for Sri Lanka Tamil refugees.

Cutting across party lines, the elected representatives underlined the need to hear the views of a majority of the public before taking a final call by the government.

The hearing, which was convened at the Collectorate here, was presided over by Collectors Shilpa Prabhakar Satish and Arun Sundar Dayalan.

The speakers suggested that during the gram sabha meetings, public views may be recorded and accordingly decisions taken. This would ensure a smooth transition and also avoid unnecessary confusion and anger from any quarters.

Post-bifurcation of Tenkasi district, certain village panchayats under the panchayat unions of Manur, Pappakudi, Melaneethanallur and Alangulam among others had to be taken up for delimitation.

Nine village panchayats in Manur union, 14 in Pappakudi panchayat union, 9 village panchayats in Melaneethanallur and 8 village panchayats in Kuruvikulam were identified by the officials for the exercise. The modalities were explained by the officials at the beginning of the meeting.

While the elected representatives pointed out certain suggestions/objections over the inclusion of some villages/panchayats to particular unions, the officials and the Collectors agreed to listen to the views of public over the next meeting before giving a final shape to the entire exercise.

Some other speakers suggested formation of new panchayats/unions for effective administration, which too, the officials said, they would examine the possibilities. Mr. Lakshmanan reiterated that whichever village panchayats werre to be bifurcated or merged with, the officials shall seek the views of the villagers concerned through the gram sabha meetings and stressed them not to confine within a small gathering of elected representatives and make announcements.

Ms. Shilpa Prabhakar Satish said that the views would be sent to the government and the decisions based on a majority of the public views, she noted.

364,2020/01/12,Couple take top positions in Sivakasi panchayat union,"Family in politics is not new when it comes to local body elections. T. Vanaraja of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, a two-time chairman of Sivakasi panchayat union, has now got his daughter-in-law, V. Muthulakshmi, 33, elected to the post after the party swept 17 seats out of the 31 post of members in the union.

The political novice Ms. Muthulakshmi is happy that her husband V. Viveganraj was elected as the vice-chairperson of the same union.

The couple have emerged victorious on their first election. They had filed their nominations for the direct election to the posts of councillors in Sivakasi panchayat union in 2016, when the election got cancelled.

Mr. Viveganraj started his political career nine years back as Sivakasi union youth wing organiser of the DMK. Later, he became the Sivakasi south union party secretary.

He has been running an offset printing unit and is also into fireworks manufacturing. “My wife has been my partner in our business and comes to office regularly. She knows how to run a business, but I need to introduce her to full-time politics and make her politically sociable,” said Mr. Viveganraj.

He said that his role would be only to assist her in serving the people and not to dominate in her new role.

“I know a little bit of politics since my family has been into it for long. But, only now I have come into active politics. I am happy that my husband has become the vice-chairman, but I am confident that soon I can work independently as the chairperson,” Ms. Muthulakshmi said. The post of chairperson of Sivakasi union has been reserved for women.

She said that she came know more about the plight of the people of her union when she went for campaigning. “The first thing I noticed is not many streets lights are functional. Besides, many roads that were laid when my father-in-law was the chairperson need to be relaid,” said Ms. Muthulakshmi, a mother of two children.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ccneiz/article30550854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ma13SivakasiMuthulakshmijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/couple-take-top-positions-in-sivakasi-panchayat-union/article30550024.ece

366,2020/01/12,When winking and glaring stopped polls,"Believe it. Indirect election to the post of Chairpersons of two panchayat unions in Virudhunagar district was stopped reportedly over winking of eyes and glaring at councillors of a rival party.

A casual look at the strength of councillors belonging to different parties would reveal that the DMK, (without any cross voting) would have made a cakewalk in Rajapalayam panchayat union. However, in Sattur, the DMK was just one short of a simple majority in the 16-member council.

In Rajapalayam panchayat union, where DMK had 15 councillors against 9 AIADMK councillors, G. Singaraj of DMK was pitted against M. Kanda Krishnakumar of the AIADMK.

As the AIADMK insisted that the voting by the members should be done as per the numerical order of the wards, the AIADMK member K. Mariammal (Ward 1) was the first to cast her vote.

“After she exercised her franchise, the Returning Officer made her to sit separately from other councillors. Just then, R. Vallimayil (ward 2-DMK) had started to cast her vote, when Mr. Kanda Krishnakumar shouted at one of our councillors,” said Mr. Singaraj. “His contention was that our councillor had glared at Ms. Mariammal. It was then the RO asked him not to shout and all of a sudden Mr. Kanda Krishnakumar started yelling at the RO complaining that he was supporting the DMK,” Mr. Singaraj said.

The AIADMK men joined their candidate and it resulted in a ruckus after which the ballot box was pushed down. The RO said that he would stop the election to which the DMK objected as they claimed that only the AIADMK was creating trouble.

“Immediately, the RO said that he developed chest pain. The police then removed us from the hall,” he complained.

“The entire election process was being videographed and it would reveal who was at the wrong end. If the State Election Commission cannot conduct a proper election with just 24 councillors in a closed door amid a huge posse of policemen, what kind of election is this? Why did not the police register any case against trouble mongers,? “ asked DMK Rajapalayam MLA S. Thangapandian.

Meanwhile, even before the election process could start at Sattur, one of the AIADMK councillor complained that a DMK councillor had signalled at a ruling party woman member by “winking” and that was enough to stop the election.

AIADMK has five members, DMK 8, one BJP and two independents in Sattur.

The ROs said that the election in both the unions were postponed due to law and order problem.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/when-winking-and-glaring-stopped-elections/article30548442.ece

He said that he hoped to replicate the model across all police stations in the city, to bring down the instances of youth getting involved in crimes.

Out of the 13 panchayat unions, the posts of Panchayat Union Chairpersons in six panchayat unions went to DMK and six to AIADMK.

DMK won through contests in Madurai West, Alanganallur, Sedapatti and Tirupparankundram. In Usilampatti and Madurai East, the contestants won unopposed.

Usilampatti panchayat union experienced tension between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. as members of AIADMK blocked the Peraiyur- Usilampatti road and took part in a road roko, seeking the halting of the election. Members of the AIADMK said that DMK candidate Ranjani was involved in unlawful activities and must not become the chairperson. Enraged by her victory, members of the AIADMK threw tables inside the voting room and later took part in a road roko.

A panchayat union ward member from AIADMK, Chellapandi, attempted self-immolation outside the Madurai East Panchayat union office alleging malpractice in the conduct of elections. He also alleged that his fellow member from the union was kidnapped by the opposition.

370,2020/01/12,Muslim women oppose CAA,"A large number of Muslim women, under the aegis of Women India Movement, Dakshina Kannada, gathered outside Town Hall here to protest against CAA, NRC and the recent death of Jaleel and Nauseen in the police firing.

Addressing the protesters, writer Jyoti Guruprasad said that by excluding Muslims from the list of communities persecuted in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh, whose grant of Indian citizenship has been expedited, the Centre has sown a seed of hatred. Instead of accepting dissent, the government has used force to gun down two innocent Muslims.

Mujahida, from the South Karnataka Salafi Movement, said Muslims who have stayed back in India following partition are followers of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, who turned down the two-nation theory of Muhammed Ali Jinnah. Muslims here believe in the Constitution that gives every one the right to practice their religion. They will continue to fight against the Union government till it takes back the CAA.

Sakeena, a relative of the deceased Jaleel, accused the police of failing to show restraint in controlling protesters and of gunning down her relative, who did not have a criminal background.

Social activist Nazma and National Womens Front’s National Committee member Dildar also spoke.

Enumeration exercise still under cloud

Despite the appeal by Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh asking people to cooperate with Accredited Social Health Activists and Auxiliary Nursing Midwifery in enumeration works, fears persist about information being used for NRC. During the protest, Shahida Tasleem, State president of Women’s India Movement, Karnataka, asked Muslim women to give details to ASHA workers and ANMs only if they are confident of the latter.

“If they come to your house, please send them away stating confusion about the ongoing exercise. Let these ANMs understand (our predicament) and build pressure on the government to stop collecting documents for the National Population Register.

371,2020/01/12,Northeast needs special attention: P.B. Acharya,"P.B. Acharya, former Governor of Nagaland, said on Saturday that the Northeast demanded special attention from the empowered States of the country. He was speaking after receiving the New Year Awards 2020 sponsored by Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Academy of General Education, Syndicate Bank and Manipal Media Network Ltd. here.

Besides Mr. Acharya, the other recipients of the award 2020 are: A.G. Kodgi, former MLA; K.R. Kamath, former Chairman and MD, Punjab National Bank; M. Mohan Alva, chairman, Alva’s Education Foundation; and Pratap Kumar, Professor, Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Kasturba Medical College. The New Year Awards are being given since 1941.

Mr. Acharya said all eight states of the Northeast had international borders and were backward in terms of development. Many infiltrators had entered the Northeast resulting in a demographic change. Major universities from other States can lead by initiating various programmes for development and emotional integration, he said.

Mr. Kodgi said the country could progress only when it focused on the development of villages. Mr. Kamath said that banking had undergone a lot of changes in the last four decades — from trust based to doubting, proactive to reactive, outgoing to self-protective. Dakshina Kannada, known as the cradle of banking, which at one time had a banker in every household will be left with only one public sector and one private sector bank. “But I am sure our legacy of banking will continue in the times to come,” he said.

Mr. Alva said that it was a misconception that wealth and fame are important. Instead it was ideals that were more important than these two. Dr. Kumar said that one should focus on the strengths and prioritise one’s time and create a timeline of activities. People should do a little self analysis at the end of each working day, he said.

372,2020/01/12,Dredger still on Surathkal coast; auction plan gets nod,"Dredging vessel Bhagwati Prem that was beached at Surathkal on October 28 night by the New Mangalore Port Trust (NMPT) still remains at the same place as against the rrust’s assurance to get it removed by January 2020.

The process of auctioning the vessel, following its owner M/s Mercator’s failure to remove it, is yet to commence even as NMPT has now got approval for the same from the Shipping Ministry.

NMPT Chairman A.V. Ramana told The Hindu a public notice/ newspaper publication for the auction will be issued by this month-end.

NMPT had beached the vessel, which saw flooding in its engine room, fearing it might sink during the 3rd low pressure of the season in October last. Another dredger of Mercator, Tridev Prem, sunk in the Sea within NMPT limits on September 2 under similar circumstances thereby posing a threat to other vessels using the port.

Beaching of Bhagwati Prem however had not gone well among local fishermen and environmentalists.

While fishermen feared their fishing activities will get affected, College of Fisheries, Mangaluru, had of warned damage to the coastline if the vessel continued to remain at the same place.

College Dean A. Senthil Vel, who had conducted a detailed study of the impact of grounding of mv River Princess off Candolim Beach in Goa during 2000, said that the vessel’s long presence for 12 years severely damaged the coastline.

Mr. Ramana however blamed Bhagwati Prem’s owner Mercator and the Director General of Shipping for the continued presence of the vessel.

He said: “NMPT took the initiative of beaching the vessel well within the port limits just to save environment. It is only a social obligation that we had done beaching. Now we have got approval from the Union government for auctioning the same as per the laid-down procedure.”

The Chairman said: “We are seriously on the job. A government approved valuer before auctioning is getting finalised. Public notice/ newspaper advertisement is likely to be released by end of January. We will take the thing to its logical conclusion.”

However, Mr. Ramana was not clear whether the successful bidder would tow away the vessel, as environmentalists fear ship breaking in-situ at Surathkal would be more hazardous.

373,2020/01/12,Will the sequencing of the Indian cobra genome help in discovering broad-based antivenoms?,"The story so far: A consortium of scientists, which includes several of them from India, has mapped the genome of the Indian cobra considered to be among the most poisonous. Few snakes have had their genomes sequenced in detail and less so for a species of India. The Indian cobra genome sequencing is reportedly the most detailed blueprint of a snake’s genes.

What does sequencing a cobra genome mean?

The Indian cobra, common cobra, spectacled cobra are names for the same species, Naja naja, and is part of the so called ‘Big 4’: the Indian cobra, the common krait (Bungarus caeruleus), Russell’s viper, and the saw-scaled viper. The quartet has long been considered responsible for most snake bites on the Indian subcontinent. The king cobra (Ophiophagus hannah), another poisonous snake, had its genome sequenced in 2013 by a research team in the U.K. (along with an international team). The foray into the Indian cobra genome involved making a map of its 38 chromosomes. Chromosomes are where DNA is tightly packed and the reptile’s gene map — unveiled in the latest issue of the scientific journal, Nature Genetics — revealed over 12,000 genes. The human genome, in comparison, has 23 chromosomes and the estimated number of protein coding genes in the 20,000-25,000 range.

Why is this useful?

Knowing the sequence of genes could aid in understanding the chemical constituents of the venom and contribute to development of new antivenom therapies, which have remained practically unchanged for over a century.

According to the World Health Organisation, though the exact number of snake bites is unknown, an estimated 5.4 million people are bitten each year with up to 2.7 million envenomings. Around 81,000 to 1,38000 people die each year because of snake bites, and around three times as many amputations and other permanent disabilities are caused by snakebites annually. Somasekar Seshagiri of the SciGenome Research Foundation, Bengaluru (and the Molecular Biology Department, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, U.S.), who is one of the authors of the study, used the genome and gene expression data from 14 different cobra tissues. Among the genes mapped are 139 toxin genes, or those that produce biological products specific to toxins. Nineteen of them are venom-specific, and expressed only in the venom gland. These are the constituents of venom that cause paralysis, internal bleeding and death associated with snakebite. Knowing these genes, the scientists argue in their paper, can help scientists design new antivenom using recombinant protein technologies. If genomes of more snakes are sequenced, there is a bigger possibility of genes commonly associated with venom production (across snake species) are identified and more broad-spectrum antivenoms are made.

Isn’t antivenom already available for snakebites?

Sequencing a genome is an important step to making antivenom but will not on its own solve the problem of making and supplying enough of the product to address the huge volume and variety of snakebites in India. A study in December by Kartik Sunagar, Assistant Professor at the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, said that though bites from 60 of 270 species of Indian snakes are known to kill or maim, the antivenom now available is effective only against the ‘Big 4’. The study is titled “Beyond the ‘big four’: Venom profiling of the medically important yet neglected Indian snakes reveals disturbing antivenom deficiencies”, published in the journal, PLOS Neglected Tropical Disease. For instance, the monocled cobra (Naja kaouthia), found in east and north-east India, is not among the ‘Big 4’, but its venom, tested in mice, is more potent than that of the Indian cobra. But the commercial antivenom is not effective against the monocled cobra. Sunagar’s research also shows that the antivenom is effective against the common krait in south India but is not against the same species in Punjab. His study also notes that while various medically important species of cobras (N. sagittifera, N. oxiana, N. kaouthia), kraits (B. andamanensis, B. fasciatus, B. niger, B. sindanus), vipers (Hypnale hypnale, Ovophis monticola, E.c. sochureki, Macrovipera labetina), coral snakes (Calliophis nigrescens, Sinomicrurus macclellandi), sea snakes (Pelamis platurus, Enhydrina schistose, Hydrophis cyanocinctus) and sea kraits (Laticauda colubrina), etc., are capable of delivering clinically significant and, even, fatal bites, specific antivenoms do not exist. This is because snake venom is surprisingly varied and comes in a staggering variety that has not been completely understood by scientists.

How is antivenom made?

Antivenom is made by extracting venom from the snake and injecting small amounts into rabbits or horses. In the case of the polyvalent antivenom available in India, it is made by injecting it into horses. The antibodies that form are then collected from the domestic animal’s blood, purified and isolated. The first antivenom for snakes was actually made for the Indian cobra by Léon Charles Albert Calmette, a French scientist of the Pasteur Institute, in 1894. The process is considered laborious, expensive and time consuming. Using recombinant technology, the genetic sequence for each toxin can be pasted into a yeast or E. coli bacterium, and have them multiply. Then they can be compared to libraries of human antibodies to check which ones stick best and make stable antivenom.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/1g8axz/article30545454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THiStock-1174373088,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/indian-cobra-genome-mapped/article30545455.ece
