1,2020/01/06,Sindhu aims to start year on a high,"Since the World Championship win, P.V. Sindhu hasn’t had a great run and the ace shuttler will look to put that behind her and start the new year on a high when she begins her campaign at the Malaysia Masters Super 500 tournament, here on Tuesday.

Early exits

Sindhu made early exits in the rest of the season since becoming the World champion and also failed to defend the World Tour Finals crown in December.

Sixth-ranked Sindhu should ease past Russia’s Evgeniya Kosetskaya in the first round and the Indian will look to stay on course for an expected meeting with World No. 1 Tai Tzu Ying of Chinese Taipei in the quarterfinals.

Saina Nehwal, who also endured a lean patch last year since winning the Indonesia Masters, will open against a qualifier at the Axiata Arena.

B. Sai Praneeth will meet Thailand’s Kantaphon Wangcharoen in the first round.

Former World No. 6 P. Kashyap will face top seed and World No. 1 Kento Momota of Japan in the first round, while H.S. Prannoy, who was down with health issues for the most part of last season, will meet Japan“s Kanta Tsuneyama.

K. Srikanth will take on Chou Tien Chen of Taiwan.

Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, who became the first Indian men’s pair to claim a super 500 title at the Thailand Open and also reached the final of the French Open Super 750 event, will lock horns with Ong Yew Sin and Teo Ee Yi.

8,2020/01/06,ATP Cup | Nadal on song as Spain sails; Djokovic back to dominant best,"An ominous Rafael Nadal was in cruise control for Spain at the ATP Cup on Monday but Serbia’s Novak Djokovic was forced to sweat through brutal conditions for his second win in a row.

Spanish World No. 1 Nadal swept past Uruguay’s Pablo Cuevas 6-2, 6-1 in just 73 minutes in Perth to ensure his country won a second consecutive tie and moved closer to the quarterfinals.

Djokovic was given a testing workout in his opening clash in Brisbane on Saturday by big-serving South African Kevin Anderson.

He was back to his dominant best against France’s Gael Monfils, but the sapping heat and humidity made the win hard.

10,2020/01/06,Dev Javia focused on pro circuit,"The biggest temptation for any good junior tennis player in the country is to get admission in one of the American universities and ensure a secure career. A few like Mahesh Bhupathi, Somdev Devvarman, Sanam Singh or Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan returned from the good life of the US to excel in the professional circuit.

When Somdev opted to study in the US and pursue his tennis along with it, after having won the men’s ITF Futures title on clay when he was 17 years old, many felt that he was being sucked by the urge of a secure career.

Somdev proved his hunger for tennis by winning back to back NCAA singles titles, beating no less than the towering John Isner in one final.

However, no Indian player from American universities has had such success as Somdev, who won the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games gold medals, apart from reaching a career best rank of 62.

Steadfast

In such a scenario, 17-year-old Dev Javia, ranked junior No. 54 in the world on Monday, has steadfastly countered his parents’ recommendation of pursuing his tennis along with his education in the US.

The good thing is that Somdev is in touch with the talented left-hander and his parents to ensure the best possible guidance at this crucial juncture.

“Dev did work in the camp with us. He did well. If he takes the right steps, he could be really good,” said Somdev, who recently conducted a training camp in Chennai.

He may not have a big build but Dev is a delight to watch on a tennis court. He can construct the points well and be explosive with his serve and strokes when required.

Dependable guide

Groomed from a young age by coach Shrimal Bhatt in Ahmedabad, Dev has found a dependable guide in coach Stephen Koon at the Impact Tennis Academy in Thailand.

“I have put in the hours, as I got good time to work on my fitness as well as my game. We have two weeks before the grade-1 tournament in Australia, followed by the Australian Open. I should be ready by that time, and hopefully perform well,” said Dev, when contacted at his training base in Bangkok.

Dev is pretty clear in his mind that he would compete in the juniors to get the Grand Slam experience, but start competing among the men from this year to form a strong base.

“I have some goals to achieve in men’s circuit this year. But, I am looking to develop myself, doing the right things, surrounded by right people. This year is crucial for me. So, I have to stay fit and improve my game, to compete at higher levels,” said Dev.

11,2020/01/06,Ashleigh Barty donating Brisbane winnings to wildfire relief,"Ash Barty was flying home across Australia following the Fed Cup final when she saw the early signs of devastation from the wildfires that are still raging in large parts of the vast island continent. So the problem hasn’t just dawned on her, the highest-profile tennis star in Australia, like it may have for some players arriving for the season-opening events. But the scale and gravity of the situation is really hitting home.

Barty went to a nearby animal shelter after she returned from the Fed Cup loss to France in Perth last November and donated money, because at that stage animals were the main casualties of the flames. Now, with Australia in the grip of its worst wildfire season in recorded history and with a human death toll of 24, she’s joining the fundraising for a bigger relief effort.

The No. 1-ranked Barty is donating any prize money she wins at the Brisbane International, her home tournament, to the Australian Red Cross for the recovery effort. The winner of the tournament, which starts Monday, will earn more than $250,000.

""It’s been really terrible, it really has. For me this started two or three months ago,” Barty said of the damage caused by what Australians commonly call bush fires. “We have to remember, this has been going on for a long time across our whole country. The first I saw of it was actually flying home ... to the east coast and we could see some of the smoke and some of the fires.

""Obviously the worst of it is still out there at the moment. Now it’s not just the wildlife, it’s also affected Australians with their lives and their homes.”

Actors, athletes, entertainers and everyday citizens have committed millions of dollars in pledges to the relief effort, and organizers of sports events are setting up fundraising events. Australian Open organizers will hold a special charity event on Jan. 15, five days before the season’s first major begins in Melbourne.

Nick Kyrgios was among the first tennis players to pledge, promising 200 Australian dollars for every ace he hits this month. He served 20 in Australia’s opening win at the ATP Cup.

Barty, who started her rise to No. 1 with a run to the quarterfinals at the last Australian Open and then won her first major title at the French Open, will also be a familiar face in the fundraising campaign.

While the fires have mobilized athletes and sports administrators, conditions have also caused concerns about health and safety for players, particularly in tennis and cricket which are such a big part of the Australian summer.

Seven-time Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic is among those who’ve talked about the possible effects of the wildfires on the season-opening major, suggesting the start may even have to be delayed if the air-quality around Melbourne.

Barty said most players would agree the timing of the tennis was less important than safety. ""First and foremost, the reason that there is smoke in the air is what’s most devastating at the moment for our country,” she said. “It’s just a really tough time. Tennis is a sport, it’s a game that we play, and there are certainly a lot of bigger things going on in Australia right now that we need to take care of.

""So, I mean, if it meant that we were delayed by a day or two ... it really doesn’t matter. What matters is that Australians stay safe and we kind of sort out the bigger issues.”

Tennis “is a game that we love, yes, and we try and be the ultimate professionals and do everything that we can, but it is a game. You need to put things into perspective and worry about the bigger things in life first.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/467stm/article30493393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TENNIS-WTAFINALS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ashleigh-barty-donating-brisbane-winnings-to-wildfire-relief/article30493394.ece
12,2020/01/06,"Serena Williams, Caroline Wozniacki win 1st doubles match","They’re friends, they’re former World No. 1s in singles and on Monday they became doubles partners for the first time as Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki teamed to win a first round match at the ASB Classic in Auckland.

Williams and Wozniacki overwhelmed Japan’s Nao Hibino and Mikoto Ninomiya 6-2, 6-4 in a match which was both historic and poignant.

The pair jointly have won 24 Grand Slam titles and 102 WTA singles titles. Williams additionally has won 23 doubles titles, including 13 Gran Slam and three Olympic titles, mostly in partnership with sister Venus.

Serena hasn’t played doubles with anyone other than Venus since 2015 and last played a WTA tournament with anyone other than Venus in 2002.

Wozniacki hasn’t played doubles at all in the last three years. But the pair have long harbored a desire to take the court as a doubles pairing and on Monday they took what may be their last opportunity to do so.

Wozniacki is playing the Auckland tournament for the sixth-straight year as a prelude to the Australian Open after which she will retire from competitive tennis. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis shortly after winning at Melbourne Park in 2018 and has decided to make the Australian Open her last professional tournament before retirement.

Wozniacki and Williams will face each other one last time in an exhibition match in Copehagen in May which will be Wozniacki’s tennis farewell.

On Monday the pair formed a relaxed and intuitive combination, laughing and exchanging high-fives as they swept past Hibino and Ninomiya in 70 minutes.

“It was so much fun, I really enjoyed that,” Wozniacki said. “I’ve been around for a long time and to get to play with Serena was amazing. “It wouldn’t be the same if I didn’t at least once get to play with her on the same side. “She’s beaten me a lot of times on the other side so it’s actually nice that we can win together for once.”

Williams added “it doesn’t seem like she hasn’t played in a long time because she played unbelievable. It’s cool. I can’t let the rest of both of our amazing careers go without playing with her. With her doing so well as a Grand Slam champion and a long-time No, 1 for so long, of course I want to share the court with her.”

Earlier, American teenager Coco Gauff beat Slovakia’s Viktoria Kuzmova 6-3, 6-1 in 61 minutes to stay on course for a quarterfinal meeting with Williams.

13,2020/01/06,How tech geeks battled it out at Ramco Systems’ hackathon event,"Twenty-four hours. That is all you have to solve a complex problem statement. Given the stipulated amount of time, how many layers of code can you construct? At the outset, it seems a gruelling task. Well, not for the third-year Computer Science students of SSN Engineering College, whose team RM-RF — a command operation, if executed, kills the entire system on Lynx — killed the recently-concluded coding marathon, Lord of the Codes, hosted by Ramco Systems.

Code wars

Like any typical hackathon event, participants were presented with industrial-level problem statements — in this case, four scenarios: supercool workspace, automatic work measurement, smart grid concept and frictionless customer experience in a retail outlet. The latter was a test case that was given directly by McDonald’s to Ramco Systems, and it was a case for which RM-RF designed an almost error-free prototype. “As a company, what do we gain by conducting hackathon events? The idea is to give them complex scenarios, which we ourselves might have solutions for. Since most of them are college students, the only criterion with which we evaluate is whether or not they are able to think out of the box,” says Harsh Vardhan, head of Digital Enterprise Business, Ramco Systems.

Over 120 participants, divided into 30 teams consisting of not more than four in a team, were seated in two zones. They were made available with various services — a chirapsia massage, a cafeteria and a shower room — at their disposal. Internet access was provided and they can refer any number of sites, except a few — which were under scrutiny for plagiarism. All the coders needed to do was this: come up with solutions that are both creative and innovative. The coding session was flagged off on January 4 at 12 pm. Which means that when the clock struck 12 pm on January 5, they were expected to share three components: application deliverables, code files and a power-point presentation, explaining the workflow of their models.

Syntax to success

When the members of RM-RF flipped through their test case, they almost had a brain fade moment — the situation wasn’t any different with other teams. They had to engineer a business model for retail automation. For instance, if a food company is flooded with requests beyond their limit in a particular area, especially when other outlets are ready to serve customers, then how do they optimise requests? In layman’s language, how do you balance the load between multiple outlets, so that each one of them works efficiently without hiccups? “We were completely blank at first. We thought of taking the usual route and presenting statistical analysis. But what if the solution we provide was unique? We wanted to provide a service which anybody can use. That is how we started developing our algorithm,” says Kandavel A, one of the members of RM-RF.

They spent seven hours on research, following which, the team brainstormed on effective solutions for real-time issues. “Firstly, we segregated shops based on load requests and our algorithm was smart enough to balance this. So, when you insert our code to your system, it will optimise requests and route it evenly,” says Mohanasundar M, who wrote the algorithm with Kandavel, while Pooja S took care of the web application and Sujin K developed an android application.

Test of language

While the first few hours involved them roaming around, talking to people, figuring out the structure, Mohanasundar says they started hammering the keyboard around 10 pm on January 4. But they met with one critical challenge: cutting down cost. “When you order something from a service provider (like Swiggy), it sends requests to every single outlet. We had to figure out a way to cut down ETA (expected time arrival),” explains Kandavel, adding something about how API requests work; the very reason why this writer chose to make a career in journalism.

Pooja, on the other hand, credited volunteers from Ramco for offering insights into design issues and sharing hints. “We cached data from users placing requests from a particular area. We used that data to find the nearest outlet, thereby cutting cost,” she says, adding, “We ran out of test cases after a point. So, when it was time for presentation, we challenged the jury members to present a problem and we solved it live.” Over 24 jury members, who are domain experts, were brought in for evaluation. “All of them were judged on three basic criteria: technical architecture, innovation and articulation. Based on these, they were rated on a scale of five,” says Prince Sudersanam, vice president, ERP Product Development, Ramco Systems, about the selection process.

“Right from the start, we were sure of cracking the code. All we had to do was to sacrifice sleep,” says Mohanasundar. The effort was worth it...for they bagged the first place with a cash prize of ₹50,000.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/society/1kfj9n/article30494242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07MPHack2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/thinking-in-java/article30494245.ece
14,2020/01/06,Amazon’s Cloud arm to speed up drone innovation in India,"The Drone Federation of India (DFI) on Monday announced to make Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its preferred Cloud service to boost the development and to innovate around the drone ecosystem in the country.

The not-for-profit industry body will work with Amazon’s Cloud arm to help provide a scalable, agile and secure Cloud infrastructure for drone manufacturers, application developers and operators to develop drone applications and accelerate time-to-market in India.

“AWS was a natural choice for us, which will help drone manufacturers and developers as its Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities, open data sets and technical prowess are simply unmatched,” Rahat Kulshreshtha, President, DFI, said.

The industry body signed an MoU with AWS at the ‘Drone Festival of India 2020’ here.

The collaboration will identify use cases for drones in India across various application areas such as land survey, precision agriculture, disaster management, and search and rescue missions, and build custom cloud-based solutions.

According to Rahul Sharma, President, India and South Asia Public Sector, Amazon Internet Services Pvt. Ltd (AISPL), verticals like agriculture, healthcare, smart cities etc will see massive drone deployment in months to come.

“AWS Open Data sets with granularity will let drone developers innovate further and deeper. With industry—leading compute, storage, database, IoT, AI and L, drone developers and operators can now test new ideas quickly, and accelerate innovation,” Mr. Sharma said.

India currently has nearly 100 drone startups and the autonomous drone aviation industry has great potential ahead, stressed Mr. Kulshreshtha.

Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5

It’s a new year and a new generation of gaming consoles awaits us. In 2020, we can get our hands on the much-awaited Xbox Series X and the PlayStation 5. Both consoles have the latest custom chips from AMD, using the new Zen 2 architecture. They will support ray tracing, will almost nullify loading time and enable 4K viewing. The Xbox Series X, which will be released towards the end of the year, differs from its predecessors in terms of design and name. Meanwhile, PlayStation 5, which will come with the new Dual Shock 5 controller, will have better haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.

Cyberpunk 2077

Without a doubt, the most anticipated games in this list come from the studio that brought you last decade’s best role-playing game, The Witcher 3. Cyberpunk 2077 has been in development since 2012 and now it’s going to be out in April 2020. Set in a dystopian futuristic city, the first-person shooter game has a special focus on hacking and mechanical augmentations. With stunning graphics, the makers have constructed a world that reminds one of Grand Theft Auto and Blade Runner. And, if all that didn’t excite you, the game has Keanu Reeves in it!

Capcom is riding on a high, after their masterful remake of Resident Evil 2. To satiate the fans’ hunger, another remake, Resident Evil 3, is on its way. It will see Jill Valentine trying to escape Raccoon City, with a bioweapon known as Nemesis hot on her heels.

Watch Dogs: Legion

Set in a post-Brexit Great Britain, Watch Dogs: Legion lets you play as anyone. The challenge is to start a resistance in the age of surveillance. The game lets you scout, recruit and play as people of interest and take on several missions to save London from dystopia.

Microsoft Flight Simulator

It has been a while since you’ve seen that name up in gaming lists, yet every look at Microsoft’s new Flight Simulator, makes us want it more. What makes this game so special is that it uses Bing Maps to simulate our entire planet. It features realistic cities all mapped out — terrain, water and almost all airports for you to land in. If that wasn’t impressive, then, the game features some of the most beautiful photo-realistic graphics. One of the best ways of getting high in 2020.

U.S. officials are due to give an update on the situation after Washington killed Qasem Soleimani, head of Iran’s Middle East operations as commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike at Baghdad airport.

“The North Atlantic Council will address the situation in the region,” a NATO official said.

“The secretary general decided to convene the meeting of NATO ambassadors following consultations with allies.”

Mr. Stoltenberg had spoken by telephone with U.S. Secretary of Defence Mark Esper since Friday’s strike, but the killing of Mr. Soleimani surprised many of Washington’s allies and triggered calls for de-escalation.

The situation has also deteriorated in Iraq, where lawmakers have called for the 5,200 U.S. soldiers deployed there to leave.

NATO maintains a 500-strong training mission in Iraq, preparing local forces to take on Islamic State group extremists, but this would be in doubt if coalition forces pull out.

“The big issue is the future of the NATO mission in Iraq after the demand of the Iraqi parliament yesterday to remove U.S.-led coalition and foreign forces. We have to see what we will do now,” a NATO diplomat said.

On Saturday, a NATO spokesman said the mission, which involves several hundred allied personnel, was continuing “but training activities are currently suspended”.

Another diplomat said the alliance would have to “wait and see” how Baghdad responds in the coming days.

“From our point of view the parliament resolution is not binding. We take note of it, but have to wait what the government is going to do,” the diplomat said.

“We still think that the presence of international troops in Iraq should be continued in order to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State. But we have to respect what the Iraqi government will eventually decide.”

Tehran has vowed to avenge the commander, and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened “major retaliation” if any American targets are hit.

Britain, France and Germany issued a joint statement late on Sunday urging Iran to “refrain from further violent action or proliferation” and criticising the “negative role” Tehran played in the Middle East through Soleimani’s forces.

Iran was also warned not to flout the 2015 nuclear deal, which Washington pulled out of in 2018, after announcing further steps away from the beleaguered accord.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nato-panels-to-review-iraq-mission-after-iran-general-slain/article30496356.ece

U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday stood by his threat to go after Iranian cultural sites, warning of a “major retaliation” if Iran strikes back for the killing of one of its top military commanders.

The U.N. cultural body said that under provisions of the 1954 and 1972 conventions — which have been ratified by both the United States and Iran — signatory states undertake not to take any deliberate measures which might damage cultural and natural heritage on the territory of other states party to those conventions.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4vnaba/article30495779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRANCULTURALSITES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/unesco-says-us-signed-treaties-not-to-harm-cultural-heritage/article30495780.ece
20,2020/01/06,"U.S.-Iran unrest: Weeping, Iran Supreme Leader prays over general slain by U.S.","Weeping amid wails from a crowd of hundreds of thousands of mourners, Iran’s Supreme Leader on Monday prayed over the remains of a top Iranian general killed in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad, an attack that’s drastically raised tensions between Tehran and Washington.

The targeted killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani already has seen his replacement vow to take revenge. Additionally, Tehran has abandoned the remaining limits of its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers in response to the slaying while in Iraq, the Parliament has called for the expulsion of all American troops from Iraqi soil.

Explained: Is West Asia headed for war?

The developments could bring Iran closer to building an atomic bomb, set off a proxy or military attack launched by Tehran against America and enable the Islamic State group to stage a comeback in Iraq, making the Middle East a far more dangerous and unstable place.

Adding to the tensions, President Donald Trump threatened to demand billions of dollars in compensation from Iraq or impose “sanctions like they’ve never seen before” if it goes through with expelling U.S. troops.

Soleimani’s daughter, Zeinab, directly threatened an attack on the U.S. military in the Mideast while speaking to a crowd of hundreds of thousands in Tehran that stretched as far as the eye could see. Iranian state TV put the crowd size at “millions,” though that number could not be verified.

“The families of the American soldiers in western Asia ... will spend their days waiting for the death of their children,” she said to cheers. Iranian state television and others online shared a video that showed Mr. Trump’s American flag tweet following Soleimani’s killing turn into a coffin, the “likes” of the tweet replaced by over 1,43,000 “killed” with the hashtag #severerevenge.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei himself prayed over the caskets of Soleimani and others slain in the attack. Mr. Khamenei, who had a close relationship with Soleimani, wept at one point during the traditional Muslim prayers for the dead. The crowd wailed.

Soleimani’s successor, Esmail Ghaani stood near Mr. Khamenei’s side, as did Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and other top leaders in the Islamic Republic. While Iran recently faced nationwide protests over government-set gasoline prices that reportedly killed over 300 people, Soleimani’s mass processionals has seen politicians and leaders across the Islamic Republic’s political spectrum take part, temporarily silencing that anger.

Demonstrators burned Israeli and U.S. flags, carried a flag-draped U.S. coffin or effigies of Mr. Trump. Some described Mr. Trump himself as a legitimate target for Iran’s revenge.

Mohammad Milad Rashidi, a 26-year-old university graduate, predicted more tension ahead.

“Trump demolished the chance for any sort of possible agreement between Tehran and Washington,” Mr. Rashidi said. “There will be more conflict in the future for sure.”

Mr. Ghaani made his own threat in an interview with Iranian state television aired Monday. “God the Almighty has promised to get his revenge, and God is the main avenger. Certainly actions will be taken,” he said.

Markets reacted Monday to the tensions, sending international benchmark Brent crude above $70 a barrel. The Middle East remains a crucial source of oil and Iran in the past has threatened the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all the world’s oil traded passes.

Mr. Ghaani, a longtime Soleimani deputy, has now taken over as the head of the Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, an expeditionary arm of the paramilitary organisation answerable only to Mr. Khamenei. Mr. Ghaani has been sanctioned by the U.S. since 2012 for his work funding its operations around the world, including its work with proxies in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

Those proxies likely will be involved in any operation targeting U.S. interests in the Mideast or elsewhere in the world.

Already, the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia warned Americans “of the heightened risk of missile and drone attacks.” In Lebanon, the leader of the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah said Soleimani’s killing made U.S. military bases, warships and service members across the region fair game for attacks. A former Iranian Revolutionary Guard leader suggested the Israeli city of Haifa and others could be targeted should the U.S. attack Iran.

“We promise to continue down martyr Soleimani’s path as firmly as before with help of God, and in return for his martyrdom we aim to get rid of America from the region,” Mr. Ghaani said.

The head of the Guard’s aerospace program, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, suggested Iran’s response wouldn’t stop with a single attack.

“Firing a couple of missiles, hitting a base or even killing Trump is not valuable enough to compensate for martyr Soleimani’s blood,” Mr. Hajizadeh said on state TV. “The only thing that can compensate for his blood is the complete removal of America from the region and taking away their evil from the oppressed people of the region.”

On the nuclear deal, Iranian state television cited Sunday a statement by Mr. Rouhani’s administration saying the country would not observe the nuclear deal’s restrictions on fuel enrichment, on the size of its enriched uranium stockpile and on its research and development activities.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson specifically urged Iran to “withdraw all measures” not in line with the 2015 agreement that was intended to stop Tehran from pursuing its atomic weapons program.

Iran insisted that it remains open to negotiations with European partners over its nuclear program. And it did not back off from earlier promises that it wouldn’t seek a nuclear weapon.

Iran did not elaborate on what levels it would immediately reach in its program. Tehran has already broken some of the deal’s limits as part of a step-by-step pressure campaign to get sanctions relief. It already has increased its production, begun enriching uranium to 5% and restarted enrichment at an underground facility.

While it does not possess uranium enriched to weapons-grade levels of 90%, any push forward narrows the estimated one-year “breakout time” needed for it to have enough material to build a nuclear weapon if it chose to do so.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations watchdog observing Iran’s program, did not respond to a request for comment. However, Iran said that its cooperation with the IAEA “will continue as before.”

Soleimani’s killing has escalated the crisis between Tehran and Washington after months of back-and-forth attacks and threats that have put the wider Middle East on edge. Iran has promised “harsh revenge” while Mr. Trump has vowed on Twitter that the U.S. will strike back at 52 targets “VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. “

""They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way,” Mr. Trump told reporters.

The processions for Soleimani mark the first time Iran honoured a single man with a multi-city ceremony. Not even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Islamic Republic, received such a processional with his death in 1989.

21,2020/01/06,"Over 1,000 protest in Bangladesh after student is raped","More than 1,000 students and activists on Monday linked their hands, chanted slogans and marched through Bangladesh’s main public university after a second-year student was raped, police said.

The protesters gathered on the campus in Dhaka, the capital, after the victim was rescued and taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital around midnight on Sunday.

The victim was walking to a friend’s place after getting off a university bus on Sunday evening, but someone grabbed her from behind, gagged her and took her to an empty place nearby, where she was attacked, police said.

The protesters chanted slogans demanding the arrest of whoever was responsible and safety for women. Some carried festoons reading, “No more rape, we want justice” and “We want the highest punishment.”

Kazi Sahan Haque, Police Chief at Kurmitola Police Station, said authorities recorded a case filed by the victim’s father and were investigating.

In Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority conservative nation of 160 million people, women regularly face various forms of harassment including rape and tortures.

22,2020/01/06,"Philippines braces to evacuate its workers in Iraq, Iran","Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the military to prepare to deploy its aircraft and ships “at any moment’s notice” to evacuate thousands of Filipino workers in Iraq and Iran, reflecting Asia’s growing fears for its citizens amid a potential outbreak of violence in the Middle East.

Other Asian nations with large populations of expatriate labour may face similar decisions amid the rapidly escalating tensions between the United States and Iran following last week’s U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.

South Korean government ministries have discussed strengthening protections for the nearly 1,900 South Koreans in Iraq and Iran. India’s Foreign Ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said India wasn’t planning to evacuate any citizens from the volatile region “yet.”

Explained: Is West Asia headed for war?

Mr. Duterte held an emergency meeting with his Defence Secretary and top military and police officials Sunday to discuss the evacuation plans.

“President Duterte ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to be prepared to deploy military assets to repatriate overseas Filipinos in the Middle East, particularly from Iran and Iraq, at any moment’s notice,” said Sen. Christopher Lawrence Go, a close ally of Mr. Duterte who was at the meeting.

Iran has vowed to retaliate and President Donald Trump warned American forces would hit back at 52 Iranian targets if Americans come under attack. Iraq’s Parliament has also called for the expulsion of all American troops from Iraqi soil, which could revive the Islamic State group in Iraq, making the Middle East a far more dangerous and unstable place.

Compounding contingency plans is the uncertainty where hostilities could possibly break out.

Military Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Felimon Santos Jr. said Philippine forces have identified possible evacuation routes not only in Iraq and Iran but other hotspots, like Israel.

“There are probabilities like that and we are improving our plans just to cover everything just in case something happens,” Mr. Santos told presspersons in Manila.

Other countries face similar dilemmas. Asians make up 40% of the world’s migrants, and Middle Eastern countries are a common destination. African migrants are also employed around the Middle East, though the possibility of their home countries arranging evacuations was uncertain.

Gulf Arab states are home to more than 7 million Indian expatriates who help drive the region’s economy and keep its cities teeming with doctors, engineers, teachers, drivers, construction workers and other labourers. In United Arab Emirates, Indians outnumber Emiratis three to one.

South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said on Monday that government agencies had discussed preparations for an escalating crisis in the Middle East but had no immediate plans for evacuations. The Ministry said about 1,600 South Koreans are in Iraq, mostly working in construction, while another 280 who live in Iran are businesspeople, students or spouses of Iranians.

On past occasions, China has evacuated its citizens from other countries during times of conflict, political tension or natural disaster. In 2015, the navy transported nearly 500 Chinese out of war-torn Yemen. It evacuated 3,000 from Vietnam in 2014, after the deployment of a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters elicited a wave of anti-China riots.

There are more than 7,000 Filipino workers and their dependents in Iraq and Iran, including many who work in U.S. and other foreign facilities and commercial establishments in Baghdad, the Department of National Defence said.

The workers in Iran and Iraq are a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos who are employed in countries lining the Persian Gulf.

23,2020/01/06,Koala mittens and joey pouches: Australian bushfires spark global knitting frenzy,"Knitting needles are clicking furiously around the world to create hundreds of protective pouches and blankets for native wildlife made homeless by Australian wildfires that have razed large swathes of bushland.

The Animal Rescue Craft Guild said on Monday it has been deluged with offers of help after putting out a call for volunteers to make bat wraps, joey pouches, birds nests, possum boxes, koala mittens and other snuggly homes for marsupials.

Donations to the volunteer-run group have come in from as far afield as the United States, Britain, Hong Kong, France and Germany.

“It’s been going crazy,” Belinda Orellana, a founding member of the guild, told Reuters. “The response has been amazing.”

Blazes across Australia in recent weeks have scorched through 8 million hectares of bushland, an area the size of Austria.

Some experts estimates put the number of animals, including domestic pets and livestock, killed as high as half a billion, with potentially hundreds of thousands of injured and displaced native wildlife.

“It’s the poor little souls that survived where we come in,” said Ms. Orellana. “Our group creates and supplies items to rescue groups and carers around the country who take in and care for the wildlife.”

Ms. Orellana said the guild supplied thousands of rescue groups around the country and demand was growing, adding there was urgent need for fabric donations.

Originally formed a few months ago to make dog and cat beds and coats for animal pounds, the guild’s Facebook page has 75,000 members. Many of the crafters have crocheted, knitted and sewed a range of items including koala mittens for burned paws and pouches for infant “joey” kangaroos who have lost their mothers.

Lara Mackay, a new volunteer who lives in New Zealand, has just made her first makeshift joey pouch, which she enlisted her cat to test out at home.

“I'm planning to make as many as possible and am asking fabric outlets for fabric donations to sew,” Ms. Mackay told Reuters.

In Singapore, Leslie Kok was working on her fourth joey pouch and meeting up with other volunteers to share materials and tips.

“I will knit as long as there is a need for the pouches,” Ms. Kok said.

Closer to the fires, Simone Watts in the Blue Mountains outside of Sydney, saw the plea for help and set to work turning pillow cases into beds for bats or flying foxes.

“I looked at the list of what is most needed versus my fairly basic sewing capability and decided I could contribute the bat wraps,” Ms. Watts said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/d56m0w/article30484075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TOPSHOT-AUSTRALIA-FIRE-ANIMAL-KOALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/koala-mittens-and-joey-pouches-australian-bushfires-spark-global-knitting-frenzy/article30492206.ece
24,2020/01/06,German police kill man who approached them with knife,"Police in western Germany shot and killed a 37-year-old man who allegedly tried to attack them with a knife. They are checking whether extremism was a possible motive for the attack, the German news agency dpa reported Monday.

The man, whose name was not given, first used an unidentified object to attack a police car in front of a precinct in Gelsenkirchen Sunday night, and then approached officers with the item in his hand, police spokesman Christopher Grauwinkel said.

As the man came toward the officers, they saw that he had a knife in his other hand and did not stop despite several orders to do so. A 27-year-old police officer then fatally shot him, dpa said.

25,2020/01/06,Australia bushfire crisis: PM Morrison announces $2 billion for relief support,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday announced an additional 2 billion dollars over two years to a new agency to coordinate a national response to rebuild communities and livelihoods following the deadly bushfire crisis.

The National Bushfire Recovery Agency, headed by former federal police chief Andrew Colvin, will help bushfire affected communities recover.

The agency would be funded with an initial 2 billion Australian dollars (USD 1.38 billion) to ensure the families, farmers and business owners hit by the unprecedented bushfires would get the support they needed as they recover, the Prime Minister said.

“It’s a long road ahead and we will be with these communities every step of the way as they rebuild,” Morrison, who is facing widespread criticism in Australia for his handling of the crisis, said.

The bushfire crisis has taken a heavy toll with more than 1,500 homes already lost throughout the course of this fire season, which has been running since September, according to the government.

Over 20 people have lost their lives so far.

In pictures: Fire continues to devastate Australia

“While the immediate focus for our emergency services and the Australian Defence Force is keeping people safe and defending against the fires hitting so many areas, we also need to be ready to hit the ground in communities where the fire-front has passed to help them rebuild.

“The agency will ensure the work of state and territory governments is being supported and act as a ‘one stop shop’ central team to coordinate the response. We will do whatever it takes,” he said.

Meanwhile fire continued to burn across several regions of the country including New South Wales and Victoria which on Monday received some relief following rain.

Commissioner of New South Wales Rural Fire Service Shane Fitzsimmons confirmed that nearly 150 fires were still burning across the state.

“We are certainly seeing an easing of conditions right across the state. And as a matter of fact, there’s even a bit of drizzle happening down here on the south coast. And it’s certainly a welcome reprieve,” he said, adding that “’unfortunately it is not putting out the fires. It’s not helping us with the furthering of the work of back burning and consolidation work“.

“All our fires are now off the emergency warning alert level. We’ve got nine at the watch and act alert level, which is indicative of ongoing fire behaviour and potential and fire still burning in and around lots of communities. There’s lots of damage and destruction,” he said.

In Victoria, all emergency warnings statewide were downgraded following rain however a total of 15 ‘watch and act’ warnings remained in place for the state.

No Victorians were now unaccounted for because of bushfires, according to latest confirmation by state Premier Daniel Andrews who also announced a new bushfire relief agency for the state.

In South Australia, the bushfire on Kangaroo Island was still uncontrolled, burning at ‘watch and act’ level.

Earlier, the fire had killed two people, burnt about a third of the Island and is believed to have killed approximately half of the Island’s Koala population.

The Mayor of Kangaroo Island said he knows at least 50 homes that have been destroyed.

Water and power infrastructure has been significantly damaged in the island’s west. Repair estimates are not yet known.

Almost six million hectares have burned in Australia in the ongoing bushfire crisis, with over 20 deaths reported so far.

On Saturday, Prime Minister Morrison called up 3,000 military reserve troops to combat the bushfires, the first time that reservists were called up in such a large number “in the living memory“.

Mr. Morrison was criticised for taking a family vacation in Hawaii at the start of the wildfire crisis, with many people complaining about the lack of readiness in utilisation of resources.

Last week, he was heckled when he visited a township in New South Wales where houses have been destroyed and one of them belonged to one of the three volunteer firefighters who have died in the crisis.

Over 3,000 firefighters are on the frontline, with 31 specialist strike teams in place across NSW.

26,2020/01/06,China’s PLA begins major military exercises in Tibet,"The Chinese army has begun major military exercises in the high-altitude Tibet bordering India, deploying latest weapons including the Type 15 light battle tank and the new 155-MM vehicle-mounted howitzer, a media report said on Sunday.

The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Tibet Military Command started its New Year exercises in which it has deployed helicopters, armoured vehicles, heavy artillery and anti-aircraft missiles across the region from Lhasa, capital of Tibet, to the border defence front lines with elevations of more than 4,000 metres, state-run Global Times reported.

India-China Line of Actual Control (LAC) covers 3,488 km, including the border along Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet.

Both the tank and howitzer, which were revealed to the public on the National Day military parade on October 1 last year, are specifically designed with advantages for plateau regions and can play important roles in safeguarding border areas, the report said.

Their deployment in the Tibet Military Command will enhance PLA combat capability in the plateau regions, it quoted a military expert as saying.

Both were equipped with powerful engines, enabling them to manoeuvre efficiently in Tibet’s terrains, a military expert was quoted as saying in the report.

Also read: How Ex-Nissan chief jumped $14 million bail to escape to Lebanon

Masako Mori told reporters at a news conference the ministry has already acted to prevent a recurrence but declined to give details.

Ghosn skipped bail while awaiting trial on various financial misconduct allegations and later said from Lebanon that he did to escape injustice.

Mori declined to say who might be responsible for such a high-profile flight, stressing it was still under investigation.

She said Ghosn left illegally, denouncing it as an unjustifiable” crime.

Japan’s justice system allows investigating the facts while it ensures the individual basic human rights at the same time,” Mori said.

It is set with appropriate procedures and it is operated appropriately. So, there is no reason to justify the escape by those on bail.

Details of Ghosn’s stunning escape last week are not yet clear. But Turkish airline company MNG Jet has said two of its planes were used illegally, first flying him from Osaka, Japan, to Istanbul, and then on to Beirut, where he arrived last Monday and has not been seen since.

He promised to talk to reporters Wednesday. His lawyers in Japan said they knew nothing and felt betrayed by his action.

Ghosn, once a superstar of the auto industry, was first arrested in November 2018. He had been out on bail and most recently had lived in a home in an upscale part of Tokyo.

He was under strict surveillance as part of his bail conditions, raising questions about how he left undetected.

Security cameras at his home operated 24 hours a day, but the footage was only required to be submitted to the court monthly, according to lawyers’ documents detailing Ghosn’s bail conditions.

Ghosn had been charged with under-reporting his future compensation and breach of trust in diverting Nissan money for his personal gain. He has repeatedly said he was innocent.

His bail has been revoked, and Interpol had issued a wanted notice. Japan does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon, but Mori left open the possibility Japan could seek Ghosn’s return.

A man shot and killed the officer Sunday morning during a traffic stop at Florence Regional Airport, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said in a news release.

Florence County Coroner Keith von Lutcken identified the victim as Jackson Ryan Winkeler (26), of Dillon, WPDE-TV reported.

The suspect, 37-year-old James Edward Bell, initially fled but was later captured by Florence County deputies, officials said.

Winkeler also volunteered with the Latta Fire Department, which lowered its flag to half staff Sunday.

""He lost his life doing what he loved the most. Helping people. Jackson was one of the best firefighters that you could ever have on a fire scene,” Dillon Count Fire Lt. Nic Bethea told WPDE. “No matter what time of the day it was, Jackson was willing to help.”

The investigation into Winkeler’s slaying is ongoing.

31,2020/01/06,Trump doubles down on striking cultural sites in Iran,"President Donald Trump insisted on Sunday that Iranian cultural sites were fair game for the U.S. military, dismissing concerns within his own administration that doing so could constitute a war crime under international law. He also warned Iraq that he would levy punishing sanctions if it expelled American troops in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad that killed a top Iranian official.

Mr. Trump’s comments came amid escalating tensions in the Middle East following the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds force. Iran has vowed to retaliate and Iraq’s parliament responded by voting Sunday to oust U.S. troops based in the country.

Mr. Trump first raised the prospect of targeting Iranian cultural sites Saturday in a tweet. Speaking with reporters on Sunday as he returned to Washington from his holiday stay in Florida, he doubled down, despite international prohibitions.

""They’re allowed to kill our people. They’re allowed to torture and maim our people. They’re allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we’re not allowed to touch their cultural sites? It doesn’t work that way,” Mr. Trump said.

The targeted killing of Soleimani sparked outrage in the Middle East, including in Iraq, where more than 5,000 American troops are still on the ground 17 years after the U.S. invasion. Iraq’s parliament voted on Sunday in favor of a nonbinding resolution calling for the expulsion of the American forces.

Mr. Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t leave without being paid for its military investments in Iraq over the years - then said if the troops do have to withdraw, he would hit Baghdad with economic penalties.

""We will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame,” he said. “If there’s any hostility, that they do anything we think is inappropriate, we are going to put sanctions on Iraq, very big sanctions on Iraq.”

The administration has scrambled to contend with the backlash to the killing of Soleimani. Though he was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans, the targeted American strike marked a stark escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. military may well strike more Iranian leaders if the Islamic Republic retaliates. He tip-toed around questions about Mr. Trump’s threat to attack Iranian cultural sites, a military action that likely would be illegal under the laws of armed conflict and the U.N. charter.

Mr. Pompeo said only that any U.S. military strikes inside Iran would be legal.

""We’ll behave inside the system,” Mr. Pompeo said. “We always have and we always will.”

Mr. Trump’s warnings rattled some administration officials. One U.S. national security official said the president had caught many in the administration off guard and prompted internal calls for others in the government, including Pompeo, to clarify the matter. The official, who was not authorized to speak publicly to the issue, said clarification was necessary to affirm that the U.S. military would not intentionally commit war crimes.

Oona Hathaway, an international law professor at Yale and a former national security law official in the Defense Department’s legal office, said Mr. Trump’s threat amounted to “a pretty clear promise of commission of a war crime.”

The president’s threats to Iran did little to quell Tehran’s furor over the death of Soleimani. Iranian state television reported that the country would no longer abide by any limits of the 2015 nuclear deal it signed with the United States and other world powers. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the deal in 2018 and stepped up economic sanctions on Tehran - actions that accelerated a cycle of hostilities leading to the last week’s killing.

The administration also pushed back Sunday on questions about the legality of the strike on Soleimani. Mr. Pompeo said the administration would have been “culpably negligent” in its duty to protect the United States if it had not killed him. He did not provide evidence for his previous claims that Soleimani was plotting imminent attacks on Americans. Instead of arguing that an attack had been imminent, he said it was inevitable.

“We watched him continue to actively build out for what was going to be a significant attack that’s what we believed and we made the right decision,” he said, adding later- “We continue to prepare for whatever it is the Iranian regime may put in front of us within the next 10 minutes, within the next 10 days, and within the next 10 weeks.”

Congressional Democrats were skeptical.

""I really worry that the actions the president took will get us into what he calls another endless war in the Middle East. He promised we wouldn’t have that,” said Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate’s top Democrat.

Mr. Schumer said Mr. Trump lacks the authority to engage militarily with Iran and Congress needs a new war powers resolution “to be a check on this president.” To which Mr. Pompeo said- “We have all the authority we need to do what we’ve done to date.”

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said the administration violated the Constitution by not consulting with Congress in advance.

""It’s also important because one, you potentially get members of Congress to buy in ahead of time, and two, they may ask that hard question that’s not asked in an insular group,” Warner said.

Congressional staffs got their first briefings from the administration on Friday, and members were expected to be briefed this week.

But Mr. Trump made clear Sunday that he saw little reason to give Congress advanced warning if he orders the military to carry out further actions against Iran.

""These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner,” he wrote on Twitter. “Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!”

Democrats in Congress have complained that Mr. Trump’s order to kill Soleimani took place without first consulting with or informing top lawmakers, noting that Congress still holds sole power to declare war. Mr. Trump did meet the 48-hour deadline required by the War Powers Act to notify Congress of the deadly drone strike, though the document provided Saturday was entirely classified and no public version was released.

Some of the Democrats running to challenge Trump in November questioned whether he had a long-term plan for the Mideast.

Former Vice President Joe Biden said Trump was ill-prepared for the repercussions of the strike on Soleimani and had alienated allies by not alerting them of the plans. “I think we need a president who could provide steady leadership on Day One,” he said. “The next president is going to inherit a divided nation and a world in disarray.”

Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana. said- “When you’re dealing with the Middle East, you need to think about the next and the next and the next move. This is not checkers. And I’m not sure any of us really believe that this president and the people around him” are “really going through all of the consequences of what could happen next.”

Pompeo appeared on ABC’s “This Week,” CNN’s “State of the Union,” NBC’s “Meet the Press,""’ CBS’ ""Face the Nation,” “Fox News Sunday” and Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” Schumer was on ABC, Warner and Warren were on NBC, Petraeus was on CBS, Buttigieg was on CNN and Graham was on Fox News Channel.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8sc5gu/article30446027.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31IN-TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-doubles-down-on-striking-cultural-sites-in-iran/article30490877.ece
32,2020/01/06,Pakistani Army must stop using terror groups as instruments of foreign policy: Pakistani dissidents,"A group of dissident Pakistanis has expressed deep disappointment over continuous military intervention and abridgement of democratic freedoms in Pakistan and called on mainstream parties to stand up for civilian supremacy, constitutional governance, and rule of law in the country.

The group also demanded that the Pakistan military must put an end to the continuing use of extremist militant groups as instruments of foreign and domestic policy and for that matter treating the western border of the country as the strategic backyard of Pakistan.

Under the banner of South Asians Against Terrorism & For Human Rights (SAATH) Forum, the group that includes Pakistan’s former envoy to the US Hussain Haqqani, said the security agencies must close “torture cells and black sites”, known as internment centres, and either bring cases against thousands of detainees before the regular courts of law to stand trial or release them unconditionally.

“We are also disappointed in Pakistan’s mainstream political parties and their willingness to continuously cede space to military intervention and abridgement of democratic freedoms. These parties must practice internal democracy and acknowledge that democracy is not just seeking office through elections, the SAATH said in a resolution.

“Pakistan’s mainstream political parties must stand up for civilian supremacy, constitutional governance, and rule of law and not be content with power of patronage granted to them through manipulated elections, it said.

The dissident members participated in a fourth edition of the SAATH conference here and also passed the resolution calling for an end to military oppression in Balochistan.

“The security agencies must put an end to enforced disappearances and account for thousands of missing persons and those extra-judicially killed. To that end, there is a dire need for the formation of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to bring closure to the victims of state-sponsored oppression, the resolution said.

Prominent among those who participated included U.S.-based columnist Mohammad Taqi, former Senator Afrasiab Khattak, former Ambassador Kamran Shafi, former editor of Daily Times Rashed Rahman, journalists Taha Siddiqui, Gul Bukhari and Marvi Sirmed and activist Gulalai Ismail.

Earlier SAATH conferences were held in London in 2016 and 2017 and in Washington DC in 2018.

“SAATH 2020 demands that after the merger of erstwhile FATA with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, life shall be returned to normalcy in the erstwhile FATA. The 25th Constitutional Amendment is implemented effectively, and the military should hand over policing to the police department, the resolution said.

SAATH condemns the brutality of the military against the residents of erstwhile FATA after attacks on the military check posts by the militants.

“SAATH recognizes that peace in Pakistan is inextricably linked with peace in Afghanistan and peace in the region. Pakistan should revise its Afghan policy of strategic depth and devise a new policy based on social, economic and academic cooperation between the two countries, the resolution said.

Recognizing that peace in Pakistan is inextricably linked with peace in Afghanistan and peace in the region, the resolution said that Pakistan should revise its Afghan policy of strategic depth and devise a new policy based on social, economic and academic cooperation between the two countries.

The resolution demanded that the CPEC project should be reconsidered in light of the views of the peoples of Gilfit-Baltistan, Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and Sindh.

“As currently conceived, this project benefits China only and seems like a ploy to control valuable natural resources, displace populations, and leave the provinces with irreparable environmental damage, it said.

The resolution also expressed concerns over some of the recent developments in India including the abrogation of Article 370, Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The escalating tensions between the US and Iran in the wake of the assassination of Iranian commander Qasim Soleimani, can potentially threaten destabilisation of the region, the resolution added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/jhhlia/article28184635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Hussain-Haqqani,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistani-army-must-stop-using-terror-groups-as-instruments-of-foreign-policy-pakistani-dissidents/article30490843.ece
33,2020/01/06,Trump says his Twitter posts serve as notification to US Congress about possible Iran strike,"President Donald Trump on Sunday said that his tweets would serve as prior notification to the U.S. Congress if he did decide to strike against Iran again.

“These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly and fully strike back, and perhaps in a disproportionate manner,"" Mr. Trump said in a tweet.

“Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!"" said the President, making it clear that he does not need Congressional approval about his any potential strike against Iran.

Top Democrats such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have criticized the U.S. administration for not consulting with Congress before launching the strike that killed top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.

Pelosi has warned that the U.S. could not “put the lives of American service members, diplomats and others further at risk by engaging in provocative and disproportionate actions.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lt3skw/article30474544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-IRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-says-his-twitter-posts-serve-as-notification-to-congress-about-iran/article30490420.ece
34,2020/01/06,At least two rockets hit near US embassy in Baghdad: witnesses,"Two rockets hit near the U.S. embassy in Iraq’s capital Sunday, witnesses told AFP, hours after the ambassador was summoned over a US strike that killed top Iraqi and Iranian commanders.

Sunday’s attack was the second night in a row that the Green Zone was hit and the 14th time over the last two months that US installations have been targeted.

A third rocket simultaneously hit a family home outside the Green Zone, wounding four, medical sources told AFP.

Ties between Iraq and the US have deteriorated after an American drone attack Friday on the Baghdad international airport that killed Iran’s Major General Qasem Soleimani and top Iraqi military figure Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

The precision strike came just days after a pro-Iran mob attacked the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.

In response on Sunday, Iraq’s parliament called on the government to oust U.S. and other foreign troops from the country.

Some 5,200 U.S. soldiers are stationed across Iraqi bases to support local troops preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State jihadist group.

They are deployed as part of the broader international coalition, invited by the Iraqi government in 2014 to help fight I.S.

Sunday’s rocket attack came hours after a deadline by a hardline group in Iraq’s Hashed al-Shaabi military force, which has close ties to Iran, for Iraqi security forces to “get away” from US troops at joint bases across Iraq.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/r4cpyi/article30481272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GREENZONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/at-least-two-rockets-hit-near-us-embassy-in-baghdad-witnesses/article30489985.ece
35,2020/01/06,Iran abandons nuclear deal limits after US kills general,"Iran said on Sunday it would no longer abide by any of the limits of its unraveling 2015 nuclear deal with world powers after a U.S. airstrike killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad, abandoning the accord’s key provisions that block Tehran from having enough material to build an atomic weapon.

Iran insisted in a state television broadcast it remained open to negotiations with European partners, who so far have been unable to offer Tehran a way to sell its crude oil abroad despite U.S. sanctions. It also didn’t back off of earlier promises that it wouldn’t seek a nuclear weapon.

The announcement came Sunday night after another Iranian official said it would consider taking even-harsher steps over the U.S. killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Friday. Hundreds of thousands of people flooded the streets Sunday in Iran to walk alongside a casket carrying the remains of Mr. Soleimani, the former leader of its expeditionary Quds Force that organizes Tehran’s proxy forces in the wider Mideast.

The leader of one such proxy, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, said Mr. Soleimani’s killing made U.S. military bases, warships and service members spread across the region fair targets for attacks. A former Revolutionary Guard leader suggested the Israeli city of Haifa and “centers” like Tel Aviv could be targeted.

Iran’s state TV cited a statement by President Hassan Rouhani’s administration saying the country will not observe limitations on its enrichment, the amount of stockpiled enriched uranium as well as research and development in its nuclear activities.

“The government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has in a statement announced its fifth and final step in reducing Iran’s commitments under the JCPOA,” a state TV broadcaster said, using an acronym for the deal. “The Islamic Republic of Iran no longer faces any limitations in operations.”

It did not elaborate on what levels it would immediately reach in its program.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations watchdog observing Iran’s program, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Iran said that its cooperation with the IAEA “will continue as before.”

Meanwhile, Iraq’s parliament voted in favor of a resolution calling for an end of the foreign military presence in their nation, an effort aimed at expelling the 5,000 U.S. troops stationed there over the war against the Islamic State group.

Mr. Soleimani’s killing has escalated the crisis between Tehran and Washington after months of trading attacks and threats that have put the wider Middle East on edge. The conflict is rooted in Donald Trump pulling out of Iran’s atomic accord and imposing sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy.

Iran has promised “harsh revenge” for the U.S. attack, which shocked Iranians across all political lines. Many saw Soleimani as a pillar of the Islamic Republic at a moment when it is beset by U.S. sanctions and recent anti-government protests.

Retaliation for Soleimani could potentially come through the proxy forces which he oversaw. Soleimani’s longtime deputy Esmail Ghaani already has taken over as the Quds Force’s commander.

The U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia separately warned Americans “of the heightened risk of missile and drone attacks.”

Late Saturday, a series of rockets launched in Baghdad fell inside or near the Green Zone, which houses government offices and foreign embassies, including the U.S. Embassy.

Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter afterward that the U.S. had already “targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture.”

Mr. Trump did not identify the targets but added that they would be “HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.”

The 1954 Hague Convention, of which the U.S. is a party, bars any military from “direct hostilities against cultural property.” However, such sites can be targeted if they have been re-purposed and turned into a legitimate “military objective,” according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.

Iran, home to 24 UNESCO World Heritage sites, has in the past reportedly guarded the sprawling tomb complex of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, with surface-to-air missiles.

After thousands in Baghdad on Saturday mourned Soleimani and others killed in the strike, authorities flew the general’s body to the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz. An honor guard stood by early Sunday as mourners carried the flag-draped coffins of Soleimani and other Guard members off the tarmac.

The caskets then moved slowly through streets choked with mourners wearing black, beating their chests and carrying posters with Soleimani’s portrait. Demonstrators also carried red Shiite flags, which traditionally both symbolize the spilled blood of someone unjustly killed and call for their deaths to be avenged.

Officials brought Soleimani’s body to Ahvaz, a city that was a focus of fighting during the bloody, 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran in which the general slowly grew to prominence. After that war, Soleimani joined the Guard’s newly formed Quds, or Jersualem, Force, an expeditionary force that works with Iranian proxy forces in countries like Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

Authorities then took Soleimani’s body to the city of Mashhad later Sunday. State TV estimated that a million mourners came out to the Imam Reza shrine to pay their respects, although that number could not be independently verified. Soleimani’s remains will go to Tehran and Qom on Monday for public mourning processions, followed by his hometown of Kerman for burial Tuesday.

This marks the first time Iran honored a single man with a multi-city ceremony. Not even Khomeini received such a processional with his death in 1989. Soleimani on Monday will lie in state at Tehran’s famed Musalla mosque as the revolutionary leader did before him.

Mr. Soleimani was the architect of Iran’s regional policy of mobilizing militias across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, including in the war against the Islamic State group. He was also blamed for attacks on U.S. troops and American allies going back decades.

Although it’s unclear how or when Iran may respond, any retaliation was likely to come after three days of mourning declared in both Iran and Iraq.

Mohsen Rezaei, a former leader of the Guard, told a crowd of mourners in Tehran that the Israeli city of Haifa and other “centers” like Tel Aviv could be targeted. Mr. Rezaei earlier alleged without offering evidence that Israel leaked information to the U.S. about Mr. Soleimani’s whereabouts, which allowed them to carry out the drone strike.

""Rest assured we will level to the ground Haifa and Israeli centers so that Israel will be wiped out,” he said. “The issue is very serious for the Iranian nation. You hit us and you should get hit. You attacked us and it is the Iranian nation’s right.”

Iranian officials planned to meet Sunday night to discuss taking a fifth step away from its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, one that could be even greater than planned, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told journalists.

""In the world of politics, all developments are interconnected,” Mr. Mousavi said.

Iran previously has broken limits of its enrichment, its stockpiles and its centrifuges, as well as restarted enrichment at an underground facility.

The Iranian parliament on Sunday opened with lawmakers in unison chanting- “Death to America!” Parliament speaker Ali Larijani compared Mr. Soleimani’s killing to the 1953 CIA-backed coup that cemented the shah’s power and to the U.S. Navy’s shootdown of an Iranian passenger plane in 1988 that killed 290 people. He also described American officials as following “the law of the jungle.”

Rain fell at the shrine in Mashhad late Sunday as an imam delivered a sermon over the coffins of Mr. Soleimani and others stood. The crowd surged and shouted as he preached. Mourners threw clothing up to officials accompanying the remains to have the fabric be brushed against the caskets in a belief it would carry God’s blessings to them.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/sex74o/article30488777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Iranjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-abandons-nuclear-deal-limits-after-us-kills-general/article30488715.ece
36,2020/01/06,Pakistan will not allow its soil to be used for any regional conflict: FM Qureshi,"Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Sunday told his counterparts from several Muslim countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, that Islamabad will not allow its soil to be used for any regional conflict, amidst raging tensions between Tehran and Washington after the killing of top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in an American drone strike in Iraq.

Mr. Soleimani, 62, the head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force and architect of its regional security apparatus, was killed in a US drone strike in Baghdad on Friday, sparking fears of a new war in the Middle East.

The Pakistan Foreign Office said that Qureshi held telephonic conversations with his counterparts from Saudi Arabia, Iran, the UAE and Turkey to discuss the regional situation unfolding in the region.

“The Foreign Minister reaffirmed that Pakistan would neither let its soil be used against any other State nor become part of any regional conflict,” the Foreign Office (FO) said.

Highlighting Pakistan’s deep concern over the recent developments, Qureshi underscored the imperative of avoiding conflict, exercise of maximum restraint, and de-escalation of tensions.

He called on all parties concerned to abide by the UN Charter and principles of international law to settle differences through peaceful means.

Sharing Pakistan’s perspective, the foreign minister expressed hope that the progress made in the Afghan peace process would be preserved and advanced further.

He reiterated Pakistan’s readiness to continue to play a role in preventing further escalation and maintaining regional peace and stability, the FO said.

Hundreds of protesters, including women and children, rallied in Karachi and Islamabad to protest the killing of Soleimani.

The rallies organised by Shiite groups - including Imamia Students Organisation (ISO), Jaafria Alliance, Majlis-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM), Tanzeem Azadari and Shia Ulema Council - chanted anti-American slogans.

The protestor, carrying portraits of Soleimani and chanting slogans like “Down with USA!”, were stopped by police from moving toward the US consulate.

The protest rally in Islamabad started from the National Press Club and ended at the D-Chowk in front of Parliament. It was led by Shiite leader Allama Syed Ali Rizvi and women and children took part in the protest.

Pakistan has the biggest Shiite population after Iran and may face turbulence in case of a war between the U.S. and Iran.

The country, in the past, has tried to maintain a balance between Saudi Arabia and Iran which are regional rivals.

The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad already on Friday issued a countrywide security alert, warning its employees and US citizens to restrict their movement.

“Given possible reactions to recent events in Iraq, the U.S. Embassy has restricted travel by U.S. government employees. US government personnel in Pakistan are required to postpone non-essential official movements and most personal movements. US citizens in Pakistan should monitor their surroundings for possible demonstrations and suspicious activity,” the embassy said in a statement.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/h8lq3/article30488419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shah-Mahmood-Qureshijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-will-not-allow-its-soil-to-be-used-for-any-regional-conflict-fm-qureshi/article30488399.ece
37,2020/01/06,Sid Sriram took to public spaces across Chennai ahead of his ‘All Love No Hate’ tour,"To the unassuming background of honks and whirs of vehicles zooming past, the familiar chorus of ‘Adiye’ from Kadal, fills the air, instantly altering the mood.

Singer Sid Sriram is out on the streets, on a Sunday evening, as the crowd of shoppers in Pondy Bazaar slowly swells. People line up on either side of Sir Thyagaraya Road to catch a glimpse of the singer who took to the streets for an informal meet and greet with the public, peppering it with renditions of a few crowd favourites. A precursor to his upcoming concert All Love No Hate, scheduled to be held in February, this first attempt at a road show organised by Noise and Grains, is nothing more than a “teaser”, as Sid puts it — a taste of what one can expect.

Earlier in the day, Sid had also performed at Central Metro Station to the rather bewildered crowd making its way to the Central Railway station. Within minutes of his appearance, the exit way of the station was teeming with people. While some joined the crowd to find out what was going on, others had come prepared to meet the singer. Some even got to the venue after seeing Sid’s live feed on social media.

A hero’s entry

After multiple venue changes, the platform beside McDonald’s outlet at Pondy Bazaar is transformed into a makeshift performance space. Huddled in the same corner, are a bunch of shoppers and staff from McDonald’s listening intently to AR Rahman’s ‘Athankara Maname’, rendered by a young city-based band, Tune Station.

As Sid makes an appearance on the small elevation — an intimate stage setting on the pedestrian track — many phones go up in the air, almost immediately. The crowd makes it a point to document every bit of it, even if they miss seeing him live on stage.

He starts with ‘Adiye’, effortlessly pacing across the stage. And before long, the chorus is drowned by synchronised screams of excitement. Some have now clambered up a stack of brick-colour pipes, in an effort to put the show on the Gram. What follows is ‘Maruvarthai Paesathe’, which has people gently swaying and mouthing the lyrics as he sings. ‘Kannana Kanne’ and ‘Inkem Kavalae’ fittingly seals the deal.

“The main goal of this was to directly connect with people — to get up close and personal. This was for those people who don’t get an opportunity to come to my shows. At the end of the day, I am a performer doing a service to those who got me where I am today,” Sid says over a phone call after all the performances.

The demographic was different in each of the locations, he says. Much later in the day, at 7 pm, Sid along with Keba Jeremiah, Sanjeev Thomas and Tapass Naresh had also performed at Forum Vijaya Mall. “When you give audiences the opportunity to have a fun time, they go all out.” So, what can the audience expect for the upcoming All Love No Hate concert? Mainly his work in cinema along with songs from his recent album Entropy and more original music. “I have never really been comfortable with huge stage productions. I prefer a rock band style with a lot of raw energy and spontaneous interactions. It is always about the music and the joy in creating the music at that very moment. That will be the overall spirit and ethos of the show.”

All Love No Hate will be held on February 8, at YMCA Nandanam.

38,2020/01/06,Jamia protests through Read for Revolution,"A day after the Jawaharlal Nehru University debacle, Surekha Pillai, a student in her 20s, sits with a book in her lap, outside Gate No. 10 at Jamia Millia Islamia, reading. Behind her is a banner that says: ‘We learn together’, with the Preamble to the Constitution of India and photographs of Mahatma Gandhi forming a part of an ongoing photo exhibition.

She, and about 50-60 others who sit here every day, all with books in their hands, are a part of the Read for Revolution protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and all-India National. Register of Citizens. “The best way to improve yourself, to calm yourself, to become more tolerant is to pick up a book and read,” says Gayathri Sreedharan. She feels she’s doing her bit, as a subset of the larger protests: “Reading is possibly the most subtle political act,” she adds.

She’s still deeply disturbed by the December 15 incident at Jamia Millia Islamia. The violence in JNU has fuelled the anger — both institutions have involved students being injured, some grievously. With Jamia’s central library — the Zakir Husain Library — closed, Read for Revolution is the students’ way of protesting against the crackdown on education institutions.

Ironically, the library, named after Dr. Zakir Husain, former President of India and Jamia’s former Vice Chancellor, turned 100 this year. The library that’s usually open seven days a week, even during vacation time, has been shut after it was vandalised.

Sahil Ahmed and Tanya Sablok decided to set up a small makeshift library on December 24th, which they named Read for Revolution, right outside the university gate behind which the locked, empty reading room sits. They began with reading aloud on Satyagrah and Hindu-Muslim ekta from books like Hind Swaraj, Jamia Aur Gandhi, and The Constitution.

“We wanted to have a non-violent Gandhian way of protesting,” says Sahil, who is doing a master’s degree in Peace and Conflict. Jamia was one of the several educational institutions established in response to the call of non-cooperation by Gandhi.

People from the Gandhi Peace Foundation, writers like Rana Safvi, author of The Forgotten Cities of Delhi; teachers and scholars have donated books to the protest library.

While the crowd attending increases over the weekend, on January 3rd, the numbers swelled with many readers and writers (Archana Atree, Tanushree Singh, Rupa Gulab, Sayoni Basu) coming together with students to commemorate the birth anniversary of Savitribai Phule. She had fought for the rights of education, especially for women and the minorities in the 19th century.

Reading protesters like Gayathri feel it’s important to sit here and read, to make a point about being able to learn through books no matter what. Sahil and his fellow organisers invite participation from readers of all ages, to join them for regular reading sessions as well as for the exhibit on 100 years of the university itself.

39,2020/01/06,NGO Hand in Hand India familiarises tribal families with horti-agri forestry,"Did you know that most families in Tamil Nadu’s Jawadhu Hills are led by single women?

Reason: the men often migrate to other cities looking for work; the Jawadhu Hills are known for their sandalwood and red sanders and are rife with smugglers. This often leads to families losing their menfolk, leaving the task of fending for their families to the womenfolk.

This is where Hand in Hand India, an NGO that works towards rehabilitating children and destitute women, steps in. One of their programmes that deals with natural resources management, focuses on green livelihood development.

Through this, they have reached out to over 17,000 farmers across the country; the tribal people in Jawadhu Hills are one of their focus groups. Here, in association with NABARD and Supraja Foundation, the city-based NGO has been working on livelihood projects as part of which they encourage people to step into horti-agri forestry.

“We encourage them to plant trees such as mango, pomegranate and papaya, which leads to both afforestation and provides them an opportunity to earn a living from the produce. Deforestation is a major problem in the area,” says Sahaana Sankar, vice president, Hand in Hand India. “With most families losing their menfolk, their livelihoods are precarious. Through this programme, we encourage them to get back on their feet.”

Krishnan N, chief operating officer, Hand in Hand India, adds that this is a great way for families to earn an additional income. “We also have a farmers-producers organisation in the area and farmers can supply fruits to this organisation as well. Here the fruits are processed to produce fruit pulp,” he says, adding, “We want to target 200 such families through this programme.”

To this end, the organisation has now launched a Plant a Tree campaign on Give India to raise funds to help make livelihoods accessible to these families. “It might be called Plant a Tree, but the campaign goes beyond it,” says Sahaana, “We are training women-led households on sustainable livelihoods; of which, horti-agri forestry is a part. Family members can also work in the processing unit.”

The processing centre works with produce such as honey, fruits and millets (especially little millet or samai, that the area is known for).

Hand in Hand India works on educating these families on sustainable agricultural practices such as multi-cropping, organic farming, drip irrigation and launching farmer schools for introducing them to some of the latest agriculture practices for the past few years.

The Plant a Tree campaign, on the other hand, was launched a few weeks ago (and will run till mid-January) with the aim of giving the programme a boost. They have zeroed in on a group of women in the age group of 20 to 45 years, living in below-poverty-line conditions. The programme will provide them a long-term income-generating avenue through their own orchard of fruit-bearing trees.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/77cgdj/article30494444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03mpTree-Plantation,https://www.thehindu.com/society/ngo-creates-fruitful-ventures-for-tamil-nadus-tribals/article30494446.ece

We make new beginnings but with every failure, we wonder if we have it in us to start again. Here are two personalities from two different fields sharing their stories of failure and the courage with which they fought back.

Language of art

It is true that academic performance and examination results are not the only ways to determine a child’s creative skill and intelligence. A fine example is artist Manohar Chiluveru who had a severe learning disability and couldn’t identify the alphabet, read or write words till VII std! Though he was promoted every year, his teachers at Nehru Memorial High School in Warangal wondered if he would ever do anything in life. “I struggled to read even the word ‘if,’ maybe I was dyslexic. But those were rare and uncommon terms in those days,” he shares.

In an English medium school, he was not comfortable even in Telugu, his mother tongue. He recollects: “It was terrible; I became an introvert and would never talk for the fear of being ridiculed by my friends. I became frustrated, angry and isolated.” His school days were traumatic but it was during this frustrating phase that he learnt to motivate himself and survive.

His casual drawing to change mood became his emotional support. Turning point was in VII std when a teacher got mad as Manohar couldn’t read a paragraph. “He hit me and said: ‘Nuvvu emi chesi bratukutaavu’ and promised he will not punish me if I draw an object on his table. He was stunned seeing my sketch.”

With an encouraging sister-in-law, Manohar gained confidence and began to read and write. All the students who laughed at him raved his painting skills. “I realised I was not good in studies and If I have to prove myself, I need to excel in the field that god has given me.” In class X, he got a new idea and recorded the notes read by his friends. “I grasped the content and wrote it in the exams.” Post-intermediate, Manohar shifted to Telugu medium and took commerce in Kakatiya University. “I realised languages were bothering me. I couldn’t read, write or communicate well in languages so I came up with my own syllabus to go ahead in life.”

The one mantra that Manohar followed is to never compare his skills with others and not scared of attempting. “There are many mistakes when I speak English but I don’t care. I know I am not explaining literature. I am communicating my ideas in language of art; I speak that language well.”

I make a living out of talking’

On a stage devoid of props, the spotlight is on stand-up comedian Rohit Swain. Dressed in a casual tee and denims, the comic narrates his childhood story. “I took my cycle to the puncture shop and said: “Bhaiyya, meri cy... cy... cy... After hearing me stammer, the mechanic said Cycle ka hawa nikalgaya, aage batao.’” The audience breaks into peals of laughter.

Rohit is one of the few comedians who stammers and jokes on it in his comedy shows. It was no fun when he was studying in Allahabad (now Prayaagraaj). He says, “It is tough for every kid who stammers; They get bullied.” When Rohit was made fun of, he became silent. “My parents never accepted it and I never shared my school stories with them. So I didn’t know how to face it. To escape oral exams, I faked fever and cold and stayed at home.” In fact, he was the only student in his school who never said the pledge/morning prayer in his entire curriculum.

Charu Walia, one of his teachers told his mother about it. He recalls, “She said, “Your son doesn’t speak to anyone and he cannot live like this.’ Till then I had not imagined a job interview. I wondered if I was such a waste .”

For someone who hesitated to speak even with friends began participating in debates. “I had nothing to lose so decided to change. Instead of only thinking about people and their jokes on me I thought of topics for debates.” He became such an active participant in dance shows and skits that he did events even a day before his exam. “When my friends asked me the secret, I said, ‘I stammer but I attempt.”

Rohit moved to Hyderabad to join Tata Consulting Services and credits Toastmasters (the communication club) for his stand-up journey. “I learnt mannerisms while talking, how to articulate and voice modulation. “My closet friend Sugandh Rakha in Toastmasters has a high level of stammering but it is no hindrance. He is in a top position in his company leading a team of many people. Famous personalities (Mr Bean and Hrithik Roshan) stammer but have worked on their skills that stammering doesn’t have any effect.”

2019 was big as his two YouTube videos — Hyderabad and Biryani and Rich Richer Ambani have four million views. “Friends who felt I was incapable now google my name. I don’t need those who bring negativity in life. I cannot believe that someone who remained silent to avoid being mocked at makes a living now by just talking; This is my achievement.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/agc7bf/article30494009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym07rohit1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/manohar-chiluveru-and-rohit-swain-share-how-they-found-inspiration-to-start-afresh/article30494015.ece
41,2020/01/06,"At DakshinaChitra’s conservation lab, you can restore your old photographs","When L Amirthanathan is at the conservation lab with his team, nothing can distract him.

Working on a 100-year-old reproduction of Ravi Varma’s Goddess Saraswathi, he dips Japanese tissue paper (used by paper conservators) in methyl cellulose and retouches the image carefully. This process removes wrinkles. The image is further given back support with a melinex sheet.

“Everyone, every household has objects that need to be restored from damage, and usually it is an old photograph, a silk sari or antique furniture,” says Amirthanathan, who is the in-house conservator at DakshinaChitra heritage museum. And he believes that awareness is essential to safeguard objects from the past.

Owner’s pride Based on the products, materials and chemicals to be used for restoration, and the time it may take, an estimate is given to the customers. Once the customer agrees, the work is taken up.

Since it started extending the service to the public, the lab has so far restored an ivory jewel box which was broken into six pieces, a bronze vethalapetti (betel leaves box), about 15 terracotta golu dolls, one oil painting and a couple of termite-attacked, completely-destroyed black-and-white photographs.

According to Sharath Nambiar, director, DakshinaChitra, the country needs more conservators, as well as more institutions that provide professional training in conservation.

“In our country, we failed to pay attention to conservation, even though we have a fairly good number of museums,” says Sharath. At DakshinaChitra, the Madras Craft Foundation conducted a two-year-long conservation programme for four trainees and one of the staff members of the museum, with funding from the Tata Trust.

“Tody Cezar from Portugal, Petra Czerwinske from Germany, Anupam Sah, Deepshikha Kalsi, V Jeyaraj and S Girikumar from various museums in India had conducted training for these five students,” Sharath says. Apart from this, students were also sent to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Museum in Mumbai and others across the country for training.

At the lab, documentation is important. Any object that reaches them, is assessed by the conservator, and after careful study, a strategy is planned and details are documented.

The process

Conservators need to have a background in painting and history of art. It helps if they gain sufficient expertise in chemistry as well. Trained professionals clean, repair and restore a damaged artwork and preserve it. They could be dealing with anything from paintings to sculptures or even manuscripts.

“We mainly focus on restoring the artwork’s original look and make sure it looks less worn out,” Amirthanathan says. A keen eye for observation, a steady hand, extreme patience, combined with an interest in history and heritage, are prerequisites for those interested in building a career in this field. “Once we learn the basics of paper, textile, wood and art restoration using various scientific techniques, we can come up with innovative ideas and creative solutions on our own over a period of time based on our experience,” says Amirthanathan, adding that he restored an almost 150-year-old Bible, single-handedly.

Creative pursuit

When the leather-bound Bible reached the museum from a private collector, the outer leather cover with metal beading, replete with a brass lock, was completely damaged. There was red foxing on the vintage paper, and the pages had become brittle.

After assessment, Amirthanathan managed to restore the Bible to its original glory in a few weeks.

Similarly, he has restored a variety of diverse objects: a damaged terracotta drishti doll, numerous vintage photographs and paintings and a mosaic of Jesus’ crucifixion. They also work with antiques like papier-mache masks and glass lamps.

“If conservators combine their creativity with their knowledge and expertise, and if they enjoy the work they do, it can be the most satisfying career,” he says.

Today, there is better awareness among the public, says Amirthanathan. Old black-and-white photos are damaged mainly because they are hung directly on the wall. Termites, fungi and moisture in the wall damage the frame and cardboard.

DakshinaChitra has recently opened up their conservation and restoration services to the public as well.

42,2020/01/06,How prison warders in Tamil Nadu deal with daily stress,"Eyes closed, seated comfortably on the floor, nineteen warders at Central Prison II, Puzhal, pass around an ocean drum.

They carefully turn it to mimic the undulating sound of the ocean, as part of a movement workshop, which unites warders from prisons across Tamil Nadu every month.

“I designed this session to help them forget stress at work and home, and just concentrate on themselves, in the here and now. Music, sharing, stretching and core strengthening are focal points of the exercise,” explains Andrea Jacob, a movement therapist. She has worked with children with autism, and with the staff at The Banyan and Balm (mental health and social science research and teaching institution), developing a programme that combines sensory techniques, with meditation and core awareness.

Finding inner peace

The four female warders present, are shy at first, but open up as the afternoon unfolds.

The participants are taught to gently massage their arms, legs, stretch their facial muscles. Some do it with a chuckle, enjoying the moment of self-care.

“Three years back, movement therapy was introduced in our monthly training programmes for warders of Tamil Nadu prisons. We noticed that they had a set routine, leaving no time for themselves and their personal well-being. After the workshop, warders reported feeling more relaxed. More importantly, during circle session, each one of them got a chance to share,” states V Lalitha Raj, senior psychologist, The Banyan and Balm, who trains the counselling staff at the prison.

Warders learn to walk toe to heel, alternating between the two, to see a noticeable difference in their gait. “This is something we used to do as kids. We can definitely take this technique back to our neighbourhoods and teach others,” two participants share. A stretching routine in four parts, moving and breathing inward and outward, gets the warders enthused. Trust exercises follow, which also serve to strengthen the core, as participants find the right posture and bear the weight of their friends.

Learn to listen

The room is filled with staff in their late 20s and early 30s, with a few exceptions. “We like to recruit our warders young, so they can be moulded to align their work ethic with our process. They have to behave with a nuanced understanding of the people they oversee. We have close to 5,000 warders in Tamil Nadu, and we have seen them greatly benefit from programmes like movement, that promote wellness and mental health,” states Senthamaraikannan G B, superintendent of prisons, Puzhal.

Back at the workshop, the group moves to auditory exercises. A Tibetan sound bowl is the crowd favourite. Everyone is asked to listen to the tone till the very end, a metaphor for listening to each other, uninterrupted.

“Everything you do, can be therapeutic, in and of itself. Every experience is an outpouring and the warders unintentionally, let their guard down,” adds Dr C Anbudorai, psychiatrist, The Banyan.

Keep calm and relax

“We always worry about our jobs and families, distracting us from focusing on ourselves,” says Andrea, adding “Suppressed psychological stressors can be linked to multiple physical ailments, like a balloon waiting to burst.”

As she winds down the session, Andrea speaks in hushed tones, then stops altogether. She saves the best for last. Every warder lies face down, eyes shut, as lights are turned off and soft music plays. An exercise ball is rolled over them therapeutically, stimulating relaxation.

The music slowly fades out, the warders return to their spots. “ We come from different spaces, so each of us will take home something different from this experience,” says Ramganesh, a warder from Trichy Central Prison.

“Sharing. That is the biggest takeaway from this session. Everyone is encouraged to practise the simple routines, and if they take it forward, then the circle is complete,” concludes Andrea, before chatting with a few participants, as they leave, smiling from ear to ear.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/wc2rke/article30493253.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03mppuzhal3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/a-trust-fall-away-from-wellness/article30493254.ece

44,2020/01/06,"Resolve your differences: SC to Tatas, Wadia","The Supreme Court on Monday asked Tata Sons’ chairman emeritus Ratan N. Tata and industrialist Nusli Wadia to amicably settle their differences like “mature leaders of industry.”

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde was hearing an appeal filed by Mr. Wadia against a July 2019 Bombay High Court decision, quashing criminal defamation proceedings initiated by a local court, based on his complaint, against Mr. Tata, current Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran and eight directors.

In his petition, Mr. Wadia had alleged Mr. Tata and the others had made defamatory statements against him shortly after the removal of Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons’ chairman on October 24, 2016. Mr. Wadia was removed as an independent director from the boards of Tata Group companies between December 2016 and February 2017.

Monday’s hearing saw the courtSupreme Court attempting to broker peace between Mr. Wadia and Mr. Tata. The court, initially, even recorded an order that it “approved” the Bombay High Court finding that Mr. Tata never had an intention to defame Mr. Wadia.

However, shortly after the dictation of the order, senior advocate C.A. Sundaram, appearing for Mr. Wadia, informed the court that there was suit pending on the issue. Mr. Sundaram sought an adjournment to get further instructions from Mr. Wadia after the court made it clear that it wanted both sides to amicably settle the issue as soon as possible rather than let the case drag on in court. The court granted an adjournment till January 13.

During the hearing, the Chief Justice asked Mr. Sundaram how his client had concluded that he was defamed. “The statements may be right or wrong… but how do they become defamation?” Justice Bobde asked.

Mr. Sundaram said the statements included attacks on Mr. Wadia’s “bona fide” as an independent director. The senior advocate argued that his client was not against the company but “certain persons who made the statements and released it to the media”. Mr. Sundaram said his side had even sent a letter asking that the statements be withdrawn.

“Do you want to settle this? If you want, we can ask for a mediator and both of you can talk,” the Chief Justice offered both sides.

At this point, senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, for Mr. Tata, responded that “it was not our intention to defame him [Mr.Wadia]”. He drew the attention of the bench to the high court’s finding that “there was no intention to defame”.

Latching on to this, the bench said they agreed with the high court and suggested that the parties should indeed put an end to the dispute.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/resolve-your-differences-sc-to-tatas-wadia/article30496948.ece

51,2020/01/06,Godrej expects demand recovery this quarter,"Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., which was impacted by the slowdown in the market in the third quarter ended December 2019, is looking for gradual improvement in demand in the current quarter due to good monsoon and government stimuli, the company said.

It said during the quarter, it witnessed relatively mixed demand across some of its geographies of operations.

“In India, despite weak demand conditions, we continued our marginally higher than mid single-digit volume growth trend during the quarter. The uplift in volume growth was led by gradual recovery in household insecticides, new product launches, effective marketing campaigns and tactical consumer offers,” the company said in a filing with the stock exchanges, weeks ahead of the announcement of its Q3 results.

It said the sales value growth also mirrored the trend of past few quarters’ sales value growth. “In Indonesia, we recorded close to high single-digit constant currency sales growths, amid an improving demand environment in home and personal care space. The growths are driven by new product launches and gradual expansion of general trade distribution,” it said.

Trend reversal

“In GAUM (Godrej Africa, USA, Middle East), we saw good recovery with higher than mid single-digit constant currency sales growth, thus reversing the trend of the past few quarters. The performance was driven by improved performance in South Africa and Rest of Africa and Middle East cluster.”

52,2020/01/06,"After Reliance’s JioMart move, Amazon builds retail arsenal with Future Group deal","E-commerce giant Amazon signed a deal with Kishore Biyani’s Future Group, giving the online retailer a head start in the race to capture retail market in India. The announcement comes just days after Mukesh Ambani revealed his plans to sell food and groceries through Reliance’s JioMart.

The deal will combine the Future Group’s offline and Amazon’s online presence to deliver food, groceries, general merchandise, personal care products, and fashion and footwear within two hours in Dehli, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

""This arrangement will allow us to build upon each other's strengths in the physical and digital space so that customers benefit from the best services, products, assortment and price,"" Kishore Biyani, Chairman and Managing Director, Future Retail Ltd. said in a statement.

Future Group’s Big Bazaar and Foodhall will soon be listed on Amazon India’s marketplace, and the partnership has already launched online sales from 22 stores of Future retail.

""We are excited about the business collaboration with Future Retail Ltd (FRL). FRL's national footprint of stores offering thousands of products across fashion, appliances, home, kitchen and grocery will now be available to millions of customers shopping on Amazon.in, in hours across 25+ cities,"" Amit Agarwal, SVP & Country Head, Amazon India said in a statement.

Tying-up with Future Group could give a heft to Amazon’s online retail plans in India as FRL’s customer base of about 350 million footfalls across its retail network may soon be on the e-commerce giant’s growing list of online shoppers.

Online retail

According to a 2019 Jefferies report on online retail, individual shoppers will double their online spending to Rs. 25,138, from Rs. 12,800, by 2030. It also noted that shopping online will grow annually at 23% to $170 billion in ten years. During this period, online retail as a percentage of total organised retail market in India will jump to 37% from 25% in 2019.

This market and the unorganised retail market are driving Mr. Ambani’s retail ambitions. JioMart is currently available to customers in some part of Mumbai.

In August, Mr. Ambani told shareholders that his tech-enabled partnership will link producers, traders, small merchants, consumer brands and consumers. And now, he is bringing JioMart to showcase his experience with new commerce.

While Reliance’s JioMart executes its plan to transform 90% of the unorganised retail market, Amazon will deploy its experience from running Whole Foods for over two years now. During this time, Amazon has broadened shopping options and selectively discounted prices, and has effectively handled delivery of perishable products.

The partnership with Future Group will give an additional lift with Big Bazaar, EasyDay and Heritage Fresh.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/m06d62/article30493605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06AMAZONBENGALURU,https://www.thehindu.com/business/after-reliances-jiomart-move-amazon-builds-retail-arsenal-with-future-group-deal/article30493606.ece

55,2020/01/06,Amazon India inks long-term deals with Future Group,"Amazon India on Monday said it has entered into long-term business agreements with Future Group to extend the reach of the latter’s retail stores and consumer brands through its online marketplace.

The development comes after Amazon had agreed to buy 49% stake in Future Coupons Ltd that in turn holds stake in Future Retail Ltd (FRL) last year.

“FRL and Amazon India signed two agreements focusing on key categories - grocery and general merchandise, and fashion and footwear,” according to a statement released Monday.

Amazon India will also become the authorised online sales channel for FRL stores, and FRL will ensure participation of its relevant stores and programmes on the Amazon India marketplace, it added.

Future Consumer Ltd (FCL) has also inked a long-term agreement with Amazon Retail India Pvt Ltd (ARIPL) for distribution of Future Consumer’s portfolio of brands online. Some of FCL brands include Tasty Treat, Voom, Dreamery, Karmiq, Mother Earth, Kara, CleanMate and others.

As part of the partnership, FRL will augment existing store-infrastructure at its retail outlets for facilitating seamless packaging and pickup of products ordered online. FRL and Amazon India have already launched this service across 22 stores. Both companies plan on rolling this out across the entire FRL store chain based on agreed timelines.

“FRL will leverage its existing infrastructure, strong product knowledge and extensive brand portfolio resulting in higher store productivity and improved margins,” as per the statement.

Currently, FRL attracts over 350 million footfalls across its retail network, and Amazon India’s marketplace will enable FRL to reach a wider customer base.

Also, FRL will list on the Amazon Prime Now programme, allowing customers to get food, grocery and general merchandise delivery within two hours in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad.

FRL plans to soon list stores like Big Bazaar, and Foodhall in more cites on the Amazon India marketplace.

“In order to drive efficiencies, the two organisations will work closely through a dedicated team, and will explore synergies in distribution, customer acquisition, and marketing initiatives. This creates an enviable collaboration bringing together the best of consumer insights and geographical reach from the online and offline world,” the statement said.

Kishore Biyani, Chairman and Managing Director of FRL, said “this arrangement will allow us to build upon each other’s strengths in the physical and digital space so that customers benefit from the best services, products, assortment and price.”

“FRL’s national footprint of stores offering thousands of products across fashion, appliances, home, kitchen and grocery will now be available to millions of customers shopping on Amazon.in, in hours across over 25 cities,” Amazon India Senior Vice President and Country Head Amit Agarwal said.

56,2020/01/06,18 long weekends this year may give a boost to vacations,"With 2020 offering 18 long weekends, the highest in the last five years, Indians have started planning vacations, with families, couples, and millennials from Tier II and III cities taking the lead.

In 2019, there were 11 long weekends, the least in the last five years. Travellers living with locals and picking up skills from them during their stay are major trends. Aurangabad in Maharashtra, the Bannerghatta Biological Park in Karnataka, Chittorgarh in Rajasthan, Dholavira and Lothal in Gujarat, Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu, and Hampi in Karnataka are among the researched destinations.

“These are destinations known for educational tours,” Reji Philip, a south-Mumbai travel operator, said of the trend that is being increasingly discovered by many travellers.

Aloke Bajpai, co-founder and CEO, ixigo, said an increase in the capacity for the winter schedule had resulted in a 20% decline in domestic airfares.

“This has encouraged families, couples and millennials, especially from Tier II and III cities, to prefer short domestic getaways to international vacations this year. We have witnessed a 15-20% jump in bookings for domestic destinations this year for the just concluded December travel,” he said.

Significant rise

Ixigo said data showed a 15-20% jump in year-on-year advance bookings for such domestic destinations as Goa, Udhagamandalam, Puducherry, Bengaluru, Jaipur, Mysore and Agra.

On the international front, there was a 10-12% jump in bookings for such destinations as Singapore, Colombo, Bangkok, Dubai, Mauritius and Malaysia.

Costa Cruises, an Italian cruising company, part of the Carnival Corporation & plc, is offering Indians a chance to visit some 250 separate destinations with over 130 different itineraries and 60 embarkation ports. The company said it was eyeing the growing number of Indians looking for affordable cruise holidays, and are docking at major ports such as Mumbai, Goa and Kochi with new, India specific itineraries.

Nalini Gupta, managing director, Lotus Aero Enterprises, representative of Costa Cruises in India, said, “India is one of the only markets with a varied groups of customers, from corporate and wedding groups to honeymooners and senior citizens. With a perfect mix of relaxation and adventure, a cruise holiday provides a perfect getaway.”

Ms. Gupta said an analysis showed that travellers are realising the benefits of cruising, and cruise holidays are on the to-do list of many holidaygoers: they either add the cruise to their land holiday or many just take a fly-plus-cruise vacation. “The long weekends in the upcoming year will help them plan their holidays in advance,” she said.

Looking at passenger demand, IndiGo on Monday announced that Agra would be the 63rd domestic destination when it connects the city of the Taj Mahal to Bengaluru. William Boulter, chief commercial officer, IndiGo, said, “These flights will enable us to offer point-to-point connectivity from a city which houses one of the wonders of the world, witnesses an exceptional tourist footfall, and hence a high demand for connectivity. Operating exclusively on the Agra-Bengaluru route under the government’s UDAN scheme, IndiGo flights will promote trade and tourism in the region through increased mobility.”

An Indigo spokesperson said these flights were designed to cater for business and leisure travellers who are on the lookout for new and affordable flying options.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vwdz9b/article30496794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THAIRLINEPASSENGERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/18-long-weekends-this-year-may-give-a-boost-to-vacations/article30496795.ece
57,2020/01/06,New data relay satellites to keep Gaganyaan crew in touch with Earth,"India plans to ring in its own era of space-to-space tracking and communication of its space assets this year by putting up a new satellite series called the Indian Data Relay Satellite System.

The IDRSS is planned to track and be constantly in touch with Indian satellites, in particular those in low-earth orbits which have limited coverage of earth.

In the coming years, it will be vital to Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), whose roadmap is dotted with advanced LEO missions such as space docking, space station, as well as distant expeditions to moon, Mars and Venus. It will also be useful in monitoring launches, according to K. Sivan, ISRO Chairman and Secretary, Department of Space.

The first beneficiary would be the prospective crew members of the Gaganyaan mission of 2022 who can be fully and continuously in touch with mission control throughout their travel.

“When we have the Gaganyaan mission we want it to be covered and be visible 100% so that action can be taken in any exigency,” he said.

Work initiated

Work on the two IDRSS satellites planned initially has begun. The first of them will be sent towards the end of 2020. It will precede the pre-Gaganyaan experimental unmanned space flight which will have a humanoid dummy. A second one will follow in 2021. The two will offer near total tracking, sending and receiving of information from the crew 24/7.

Older space majors such as the U.S. and Russia started their relay satellite systems in the late 1970s-80s and a few already have around 10 satellites each. They have used them to monitor their respective space stations Mir and the International Space Station, and trips that dock with them, as well as the Hubble Space Telescope.

Dr. Sivan said IDRSS satellites of the 2,000 kg class would be launched on the GSLV launcher to geostationary orbits around 36,000 km away. In such apparently fixed orbits, they would be covering the same area on earth. A satellite in GEO covers a third of the earth below and three of them can provide total coverage.

‘IDRSS is imperative’

During the launch of the human mission and also when the crew craft orbits earth from a distance of 400 km, at least one ground station must see and track it. But with available ground stations, that would not be the case. Without data relay satellites, ISRO would have to create a large number ground stations everywhere or hire them globally and yet the crewed spacecraft would not be visible all the time.

“We require the IDRSS system when our astronauts are in space. But I would prefer the relay spacecraft to be in place even before we launch the unmanned mission,” Dr. Sivan said.

While the U.S. is putting up its third-generation advanced fleet of TDRS (Tracking & Data Relay Satellites), Russia has its Satellite Data Relay Network and Europe is building its own European Data Relay System. China is into its second generation Tianlian II series.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/os6f59/article30496771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6IN-SIVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-satellites-will-help-gaganyaan-crew/article30496759.ece
58,2020/01/06,JNU violence: Masked miscreants used ‘code words’,"The Delhi police have said that the masked miscreants used “code words” during the violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Sunday to avoid beating up their own people.

A senior police officer said that after violence broke out in the Periyar hostel late in the afternoon, the hostellers circulated messages on WhatsApp asking for help from other residents and friends outside.

The police said they had got the screen shots of the messages posted by the goons inciting the mob. The police are going through the details of the suspect mobile phone numbers and trying to match their location with the time of the violence.

Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa said they had come across several screen shots of chats during the violence and mobile videos. “The Crime Branch has seized many of these screen shots and mobile videos to reconstruct the sequence of events,” Mr. Randhawa said.

JNUSU complaint

The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union alleged on Sunday that WhatsApp groups had been created to help the attackers single out union representatives.

Asked about these WhatsApp groups, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad said they had been created by leftist students trying to “malign our organisation.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hz625n/article30496660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7TH-STUDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-violence-masked-miscreants-used-code-words/article30496661.ece
59,2020/01/06,JNU violence: Left parties demand sacking of vice-chancellor Jagadesh Kumar,"The Left parties on Monday demanded the immediate sacking of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) vice-chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar, calling him “complicit” in the violence late on Sunday by allowing masked goons to have a free run in the campus and stalling the entry of Delhi police.

Left MPs plan to write to President Ramnath Kovind with a plea for him to use his role as Chancellor of JNU to dismiss Mr. Kumar. The first off the block was CPI(M) Rajya Sabha MP Elamaram Kareem who sent a letter to Mr. Kovind demanding Mr. Kumar’s dismissal.

Whatever happened in JNU on Sunday night is completely unacceptable and condemnable, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said. “The attack is not only an assault on higher education but an assault on reason, rationality and democracy, ” he said, adding that it is clear that the attack was pre-planned.

Quoting earlier instances of violence in Aligarh Muslim University and Hyderabad University, Mr Yechury said this is a systematic assault on higher education institutes.

It would be wrong to portray the Sunday night attack only as rivalry between two students groups, he said.

“For five hours nearly, the V-C did not respond and didn’t ask Delhi Police, who were standing just outside the university gates, to come and restore normalcy. This makes him also complicit in the entire attack. He must be sacked immediately,” Mr Yechury said.

He added that VC has failed to accept the formula decided upon by all sides on the contentious issue of fee hike in the university despite pressure from the Ministry of Human Resources and Development.

His colleague CPI General Secretary D Raja said the government often mocks JNU students as “tukde tukde” gang but the real members of such a gang were the government themselves. “It is actually ‘Tukde Tukde’ government; it they who are dividing people and country,” Mr. Raja added.

The veteran CPI leader termed Sunday night’s incident as a “cowardly fascist attack”.

“A university is the place for ideas, questioning, criticism and so on which the government doesn't want. This is clearly fascism to strangle independent voices,” he added.

60,2020/01/06,"State can regulate minority institutions, says Supreme Court","The Supreme Court on Monday held that the state is well within its rights to introduce a regulatory regime in the “national interest” to provide minority educational institutions with well-qualified teachers in order for them to “achieve excellence in education.”

The managements of minority institutions cannot ignore such a legal regime by saying that it is their fundamental right under Article 30 of the Constitution to establish and administer their educational institutions according to their choice.

In a 151-page judgment, a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U.U. Lalit said the regulatory law should however balance the dual objectives of ensuring standard of excellence as well as preserving the right of the minorities to establish and administer their educational institutions. Regulations that embrace and reconcile the two objectives were reasonable, it said.

Referring to the 11-judge Bench decision in the TMA Pai Foundation case, Justice Lalit, who authored the verdict, said Article 30(1) (right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice) was neither absolute nor above the law.

“When it comes to the right to appoint teachers, in terms of law laid down in the TMA Pai Foundation case, a regulation framed in the national interest must necessarily apply to all institutions regardless whether they are run by majority or minority as the essence of Article 30(1) is to ensure equal treatment between the majority and minority institutions. An objection can certainly be raised if an unfavourable treatment is meted out to an educational institution established and administered by minority. But if ensuring of excellence in educational institutions is the underlying principle behind a regulatory regime and the mechanism of selection of teachers is so designed to achieve excellence in institutions, the matter may stand on a completely different footing,” Justice Lalit wrote.

The court explains how to strike a “balance” between the two objectives of excellence in education and the preservation of the minorities’ right to run their educational institutions.

For this, the court broadly divides education into two categories – secular education and education “directly aimed at or dealing with preservation and protection of the heritage, culture, script and special characteristics of a religious or a linguistic minority.”

When it comes to the latter, the court advocated “maximum latitude” to be given to the management to appoint teachers. The court reasons that only “teachers who believe in the religious ideology or in the special characteristics of the concerned minority would alone be able to imbibe in the students admitted in such educational institutions, what the minorities would like to preserve, profess and propagate.”

However, minority institutions where the curriculum was “purely secular”, the intent must be to impart education availing the best possible teachers.

The judgment came on a challenge to the validity of the West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act of 2008. The State Act mandated that the process of appointment of teachers in aided madrasahs, recognised as minority institutions, would be done by a Commission, whose decision would be binding.

The apex court upheld the validity of the 2008 Act, saying the Commission was composed of persons with profound knowledge in Islamic Culture and Islamic Theology. The court said the provisions of the Act were “specially designed” for madrasahs and the madrasah education system in West Bengal. The court concluded that the Act was “not violative of the rights of the minority educational institutions on any count.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lvg2qb/article30496646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/state-can-regulate-minority-institutions-says-supreme-court/article30496632.ece
61,2020/01/06,"JNU violence: It’s state-sponsored goondaism, says Congress","The Congress on Monday accused the Union government of carrying out “state-sponsored goondaism and terrorism” at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Party president Sonia Gandhi said, “The bone-chilling attack...is a grim reminder of the government’s effort to stifle and subjugate dissent.”

Demanding an inquiry into the Sunday night violence by a sitting Supreme Court or High Court judge, the party said the probe should look into the role of the government, the university administration and the Delhi police.

Former Union Finance and Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Commissioner of the Delhi police should be held accountable.

The Congress also alleged that at least six former office-bearers of the BJP in Delhi were leading a mob outside the campus, who were inciting violence.

Ms. Gandhi, who called up Opposition leaders to rally them round, set up a four-member fact-finding team that would submit a report on the violence in a week. “The horrifying and unprecedented violence unleashed on India’s young by goons, with the active abetment of the Modi government, is deplorable and unacceptable. Every day, campuses and colleges are raided across India, either by the police or lumpen elements with the support of the BJP government,” she said in a statement.

“Yesterday’s bone-chilling attack on students and teachers at the JNU is a grim reminder of the extent the government will go to stifle and subjugate every voice of dissent. Students and youth need affordable education, a deserving job, a promising future and a right to participate in our thriving democracy. Sadly, the Modi government seeks to suffocate and restrain each one of these aspirations,” she said.

“I am absolutely sure that there was intelligence. Either they winked at it or connived with the perpetrators, which is why this terrible incident took place... So the buck starts with the Commissioner of Police and stops with the Home Minister,” Mr. Chidambaram said at a press conference. “This is no longer a creeping fascism, this is a rapid descent into fascism. All that we see is fascist action all around — at Jamia Milia, at JNU and in Uttar Pradesh,” he said.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the incident reminded one of the Nazi style violence. “The manner in which the youth is being attacked and their voices are stifled reminds us of the Nazi Germany of 1933, which seems to have come back under the rule of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah after 90 years,” he said.

“‘What enmity do you have with students and the youth of India, Modiji and Amit Shahji?’ That is the question that the Indian National Congress and the people of India ask. Why are you torturing, suffocating, subjugating the youth and students of India under your autocratic and despotic rule,” he asked.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/58wnf3/article29344275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-31-sonia,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/its-state-sponsored-goondaism-congress/article30496613.ece
62,2020/01/06,"CMs decry JNU violence, anger resonates in universities","Chief Ministers of non-BJP-ruled States and eminent personalities decried the attack on students and faculty of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) by masked goons on Sunday evening. Protest marches were held at several campuses across the country on Monday to express solidarity with JNU students.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray compared the JNU violence with the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack and said, “ Students are feeling unsafe in the country. I will not allow anything like JNU to happen in Maharashtra.” Maharashtra Minister Jitendra Awhad also joined an overnight protest by students at the Gateway of India.

Calling the attack a “fascist surgical strike”, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee urged students to “unite and fight together against the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre”. Harking back to her early days as a student leader, the Trinamool Congress chief cited the situation in JNU, Aligarh Muslim University and “even Visva-Bharati” to illustrate what she called a “dangerous planned attack on democracy”.

Ms. Banerjee's Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik also condemned the attack, tweeting that violence has no space in democracy and such attacks on students must be condemned unequivocally. The Biju Janata Dal leader appealed to the law enforcement agencies to take stiff action to apprehend the culprits.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh of the Congress called the violence “barbaric and atrocious” and said the situation in JNU is clearly out of hand. Tagging Delhi Police in a tweet, he said it cannot remain a silent spectator to the mayhem unleashed by a handful of goons in the premier university.

Condemning the violence, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the “Nazi-style onslaught” on students and teachers inside the campus was an attempt to create unrest and violence in the country. The CPI(M) leader said news reports about Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad activists attempting to stop the ambulance carrying the injured students' union president showed the extent of their plan to create a riot.

Nobel laureate and JNU alumnus Abhijit Banerjee also invoked the N-word, telling News18.com that the incident “has too many echoes of the years when Germany was moving towards Nazi rule”. The MIT professor called on the Modi government to establish the truth of what happened in JNU.

Top industrialists such as Anand Mahindra, Harsh Mariwala and Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, actors Alia Bhatt, Anil Kapoor, Rajkummar Rao and sportspersons including former India opener and BJP MP Gautam Gambhir were among those who condemned the attacks.

Anger over the JNU violence resonated in universities across the country. In the second protest within 24 hours, hundreds of students of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) took out a 'Tiranga Yatra' on Monday to condemn the attack on JNU students. On Sunday night, they had taken out a candlelight procession in solidarity with JNU after news of violence in the university spread.

At Punjab University, some students disrupted the address of Haryana Assembly Speaker Gian Chand Gupta at a seminar and shouted slogans against the RSS, ABVP and BJP; security personnel removed the protesters from the seminar hall.

Protests also took place at Pondicherry University, Bangalore University, National Law University in Bengaluru, University of Hyderabad, Osmania University, University of Mumbai, Delhi University, Ambedkar University Delhi, IIT-Bombay, TISS Mumbai, Banaras Hindu University, Chandigarh University, Savitri Bai Phule University in Pune, Jadavpur University and Presidency University, Kolkata.

Chidambaram on Monday warned that the Indian economy could face more turbulence if oil prices rose further amid mounting U.S.-Iran tensions and contended that the government was “clueless about the economy even as it is sinking”.

“I do not think, they have the wisdom to deal with a situation like in 1991; so, God forbid, that we go back to 1991,” he asserted, speaking to reporters on the possibility of a military flare-up in West Asia, and its likely impact on crude prices.

“While the fire lit by the hurried passage of CAA rages across the country, the economy continues to sink. There has not been a single silver lining in the last six months,” he said, observing that imports had declined by 8.37% and exports had shrunk by 2.21% compared to last year.

“The fiscal deficit will breach the budget limit of 3.4%. WPI is at 1.92% and CPI at 5.54%. Food inflation has crossed 10%. As warned, the cut in corporate tax rates did not boost investment. Private consumption declined significantly,” he said and added, “I have no expectations from this government’s economic policies”.

He said direct tax revenue collections were only 41.6% of the budget estimates and the credit growth to industry was 3.4% while manufacturing output had shrunk by 3.8%.

64,2020/01/06,Opposition to frame common strategy on citizenship Act,"The Opposition parties are likely to meet on January 13 to formulate a common position and strategy on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. The Congress is organising the meeting and has reached out to like-minded parties.

So far, a majority of protests against the amended Citizenship Act have been from the civil society with occasional participation from the political class. The meeting comes on the heels of the recent victory of the Opposition parties in the Maharashtra and the Jharkhand Assembly polls.

“The CAA, which will be followed by the NRC, will destroy the very fabric of our country, and we need to come together to counter such nefarious plans of the government,” a senior Opposition leader said.

Weak position

The Opposition parties also feel that the spontaneous protests across the country against the controversial legislation have left the government on a weak spot.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to make a tactical retreat when he said his government did not talk about the NRC since 2014 and it is not on the table. This despite his deputy and Home Minister Amit Shah repeatedly asserting that the NRC will follow the CAA,” another Opposition leader said.

Sources said a majority of the parties which had opposed the legislation in Parliament were on board.

The Opposition parties are toying with ideas such as forming a permanent coordination committee which would have two members from each of them.

The Congress being the largest Opposition party will have five members. Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, party’s Rajya Sabha leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary and Ahmed Patel are likely to be part of the coordination committee.

Economic issues

There will be other issues on the table, the foremost will be the state of the economy. The Opposition has unsuccessfully tried to focus the narrative on economy.

The parties, sources said, are mulling over bringing a White Paper ahead of the Union Budget highlighting the problems such as the revenue shortfall of ₹5 lakh crore in the government books, delayed GST payouts to States and “overall data fudging” by the government.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q16ai2/article30496549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07CAAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-to-frame-common-strategy-on-citizenship-act/article30496550.ece
65,2020/01/06,"JNU students, staff seek vice-chancellor Jagadesh Kumar’s ouster","The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU) and the Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers Association (JNUTA) on Monday demanded the immediate removal of JNU Vice-Chancellor M. Jagdeesh Kumar following the brutal attack by masked goons on the university campus on Sunday night.

Under fire for allowing the violence to continue, the Delhi police said an FIR had been registered against “unknown persons” for rioting and damage to property. No arrests have been made so far.

34 treated for injuries

Thirty-four persons injured in the attack, who were brought to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Sunday night, were discharged after treatment. One teacher was taken to Safdarjung Hospital and later discharged, an official said.

“Several students had broken limbs and head injuries. They were discharged after first aid,” said a senior official at the AIIMS.

“I was specifically targeted on Sunday during a peace march on the campus. Around 20-25 masked persons disrupted the march and attacked me with iron rods,” said JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh at a press conference, her arm in a cast and bandages on her head — she required at least 15 stitches following the attack.

The BJP’s student wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), denied it was behind Sunday’s attacks, as alleged by both the JNUSU and the JNUTA.

The outfit, in turn, blamed Ms. Ghosh’s left-wing union for orchestrating the violence. It also claimed that many of its activists were injured, but did not present any to the media.

The JNUSU and a number of faculty members have accused the Delhi police of being bystanders to the violence and allowing the attackers to leave the premises after going on the rampage for several hours.

‘A shameful episode’

“The violence that happened on Sunday is the result of the desperation and frustration of the V-C and his cronies. But the chronology of events that unfolded is a shameful episode for the Delhi police who gave a safe passage to ABVP goons imported from outside. For days now, the administration has been unable to break our protest. Since 4th January, ABVP people were directed as henchmen of the V-C to come and beat up students. They used lathis and pipes on that day,” JNUSU alleged in a statement.

In a separate development, the JNUTA has written an open letter to President Ram Nath Kovind on the connivance between the attackers and the JNU administration.

“The JNUTA with full sense of responsibility accuses the JNU Administration headed by the Vice-Chancellor of being responsible for the orgy of violence in JNU…It is evident that without the connivance of the Administration, the entry into the campus of several of the goons who were not from the campus, and their subsequent exit without being caught, would not have been possible.”

“There are also reports from different eyewitnesses that members of the JNU Administration helped some such people in gaining entry and then provided shelter to them in their residences on campus. The absence of any action for several hours by the Security or the Police to stop the violence, despite being informed of it, also reveals the complicity of the Administration in the violence…,” JNUTA added.

Professor Jayati Ghosh, who teaches at JNU, said in a tweet: “This was a planned, state-sponsored attack on #JNU when all other attempts to break the struggle of the students had failed, and when a compromise solution was clearly in sight. The Modi-Shah government wants JNU destroyed.”

The V-C, however, showed no signs of relenting from his stand and claimed in a statement that “the origin of the present situation” lies in some agitating students “turning violent” and obstructing academic activities of other students.

66,2020/01/06,JNU violence: Govt has given free hand to supporters to attack dissenters: ex-IAS officer,"Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan on Monday said the BJP government at the Centre had a tendency to write off dissenting voices by calling them names and branding them enemies of the country, and had given a free hand to its supporters to attack them.

Speaking at a protest by students and activists in Bhopal against the violence at the Jawaharlal Nehru University on Sunday, he said, “When it’s students, they call them tukde-tukde gang; educated middle class, urban naxals; Muslims, terrorists; Sikhs, Khalistanis; and Hindus, anti-national. The government has a name for everyone asking questions. It has given a free hand to supporters to attack them.”

Even during the Emergency of 1970s attacks like this had not occurred on campuses, Mr. Gopinathan, who resigned from service over the removal of special status to Jammu and Kashmir, said. “We should be scared. But they should be scared a thousand times over since their one move has brought thousands of students on the streets.”

People took activism on the social media as democracy, he said, but now they were trying to understand issues, and if needed, hit the streets. “This is democracy...This is a country of social movements. And I don’t think the government follows Mahatma Gandhi, it’s actually these protesting students.”

Pallavi Mishra, a law student in New Delhi, said: “The larger purpose of the protest is to dissent against the systemic oppression by the BJP against those asking questions and the fourth pillar of democracy. This government has a tendency to react violently. It’s the larger picture that everyone needs to reckon with.” Calling out “apolitical” people, she said, “They are idiots, because they can’t fathom the amount of distress our democracy and the Constitution is under at this point.”

Educationist Anil Sadgopal said the men wore masks not just to evade action, but because they were ashamed of their own actions. “They can’t face the youth today, who’ve been leading protests for weeks now.” Quoting from freedom fighter Bhagat Singh’s ‘Student and Politics’, he said, “Students understand that they need to study. But what use is education when it doesn’t explain prevailing issues, spells ways to deal with them and defines the youth’s duty.”

Saumya Singh, a graduate, termed the JNU incident “heart-wrenching. “The gundaraj of the BJP has come out in the open. It is trying to create chaos across the country to win forthcoming elections.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pu9l5h/article30495847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-KANNANGOPINATHAN-AMFARUQUI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-has-given-free-hand-to-supporters-to-attack-dissenters-ex-ias-officer/article30495850.ece
67,2020/01/06,"Harsimrat Kaur Badal has no clue about the implications of CAA, says Punjab CM Amarinder Singh","Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday hit out at Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, accusing her of attempting to use the killing of a Sikh youth and the attack on Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan to carry out her political battle against the Congress.

Referring to Ms. Harsimrat’s tweets in which she had sought to promote the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the context of the persecution of minorities in Pakistan and attacked Capt. Amarinder and the Indian National Congress leadership, Capt. Amaridner said, “This is the height of ignorance and stupidity.

“The CAA, coupled with National Register for Citizens (NCR), is the kind of tool with which minorities in India will be persecuted even more than those in Pakistan are,” he said, adding that it was apparent that the Union Minister had no clue about the implications of the CAA or the damage it would cause to India’s secular character, particularly in conjunction with the NRC.

Capt. Amarinder said the brazen attacks on minorities including Sikhs in Pakistan were appalling and indefensible. As if these attacks were not shocking enough, Ms. Harsimrat and the rest of the Akali leadership had stooped to a shocking low by using them to defend the CAA and target the Congress party, he said in a statement.

The Chief Minister also accused SAD of “double-speak” on the CAA and the NRC, pointing out that just days back, Akali chief Sukhbir Singh Badal had asked for minorities to be included in the purview of the CAA. “Don’t they have any clear stand?” These conflicting statements exposed the double standards of the Akalis on this grave issue, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2fcva3/article30495742.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-AMARINDERSINGH-AKHILESHKUMAR-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/harsimrat-kaur-badal-has-no-clue-about-the-implications-of-caa-says-punjab-cm-amarinder-singh/article30495670.ece
68,2020/01/06,"Bond with Jamia stronger now, can’t wait to return, say students","On a frigid December night, Sarah Khan shot up in her bed, frantically coughing, flailing about in the smoke filling her room from a tear gas shell lobbed in by the police. She knew she had to escape the reading room at the Jamia Millia Islamia, where she was preparing for the next day’s exam. Waking up with a start from the nightmare, she tossed and turned for the next couple of hours before slipping back to sleep in the safety of her house in Bhopal.

Panic attacks, sleeplessness and lack of appetite became the norm for Ms. Khan, 21, a postgraduate student in applied psychology, for days after the campus siege by the Delhi police on December 15, which left in its wake not just shattered windows, battered doors and overturned benches, but also broken students.

“We were like soldiers there. It was like a ritual, reach the protest site at 10 a.m., return by 10 p.m.,” recalls Ms. Khan, who along with hundreds of students stridently opposed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens, on the campus in New Delhi, and back home.

The subsequent unprecedented turn of events took Ms. Khan, now referred to as a krantikari (revolutionary) at home, by surprise: the police lathi-charged students, male personnel did not spare even female students, and worst of all, the campus turned unsafe. Still, Ms. Khan, whose brother lives in Bhopal, and parents in Saudi Arabia, proudly calls Jamia her second home.

For a week at least, she underwent medication for anxiety, and skipped the vacation ritual of meeting relatives. Instead, Ms. Khan remained mostly glued to her phone, keeping track of the nationwide protests on a WhatsApp group. Only daal-chawal (rice with lentils), the first meal after her escape from the violence at the Jamia campus, seemed acceptable, even back home.

Left with two semester exams, the university abruptly declared a vacation following the violent siege, and realising she had to be unhurt for her family’s sake, she returned to the “sleepy” city of Bhopal on December 17. Now, her next exam has been postponed to January 21.

“I can’t wait to go back,” she quips. “I feel like I have abandoned the fight for a cause. I wish I was there at the Shaheen Bagh sit-in, led by women on New Year’s eve.” In Bhopal, as part of an incipient collective of artists and students, Parinde, taking part in protests has become routine for her.

Preparation for her exams have taken a back seat, she says. “I have been following the news, and read the CAA and the rules regarding the National Population Register, and am spreading awareness in the family.”

Her affinity for Jamia, she claims, has intensified after the protests. “As per the ‘us versus them’ principle in psychology, even if you’re divided, when an external force tries to shut you down, you become one. That is how we became one unit,” she explains.

On December 12, when the police lobbed tear-gas shells inside the campus, it was the first inkling that they could come inside too. A handy box of salt was the only protection each student carried. “Rubbing salt on the face, or taking a pinch on the tongue can reduce the effect of tear gas,” says Ms. Khan, who’d borne a sore, freckled face during the protests, being at the forefront most of the time and having faced two shells.

Students set up water points, salt centres and food spots to replenish themselves, before returning to the protest site. “It was like a movie. If it all hadn’t turned violent, we would have flaunted the entire episode as cool. But the way things unravelled, it ceased to be a good memory,” she says, adding that her Kashmiri friends joked morbidly that New Delhi was finally experiencing the Valley’s reality.

Only when campus security guards came running towards students asking for help did they realise the police had breached the gates. And Ms. Khan, who first ran towards the reading room along with a few friends, was whisked away by a stranger to her friend’s apartment. “He was an angel in disguise. There were boys guiding us on the way, on the phone, the whole time, telling us to take right, then left through a maze-like route. We had to be quiet, and were running on our toes, lest the police should hear us. We couldn’t even breathe,” she recalls.

On reaching the apartment at Noor Nagar, they first shut all doors and windows, and prepared some daal-chawal. But the realisation that their fellow students were still bearing the brunt of the police action on campus, quickly dissipated their appetite and they left their plates untouched until about 3 a.m. “It was the longest night of my life. It seemed like a funeral.”

A Development Communication postgraduate student, Paoni Patidar says she is a proud student of Jamia as it showed the country the way. “I want to be a part of protests once I go back,” she adds.

Cautioning her against getting too involved in agitations, her parents have asked her to return to college, which reopened on Monday, at least a week later, so that she could gauge the situation first from friends.

“For at least a week I was mentally disturbed, angry at the situation. And my mother accompanied me to the Iqbal Maidan protest. She could see how much it affected me,” says Ms. Patidar.

The campus won’t be the same again, she adds, “Because my library is broken and there has been bloodshed.”

Sensing the situation spiralling into violence, her parents asked her to return on December 15 morning. “While I was in the train, a friend hiding inside the reading room called me saying ‘the gates were shut, the lights off’. She asked me to open the gates. And some engineering students couldn’t take their exam because of the tear gas,” she recalls.

Journalism students were sending the media videos and writing stories. “On the first day of the protest, I had even video-called parents from the site. But we didn’t know it would turn this bad,” Ms. Patidar says, her voice trailing away.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kx6sa0/article30495610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07JAMIAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bond-with-jamia-stronger-now-cant-wait-to-return-say-students/article30495611.ece
69,2020/01/06,Ahmedabad Police attempt to disrupt IIM-A event,"A team of Ahmedabad Police on Sunday apparently tried to disrupt an event organised by some students, faculty and staff members of the prestigious Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad (IIM-A) by forcing the organisers to shift the event to a classroom. However, the organisers defied the restriction and held the event on the campus, slamming the police for trying to suppress dissent using force.

According to sources in the Institute, a local team from the City Police came to the campus around 5.30 p.m., before the event, ‘IIM-A stands up for democracy’, which was scheduled to be held at 6.30 p.m. at the Louis Kahn Plaza of the IIM-A, could begin.

‘Police pressure’

The security officer of the campus, citing police pressure, interfered with the programme and tried to cancel it. But faculty members stepped in. After some discussions, the event was shifted into a classroom.

The installations and posters were also shifted to the new venue.

According to Anmol Somanchi of IIM, students, faculty and staff came together to condemn police brutality, arbitrary Internet blackouts, and the restrictions on peaceful assembly being enforced across the country.

After the incident, the organisers issued a press statement: “We write this to register our protest against repeated and pervasive attempts at suppression of the right to free and democratic dissent.”

“In particular, we strongly condemn the violence unleashed by police on unarmed students, including minors, at Cotton University, Jamia Milia Islamia University, Aligarh Muslim University and other educational institutions. We also note with concern the unlawful and arbitrary detentions of members of IIM-A fraternity and others across the country.”

‘Reform policing’

Mr. Somanchi added that the solidarity gathering commenced in the classroom, where a collective statement was read out, condemning the conduct of the police, and the need for urgent reform in policing.

Subsequently, group of students, faculty and staff members decided to defy the restrictions on assembling outside the classroom, and moved to the corridor, where they read the Preamble of the Constitution with candles in their hands.

In the gathering, faculty members shared their experiences of being part of student movements, and about taking a stand on political issues that concern society.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4xgefv/article30495724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-IIM-A-SPECIALARRANGEMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ahmedabad-police-attempt-to-disrupt-iim-a-event/article30495578.ece
70,2020/01/06,Don’t send children excluded from Assam NRC to detention camps: Supreme Court,"The Supreme Court on Monday ordered that children excluded from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) for Assam but whose parents/guardians/caregivers are part of the final list, should not be sent to detention camps or separated from their loved ones at any cost.

Appearing before a Bench led by Chef Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, Attorney General K.K. Venugopal was required to record an undertaking before the court in a petition filed by NGO Citizens for Justice and Peace. Over 19 lakh people in the State have been excluded from the final NRC list that was published on August 31 last. Its preparation was monitored by the Supreme Court.

Senior lawyer Aparna Bhat, for the NGO, submitted that they represented the case of 60 children they knew whose names have been excluded from the NRC. “All their documents were shown. Despite this, their names were not found in the final NRC list. Their parents’ names are there in the list. Will these children be sent to detention camps"" Ms. Bhat asked the court.

Chief Justice Bobde said the issue was very serious.

Mr. Venugopal intervened, saying “children excluded from NRC whose parents have been given citizenship will not be sent to detention centres in Assam”.

The application said “the unreasonable manner in which children have been excluded from the NRC Final List even when their parents are included is in direct contravention of the State’s obligation towards children as envisaged under Article 15 (3), Article 39 (e) & (f), Article 45 and Article 47 of the Constitution of India, and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015”.

The NGO submitted that the NRC had identified “specific categories of already marginalised persons” who had been excluded. These included children excluded from the NRC final list even as their parents and relatives were included; orphaned children excluded from the NRC who did not reside in State orphanages or homes; children excluded from the NRC who were from disconnected families and stayed with close or distant relatives; and parents excluded from the NRC when children were included.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/6qwzo6/article25899936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-supreme-court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dont-send-children-excluded-from-assam-nrc-to-detention-camps-supreme-court/article30495458.ece
71,2020/01/06,"CAA-NPR-NRC is sinister plan to divide country, says Chidambaram","Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Monday asserted that the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) was a ‘sinister and mischievous plan’ to divide the country and was part of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-Bharatiya Janata Party effort to push its agenda of a ‘Hindu Rashtra’.

The ‘trinity’ of NRC-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA)-National Population Register (NPR) would directly affect the Muslims as any other community, even if they were left out in the NRC, would be included through the CAA, contended the Congress leader, briefing mediapersons at the party headquarters.

“The NRC is a sinister and mischievous plan to divide India. Under the NRC, every person residing in India has to prove that he is a citizen of India. In modern, liberal democracies, citizenship is based on the principle of territoriality,” he said.

“Naturally, there is widespread fear and uncertainty among the Muslims of India,” the former Finance Minister added.

“The NRC-CAA-NPR exercise is part of the RSS-BJP plan to push its divisive agenda of a Hindu Rashtra. The Constitution of India embodies the values of equality, equal protection of the laws, secularism, humanism and constitutional morality. In order to protect these values, every patriotic Indian has the duty to fight the pernicious doctrine of Hindu Rashtra,” asserted the senior Congress leader.

Terming the CAA ‘patently discriminatory’, he said three neighbouring countries have been included while Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bhutan had been excluded and some minority groups, including Muslims, kept out of its ambit.

Mr. Chidamabaram, who was the Home Minister when the UPA had updated the NPR in 2010, claimed that there was a ‘world of difference’ between the NPR of 2010 and the proposed NPR of 2020.

“NPR 2010 was conducted in a few States when there was no controversy about NRC and without the unhappy experience of the Assam NRC,” he said.

“NPR 2020 will ask for information on the last place of residence, the place of birth of the parents, voter identity, passport number, driver’s licence, PAN and Aadhaar. Who added these additional fields and why,” asked Mr. Chidambaram. “ In terms of text and context, NPR 2010 and NPR 2020 are very different. NPR 2020 with the additional fields is a disguised attempt to do an Assam NRC-like exercise throughout the country and therefore, it must be stoutly opposed.”

Commenting on the protests by people over the CAA-NRC, the Congress leader also said thousands of people, especially students, were on the streets to protect the Constitution given by Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Babasaheb Ambedkar.

“Abraham Lincoln saved the Constitution of the United States in 1865; our task and our duty are not different,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/r7zlbx/article30496755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-chidambaram-pti-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/national-register-of-citizens-is-a-mischievous-plan-to-divide-india-says-chidambaram/article30495158.ece
72,2020/01/06,NPR data will be collected in Odisha in April-May,"Come April, you need to answer when and where your parents were born. The National Population Register exercise, which has been initiated in Odisha, will have some additional questions about parents.

The data for the NPR, widely dubbed by the Opposition parties a step towards preparing the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC), will be captured between April 16 and May 31 in the State.

The NPR exercise is being taken up though the Naveen Patnaik government had earlier announced that it would not implement the NRC. Mr. Patnaik had said his government was not opposed to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 since it deals with only foreign nationals. The West Bengal and the Kerala governments have already put the NPR exercise on hold.

The NPR 2010 required enumerators to fill up 14 fields whereas the number of fields remains the same in 2020. But fields have been rephrased and additional information has been sought within some specific field.

In 2010, enumerators preparing the NPR and household schedule had only asked people to name their father, mother and spouse in full and if they were alive or not. The 2020-NPR, however, wants people to give date and place of birth of their parents and specific place if born outside country.

The new feature is requirement of four basic identity proofs — the Aaadhar number, the mobile number, the voter ID card number and the driving licence number. This time, people will also be asked to name their mother tongue.

No authority wanted to come on record to explain the necessity of adding the features. Requesting anonymity, they said it is part of the nationwide exercise and the questions have been rephrased for smooth filling up of boxes in the mobile application.

In Odisha, the NPR piloting has been carried out in three places at Pattamundai in Kendrapara district, Bhubaneswar in Khordha and Puintala in Balangir district in August. The format used during the piloting would be retained during the April-May exercise, said an official.

Master trainers have already given orientation and training for carrying out the NPR work in Odisha. Field enumerators would be trained in March just before the NPR and house-listing would take place in April. For better understanding of enumerators, the NPR sheet would be translated in Odia.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ve7h1d/article30495048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-NPR-JOTHIRAMALINGAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/npr-data-will-be-collected-in-odisha-in-april-may/article30495049.ece

74,2020/01/06,JNU attack ‘yet another reminder of growing intolerance in India’: Pakistan Foreign Minister,"Needling India, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Monday alleged that the attack on students and teachers at the prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is “yet another reminder of growing intolerance” in the country.

Nearly 35 students were taken to hospitals on Sunday evening after a violent mob ran amok, attacking students and damaging property on the varsity campus in New Delhi.

“Chilling attack on students & teachers at #JNU yesterday is yet another reminder of growing intolerance in India. Campuses in India now face unchecked wrath of RSS mobs while the police collude with their insanity. This is what happens when you empower fascist ideology,” Mr. Qureshi tweeted.

He also said that Pakistan wants peace, stability and security in region, and it was very clear on its position.

“We stand for peace, stability & security in region. I’ve reiterated this to all stakeholders in my recent conversations. Active diplomacy to de-escalate tensions is the need of the hour. Violence must be avoided. We’ll continue with efforts,” he said.

Also, the Foreign Office (FO) on Monday called on the Indian government to protect its minorities from what it called “saffron terror”.

The FO remarks came a day after India on Sunday strongly condemned the “targeted killing” of a minority Sikh community member in Peshawar, an incident that took place in the backdrop of an attack on Nankana Sahib Gurdwara in Pakistan.

In a statement, the FO said the BJP government was using incidents of alleged persecution of minorities in Pakistan to divert attention from the situation in “Kashmir and discrimination against minorities within India.”

“The RSS-inspired BJP government has absolutely no credentials even to pretend that it is a protector of minorities,” the statement read.

“Rather than feigning any dishonest concern for minorities elsewhere, the BJP government would do better by focusing on the ongoing human tragedy at home and protecting India’s minorities from ‘saffron terror’,” it added.

Unknown gunmen shot dead 25-year-old Sikh man, identified as Rowinder Singh of Shangla district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, weeks before his marriage in the northwestern city of Peshawar, drawing sharp condemnation from India which demanded exemplary punishment to the perpetrators of the crime.

The killing of Singh came a day after a mob attacked Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Lahore where Sikhism founder Guru Nanak Dev was born.

75,2020/01/06,ED issues alert on extortion rackets,"The Enforcement Directorate has come across about half-a-dozen cases in which unscrupulous elements impersonated as Agency officials with the intention of extorting money.

“We have got FIRs (First Information Reports) registered with the local police in different parts of the country for stringent legal action against the imposters. One person has been arrested in a case, in which the accused had sent an email using an ID similar to that of an ED official,” said a senior Agency official on Monday.

‘Spoofing’ technique

One such case was also reported in 2017 when the Agency had a case registered with the Delhi Police. It was suspected that the caller ID “spoofing” technique had been used to show that the call had originated from the ED’s office.

In view of these incidents, the ED has issued a statement that the agency will continue to take action against such elements who “indulge in fake correspondences with the general public with an ulterior motive to extract money”.

The official said that in some cases, fake summonses and letters in the Agency’s name were issued. “On receipt of complaints of such a nature, the ED takes swift action by approaching the local police authorities and making complaints/FIRs,” said the Agency.

‘Report such cases’

Urging people to report such cases for necessary action, the ED said it had taken certain measures to check such criminal activities to prevent unscrupulous elements from harassing innocent persons.

“Such information can be shared through regional officers at Chandigarh (0172-2540465), Delhi (011-23210692), Mumbai (022-22614091), Chennai (044-28255051) and Kolkata (033-23378343). In case of any inconvenience, the victim can contact the Head Office (011-24692055) or email at dir-enforcement@nic.in,” said the agency.

CBI, too

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has also come across such cases in the recent past. Last month, the CBI arrested two persons, including one who had posed as the Agency’s chief to threaten Customs officials and dissuade them from pursuing a probe against three private companies.

The accused had used the “spoofing” technique to project that he was calling from the CBI Headquarters in Delhi.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-issues-alert-on-extortion-rackets/article30494504.ece
76,2020/01/06,Seek categorical assurance from Imran on safety of lives of minorities: Shiromani Akali Dal,"The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday urged External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar to seek a categorical assurance from Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the safety of assets and the lives of minorities.

A delegation led by SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal also asked the Minister to tell Pakistan that all those responsible for the hate attack on Sikhs and stoning of Gurdwara Janam Asthan in Nankana Sahib were arrested and punished.

The SAD president briefed the Minister about the grim situation saying even those looking after the gurdwaras were not safe. He urged urgent intervention at the highest level. “If anybody can attack Gurdwara Janam Asthan then no minority is safe in Pakistan,” he said in a statement.

The delegation also pointed out that the Pakistan government should be asked to take prompt and exemplary action in case any minority community is targeted in any manner. “Had the government acted decisively in the case of the attack on the Sikh community members at Gurdwara Janam Asthan and stoning of the gurdwara, it would not have set off the chain reaction which led to the killing of the Sikh youth in Peshawar,” he said.

The delegation members also conveyed to Dr. Jaishankar that the recent events in Pakistan had hurt the sentiments of the Sikh community worldwide. “Sikhs living in Pakistan had already said they were feeling insecure. Even our holiest shrine is not safe. In such a situation Pakistan should be asked to take concrete steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community as well as all other minorities living in Pakistan”, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m8h4wh/article30306080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUKHBIR-SINGH-BADAL-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/seek-categorical-assurance-from-imran-on-safety-of-lives-of-minorities-shiromani-akali-dal/article30494347.ece
77,2020/01/06,"'Young Indian' case: Supreme Court defers to March 17 final hearing of appeals filed by Sonia, Rahul","The Supreme Court on Monday deferred to March 17 the final hearing of appeals filed by Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi against a Delhi High Court decision to allow the Income-Tax department to re-open their tax assessments for 2011-12 in the Young Indian case.

A Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Hrishikesh Roy decided to first see the outcome of an Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) hearing concerning the issue, scheduled on February 28.

Justice Chandrachud said the appeals would be listed for final disposal on March 17.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the department was entitled to re-open the assessments. There was “tangible material” to justify the re-assessment move.

Justice Chandrachud said Mr. Mehta could urge the issue on the next date.

The ITAT had in November upheld the department’s withdrawal of ‘charitable’ status to Young Indian. Senior advocates P. Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal and Arvind Dattar, appearing for the Gandhis and senior Congress leader Oscar Fernandes, said the tribunal had not decided all the grounds challenged by them. Six grounds are yet to be decided and the hearing on this issue is scheduled for February.

One of the main arguments raised in the Supreme Court is that Young Indian (YI) is a charitable institution, i.e., a not-for-profit company incorporated under Section 25 of the pre-existing Companies Act (which now corresponds with Section 43 of the new Companies Act, 2013).

Mr. Rahul Gandhi, a shareholder of the non-profit and charitable company, argued that no income had in fact escaped assessment and that all queries were adequately addressed in the scrutiny assessment. As a shareholder of a non-profit company, he was under no obligation to disclose the value of his shares in the manner that the Revenue department has alleged.

The Delhi High Court had found that about ₹90 crore loan was due from the Associated Journal Limited (AJL), publishers of the newspaper National Herald to the All India Congress Committee. As the loan amount became irrecoverable, it was assigned to YI, a company in which the Gandhis were the majority shareholders, for ₹50 lakh.

The entire premise of the Income Tax reassessment notices was that the non-disclosure of the taxing event — allotment of Young Indian shares (and the absence of any declaration as to value) — had deprived the Assessing Officer (AO) of the opportunity to look into the records.

The probe was triggered by an investigation into a private criminal complaint filed by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy before a trial court in connection with the National Herald case.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/yhor45/article30494374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SONIAGANDHI-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/young-indian-case-sc-defers-to-march-17-final-hearing-of-appeals-filed-by-sonia-rahul/article30494262.ece

Speaking at the second national conference of the All India Working Journalists Association (AWJA) here, the Union Minister for Social Justice and Empowerment said the development of the Muslim community has been the stand of the Modi government even as he appealed to the community to stop their agitation against the amended law.

He said the Act was for minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who face religious persecution.

“The Narendra Modi government is for all. The CAA is not against the Indian Muslim community. This law is [to provide citizenship] for persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who came to India before 2014”, he said. .

“Therefore, I appeal to the Muslim community to stop the [ongoing] agitation. Your demands will be definitely looked into. The Narendra Modi government is not opposing the Muslim community. [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi is not opposing minorities,” he said.

The Union Minister further said that Mr. Modi has always believed in ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwaas (Together with all, for development of all and with trust of all)' and that is government’s motto.

Referring to the memorandum submitted by the AWJA seeking provisions that includethe legalisation of electronic media and a special ordinance to stop attacks on journalists, among other demands, the Union Minister said he supports these demands and would discuss them with the Central government and also with State governments.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wgxclt/article29889757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05RAMDASATHAWALE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-not-against-indian-muslims-modi-govt-is-for-all-minister/article30493936.ece
79,2020/01/06,Pending Mallya matters won’t affect lawsuits outside: Supreme Court,"The Supreme Court on Monday clarified that pending matters concerning fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya before it will not affect proceedings in “any case anywhere in the world”.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde passed the order after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said Mr. Mallya had cited cases pending in the Supreme Court of India to stall insolvency proceedings before a court in the United Kingdom.

“Mr. Mallya has been hanging the carrot of settlement before the State of Bank of India (SBI)-led banking consortium from whom loans were taken. Not a single rupee has come. The SBI has filed insolvency proceedings against Mr. Mallya in the U.K. Hearing is concluded. Now, he has said that a proposal is pending before the Supreme Court here… So, the U.K. court is waiting,” Mr. Mehta submitted.

The apex court should clarify that the pendency of any case here would not affect proceedings in the U.K. court, he said.

Mr. Mallya’s lawyer sought an adjournment. At this point, Chief Justice Bobde said an adjournment would be given, provided Mr. Mallya did not “use” the case in the apex court as a “cause” for stalling proceedings in other jurisdictions “anywhere in the world”.

In mid-2019, Mr. Mallya moved the apex court for a stay on the confiscation of properties owned by him and his relatives. He argued that only properties related to Kingfisher Airlines should be attached in connection with cases of alleged irregularities.

Mr. Mallya fled India in March 2016 and has been living in the United Kingdom since then.

In 2016, the consortium filed a contempt case against him for providing a“vague”statement about his assets despite an apex court order to facilitate the recovery of his debts worth over ₹ 6,000 crore.

The consortium then complained that Mr. Mallya failed to disclose his assets both to the court and his banks, especially the receipt of payment of $40 million out of a total $75 million (₹515 crore) from British liquor major Diageo Plc following his resignation as Chairman of United Spirits Limited in February 2016. It returned to the Supreme Court after the court ordered Mr. Mallya to reveal his complete riches to banks for the recovery of the total loan amount.

They contended that a disclosure statement of assets submitted by Mr. Mallya to the apex court in April and passed on to the banks for aiding them in the recovery of the loan did not contain a “whisper” about the details, forms and locations of his assets.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rydmcb/article30491700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06MALLYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pending-mallya-matters-wont-affect-lawsuits-outside-supreme-court/article30493758.ece
80,2020/01/06,"IMA condemns attack on doctors, nurses near JNU","The Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday issued a strongly worded statement condemning the attack on doctors and nurses by unknown people on Sunday near the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) when injured students were being given first-aid.

It said, “IMA condemns mindless violence on doctors and nurses who rushed to treat the injured in JNU”. It added: “If doctors and nurses are not safe in the capital of the country, it speaks volumes about the governance and lack of it. Time has come for the medical fraternity to devise its own arrangements for defence. How does that reflect on the nation, if it cannot protect its doctors and nurses reaching to the injured? Is this a civil war? What is the message that goes pout to the world?”

The IMA called for more protection for doctors and nurses. “IMA demands that the Union Home Ministry… ensure safety and security of doctors and nurses who reach out to the injured and wounded”, the statement said.

On Sunday, national president of the Progressive Medicos & Scientists Forum (PMSF) Dr. Harjit Singh Bhatti tweeted, “Our team of doctors, nurses & medical volunteers who reached JNU to give first aid to injured students & teachers was attacked by hundreds of goons. Mob manhandled doctors, nurses & threatened them. Our ambulance’s glass and windows broken…”

Doctors of the PMSF have for many weeks been attending to people injured in the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests across Delhi. On earlier occasions, doctors were prevented from providing first-aid to those injured in anti-CAA protest clashes.

On December 22, 2019, the IMA issued a statement condemning the police action of barging into a hospital in Mangaluru, charging at people injured in protests against the CAA and trying to force open the door of many wards. The police had also lobbed a tear gas inside the hospital close to the intensive care unit. Use of tear gas in confined spaces is prohibited as per international norms and standards.

Protection for medical staff

The latest IMA statement also mentions about the Union Home Ministry’s decision to block the Bill against violence on doctors and hospitals. After a series of attacks on doctors by the public, the Health Services Personnel and Clinical Establishments (Prohibition of Violence and Damage to Property) Bill, 2019, seeking to punish those who assault doctors and other healthcare professionals on duty, was drafted. The Bill, which proposed a jail term of up to 10 years, was dismissed by the Home Ministry during an inter-ministerial consultation over the draft law. The Law Ministry had approved it.

The Home Ministry opposed the Bill on the grounds that there could not be separate law to protect members of a particular profession. It maintained that there should be no specific law for a particular profession, and the IPC and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) were sufficient to deal with it.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kq2j9f/article30493638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMA-LOGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ima-condemns-attack-on-healthcare-workers-during-jnu-violence/article30493639.ece

Trade unions INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF, UTUC along with various sectoral independent federations and associations had adopted a declaration in September last to go on a nationwide strike on January 8, 2020.

“We expect participation of not less than 25 crore of working people in the forthcoming National General Strike on January 8, 2020, to be followed by many more actions seeking reversal of the anti-worker, anti-people, anti-national policies of the Government.

“The Ministry of Labour has failed to assure on any of the demands of workers which called a meeting on January 2, 2020. The attitude of the government is that of contempt towards labour as we construe from its policies and actions,” the 10 central trade unions (CTUs) said in a joint statement.

About 60 organisations of students and elected office bearers of some universities have also decided to join the strike with an agenda to raise voice against increased fee structure and commercialization of education, it said.

The trade unions condemned the JNU violence and similar incidents in other university campuses and expressed their solidarity with students and teachers all over India.

The unions also expressed displeasure over no Indian Labour Conference being held since July 2015, codification of labour laws and privatisation of PSUs.

“As many as 12 airports are already sold out to private hands, 100 per cent sale of Air India is already decided, decision to sell BPCL taken, BSNL-MTNL merger announced and 93,600 telecom workers already thrown out of jobs under the garb of VRS (voluntary retirement scheme),” it added.

The unions are also against privatisation in railways, corporatisation of 49 defence production units and forced merger of banks.

According to media reports, a violent mob had attacked the Gurdwara and pelted it with stones on Friday. A team of police had to intervene briskly to control the situation.

The accused, identified as Imran, was arrested on Sunday for his role in the incident, Geo News reported.

Azhar Mashwani, the Focal Person (Digital Media) to Punjab Chief Minister, took to Twitter to announce the arrest.

“The main culprit in #NankanaSahib incident Imran has been arrested. An FIR has been registered at Nankana Police Station,” he said in the tweet which also carries the picture of the accused behind bars.

He further said that the accused has been booked under a non bailable section under the Anti Terrorism Act”.

Breaking his silence on the incident, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday condemned the recent incident, saying it goes against his “vision” and the government will show “zero tolerance” against those involved in it.

India has strongly condemned the incident of vandalism at the revered Gurdwara and called upon the Pakistan government to take immediate steps to ensure the safety and security of the Sikh community there.

On Saturday, Indian leaders cutting across party lines and various outfits condemned the mob attack on the historic Gurdwara, terming it as “cowardly” and “shameful“.

Hundreds of protesters thronged the streets near the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi demanding that Islamabad provide adequate security to Sikh shrines and community members there.

Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandhak Committee (SGPC), the apex body which manages Sikh shrines in India, said it will send a four-member delegation to Pakistan to take stock of the situation and urged the Pakistan government to take stringent action against the culprits who attacked the gurdwara - one of the holiest sites in Sikhism.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pi3l0i/article30472530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NankanaSahib,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/main-accused-in-nankana-sahib-vandalism-held-in-pakistan/article30492388.ece

Describing it as an act committed by “the masked goons affiliated to ABVP having the patronage of the Union Government,” the statement said, “the visuals and media reports describing the hostage-like situation at JNU on Sunday night, wherein students were locked in their hostel rooms for four hours and a state-guarded mob went on a rampage are extremely threatening and shameful.”

“This vandalism is a blot on the constitutional democracy of India. The entry of men and women holding lathis, rods and other weapons on to the campus, beating students, attacking media fraternity and yet the police acting as silent spectators for hours raises serious questions on the intent and conduct of police,” said M. Salman Imtiaz, president, AMUSU (2018-2019).

He said the state patronage of the violence was evident from the failure of the police to arrest the people from the unruly mob. “It is apparent that the mob was duly guarded by the police, and had a sanction to roam across the campus and beat whosoever they meet,” he said.

Mr. Imtiaz said he would meet the injured in the AIIMS and join the protest march in Delhi on Monday. He said AMUSU saluted the courage of JNUSU President Aishe Goshe and called upon students across India to stand in support of JNU.

The statement further demanded that “the Supreme Court of India take cognisance of the state-sponsored violence and takes immediate steps to fix the responsibility.”

Earlier, Aligarh Muslim University Teachers’ Association also condemned the brutalities committed against the students of JNU on Sunday night.

Among those who attended the meeting at Grand Hyatt on Sunday evening were Central Board of Film Certification chairman Prasoon Joshi, music composer Anu Malik, singers Kailash Kher and Shaan, T-Series chairman and managing director Bhushan Kumar, filmmakers Vipul Shah, Kunal Kohli and Abhishek Kapoor, actress Urvashi Rautela, and writer Reena Rathod.

As the attendees entered the hotel in Santacruz, over 50 people stood outside the gates in protest against the meeting. The protesters sang verses from Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s ‘Hum Dekhenge’ and shouted slogans like, “Aya ek Nazi, laya NRC (a Nazi has come, he has brought the National Register of Citizens with him).”

Bilal Khan, a protester and resident of Chembur, said, “Bollywood celebrities are people fans look up to. This protest is to remind them that if they do not stand for the right thing, people might refrain from watching their movies.”

As the protesters distributed greeting cards and roses to the police present at the venue, some also demanded that the celebrities come out of the hotel and have a conversation with them. “If the government is not afraid of coming up with CAA and NRC, then why are they afraid of facing the general public?” asked Lara Jesai, an advocate at Bombay High Court.

Another protester, Amrita Ham Ray, accused the government of using Bollywood celebrities to influence the common man. “We don’t want Bollywood to promote the Bharatiya Janata Party’s ideology,” she said.

Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi tweeted with the hash tag #SOSJNU.

“The brutal attack on JNU students & teachers by masked thugs, that has left many seriously injured, is shocking. The fascists in control of our nation, are afraid of the voices of our brave students. Today’s violence in JNU is a reflection of that fear,” Mr. Gandhi said on Twitter.

The BJP hit back at the Opposition and accused it of politicising campuses. “We strongly condemn the violence on JNU campus. This is a desperate attempt by forces of anarchy, who are determined to use students as cannon fodder, create unrest to shore up their shrinking political footprint. Universities should remain places of learning and education,” the BJP’s official handle tweeted.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who has been a former president of the JNU students’ union, alleged that the violence on the campus was part of the Hindutva agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

“Reports coming from JNU point to a collusion between the administration and goons of ABVP to inflict violence on students and teachers. It is a planned attack by those in power, which is afraid of the resistance provided by JNU to its Hindutva agenda,” Mr. Yechury tweeted.

“Masked attackers entered JNU while law enforcers stood by. This video is what RSS/BJP want to convert India to. They will not be allowed to succeed,” he added and tagged the video that showed the JNU Students Union president badly bleeding.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, both of whom were former JNU students, condemned the attack. “Horrifying images from JNU — the place I know & remember was one for fierce debates & opinions but never violence. I unequivocally condemn the events of today. This govt, regardless of what has been said the past few weeks, wants universities to be safe spaces for all students,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

“Have seen pictures of what is happening in #JNU. Condemn the violence unequivocally. This is completely against the tradition and culture of the university,” Mr. Jaishankar tweeted.

Former Union Minister P. Chidambaram questioned the role of the police in allowing the violence. “What we are seeing on live TV is shocking and horrifying. Masked men enter JNU hostels and attack students. What is the police doing? Where is the Police Commissioner? If it is happening on live TV, it is an act of impunity and can only happen with the support of the government. This is beyond belief,” said Mr. Chidambaram in a statement.

Condemning the attack, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said a Trinamool delegation will visit JNU to express solidarity with the students. “We strongly condemn brutality unleashed agst students/teachers in JNU. No words enough to describe such heinous acts. A shame on our democracy,” she said.

Former Uttar Pradesh CM Akhilesh Yadav blamed the BJP for the violence. “Masked men attacking teachers and students in JNU shows the low to which the government will stoop in order to rule through fear. The ABVP are acting like the storm troopers of the BJP,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bk0qfk/article30488996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-STUDENTPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/attack-in-jnu-campus-fascists-afraid-of-students-says-rahul-gandhi/article30488997.ece
89,2020/01/06,Attack in JNU campus: Teachers allege administration colluded with attackers,"Hours after violence broke out at the JNU campus on Sunday, teachers raised questions on the university’s security and alleged that the administration was hand in glove with the attackers.

They also said the violence had left students petrified.

Heavy police deployment was made outside the campus after masked men armed with sticks entered the university and attacked students and teachers, leaving many injured. Teachers spoke to mediapersons from inside the university gate.

Mahalaxmi, a History Department professor in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said teachers had organised a peace meet at the Sabarmati T-point at 5 pm.

“As soon as it got over, we saw that a large number of people entered the campus and they started arbitrarily attacking teachers and students.

“Apparently, they had been told to attack certain teachers and students and that is what they did. They did not stop at that, they were just roaming freely with sticks and beating people with impunity,” she said.

The professor said students are under great stress and petrified.

“So if this is the situation inside the campus which is being manned by a number of police and security personnel and if this happens, how will you explain the situation. It means that the administration is hand in glove with these people,” she said.

At least 28 people, including JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh, were injured and admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) as chaos reigned on the campus for nearly two hours.

The JNU administration called in police to restore law and order.

Pradeep Shinde, a Labour Studies professor, said the biggest question was how a large number of armed people entered the campus.

“How did such a large number of people, armed with rods, enter the campus, that is what we are wondering. I think they were political activists instigated by the people who always call us anti-nationals,” he said.

He said students are protesting against fee hike.

“If the fee hike is accepted, half of the university will be vacant as they (students) will have to go home. So these people are fighting to save public education. Instead of appreciating them, these people are attacking us and calling us anti-nationals,” he added.

For over two months now, JNU students have been protesting the administration’s decision to hike the hostel fee. Students have also been boycotting classes as part of the protest.

In a statement, the JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) said it condemns the orgy of violence that was unleashed in JNU “with the connivance of the JNU administration with the police standing by as mute spectators“.

“Mobs not only went around hostels attacking several students, severely injuring many of them, a JNUTA meeting called to appeal for peace on campus was also attacked by a mob of masked people with stones and sticks,” it said.

A teacher suffered head injuries and had to be hospitalised, the JNUTA said, adding that cars of several teachers were also smashed.

The JNUTA held the varsity administration “singularly responsible” for the grave situation.

“It is a product of its (administration’s) desperation in the light of its failure to resolve the crisis created by its high-handed imposition of a fee hike. Students have been on an agitation for over 70 days and the VC’s obstinacy has prevented any resolution,” it said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pk22tf/article30486341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sucharita-Sen-JNU-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-violence-teachers-raise-question-on-universitys-security-allege-admin-colluded-with-attackers/article30488517.ece

91,2020/01/06,Bandh call evokes good response in Vizag Agency,"The two-day bandh call given by the Agency Joint Action Committee, comprising various tribal organisations evoked good response on the first day on Monday.

The JAC had given the call demanding the implementation of 1/70 Act and booking of cases against the violators of the Act.

For scheduled areas, Andhra Pradesh has a Land Transfer Regulation Act 1 of 1970, which is popularly known as the 1/70 Act. The Act checks the transfer of tribal land to non-tribal persons with due regard to the special status that the Constitution provides to the tribal persons and their land.

The members of the Agency JAC alleged that there had been gross violation of the Act in regard to allotting mining leases in the scheduled areas to non-tribal persons and allowing non-tribal persons to own benami houses, lodges and hotels in various parts of Agency, especially where there is a huge tourist flow.

Speaking to The Hindu from Araku, Kilo Surendra, member of the JAC and former Araku ZPTC, said, “Many non-tribal persons own and run mines and hotels and lodges by having a benami tribal as an owner in the front. They are reaping profits without giving back anything for the development of the tribal area.”

As per a survey made in 2008, there were about 650 such unauthorised cases in Araku alone and over 2,000 across the 11 mandals in the Agency, he said.

“About 10 years ago, a Special Deputy Collector was posted in the Agency to tackle such cases, but the post is lying vacant,” he lamented.

‘Withdraw quota list’

The JAC members also demanded that the government immediately withdraw the ZPTC reservation list for local body elections, as despite being a Schedule Five area, non of the seats have been reserved for tribals.

They also demanded the implementation of GO number 3, which reserves jobs for tribal youth in the Agency area.

People across the 11 mandals joined the bandh call voluntarily. Most of the shops and hotels remained closed and APSRTC buses were off the road.

Private vehicles, except a few, were also not allowed by the members who blocked the road at all entry points such as Araku and Paderu ghat roads and the Narsipatnam route.

Visakhpatnam Superintendent of Police Attada Babujee said the bandh was largely peaceful.

Tourists from West Bengal, Odisha and other States who were unaware of the bandh, were caught unawares.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/l2qxwp/article30495960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07ONG5JACSTAGINGPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bandh-call-evokes-good-response-in-vizag-agency/article30495961.ece

Mr. Sawhney said it was not only having a cosmopolitan culture but also had a hub of industries. It had a combination of industrial hub and a vibrant startup ecosystem. “It has beautiful beaches, hills, forests, tribal people and the presence of naval establishment,” he said.

Addressing a meeting after launching an MBA programme in blended learning mode on digital governance and management at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Visakhapatnam, here on Monday, Mr. Sawhney said digital transformation would bring about a significant change in the quality of life.

Citing examples of Estonia and New Zealand, he said people in those countries are not in a need of visiting government offices for various services.

Mr. Sawhney said various applications were being used by the Government of India to deliver services such as soil health prediction, cropping pattern and required inputs on insurance products, irrigation, seeds and warehousing to the agriculture sector. Similarly, efforts are being made to improve services in other sectors.

“In next five to 10 years, a sea change is expected due to advent of technologies such as artificial intelligence, predictive analysis, cloud based services, Internet of Things, blockchain and robotics,” said Mr. Sawhney.

18-month course

Twenty seven executives working in various firms have been admitted to the 18-month course introduced under the aegis of the National e-Governance Division (NEGD) under the MeitY, he added.

Participating in the programme, Meghalaya Chief Secretary M.S. Rao said in data-driven society, access to Internet has become a legitimate right. He also pointed out how the Kerala High Court has given a judgment, making it a fundamental right to have smart phones and other gadgets which has become essential for a comfortable living.

Digital India

The subsidised meal is served at the canteen on the premises. The actual cost is ₹34 per plate.,

Many petitioners, who come from faraway places such as Parvatipuram, Bobbili, Gummalakshmipuram and Saluru, used to spend huge amounts at private hotels, and some of them who could not afford, even used to skip meal.

Assembly N. Chandrababu Naidu asked the YSRCP government to unleash its anger, if any, on him and spare the Amaravati Capital Region. He invited the government to order an inquiry into alleged insider trading by the TDP government if they want to act and not resort to shifting the capital citing insider trading as a reason.

On Monday Mr. Naidu visited the 24-hour hunger strike camp by Vijayawada East MLA Gadde Rammohan Rao in the city in a show of solidarity with the farmers fighting against the relocation of the State Capital. CPI national leader K. Narayana also visited the camp and extended support to Mr. Rao.

‘People won’t forgive’

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Naidu said the Capital Region and the State would not forgive YSRCP and its leaders if they continue to go on with the plans of shifting the capital to Visakhapatnam.

“People from various walks of life in Kurnool, Nellore, Ongole, and other districts have formed Joint Action Committees expressing solidarity with the capital farmers and opposing shifting the capital to Visakhapatnam,” Mr. Naidu pointed out.

Buildings enough for govt. functioning

He said about ₹ 10, 000 crore has already been spent in Amaravati for construction of several buildings. If the YSRCP government cannot develop it further, it can just keep using the existing buildings which will be enough to house all the government functionaries.

Regarding the issue surrounding his alleged comments against Commissioner and Director of Municipal Administration G.S.R.K.R. Vijay Kumar, Mr. Naidu denied disrespecting the former. I always respect officials, unlike CM Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, of whom officers are scared,” he quipped.

Death due to capital shift?

They already filed the ARR and tariff proposals in December 2019.

While reviewing the preparedness for the public hearings, on Sunday, APERC Chairman Justice C.V.

The commission also attached due priority to nine-hour free power supply to the farm sector during day time and ensuring the right mix of power from various sources in the total portfolio to optimise the power purchase costs.

Justice Nagarjuna Reddy observed that the commission viewed the consumers as a pivot in the whole tariff exercise and the public hearings were meant to ensure transparency in fixing tariffs.

He further said the power utilities should focus on new initiatives and technologies and best practices being adopted in advanced countries for improving capabilities and achieving efficiencies in power generation, distribution and consumption.

Besides, emphasis should be laid on energy conservation and energy efficiency measures, he exhorted.

Launching a signature collection campaign here on Sunday, TDP leaders along with Communist Party of India district secretary D.

Jagadeesh, former Mayor Madamanchi Swaroopa, and former Anantapur Urban MLA Vykuntam Prabhakar Chowdary pitched a tent opposite the old RDO Office in the city to collect one lakh signatures against the proposal to relocate the capital.

Regional Joint Director (School Education) M. Venkatakrishna Reddy and his Intermediate counterpart Karanam Chandrasekhar Rao told The Hindu that they have banned all proposals of excursions involving students from Anantapur schools and junior colleges with immediate effect.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, meanwhile, sanctioned ₹5 lakh compensation to Basha Fakruddin’s parents following his death in an accident in Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka on Friday night.

The RJD said that in the Kadiri school incident, while permission was taken only for Class IX students, the teachers had taken students from Classes VIII and X as well. Also, instead of booking only APSRTC buses, teachers from Vikas Model School and Kadiri Government School had booked private buses which is against the rules.

In another case, a school from Gorantla went ahead with an excursion despite not being accorded permission to do so. Students were taken to Chennai and they are yet to return, sources said.

In the Kadiri incident, there was only one bus driver instead of two. He was also driving in an inebriated condition, according to initial reports. An inquiry is in progress into the Palamaner accident too.

According to the Kuppam police, Karthikeyan of Adavibuduguru village had settled in Chennai several years ago as a daily wager. He later became friends with Siva Kumar and his wife in recent years. Police said that a few months ago, Karthikeyan reportedly shot an objectionable video of Siva Kumar’s wife without her consent and later blackmailed her.

When Siva Kumar came to know of the matter, he and his wife reportedly hatched a plan to kill Karthikeyan.

Some days later, Karthikeyan invited the couple to his village near Kuppam on a holiday. The couple then allegedly plotted Karthikeyan’s murder, and accompanied him to Adavibuduguru village all the way from Chennai.

When they neared the village, Siva Kumar and his wife allegedly murdered Karthikeyan and buried his body in a pit.

Last week, the Chennai police, who visited Adavibuduguru village to investigate the case, returned after failing to find the body. After the couple’s arrest, the Chennai police visited the village again on Sunday. The Kuppam police assisted their Chennai counterparts in arranging post-mortem of Karthikeyan’s body at the spot of the offence. Later, the body was handed over to their family members.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tn-police-exhume-youths-body-near-kuppam/article30488540.ece
105,2020/01/06,Unprecedented rush for Vaikunta Ekadasi festival,"The sacred shrine of Lord Venkateswara witnessed unprecedented crowds on Sunday on the eve of Vaikunta Ekadasi festival.

While the second ghat road leading to the shrine witnessed heavy traffic throughout the day, both trekking routes witnessed a continuous flow of pilgrims beginning from the early hours.

According to estimates, over 50,000 pilgrims trekked to the Tirumala temple on foot on Sunday alone.

By noon, it was chock-a-block as the darshan lines spilled out of the massive Vaikuntam complex to the Narayanagiri gardens and from thereon to the mada streets encircling the sacred shrine.

Temporary sheds built using German technology all along the mada streets came in helpful for devotees as showers lashed the town since morning.

The TTD Nitya Annadanam personnel faced a tough time supplying free food packets, milk and water bottles to the waiting devotees in the darshan lines. Dozens of cartons of drinking water bottles were dumped at every waiting shed.

Senior officials who were specially deputed for the purpose and assigned duties were seen moving constantly along the darshan lines interacting with the devotees and meeting their requirements.

The rush was so huge that the TTD authorities were forced to appeal to the devotees through its public broadcasting system to not join the darshan lines any further. Officials urged the devotees to join the darshan lines on Monday afternoon for the Dwadasi darshan on Tuesday.

Decked up

Meanwhile, the entire temple complex was tastefully decorated with flowers and colourful lights befitting the auspicious occasion.

The temple will be opened at 12.30 a.m. on Monday soon after the completion of Dhanurmasam and other mandatory pre-dawn rituals followed by the opening of the celestial ‘Vaikunta Dwaram’ at 2.00 a.m.

On the other hand, incidents of police excesses marred the festive spirit. Pilgrims were forced to alight only at a select few points and were forced to walk for long distances along with their luggage. This apart, restrictions were imposed on the movement of taxis and cabs, further adding to the woes of pilgrims.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hmwoe2/article30488526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06-VJ-TIRUMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/unprecedented-rush-for-vaikunta-ekadasi-festival/article30488527.ece
106,2020/01/06,A treat for birdwatchers at Pulicat Lake,"The usual calm of the Pulicat Lake was drowned in a relentless chorus of camera clicks on Sunday as birdwatchers flocked to witness migratory birds take flight on the last day of the annual Flamingo Festival.

People watched in awe as over three lakh birds converged at the lake, including over 40,000 flamingos, with officials saying that the number of arrivals this time had risen compared to previous years.

Visitors appreciated the arrangements at Sullurpeta, Nelapattu, Atakanithippa and Bhimunivaripalem and got to know about the flora and fauna of the coastal lagoons in detail.

Painted storks, Large and Little egrets, Grey pelicans, Grey herons and water birds like Northern pintails, Black-winged stilts, Northern shovellers, Common teal, Seagulls, Terns, Sandpipers, and Common coots arrived in large numbers at the lake, which is the second largest brackish water ecosystem in the country after Chilika Lake in Odisha. Apart from being a favoured destination for winged visitors, Pulicat Lake also supports a rich biodiversity and high biomass of fishes, prawns, crustaceans, coelenterates and planktons.

Migratory bird species visit the sanctuary year after year and their numbers soared in view of congenial weather condition this year. The birds that were spotted included cormorants, White ibises, Spoonbills, Egrets, Reef herons, Spot-billed ducks, Northern shovellers, Northern pintails, Sandpipers, Gulls and River terns.

The Forest Department arranged binoculars for nature lovers to view the birds in action and screened educative films on snakes and birds to enable people to know more about the habitat of the winged visitors. Birds from foreign lands arrived well in advance since September this year and are expected to stay till March-end to raise their offspring before returning to their homelands.

Pulicat and its surroundings are also home to invertebrates like prawns, planktons, coelenterates, annelids, molluscs, echinoderms, and reptiles like monitor lizard, cobra, Russell’s viper, and Indian krait, and schools of fish like Sable fish, Sargin fish, White, Black and Silver pomfret.

Environment Minister Balineni Srinivasa Reddy released an informative booklet on the natural habitat of terrestrial and aquatic birds. Cultural programmes were organised to entertain the tourists who had come different parts of the country as well as from other countries.

Snake shows were organised at Nelapattu and Atakanithippa.

107,2020/01/06,When a modern crematorium was redesigned to suit beliefs,"The design of a modern gas-based crematorium constructed to perform last rites in an environment-friendly manner in Shivamogga district that has given birth to rationalists like poet laureate Kuvempu, has now been changed owing to the prevailing beliefs related to performance of death rituals.

To avoid the usage of firewood for burning of the dead, Shivamogga City Corporation constructed a gas-based crematorium at its cremation ground on the banks of the Tunga at Vidya Nagar in 2014. A sum of ₹80 lakh was spent for the purpose.

The burning chamber of the crematorium was designed such that the head of the deceased faced the east and the feet faced the west, which was deemed scripturally inappropriate for ‘Apara Karma’, the rituals related to last rites. It is said that a few priests had advised against using this crematorium.

Owing to this, the public showed reluctance to use the crematorium. There were no takers even for the offer by the corporation to allow cremation for free. Instead, the public preferred to perform the last rites by creating a traditional firewood pyre on the same premises by paying a fee of ₹1,800. For a few days, the gas-based crematorium was used to burn unclaimed dead bodies. The machinery in the crematorium had developed a technical problem in March 2017 and was shut since then. As the crematorium was not utilised by the public, the corporation had also not shown any interest in immediate repair work.

The corporation then passed a resolution in June 2017 to alter the design of the crematorium as per the norms related to Apara Karma. Speaking to The Hindu, S.N. Channabasappa, Deputy Mayor, said that ₹3 lakh has been spent to alter the design and the direction of the burning chamber has been changed.

He said that technical glitches in the crematorium have also been resolved. As beliefs and emotions are involved while performing last rites, the corporation decided to change the design as per public demand. Moreover, since the gas-based crematorium was constructed as part of go-green initiative of the corporation, the redesign exercise was taken up. The crematorium is open to public, he added.

Kanthesh Kadaramandalagi, theatre activist and rationalist, told The Hindu called the entire exercise of redesigning a wastage of taxpayers’ money. It is another case of a government project becoming redundant owing to its execution without considering the needs of the users, he added.

The work of changing the design of the crematorium, the direction of the burning chamber and repairing the machinery there, was executed by a Hyderabad-based private firm.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/63c4s6/article30497331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGCREMATORIUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/when-a-modern-crematorium-was-redesigned-to-suit-beliefs/article30497333.ece
108,2020/01/06,Spiralling onion prices help this farmer earn ₹42 lakh,"The spiralling prices of onions have brought tears of joy for this farmer of Kolhar village of Basavanabagewadi taluk. Maleppa Baragi a traditional onion farmer has earned a whopping ₹42 lakh by selling onions cultivated on a ten acre farm in the village.

Though he has around 30 acres of land, he has reserved ten for onion cultivation for several years now. “Thanks to the good price of onions in the market this year, I have earned an unexpected profit. Never in my life have I earned this much from onions,” he said.

Speaking to The Hindu, he said that he sold each quintal for onion in Vijayapura market for ₹6,000 which is extremely high compared to previous years. However, because of the excess rain that the district received, some of the crop got wasted.

“In normal conditions, an acre of land should yield around 12 quintals of onion on my land. But this time, because of excess rains, the yield got reduced by around two quintals per acre. If there were no excess rains, then the yield and profit would have been higher,” Mr. Baragi said.

The farmer, though happy over making a huge profit, says that rarely does luck turn in favour of farmers.

“Just last year, I sold each quintal of onion for only ₹500 which is too less for a farmer. I had spent around ₹5 lakh on cultivation, and I earned only ₹3 lakh. Who will pay for the loss we incur,” he asked.

Admitting that the high price of onion put a financial burden on consumers, Mr. Baragi held the government responsible for the imbalanced situation that puts either farmer or consumer in a fix.

“The government should fix price of onion and purchase through procurement centres. Even if the government fixes ₹2,000 per quintal for onion, it will not only help the farmers to earn profit, at the same time, it would be economical for the consumers also. Otherwise, this disparity will continue to haunt either the farmers or consumers”, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tt93y4/article30497324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGVIJAYAPURAONION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/spiralling-onion-prices-help-this-farmer-earn-42-lakh/article30497326.ece
109,2020/01/06,BJP confusing nation on NRC: Raju Algur,"Accusing BJP of confusing the nation on the implementation of NRC, District Congress Committee president and former MLA Raju Algur said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were making contradictory statements on the NRC.

Addressing presspersons on Monday, he said that while Mr. Modi said that NRC was never discussed at any stage, Mr. Shah not only declared that NRC would be implemented but also explained the chronology of its implementation. “This means that both of them are only creating divide and using double standards. In any case, the Congress will continue to oppose NRC and CAA,” he said.

Stating that NRC had already failed miserably in Assam despite the huge amount of time and money spent, Mr. Algur said it would be a completely futile exercise if the BJP planned to implement it in other states. Claiming that India has over 15 crore homeless people, he wondered how they would show any documents to prove their citizenship.

Trying to dispel the notion that NRC would affect only Muslims, he said that when it would be implemented, every Indian citizen will have to stand in queues to prove their citizenship.

“It will be a huge financial burden on the government and a huge torture for Indians as they will have to collect documents to prove their citizenship despite being in India for generations,” he said. He said even if the government believes that a particular number of illegal migrants are living in India, they could be easily identified and suitable action could be taken against them. “What is the need to trouble 130 crore Indians only to identify some intruders,” he asked.

Mr. Algur said that they wanted to hold a massive rally against CAA and NRC, but since the District Police was refusing permission, they have no choice but to convey their message through media.

“We assure the police that our protest would be completely peaceful and we will organise it any given day by the police,” he said.

110,2020/01/06,Savitribai Phule Jayanti celebrated in Belagavi,"Manava Bandhutva Vedike celebrated Savitribai Phule Jayanti, the birth anniversary of the 19th crusader of women’s education, here.

Satish Jarkiholi, MBV founder, spoke on the life and times of the Phule couple who took up social reform in several sectors. “Savitribai Phule opened a school for girls and went door to door asking families to send their daughters to school. This was a rare practice as girls were not usually sent to school in the 19th century. Due to her sacrifices and relentless efforts, women are in the forefront of every sector in this country, including science research and defence,” he said.

“She fought vested interests and ensured that women get education in the 1840s. When the Phules were kicked out of their homes, another teacher Fatima Sheikh and her brother Usman Sheikh provided them a building to live and a school for girls. We should acknowledge the contribution of Fatima Sheikh too,” he said.

Caste divisions

If not for the evils of casteism, India would achieved greater heights today. Even our leaders are divided on caste lines. This is all a ploy to see that we should not be united. But we should remain united in the face of challenges. We should resist the challenge of being divided on the lines of caste, language, food habits, region, religion, colour, dress or families deities, he said. We should not be misled by the symbols used to denote culture or religion. The ideologies of Ambedkar and others should help us liberate ourselves from dogma and blind belief, he said.

In a message to his political detractors, he said he would remain a MLA till death. “But I am not attracted by the trappings of power. I want to spend my life in the service of the people. In fact, I would be able to spend more time in social service if I were not in politics,” Mr. Jarkiholi said.

Awards for teachers

He and other dignitaries gave away the Savitribai Phule Best Teacher award to school teachers.

112,2020/01/06,‘Future India’ lecture series in Mysuru,"The Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysuru, has organised a series of lectures by scientists and technologists for students of Mysuru.

The series titled ‘Future India’ aims to educate next-generation technologists and innovators about the achievements of Indian science and technology on various fronts.

The first talk will be on January 10. Information technology analyst and scientist Shivananda Kanavi will speak on ‘How Indians won the Silicon Valley’. Students will get a chance to interact with speakers, the institute said. “We believe that our students get limited chances to listen to experts and hence have launched this initiative,” said CFTRI director KSMS Rao.

The institute has also announced that it is ready to join hands with other academic institutions here to organise such lectures in future. “This would scale up the effort and reach more students,” he added. Entry to the lecture is free but by invite. Those interested can call 0821-2515910 to register.

114,2020/01/06,"Trump, Modi diverting attention from issues, says former Chief Minister","U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are engaged in diverting attention from serious issues bothering their respective administrations, said former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, here on Monday.

At a press conference, Mr. Kumaraswamy said a war-like situation had been created by Mr. Trump. Many across the world were now anticipating the third world war. “Trump is facing impeachment in his country. Moreover, he has to face the election soon. He wants to divert people’s attention from issues bothering the nation for political reasons. Similarly, Narendra Modi has taken up issues like the Citizenship Amendment Act and the NRC to divert people’s attention from the far more serious problem of economic crisis and joblessness,” he said.

There was no need for the CAA at the moment. There had been large scale protests across the country over the issue. Where lakhs took part in protests, there was not even one incident of violence, while in places like Mangaluru where there were hardly a couple of hundred people, the police opened fire. “There is unrest across the country. Students and teaching faculty were assaulted on the JNU campus in New Delhi. I am worried that such incidents may spread to other places very soon,” he stated .

Taking the example of Assam, the State where the NRC exercise had been done, he said that 19 lakh people have been termed illegal migrants as they have failed to prove their citizenship. Even if there were around seven crore with no records to prove their citizenship across the country, the amount required to keep them in detention centres would be more than ₹75,000 crores, he said.

“Those who failed to prove their citizenship have to appear before foreign tribunals. Later, they can go to the High Court and Supreme Court. It would require decades to resolve these cases,” he said.

He added that now investors from foreign countries and those within were worried about investing in India because of the way the NDA government had been performing at the Centre.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/trump-modi-diverting-attention-from-issues-says-former-chief-minister/article30497157.ece
115,2020/01/06,"Focus on flood relief, grim financial position: HDK","Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has urged the State government to pay attention to serious issues of providing relief to the flood-hit and the grim financial position of the State.

Speaking to presspersons here on Monday, said the flood-hit people had not been given suitable relief even months after heavy rains. The Minister in charge of the flood-hit district had not bothered to address these issues. The Centre had not released the grants due to the State. He said that during his tenure, the Centre had allotted ₹900 crore meant for MGNREGA pending. Now, this had increased.

Furthermore, the State’s share in GST had been pending for two-three months. “The senior officers of the Finance Department are worried about preparing the budget for the coming year,”s he said.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had not been able to meet the PM to put the State’s demands forward. “When he and other Ministers went to meet the PM at Raj Bhavan, they were sent back. Even a month after the byelection, the CM has not got his party’s national president’s appointment to expand the Ccabinet. But he has been referred to as Raja-Huli,” he remarked.

Reacting to reports suggesting that he was retiring from politics, Mr. Kumaraswamy said, “I have my own contributions to the State and will remain in politics as long as people want me. I have been responding to serious issues. I was the first to visit Mangaluru, where two people had died in police firing,” he said.

Further, he added that he would not make any attempt to ouster the BJP government. “Often people ask me why I am not taking any steps to disturb the BJP government when 15-20 MLAs of the BJP are ready to quit the ruling party. I don’t want to be involved in such activities,” he said.

The former CM said he was committed to strengthening the party’s organisation. He would hold a series of meetings with party MLAs and other leaders after Sankranti.

Jesus Christ statue

Reacting to a question on the controversy over installing a statue of Jesus near Kanakapura, Mr. Kumaraswamy said he was not aware of the procedures followed while granting the land for the project. “The issue had not come to the Cabinet during my tenure.

116,2020/01/06,"Capturing poignant moments in Malemane, months after the deluge","On Sunday, almost five months after heavy rains hit Malemane in Mudigere taluk, photographers and artists visited the village.

The Poornachandra Tejaswi Photographic Society, which came into existence on Saturday, had taken the group to Malemane as part of its first event to capture the scene at the flood-hit place.

Many families in the village have left their homes and plantations for rented houses in far-off places. Some of them took shelter in attics throughout the night of August 9 last year — the day when the place received a downpour that resulted in landslips.

Wilson D’Souza sketched houses and areca plantations. Ivan D’Silva, A.R. Kiran, Nandish, Shivakumar, Poornesh Mathavara, Prakash Hassan, Rakshit Bangera, Akarsh, and a few others, captured the mood of the people and the place on camera. Harish Kodiyalbailu, an artist from Mangaluru, made an installation showcasing the people’s struggle to survive and rebuild their lives amidst the ruins.

Nemiraj Shetty, a noted artist, looked sad after listening to stories of the people at Malemane. “When it rained heavily, those remained in these houses were only women. They spent the whole night amidst water, while the men were far away. Their phones went off even as they talked to the loved ones. It is a challenge to bring in these feelings in a piece of art or a photograph”, he opined.

As many as six houses and two temples were destroyed in the floods at Malemane. A television set sits idle in one of the ruined structures. “Television brings stories from different parts of the world. But, this one remained silent spectator to the devastation caused by the floods. What would be our response if the set turns into a character to narrate its story of the floods”, wondered Janardana Havanje, also an artist.

M.M. Raju, M.B. Chandre Gowda, M.B. Sathish, M.D. Rajesh, and B. Chandre Gowda are among those who lost their dwelling. Chikkamagaluru district administration has identified land at Angadi village to allot sites for house construction. But, the people are not ready yet as they have not got assurance on the grant of agriculture land.

The photographic society has planned to hold an exhibition of paintings, installations and photographs of the flood-hit places in a few days. “The event is a creative response to the agony of the people affected by the floods.

117,2020/01/06,Zoo to get more zero-emission electric buggies for visitors,"Responding to the tourists’ feedback, the management of the century-old Mysuru zoo will soon be adding a few more battery-operated buggies for touring the expansive campus of the zoological garden.

The zero-emission buggies are much sought after, especially among elderly citizens, visitors with children and persons with disabilities. The vehicles are taken close to the animal and bird enclosures by the zoo staff.

Usually, it takes about two hours to tour the zoo by foot, seeing all enclosures that house over 125 species of animals and birds. The zoo is one of the country’s largest with a collection of over 1,200 animals and birds.

It currently has 11 buggies with a seating capacity for 10 to 15 persons. Some are big and accommodate more visitors. The buggy ride costs ₹150 per person.

The waiting time for the buggies has been getting longer with the vehicles running continually and almost full in each ride from morning till evening. The visitors had urged the zoo management to increase the number of ‘green’ buggies for their convenience.

Zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni said more buggies are in the offing. “We have received feedback from our visitors and accordingly we have decided to expand the fleet. A Government of India undertaking has come forward to donate three buggies. The zoo will also be procuring a few more.”

He, however, said that the zoo cannot put in place buggies beyond a certain limit since the number of people going around the zoo by foot is very high. “We need to strike a balance and go by what the situation warrants.” The zoo, which also manages the Karanji Lake Nature Park, had been urged to introduce buggies even in the nature park since its campus is also huge.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8n45vn/article30497003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0MYSBUGGY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/zoo-to-get-more-zero-emission-electric-buggies-for-visitors/article30497004.ece

According to P.C. Ray, Commissioner of the Watershed Development, under Sujala III, an LRI Atlas was created for 14 lakh hectares, covering 44 taluks in 12 districts. The project, which was partially funded by the Centre, will come to an end in March 2020.

There still remains 52 lakh hectares of rain-fed watershed areas that need to be treated scientifically in the State. The government has now decided to sanction ₹500 crore over the next five years to cover 100 watersheds in as many taluks. “The project is likely to be officially launched on January 10 and work will start soon,” he said.

Mr. Ray also said that the project would be taken up in convergence with the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Yojana and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. “We will take it up with the help of non-governmental organisations. The tender process has been completed and we are evaluating them,” he said. Once finalised, the NGOs will take up awareness drives, community mobilisation and other activities by February, he added.

According to Rajendra Hegde, head of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, the lead knowledge partner on the Sujala project, the LRI Atlas has helped provide farmers with parcel-wise specific advisory for watershed planning, soil and moisture conservation, and crop management for increasing productivity in rain-fed agriculture and horticulture. Of the over 2,500 watersheds already covered, treatment plans for 90 were developed on a pilot basis in 2016-17. “These will require at least two or three years to yield results,” he said.

Considering the fact that such a scientific inventory was the first of its kind in the country, the World Bank is keen on funding similar projects in other States. Already, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh had evinced interest. The project has also been hailed in one of the World Bank’s conclaves. “The World Bank felt this was the best solution for climate-smart agriculture. Representatives from many African nations, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Mozambique, and Tanzania, visited Bengaluru last month to learn about the Sujala project,” Mr. Hegde said.

Assisting farmers

The Watershed Development Department has created an LRI Atlas covering 14 lakh hectares in 44 taluks of 12 districts. This helps farmers chose crops suitable for cultivation after taking into account the site and soil characteristics.

To disseminate this information to all stakeholders, the department has developed a digital library and Decision Support System (DSS), including a mobile application. Currently, the department’s website is being redesigned, said P.C. Ray, Commissioner of Watershed Development. He said the DSS and app were yet to stabilise and would be available to the public in two weeks.

Under Sujala III, Land Resource Inventory Card was generated for every survey number generated. So far, over 3.35 lakh LRI cards have been distributed. LRI cards, he said, were an improvement on soil health cards.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i08r9j/article30496783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGSUJALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/100-more-watersheds-in-drought-prone-areas-to-be-mapped/article30496784.ece
121,2020/01/06,Khelo India sports complex to come up in Hubballi,"A full-fledged Khelo India sports complex estimated at ₹ 100 crore will be set up under the Smart City project to promote sports activities here, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi has said.

Mr. Joshi was speaking after inaugurating a swimming pool and smart health and smart school projects taken up under the Smart City project here on Sunday. He also launched other projects, including market yards at Bengeri and Unkal, a multi-parking complex, a smart road and a children’s train.

Mr. Joshi said that it was decided to set up the sports complex as part of the efforts to accomplish Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitious Fit India campaign. It is one of his ambitions to see India fit and healthy for, the progress of the nation heavily depends on the health conditions of the people. Healthy people only could contribute to the progress as well as prosperity of the nation. Therefore, more focus would be given to providing health facilities. The Smart Health project has been launched at the Chitaguppi Hospital here. Henceforth, it would be possible to do diagnosis and health check-up in a speedy manner and generate computerised health reports through artificial intelligence, he added.

Mr. Joshi said that, henceforth, these facilities have to be maintained by the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) and asked the HDMC officials to see that these facilities are maintained properly and also ensure that the city remains dust free.

A plan to utilise Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds to develop the sports facilities is being worked out. Accordingly, the swimming pool, which is being constructed at a cost of ₹ 15 crore near the Deputy Commissioner’s office compound in Dharwad would be upgraded to a sports complex. The public sector Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is ready to provide ₹ 15 crore additional grants required for this project. This apart, it has been decided to construct stadiums in all taluks utilising CSR funds. The government is committed to supporting sports activities and it has set a target of nurturing more number of sportspersons to win more number of laurels at international sports competitions, he said. Medium and Large Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, who presided over the function, said that several development works which were halted half way have been resumed. The formal inauguration of the BRTS project would be done shortly. As a prelude to the Investors Meet scheduled on February 14, road shows would be held in Mumbai and Hyderabad on January 29, he said.

Smart City managing director C.W. Shakeel Ahmed said that of the 55 works finalised under the Smart City project, nine have been completed. On the cost of the newly inaugurated projects, he said that ₹ 3.3 crore has been spent for the swimming pool, ₹ 3.6 crore for Smart Health and ₹ 1.17 crore has been spent for the Smart School. Similarly, work on developing market yards at Bengeri (₹ 6.08 crore), Unkal (₹ 2.09 crore) and the multi-parking facility (₹ 4.59 crore) would be completed shortly, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dr5oim/article30496687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07HBDHARWADKHELOINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/khelo-india-sports-complex-to-come-up-in-hubballi/article30496688.ece
122,2020/01/06,ASHAs warned of wage cut if they don’t report to work,"With Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) from across the State on an indefinite strike since January 3, the State Health Department has warned that if they do not get back to work and submit a report within 5 p.m. daily, their monthly honorarium and incentives will be deducted.

Demanding a fixed monthly honorarium of ₹12,000 and pending payment of Mother and Child Tracking System incentive, nearly 20,000 ASHAs from across the State had launched an indefinite strike in Bengaluru on Friday. From Saturday, they have boycotted services in their villages.

While D. Nagalakshmi, secretary of Karnataka State Samyukta ASHA Karyakarteyara Sangha, claimed that the strike had continued successfully in all districts, State health officials said that nearly 90% of the workers had returned to work. There are 41,268 ASHAs in the State.

Maintaining that most demands have been met, Prabhu Dev Gowda, State Nodal Officer for ASHA programme, said: “Most of the workers are convinced. But, there are some districts where the sangha office-bearers are pressurising ASHAs to stay away from work. We have issued a circular warning the ASHAs that if they do not submit a report within 5 p.m. daily to their jurisdictional junior health assistant, their honorarium and incentives will be deducted,” he said. Disputing that most ASHAs had got back to work, Ms Nagalakshmi said: “We are firm this time and will continue our strike till our demands are met completely. When our payments are pending for the last 15 months for work we have done, why will we ask for payment on days that we have not worked?”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ashas-warned-of-wage-cut-if-they-dont-report-to-work/article30496678.ece
123,2020/01/06,Farmer shows Neralaghatta village the green way using areca husk,"A village in Doddaballapur taluk near Bengaluru can perhaps be a role model for North India, which suffers from smog during the winter season due to burning of farm waste.

Neralaghatta village and its surroundings that have areca plantations used to burn areca husk during the winter as farmers considered it a waste. But, thanks to innovative farmer Lakshminarayana Gowda, who showed that the husk can be turned into a nutrient rich compost, the village stopped the practice of burning areca husk one-and-half decades ago.

“I noticed that plants near a dump of areca husk had grown well. This made me experiment with decomposting the husk. I added various elements to enrich it. In the course of time, the local Krishi Vigyana Kendra at Hadonahalli advised me to add certain bio-fertilisers during decomposition of areca husk so that the method is scientific,” says Mr. Gowda.

“My experiment showed that the compost has helped increase my areca nut yield by nearly 30%. Another advantage is that I have now completely stopped using chemical fertilisers, which would have cost over ₹1.5 lakh a year,” Mr. Gowda told The Hindu. Soon, the idea caught up with fellow villagers.

Areca husk compost is not completely new as scientists have now developed a scientific way of doing this. But Mr. Gowda shot to fame as he did it in 2001-02 and contributed to environmental protection by popularising it among fellow villagers.

Recognising his innovation, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) included him among the 300 innovative farmers who had been invited from across the country to take part in the Farm Science Congress that was organised as part of the Indian Science Congress in Bengaluru on Monday.

Mr. Gowda said he was satisfied that all the villagers had adopted his practice. Referring to the reports that several north Indian cities suffer from the problem of smog due to burning of agricultural waste, he wondered why a similar method should not be tried there.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/h595ou/article30496674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGLAKSHMINARAYANAGOWDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmer-shows-neralaghatta-village-the-green-way-using-areca-husk/article30496675.ece

125,2020/01/06,Mobile app launched for 7th Economic Census,"The mobile application for the 7th Economic Census was launched here on Monday. Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar, who launched the app at his office here, said the data for the census will be collected through the app and such an initiative was being carried out for the first time.

The census, which got off to a start on January 1, was expected to be completed by March this year. With the use of app, the authorities hope to speed up data collection and evaluation.

All households and establishments engaged in non-agricultural economic activities will be documented. One of the aims of the census was the preparation of National Business Register that will be in turn linked with existing databases at the Central and State government levels, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation which is conducting the census.

The economic activities and ownership patterns of businesses in the city, towns and villages will be evaluated. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has partnered with CSC e-Governance services India Ltd. for conducting the census.

The economic census was conducted once in five years.

The previous census in 2014 was conducted through the staff of government and aided institutions.

In the census conducted in 2014, 1,40,232 businesses, 88,062 in rural areas and 52,170 in urban areas, had been documented in Mysuru district, said Mr. Sankar.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/v94j1z/article30496563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MYSCENSUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mobile-app-launched-for-7th-economic-census/article30496564.ece
126,2020/01/06,"Years on, two projects in Tumakuru flagged off by PM limp along","There was much hope when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the India Foodpark, spread across 114 acres within the Vasantha Narasapur Industrial Area, near Tumakuru, on September 24, 2014. It was believed that it would not only help farmers add to their income, but also generate as many as 10,000 jobs by 2018 here.

There were similar hopes when Mr. Modi laid the foundation stone for a helicopter manufacturing unit of Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) at Bidarehalla Kaval in Gubbi taluk on January 3, 2016. He had said that more than 4,000 families would get jobs directly or indirectly from it, and that the first helicopter manufactured at this unit would fly by 2018.

These promises, however, are yet to be met, even as the Prime Minister made one more visit to the city recently. In fact, farmers who gave up their land for both these projects say they are in distress because even as they have lost their traditional livelihood, nothing new has been realised.

In a dismal state

According to the Factories and Boilers Department, the number of units with more than 10 workers in Vasantha Narasapur Industrial Area is 67; the total number of employees is about 4,500.

A visit to the food park reveals that there are 14 units making products such as chips, rice flour, chutney powder, ketchup, wafers, and bakery items. As many as 1,050 people work there.

A member of the Vasantha Narasapur Industries’ Association said that agricultural produce is not necessarily being procured from farmers and processed and marketed as assured by Mr. Modi.

Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sanga district president A. Govindaraju said that while farmers have lost their lands, the promise of big job generation for their children is yet to be met. “Also, nothing is purchased from the local farmers,” he said.

Siddappa, a farmer from Kanchenahalli, told The Hindu that his 3.5 acres of land, on which he was growing 30 quintals of ragi a year, was acquired for the industrial area, but it remains vacant even now. “Nothing has been built on it. And I cannot cultivate it either.” He said he was paid ₹16 lakh an acre. “I thought my son, who has studied engineering, would land a job in the industrial area, but that too has not happened,” he said.

This seems to have made other farmers weary. A couple, Nagaraj and Shivamma, who own five acres and eight guntas of land near NH4, are not willing to take ₹50 lakh an acre and move out.

Delayed takeoff

As far as the helicopter wing goes, HAL has built a compound around the 610 acres of land acquired for it and a few administrative buildings have come up. However, the copter manufacturing unit is yet to be functional.

Mr. Govindaraju said that for the project, the authorities had evicted more than 60 bagair hukum farmers’ families who were cultivating on the government land for several years. As they were unauthorised cultivators, they have not got compensation.

M.M. Umesh, a farmer from Marashettihalli, said he had been cultivating on four acres of land for the past 30 years, but compensation was given only to people with documents. “Now, I work as an agricultural labourer and earn ₹400 a day. With this meagre amount, it is very difficult to educate my two sons,” he said.

The issue is now in a legal wrangle, with all the bagair hukum farmers approaching the High Court.

Deputy Commissioner K. Rakesh Kumar said that all those who had “saguvali chits”, or certificates of grant to beneficiary, have got alternative land and compensation. “If they do not have proper documents for the land they were cultivating, compensation cannot be given,” he said. He added that skilled positions can be given only to those who have the required qualification for it, whereas unskilled positions can be given to anyone. He insisted that local people had got jobs in the industrial area.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gygabv/article30496094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGTUMAKURUFOODPARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/years-on-two-projects-in-tumakuru-flagged-off-by-pm-limp-along/article30496095.ece
127,2020/01/06,Salaries of 20% National Health Mission contract staff slashed,"At least 20% of the nearly 23,000 outsourced and contractual National Health Mission (NHM) staff in the State will see a reduction, in some cases drastic, in their pay scale two years after it was hiked. This is apparently because the Government of India has found late in the day that the hike was “not scientifically done”.

As most contract and outsourced staff with similar profiles under different programmes of NHM get different salaries, the State Health Department had rationalised the salaries in 2017 to bring parity among them.

For example, a nurse outsourced under Reproductive Child Health (RCH) unit was paid lesser than a nurse in the Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU). Similarly, a social worker with a degree in social work was drawing a lesser salary than a colleague with a degree in psychology. Apart from this, the staff also got the mandatory 5% annual increment.

Now, following directions from the Centre, the State officials have restructured the salaries. This is what has resulted in reduction in salaries in about 20% of the staff.

Confirming this development, NHM Mission Director Ramachandran R. told The Hindu that the previous rationalisation was not proper. “This was pointed out by the Government of India during the Supplementary Action Plan approval in September. Following this, the Centre also issued revised guidelines for cadre-wise salary structure. I learnt about this in mid-December when I took over as Mission Director. This discrepancy had to be set right and the December salaries will be paid as per the new guidelines,” he said. A State team is now in New Delhi getting the annual action plan approved and there could be further adjustments.

Mr. Ramachandran admitted that following the fresh restructuring, around 20% of contractual and outsourced staff would get lesser salaries. Of the rest, while some may get a hike, others may draw the same salary. “We have already intimated the staff about the revised salaries,” he said. He said if the fresh restructuring has drastically affected anyone, he was open to hearing their grievances.

Meanwhile, many staff members are shocked and livid over the fact that they will get even lesser than the meagre salary they are currently drawing.

A social worker in the mental health unit, who was drawing ₹27,563 after the rationalisation in 2017, will get ₹16,044 after the restructuring. A ward assistant, who drew ₹11,025, will now get ₹5,700. Similarly, a record keeper, will get ₹8,684 against the previous pay of ₹12,800.

“The current pay of contract employees is meagre and half of what permanent employees draw. When we have been demanding pay parity with permanent staff, this new development comes as a shocker,” said Vasu H.V., president of Karnataka State Government Contract Employees’ Federation.

What is NHM?

The National Health Mission was launched in 2013 after the National Rural Health Mission, launched in 2005, was brought under it. NHM had an added component of National Urban Health Mission. NHM administers and funds more than 10 programmes—National Vector Borne Disease Control programme (NVBDCP), Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP), Reproductive Child Health, National Programme for Control of Blindness, National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control Programme, National Leprosy Eradication Programme, Integrated Disease Surveillance Project, National Mental Health Programme, Non-communicable Disease Control Programme, Programme for Prevention and Management of Burn Injuries and National Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn Child and Adolescent Health. Doctors, pharmacists, nursing staff, data entry operators, ward assistants, record keepers and social workers among other are part of the 23,000 contract and outsourced staff.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/salaries-of-20-national-health-mission-contract-staff-slashed/article30495997.ece

129,2020/01/06,ICAR to set up Farmers’ Innovation Fund,"A system will soon be put in place to scientifically validate, scale up and propagate the innovations of progressive farmers as the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) is poised to set up a Farmers’ Innovation Fund.

“We are confident that the fund will become operational by the next financial year,” ICAR Director-General Trilochan Mohapatra told mediapersons at the Farmers Science Congress in Bengaluru on Monday.

As part of this system, an innovation centre will be established in New Delhi where the innovations will be scientifically validated, he explained. Farmers will also be allowed to pursue research under the system, he noted.

Pointing out that innovations of farmers are being documented by the Krishi Vigyan Kendras, he said the additional system would encourage farmers to continue their innovations. The main intention was to link farmers and farming with science and to ensure that their farm practices are science-based, Dr. Mohapatra said.

Emphasising that agriculture is a pure science, he said: “If you do not apply the principles of science to agriculture, then we will fail.” Various revolutions in agricultural and allied sectors, including green revolution and white revolutions, happened because of scientific approach and use of technology, he said.

As part of efforts to encourage use of technology in farm sector, a linkage had been created between 105 start ups with farmers. The ICAR had also developed 45 different organic farming models suitable for different agro-climatic regions and had validated 51 integrated farming systems to help increase farm income, he said.

Expressing happiness over creating a new precedence of introducing farmers congress in the Indian National Congress’ summits, Dr. Mohapatra said the practice would help farmers not only learn from one another, but also interact with scientists from across the country.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/icar-to-set-up-farmers-innovation-fund/article30495824.ece

131,2020/01/06,Centre approves additional flood relief of ₹669.85 crore for Karnataka,"Less than four days after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa made a plea to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release additional funds for undertaking relief works in the State’s flood-hit districts, the Centre on Monday approved the release of ₹669.85 crore to the State.

The Centre had earlier announced a first instalment of ₹1,200 crore. With the second instalment, the total aid released by the Centre to Karnataka comes up to ₹1,869.85 crore, sources in the Chief Minister’s Office told The Hindu.

As many as 103 taluks were hit by last year’s floods, which left crops and properties worth more than ₹1 lakh crore damaged.

The Home Ministry, in a statement, said the decision to release a second instalment of funds was taken at a high-level committee meeting chaired by Home Minister Amit Shah. The Opposition had been criticising Mr. Modi for neglecting the State by not releasing funds for undertaking relief works in flood-hit districts.

The Stamps and Registration Department has contributed ₹8,297.65 crore, against the target of ₹11,828 crore (70.15%), while the Transport Department has collected ₹4,864.8 crore, against a target of ₹7,100 crore (68.51%).

The revenue decline in the Transport Department is largely owing to slowdown in sales of motor vehicles. The State is expected to see a shortfall of ₹300 crore in the current year, Mr. Yediyurappa said.

The royalty earned from mining stands at ₹2,527.61 crore, against the target of ₹3,550 crore, (71%).

134,2020/01/06,Subway to link Mysuru zoo with parking lot to ease rush on road,"PIC SENT

* The proposed underpass will be constructed under the busy Shalivahana Road, a key link road, which will be closed soon in front of the zoo until the completion of work

* Traffic Police have notified alternative routes after the closure of vehicle movement

* The zoo management hopes to get the subway done in two to three months

Shankar Bennur

:

The traffic congestion witnessed almost everyday on the road in front of the Mysuru zoo is expected to be eased soon with the zoo management all set to launch the construction of a subway linking the zoo and its parking lot. The subway will pass through the busy Shalivahana Road.

Hundreds of tourist vehicles are parked at the parking lot located in front of the zoo and the tourists rush to the zoo crossing the busy Shalivahana road, causing congestion. Traffic constables have a tough time managing the vehicles and the crowds especially during weekends and public holidays.

As a permanent remedy to the problem, the zoo management will soon be launching the work to construct the subway or an underpass connecting the zoo’s main entrance and the parking lot.

Shalivahana Road is one of the major roads connecting Mysore Race Club, Siddhartha Layout, Ittigegud, Lalitha Mahal Road, T.Narsipur Road, Alanahalli, Chamundi Hills and localities on the foothills.

The subway project is expected to cost ₹1.9 crore and the scheduled completion of the work is six months. The road will be closed once the work starts and the traffic police have already notified alternative routes for vehicle movement.

“We have told the contractor to complete the work at least in three months’ time since the road is one of the busiest and cannot be kept closed for a long time. Moreover, it will be convenient for the visitors if the work is done at the earliest,” said Ajit Kulkarni, Executive Director, Mysuru Zoo.

He told The Hindu that the subway had become inevitable in terms of visitors’ safety and also for smooth traffic management. The road used to get jammed especially during Dasara and holidays.

On many days the parking lot becomes inadequate and the tourist vehicles are directed to park on the vacant land in Doddakere Maidan, behind the Exhibition Grounds.

The subway work had been planned from January 2 but has been put off for a couple of days since the zoo had been witnessing a rush of tourists.

Visitors coming with children and elderly citizens find it difficult to cross the busy road.

The zoo management has plans to introduce battery-operated buggies between the parking lot and the zoo to ferry the visitors once the subway was completed. The buggy ride would be optional and ride costs may be included in the tickets.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/subway-to-link-mysuru-zoo-with-parking-lot-to-ease-rush-on-road/article30495080.ece
135,2020/01/06,Mysuru Cong. to complain to cyber crime police against misleading online campaign for CAA,"The Congress will be lodging a complaint with the cyber crime police here against the misleading dial-in campaign for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

After the BJP’s national leadership invited missed calls to a toll-free number from the general public to gain support for the issue, the saffron party’s IT cell allegedly began a misleading campaign to lure people, claimed Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) spokesperson M. Lakshmana.

At a press conference here on Monday, he alleged that the BJP’s IT cell had created about 3,000 such misleading tweets with offers ranging from chats with “lonely women” to free Netflix subscription to a chat with Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt to the people calling the toll-free number.

Though a complaint has been lodged by All India Congress Committee (AICC) at the national level, Mr. Lakshmana said the party’s Mysuru unit will also lodge a complaint.

He also described as a “bundle of lies” a pamphlet distributed by the BJP leaders as part of the campaign in favour of CAA. “They have conveniently ignored the chaos CAA will cause in the society when implemented along with National Register of Citizens (NRC)”, he said before adding that the Congress will also soon launch a campaign to create awareness among the people about the actual impact of the legislations on the society.

Varuna Assembly constituency MLA Yathindra Siddaramaiah cited the difficulties faced by people in Assam, who had been left out of the NRC list, as an example of the threat posed to people in the rest of the country. “Both Muslims and Hindus had been left out of the NRC list in Assam recently”, he said. Also, CAA provides citizenship only to minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. “Why has the government left out the migrants from Sri Lanka?’, Mr Yathindra asked.

The laws will put into jeopardy the lives of not only Muslims, but also a large number of poor, Dalits and tribals in the country, he added.

KPCC spokesperson Manjula Manasa, who was present on the occasion, accused the BJP leaders and supporters of painting as “anti-nationals” the people who question the government’s actions. She also accused the BJP of sowing the seeds of communal poison in the minds of the people through people like Ballari MLA Somashekar Reddy while strongly condemning his utterances in Ballari recently.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dglb9w/article30495299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MYSCONG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-cong-to-complain-to-cyber-crime-police-against-misleading-online-campaign-for-caa/article30494829.ece

137,2020/01/06,Students protest in Mysuru against JNU violence,"Students gathered at Ramaswamy Circle in Mysuru on Monday to protest against the violence unleashed at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in New Delhi on Sunday evening.

The students, who had come together under the aegis of All India Democratic Students’ Organization (AIDSO), held aloft placards expressing their “solidarity with the victims of atrocities in JNU” and shouting slogans against the ‘goondaism’ and ‘hooliganism’ on the campus.

A statement issued on behalf of AIDSO’s Mysuru district unit said the “masked goondas belonging to Akhila Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishat (ABVP), who were wielding iron rods and lathis” had unleashed terror by attacking students and teachers.

The attackers targeted the students, who were protesting against the hike in fees by JNU, AIDSO claimed while describing as ‘shameful’ the alleged cooperation shown by the Delhi police to the goondaism on the campus.

AIDSO also accused the JNU administration of supporting the violence by allowing the masked goondas to enter the campus and attack the students.

138,2020/01/06,"Women’s groups protest against CAA, NRC","Various women organisations held a protest gathering at Darbar High School ground here on Monday against CAA and NRC. It was first all-women protest organised by women where leaders of different faiths raised their voice against CAA and NRC.

Since the district police had not allowed any rally and permitted only a gathering, hundreds of women joined at the ground at around 11 a.m. Nineteen-year-old student activist of Bengaluru, Amulya Leona, grabbed attention with her speech, making the crowd respond with slogans and applauses.

Describing CAA and NRC as “draconian policies” being framed by the BJP government to divide the county on religious lines, she wondered why the government was implementing the Act when people were facing bigger problems. “People have been asking for jobs, medical facilities and basic amenities. Instead of focussing on these issues, the BJP is implementing rules that are no good for the country. On the contrary, they are aimed at creating division among the citizens based on religion”, Ms. Leona alleged.

Taking exception to the statement of Union Home Minister Amit Shah who had said that there is no question of going back on NRC, Ms. Leona said “countless people of the country have decided not go back from their decision of opposing the NRC.”

Accusing the BJP of trying to replace the Constitution with Manusmriti, she said that activists will never allow the basics of the Constitution to be ‘twisted’.

She said that she will never show any documents to prove her citizenship, and took a promise from the audience never to disclose their documents to prove their citizenship. “We were born here and will die here. This is our land, we will never ever prove out citizenship to you. We will never show any documents to you”, she said.

He was the 14th Governor of Karnataka. He was appointed as Governor in 2002 by the NDA government headed by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

In a condolence message, Mr. Yediyurappa said Mr. Chaturvedi sincerely rendered his duties as the Governor of the State.

The State saw the Congress government headed by S.M. Krishna, coalition governments headed by N. Dharam Singh and H.D. Kumaraswamy when Mr. Chaturvedi was the Governor.

A civil servant by profession, Mr. Chaturvedi was member of the Rajya Sabha in the early 1990s and was member of several committees of the Parliament.

Being the chancellor of universities, he was a regular at convocation functions of universities across the State.

140,2020/01/06,College students stage protest in Shivamogga,"Condemning the assault on students by masked men on the campus of Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), students from various colleges in Shivamogga city staged a protest on the premises of Deputy Commissioner’s office under the aegis of National Students Union of India (NSUI) on Monday.

Addressing the protest meet, Chethan K., vice-president of NSUI State unit, alleged that JNU students have been targeted for the protests they had staged against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens(NRC) recently.

He said there was a glaring failure by the Delhi police controlled by Ministry of Home Affairs to collect intelligence inputs on the incident and to provide security for the students. Referring to the incidents of police beating up students on the campus of Jamia Milia Islamia University and the crackdown at Aligarh Muslim University during the protests against CAA, he said students who are against the CAA are being targeted in a systematic manner.

The intolerance displayed against the students for expressing their political views is against the democratic ethos of the land, he said.

The protesters raised slogans demanding a thorough probe into the JNU incident and arrest of the assailants at the earliest. They requested the President to take note of the atrocities being committed against students who have taken stand against CAA.

They submitted a memorandum to the President in this regard through the office of Deputy Commissioner. Functionaries of NSUI Balaji, Vinay, Vijay and Ravi took part in the protest.

Mr. Kumaraswamy said Donald Trump has created a war-like situation. “He is facing impeachment in his country. As he has to face an election soon, Mr. Trump is trying to divert attention from core issues. Now, there is a talk of the third world war,” he said.

Similarly in India, Kumaraswamy said, “Mr. Modi has been raking the non-issues like CAA and NRC to divert the people’s attention from economic crisis and unemployment problem.”

The incidents happening across the country over CAA and NRC have created a sense of worry, he added. “Students were attacked at JNU campus yesterday. I am worried that such incidents may spread across the country in the coming days.

142,2020/01/06,"After criticism, BSY says there is no proposal to rename Ramanagaram as ‘Nava Bengaluru’","Amidst criticism by the Janata Dal (S) and Congress leaders over a proposal to rename Ramanagaram district as New (Nava) Bengaluru, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa late on Sunday night clarified that there was no proposal to rename the district.

In a clarification, Mr. Yediyurappa said: “An unnecessary discussion on renaming Ramanagaram is under way. There is no thought before the government over renaming.” He accused the Congress and JD(S) leaders of indulging in baseless discussion to mislead the people and to remain relevant. “There is no such agenda before the government. It is a joke that JD(S) and Congress leaders are starting a fight over it.”

The Chief Minister’s clarification came after criticism by former Chief Minister H. D. Kumaraswamy, who carved out the Ramanagaram district when he was Chief Minister, and former Minister D.K. Shivakumar whose Kanakapura constituency is in Ramanagaram district, after Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said Ramanagaram could be renamed as Nava Bengaluru to increase investments prospects.

On Sunday, Mr. Kumaraswamy took to Twitter and in a series of tweets with hashtag #SaveRamanagar, he criticised the government’s intention to rename Ramanagaram. Threatening to launch a fight if the government did not rescind its decision, he said that the decision to rename was also partly due to political hatred towards him. He asked Mr. Yediyurappa if he wanted to develop Ramanagaram, he could instead release the funds earmarked for the district in the budget.

Giving a historical perspective, he said Ramanagaram taluk, which was earlier called Closepet was renamed by former Chief Mnister late Kengal Hanumanthaiya. “I extended it to the whole district.” Further, he said: “Every rich man in Bengaluru dreams of having land within a 100-km radius. In this North Indians are big in number. That is why our land has fallen prey to farm houses. The renaming of Ramanagaram helps these people and not farmers.”

In another tweet, he challenged the Chief Minister to rename other districts also as Bengaluru to attract investments. “What is there in a name? By just calling Bengaluru is development possible? Can BSY who comes forward to change the name of Ramanagar, change the name of Shivamogga to Bengaluru?”

Meanwhile, Mr. Shivakumar said that he had earlier suggested that it be renamed Bengaluru South. “It is up to the government.

Even BJP MPs failed to properly represent the people and their difficulties to the Centre, he said. Though the State Government had claimed that the loss was worth several crores, the Centre did not come to the aid of the people, he regretted. He threatened to call for a Karnataka bandh when Mr. Modi visited next without releasing funds for flood relief.

Mr. Nagaraj also regretted that the Centre had failed to announced Bharat Ratna for late Siddaganga Mutt seer Shivakumar Swami. Neither CM B.S.

144,2020/01/06,Ploggathon for clean Mysuru evokes good response,"It was a race with a difference with the winners decided by the quantity of plastic waste collected by the participants.

Conducted by the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) on Sunday as part of its Swachh Survekshan 2020 drive, the runners rushed in to swoop up plastic trash on roads and sidewalks, collected it in sacks and moved along to complete the course.

The ‘Mysuru Maha Ploggathon’ was flagged of by former cricketer Javagal Srinath and humorist Krishne Gowda. It as the first such endeavour in the city that evoked a good response with hundreds of participants.

The concept originated in Sweden with people picking up plastic waste while they jogged and is now a trend across the world and part of the environmental movement.

Participants had to opt for one of the three routes – each 3 km long. The race was flagged off from Kote Anjaneyaswamy temple. One group headed towards J.C. Circle and Gun House while the second headed towards K.R. Circle and the D. Devaraj Urs Road. The third raced to Silver Jubilee Clock Tower and Ashoka Road and all of them converged at Town Hall at the end .

Every participant was given a cloth bag to collect trash. MCC authorities weighed the waste and Mayur, a resident of Agrahara, was declared the winter as he had picked up 2.3 kg of garbage. MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj said that in all, nearly two tonnes of plastic waste was collected.

145,2020/01/06,"20 months since inauguration, new DC office yet to be occupied","Even though twenty months had passed since it was inaugurated, the new Deputy Commissioner’s office in Siddharthanagar remains unoccupied.

The office on Mysuru-Bannur Double Road in Siddharthanagar, resembling the heritage Lalitha Mahal Palace in its architecture, was inaugurated on March 10, 2018, by former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah weeks before the last elections to the Assembly. However, the DC office continues to be housed in the more than 120 year old colonial-era style building, which leads to the Central Business District of D. Devaraj Urs Road.

The State government had decided to house all the offices of the district administration under one roof and laid the foundation stone of the new office in August 2016. The construction of the building on a 15 acre plot, earlier housing the German Press, with a total built up area of 23,000 sq.m. including a basement, ground, first and second floors was expedited and completed in 19 months at a cost of around ₹85 crore in March last year.

The delay in the shifting of the offices from the existing building to the newly-built one was taken up by Housing Minister V. Somanna, who is also the Minister in-charge of Mysuru district, with the officials of the district administration on Saturday evening.

Spelling out the reasons for the delay, Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar said the cabling work pertaining to State Wide Area Network (SWAN) is holding up the process. The contract for laying the cables is part of the entire project including the construction of the building and the delay in clearing the pending bills to the contractor is among the reasons for the incomplete cabling work.

All the systems in the Deputy Commissioner’s office are linked to the SWAN of the government, which is a closed user group that is encrypted and fully secure. The authorities cannot use the Internet cables of private service providers in view of the possibility of breach of data and leakage of confidential information. Even if the departments shift to the new building, the officials will not be able log in to their computers for routine work.

The Public Works Department (PWD) under whom the works fall also informed Mr. Somanna about the pending dues to the contractor.

Mr. Somanna, who assured to do the needful, directed the officials to expedite the pending works needed for the shifting to the new building.

Apart from the Revenue Department, which falls directly under the Deputy Commissioner, the new building is expected to house the offices of District Registrar, Treasury, Muzrai, Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare, Mines and Geology, Legal Metrology, Fisheries, Excise Departments and B.R. Ambedkar Development Corporation.

The new office will also have parking spaces for four-wheelers and two-wheelerss, toilets and two capsule-type glass lifts. It remains to be seen if the shifting is expedited after the meeting Mr. Somanna held with officials and people’s representatives.

The meeting, among others, was also attended by Chamaraja MLA L. Nagendra, Police Commissioner K.T. Balakrishna, Superintendent of Mysuru district police C.B. Rishyant, Mysuru ZPCEO K.

146,2020/01/06,"Citizens’ feedback crucial for cleanest city tag, says MCC","The city’s quest for cleanest city tag under Swachh Survekshan 2020 rests on public feedback to a large extent as 25% (1,500) of 6,000 marks are earmarked for it. The remaining 4,500 are earmarked for Direct Observation (1,500) Service Level Progress (1,500), Garbage-Free City (1,000) and Open Defecation Free (500).

The MCC will go on overdrive to elicit positive feedback from the public and encourage them to participate in the SS2020 by downloading the Swachhta App or by calling 1969 and answering 7 questions. Apart from educational institutions, the MCC will also hold an extensive interaction with professional bodies like associations of hotel owners, lawyers, doctors, NGOs, etc.

MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj pointed out that Mysuru was relegated to third place behind Indore in Madhya Pradesh and Ambikapur in Chattisgarh. The difference between Mysuru and Ambikapur was hardly 30 marks and this was attributed to the poor response from the public to the survey in 2019.

Of a total of 1,250, Mysuru secured 972 and the yawning margin of 278 affected its overall ranking.On Service Level Progress, the city scored 1,195 of 1,250 — the highest among the ULBs. It secured 200 of 250 for ODF certification and 800 of 1,000 under garbage free rating. The marks for service level progress and garbage free city and ODF are based on the physical progress achieved and calls for creating infrastructure to collect, dispose and recycle waste. This is not something that can be done overnight but has taken years of consistent effort. The net impact of the service level progress will be on Direct Observation wherein third party auditors will come in for site-specific inspection and upload photographs from the spot to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs server and provide feedback.

“Details of availability of toilets with geographical locations and the city map with slums, etc., are already with the inspecting team as these details are to be uploaded by ULBs to the MoHUA to provide a real-time update on the cleanliness of the city,” according to Dr.Nagaraj.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/citizens-feedback-crucial-for-cleanest-city-tag-says-mcc/article30488784.ece
147,2020/01/06,"LDF, UDF condemn JNU violence in one voice","The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition have condemned the attack on students and teachers of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Sunday in almost identical terms.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan castigated the violence unleashed by unknown persons wearing masks and wielding hockey and polo sticks as ‘Nazi-style attacks.’ He pointedly tweeted the images of injured JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh and Professor Suchitra Sen on his official account.

“The attackers intend to create an atmosphere of unrest and terror in the country. The scale of the attack reveals the extent of planning that went into it. The Sangh Parivar must end this diabolical plan to silence universities with bloodshed. Remember, those students are speaking for all,” Mr. Vijayan tweeted.

Speaking at the Chief Minister’s Student Leaders’ Conclave in Kozhikode, Mr. Vijayan said, “What happened at the JNU and the turbulent situation in the country are a matter of concern for the youth of the country.”

‘Take to the street’

At the same function, Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel exhorted campuses in the State to protest against the incident and urged students to take to the street. “Such an attack on campuses had not taken place even during the height of the freedom struggle. The police had not entered campuses even then,” he said.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the onslaught was yet another galling example of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-sponsored fascism in action.

Some reports suggested that the attack was in retaliation to the protests Union Home Minister Amit Shah faced in a neighbourhood in New Delhi.

The country should rise as one in defiance against the attempts of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to choke democratic protests.

CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan condemned the ‘saffron terror’ that threatened democracy and the rule of law in the country.

The anti-Centre protests by students following the attack resonated across campuses in Kerala. Activists of the Students Federation of India (SFI) protested against the Modi government in front of the Accountant General’s office here.

Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V. Muraleedharan struck a different tone.

148,2020/01/06,Cong. playing hide-and-seek on CAA: CM,"Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has accused the Congress party of playing hide-and-seek with the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Inaugurating the culmination of a youth march organised by the Democratic Youth Federation of India on the Kozhikode beach on Monday, Mr. Vijayan said the Kerala Assembly had passed a resolution demanding that the Centre withdraw the recently legislated CAA. Letters to take up the move were written to the Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States such as Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. But they have not reacted till now, he said.

He wondered why they failed to adopt a resolution if these legislatures were sincere about conserving the secular credentials of the country. The people doubted the mindset of these leaders, Mr. Vijayan said.

Flays Mullappally

He said Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran had opposed a joint agitation with the CPI (M)-led front against the CAA. At the same time, the party adopted a different stand on various issues. This was evident in Jammu and Kashmir.

Mr. Vijayan said the people had not forgotten the stand taken by the Congress leadership on various occasions. The citizens of this country were not in the pocket of some people. However, it requires a firm policy to protect secularism. The government of a State had the right to object to any legislation against the principles of the Constitution. Kerala cannot support a law that offered people citizenship based on religion.

‘RSS agenda’

He said the Centre was attempting to implement the agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh through the citizenship law. The whole nation was against it. Initially the police had been employed to suppress the protests. Now these acts were carried out directly by the RSS. That was seen in the Jawaharlal Nehru University also, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ahp0a9/article30497275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07TVPAGE4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cong-playing-hide-and-seek-on-caa-cm/article30497277.ece
149,2020/01/06,Flood relief eludes State,"In what could be deemed as a case of political discrimination, the Centre has excluded Kerala from a calamity relief of ₹5,908 crore released to seven States on Monday. Kerala was one State that was battered by heavy flood in two successive years, 2018 and 2019, and is still struggling to source funds for rehabilitation of the victims.

The decision for releasing the additional assistance from the National Disaster Relief Fund was made after a high-level committee meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Delhi. A majority of the beneficiaries of the latest release are Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States such as Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tripura, and Assam. Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh too have got their due from the additional assistance cleared after the meeting.

State government officials at the Secretariat or the Resident Commissioner in Delhi are yet to get any response from the Centre to the State’s repeated pleas for funds, government sources said.

Earlier, a sum of ₹3,000 crore was sanctioned, against a demand for ₹5,000 crore, after the first bout of floods hit the State.

Last year’s flood

The Centre has not sanctioned any major relief after the flood wreaked extensive damage in the State last year, sources said.

The decision comes soon after the Centre rejected the design for a carnival float the State had presented for the Republic Day parade in Delhi. Kerala had been in the forefront of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 agitations and the Kerala Assembly had passed a resolution against it.

This may have prompted the Centre to ignore the State’s plea for more funds for rehabilitating flood victims, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/flood-relief-eludes-state/article30497251.ece

151,2020/01/06,KC(M) feud plays out in Kuttanad too,"The feud in the Kerala Congress (M) now appears moving from the rubber heartland to the State’s rice bowl.

After an intense fight over the Pala seat and a direct encounter at Akalakkunnam grama panchayat, the warring factions have set their eyes on the Assembly seat at Kuttanad, where a byelection is set to take place soon following the demise of Thomas Chandy.

Claims

The affirmation of their claims on the seat, reminiscent of the self-defeating fight in Pala, is sure to trouble the United Democratic Front (UDF) in the coming days.

At a district-level leadership meet here on Monday, Jose K. Mani asserted the party’s right over the Assembly seat.

“Kuttanad was given to the KC(M) in 2011 following deliberations within the UDF when the Congress wanted to contest from Punalur. We still hold the right to nominate a candidate to the seat,” he said. He also spoke about the faction’s plan to field its own candidates in the upcoming local body elections.

The KC(M) group led by party working chairman P.J. Joseph, on the other hand, appears determined not to give up this time as in Pala. “The seat belongs to us and there is no scope for any dispute. The party has received an assurance in this regard from the UDF,” Mr. Joseph told reporters, in response to Mr. Mani’s remark.

Meanwhile, the factional fight has put the UDF in Kottayam in an embarrassing position. Accusing the Mani group of not honouring the intra-party power-sharing pact, the Joseph faction now looks set to move no-confidence motions against leaders of the rival faction at the Changanassery municipality and the Kanjirappally block panchayat.

Demands

“The UDF has acknowledged our demands as legitimate but is doing nothing to implement them. So we are forced to move the motion,” said Saji Manjakadambil, district president of the KC(M) Joseph faction.

Sophi Joseph,a Mani loyalist, was to step down from the president post of the Kanjirappally block on November 20 last year to enable Mariyamma Joseph of the Joseph faction to occupy the seat. At the Changanassery municipality, Sajan Francis, a Joseph loyalist, was to take over the local body’s chairman post from Lalichan Kunniparambil, a Mani group loyalist, in August for the remaining term of 15 months.

With the factional feud reaching a new high after the Pala byelection, the Mani faction backed out of these agreements brokered by the UDF.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mzaes/article30497056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kuttanad-mapcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kcm-feud-plays-out-in-kuttanad-too/article30497057.ece
152,2020/01/06,Stir to continue till CAA is withdrawn: IUML,"The protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) will continue until the Central government withdraws the “draconian law,” Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) national general secretary P.K. Kunhalikutty has said.

The nationwide protests were loud enough to open the eyes of the Central government, he said here on Monday. “The protests rising from the citadels of the BJP have shaken that party,” he said.

He said the BJP was aiming at creating violence at the slightest instance. The IUML had postponed its youth wing’s protest plans scheduled for January 15, the day of Home Minister Amit Shah’s arrival in Kerala, he said. The protests were postponed in order to avoid violence.

A major protest rally would take place on the Kozhikode beach on January 18 under United Democratic Front’s banner, he said. Several national leaders, including Kapil Sibal, would attend the Kozhikode rally, he said.

The IUML held a joint meeting of its parliamentary party members and high-power committee members at Panakkad on Monday. Party State president Syed Hyderali Shihab Thangal presided over the meeting.

153,2020/01/06,"LDF MLA, Sunni leader in trouble","A Left-backed Independent MLA and a prominent leader of one of the Sunni factions in the State landed in trouble on Monday after their photographs posing with pamphlets supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act [CAA] handed over by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders went viral on social media.

Nasar Faizy Koodathai, functionary of the Samastha Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama, is accused of accepting the pamphlet at a time when the organisation is holding events across the State against the legislation.

The incident occurred during the house visits being undertaken by the BJP to explain the party’s position on the issue.

Faizy suspended

Mr. Faizy was later suspended by the organisation from all the posts he had been holding. Karat Razack, MLA of Koduvally, too was found in a similar situation.

Later, both Mr. Razack and Mr. Faizy came up with explanations through social media posts. While Mr. Faizy apologised to the organisation, its activists and secular-minded people, Mr. Razack condemned the alleged bid by divisive forces who circulated his photo in a “misleading way”.

The Sunni leader claimed that he had expressed his opposition to the CAA to the local BJP leaders who visited him. “But, I should have declined their demand to take a photograph. It was a lapse,” Mr. Faizy wrote on Facebook.

Meanwhile, Mr. Razack said that he had voiced his objections against the CAA when the BJP leaders handed over the pamphlet. He claimed that he had opposed the anti-minority decisions.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ldf-mla-sunni-leader-in-trouble/article30496995.ece
154,2020/01/06,HC orders protection for Muthoot staff,"Employees of Muthoot Finance who are willing to work shall be provided adequate security to join duty, the High Court has directed.

It was on a writ petition seeking police protection for the employees that the court issued the order on Monday. The court directed to implead the Chief Secretary, the Home Secretary, and the Director General of Police in the case. On Monday, striking employees of the company tried to block those who reported for duty at the head office as part of their protest demanding reinstatement of those expelled from the company.

160 staff dismissed

The police prevented the striking employees when they raised slogans against the company and tried to block the staff who had reported for duty in the morning. The indefinite strike was declared after the company expelled over 160 employees in 43 branches across the State in December. The protest is being held under the aegis of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU).

Allegation

The employees whose services were terminated alleged that the company had expelled them for participating in the 52-day strike from August 20 last year demanding better salary.

George Alexander, Managing Director of Muthoot Finance, said the company would not be able to reinstate the employees. “There is an excess of 800 employees in Kerala.

155,2020/01/06,Thiruvalla bypass to be opened on May 31,"The Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP) will be completing the work on the much sought-after bypass project at Thiruvalla before May 31, according to Project Director M.G. Rajamanikyam.

Mr. Rajamanikyam was talking to reporters after reviewing the progress of the work on Monday. Mathew T. Thomas, MLA, was present.

He said the work on the Mazhuvangaduchira-Mallapally Road reach would be completed in the first week of March.

The work on the viaduct had to be completed for opening the Ramanchira-Mallappally Road reach in the next four months, he said. Mr. Rajamanikyam said the KSTP would open the Thiruvalla Bypass for the public on May 31.

The work on the ₹33-crore bypass project was formally launched by former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy in December 2014, fixing October 2016 as the deadline for its completion. However, the project had got into legal wrangles over land acquisition. This, coupled with the abandoning of the work midway by the contractor two years ago, badly affected the project.

Design changed

The MLA said the KSTP had to change the design of the bypass on its northern end portion owing to certain technical flaws in the earlier plan.

Previously, the decision was to raise the bypass portion near Ramanchira to a height of 12 metres by filling it with earth. However, experts found that raising the road to such a height, without constructing strong protection walls on either side, would invite technical problems.

The KSTP expert team had revised the plan and designed a 220-metre flyover, estimated at ₹37.5 crore, for the northern end portion of the bypass that links the Thiruvalla-Mallappally Road with Ramanchira. The KSTP steering committee had re-tendered the work, after obtaining clearance from the World Bank, which is funding the MC Road development.

Mr. Thomas said the Thiruvalla Bypass was part of the major development work on the Chengannur-Ettumanur stretch of the MC Road under KSTP. The bypass, once completed, would ease the traffic congestion in the town to a great extent, he said.

M.C. Sushama, KSTP Executive Engineer; Cherian Polachirackal, municipal chairman; Shaji Thiruvalla, councillor; and C.B. Subhash, Assistant Executive Engineer, were present.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ntvyeb/article30496989.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07tvptrajamanikyam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/thiruvalla-bypass-to-be-opened-on-may-31/article30496990.ece

158,2020/01/06,Man murders woman before killing himself,"A man allegedly murdered a woman he knew by slitting her throat before committing suicide in Karakkonam, close to the State border, on Monday.

According to the police, the deceased persons were identified as Ashika, 19, and Anu, 20, both of who hailed from the same locality in Karakkonam.

The incident occurred by around 10 a.m. after Anu, who worked as a bus conductor, barged into Ashika’s house. While Ashika’s grandmother was present in the house, her parents had gone out for work. Anu purportedly forced Ashika into a room and locked the door before her grandmother could react. Soon, a group of neighbours who rushed to the house on hearing Ashika’s screams broke open the door to find the duo lying in a pool of blood.

According to the Vellarada police, Anu is suspected to have slit Ashika’s throat using a broken bottle, before killing himself using the object. While Ashika was confirmed dead after being taken to a hospital nearby, Anu succumbed to his injuries while being rushed to the Government Medical College Hospital here.

The duo are believed to have been involved in a relationship until Ashika, who has been pursuing a beautician course, decided to part ways at the insistence of her family. She had also filed a complaint against Anu at the police station last April, accusing him of stalking and harassing her.

The issue had then been settled by the police in the presence of the duo’s parents, an official said.

Ms. Haridas began her march from Thattamangalam in the Chittur constituency and concluded at Alathur. V.D. Satheesan, MLA, inaugurated the march by handing over the flag to Ms. Haridas.

Mr. Satheesan accused the Centre of trying to pit the people against each other by dividing them in the name of religion. He said the BJP government was trying to divert the people’s attention from major issues faced by the country. He said the country was going through the worst economic crisis as the inevitable consequences of demonetization and GST implementation.

RSS agenda

Addressing the long march led by Mr. Sreekandan at Thiruvazhiyodu, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that the BJP was aiming a giant agenda of Hindu Rashtra through the CAA.

“Hindu Rashtra is an RSS agenda. The CAA is not merely against the Muslims. It is going to affect the country badly in general. The country is being led to a destructive stage,” he said.

Mr. Chennithala said that Modi government was trying to implement what Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse wanted. The BJP will destroy the country, he said.

He said that several Muslims and the British had ruled the country, but none of them had tried to destroy the religious pluralism of the country. DCC secretary O. Vijayakumar presided. C.V.

161,2020/01/06,Proposals galore at CM’s conclave,"Gender equality, environmental issues, water conservation, waste disposal, modern farming methods and disaster management were some of the key issues that were discussed at the Chief Minister’s Student Leaders’ Conclave at Farook College, near here, on Monday.

Students from Calicut University, Kannur University, Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, Sree Sankaracharya Sanskrit University, Kerala Agricultural University, Kerala Kalamandalam, and Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University were present at the interactive event with functionaries of students unions in colleges and universities. There were a couple of aurally challenged students among the participants.

When student leaders urged the Chief Minister to ensure timely conduct of their examinations, Mr. Vijayan said that steps had already been taken for the purpose.

Drug-free campuses

While some others sought the government’s help to rid campuses of drug addiction, the Chief Minister said students’ unions and parent teachers’ association too need to chip in. A few of them sought measures to remove superstitious beliefs from the minds of students.

A few others sought gender equality on campuses. They envisioned a time when transgender people are elected to students’ unions.

A majority of those who spoke at the event highlighted the need for adopting proper waste management practices in the State. Mr. Vijayan said that lessons on waste segregation should be taught from an early age itself at home.

Disaster response

When students expressed their willingness to be part of disaster management, the Chief Minister said that they would be given the opportunity to join the people’s disaster response force to be set up by the government.

Anyone aged above 18 can join the force and the members will be trained by expert teams. Those who are already part of the National Cadet Corps and National Service Schemes can join the force, Mr. Vijayan said.

Responding to another suggestion, the Chief Minister said that modern farming methods would be encouraged to remove the misconception that agriculture is non-profitable.

163,2020/01/06,Plan to do away with internal assessment,"The Left Democratic Front government is planning to do away with the practice of internal assessment for college students in the State. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel announced this at the Chief Minister’s Student Leaders’ Conclave held at Farook College, near here, on Monday.

The event, an interaction with functionaries of students unions in colleges as well as universities, was a second of its kind in the State.

Students from Calicut University, Kannur University, Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, Sree Sankaracharya Sanskrit University, Kerala Agricultural University, Kerala Kalamandalam, and Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University were present.

Mr. Vijayan said that steps had been taken to ensure that students did not fail in examination only because of their bad performance during internal assessment. The practice itself could be done away with soon, he said.

Syllabus revision

The Chief Minister was responding to the suggestions of students on the issue. The syllabus in universities would be revised in the next academic year, Mr. Vijayan said.

Dr. Jaleel told mediapersons later that the alleged revengeful actions against students in engineering colleges by management and teachers were being curbed. “The Kerala Technological University has already decided that there will be no minimum marks for internal assessment. This will be extended to all other universities in the State in the next academic year,” Mr. Jaleel said.

Mr. Vijayan also said that the government was considering 50% reservation for women in college students’ unions. He pointed out that the demand was pertinent in view of the presence of a high number of girl students.

24-hour libraries

University libraries would remain open 24 hours and there would not be any restriction for girl students, Mr. Vijayan said.

The Chief Minister said that reading of the preamble of the Constitution would be made a daily affair in schools in the State.

There are plans to introduce sex education for students. Though a conservative section had always opposed it, there was a need to change with the times, Mr. Vijayan said.

164,2020/01/06,K-RERA to form conciliation forums for dispute redressal,"The newly-formed Kerala Real Estate Regulatory Authority (K-RERA) is set to establish ‘conciliation forums’ for ensuring speedy resolution of disputes that may arise between real estate developers and home buyers.

While the details are yet to be finalised, RERA chairman P.H. Kurian said here on Monday that the forums could have, in addition to the aggrieved parties, a representative of real estate forums such as the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI), a trained conciliation officer assigned by K-RERA and a reputed NGO specialising in consumer protection in the sector.

It was expected that 20-30% of the disputes that arose between builders and buyers could be amicably settled by bringing the aggrieved parties to the negotiating table. And, depending on the number of cases, such forums could be set up at the district level if needed, Mr. Kurian said.

Section 32(g) of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, required State-level RERAs to facilitate ‘amicable conciliation of disputes between the promoters and the allottees (buyers) through dispute settlement forums set up by the consumer or promoter associations.”

Trained officers

K-RERA, which had a formal launch on January 1 this year, would take steps to post trained officers to guide the conciliation process, Mr. Kurian said.

By January-end, K-RERA hopes to appoint a retired district judge as adjudicating officer for handling compensation claims. An appellate authority also will be established soon for handling the appeals on K-RERA decisions.

Designed to protect consumer interests in the real estate sector and weed out fly-by-night operators and other malpractices, RERA requires mandatory registration of all real estate projects where the land area under development exceeds 500 square metres or the number of apartments being developed is more than eight inclusive of all phases. Real estate agents also are required to register with K-RERA.

Three real estate projects and around 12 real estate agents have been registered so far. A number of applications are pending. K-RERA is expecting a registration of between 300 and 400 projects.

Grading projects

The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, empowers State RERAs to grade real estate projects and promoters.

In Kerala, where RERA was taking its first steps, this would not be introduced immediately, Mr. Kurian said. “It can be done in another five years or so once the activities of K-RERA have stabilised. It is a transparent process of grading based on criteria such as timely delivery of projects,” he said.

K-RERA has urged potential buyers to book apartments only in RERA-registered projects and deal exclusively with RERA-registered real estate agents.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/k-rera-to-form-conciliation-forums-for-dispute-redressal/article30494721.ece
165,2020/01/06,"JNU violence: Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan calls it ‘Nazi-style attacks’; ‘RSS-sponsored fascism in action’, says Ramesh Chennithala","The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government and the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition in Kerala have condemned the attack on students and teachers of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Sunday in almost identical terms.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan castigated the violence unleashed by a set of unknown masked men wielding hockey and polo sticks as “Nazi-style attacks”.

As it happened: Masked goons strike terror in JNU, none arrested

Leader of the Kerala Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the onslaught was yet another galling example of the manifestation of “Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh-sponsored fascism in action”.

The CM also tweeted the images of injured JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh and professor Suchitra Sen on his official account.

He termed the attack as an “appalling display of intolerance running amok”. “The attackers intend to create an atmosphere of unrest and terror in the country. The scale of the attack reveals the extent of planning that went into it. Sangh Parivar must end this diabolical plan to silence universities with bloodshed. Remember, those students are speaking for all,” Mr. Vijayan tweeted.

Mr. Chennithala said the miscreants had targeted teachers and students in their hostels at night with impunity. Some reports suggested that the attack was in retaliation for the protests Union Home Minister Amit Shah faced in a neighbourhood in New Delhi. The country should rise as one in defiance against the attempts of the BJP to “choke protesting students in their blood”.

Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs, V. Muraleedharan, struck a different tone when he met reporters here. He alleged a “motley crew of Marxist, Congress and radicalised students” were responsible for the violence. The midnight attack on JNU students was part of a “larger political conspiracy” to portray that university students were en masse in revolt against the Central government.

The protests by students in JNU following the attack also resonated across campuses in Kerala. Activists of the Students Federation of India took to the road late on Sunday in an expression of solidarity with their striking compatriots in New Delhi. On Monday, the SFI held protest marches and meetings in various college campuses.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/30cpfn/article30454145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THCM-KERALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jnu-violence-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-calls-it-nazi-style-attacks-rss-sponsored-fascism-in-action-says-ramesh-chennithala/article30491933.ece
166,2020/01/06,Allu Arjun’s swag is matchless in 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo': Govind Padmasoorya,"His last outing in Tamil was a box office disaster.

But Kee, a film in which Malayalam actor Govind Padmasoorya (more famous as GP) played the antagonist, was instrumental in landing him a character in the upcoming Allu Arjun film directed by Trivikram Srinivas, Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (AVPL).

“I play the villain in this film too. But it is not a ruthless character like in Kee because AVPL is a fun film. It is a family drama with comedy and action... like how a Vijay sir film would be,” says GP, as we sit down for a conversation at a luxury hotel in T Nagar, Chennai.

Anticipation around AVPL is already sky high, considering the massive popularity of its songs.

Terming the musical score by Thaman S as a hit is an understatement; songs like ‘Samajavaragamana’, sung by Sid Sriram, and ‘Ramuloo Ramulaa’, sung by Anurag Kulkarni, have been viewed over 120 million times on YouTube.

For GP, though, the major takeaway from AVPL ought to be his versatility as an actor.

“I hope that after seeing [AVPL] people may cast me for a performance character... a positive role. Or, perhaps, a second hero in a big film. This is what I’m anticipating. After AVPL, they may not always want to cast me as a villain. There are more possibilities that I am trying to open up, but I don’t know how people are going to perceive,” he adds.

Excerpts from an interview:

Tell us about your role in the film...

My character’s name is Paidthili. It is a very interesting name. I play the son to Samuthirakani sir’s character in the film. He plays a very rustic Telugu person, but my character is sophisticated because he has a degree from an American university.

What convinced you to sign the film?

When I heard it was an Allu Arjun-Trivikram Srinivas sir film, I did not have to think of anything else.

They were coming together for the third time after two blockbusters, and the film is produced under the Geetha Arts banner. I wanted that brand association.

How do you explain Allu Arjun’s popularity in Kerala?

When Bunny (Allu Arjun’s nickname) started, he gave us these kind of love stories we would not have dared to make. Like Arya (2004), it was considered cheesy at the time, but we were ready to accept if it came from another film industry. It was a fun package, and his looks, dance... it just got into the girls and then the boys.

The main thing for Bunny is his presentation as an entertainer. We have a lot of actors in Kerala, but nobody has taken his space... where you see unimaginable, incredible dance steps, over-the-top stunts, and with such magnitude. Unfortunately, Kerala cannot afford the kind of budget that Telugu films can.

Allu Arjun is a major star in Telugu cinema. How was it working with someone of his calibre?

I was amazed by his humility. When he is on the set, all eyes are on him. You notice people’s body language change, everyone wants to acknowledge him. He also makes sure to acknowledge everyone.

By the time he leaves the set, he would have made sure that others think, ‘Bunny sir has noticed me’. That is an amazing quality. Besides, when you are a part of these films, it is like being in an acting workshop.

Can you elaborate...

With Bunny, it is interesting to watch him improvise a scene. Him and Samuthirakani sir do it very differently. Bunny knows his strength. He brings his swag into the action scenes, dialogues and dance.

He uses his entire body to say a dialogue, and only he can carry it off well. If I tried to do it, I’m sure it would come across as over-the-top. He is very comfortable with the loudness he brings in.

With Samuthirakani sir, the effort he puts in to understand the nuances of folk Telugu... he knows very little Telugu but he writes and learns it to get the diction and mannerism correct.

Both these actors are like textbooks for you. It is a delight for me to watch them perform.

What is the core concept of AVPL?

The title means... There in Vaikunthapuram. Everything happens in the house, and Samuthirakani and I are the outsiders.

If you look at the film from a different angle, it is about three different father-son relationships, and the attitudes they share.

There is Jayaram sir and Sushant, Allu Arjun and Murali Sharma, and Samuthirakani and I.

One father does not respect his son, thinks whatever he says is not right and suppresses him. The other son does not know what to say, and the father is looking forward for his son to say something.

The third is very aggressive, and his father thinks whatever he says is good.

You are still waiting for a big opportunity in Malayalam films...

I’m looking for a lead role in Malayalam. Earlier, it was GP, the television host, trying to make it in films. Now I feel confident, after having done films in Tamil and Telugu. And in Kerala, the film industry is in such a position now that if the script works, it does not matter who the lead is, that film will work. It is just a matter of time.

Govind Padmasoorya | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Would you take the parallel cinema route to fame in Malayalam?

If you want to become big, if you want to sustain in an industry, you will have to expand your horizon. Right now, doing small films could work for some time. But you become a star when you have releases on festival days... like an Onam release.

So, I’m not looking to build a niche image. Every actor wants that, but I don’t think that is a good idea. You have to be an Aamir Khan to pull off a Taare Zameen Par or Dangal.

That is the space which every actor should aim at... where when you do a Moothon, you also do a Love Action Drama.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mllc07/article30494303.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AVPL-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/allu-arjuns-swag-is-matchless-in-ala-vaikunthapurramuloo-govind-padmasoorya/article30494310.ece

She has also requested everyone to focus on a vegetarian diet or at least consume less meat.

The actress took to Instagram to share a very disturbing picture of a little girl wearing a mask, standing with a rescued koala in her arms, while there is a massive fire and flames rising in her background.

Amy wrote: “Australia, we are with you Au. Dozens of people have lost their lives, thousands left without homes and OVER HALF A BILLION ANIMALS HAVE DIED! It’s so bad that there are fears of entire species of animals and plants being wiped out. This is a climate emergency and if this doesn’t ring alarm bells I don’t know what will.”

When I read the news, my heart breaks at seeing all of these disasters but it also makes me more determined to do my part! You can too... change to a plant based diet or at least consider more veggies and less meat to begin with.”

Urging everyone to donate to the cause, the actress mentioned: “Choose wisely/buy less. Support the people who are supporting our planet. PLEASE DONATE @nswrfs @thuie”.

169,2020/01/06,Coimbatore filmmaker Arun Karthick’s 'Nasir' gets nominated for the prestigious Tiger Award at the International Film Festival Rotterdam,"“Candid portrait of a gentleman's life reduced to second-class existence as a Muslim in an India characterised by rising Hindu nationalism”. That is the summary of the film Nasir as written on the website of International Film Festival of Rotterdam (IFFR). It is one among the 10 films that has been chosen for IFFR’s prestigious Tiger Awards competition. The film’s director Arun Karthick, who is from Coimbatore, is overjoyed. “It’s indeed a big achievement for an Indian film to be chosen for the main competitive section. It will now reach a wider audience around the world. Tiger Awards is the premier section. Ten films compete for the award and the winner gets a cash award of €40,000!”

Arun says the relevance of the story —animosity towards minorities — is expressed characteristically in Nasir. “When Bero Beyer, the director of IFFR, announced the selected films (which was telecast around the world through a virtual live press conference) he described Nasir as a peculiar and deeply human film made by a self-made filmmaker from India. It has been chosen for the unique narrative style with which the story has been told.

IFFR is more cutting edge than a Berlin Film Festival or the Cannes. “They encourage new experiments, different narratives, and films that are avant garde! A Tiger Award nomination is good for the film as there are just 10 films in all and people will watch all, unlike the big festivals where the competitive section often has over 25 films.”

Nasir is an Indo-Dutch co-production and has already won the prestigious Hubert Bals Fund (HBF) of International Film Festival of Rotterdam (IFFR). The film is jointly produced by Stray Factory, Rinkel Film, Magic Hour films, Uncombed Buddha, Harman Ventures and Cent percent films. “The film was shot in Coimbatore but the sound and colour correction work was done in Amsterdam. The collaboration has also brought Dutch film distributors on board. They will take Nasir to art house theatres in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. The French company, Stray Dogs, will distribute the film in rest of the world.”

Award matters International Film Festival of Rotterdam’s Tiger Awards celebrate innovation, especially from up-and-coming filmmakers. They select filmmakers who are just three films old. They welcome films that try new forms and breaks away from existing film making language and grammar.

Arun Karthick’s first film Sivapuranam/ A Strange Case of Shiva, was screened at IFFR’s Bright Future category in 2016. Sivapuranam is a ‘one person drama’ about a young designer who gets obsessed with his world. There are no dialogues and no song or dance. It’s an Indie film. The film did the rounds at Mumbai Film Festival, Jaffna Film Festival to name a few. He completed the film with the financial award of Rs. 10 lakh from NFDC’s Film Bazaar.

Arun describes Nasir as “my response to the hatred that minorities are facing”. “The film stays true to the adaptation of a short story by Tamil author Dilip Kumar. Even while pitching for funding, we got very positive responses to the film because of the universality of the theme.” The protagonist of this film, Nasir, is a salesman in a small-town. “The film narrates one day in the life of a simple salesman. Politics is not spoken with words but made to feel through the detailed telling of an ordinary Muslim’s life. I am excited and curious to know how people will view it. I hope it resonates with audiences of all strata and create ripples.""

Meanwhile, Arun is writing the script for his third film, a village drama. It is about a feud in families that run brick kilns in his native Thadagam near Coimbatore.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7n7tci/article30502437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nasir-final,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/coimbatore-filmmaker-arun-karthicks-second-film-nasir-wins-a-tiger-special-jury-awards-at-the-international-film-festival-rotterdam/article30493241.ece

The actor accepted the trophy with an expletive-laden speech, much of which was muted out.

He started by thanking the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) for making meals at the award gala and then going on to pay tribute to his fellow nominees.

In the first of a few censored moments, he said: “To my fellow nominees, we all know there’s no f**king competition between us.

“I’m inspired by you. I can’t believe the beautiful, mesmerising and unique work you’ve all done this year. I really do feel honored to be mentioned with you.”

He went on to thank “Joker” director Todd Phillips, and apologise for being “such a pain in the a**”.

Thanking Phillips, the actor said: “You convinced me to do this movie and you encouraged me to give everything and be sincere. I am such a pain in the a**. I cannot believe you put up with me.”

The actor, then, stressed on the importance of helping with climate change issues such as the raging bushfires in Australia.

“Contrary to popular belief I don’t want to rock the boat. The boat is f**king rocked,” he said.

“It’s really nice that so many people come up and sent in their well—wishes, but we have to do more than that” the actor said, adding: “I have not always been a virtuous man. I’m learning so much so many of you in this room... You all have given me multiple opportunities to get it right. I am deeply grateful.”

The actor also pointed out that his fellow actors don’t need to take jets to Palm Springs.

“Hopefully, we can be unified and actually make some changes. It’s great to vote but sometimes we have to take that responsibility on ourselves and make changes and sacrifices in our own lives. I hope that we can do that. We don’t have to take private jets to Palm Springs sometimes or back, please.

“I’ll try to do better and I hope you will too. Thank you so much for putting up with me. I’m so grateful for this night and all of you thank you,” he concluded.

With the win, Phoenix has now become the second actor to win the prize from the HFPA for portraying the Joker. In 2009, Heath Ledger won a Golden Globe posthumously in the Best Supporting Actor category for “The Dark Knight”.

“I swear to God, I’m not nearly this emotional at home,” said the versatile actor in his acceptance speech.

Hanks, who was bestowed with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association’s top award, addressed the audience, most of whom he said he would “pay to see them get their cars washed“.

Chosen by the HFPA board members, the Cecil B deMille award is given annually to a talented individual who has made a lasting impact in the world of entertainment.

The 63-year-old actor reflected on his lengthy career and thanked his co-stars over the years, from whom he “stole” something or other.

“You’re a dope if you don’t steal from everybody you’ve ever worked with. And I have stolen from the likes of the people that only need one name, like Meryl, like Denzel, like Antonio, like Meg, like Julia, like Sally Field — even though that’s two names, it’s still one. But I have also been made better by watching the examples of some of the greatest actors that have ever walked the stage,” he said.

Hanks added, showing up on time is “one of the greatest and most liberating acts you can give yourself in a movie.”

The actor, an eight-time Golden Globe winner and 15-time nominee, also paid tributes to the directors and screenwriters he has worked with.

“It’s those moments as an actor where everybody I’ve ever worked with has helped me get to that place — sometimes it’s three o’clock in the morning and sometimes it’s 11 at night — but you just have to somehow put it all together, have faith in what the process is, and go there,” he said.

Hanks underscored the power of having a “head full of ideas“.

“That was the greatest lesson a young actor could possibly ever have first of all, the head full of ideas. Bring anything, try anything, they might not use it. If it stinks, they won’t use it.

“Knowing the text, and it’s not just your lines, it’s the whole thing. It’s the red dot. It’s the theme of the movie. You’ve got to know it. You might not be right in the opinion you bring to it, but you’ve got to come at it with some direction,” he said.

The actor closed his speech with a filmmaking analogy which resulted in a standing ovation from the audience.

“There is a saying in motion pictures, back when it was shot on film, that you could not move on to the next scene until the gate was good. ... Thank you, HFPA. Thank you all here.

“Thank you for all your inspiration and all of your work and all the struggle that you guys go through in order to hit the marks and tell the truth. I have checked the gate. The gate is good. Thank you,” Hanks said.

Hanks is both a critically-acclaimed actor and beloved star who has iconic films such as “Big”, “Forrest Gump”, “Saving Private Ryan”, “Cast Away”, among others to his credit.

His upcoming projects include WWII drama “Greyhound”, which he also wrote, the post-apocalyptic “BIOS” and pre-Civil War drama “News of the World”.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/v65oqi/article30492134.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AWARDS-GOLDENGLOBES,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/emotional-tom-hanks-accepts-cecil-b-demille-award-at-golden-globes/article30492135.ece

The pregnant actress spoke about abortion, stating, “I’ve tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just a series of events that happened to me, but one that I can stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over. Sometimes, messy and scrawling, sometimes careful and precise. But one that I had carved with my own hand, and I wouldn’t have been able to do this without employing a woman’s right to choose.”

Williams, who has a daughter with the late actor Heath Ledger, added that as women and as girls, things can happen to “our bodies that are not our choice.” She said that she has been lucky to have control over the happenings her life. “I wouldn’t have been able to do this without employing a woman’s right to choose — to choose when to have my children and with whom.”

“Now, I know my choices might look different than yours, but thank God, or whomever you pray to, that we live in a country founded on the principle that I am free to live by my faith and you are free to live by yours.”

She also implored women across the USA to vote in the 2020 election: “Women, 18 to 118, when it comes time to vote, vote in your own self-interest. It’s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them. But don’t forget, we are the largest voting body in this country. Let’s make it look more like us.”

Her speech was received to great applause from the audience, several of them who were emotional. Williams is currently engaged to Hamilton director Thomas Kail, with whom she is expecting a baby.

Patricia Arquette was another actress who spoke about the current goings-on in the world, describing the USA as a “country on the brink of war”. The performer, who won Best supporting actress in a TV series, limited series or TV film for The Act, said that, “We will see a country on the brink of war, the United States of America, a president tweeting out a threat of 52 bombs including cultural sites.”

She added, “Young people are risking their lives, traveling across the world, people not knowing if bombs are going to drop on their kids’ heads, and the continent of Australia is on fire. So while I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world.”

Ellen DeGeneres, who accepted the Carol Burnett Award for lifetime achievement, also spoke about the Australia fires in her speech: “Australia, I love you; my heart goes out to everyone who is suffering in Australia, all the animals that we’ve lost.”

Finally, Joaquin Phoenix who won Best actor in a film – drama, for Joker, said he “didn’t want to rock the boat, but that it had already been rocked.”

It’s great to vote, but sometimes we have to take that responsibility on ourselves and make changes and sacrifices in our own lives,” he stated, adding, “We don’t have to take private jets to Palm Springs for the awards.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/99sb29/article30491948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIX77THANNUALGOLDENGLOBEAWARDS-SHOW,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/michelle-williams-delivers-powerful-speech-on-womens-rights-at-golden-globes-2020/article30491949.ece
175,2020/01/06,Ricky Gervais roasts Hollywood with explicit jokes at Golden Globes,"Ricky Gervais kicked off the Golden Globes by telling the audience his fifth time hosting would be his last, then proceeded to deliver an expletive-laced skewering of Hollywood’s elites.

True to his reputation, Gervais opened the show on Sunday with a mix of evisceration and exasperation, pretending to confuse Joe Pesci for Baby Yoda, calling the Hollywood Foreign Press Association racist and declaring Netflix’s takeover of Hollywood.

The acerbic comedic actor was bleeped multiple times, once for referring to a body part of Dame Judi Dench, and then when he advised the night’s winners to stick to thanking their agents and their Gods, not lecturing the general public.

“Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg, so if you win, come up, accept your award, thank your agent and your God and (expletive) off,” he said, referring to the teen climate change activist.

Gervais said the audience full of powerful TV and movie executives were all “terrified” of journalist Ronan Farrow, who won a Pulitzer for his reporting on disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, who goes on trial in New York City on Monday for sexual assault. Gervais told the crowd about Farrow,“He’s coming for you.”

After another Weinstein joke that earned a sharp response toward the end of the broadcast, he snapped back at the crowd, “I didn’t do it. You did it.”

When some groaned about his joke about the former financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in jail after being arrested for allegedly sex trafficking girls, he responded: “Shut up. I know he’s your friend.”

Gervais also spoke about Leonardo DiCaprio and Quentin Tarantino film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.

“[It’s] almost three hours long – it’s an epic,” he said, and added,“Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere, and by the end his date was too old for him!”

“Even Prince Andrew is like, ‘C’mon, Leo. Mate, you’re nearly 50,’""added Gervais, much to the shock of everyone present there.

Few in the audience should have been surprised by Gervais’ tone. He’s taken delight in dicing up the Hollywood elite with his jokes with his previous hosting stints.

Gervais said multiple times during the evening that he’d be giving up his hosting duties, but HFPA President Lorenzo Soria wanted an assurance from the foul-mouthed Gervais when Soria stepped on stage after the bleeped monologue: “Ricky, you keep saying this is your last year hosting. For God’s sake, please put it in writing.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5wwemu/article30491623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/77THANNUALGOLDENGLOBEAWARDS-SHOW,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ricky-gervais-roasts-hollywood-with-explicit-jokes-at-golden-globes/article30491624.ece
176,2020/01/06,"Chiranjeevi, Vijayashanthi banter steals the show","The pre-release event of Sarileru Neekevvaru directed by Anil Ravipudi and starring Mahesh Babu, Vijayashanthi and Rashmika Mandanna was a starry event as expected. On Sunday evening, the surprise factor was having Chiranjeevi as the chief guest.

Speaking at the event, Chiranjeevi stole hearts when he heaped praises on Vijayashanthi, with whom he starred in a numner of films. The camaraderie was evident and was met with loud cheers. Chiranjeevi acknowledged Vijayashanthi with the monikers with which she’s often referred to — ‘lady superstar’ and ‘lady Amitabh Bachchan’ — and stated that he’s looking forward to watching her again on screen. He recalled how they were not just co-stars but friends who would meet for family functions often. When he tried to shift the topic to how both of them entered politics, on a lighter vein Vijayashanthi retorted that he talk about cinema and not politics. The two have acted together in about 20 films.

Chiranjeevi also mentioned that the Sarileru Neekevvaru team surprised him when he learnt that they shot the big budget star-driven film in five months and were ready to release it within a short film. The actor stated that the initial posters of Mahesh as an Army officer stoked his curiosity to see the film.

The Anil Ravipudi film also stars Prakash Raj, Sangeetha, Rao Ramesh, Hariteja, Rajendra Prasad and others. Rathnavelu is the cinematographer and the music is by Devi Sri Prasad.

178,2020/01/06,Nikhil Siddhartha is enthused by the reception to ‘Arjun Suravaram’,"With the success of his recent film Arjun Suravaram co-starring Lavanya Tripathi, actor Nikhil Siddhartha is back in the reckoning. The debacle of his earlier film Kiraak Party at the box office taught him that people are not willing to watch mediocre films in theatres any more; it’s mandatory to deliver something worthwhile, he says. The success of Arjun Suravaram has made the actor enthusiastic and responsible.

As the Tamil film Kanithan (2016) was not on the digital platform, its Telugu remake Arjun Suravaram was lapped up by Telugu audience. Nikhil shares the journey with the film: He recalls, “It had a good point and the concept is relevant. There are people who use fake certificates for education, visa and jobs. Many unqualified people are getting jobs due to fake certificates.We have seen [films on] corruption in general but not the modus operandi and how high-level corruption works [in the domain of fake certificates]. I believed that if such a story is narrated well, people will watch it.”

The release of the film kept getting postponed from early 2019, before it finally arrived in theatres at the end of November. The postponements gave rise to speculations. The actor says, “I felt ravaged. A middleman not related to the film at all sold it to different people. Usually a film is stalled because of nil business, here the business was done for a profit and we were kept waiting. The middle man, who gave an advance of one crore, sold it to three others for a profit and was absconding. Three people had the rights. We made a film on fraud and it got involved in a fraud. A legal process was initiated and they were disqualified. The court cancelled the contract. Only after paying the complete money the producer should sell it but here things work differently, it works on trust. Fresh business was done and the process took six months.”

Arjun Suravaram was then screened to distributors since the delay led to doubts in the content. Chiranjeevi saw the film and felt the concept should reach more people and help create awareness about the issue of fake certificates.

The film also opened to favourable reviews. Chiranjeevi’s presence helped the film and Nikhil says he is ever grateful to him and also those who watched the film. He adds, “The teaser was well accepted, the song was a hit but till the night before the film’s release we were tensed. The same thing happened with Karthikeya, a broker sold the film multiple times to different people. I understand now that the producer should do background check on those investing or buying the film.”

Nikhil danced at the pre release event, it was a tribute to his favourite star — Chiranjeevi. He reveals that he took days to practise.

Though the film released and saw good numbers, Nikhil was still restless. He calls it a tense 14 days. The movie finally sold for ₹6 crore and got more than ₹11 crore. He says it is very important to sell the film to distributors for at least a nominal profit so that everyone stays happy and safe.

Nikhil quips, “There was a time when actors believed they should do three films a year, so that even if two flopped, the third would be a hit. Now the scenario has changed. You are good as your last film. Despite streaming platforms, people still come to watch a film in the theatre, so there is a responsibility on us to do a good job.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vrtj4t/article30491216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nikhil-new-film,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nikhil-siddhartha-is-enthused-by-the-reception-to-arjun-suravaram/article30491217.ece

Addressing the Legislative Assembly, Mr. Purohit said: “Tamil Nadu with its fully computerised, Aadhaar-enabled PDS operations, is able to operationalise the ‘One Nation One Ration Card’ scheme.” The Universal Public Distribution System (UPDS) of Tamil Nadu continued to be the model for other States to emulate, he said.

Though the State had a “normal” monsoon season this year, farmers were still awaiting their harvest. The Governor also appreciated Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami for announcing Pongal gift hampers and a cash gift of ₹1,000 per family, to enable the people of Tamil Nadu to celebrate Pongal festival with gaiety and fervour.

180,2020/01/06,$2.5 million initiative to support clean energy-based livelihood solutions in India,"The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) and social enterprise incubator Villgro Innovation Foundation have jointly launched a $2.5 million initiative to support at least five enterprises in India that are deploying innovative, clean energy-powered livelihood appliances.

The initiative, named ‘Powering Livelihoods’, will enable the selected enterprises to undertake large-scale commercial deployments over the next three years. The initiative will offer grant support of upto $250,000 to each enterprise to help them kick-off the commercial deployment of their product/appliance and to allow financial leverage for further fund raising in the form of equity/debt.

Based on needs assessment, enterprises will also be provided support services (upto $100,000) through strategic partnerships. This includes mentoring, capacity building, financial planning and modelling, and assistance on compliance and legal issues, with an end-goal to scale up commercial deployment.

The core focus areas of the initiative include agriculture & allied value chain/ cold storage sector, in which enterprises deploying appliances such as clean energy-powered and/or energy-efficient commercial food processors, cold storages, juicers, dryers, milk chillers, flour mills, milking machines, rice hullers and oil expellers.

Another focus is the textile sector, where enterprises are deploying appliances such as solar charkhas, sewing machines, paddle looms, jute machinery, and silk reelers which could improve productivity and reduce drudgery without harming the environment.

Applications for the initiative close on 15th January, 2020. For details, go to: http://poweringlivelihoods.org

181,2020/01/06,"DMK is a ‘waxing moon’, going from strength to strength, says Stalin","Opposition leader and DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday took issue with State Law Minister D. Jayakumar, who described the DMK as a “waning moon”, saying that the party’s growth in the Assembly, Parliament and rural local body polls had proved the Minister wrong.

“Today, we have 24 MPs in the Lok Sabha from nothing (five years ago). Our strength in the Assembly has increased from 89 to 100. In the previous local body elections we won 1,007 union councillor posts and now the number has gone up to 2,100. We had just 30 district panchayat councillors in 2011 and now we have increased the tally to 243. I leave it to your conclusion whether it is a waning moon or waxing moon,” he told reporters after staging a walkout from the Legislative Assembly.

Mr. Stalin said the DMK had boycotted the Governor’s address to highlight various issues including the debt of the government which had become a whopping ₹4 lakh crore, unemployment and failure of the Governor to take action on the Assembly resolution seeking the release of seven persons convicted for life in the former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

He said by supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) the AIADMK government had betrayed the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Muslims. Asked about the claim of the State Election Commissioner R. Palaniswamy that elections to the rural local bodies were held in a fair manner, he quipped, “He must have learnt the rules of election in the school of Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami.”

Mr. Stalin also condemned the attack on the students at Jawaharlal Nehru University and had asked party MP Tiruchi N.

182,2020/01/06,"Tamil Nadu will protect all citizens regardless of religion, creed, says Governor","Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Monday said that the State government would protect the interests of all citizens, irrespective of their religion or creed.

“The government of Tamil Nadu will ensure that the interests of all citizens regardless of religion or creed are protected,” he said in his customary address on the first day of this year’s Legislative Assembly session. The Governor added that the Tamil Nadu government would urge the Centre to provide dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in the State.

Tamil Nadu aimed to be an “inclusive society”, where socially deprived sections including Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Backward Classes (BCs), Most Backward Classes (MBCs), denotified communities, minorities and persons with disabilities were “safe, secure and empowered,” he said.

Through the Tamil Nadu Adi Dravidar Housing and Development Corporation, Tamil Nadu Backward Classes Economic Development Corporation and the Tamil Nadu Minorities Economic Development Corporation, “the economic development of persons belonging to SC, ST, BC, MBC and denotified communities and minorities is ensured,” the Governor said.

He said the State government was “fully committed” to the cause of social justice and would protect the 69 % reservation followed in Tamil Nadu for the SCs, STs, BCs, BC Muslims, MBCs and denotified communities. The 4% reservation in employment for persons with disabilities would be ensured and suitable posts identified in all categories to provide them with employment.

Diminution of funds flow from Centre to TN

“There has been a diminution in the overall flow of Central funds to Tamil Nadu. Contrary to the impression that the 14th Finance Commission’s recommendations increased the gross flow of resources from the Centre to the States, in reality there has been reduction in the gross transfers from the Centre to States,” Mr Purohit said.

Tamil Nadu was eagerly awaiting the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission and further was hopeful of a fair and equitable distribution of resources that rewarded efficiency and performance. He urged the Centre to settle the dues of Tamil Nadu at the earliest.

Reiterating Tamil Nadu government’s stand against the proposal to construct a dam across the Cauvery at Mekedatu by the Karnataka government, he urged the Centre and the Kerala government to accord clearances to strengthen the Mullaiperiyar dam.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jqo1wr/article30492946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06JANTH--GOVERNOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-will-protect-all-citizens-regardless-of-religion-creed-says-governor/article30492947.ece

Raising slogans in front of Periyar Statue near Central Bus Stand, the protesters, wearing black, hoisted a black flag near the statue.

Speaking at the protest, J. Kennedy, organiser and district secretary, Tamil Desiya Makkal Munnani said that they were against the atrocities and dangerous division of people across the nation. “The CAA is against the Constitution of the country. It is creating fear and unnecessary uncertainty among the common people,” he said.

Condemning the attack on the students of JNU, Mr. Kennedy alleged that the attack was pre-planned. “For the past five years, far- right organisations have been trying to bring higher educational institutions under their control.

During the course of the hearing, the State had submitted that the representation of the life convict for leave had not been considered due to the rural local body polls that were being held in the State. The Court said that with the polls now over, leave can be granted. “Let him spend time with his family this Pongal”, the judges said.

A persistent Mr. Stalin went on to raise certain objections and sought a chance to speak.

The Governor requested Mr. Stalin to use his “oratorical skills” during the debate in the House later but in vain. Mr. Stalin then led his party members out of the House.

Members of other Opposition parties and the DMK’s allies, the Congress and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), too followed suit. The Governor then went ahead with his speech.

190,2020/01/06,Information Commission pulls up PIO for not attending hearing,"The Tamil Nadu Information Commission has directed the Employees Provident Fund Organisation to pay a compensation of ₹5,000 to a pensioner after its Public Information Officer failed to appear for a hearing.

The hearing was necessitated by an appeal filed by V. Nandagopal of Ambur in Vellore district stating that he received no reply to his petition seeking details of pension updates from the PIO, Vellore. He wanted to know the increase in pension on the basis of the dearness allowance (DA) revision over the years.

With no reply forthcoming from the PIO and the first appellate authority, Mr. Nandagopal moved the Tamil Nadu Information Commission requesting its intervention and direction to the public authority in getting replies to 13 questions relating to his pension raised by him. When the Commission summoned the petitioner and the PIO for an enquiry, the latter failed to turn up on the designated date despite receiving a copy of the summons.

Compulsory attendance

State Information Commissioner S.T. Tamilkumar noted that the appearance of the PIO was compulsory as per the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Information Commission (Appeal Procedure) Rules 2012.

In the event of the PIO not being able to appear for the enquiry, the Commission should be intimated in writing, explaining the reasons for the same and a suitable officer must be deputed on his/her behalf.

Bringing on record the non-appearance of the PIO, Mr. Tamilkumar ordered that the petitioner, who was present for the enquiry, be given a compensation of ₹5,000 under Section 19(8)(b) of the Act.

In this case, the PIO neither intimated the Commission regarding his absence nor deputed an equally competent official to represent the organisation.

Directing the PIO to explain why departmental action should not be recommended against him for not complying with the rules of the Act, the State Information Commissioner said the public authority should compulsorily be present at the next hearing on a date that would be intimated later.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/information-commission-pulls-up-pio-for-not-attending-hearing/article30488813.ece
191,2020/01/06,Sixth phase excavation at Keeladi to begin,"The sixth phase of the excavations in Keeladi will begin in the second fortnight of January, alongside excavations in the Keeladi cluster – Konthagai, Agaram and Manalur.

The Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department (TNAD) has tied up with educational institutions to obtain their assistance during and after the exercise.

The initiative is likely to involve an association with a reputed international institution through the Madurai Kamaraj University.

The TNAD will also simultaneously begin excavations at Kodumanal in Erode district and Sivagalai and Adichanallur in Thoothukudi district. The State government had sought permission from the Archaeological Survey of India to excavate these sites, which was granted. The approval is valid till September. The Department is planning to adopt a rigorous documentation process for the excavations, including the one in Keeladi, where the process will be photographed and videographed.

“The excavations in the Keeladi cluster will be comprehensive, and will include a burial site at Konthagai and habitation sites at Agaram and Manalur,” an official of the TNAD told The Hindu.

Surveys with UAVs

A preliminary survey of all the sites is being carried out, and an aerial survey using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is being undertaken with the help of the Madras Institute of Technology, Chromepet.

Experts have visited the sites to map the places to be excavated and have identified potential locations for the exercise. As part of the comprehensive process being adopted this excavation season, the TNAD has tied up with various academic institutions.

One such association is with the Madurai Kamaraj University’s School of Biological Sciences, which is set to sign an MoU with an international university.

“The tie-up will be for conducting ancient DNA analysis,” the official said.

It has also teamed up with the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru, for metallurgy studies of artefacts, the French Institute of Pondicherry for undertaking pollen studies, and the Deccan College, Pune, for animal bone analysis.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/eln5rz/article30488797.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06KEELADIEXCAVATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sixth-phase-excavation-at-keeladi-to-begin/article30488798.ece
192,2020/01/06,‘Improper implementation of reservation in teacher recruitment’,"PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Sunday criticised the Teachers Recruitment Board (TRB) for improper implementation of the reservation policy in the appointment of postgraduate teachers across schools.

The list of candidates for the 2,144 vacant teacher positions was released on November 20 and January 2 and they both flouted the reservation policy, he said in a statement. He said 57 backlog vacancies (Most Backward Classes (54) and autism (3)) and 248 current vacancies should be filled properly – that is, backlog vacancies for MBC should be filled first and then 69% reservation should be applied to the rest of the available seats.

“But, backlog vacancies and current vacancies have been clubbed together in the list readied by the TRB. The Board has also sought to consider the MBC candidates who have qualified through the General Category under the MBC quota,” he said. If reservation was properly implemented, 28 more MBC candidates would have got jobs, in addition to the 103 beneficiaries, he said.

“The TRB isn’t ready to understand how it has gone against social justice.

Mr. Haasan, who decided against contesting the rural local body elections, filled up party positions to set up a robust social media team on Sunday. “Social media is playing a major role in creating political and social change. I am aware that the social media wing of the party has been functioning well. In 2021 Assembly elections, the role of IT and social media will be very important,” he said.

Speaking to The Hindu, Murali Appas, party spokesperson, said: “We didn’t have time before the Lok Sabha elections to create a robust team. We are aware that we need to up our social media game to win the 2021 Assembly elections. The focus is on that.”

The MNM has divided the team across eight zones in Tamil Nadu. The teams will be responsible not just for digital dissemination of information, but for providing feedback to the party headquarters about on-the-ground happenings, say party sources.

“We have appointed close to 800 members; there will soon be a person even at the block level,” said Mr. Appas.

195,2020/01/06,Karuppasamy Pandian rejoins AIADMK,"The former MLA V. Karuppasamy Pandian, who has been in and out of the AIADMK, rejoined the ruling party on Sunday.

Mr. Pandian, a three-time MLA from Tirunelveli district, was in the DMK until recently, before he called on party leaders O. Panneerselvam and Edappadi K. Palaniswami at their respective residences on Sunday. Mr. Pandian was elected to the Assembly for the first time in 1977 from Alangulam and three years later, Palayamkottai.

Key member

He was one of the key figures of the Jayalalithaa faction of the AIADMK at the time of the split in the party soon after the death of M.G. Ramachandran.

In April 2000, Mr. Pandian, who was Tirunelveli district secretary and deputy general secretary of the party, was expelled.

Three years later, he joined the DMK. He won the Tenkasi Assembly seat on the DMK ticket in 2006. Five years later, he lost to R. Sarathkumar, who contested on the AIADMK symbol.

In the light of controversy over his attempt to get his son elected to a post in Tirunelveli district unit of the DMK, he was suspended from the party in May 2015. About a year later, he returned to the AIADMK. In February 2017, he again left the AIADMK, protesting against the appointment of T.T.V. Dhinakaran as the party's deputy general secretary.

196,2020/01/06,No possibility of large number applying under CAA in TN: BJP leader,"BJP national spokesperson G.V.L. Narasimha Rao on Sunday said there was no possibility of large numbers of people in Tamil Nadu applying for citizenship under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). He alleged that the DMK was spreading misinformation and creating panic over the issue.

“Most of the people (religious minorities other than Muslims from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh) applying for citizenship under CAA would typically be from northern parts of India. By making comments against CAA, DMK is thinking they are hurting the BJP, but they are hurting themselves,” he told reporters.

Mr. Rao was in Chennai to kick-start the party’s campaign in support of the CAA. The campaign was launched in 40 major locations in the country on Sunday.

He claimed that DMK president M.K. Stalin was increasingly emulating the politics of AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi, which, according to Mr. Rao, was communal propaganda for developing a vote bank.

“Increasingly, the DMK’s tone and tenure seems dedicated to the politics of Owaisi, and it does not look like a party committed to the welfare of Tamils,” Mr. Rao alleged.

He said the Congress was contradicting the statements it had made on the CAA and the National Population Register (NPR) when it was in power.

“Six Hindu refugees from Pakistan were given citizenship in Gujarat and Rajasthan when UPA was in power. DMK was their ally and Dayanidhi Maran and T.R. Baalu were Ministers. Why did they not oppose the move?” Mr. Rao asked.

Mr. Rao also held a meeting with the party’s representatives in Chennai.

“It was a routine meeting regarding various programmes, including the CAA awareness programme. We also took feedback regarding the selection of the State president, and will communicate it to our national leadership,” he said.

Mr. Rao said an announcement on the State president was likely to be made in a few weeks, but did not give a timeframe.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-possibility-of-large-number-applying-under-caa-in-tn-bjp-leader/article30488718.ece
197,2020/01/06,"‘DMK up from 0 to 50, AIADMK down from 100 to 50’","Though the DMK managed to outperform the ruling AIADMK in the rural local body elections in 27 districts, it was unable to penetrate the latter’s traditional strongholds in western and parts of southern Tamil Nadu. However, party treasurer Duraimurugan argues that the results indicate that the DMK will perform well in the 2021 Assembly polls. Excerpts:

Why was the DMK unable to replicate the Lok Sabha poll sweep in the rural local bodies?

During the Lok Sabha polls, the anti-Modi wave was at its peak. After the election, it subsided. That’s why the DMK’s victory margin was narrow in Vellore. In civic polls, local issues dominate the campaign. The ruling AIADMK had almost all the local bodies under its control. After delaying the polls for three years, it finally conducted them amid pressure from the courts. We have increased our tally from zero to 50, while the AIADMK is down from 100 to 50. The results reflect the people’s anger against the government. In panchayats, elections are fought purely on local issues — influence of families, their deities and rivalries. The people have chosen candidates who will be able to rise above these issues and implement welfare measures.

But despite what you describe as the people’s anger, the AIADMK has retained control of western Tamil Nadu…

Two Ministers — P. Thangamani and S.P. Velumani — are from the region. They have money power. We had been leading since morning [on the day of the results], but the trend changed in the evening.

This is explained by what happened in Namakkal (He did not elaborate). We do not know how it happened, and are examining it.

But the DMK continues to remain weak in these areas…

The DMK has always been weak in the west, when compared to the AIADMK.

Did the DMK’s campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act play a role in the polls?

It must have played a role. We are not against the CAA, but only oppose the exclusion of Muslims and Sri Lankan Tamils from its ambit. Since protests have been taking place almost everywhere and people have been participating [in the agitations] in large numbers, it should have made an impact.

Will these results help the DMK in the 2021 Assembly election?

These results are a prelude [to the outcome of the 2021 polls]. The votes we have polled will remain in our favour in the Assembly election.

Has the DMK’s performance enthused the party?

Definitely. Earlier, party members were unwilling to contest the civic polls. But a change in the political climate has brought about more candidates, vying with each other to contest the polls. They want to make hay while the sun shines.

Do you think the government will, in the current circumstances, hold elections to the urban local bodies?

The Centre has not released the dues for the local bodies. If the government does not hold elections, the money will not be disbursed. Hence, I believe the government will conduct the polls.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e9j1mq/article30488713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06DURAIMURUGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-up-from-0-to-50-aiadmk-down-from-100-to-50/article30488714.ece
198,2020/01/06,‘Rural poll results not a prelude to 2021 verdict’,"The AIADMK won less than 50% of the posts in panchayat unions and district panchayats in the elections to rural local bodies in 27 districts. Chief Minister and party co-coordinator Edappadi K. Palaniswami described the results as a reward to his party for the welfare schemes implemented by his government.

However, this is the first time in the last 23 years that a ruling party has bagged fewer seats than the Opposition. But AIADMK deputy coordinator K.P. Munusamy insists this has been a compelling victory for the party. He says the results of the rural elections are not a prelude to the people’s verdict in the 2021 Assembly polls. Excerpts:

How would you describe the results of the rural local body elections as far as the AIADMK is concerned?

The results show a strong victory for us.

But given that the AIADMK has secured less than 50% of the seats in the rural local bodies, can you actually call it a strong victory?

Local body elections involve multiple factors. Besides party affiliation, local issues and the reputation of the candidates also matter. So, the results, as I have said, represent a strong victory for the party.

The AIADMK has been in power in the State since 2011. But still, you have managed to win only around 50% of the seats…

Being in power has its share of challenges. Once a party is in government, it is bound to attract only criticism, because it is in power.

There may be some disappointment and anger among the people. So, I reiterate, securing these many seats despite all these factors is indeed a strong victory.

Do you think the AIADMK’s support for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act influenced the electoral outcome? Anwhar Raajhaa, a senior leader of your party, has said so…

(Sounds agitated) All parties take a stand on various issues. So, it would be natural for the leaders of these political parties to defend the stand taken by the leadership.

Is the AIADMK satisfied with the performance of its allies – the BJP, the PMK and the DMDK?

Why are you worried about us? We will take care of our affairs.

What are the AIADMK’s prospects in the rural local body polls in the 10 remaining districts and the urban local body elections that are expected to be held soon?

Our chances of winning are good.

When will the discussions on the seat-sharing agreement between the AIADMK and its allies for the next phase commence?

Like I said, why are you worried about us? We will handle our affairs.

DMK president M.K. Stalin has described the results as a prelude to the outcome of the 2021 Assembly election. Your view...

Besides the performance of the government, issues that crop up at the time of the polls will influence the voters in any election. The previous election alone will not decide the outcome of future polls. So, in 2021, issues that prevail just before the election will matter.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ir2yhf/article30488707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06ADMKMUNUSAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rural-poll-results-not-a-prelude-to-2021-verdict/article30488708.ece

The Beeman falls in Jamunamarathur village is probably the best kept secret of Tiruvannamalai district. It can be reached from Polur or Vaniyambadi, from where the ascent begins, passing through the Kavalur observatory and Alangayam.

Waterfalls has been the centre of attraction in Jawadhu hills. The season usually begins after the rainy season.

Beeman falls is a nature tourism spot in the region. It is a photographer’s paradise and is also suitable for trekking. The solitude of the hills near the falls makes the overnight stay a good experience. Jamanamarathur is the nearest town located 40 km from Polur.

Generally, the Beeman falls is in a cascade for over 8 months in a year. The tourists are allowed to bathe in the pool beneath the waterfall.

In addition to the falls, Kavalur Observatory, Amirthi Forest, Glass House, Ginjee Fort, Sathanur Dam and the hills themselves are other nearby tourism spots.

200,2020/01/06,DMK has reversed trend of ruling party winning civic polls: Stalin,"The DMK has reversed the trend of the ruling party emerging the victor in the civic polls, party president M.K. Stalin has said.

Unveiling a statue of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi at Saidapet, he said, “We have scored a huge victory in the rural local body elections this time. Usually, it is the ruling party that wins in most places during such elections. When MGR was the Chief Minister, the AIADMK won in a majority of the areas where rural local body polls were held. The DMK succeeded in the polls to municipalities, town panchayats and corporations in several places. But even that has changed, and we have emerged victorious in the rural local body polls too [this time].”

Mr. Stalin said it was unfair for the media to project the situation as though the DMK and the AIADMK had got an equal number of seats. In panchayat unions, the DMK had won 2,100 seats, while the AIADMK had got only 1,781 seats, he noted.

“How is this equal? And again, as far as district councillors were concerned, the DMK’s alliance got 243 seats, and the AIADMK, 214,” he added.

The DMK leader inaugurated a computer training and skill development centre at Saidapet.

201,2020/01/06,Residents of 15 villages oppose Silahalla hydroelectric project,"Residents and farmers from around 15 villages, who fear that they may be affected by the 2,000-MW Silahalla hydroelectric project, voiced their opposition to the project during a meeting organised at Balocola village outside Udhagamandalam town on Sunday.

Representatives from Kanneri Mandhanai, Shree Ram Nagar, Thangadu, Oranalli, Manihatty, Meekery, Balocola, Muthukula, Nunthala, Thulithalai, Appukodu, Puduhatty, Kallakorai, Palada and Muthorai unanimously voiced their opposition to the project.

The leaders from the villages said the livelihoods of more than 2,000 farmers could be affected if the hydroelectric project was implemented.

They also feared that agricultural lands could be submerged and people rendered homeless, if the two dams planned as part of the project are constructed.

According to farmers and residents at the meeting, they were briefed by officials from the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) that the ₹7,000-crore project would involve construction of two dams, one near Kundha and another near Shree Ram Nagar in Kanneri Mandhanai.

The residents were told that the project would involve the construction of tunnels, which they fear could destabilise the slopes on which their villages are located, leading to further landslips and disasters.

Rain havoc

K. Nagarajan, a resident of Shree Ram Nagar, Kanneri Mandhanai, whose seven-acre plot might be flooded, said that this year residents of Kundah witnessed widespread destruction in the form of landslips due to record rains in the region.

“Such heavy rains could spell disaster for people who will be living close to the proposed Silahalla hydro-electric plants,” said Mr. Nagarajan.

204,2020/01/06,Iranian consulate decries Gen Soleimani’s assassination,"The US government’s military action to assassinate General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) and his associates, is an unlawful, illegitimate, inhuman and a terrorist act, contrary to the principles and norms of international law and in clear violation of human rights and international humanitarian law, according to the Consulate General of Islamic Republic of Iran in Hyderabad.

Hollow slogans

A strongly worded statement issued here on Monday by the Consulate said: “Gen. Soleimani was a national and transnational hero and a pioneer in the fight against terrorist and extremist groups, including ISIS in the region. Had it not been for the bravery of Gen. Soleimani and his companions, Syria and Iraq would have fallen into the hands of ISIS long ago. US action to assassinate this brave commander reflects the nation’s hollow slogans and false claims to fight terrorism.”

Martyr Qassem Soleimani was in Iraq on the invitation of the Iraqi government as a top Iranian government official, who was targeted by US military operations on Iraqi soil. In this “criminal act”, the US violated the sovereignty of the independent Iraqi government. This military action, by every measure, is a criminal act of terrorism for which the US government carries responsibility internationally, the statement said.

Provocative acts

Given that martyr Soleimani and his companions have for many years been a symbol of the fight against terrorism, in particular the international terrorist group ISIS; US drone strikes on civilian car carrying Gen. Soleimani and his accompanying delegation at Baghdad International Airport are provocative acts aimed at escalating tensions in the region to rebuild the ISIS terrorist group, and the United States must be prepared to fully accept responsibility for the consequences of this terrorist act.

The United States, by this act, is at war with those who are at the forefront of the fight against terrorism. The US government’s criminal action is a gross violation of the fundamental principles of international law and regulations, in particular the principles set forth in the UN Charter. This action can never be justified through the baseless arguments of US officials such as “legitimate defense” or “pre-emptive action”.

205,2020/01/06,Tandas get a facelift with Palle Pragathi,"Saplings planted by the roadside in the month of August at this tanda located in Kondapur mandal have grown to four or five feet on either side of the road. Recently some officials visited the village and suggested flower plants as well. Three days ago the villagers planted flower saplings in between the earlier plants.

The village looks neat wherever there are cement roads. However, on mud roads some dust and cattle dung are visible. Villagers say that due to huge number of cattle it is becoming difficult to keep the village completely clean. The village has about 300 cattle in about 100 houses.

Though the government has come forward to construct community cattle sheds it has become difficult at many villages to find vacant government lands and at the same time many panchayats are not in a position to purchase lands.

At some places in the village where old houses were dismantled, saplings are grown with an assurance to the plot owners that they can remove the grown-up trees when any construction activity commences. To this extent, a panchayat resolution was passed and handed over to the site owners. This is being taken up to convince house site owners to allow planting of saplings.

Cement benches coated with pink paint were erected on the roadside at several places in the village. However, the drainage system in the village is not properly constructed creating problems. The village has submitted a proposal to lay 1,500 metres of new drainage pipeline in addition to the existing one properly.

“There is water problem in the village and we are dependent on transportation till December-end. From January 1, we are supplying water from a borewell dug in the village,” said V.

206,2020/01/06,Greens see red over proposed slaughterhouse at LMD,"Environmentalists, residents and academicians are opposing the proposed construction of slaughterhouse on the picturesque shores of Lower Manair Dam (LMD) reservoir adjacent to the existing drinking water filter-bed on the outskirts.

They alleged that the proposed slaughterhouse on a sprawling four acres premises of the Satavahana University Pharmacy college would cause pollution and contamination of the freshwater body and also the drinking water filter-bed of Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar.

The Satavahana University authorities stated that some authorities and individuals had visited their pharmaceutical college premises on the shores of LMD reservoir recently and earmarked about four acres of land for the proposed slaughterhouse and pitted poles also. Already, the university land measuring around 45 acres was shrinking with the allocation of sites to various organisations. The fresh proposal to the slaughterhouse would completely damage the serene environment along the shores of the reservoir and also the campus, they stated.

The MCK officials said that they had proposed the slaughterhouse few years ago and allocated budget of around ₹ 4 crore for construction of modern abattoir. However, the final clearance of allocation of land was not done, they said. In the meantime, the university authorities had asked the revenue authorities to conduct a survey of their land for the construction of compound wall around their premises to avoid intrusion and allocation of land to other agencies. The surveyor would visit the site on January 6 for survey of the land and help the university authorities to construct a compound wall, the sources said.

Karimnagar Consumer Council leader N Srinivas said the establishment of a slaughterhouse on the pristine location would spoil the environment with discharge of effluents, filth and foul smell would make it difficult for the adjoining residents including the pharmacy college students, regional sports school, police training college, IT tower and others in the vicinity. Above all, the slaughterhouse would contaminate the water at the filter-bed which would supply drinking water for entire Karimnagar town, he stated.

Residents of Alkapuri colony have appealed to the authorities concerned not to spoil the existing serene atmosphere in their residential area by setting up a slaughterhouse. However, the district revenue authorities have clarified that they had not allocated any land for the slaughterhouse to date. Following the location of water filter-bed, adjoining educational institutions and IT tower and the proposed Manair riverfront, there is no possibility of setting up slaughterhouse on the shores of LMD, they said and added that they would identify some other place away from the town to set up a slaughterhouse.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/i2i69q/article30496817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07MANAIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/greens-see-red-over-proposed-slaughterhouse-at-lmd/article30496818.ece
207,2020/01/06,"Students, citizens protest against JNU attack","Students and citizens staged protests in Hyderabad on Monday condemning the violent attack on students and faculty of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi, on Sunday.

Condemning the violence, University of Hyderabad (UoH) students staged a rally inside the campus on Sunday night itself. Around the same time, a few people gathered at Ambedkar statue on Tank Bund to condemn the attack.

While people continued to express their views on social media platforms, the spate of protests in the city resumed from Monday afternoon. Students from Osmania University (OU), English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU), degree and engineering students, Women Activists’ JAC members and faculty members gathered at OU’s Arts College from 12 p.m to 5 p.m to participate in the protest.

It was followed by protests at Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MANUU) and at Darul Shifa Grounds, Charminar.

Human chain

Holding placards with statements against Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), “fascism”, the protesters at OU called for an end to attacks on university students. They formed a human chain and raised slogans condemning the attack.

Later they held a march till Law College, where they staged a sit-in. Addressing the gathering, a student from EFLU said universities and students were coming under attack as educational institutions teach students how to question, criticise discrimination and injustice. The more the number of educated people, more questions will be raised. Student who did not want to be identified said that the preamble to the Constitution has to be upheld.

A Vijay, State vice-president of Progressive Democratic Students Union (PDSU), said that Left-wing students were attacked as they have been consistently winning elections in JNU and the violence might deter them from participating in elections. Besides, he said student groups were making people aware about the effects of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Voice of students

Former president of MANUU Students Union Ataullah Niazi demanded action against perpetrators of violence on the JNU campus. He said that the government wanted to suppress the voice of students against CAA, NRC, National Population Register (NPR) and fee hike.

At Darul Shifa grounds, though it was a flash protest, more than 400 people, including madrasa students and people from across the city, participated in it. Calls were given to gather in other parts of the city.

Kancha Illaiah condemns

Writer and academic Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd strongly condemned the attack on students and teachers of Jawaharlal Nehru University of Delhi on Sunday, and said this is the first time in history of higher education after Independence that masked forces with lethal weapons entered the campus and beat up teachers and students.

Alleging collusion by university administration, he said this signals a new level of disturbing trend of organised violence with support from authorities.

It is ‘un-Indian’ for a democratically elected national party to encourage its student wing to fight its rivals through such attacks, instead of intellectual means, Mr. Ilaiah said in a press note released here on Monday.

ABVP protest at OU

Members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) staged protest at Osmania University’s Arts College on Monday afternoon demanding peaceful academic environment at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) be restored.

ABVP State leader M. Raghavender alleged that members of the left wing affiliated student groups attacked ABVP members at JNU and condemned the violence.

He said that the left wing student groups disturbed academic environment at the premier university in the past two months, and obstructed students from registering for new semester.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9e1mop/article30496803.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/students-citizens-protest-against-jnu-attack/article30496804.ece
208,2020/01/06,Put on hold municipal poll notification for a day: HC to SEC,"The Telangana High Court on Monday directed the State Election Commission (SEC) to put on hold issuing of the municipal election notification till Tuesday evening.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy passed the interim direction after hearing arguments in a PIL plea over announcement of reservation of wards to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Backward Classes and women. The bench will hear the matter first on Tuesday morning.

While former Advocate General C.V. Mohan Reddy appeared for the Telangana SEC, senior lawyer D. Prakash Reddy argued for the petitioner. The bench instructed both the lawyers to present chronological order of the events connected to the PIL along with the rules governing municipal polls and the election manual.

Earlier in the day, the petitioner’s counsel made a mention about the PIL stating that the SEC was likely to issue election schedule on Tuesday and they had sought deferment of the same. The CJ took up the matter after lunch break. Observing that the SEC and the State government should work in tandem on municipal polls issue, the bench asked whether the election manual was being followed in toto or parts.

Presenting his arguments, D. Prakash Reddy said the SEC had first announced the election schedule on December 23, 2019 and was planning to issue the notification on Tuesday. He said it should be the other way round and the action of the SEC was in violation of sections 195 and 243 of Telangana Municipalities Act-2019. He contended that failure of the government to announce reservation of wards till issuing of election notification was depriving aspirants belonging to SC, ST, BC and women sufficient time to contest.

The bench noted that it would be difficult for a reserved category candidate to secure caste certificate and other papers to complete formalities of filing nominations. Mohan Reddy contended that there was no need for a person to have caste certificate to contest the polls. He or she can file a declaration stating that they belonged to a specific reserved category.

A candidate should know well in advance if his or her ward was reserved to a specific category, be SC, ST, BC or women to prepare for the election, the bench said. “There has to be some certainty. In democracy one should be given sufficient time to contest an election. Running for an election is not a cakewalk,” the bench remarked.

When the SEC counsel, while replying to a query from the bench, said that election notification would be issued on Tuesday, the bench directed the SEC to put it on hold. The bench said the SEC can take a call on the matter after adjudication of the plea by it.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9jjsix/article30497045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07HIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/put-on-hold-municipal-poll-notification-for-a-day-hc-to-sec/article30496614.ece
209,2020/01/06,Body of temple worker fished out,"The body of K Shankar, a contract worker, who drowned in the Godavari during the Teppotsavam (float festival) on Sunday night at Parnashala village in Dummugudem mandal, was fished out by the police with the help of local swimmers on Monday.

Shankar, 27, a contract worker of the famous Ramalayam temple in Parnashala, fell off a small boat after the firecrackers stocked in the boat for fireworks display during Teppotsavam, accidentally exploded.

Two other workers on board the boat had a providential escape after they managed to swim to safety, sources said.

Though the police launched a search operation immediately after the incident on Sunday night, they failed to trace Shankar due to darkness. The police retrieved his body from the river after resuming search operation on Monday morning.

Meanwhile, some agitated relatives of the deceased from Seethanagaram village staged a dharna in Parnashala on Monday afternoon resenting the tragic death of the contract worker during the annual fete held in connection with Mukkoti Ekadasi festival.

They alleged that the organisers of Teppotsavam failed to take proper safety precautions and provide life jackets to the contract workers during the boat ride.

210,2020/01/06,"Officials told to ensure smooth conduct of SSC, Inter exams","The State government has directed the officials of the Education Department to take necessary steps for the successful conduct of the ensuing tenth standard and intermediate examinations.

Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar wanted the officials to make sure that the shortcomings that were witnessed during the previous year did not recur. They should examine the recommendations made by the three-member committee appointed by the government last year and take steps accordingly.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was particular that the examinations this year should be held in a fool-proof manner and steps should be taken accordingly. The intermediate examinations this year are scheduled to be held between March 4 and April 23 with 9.65 lakh students writing them while the SSC examinations will be held between March 19 and April 6 with little over 5 lakh students expected to appear for them.

The Chief Secretary reviewed the arrangements that were being made for the smooth conduct of the examinations with senior officials on Monday. The officials explained about steps like jumbling system related to question papers, allotment of centres, issue of hall tickets and others that had already been initiated.

Mr. Somesh Kumar was particular that adequate training should be provided to the evaluators to avoid the shortcomings that occurred last year so that not a single student suffered. Evaluators should be accordingly sensitized about the methodology and the steps that should be taken so that the system was made effective.

The government on its part proposed to set up an online grievance redressal mechanism for the benefit of students and help desks would be set up in all the districts in the coming days.

211,2020/01/06,Athawale calls for proble into mob attack on JNU students,"Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Ramdas Athawale said police should investigate into the mob attack on the students of JNU in New Delhi on Sunday night which left several students and teachers injured.

Addressing a media conference here on Monday, Mr. Athawale who is also the National President of Republican Party of India (A) said that “Our party demands that those responsible for attacking the JNU students should be arrested”.

Mr. Athawale was here to participate in the All India Working Journalists Association conference and also address a general body meeting of his party. He said that the Citizenship Amendment Act was not against Indian Muslims and it would not discriminate against them.

Misconceptions being created

Muslims who stayed back in India after partition should not have any concerns about the CAA and Modi government was not discriminating Indian Muslims against Hindus or other religious groups but Congress and other Opposition Parties were creating misconceptions among Indian Muslims, he asserted. The Modi government had been implementing several programmes like Ujwala, Awas and Jan Dhan Yojana and it benefited eligible people from all communities — both Hindus and Muslims, he said.

Reiterating that the Republican Party of India was supporting both CAA and NRC, he said if any one had misgivings about the word ‘Muslims’ being not included in the CAA, they could represent to the Union government and the Law and Home ministries would look into it. The CAA mentioned that non-Muslim minorities of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who migrated to India before the notified cut off date to escape persecution in those three countries would be considered for citizenship, he said. A blanket citizenship could not be given to Muslims from those three countries because of security concerns for the country.

He expressed happiness that though the members of Muslim community came out after the incident in Jamia Milia University few days after the CAA was passed in Parliament, there were no community clashes any where.

When asked that many States were opposing NRC which required citizens to submit documentary proof of their citizenship which the poor or those in rural areas might not be able to produce, he said the government was not for driving away people.

RPI (A) to contest in ULB polls

The Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment has demanded that the State governments should give five acres of land to all landless poor irrespective of their caste to eliminate poverty.

Mr. Athawale reviewed implementation of social welfare programmes with State government officers here on Monday. He said State government should provide pucca houses to the slum dwellers. Union government was also focusing on providing pucca houses to the poor along with toilet facility.

He said it was brought to his notice that the SC and OBC students were not getting scholarships on time and said State government should ensure timely release of scholarships. He also assured to release any pending scholarship amount from the Centre.

On the ensuing municipal elections, he said RPI (A) has members from all communities and its party workers were present in every district and town. It hoped to contest municipal elections in alliance with the BJP or it would contest on its own.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pue9zh/article30495493.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07RAMDASATHAWALE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/athawale-calls-for-proble-into-mob-attack-on-jnu-students/article30495494.ece
212,2020/01/06,Adilabad to harvest water running off hill streams,"As the backward Adilabad district has rarely seen development which has been planned to match its requirements and without causing damage to environment, the sanction of new check dams on hill streams across its 18 mandals will only come as a welcome feature.

Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao, who holds the Irrigation portfolio as well, has sanctioned 600 check dams across the State in Phase I of the irrigation development of which 84 will be constructed in this district at a cost of about ₹ 200 crore to supply water to crops in nearly 11,000 acres.

The hilly Adilabad district boasts of umpteen number of hills streams which yield enormous quantities of water that actually go wasted as there are no ‘local’ water harvesting structures. The irrigation potential, or that which is of no use in the district, can be gauged from the fact that the Kadem dam in Nirmal district, which has almost all of its catchment area of 2,590 sq km in Adilabad district has received nearly 30 tmcft of water this monsoon but not even a litre of it was used to irrigate lands in Adilabad.

Improve water table

The check dams will not only retain some quantum of the excess water discharged from concerned streams during monsoon but will improve the ground water level for a longer time in the given area. This will take care of the drinking water needs of the local population.

“These works will be taken up on 4th order and above streams sooner than later so as to benefit farmers in the next season,” hoped Adilabad Irrigation Executive Engineer Sushil Deshpande as his department launched the task of screening the works for early start and issuing tender notification. “More will be taken up in the second phase works later when the government will sanction the remaining 600 check dams across the State,” he added.

Largest structure

The largest of the local water harvesting structures will come up across the Toyaguda stream near Toyaguda in remote Gadiguda mandal. It will irrigate 340 acres of lands in the tribal belt and is estimated to cost ₹ 2.28 crore.

Neredigonda and Boath mandals have been allocated 8 check dams each followed by Gudihatnoor and Narnoor getting 7 each. Farmers in these hilly mandals will be ecstatic on learning of this two-day-old development as they have waited for it for long.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fke4ft/article30495328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY07ADB-CHECKDAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/adilabad-to-harvest-water-running-off-hill-streams/article30495329.ece
213,2020/01/06,Weavers JAC seeks early opening of Kakatiya Mega Textile Park,"The Weavers United Joint Action Committee (WUJAC) has demanded that the State government take steps to open the Kakatiya Mega Textile Park at the earliest and provide employment to local weavers as well as workers migrated from the north Telangana region there.

The WUJAC demanded that the government provide ₹ 5 lakh insurance to cover to all weavers free of cost and ensure provision of ₹ 36,000 as annual investment assistance to Telangana weavers on the lines of neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. The government should take steps to provide plots to weavers for houses as well as setting up worksheds besides providing health cards to them.

JAC chairman Dasu Suresh requested the government to sanction ex-gratia of ₹ 10 lakh each to families of more than 300 weavers who died recently besides taking steps to ensure linking of the domestic handloom market with the international markets. He lamented that suicides by weavers were continuing in Telangana in spite of the promises made by the ruling TRS for mitigating their distress in the run up to the previous elections. The government on its part did not even console the bereaved families which lost their breadwinners.

He demanded that the government take steps to upgrading skills of weavers to withstand competition internationally and exempt handloom raw material from the GST. A Weavers Welfare Trust for the welfare of the community should be constituted if need be by levying 2% cess on the sale of handloom, textile industries as well as business establishments dealing with clothing, he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/weavers-jac-seeks-early-opening-of-kakatiya-mega-textile-park/article30494922.ece

217,2020/01/06,"Now, ‘tongue transplantation’ enters political lexicon","The raging issue of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens in the country has brought out in the open serious differences between political parties and different sections of people.

At a recent meeting with ‘intellectuals’ in Hyderabad, national spokesperson of BJP G.V.L. Narasimha Rao has made an interesting remark about transplantation of some important parts of the human body.

He recollected how former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, as a member of the Congress in Rajya Sabha during the NDA government led by A.B. Vajpayee, spoke in support of citizenship to religious minorities who migrated to India from Pakistan and Bangladesh after persecution back home, and how he is opposing CAA aimed at the same now.

CPI (M) leader Prakash Karat, Mamata Benerjee, Lalu Prasad Yadav and others too had made the same demand. “Their change of stance on the issue makes me suspect that they may have undergone tongue transplantation, although people know only about heart, kidney and liver transplantation more,” Mr. Rao said.

Young IAS officers a happy lot

The recent change in the guard in the State executive has apparently given rise to speculation over the possible changes in top posts of the key departments.

Ever since Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao preferred senior bureaucrat Somesh Kumar as Chief Secretary to head the bureaucracy, the BRKR Bhavan, the seat of state administration, is abuzz with talk on the possible changes, including a reshuffle in the Chief Secretary’s establishment.

The speculation that some officers senior to Mr. Somesh Kumar preferred transfer to independent bodies like that of the office of the Chief Electoral Officer has triggered hopes among the relatively younger IAS officers of getting good portfolios as part of the proposed reshuffle in the coming days.

Poll code plays spoilsport

The release of schedule for municipal elections has cast a shadow on the traditional press conferences of police to release their annual progress report.

Director General of Police M Mahender Reddy, and Police Commissioners of Cyberabad and Rachakonda VC Sajjanar and Mahesh Bhagwat respectively, cancelled the media conference due to election code in force in the State in general and the two commissionerates in particular.

Instead, the top cops invited the journalists for ‘get-together’ and hosted lunches separately in the last week of December, during which the top cops were tight-lipped and did not take any questions on their professional work. However, they exchanged views on topics of general interest.

It was presumed that the three officers will hold the ‘much-awaited’ annual press meet after January 22, when the elections will be completed, as they have already printed books on their work done during the year.

With no election in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation limits, Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar chose to hold the annual press conference at the historic Koti Residency.

The inaugural games, to be held at the KIIT University in Bhubaneswar, will have 17 sports disciplines and feature around 4,000 athletes from around 80 to 100 universities.

The individual events will be in archery, athletics, boxing, fencing, judo, swimming, weightlifting and wrestling. The team events will be in badminton, basketball, football, hockey, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, rugby, and kabaddi.

In the last few years, Odisha has hosted big tournaments such as the 2017 Asian Athletics Championships, 2018 Men’s Hockey World Cup, 2019 Commonwealth Table Tennis Championships, and the Hockey Olympic Qualifiers in November 2019.

Ahead of the launch event on Monday, Odisha’s Minister of Sports and Youth Services, Tusharkanti Behera, said the KIUG would provide a perfect platform for young athletes to gain national recognition.

“It is an event of massive scale involving youth and we expect a seamless and successful execution of the event. We are confident that participants will demonstrate highest level of sportsmanship and return to their states as ambassadors for KIUG and Odisha,” Behera told The Hindu.

The KIUG 2020 will be broadcast on Doordarshan. There are plans to stream key events across the state’s social platforms and YouTube channels. Behera said a dedicated event site would provide schedules, updates, photos and highlights of the games.

221,2020/01/06,Avant-garde posters unveiled as Tokyo Olympics near,"The official posters are out for this year’s Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.

The 20 posters have been created by 19 artists in fields ranging from painting, graphic design and photography. Calligraphy and Japanese manga are also represented. Manga is the Japanese art of comics and cartooning, which is very famous in the host country.

The posters were first put on display on Monday at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo. They will remain on display at the museum in east Tokyo through February 16.

The posters are a tradition at every Olympics and Paralympics, and many previous posters have become collector’s items. The requirement to create posters is set out in the so-called “host city contract” in which the International Olympic Committee establishes the rules for the preparation and management of the games.

The Summer Olympics open at Tokyo’s new National Stadium on July 24 and are followed by the Paralympics on August 25.

Of the 20 posters, 12 are based on OIympic themes and eight were inspired by the Paralympics. Several feature wheelchairs, including a graphic vision of the violence in the sport of wheelchair rugby.

Many of the images are far from traditional, showcasing bright colours and curious forms. In many of the avant-garde images it is difficult to discern the exact tie to the Olympics or Paralympics. Very few even feature a prominent display of the Tokyo Olympic or Paralympic logos.

222,2020/01/06,"In Chennai, this t-shirt celebrates the city’s legendary artistes","If there is a thing called wearable art, there is a whole stock waiting to be bought, and worn at the residence of Chennai-based classical-contemporary dancer, Anita Ratnam. With an intent to share her love for Chennai, a city she says has been so “warm and welcoming to her while simultaneously testing her patience and resolve”, every year during the Margazhi season of music and dance in December and January, Ratnam creates things and experiences as an ode to what she considers is the “greatest festival in the world”.

This time, Ratnam created the beautiful black T-shirt that is a tribute, of sorts, to legendary artistes across all the classical styles who have either passed on or are above the age of 80. “You see, in 2017,” says Anita, taking a break from her rehearsals for her performances of Naachiyar Next across different venues in the city, “I visited Stockholm where they have a small and beautiful Ballet Museum. In the gift shop I saw this lovely T-shirt with first names of the famous dancers of ballet and modern dance. I was immediately struck by the idea of creating something similar for Indian dance. Just the first names of all those early great 20th Century performers who carved the present and future of Indian dance history.”

Doing away — despite initial hesitation — with prefixes and suffixes like ji, didi, akka, that we in India usually use to refer to artistes, Ratnam went ahead with the names of 17 dancers: Balasaraswati, Yamini, Indrani, Chandralekha, Vyjayanthimala, Kelucharan, Vempatti, just to name a few.

“The names,” she says, “were all tested on a small group of dancers and dance rasikas and still I am surprised that so many young millennials know so little about some of the artistes. Kamala, who was the reason that my generation of young girls took to dance... Indrani, who pioneered the international face of Indian dance. I hope that by wearing this T-shirt, this current generation can also get to learn about our dance history.”

The T-shirt is priced at ₹500 and is available at Ratnam’s residence on 10, Cenotaph Road.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/d2oins/article30494354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DANCERANITARATNAM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/in-chennai-a-t-shirt-that-celebrates-the-citys-legendary-artistes/article30494355.ece
223,2020/01/06,Avani Rao Gandra’s art draws attention to the destruction of water bodies,"And quiet flows the Musi. It would have, if we had allowed it to. Hyderabad was built around the river that’s now polluted beyond recognition and reduced to a mess. A river that snakes through a landscape is its lifeline and if it’s injured and depleted, nature has its way of striking back.

A few days ago, artist and curator Avani Rao Gandra presented a public installation as part of Hyderabad Urban Lab’s ‘Do Din’ event, metaphorically equating the dying river Musi to a wounded snake.

Stemming from that thought, Avani now presents another installation titled Death of a River, using sand, matchsticks and coal tar, in the Iconart studio premises. The river again takes the form of a snake that’s wounded, but there’s a lot more at play in this interpretation.

Avani brings in her observations of how the five elements of nature — water, fire, air, space and earth — are revered. Cultural rituals revolve around respecting the elements of nature. The many matchsticks on the snake’s surface are reminders to the fact that they could be sources of light to dispel darkness or when abused, can cause destruction.

‘Flow: Energy, essence, ecstasy of nature’ is Avani’s new series of work and the installation is accompanied by more than 30 paintings on display. For a little more than two years, Avani worked on 60 paintings that leaned towards abstraction, exploring mankind’s connect with water.

Avani talks about the urbanisation Hyderabad has witnessed in the recent decades: “We first built the city around Musi, then Hussain Sagar became the central point and today there’s a lot of urbanisation around Gandipet and other water sources. Water is our lifeline but how much we end up destroying it. We have also reduced rock formations that date back to millions of years into rubble within a short time.”

The installation at Iconart by Avani Rao

Her painting series isn’t all about rummaging about destruction. The colours and patterns are glorious enough to evoke a sense of awe. “The masters of abstract art have spoken about using unusual colours. When I began this series, I thought about art history and the use of colours. But then, for more than 50 years I have been enjoying the beauty of natural colours. I love watching sunrises and sunsets; every few months I move away from Hyderabad to river fronts or waterside destinations to enjoy natural colours and beauty. So I couldn’t help but bring in those colours and forms into my work,” she says.

In some paintings, she uses a mix of blue, grey and white tones while others use flaming oranges and black, and yet another group of paintings use earthy browns and blues. On journeys into the sea, near islands and near the sea rimmed by forests, we would see all these colours in time periods.

Circular, ripple like forms are a recurrent motif in a few paintings. These are Avani’s interpretations of a drop of water falling on the surface of the ocean to cause the circular movements. “I’ve used water drops to bring a sense of calm in some paintings; I’ve also used water drops to show that if we shake the balance even a wee bit more, we will be tearing into nature and causing disruption,” she explains.

Viewing these paintings from a distance at the gallery, some of the abstractions resemble lightning while others resembles mandala forms and the yogic energy flow in the body. Avani agrees she’s brought in her understanding of yoga and meditation to the Flow series.

Flow - paintings and installation will be on view at Iconart gallery, Hyderabad, till January 30",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/px5c6u/article30492719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Avani-rao---flow-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/hyderabads-avani-rao-gandra-draws-attention-to-destruction-of-water-bodies-through-her-paintings-and-installation/article30492720.ece
224,2020/01/06,Working with Rohingya: Art from the heart at Dilli Haat,"Shwettaj Jahan’s stall in Dilli Haat, has a green fan made of bamboo and intricately woven with thread. It looks like a craft from the Northeast of India, but the jewellery designer clarifies that it is the work of a Rohingya refugee. “The girl who worked on this was able to get the desired result as her hands are soft,” she says. Shwettaj, who has in the past gifted a sari to Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, trained a group in design and weaving at a workshop. She helped them make trinkets, bracelets and fans that appeal to an urban audience.

“I am finally showcasing what they make there. We are facing a humanitarian crisis right now. My intent was to provide them with livelihood opportunities. I got funds from the United Nations,” says this young designer, whose grandfather hailed from West Bengal, before they migrated to what is now Bangladesh. Her assistant Mohammad Arhan, though lives in Daryaganj.

This is the 34th edition of the fortnight long Dastkari Haat Crafts Bazaar at Dilli Haat that commenced on Friday. This year, Jaya Jaitly, president of Dastkari Haat Samiti, has invited Bangladesh, carrying on the tradition of showcasing a neighbouring country's craft tradition, in a bid to foster people to people contact.

In focus is the craftsmanship of Nakshi Kantha, a traditional Bengali tradition that involved stitching discarded pieces of cloth and bits of old clothes to make quilts. Some have contemporary geometric patterns, others are traditional. They highlight the flora and fauna and the favourite food of the locals in Dhakka and Chittagong.

“In earlier times, when Bengali women got married they would do Nakshi Kantha on a razai. Even in those days, they were recycling, using torn pieces to make one piece,"" says Veena Sikri, convenor of the South Asia Women’s Network and former professor at Jamia Millia Islamia, who was invited as a guest on the first day, when artisans were introduced. She explains that Kantha is the stitch, while Nakshi refers to the motifs: fish, lotus, elephants and wild flowers. ""In our part (West Bengal), there are more floral patterns, whereas there (Bangladesh) the fish is the dominant motif,” she explains. At Dilli Haat, there are bedsheets, scarves and saris, some with contemporary geometric patterns, others with traditional motifs.

Tahira Begum, a middle-aged artisan shows the contours of the Hilsa on one of the bedsheets. She's measured the distance between each fish using one handspan.

“It's such painstaking work that four artisans have to be involved to complete one bedsheet, with just the leaf motif,” she says, On January 14th, prototypes of bamboo baskets, recycled jewellery, hand bags with Nakshi Kantha — jointly created by Indian and Bangladeshi artisans — will be on display.0

All the artisans from Bangladesh would not have converged to Dilli Haat had it not been for the encouragement and knack for spotting talent of Suraiya Choudhary, coordinator working for 26 years. It is a happy homecoming for Tahira, who visited India twice and after prodding from Jaya Jaitly, agreed to come.

“She mostly works in villages; so it is difficult to get across to her. Finally, I spoke to her,” says Jaya Jaitly.

227,2020/01/06,Jadavpur University on the boil over violence in JNU,"The Jadavpur University [JU] had been on the boil since Monday morning in protest against the violence in the Jawaharlal Nehru University on Sunday.

The situation turned volatile late in the evening when supporters of the BJP and the students came face to face near the university. Around 9 pm, the two groups had a few rounds of scuffles and both sides started a sit-in near the Bagha Jatin crossing, a km south of the university. Prior to the sit in, the police asked both sides to leave but they decided to stay put. The police resorted to lathicharge and members of both sides received minor injuries. The students alleged that women too were beaten up by the police.

Earlier in the day, students took out a huge rally. They walked for close to four hours raising anti-CAA and NRC slogans till they came face to face with a BJP rally, led by Anupam Hazra.

A party candidate in the Lok Sabha, Mr. Hazra alleged that “leftist students went on the rampage at our party office on Sulekha crossing and burnt down the party flag”. While the students set the BJP’s flags on fire in front of the party office in Jadavpur, both the teachers and the students, who participated in the rally, alleged that the BJP had started the fight. “The BJP supporters threw stones and also said we should go to Pakistan which triggered the fight,” a student said.

Rallies were taken out by the students of the Presidency University also. A rally went past the BJP headquarters in Central Avenue. Students belonging to the SFI and the All India Students Association (AISA) also held protests at the College Street area. Students affiliated to Left organisation also took out rallies in Asansol Durgapur area.

228,2020/01/06,"No bandh in Bengal, says Mamata","Two days before the all-India general strike called by Left trade unions, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Monday that there would be no strike in Bengal.

Several trade unions affiliated to the Left parties and Congress had called for a bandh against the economic policies of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP)-led government at the Centre on January 8. Protection of public sector units (PSUs) and increase in minimum wages are included in the demands made by the trade unions. They will also protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Speaking to journalists after an administrative review meeting at Ganga Sagar, the CM said that though she supports the issues, she would not allow any bandh in the State.

‘Poor will suffer’

“There will be no bandh in Bengal. Ever since we came to power, we have not allowed any bandh in the State. What will happen due to the bandh? Thousands of crores will be wasted and the poor will suffer,” she said. Ms. Banerjee said that there were other means to protest and highlight demands, and “not by calling a strike or bandh”.

Earlier in the day, a notification by the West Bengal government had said that “no casual leave for absence either in the first half or in the second half of day or for the whole day or any other leave shall be granted to any employee on the said date”. The notification said that any absence on January 8 will be treated as “dies-non” and no salary would be administered for the said date.

CPI-M ready

Anandi Sahu, Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) leader and State general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), the labour wing of the party, said that any attempt to forcibly foil the strike would be met with resistance.

“There is no difference between the economic policies of the Narendra Modi government and the Mamata Banerjee government and that is why attempts are being made to foil the strike,” Mr. Sahu said. The CITU leader said that that long march organised by Left trade unions last month, from Asansol to Kolkata, was a success, and that he expects the 24-hour strike will have the spontaneous support of the people.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/39g92y/article30416072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAMATABANERJEEPRESSCONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-bandh-in-bengal-says-mamata/article30495646.ece

At least 19 persons died, most of them due to bullet injuries, and over 1,240 arrested across the State in the violence during the protests.

In a memorandum submitted to Uttar Pradesh Governor Anandiben Patel, BSP chief Mayawati also reiterated her demand that a high-level judicial probe be conducted into the violence as well as the police action against protesters.

Ms. Mayawati said a judicial probe would ensure that the culprits behind the violence got punished while the “atrocities” and “excesses” committed by the police and administration, would also be exposed. The police had acted in a “barbaric, vindictive and partisan” manner instead of carrying out their duty with honesty.

Satish Mishra, BSP MP, who handed over the memorandum to the Governor, said innocent persons were being unnecessarily “harassed” and such people should be released immediately and action taken against the guilty police and administrative officials.

The BSP also demanded that the State provide suitable compensation to the kin of those killed in the violence and to the victims of ‘police brutality’.

Blood tests conducted on 1,800 children admitted in the hospital between January and October last year showed that they were suffering from encephalitis, but the government admitted only 500 such cases by “tweaking the records”, he told reporters here.

He alleged that acting at the behest of the government, the doctors there described the illness of the children as acute fever and claimed that around 1,500 children had died there between January and October last year.

Mr. Yadav demanded that a team of doctors headed by a sitting Supreme Court of High Court judge be set up to probe the deaths.

The former Chief Minister said that when his father Mulayam Singh Yadav was in power, the then SP government used to pay a compensation to the next of kin of the victim.

Former State secretary of the CPI(M) Janardan Pati demanded that the Supreme Court use its powers and order a probe on its own to bring out the truth.

A group of activists of the All-India Democratic Students Organisation staged a demonstration in front of the Rama Devi Women’s University. “Stop hooliganism on JNU campus,” said a placard.

Activists of a civil society group with the hashtag OdishaStandsWithJNU, who participated in the protest, also organised a candlelight march at the Master Canteen Square in the evening. They raised slogans against the attack on students and teachers and the damage to property on the JNU campus by masked men.

233,2020/01/06,"JNU alumni in govt must take stand, press Home Minister to act: Digvijaya","Former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and Rajya Sabha member Digvijaya Singh on Monday pointed to “gross intelligence failure” of the police in preventing violence at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU). Besides, he called upon its alumni, including two Ministers at the Centre, to exhort the Home Minister to act.

“JNU has such an alumni of eminent persons,” wrote the Congress leader on Twitter. “Ranging from Prime Ministers, Ministers in the GOI (government of India), Ministers in State governments, Nobel laureate, in the Civil Services, activists in the civil society and Members of Parliament cutting across party lines and other fields of which we are proud.”

Mr. Singh pointed out that Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar were alumni of JNU and asked them to take a stand. “Shouldn’t they all stand together not only to condemn (the violence) on social media but force the Home Minister to take strong action against the ABVP goons? What was Delhi police doing? Couldn’t they have prevented it?”

On Sunday evening, 22 students, including JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh, two teachers and two guards were injured on the campus in an attack by a mob of masked persons wielding rods and sticks. The union has alleged Ms. Ghosh was hit with stones and rods by members of the RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, which has denied the charge.

Terming the incident a “gross intelligence failure”, Mr. Singh said, “What was IB (Intelligence Bureau) or the Intelligence Wing of the Delhi Police doing? Mr. Amit Shah, heads must roll or else we shall hold you responsible for this violence against students of our most prestigious university which has given us leaders of such eminence.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jnu-violence-gross-intelligence-failure-of-police-says-digvijaya-singh/article30492738.ece
234,2020/01/06,SC seeks explanation from Assam on allegations of communal statements by State NRC coordinator,"The Supreme Court on Monday sought an explanation from the Assam government on the allegation that the State coordinator for NRC was making communal statements.

“He should not be saying all this. You (Assam government) have to explain this. Whatever you want. He should not be saying all this,” a Bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde observed after senior advocate Kapil Sibal drew the attention to the alleged statement made by the State NRC coordinator.

The Bench was hearing the petition which also sought removal of the State coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma.

Several other petitions have been filed relating to the NRC in Assam and the Bench issued notices to the Centre and Assam government and sought response within four weeks.

A petition was also heard in which it was stated that around 60 children have been excluded from the NRC but their parents have been granted citizenship through NRC .

Attorney General K.K. Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and the Assam government, said such children will not be separated from their parents.

In the order, the Bench also comprising justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant said children whose parents have been granted citizenship through NRC will not be sent to detention centre.

Mr. Hazra, a former Trinamool Congress MP, has been also booked for allegedly snatching the man’s gold chain following a brawl over clicking selfies with him at a pub on Ho Chi Minh Sarani late on Saturday night, a senior police officer said.

A complaint has been lodged by Suresh Roy, a resident of Kasba area, on Sunday following which police has started an investigation into the incident, the officer said.

In his complaint, Mr. Roy said he met Hazra during a visit to the pub with his girlfriend and friends on Saturday night and had taken selfies with the politician, he said.

“Roy mentioned in the complaint that sometime after taking selfies with Hazra, the BJP leader came up to the complainant and asked him the reason for clicking his photographs. Roy said Hazra then verbally abused him and punched him on the face,” the officer said.

Mr. Roy alleged that after beating him up, Mr. Hazra had molested his girlfriend and also snatched his gold chain.

“We are scrutinising CCTV footage of the pub and are also speaking with its manager and people present there during the incident,” the officer said.

Mr. Hazra, when contacted, dismissed the charges and alleged that the complainant was “fully drunk” when he approached him for a selfie.

“My security guards initially did not allow him (Roy) but when he kept on requesting for a selfie, I told them to let him click it. After taking the selfie, he went to his table. However, one of my security guards saw him taking videos of me from his table and sending them to someone. It was then we complained to the pub manager about it who drove the group away from there,” Mr. Hazra said.

Dismissing the allegations, Mr. Hazra said, “There has been no such incident. Because I am a BJP leader, police has registered such a complaint. No officer has contacted me till now.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-leader-booked-for-beating-up-man-molesting-girlfriend-in-kolkata/article30491663.ece
236,2020/01/06,5 Pakistanis with heroin worth ₹175 cr. nabbed off Gujarat coast,"Five Pakistan nationals carrying heroin worth ₹175 crore were on Monday nabbed from the mid-sea in the Kutch coast by the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) of the Gujarat police, in a joint operation with the Indian Coast Guard (ICG).

The action followed credible inputs on smuggling of a large quantity of drug through the Gujarat coast, sources in the police said.

“We are committed to thwart attempts to smuggle narcotics in state, & well prepared to face any challenge in front of coastal security of 1600 Km long coast. Anti-Terrorist Gujarat, in joint operation with Indian Coast Guard caught 5 Pakistani nationals with Heroin worth ₹175 Cr,” Gujarat DGP Shivanand Jha said on Twitter.

ATS DIG Himanshu Shukla told The Hindu that the smugglers wanted to bring in the drug into the country via the Gujarat coast.

The ATS said in a press release, “Anti-Terrorism Squad, Gujarat, had got credible information that an illegal consignment of narcotic drugs, heroin, was going to be smuggled into Gujarat through coast.” Subsequently, its officers contacted the ICG, and it was decided to launch a joint operation.

The Coast Guard pressed a high-speed interceptor boat into service and a search operation was launched near the location north west of Jakhau, which was indicated in the inputs. A suspicious boat was identified as Pakistan’s Jam-Jam. It was stealthily followed and at the opportune moment, officers and personnel of the ICG and ATS successfully boarded it.

According to ATS officials, a search revealed 35 packets of heroin on the boat. Its approximate weight was 35 kg, valued approximately at ₹175 crore in the international market.

The domes and other marble parts of the mausoleum will undergo scientific conservation, an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) official said. The work is estimated to cost ₹45 lakh.

The structure, known as the ‘Taj of the Deccan’ because of its striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal, was commissioned by Emperor Aurangzeb in 1660 in the memory of his wife Dilras Banu Begum.

Deputy Superintending Archaeologist Shrikant Mishra said its domes and minarets, which are built in marble, as well as the marble screens inside would undergo scientific conservation.

240,2020/01/06,Need transparent UDAN: air passengers’ association,"The Air Passengers Association of India (APAI) wants the Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS) – Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) — to be fine-tuned and recalibrated with details of money spent by the government in airline subsidies, the number of routes suspended. The air passengers’ body said the details must be made public for the sake of transparency.

In his outlook for 2020, APAI president D. Sudhakara Reddy said there was a growing cacophony of claims by airlines about poor bottomlines and other difficulties being faced by them, which are unsubstantiated.

“The irony is that while this high-decibel lobbying is going on, elsewhere in the world, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, most of the airlines are showing profits consecutively for the past 10 years or so. APAI is reiterating its stand that a forensic audit should be carried out by the relevant government agencies on airlines’ balance sheets to know what exactly is happening,” he said.

Mr. Reddy said the government was about to announce the auction for the fourth edition of UDAN to give a push to the scheme while making efforts to privatise six airports to create the desired aviation infrastructure in the country.

“Our considered view is that the achievement of flying 35 lakh passengers under the scheme since its inception augurs well. Yet, to have the desired level of excellence, the scheme will have to be fine-tuned and recalibrated. APAI has been expressing concern that the scheme in the present form is opaque and there is a nagging doubt that airlines are taking advantage of the loopholes, deciding arbitrarily how many seats have to be allocated under the scheme,” he said.

The APAI president said passengers have the right to know how much money has been spent by the government on subsidy to the airlines, how many routes have been suspended by the airlines after launching them, the reasons for this and so on. “Needless to say, such an exercise will make the scheme more transparent and enable objective assessment of the efficacy of UDAN,” he said.

Mr. Reddy said the Airports Authority of India (AAI) has spent over ₹1,100 crore for revamping airports, but still the facilities and operations at these airports remained woefully inadequate. “While the rhetoric is high, traffic levels are low. Viability of the airports has to be established on a sound footing. Airlines are reluctant to include these airports in their network,” Mr. Reddy said.

There are 449 airports in the country including helipads. A majority of the unserved and underserved airports are in this category, the APAI president said. Those with scheduled services, sometimes, see footfalls as few as 7,000, he said.

“There are indications that 75% of the airports owned by it are registering losses, most being regional airports. With the profitable airports being privatised, AAI will soon have a stable revenue stream, which should be deployed towards developing regional airports. Airports development should, therefore, take place concurrently with UDAN to have the desired effect. Indeed, these are some of the challenges that the aviation sector will face in 2020 and beyond,” Mr. Reddy said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/need-transparent-udan-air-passengers-association/article30489240.ece
241,2020/01/06,"BJP would have won had it not gone with Sena, says Rane","Remarking that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) alliance with the Shiv Sena ahead of the Assembly polls was a mistake, former chief minister and the BJP leader Narayan Rane on Sunday targeted his nemesis, Chief Minister and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray, yet again by saying that the new Chief Minister lacked “adequate knowledge” about issues of the State.

Speaking in Solapur, Mr. Rane asserted that the BJP would have swept the Assembly polls had it contested on its own strength.

“We [the BJP] put a lot of trust in the Sena and fought the Assembly elections with them … but this proved to be a mistake. Had we gone it alone, today the BJP would have formed the government in Maharashtra,” Mr. Rane said.

The Konkan strongman, once a Shiv Sainik but now a bitter foe of his former party, said that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government under Mr. Thackeray would not last for more than two months.

“Uddhav Thackeray has no proper knowledge nor has done adequate study of the pressing issues afflicting the State … he is just a nominal Chief Minister,” said Mr. Rane.

Mr. Rane had formally joined the BJP and merged his party, the Maharashtra Swabhiman Paksha, with it in October last year ahead of the elections. In September 2017, he had severed his decade-plus association with the Congress, which he had joined following his acrimonious exit from the Sena.

His exit from the Congress, equally laden with acrimony, was with the expectation that the BJP, which is weak in the Konkan belt, would welcome him with open arms. At the time of his exit, Mr. Rane had vowed to deplete the ranks of his former parties.

Since then, the Konkan strongman has repeatedly targeted the Sena. Ahead of the elections, Mr. Thackeray had warned his then ally, the BJP, that the Sena would exit the saffron coalition if the BJP inducted Mr. Rane.

As a result, the Kankavli Assembly segment in particular and the Konkan belt in general had turned out to be a major flashpoint between the erstwhile saffron allies where the BJP and the Sena, despite contesting together, had propped up their own candidates.

The BJP had fielded Mr. Rane’s son, sitting MLA Nitesh Rane, from Kankavli. An irked Sena had in turn propped up its own nominee, Satish Sawant.

Mr. Rane had fielded his aides, Rajan Teli and Ranjit Desai, against Sena nominees Deepak Kesarkar and Vaibhav Naik for the Sawantwadi and Kudal seats, respectively. However, the BJP could win only two seats in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg belt, including Kankavli.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mswuiy/article30489225.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BMRANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-would-have-won-had-it-not-gone-with-sena-says-rane/article30489226.ece
242,2020/01/06,Pune to host fifth edition of global Drosophila conference,"The city is set to host the fifth edition of the Asia Pacific Drosophila Research Conference (APDRC5), which is being organised in the country for the first time by the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER).

This biennial conference, which is to be held between January 6 and 10, aims to promote the interaction of Drosophila researchers in the Asia-Pacific region with their peers in the rest of the world. It will bring together scientists from all over the world who use the fruit fly, Drosophila, as a model organism to address basic and applied questions.

“Drosophila is one of the most widely-used and preferred model organisms in biological research across the world for the last 100 years. Several discoveries in biology have been made using this. Its genome is entirely sequenced and there is enormous information available about its biochemistry, physiology and behaviour,” said professor (biology) Sutirth Dey of IISER.

The event will feature 430 delegates: 330 Indian and 100 foreign. It will see the participation of two Nobel laureates, professors Eric Wieschaus and Michael Rosbash, known for their seminal contribution to the fields of development biology and chronobiology respectively.

Prof. Wieschaus, an American evolutionary developmental biologist, shared the Nobel in Physiology in 1995 with Edward B. Lewis and Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard for his work on genetic control of embryonic development, while Prof. Rosbash shared the Nobel in 2017 in Physiology along with Michael Young and Jeffrey Hall for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm.

“This event is one of the largest meetings of Drosophila researchers in the whole world and attracts scientists working in diverse disciplines ranging from cell and molecular biology to ecology and evolution,” said Prof. Dey.

Explaining the choice by the APDRC board of IISER to organise the meet, he said the institute is one the premier scientific research institutes of the country and is very strong in Drosophila research, given that there are five professors and 30 Ph.D. scholars who were using Drosophila to answer questions in developmental biology.

A total 57 talks and 240 posters on topics ranging from gametogenesis and stem cells, morphogenesis and mechanobiology, hormones and physiology, cellular and behavioural neurobiology, infection and immunity and ecology and evolution are scheduled for the conference.

“One of the highlights of this conference is that we are explicitly encouraging undergraduates from various institutes of the world to participate in it. There is a pre-conference symposium called ‘signals from the gut’ in collaboration with the National Centre for Cell Science, as well as a pre-conference microscopy workshop on super-resolution microscopy. This will feature microscopes from fluorescence imaging to super resolution imaging (50 nm resolution) which are vital for certain kinds of fly work,” Prof. Dey said.

243,2020/01/06,10 debutants entrusted with portfolios in CM Uddhav Thackeray’s Cabinet,"With 10 first-timers in Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s Cabinet, including himself, the Maha Vikas Aghadi has given a chance to many senior legislators and party loyalists, allocating them important portfolios. The government also has six first-time ministers of State.

The government announced its portfolio distribution on Sunday after it was approved by Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari. The Chief Minister himself is a Cabinet member for the first time, and will hold charge of the General Administration, IT, Information and Public Relations, and Law and Judiciary departments. His son Aaditya, also a first-time legislator, has been allocated the Tourism, Environment and Protocol portfolios.

Despite being newcomers, with a team of Shiv Sena veterans guiding them, the father and son are expected to match up to veterans like Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and former CM Ashok Chavan in Cabinet meetings.

Another first-timer is tribal leader K.C. Padavi, a seven-term MLA from Nandurbar. Despite his seniority, this is the first time the Congress leader has become a minister. Yashomati Thakur is also making her Cabinet debut.

Paithan MLA Sandipan Bhumre, who has been representing the constituency since 1995 (except from 2009-2014), is now Minister for Employment Guarantee and Horticulture. Independent MLA Shankarrao Gadakh from Nevasa had declared support to the Sena, and has been given the Soil and Water Conservation Department. Both are making their debut in the Cabinet.

MLC Anil Parab, who has been a strong presence in the Legislative Council for three terms, has landed a Cabinet berth for the first time.

A lawyer by profession, Mr. Parab successfully pursued the Sena’s plea in Supreme Court after the early morning swearing-in of Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar last year. The SC eventually ordered an immediate floor test and the government fell. Mr. Parab was also responsible for keeping party legislators under his watch at a Madh Island resort during the drama over government formation.

Apart from being a first-timer in the Cabinet, Malad West MLA Aslam Shaikh — representing the constituency for the third time — is the only minority community minister from his party. Karad North MLA Balasaheb Patil is also a newcomer to the Cabinet. The NCP leader is chairman of the Sahyadri Sugar Cooperative factory.

NCP heavyweight Dhananjay Munde, who has steadily risen through the party ranks, has been given charge of the Social Justice and Special Assistance departments. The nephew of former BJP leader Gopinath Munde, the NCP leader defeated his cousin Pankaja in Beed’s Parli constituency this election. He joined NCP in 2013 and played a key role in the MVA government formation.

244,2020/01/06,Sena’s choice of portfolios shows party’s focus on urban areas,"The portfolio distribution of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) announced on Sunday seems to indicate that the Shiv Sena is focusing on urban areas, while the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) will concentrate on rural areas.

The Sena has primarily kept urban portfolios with itself, including the most important Urban Development Department, which controls all municipal corporations in the State. The Sena has allocated it to party heavyweight Eknath Shinde. Similarly, Subhash Desai’s Industries portfolio and Uday Samant’s Higher and Technical Education are departments primarily concerned with urban areas. Mr. Desai held the portfolio in the previous government with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as well, while Higher and Technical Education was with the BJP’s Vinod Tawde.

Although the portfolios given to Aaditya Thackeray — environment and tourism — are neutral, Mr. Thackeray has largely worked in Mumbai so far. The other departments with the Sena are Agriculture, Forests, Water Supply and Sanitation, and Employment Guarantee.

“With the BMC elections coming in 2022, the Sena wants to maintain Mumbai as its stronghold and expand its base as a pan-Maharashtra party through corporations. It has kept Agriculture with itself because of the extensive tours the CM and Aadityaji took across the State before and after elections to assess crop losses. The farm loan waiver was the party’s topmost priority and it has [fulfilled it]. Besides, Forests will compliment the Environment portfolio that is with the Sena,” said a senior party functionary.

While the Rural Development Department is with the NCP’s Hasan Mushrif, Water Resources is with Jayant Patil. In the Congress, Revenue is with Balasaheb Thorat, Tribal Development with K.C. Padavi, and Animal Husbandry with Sunil Kedar.

Several leaders of the right-wing group, including its chief Mohan Bhagwat, were in the city for an internal meeting.

The police registered a case, including against Indore MP Shankar Lalwani, on Saturday night based on complaints of government officials, said Jyoti Umath, City Superintendent of Police, Sanyogitaganj. “Initially a case for disobedience to order promulgated by public servant was registered. Hours later, four more counts were added. No arrests have been made so far,” she said.

While a total of 146 children died in Umaid and MDM hospitals in Jodhpur in December, 102 deaths were reported in the neo-natal intensive care unit.

The figures of infant deaths in Jodhpur were given in a report prepared by the S.N. Medical College in the light of casualties in Kota’s J.K. Lon Hospital.

Over 100 infants have died in the government-run hospital in Kota.

S.N. Medical College principal S.S. Rathore, however, said the figure is in the range of international standards of infant mortality.

“A total of 47,815 children had been admitted to the hospitals in 2019 and of this, 754 children died,” said Dr. Rathore.

In December, 4,689 children had been admitted to the hospitals of which 3,002 had been admitted to NICU and ICU and 146 of them died. Dr. Rathore said most of the children who died were those referred from other surrounding districts in a critical condition.

The hospitals here have to bear the load of patients from entire western Rajasthan and children were also referred from hospitals like AIIMS, he said.

He added the critical care unit of the hospitals have been adjudged best in the State for two consecutive years and attributed it to their best practices and care. Though Dr. Rathore denied any shortage of resources at the hospitals, there have been reports that many senior doctors have been running their own private hospitals.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/over-100-infants-died-in-two-jodhpur-hospitals-report/article30488772.ece
248,2020/01/06,BJP starts door-to-door campaign to garner support for CAA,"In a bid to garner support for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Sunday kicked-off the BJP’s “Sampark Abhiyan” campaign here.

As a part of the campaign, the Chief Minister visited the houses of a few people and informed them about the CAA.

‘Misinformation on Act’

Addressing a gathering, Mr. Khattar hit out at the Congress and other Opposition parties, accusing them of spreading misinformation on CAA.

“The CAA has been passed by Parliament with an aim to provide citizenship to the minorities coming to India from neighbouring countries that are being oppressed there in the name of religion. But a few Opposition parties are misguiding the people of the country by spreading false information without understanding the provisions of the Act,” he said.

He said it is being propagated among the Muslims that it is a law to take away the citizenship of the country from them, whereas in reality, it is to give citizenship.

Flays attack on devotees

Condemning the incident of attack and stone-pelting on Sikh devotees at the historic Gurdwara Nankana Sahib in Pakistan, Mr. Khattar said that protest would be registered, if required, against Pakistan and other countries like Afghanistan and Bangladesh to ensure that the minorities there are not oppressed in the name of religion and their rights are protected.

Minister’s visit

250,2020/01/06,Ensure safety of Indians in Gulf: Amarinder to Centre,"Amid escalating U.S.-Iran tension, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday urged the Central government to take urgent steps to ensure the safety and security of the 10 million Indians in the Gulf region.

India could not afford to simply wait and watch, or to just monitor the situation, given the rising stakes in view of the threats and counter-threats between the U.S. and Iran, said Capt. Amarinder, in the context of the Ministry of External Affairs’ statement that it was keeping a close watch on the situation.

The Chief Minister emphasised that the Indian government should immediately direct their embassies in the region to connect with the Indians settled there, and provide all possible help to them in this hour of crisis.

Pointing out that besides the U.S., other countries like Britain were preparing to evacuate their citizens, if needed, Capt. Amarinder asked the Centre to also prepare and initiate plans to evacuate all Indians seeking to return to India in the current circumstances.

‘Without delay’

The close proximity of the Gulf region to the Indian border made it imperative for the Centre to intervene without delay, and issue the necessary directions to its missions in the West Asian countries, as well as the Indian population there, the Chief Minister stressed.

With the conflict showing no signs of easing, the situation was evidently grave and it would be in the interest of the Indians to leave the Gulf region immediately, he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7k1zty/article30481972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05CAPT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ensure-safety-of-indians-in-gulf-amarinder-to-centre/article30488764.ece
251,2020/01/06,Ranji Trophy | Tamil Nadu picks up three points,"Tamil Nadu took home three points after its gritty show against Uttar Pradesh in the Elite Group-B Ranji Trophy match ended in a draw after an eventful final day at the Green Park Stadium here on Monday.

In the morning, the exciting battle for the first-innings honours went the visitors’ way as left-arm pacer T. Natarajan took the final wicket of skipper Ankit Rajpoot in his third over.

The hosts’ last-wicket pair needed to score just 11 to go past Tamil Nadu’s 180, but managed just five and conceded a five-run lead.

Disastrous start

Tamil Nadu began its second essay on a disastrous note, losing openers Ganga Sridhar Raju and L. Suryapprakash with just three runs on the board.

But B. Aparajith (53, 130b, 6x4) steadied the ship, building two crucial partnerships, first with Kaushik Gandhi and then with the skipper Vijay Shankar for the third and fourth wickets.

The youngster displayed immense patience, handling the UP bowlers with aplomb on a last-day pitch that wasn’t easy to bat on.

Once Aparajith departed, caught behind by Upendra off pacer Rajpoot, the rest collapsed like a pack of cards, and the team was bundled out for 154.

Saurabh bags five again

Left-arm spinner Saurabh Kumar finished with his second five-for, and a match-haul of 10 for 83, to throw open the contest.

UP, sniffing a chance, went for it — 160 in 33 overs — as it had players like Rinku Singh and Mohd. Saif in its ranks.

The former, who opened the innings along with Almas Shaukat, made his intentions clear as he took 10 off left-arm spinner Sai Kishore who was given the new ball.

Rinku continued to be aggressive before Natarajan removed him and Saif off successive deliveries.

The fans kept rooting for UP before the umpires decided to call off the contest due to fading light.

252,2020/01/06,Kapil Dev turns 61,"Legendary cricketer and India’s first World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev turned 61 on Monday and wishes for the former all-rounder poured in on various social media platforms. Kapil had led India to its maiden World Cup title in 1983.

Not only the cricket fraternity, but also wishes from personalities of other walks of life came in for the legend.

“Wishing you a day filled with happiness and a life filled with joy. A very happy birthday @therealkapildev Paaji,” former batsman V.V.S. Laxman tweeted.

Wishing Kapil, Mohammad Kaif also thanked the former cricketer for being a role model for the younger generation. “Many more happy returns of the day @therealkapildev Paaji. Thank you for inspiring a whole generation of youngsters,” Kaif tweeted.

“Wishing Team India’s greatest all-rounder and 1983 World Cup winning Captain Kapil Dev a very happy birthday,” the BCCI tweeted.

“Happy Birthday to one of the legends of Indian cricket @therealkapildev Sir. Have a blessed year ahead,” India opener Shikhar Dhawan tweeted.

Kapil’s former teammate and legendary spinner Bishan Singh Bedi said: “Birthday Greetings for the greatest Indian all rounder till date..God Bless Kaps now & Always..Love All Always.!“

Congress leader and Member of Parliament (MP) Shashi Tharoor was also not behind and wrote: “An absolute great. And gave us all so much pleasure whenever he played.

253,2020/01/06,South Africa mount rear-guard to save Test after Sibley-Stokes show,"Dom Sibley scored a maiden century to put England on top but South Africa have launched a rear-guard to keep the tourists' victory charge at bay after going to the close of the fourth day of the second Test on 126 for two on Monday.

South Africa have been set 438 for victory at Newlands and will have to score a further 312 runs in 90 overs on the final day to achieve the highest run chase in Test cricket history.

It is much more likely, however, they will have to bat out the final three sessions to save the Test.

Debutant opener Pieter Malan is unbeaten on 63 and is at the crease with nightwatchman Keshav Maharaj (2 not out) on a wicket that has flattened considerably for the seamers, but is offering turn to the slow bowlers.

Dean Elgar (34) and Zubayr Hamza (18) are the two players out, the latter in the penultimate over of the day when he edged James Anderson to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.

South Africa famously scored 438 to beat Australia in a one-day international at the Wanderers in 2006 in which current coach Mark Boucher hit the winning runs.

But this would represent an even bigger achievement for a side that has lost many of its batting greats to retirement in recent years.

The current highest success run chase in Tests was 418 by West Indies against Australia in 2003.

England set the stiff target after declaring their second innings on 391 for eight just after lunch, with opener Sibley unbeaten on a patient 133 to go with an explosive 72 from Ben Stokes.

Sibley's hundred was met by an almighty roar from the sizeable travelling English support, even if it took him 269 balls to get there.

Stokes was providing plenty of entertainment at the other end as he took on the task of providing the quick runs England wanted to build a big enough lead and still have enough time to bowl South Africa out a second time.

He smashed seven fours and three sixes in a 47-ball innings of 72, before being caught at mid-on by Rassie van der Dussen off spinner Keshav Maharaj.

His blitz propelled England to 157 runs in 27 overs in the morning session and crucially sped up the game in their pursuit of victory.

254,2020/01/06,"I am different person in terms of how I think about the game, says Rohit Sharma","Rohit Sharma is in a “great space” in his life.

India’s white-ball vice-captain enjoyed a phenomenal 2019 in which he scored a record 2,442 runs as an opener across three formats and more importantly took up the challenge of being a Test opener with stupendous success.

“I am a different Rohit in terms of how I think. I am in such a great space in my life because of the family that I have — my wife (Ritika) and daughter (Samaira). I am not worried about what others are talking,” Rohit told PTI in an exclusive interview looking back at the 12 eventful years of his career in international cricket.

For someone, who has received bouquets and brickbats in equal measure, the 32-year-old is no longer bothered by criticism.

“They (wife and daughter) fill me with love and happiness and I try to stay within that rather than thinking about X, Y or Z making comments about me,” he said.

“I have actually passed that age to react to someone talking good or bad things about me. Frankly speaking, it doesn’t matter any more.”

A double century on his “debut series” as Test opener against South Africa gave India the kind of momentum they were desperately looking for after Virender Sehwag’s exit from the scene.

But ask Rohit about it and he says, “Honestly speaking, I stopped thinking about Test matches long time back.”

And the obvious question is why?

“Earlier, I was thinking too much about success in Tests. I would go overboard as to why is this happening, why am I playing that shot. After each Test innings, I would go to our video analyst, sit, watch and then confuse (clutter) my brain further. That wasn’t actually the right thing that I was doing,” recalled one of India’s greatest white ball players.

“Thinking too much about technique was not allowing me to enjoy the game. All that was there in my mind was ‘Oh I need to do well in Test cricket’ So, before 2018-19 Australia series, I told myself ‘Boss whatever has to happen will happen and I am not going to think about technique’

“At the end of the day, I want to go out there, share a laugh with my mates and enjoy,” the stylish Mumbaikar revealed.

Many thought that the South Africa series was his last shot at redemption as a Test cricketer but not the man himself.

“If you talk about opening in the SA series, from people’s perspective, it was my last chance but I am a sportsman and I can’t think like that. If I thought it was my last chance then I wouldn’t have scored runs with that mindset.

“You can’t allow negative thoughts to creep in when you are playing such a high profile sport,” he said.

But at the same time, he is realistic enough to admit that he had to grab the opportunity that came his way.

“I know that I am no longer 22 or 23 years old that I will keep getting opportunities in Test matches and can take my place for granted. I know that every time I go out there, I have to put a high price tag on my wicket. I am blessed to get an opportunity that many are waiting for. So, why should I regret worry or think about so many things?”

For Rohit, the success in recent years is because of a shield that he has been able to build around himself to “shut the noise down”.

“When you play the sport, there is a lot of distraction and noise around you. You need to create an environment around yourself so that none of this bothers you. No idea, vision or sermons will come inside that shield unless you allow it. Let people say good things, bad things, one shouldn’t be bothered about it.”

He empathises with the young Rishabh Pant, who has been hounded by the critics for inconsistency.

“In fact, I was telling Pant the same thing. Poor guy is only 21 (22) and people are telling him to score hundreds in every game, do this and do that. I mean cut some slack man. I told Rishabh ‘Create a wall and ensure that nobody comes inside. It’s your safe-house. People want to talk about you, let them do it outside that wall and you do what you intend to do inside your zone’

“Who knows it might help Rishabh. It worked for me at least.”

After the ICC World Cup, there were stories about senior players extending their families’ stay beyond the designated number of days and Rohit said he felt hurt at families being dragged into it.

“Our families are there to support us, make us feel happy. When all these things were being written about, few of my friends came and told me and believe me or not, I was just laughing.

“But then it went on and on and they dragged my family and that was not on. You talk about me but don’t drag my family as they genuinely don’t care about anything else. I think even Virat (Kohli) must have felt the same way as families are an important aspect of our lives.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/off4if/article30495906.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ROHITSHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i-am-different-person-in-terms-of-how-i-think-about-the-game-says-rohit-sharma/article30495907.ece

256,2020/01/06,"Sandip Patil on Tara, his adopted leopard","Sandeep Patil developed a fascination for wildlife when watching Tarzan movies as a child. “Baba (Father) would take me to the Shree Talkies (in Dadar, Mumbai) and I would look forward to watching the animals, understanding their behaviour,” he says. Like most kids his age, he also wanted to be Tarzan, pretend-playing he was, in the neighbourhood he grew up in. “I treated the dogs in the area as tigers and lions and gave them names too.”

From the movies, he developed what he calls a “silent relationship and friendship” with animals. Silent, because soon cricket took over his life, and he grew into one of the finest stroke-players, having the distinction of being a member of the 1983 team which won the World Cup for India.

Many years later, when he retired from active cricket and took to coaching, he worked in Kenya for 10 years. He found time here to rekindle his love for animals, especially cats of all kinds.

When he returned to India, Patil was appointed director of the National Cricket Academy at Bengaluru and his weekends were once again filled with wildlife trips to Kabini, Nagarhole, Bannerghatta. “My journalist friend Joseph Hoover accompanied me since he is an active wildlife activist,” he says, adding that they organise an annual cricket tournament called the Tiger Cup for under-16 players, to raise money. “From the fund we award the best wild life guide and officer,” he says.

Patil with Tara | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

His interest in wild life has now helped him engage with the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), situated partly in Mumbai and Thane, and occupying as much as 20% of Maharashtra’s geographical area. Here, he has adopted a leopard, Tara. “I was asked by Vikas Kharge (the Maharashtra Forest Secretary) and Sunil Limaye (a friend) to help in this cause.” He’s roped in players like Harbhajan Singh, Prashant Vaidya and Chandrakant Pandit to also adopt animals. “I also received assurances from Ajinkya Rahane and Sachin Tendulkar,” he says.

Citizens are encouraged to adopt animals at the SGNP, which is spread over an area of 103 km. The cost of adoption is 1.2 lakh per year. “I love my trips to the SGNP where Anwar Ahmed, the chief field officer, enlightens us on wild life. There is a leopard rescue team which saves the animal when they stray into societies close by.”

Back in Kenya, cricketers joke that animals wait to catch a glimpse of Patil. “Of course,” he says, laughing. “I made 24 trips to the Masai Mara. The animals there know me.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/6r3xgr/article30495395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/b0b099db-c26f-42c7-bf94-b691935e4833,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/former-cricketer-sandip-patil-on-his-adopted-leopard/article30495397.ece
257,2020/01/06,Ind vs SL | India looks to solve the combination puzzle,"The first T20I between India and Sri Lanka at Guwahati was poised to throw some light on India’s team combination puzzle, but heavy rain ensured that clarity was not readily provided.

However, the wait for answers will be short as the sides resume battle in the second T20I, at the Holkar Stadium here on Tuesday. For opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan, the abandoned game at Guwahati robbed him of a chance to increase his stock.

Dhawan will be keen

Dhawan, whose spot could be under threat once Rohit Sharma returns well rested, will be desperate to stake his claim with a big knock.

His partner K.L. Rahul is ahead in the race, having struck three fifties and a century in the limited-overs series against the West Indies last month.

Rahul must have fond memories of this venue, where he smashed a 49-ball 89 in the first-ever T20I held here, in December 2017. On the day, Rahul and Rohit racked up a 165-run opening stand to put the Sri Lankans to the sword.

Manish’s role?

Manish Pandey, meanwhile, found himself relegated to the bench, yet again, at Guwahati. The versatile middle-order batsman was part of the squad in the previous two bilateral T20I series (versus Bangladesh and West Indies), but made just one appearance in the playing eleven.

It is not as if there is a settled batting line-up in place, with the likes of Shivam Dube, Shreyas Iyer and Rishabh Pant given chances up the order to support skipper Virat Kohli.

Manish must consider himself unlucky, especially after his recent run-scoring exploits for Karnataka in the Syed Mushtaq Ali and Vijay Hazare tournaments. Does the team management have Manish in their plans for the ICC T20 World Cup later this year?

Importance of Bumrah

There is, however, no doubting the importance of Jasprit Bumrah in the Indian set up. Guwahati missed the chance, giving Indore the first look at Bumrah’s much-anticipated return to action.

The pace sensation is expected to be at full tilt, after a frustrating four month layoff owing to a back stress fracture.

The Sri Lankans have a returning star as well in Angelo Mathews, though his welcome was not quite as affectionate. Mathews, who last played a T20I in August 2018, was left out of the eleven at Guwahati.

On the eve of the series, captain Lasith Malinga had described Mathews as the team’s ‘finisher’, but it was another all-rounder Dasun Shanaka who got the nod. Malinga and his men have to be on point to challenge the Indians, who have dominated the head-to-head records in recent years.

India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), Shikhar Dhawan, K.L. Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Navdeep Saini, Shardul Thakur, Manish Pandey, Washington Sundar and Sanju Samson.

258,2020/01/06,ICC to discuss four-day Test proposal in March despite growing criticism,"The ICC’s cricket committee is set to discuss the four-day Test proposal in March despite growing criticism from the world’s leading players including India skipper Virat Kohli.

Former India captain Anil Kumble, who heads the cricket committee of the sport’s governing body, said the proposal will be discussed in the next round of the ICC meetings, to held in Dubai from March 27-31.

“Since I am part of the committee, I can’t tell what I am thinking about it (proposal) at the moment. We will discuss it in the meeting and let you know,” Kumble told PTI, adding that he is fine with past and current cricketers have expressed their views about four-day Tests.

The likes of Andrew Strauss, Rahul Dravid, Mahela Jayawardene and Shaun Pollock are also on the cricket committee.

The proposal, which has been floated for the 2023-2031 cycle, has not gone down well with the greats of the game including Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting.

However, member boards from England and Australia are open to the idea while BCCI boss Sourav Ganguly has said that “it is too early” to talk about it.

Ahead of the three-match T20 series opener against Sri Lanka in Guwahati last week, Kohli made his stance very clear on the subject.

“According to me, it should not be altered. As I said, the day-night is another step towards commercialising Test cricket and you know, creating excitement around it, but it can’t be tinkered with too much,” he had said.

“Then you are purely only talking about getting numbers, entertainment and you know. I think the intent will not be right then because then you will speak of three-day Tests. I mean where do you end. Then you will speak of Test cricket disappearing. So I don’t endorse that at all.”

Leading Australia spinner Nathan Lyon has termed the idea “ridiculous”.

More recently, Australian great Ponting expressed his disapproval of four-day Tests.

“I understand there is a commercial side to it, saving money and things like that and how they would start on a Thursday to finish on Sunday.

“I’d like to hear the other reasons behind it. I don’t understand it enough and I’m very much a traditionalist, so if something’s not really badly broken then why do we need to fix it or change it?” Ponting was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.

Among former players who want to see four-day Tests are Shane Warne, Mark Taylor and Michael Vaughan.

The ICC wants to try out four-day Tests primarily to free up space in the crowded calendar and use that time for the commercially lucrative shorter formats.

It is not a new phenomenon. England and Ireland played a four-day Test last year. South Africa and Zimbabwe too played one in 2017.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jo03u/article30434794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANILKUMBLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-to-discuss-four-day-test-proposal-in-march-despite-growing-criticism/article30494101.ece

The hosts were utterly ruthless with bat and ball throughout the series and dismissed New Zealand for 136 having declared on 217 for two after lunch to hand the Black Caps an unlikely victory target of 416.

New Zealand had arrived with some confidence they could repeat the singular feat of the triumphant 198586 tourists from across the Tasman Sea but will return well beaten after injury and illness ravaged the squad.

With captain Kane Williamson and batsman Henry Nicholls missing because of a flu bug, New Zealand had no answer to the fearsome pace of Australia's quicks and the guile of Lyon's spin.

Lyon, aided by paceman Mitchell Starc's 3-25, cleaned up the tail on a deteriorating pitch to finish with 5-50 to add to his 5-68 in the first innings.

After New Zealand had slumped to 22-4, Colin de Grandhomme scored a gritty 52 and BJ Watling 19 off 108 balls and at one stage it looked like a fifth day might be needed for the first time in the series.

But with Matt Henry unable to bat because of a broken thumb sustained earlier in the match Lyon ended the resistance under the SCG lights when he had Watling caught by Pat Cummins.

“It's a great summer for the Australian test side and it's very special to be part of it, to win tests at home and be very clinical in all wins, very impressive,” off-spinner Lyon said. “To take 10 on my home deck in front of friends and family is pretty special but every chance you get to put the Baggy Green on is for me a dream come true.”

Ross Taylor scored 22 runs for the tourists to take his career tally to 7,174 and overhaul Stephen Fleming as New Zealand's highest test scorer. It was a rare glimmer of light for the visitors and five balls after passing that milestone Taylor had his off stump removed by a peach of a delivery from Cummins, the world's top ranked test bowler.

“We were outplayed in all departments,” said Williamson. “We were good with the ball in hand but with the bat we couldn't be good for long enough ... Frustrating and disappointing coming here after playing some good cricket for a long period of time.”

Prolific batting

Earlier, David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne had produced more of the prolific batting that has helped carry Australia to five thumping victories in five tests against Pakistan and New Zealand in their home summer.

Warner secured his 24th test century with an exhibition of batting on his home ground for 111 not out as the hosts looked to quickly inflate the lead of 263 with which they started the day.

The opener, born a few hundred metres from the SCG, hit 154 and 335 not out against Pakistan in the first two tests of Australia's home season but had failed to get past the half-century mark in five innings in the New Zealand series.

The left-hander looked unlikely to repeat those failures on Monday after resuming on 23 with Australia 40 without loss and he reached the milestone with three runs through mid-wicket off 147 deliveries.

Three balls later Labuschagne, who had joined Warner after Joe Burns was caught and bowled by Todd Astle for 40, passed the half-century mark for the seventh time in Australia's five home tests this year.

Australia captain Tim Paine declared after Labuschagne, who scored a maiden double century in the home side's first-innings 454, was caught at long for 59.

Warner finishes Australia's five home tests with 786 runs at an average of 131, while Labuschagne's glorious summer ended with a tally of 896 runs at 112 and both man of the match and man of the series honours.

“I'm very lucky no doubt to be captaining this group, it's a special team,” said Paine. “Batting has become very consistent with Marnus leading this year and Steve (Smith) and David back ... it's pretty simple leading this side at times.”

Labuschagne was handed a rare penalty by umpire Aleem Dar for running on the wicket but it never looked like the extra five runs being added to New Zealand's first innings score of 251 would make a difference to the outcome.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/3y54v3/article30492578.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIANEWZEALANDCRICKET-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/lyon-roars-as-australia-crush-new-zealand-to-sweep-series/article30492583.ece
260,2020/01/06,Ross Taylor becomes New Zealand's top test run scorer,"Ross Taylor became New Zealand's highest run-scorer in the longest form of the game on Monday when he hit three runs through mid-on after tea on the fourth day of the third test against Australia.

The 35-year-old, playing in his 99th test, overhauled the tally of 7,172 Stephen Fleming managed in 111 matches between 1994 and 2008.

Any joy the former New Zealand captain felt at passing the milestone was short-lived as he was bowled for 22 by paceman Pat Cummins five balls later.

262,2020/01/06,"Asked to get milk, father smashes child’s head against a wall","His tiny body smashed repeatedly against the wall by his father, 17-month-old Vishnu* is now breathing attached to a ventilator and fighting for his life, after this second assault in less than 15 days.

The child has been in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) trauma centre for the past seven days, and was brought unconscious to the hospital on the night of December 28. The incident occured after Vishnu’s mother asked his father to get milk for the child.

“The child had suffered extensive head injuries and was not conscious when he was brought to us. He has been brutally assaulted, and in case he survives, there are chances of life-long medical complications. The child is also anaemic and malnourished. We are trying our best to ensure that he gets the best medical care possible,” said Dr. Deepak Gupta, Professor-Neurosurgery. Vishnu is currently under his care.

Frequently abusive

Standing outside the ICU on the third floor of the AIIMS Trauma Centre on Monday, Vishnu’s mother, 25-year-old Asha*, says her husband, a daily wage earner, is addicted to drugs and frequently abusive at home.

“That night, I asked him to bring some milk for Vishnu and some rice for my two girls. He lost his temper, picked up the boy and smashed him repeatedly against the wall. I snatched him after his father hit him thrice against the wall and ran out. My son’s face was covered in blood and his body went limp. I feared the worst. A passer-by helped us reach the hospital,” said Ms. Asha.

Without any source of income — she begs at Nehru Place to feed her children — Ms. Asha is worried about how she will take care of her son after he is discharged.

“This is the second time he has assaulted the child in less than 15 days. Earlier, he picked up the child and dropped him on the floor. I am scared what will happen when it’s time to go home,’’ she said, adding that she was not sure of the father’s whereabouts at the moment.

“My mother-in-law called me to say that we should not come home as her son is waiting to kill me too,” she said.

Sister prays

Meanwhile, standing alongside her mother, Vishnu’s 6-year-old sister said: “My brother is inside the big room in the hospital. After he gets better, we will go home. I am praying for him everyday. Today, we will light a candle and pray for him.’’

The sister, too, said it was her father who had assaulted Vishnu. “Papa beat him up and smashed him against the wall,” she said, adding, “But now he will be fine. We are with good people here.”

Oblivious to their distress, Vishnu is struggling to breathe without assistance. “We cannot say how the case is going to progress. The child is very ill,” said a senior doctor looking after Vishnu.

263,2020/01/06,"Delhi polls on Feb. 8, counting of votes on Feb. 11","Elections to the 70-member Delhi Legislative Assembly would be held on February 8 and the votes counted on February 11, the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced on Monday.

At a press conference at the ECI headquarters here, Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora (CEC) said the poll notification would be issued on January 14. The last date for filing of nominations is January 21, their scrutiny on January 22 and the last date for withdrawal of candidature is January 24.

Mr. Arora said 1,47,03,692 electors – 1,46,92,136 general category and 11,556 service voters – were eligible to vote in the polls to be held at 13,750 polling stations.

Mr. Arora said ECI officials and the Commission itself had held meetings with officials of the Delhi Police, the Delhi government and the Ministry of Home Affairs. Asked about the prevailing law and order situation, with protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and violence breaking out, he said: “We are hopeful that they will be able to control the situation”. If an “extraordinary situation” arose in the polling process, the ECI had the option of deferring elections.

Mr. Arora said the Model Code of Conduct had come into effect as he was speaking at the press conference. With the Union Budget usually tabled in Parliament on February 1, Mr. Arora said a 2017 ruling of the ECI regarding state-specific announcements would apply. “No state-specific schemes” or “achievements” can be announced in the Budget.

Like in the recently held Jharkhand Assembly elections, where a pilot was carried out in seven constituencies, postal ballot facilities would be provided to persons with disabilities and senior citizens over the age of 80 in select constituencies in Delhi as well, he said, adding that one seat each in the 11 districts would be chosen.

On voter turnout, he said: “Ironically, the turnout in Left-wing extremism-affected areas in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh has been far more than some of the toniest constituencies of Delhi”.

The term of the existing Delhi Assembly expires on February 22. The Aam Aadmi Party had swept the 2015 elections, winning 67 out of the 70 seats.

“There were repeated rounds of violence in Sabarmati going on from 7 to 8 p.m.” but none of the wardens was available or those present were too traumatised to react, the students wrote.

As it happened: Masked goons strike terror in JNU, none arrested

Detailing the events, the letter states that a mob of about 70-80 people wielding iron rods and bricks charged towards the hostel around 7.00 p.m. The security guards present at the site failed to call for additional security or take any action, it adds.

Following this, “The gate was smashed by masked ABVP goons,” many of whom entered the boys’ wing, while others entered the women’s wing, the letter states.

The boys’ wing was vandalised by the mob and several students were badly beaten up, with “violent noises” coming from the mess and the boys’ wing, the residents alleged. During the attack, residents of Sabarmati who were ABVP members cheered on the hostel WhatsApp group and encouraged the violence, the letter claims.

In all this, multiple wardens who residents reached out to had either fled the scene, locked themselves inside their room in fear or refused to offer help, the students wrote. Additionally, security guards here had also abandoned their posts.

“The hostel administration was categorically informed regarding the unbecoming conduct of ABVP students...had been creating an unsafe environment in the campus and hostel,” the letter by residents states. They alleged that following an attack by Rithwik Raj, a resident of the hostel on Saturday, additional security was requested as the guards present had allegedly left their posts vacant between 3 p.m. and 7.45 p.m. But the appeal was not heeded, they said.

Residents demanded that all culprits involved must be suspended and “the harshest punishment” be imposed.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wsu390/article30492677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THLTJNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/security-guards-failed-to-act-during-violence-allege-residents-of-jnu-hostel/article30492678.ece

However, Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar — who is facing calls for resignation from the university’s students union — skipped the meeting.

MHRD Secretary Amit Khare held the meeting with a team of the JNU authorities including Pro-Vice-Chancellor Chintamani Mahapatra, Registrar Promod Kumar, Rector Rana Pratap Singh and Proctor Dhananjay Singh. In the two-hour meeting, he was briefed about the situation in the wake of the violence and the university’s efforts to restore normalcy. The Secretary, who was in Bhopal, had rushed back to Delhi on Sunday night.

HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank was in Dehradun on Sunday and Bhubaneswar on Monday. He told reporters there that educational institutions “cannot be allowed to become political addas [hubs]”. “Strong action will be initiated against people involved in such an attack,” he said.

The JNU Vice-Chancellor had also not been willing to meet the committee appointed by the Ministry to resolve the stand-off between students and administration last month, despite repeated attempts.

266,2020/01/06,JNU violence: Students’ union demands V-C’s resignation,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU) on Monday demanded the immediate resignation or sacking of JNU Vice-Chancellor M. Jagdeesh Kumar for the brutal attack by armed and masked goons on the university campus on Sunday night.

As condemnation of the incident continued to come in from civil society groups and individuals, the Delhi Police said an FIR had been registered against “unknown persons” for rioting and damage to property.

As it happened: Masked goons strike terror in JNU, none arrested

The JNUSU and a number of faculty members have accused the Delhi police of being bystanders to the violence and allowing the masked attackers to leave the campus premises after going on the rampage for several hours on Sunday night.

“The violence that happened is the result of the desperation and frustration of the V-C and his cronies. But the chronology of events that unfolded today [Sunday] is a shameful episode for the Delhi Police who gave a safe passage to ABVP goons imported from outside. For days now the administration has been unable to break our protest. Since 4th January, ABVP people were directed as henchmen of the V-C to come and beat up students. They used lathis and pipes on that day,” the JNUSU alleged in a statement.

In a separate development, the JNU Teachers Association said in an open letter to President Ram Nath Kovind, “The JNUTA with full sense of responsibility accuses the JNU Administration headed by the Vice- Chancellor of being responsible for the orgy of violence in JNU…It is evident that without the connivance of the Administration, the entry into the campus of several of the goons who were not from the campus, and their subsequent exit without being caught, would not have been possible.”

“There are also reports from different eyewitnesses that members of the JNU Administration helped some such people in gaining entry and then provided shelter to them in their residences on campus. The absence of any action for several hours by the Security or the Police to stop the violence, despite being informed of it, also reveals the complicity of the Administration in the violence…After all of this, the JNU Administration’s description in its press note of the events of yesterday, in which the sole culprits are the students agitating against the hike, lets the cat out of the bag. It flies in the face of all the evidence the whole world has seen and in doing so reveals the dishonest purposes behind the statement - namely, of shielding those who made up the mob and attacked students and teachers,” the JNUTA statement said.

Professor Jayati Ghosh, who teaches at JNU, said in a tweet, “Police were not “helpless”, they were complicit. They stood and watched the violence, prevented bleeding victims in ambulances from leaving the gate, and after 3 hours of mayhem, escorted the goons safely out of campus…”

V-C unrelenting

The V-C, however, showed no signs of relenting from his stand and claimed in a statement that “the origin of the present situation” lay on certain agitating students “turning violent” and obstructing academic activities of other students. “No such person will be spared and appropriate action taken,” Dr. Kumar warned.

34 discharged

Thirty-four persons, injured in the violence that broken out at JNU campus, who were brought to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Sunday night, were discharged after treatment. One teacher was taken to Safdarjung Hospital and later discharged said an official here.

“Several students had broken limbs and head injuries. They were discharged after first aid,” noted a senior official at AIIMS. He added that injuries included wound on the head and limbs.

Violence broke out at JNU on Sunday night after masked men armed with sticks attacked students and teachers and damaged property on the campus, prompting the administration to call in police.

At least 18 people were injured and admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). JNU students’ union president Aishe Ghosh suffered a head injury.

The Left-controlled JNUSU and the RSS-affiliated ABVP blamed each other for the violence that continued for nearly two hours. Several disturbing videos that show masked people carrying sticks and bats have gone viral on social media.

Swara, whose mother Ira Bhaskar is a professor at the JNU, took to Twitter to appeal to the people on social media to reach the campus “to pressure the government and Delhi Police” to control the violence.

“Urgent appeal!!!! To all Delhiites PLS gather in large numbers outside the Main Gate of JNU campus on Baba Gangnath Marg.. to pressure the govt. & #DelhiPolice to stop the rampage by alleged ABVP masked goons on JNU campus,” the actor captioned the video, adding that she was concerned about her parents’ safety who live at the campus.

Commenting on Swara’s video, Azmi said she was shocked by the violence and called for immediate action against the perpetrators.

“Is this really happening ? Im not in India and it all seems like a nightmare. 20 Students Admitted To AIIMS As Violence Breaks Out In JNU. Students and Teachers beaten. Reprehensible, Appalling Condemnable. Immediate action must be taken against the perpetrators,” she tweeted.

Aparna alleged that the JNU students were being beaten up by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) “goons“.

“How much longer are you going to look the other way? Or r u spineless? Yes I AM a liberal! Yes, I AM secular! And proud to be so if THIS is the alternative. Shame! Shame on ABVP & the police who are aiding & abetting them!” she tweeted.

Taapsee said it was saddening to see an educational institution “getting scarred forever“.

She shared a video allegedly showing the situation on campus.

“Such is the condition inside what we consider to be a place where our future is shaped. It’s getting scarred for ever. Irreversible damage. What kind of shaping up is happening here, it’s there for us to see...” Taapsee tweeted.

Zeeshan asked people to reach the JNU in large numbers.

“By closing the doors and roads they have given free hand to their goons. Tell your friends and relatives, tell everyone and gather there together,” the actor said in a tweet.

“Friends in Okhla and Jamia go to Shaheen Bagh. This #JNUAttack has been done to divert attention and they’ll surely attack Shaheen Bagh at night,” he tweeted.

Zeeshan further called for peace amid violence and urged people to exercise patience and take care of their friends.

Director Anurag Kashyap retweeted several purported videos of violence and vandalism from the JNU.

Mehta asked Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to intervene.

“Dear @ArvindKejriwal. Can you do something to stop the violence in JNU?” the filmmaker tweeted.

Writer Kanika Dhillon too asked Kejriwal to step in.

“Sir!!! Pls atleast reach there!!!! Ur presence will help!!!!” she said.

“Masaan” fame director Neeraj Ghaywan asked the police to help the students.

“Extremely distressing video from JNU. @DelhiPolice, these are students, the future of our nation, like your own. Help them please!” Ghaywan wrote.

Filmmaker Vinod Kapri also shared an alleged video from JNU campus.

“This is a horrifying video. At least 30-40 masked goons are vandalising JNU hostel. Delhi Police is nowhere to be seen. This has full political support. TV news channels have shut their eyes,” Kapri tweeted.

Filmmaker-composer Vishal Bhardwaj also condemned the violence. “It’s shameful and enraging to see what’s happening in #JNUViolence,” he said.

Director Bejoy Nambiar questioned the silence of many in the film fraternity.

“All you silent friends of mine watch this !!! Watch this & then come and talk to me about how concerned you are about the damage to ‘public’ property. How is THIS OK ? How can we watch students & teachers being brutally attacked like this and stay quiet ?” he asked.

“#SOSJNU @DelhiPolice this is NOT OK. JNUSU president has been brutally beaten up. She is severely wounded. Media Please het there @ndtv @BBCIndia #JNU,” tweeted director Onir.

Actor Richa Chadha said: “A few months ago JNU gave the world a Nobel laureate. Now JNU teachers and students are being beaten up for protesting a fee hike. World watches.”

“Frightening visuals from #JNU. Praying that the #Delhipolice intervene swiftly and protect the students. Stay safe students. What a scary world we live in,” wrote actor Siddharth on the microblogging site.

Director Anubhav Sinha tweeted: “Either this Government is not capable of maintaining law and order or they are complicit...”

Director Anurag Basu said: “We can’t remain mute spectators anymore! #SOSJNU“.

The doctors, who had come in an ambulance with medical supplies to help the injured students, were not allowed to enter the campus.

“Around 100 masked goons attacked our ambulance with stones and lathis when we tried to enter the campus,” said Praveen, a general surgeon at Maharishi Valmiki Hospital.

Another doctor, who had come on his own as a volunteer to treat the students, said: “The police remained a mute spectator while our ambulance was being surrounded and attacked by the mob.”

Dr. Praveen added that the mob broke a window of the ambulance. “The mob even tried to drag and pull one of the doctors out of the ambulance’s window,” he said, pointing towards the doctor, who had received injuries.

A visibly rattled woman doctor in the group said, “The goons were wearing masks and helmets. I could smell that they were drunk. They even tried to take our mobile phones as we were taking videos.”

“There is no safety even for ambulance and doctors,” another doctor.

269,2020/01/06,"Will not implement NRC, CAA if voted to power: Congress","The Delhi Congress on Sunday said that if it was elected to power in Delhi, it would not implement the National Population Register (NPR), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the amended Citizenship Act in its present form.

The State unit of the Congress said that the issue has been raised at the first meeting of the Manifesto Committee ahead of the Delhi Assembly election and it was decided that the party’s stand would be included in the manifesto.

Chairman of the Manifesto Committee, Ajay Maken, said that there was a huge difference in the NPR of 2010 and the one of 2020 as the Modi government at the Centre has added six new “illegal” questions and was in violation of Article 14 in the Constitution.

“The BJP has done an illegal act by dividing people. Details collected from the fresh questions included in the NPR are linked to the NRC, and are part of a conspiracy by the BJP-led Central government to push citizens’ list in the garb of the NPR,” Mr. Maken said.

Giving his own example, Mr. Maken said that the NPR requires people to declare the “date and place of birth of both the parents” for the first time. “In this NPR, a person like me might have a problem... if a person like me is asked where your father and mother were born. My parents were born in Pakistan. Where will I get their details from?” Mr. Maken said.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra alleged that the Centre was trying to divert people’s attention from pressing issues like economic distress, price rise, unemployment, and using policies to divide the people and the country on the basis of community and caste.

Mr. Chopra also hit out at Aam Aadmi Party, alleging that it had been “silent” on the issue. He demanded that a special session be called of the Delhi Assembly so that the Delhi government may clear its stand on CAA and the police attack on students of the Jamia Millia Islamia for peacefully protesting against the amended Act as the police forced their way into the campus without the permission of the Vice-Chancellor.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/will-not-implement-nrc-caa-if-voted-to-power-congress/article30489092.ece

The mob also attacked an ambulance, carrying nine doctors, while it tried to enter the campus to provide medical assistance to the injured students. Some of the accused deflated the tyres of the vehicle.

‘Don’t click pictures’

The mob also asked individuals not to click pictures or take videos of the incident. They attacked those who refused to listen to them.

The ABVP supporters here blamed the “leftists” for the stone-pelting at Periyar hostel. The mob chanted “Vande Mataram”, “Jai Shree Ram”, “Delhi Police Zindabad”, “Desh ke gadaron ko goli maron salon ko”. Some of them even called the students “Naxalites”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/urr535/article30489088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05JNU2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/faces-covered-rods-in-hand-mob-creates-ruckus-outside-jnu-gate/article30489089.ece
271,2020/01/06,High Court orders CBI inquiry over continued custody parole,"The Delhi High Court has ordered CBI inquiry against jail and police officials here over the continued custody parole, for over five months, of an undertrial facing trial in three different cases.

A Bench of Justice Manmohan and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal also sought explanation from an Additional Sessions Judge at Tis Hazari Court here for “his conduct in granting the custody parole” and extending it through subsequent orders.

Not more than 6 hours

As per Rule 1203 of the Delhi Prison Rules, 2018, an undertrial prisoner can be granted custody parole by a trial court in case of an exigency for a period of not more than six hours, excluding the time taken to reach the destination and return to the prison.

The High Court’s direction came on a criminal reference made by Special Judge Kiran Bansal at Rouse Avenue District Courts here seeking clarity on whether an accused, who is in custody in more than one case is required to obtain custody parole from each and every court concerned or the accused can move to anyone court of his choice for seeking custody parole.

Special Judge Bansal submitted that one accused Sukesh alias Sukash Chandrashekhar, who is facing trial in three different cases, in three different courts, including her’s, was not produced before her court on the date fixed.

The Judge submitted that the accused was granted custody parole by the order of an Additional Sessions Judge at Tis Hazari Court but he failed to seek permission from her court. She further said no such information was received either from the accused or from the Jail Superintendent concerned.

The High Court said: “The accused in the present case, astonishingly has been on custody parole from July 05, 2019, which was in gross violation of the Delhi Prison Rules, 2018 and law pertaining to the custody parole. Strangely enough, the State failed to challenge the order dated July 05, 2019, and the subsequent orders...and no action was taken by the concerned authorities.”

It noted that if one court had issued an order of custody parole, it was incumbent on the Director-General Prison or Jail Superintendent to inform the other two courts about the absence of the accused, obtain the next date for production of the accused.

Next hearing on Jan. 20

The High Court directed the State government to take the accused in custody forthwith and sent him to the concerned jail and posted the case for further hearing on January 20.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/high-court-orders-cbi-inquiry-over-continued-custody-parole/article30489087.ece
272,2020/01/06,Overflowing sewage on National Highway-19 sparks safety concerns,"For more than six months, sewage from Seekri village has been overflowing onto the service road and a stretch of the Delhi-Agra highway, causing a major nuisance to locals and motorists.

The authorities and the Panchayat, however, shift the blame on the matter. The flooded road hampers the movement of the vehicles, put the pedestrians to inconvenience, emanates foul smell, and also causes water-borne diseases and accidents on the National Highway.

Running a kiosk off the highway for over a decade, Majlis from Nuh, said the sewage from the village earlier flowed down a drain. However, the trouble began six months back when the highway was widened to six-lanes and a service road was constructed over the drain, he said.

Though pipelines have been laid under the service road to allow the sewage to reach the storm water drain along the highway, but the pipelines and the drain get frequently choked due to indiscriminate dumping of the garbage, including plastic waste, in an open nallah along the highway.

The small drains from the village fall into this nallah, which in turn is connected to the storm water drain with the pipelines. The choked pipelines and storm water drain lead to overflow of the sewage to the service road and the Agra-Delhi carriageway of the highway.

Dotted with vendors, kiosks and tea stalls, the nallah, close to the local market, remains full with garbage. A waste dumping site has also come up near the nallah and the garbage often ends up in it.

Local resident Ranjit, who also runs a makeshift kiosk, said he had complained to Sarpanch on several occasions but was told that it was the responsibility of the highways authority. He said the highway authorities came to clear the water but not before it had entered their kiosks. The kiosk owners had put sandbags to prevent the water from entering their premises. Ranjit’s mother recalled that it was the worst near Rakshabandan festival and then Diwali, adding that the water was not cleared for the over a month this time around.

Breeding ground

The overflowed water has also affected his business, said Majlis. “Customers find it difficult to reach my shop due to water all around,” he said. Local villager Siddhu Khan said the stagnant sewage was a breeding ground for the mosquitoes and water-borne diseases. He suggested the nallah be covered and made pucca.

Prahlad, who runs an eggs-stall, said the water overflowing onto the highway led to frequent accidents. Not expecting sewage on the highway, the motorists, coming at a high speed, took sharp turn fearing potholes and met accidents. “A portion of the road is damaged due to constant water-logging and a truck overturned a month ago. The highway authorities then closed the right turn near the spot to the road passing through Seekri and connecting a dozen villages,” said Prahlad.

Auto-rickshaw driver Lal Singh said the road passing through Seekri connecting to other villages also remained waterlogged due to overflowing of sewage and crates had appeared on it. Sarpanch Anil Kumar alleged the drain to discharge the sewage was demolished by the agency that constructed the highway with a promise to make it again but did not do so. He said he was aware of the situation but the Panchayat did not have funds to make a drain. He said he had made requests to the Block Development and Panchayat Officer and NHAI officials in this regard.

Delhi Agra Toll Road official P.K. Singh said the water-logging was caused due to the choking of the pipelines and the storm water drain. Mr. Singh said the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad had made drains in many villages along the highway to discharge sewage, but Seekri was outside the municipal limits causing the problem. He added the road was also damaged due to constant water-logging. NHAI, project director, Badarpur, Mohammad Safi told The Hindu that a notice was served to the Panchayat a month back to regularly clean the nallah to prevent the choking of the pipelines and the storm water drain. He added that a proposal for a drain to carry the sewage of the village was being considered as a lasting solution.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/psz3db/article30489083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05SEWAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/overflowing-sewage-on-national-highway-19-sparks-safety-concerns/article30489084.ece

274,2020/01/06,Attack in JNU campus: ‘Students wanting registration beaten up by those opposing it’,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration on Sunday strongly condemned the violent incident that took place inside the campus.

Registrar of the university, Pramod Kumar, said since afternoon, the campus witnessed scuffles at the Schools as well as inside the hostel premises between the groups of students who wanted to stop the registration and those who wanted to register and continue their studies. “At 4.30 p.m., a group of students, who are against the registration process moved aggressively from the admin block and reached the hostels. The administration immediately contacted the police. However, by the time the police reached the university, the group of students opposing the registration beat up those who were in favour of it,” said Mr. Kumar.

He added that a few men with their faces covered also entered the Periyar hostel rooms and attacked the students with sticks and rods. “It is unfortunate that a group of students with their violent means of protests is preventing thousands of non-agitating students from pursuing their academic activities,” he said, adding that the administration stands by every student who wants to continue their academic programmes peacefully.

“The JNU administration feels great pain and anguish for the students who have been injured in the incident. The university is always known for peaceful and democratic protests. The administration will not tolerate any form of violence on the campus. A complaint is being filed against the culprits,” a statement issued by the university read.

It also appealed to all the stakeholders of the university to maintain peace and not get provoked by any misinformation.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2i5sbm/article30489201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001NG7HGjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/students-wanting-registration-beaten-up-by-those-opposing-it/article30489081.ece
275,2020/01/06,Man held for raping toddler,"A 22-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping a 15-month-old girl in Sector 58 here, the police said on Sunday.

The toddler is undergoing treatment at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi and her condition is said to be critical.

The accused was arrested on Saturday under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

He was produced before the court on Sunday and sent to judicial custody.

He allegedly took the girl away from her mother on the pretext of buying toys for her on Friday night. When she did not return home, the family began to look for her.

After a few hours, the accused came with the girl, who was bleeding, to drop her back. When the girl’s grandmother questioned him about her condition, he punched her on the face and tried to escape.

Locals protest

276,2020/01/06,"After denials, police admit they did open fire on December 15 during anti-CAA protests","Nearly three weeks after the police fired tear-gas shells in the city and thrashed students inside the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) library, a senior officer confirmed that they had opened fire during the anti-CAA protests here.

Confirming reports in NDTV and The Indian Express, the police officer, who preferred not to go on record, said a Special Investigation Team (SIT) would probe all incidents of violence, including the use of firearms by the police.

Since the incident, the Delhi police had maintained that no gunshots were fired on protesters.

Even a protester undergoing treatment at Safdurjung Hospital is suspected to have received gunshot injury but later it was claimed that injury was from shards of tear-gas canisters. In a video shot by a resident and uploaded on social media, three policemen were seen using a wall as a shield while stones were being pelted at them.

Two policemen pulled out their service pistols and fired three shots in the direction of the protesters and they ran away. The video was shot at Mathura Road on December 15.

“We won’t be able to confirm it as the investigation is with SIT. If it was done, then it was an act of self-defence. No separate inquiry is required,” said the officer.

A senior officer who was at the spot, saw the policemen firing, had mentioned it in police diary.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/8zxarm/article30490836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05JAMIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/after-denials-police-admit-they-did-open-fire-on-december-15/article30489076.ece
277,2020/01/06,School for have-nots: a Delhi Police constable’s effort to educate 50 children,"Four years ago, a chance encounter between Sachin – an IAS aspirant – and a Delhi Police Constable changed the lives of several children of labourers working inside the Red Fort.

Mr. Singh has been running the makeshift school inside the fort for a few years now. He joined the police force 10 years ago on January 5. It was his third year in a Delhi University college when he cleared the examination after three attempts. His parents —Vasudev and Shashi — used to iron clothes for a living, he said, adding that he did the same till Class 11 before he started selling corn.

Importance of education

Growing up in a JJ Colony in Meera Bagh, he said, he understood the importance of education. Sharing an instance, he said once he and his siblings tried to watch TV at their neighbour’s house when the latter shooed them away. The neighbours treated them differently because they didn’t “look educated”, he believes. Mr. Singh said when he met Sachin at Red Fort in 2016, he saw a reflection of his childhood.

On their first meet, Mr. Singh had asked Sachin to leave the premises as he thought the boy was a wanderer. He continued telling Sachin the same for the next three days until the latter broke down. “I asked him what was he doing inside the fort? He told me that he had come from Maharashtra and was in the city to study for UPSC exams. He could not afford coaching classes so he was studying all by himself. He used to study here all day and would then go to a gurdwara nearby to sleep,” recalled the Constable.

Sachin cleared two written examinations that year but got stuck in the interview round. He then left, said Mr. Singh. After a few days, Mr. Singh called him when Sachin told him: “I won’t show you my face till I become an IAS”.

But before leaving the city, Mr. Singh had made Sachin start a makeshift school to educate the needy. The Constable had told him that while studying, Sachin could also teach the children inside the monument.

Sachin’s first student was 16-year-old Ankita Sharma. She now is a teacher at this school, which is attended by labourers’ children from 5.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. inside a temple in the Red Fort premises.

“The school had started with two-three kids. Then I went to the jhuggis and forced the labourers them to send the kids to the school. Most of these children go to schools in their villages but they are here for months. Therefore, it is important that they don’t spend their time in bad activities,” Mr. Singh said.

In the next four years, the open school managed to amass around 50-odd students.

Hurdles crossed

Running the school comes at a cost. Mr. Singh, who has to take care of his own two children, has received flak from his wife for spending a chunk of his meagre salary on the education of many.

“Initially, she fought with me but later she understood. In 2018, because of finances, the school was also shut for 10-15 days but with some help, I started it again.”

The school provides the children with notebooks, pens and pencils. Out in the open courtyard, stands a green board against a temple wall, while the children sit on cloth sheets given to them by the school.

Mr. Singh has procured halogen lights over many years from the numerous events that Red Fort has been a venue for. Not only do they cover the school’s premises, but also the kids’ way back to their jhuggis.

“Their safety and security, especially of little girls, is very important,” he said. In running the school, senior police officers have helped Mr. Singh time and again with stationary and money among other things.

At the school, the youngest is a 2-year-old and the oldest is a 15-year-old. They are taught alphabets, numbers and tables, the difference between good and bad touch, the importance of hygiene and the dangers of chewing tobacco.

Two boys and a girl – all aged between five and eight years – raised their hands in the class of 50, when Ankita asked: “How many of you have quit chewing tobacco?”

Six-year-old Pooja, who studies in Class IV in a school in her village in Ranchi, said she has learnt “ABCD, ginti [counting], pahade [tables], vowels in this school.” She had come to Delhi over a month ago and will return in the next 10 days.

Fourteen-year-old Sakshi is said to be among the brightest here. This is the only school that she attends and is proud to have added fruits and vegetables to her vocabulary.

Two years ago, when Shahnawaz Khan was all of three, his parents made him sit in the school, which he was not too fond of. However, he seems to love it now. Even though he doesn’t like studying too much, he sits here with due diligence – his notebook opened and pencil sharpened – looking at Ankita.

For Ankita, whose parents also reside in the jhuggis inside the monument, teaching these children started casually. Her mother used to teach kids.

She said her teacher in a private school once told her that teaching is a rewarding experience. A student of commerce, she either wants to become a mathematics teacher or a bank manager, she said.

When the class ended and the kids started to leave, Mr. Singh reminisced about the Delhi Police’s motto and said: “This is also Shanti Seva Nyaya for me.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/i4m3c2/article30489074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05SCHOOL2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/school-for-have-nots-a-delhi-police-constables-effort-to-educate-50-children/article30489075.ece
278,2020/01/06,Shaheen Bagh agitation: police put rumours to bed,"Amidst reports that security personnel were trying to remove those protesting against the amended Citizenship Act from Shaheen Bagh, the police on Sunday clarified that they had gone to the area to resolve an argument, which had ensued between a group of protesters and shopkeepers.

The police said they make regular visits to the spot to ensure law and order remain intact. They said they were informed by one of the shopkeepers on Sunday that some protesters were not allowing them to open their showrooms.

On reaching the spot, the police saw that an argument had ensued between a few protestors and the shop owner over the issue.

“We tried to pacify them. After the dispute was resolved, the man opened his showroom and later the barricades were again put in place,” an officer said.

A protester, Sajid Mojib, said the police had removed barricades and the locals to keep the stir in control in Shaheen Bagh.

“The rumours were that the police will launch a crackdown during 3 a.m.-8 a.m. at Shaheen Bagh. We will continue to protest peacefully and ready to face any kind of situation. For any mishap, the administration will be held responsible,” he said.

279,2020/01/06,"Artists paint CP pavements in protest against CAA, NRC","Several artists gathered at Connaught Place to write slogans and paint the pavements to protest against the amended Citizenship Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) on Sunday.

The artists wrote down various slogans like “Hum Bhi Dekhenge”, “Bol Ke Labh Azaad Hain Tere’ and “ Save the Constitution of India” in addition to “Reject CAA and NRC” near gate number 6 of Rajiv Chowk metro station.

They were joined by several passers-by who contributed by writing slogans like “Secular India” and “Dharm Nishpeksh Bharat”.

A few erase words

A few of the passers-by asked others not to pay attention to these “gimmicks”. Some of them even began to erase the word “secular” written on the ground while chanting “Jai Shree Ram”. In response, the protesters sang the National Anthem and also protected their artworks.

The police present at the site also asked a group, raising slogans in support of CAA, to disperse.

A 56-year-old filmmaker, Rahul Roy, one of the organisers of the event said: “It is important for people to express what they are feeling at this point of time.” A 22-year-old student of Ambedkar University, Jasmine Yadav, said: “We are against the kind of hatred and intolerance that the current government is pushing us forward to...this is a peaceful protest.”

280,2020/01/06,150 Mohalla Clinics inaugurated,"The Delhi government inaugurated 150 Mohalla Clinics on Sunday taking the total number of such clinics in the Capital to 450. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, speaking at the inaugural function, said that it was for the first time that expansion of healthcare facilities on such a large scale was happening in the country.

“People of Delhi flagged off a new bandwagon of development in the previous elections. Now it runs at a speed of 100 km per hour. Don’t press brake; you should accelerate its speed to 200 km per hour”, Mr. Kejriwal said while making a pitch for the upcoming elections.

“When we came to power in 2015, we observed that there is no lack of big hospitals in Delhi. But for the common people, it was difficult to access these hospitals for the treatment of small illnesses. Due to this, these hospitals used to see a huge rush. So we realised that if we start smaller clinics, people can avail the services without having to travel a lot and that also reduced the rush in bigger hospitals in the city,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

The Chief Minister added that his government was not only building Mohalla Clinics for enhancing healthcare facilities, but also constructing world-class hospitals.

15,000 beds in 5 years

“In the last 70 years, different governments in Delhi have built 10,000 beds in government hospitals. But in the last five years, 15,000 new beds have been added in government hospitals. The expansion plan is under way and the foundation stone for many big hospitals has been laid,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

2 crore patients served

“Since its launch in 2015, Mohalla Clinics have served two crore OPD patients and conducted 18 lakh tests till November 2019. Earlier, the number of patients in Delhi government hospitals was three crore annually but since the AAP-led government made hospitals better in terms of infrastructure and cleanliness, and made treatment and medicines free, the turnout of patients has now doubled to six crore annually,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He added that the Delhi government could transform education, healthcare and transport and make electricity and water available free in five years as the people of Delhi elected a transparent and accountable government.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/150-mohalla-clinics-inaugurated/article30489065.ece
281,2020/01/06,"Other than abuse, nothing in speech: CM","Reacting to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s speech on Sunday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that Mr. Shah chose to “abuse” him instead of talking about development and pointing out shortcomings of the AAP-led government.

Mr. Shah had in his speech accused Mr. Kejriwal of “wasting” public money on advertisements and “misleading” people.

“I heard the entire speech of the Home Minister, Amit Shah ji. I thought he would point out the shortcomings of our work and talk about the development of Delhi. He did not say anything else except abusing me [sic],” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted.

“If they [BJP] have suggestions for Delhi, then they should tell us and we will implement them in the next five years,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

Speaking at a town hall meeting in north-west Delhi where he was presenting a report card of his government’s five-year term, Mr. Kejriwal said that Delhi’s healthcare schemes are better than the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat Yojana.

“In Delhi, healthcare is completely free for all irrespective of rich or poor. Ayushman Bharat Yojana assures insurance for people, but those who own scooter, fridge, and cellphones and have an income of ₹10,000 are excluded. With these criteria applied, hardly anyone will be eligible for the scheme. Therefore, we have decided not to implement it,” Mr. Kerjiwal said. He added that if the Delhi government wants, Ayushman Bharat can be implemented right away, adding that the scheme, however, will not simply work in Delhi.

The Chief Minister also said that earlier, people had to spend their entire savings or sell their properties to save their lives in case of any kind of serious illness but that the healthcare infrastructure in Delhi’s government hospitals has been significantly improved now. “People can avail of treatment, surgery and various tests free of cost. Delhi government provides support of up to ₹15 lakh for the treatment of severe illness at private hospitals in Delhi,” he said.

‘Fake registration’

He also hits out at the BJP government, saying that they were providing “fake registration” to people from unauthorised colonies. “How can a property be registered on agricultural land? You have to change the land use first. They said they are regularising the colonies, but instead of regularising them, they are providing registration of properties on agricultural lands. The change in land use and mapping should be done first for the registration process to take place,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He said that all was not well in today’s politics in the country and that there was a lot to change. “In the last five years, irrespective of manifold difficulties, we tried our best to ensure that people get the best from the government. There is an increasing trust between the people of Delhi and the Delhi government because they know that taxpayers’ money will not be wasted, ” Mr. Kejriwal said.

New schemes

Responding to a question on what new schemes his government would reintroduce if voted back to power, he said that they would continue working with the same dedication.

“Cleaning up the Yamuna, cleaning up Delhi, redesigning roads, reducing air pollution, resolving traffic congestion and parking issues and providing 24-hour tap water facility to the people of Delhi are some of the key steps that we will take in the next five years,” Mr. Kejriwal said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/k74y2t/article30489040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE06KEJRIWAL2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/other-than-abuse-nothing-in-speech-cm/article30489041.ece
282,2020/01/06,Rising against the odds,"Past 10 p.m. on New Year’s Day, Phoolkumari (22) covered herself in a blanket as she, along with her mother, were getting ready to sleep on the pavement outside AIIMS. She had undergone chemotherapy a few hours ago at the hospital. “Whatever I eat, I vomit… Due to weakness I feel colder,” she said. The minimum temperature that night was 2.4 degrees celsius.

The 22-year-old from Kaimur district in Bihar, a 12-year-old boy who had come from Uttar Pradesh for a check-up after being operated and a 50-year-old woman waiting for heart surgery were among those huddled up on the pavement outside the hospital on the cold January night. Over 100 others gave them company with flattened cardboard boxes doubling up as mattresses and a few with the luxury of plastic sheets as roofs.

For those without a roof over their head, it was not only cold winter nights with single-digit temperatures that they had to deal with but also one of the coldest winters in over a century. The Capital recorded its coldest winter day with the maximum temperature falling to 9.4 degrees Celsius on December 30. December also saw 18 consecutive cold days and the MeT department has forecast a cold wave again after January 8.

Over occupancy

Finding shelter for those stranded in the city due to cancellations of trains due to fog or medical treatment is not an easy task. A Delhi government-run free temporary night shelter at gate number 2 of AIIMS with a capacity of 15 beds had 30 people for the night. The one on the opposite side with a capacity of 46 beds had 60 people by 10.45 p.m.

“People are sharing a bed and we were full last night also. Most of the tents [temporary night shelters] near AIIMS are full. They will find space in the ones a little away,” said Ved Pal, caretaker of the second night shelter.

Sooraj Kumar (12) and his father, who had come from Uttar Pradesh for a check-up and were sleeping next to Phoolkumari, said that they were not aware of the free night shelter. Many others sleeping in the open reiterated the same.

Free blankets

Anil Sharma, care taker of the tent at gate number 2 said that many sleep outside as they get free blankets which they then sell for a price. “Most of them stuff the blankets in sacks and sell it later. They would not come and stay in the tent even if we ask them to,” he said.

The 12-year-old lifted a quilt they had got from their village to show the three blankets they got from people distributing them outside the hospital.

“About an hour ago someone came and asked us to sell the blanket we had got for a mere ₹100, but we did not give it,” the boy said.

In over an hour spent in the area, at least three different groups had come to distribute blankets and some to distribute food, like the people who gave Phoolvati an apple. Some of them sleeping outside were seen tucking the blankets they had got under their belongings and rushing for another one.

To protect herself from the chilling weather, 11-year-old Sita was seen wearing an oversized brown sweater with a torn woollen bottom and a beanie cap. Sita and her mother Rajjo spend their day at the traffic light in east Delhi’s Vivek Vihar; nights are spent outside a temple in the area. The father is a drunkard whose whereabouts the mother-daughter duo is unaware of.

“The last few days were very cold. An uncle gave me this sweater a few days ago. He was very nice,” smiled Sita sitting next to a bonfire. Before she was given a sweater, she managed with two undersized sweaters.

Other who spend the day with Sita said that she is the chirpiest among the lot. She smiles through adversity, they said. “Hamare liye kya hai… kabhi zada thand to kabhi zada garmi… kabhi paani ko taraste hain to kabhi kambal ko [What about us… we bear with extreme cold and extreme hot… in one season we crave for water and in another, a blanket],” they said.

The homeless people , said the nights are unbearable but blankets provided by temple officials and locals come in handy. The bonfire of course helps.

Rohit (14) sells pens to motorists. His parents stay at a different red light in the area. They don’t visit him often. Sometimes, he also cleans the cars’ mirrors when the signal is red.

He recalled a night four days ago. “I had to beg people to give me something to wear on top of two thin sweaters I was wearing. No one helped. I had fought with one from the bunch so I didn’t ask them for help. I slept shivering.”

For 24-year-old Rinku, who stays at a permanent night shelter at Sarai Kale Khan along with his wife and a three-month-old child, this has been a challenging winter. Rinku himself has been staying at the night shelter for the fourth consecutive year now and with the addition of a child he does want a better home for his family. However, even after doing a 12-hour shift at a local canteen, he still cannot afford a rented house.

“There are so many expenses. I want my family to have a home of their own, but that is not possible now. This time the winter is very cold, but the night shelter has been a blessings for us,” said Rinku.

“We cook our own food here and get blankets and mattress at night. What else can we ask for,” said Ricky, who hails from Reva district of Madhya Pradesh.

Around 9.30 p.m. on New Year day, 49- year-old Rajani and a couple of women and young boys were sitting around a bonfire at the entrance of the night shelter.

Livelihood issue

Rajni, whose husband worked as an engineer in the Railways, has been staying at the night shelter for the last eight months. Asked how she ended up staying at the place, Rajni said that she has been fighting a protracted battle against the Railways for pension after the death of her husband.

A resident of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, Rajni said she has been working as a maid at a house in Govindpuri to support her and her 27-year-old son who does the running around the Railways office for the pension.

This winter was particularly difficult for her as this was the first time that she has been forced to leave the comfort of her home and reside besides 60 to 70 people inside a single dorm in a new city.

“Everything else is fine. I have no issues on the facilities at the shelter. I hope to get back home soon as the pension work is almost complete,” she said.

283,2020/01/06,"Shah, Modi to lead BJP’s poll campaign in the Capital","Addressing Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) booth-level workers in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly elections here on Sunday, party president Amit Shah signalled a campaign to be run under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

BJP’s government will be formed in Delhi under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said Mr. Shah.

Highlighting his involvement in the campaign, Mr. Shah told party workers that he, as their president, would start group meetings in the neighbourhoods of Delhi and reach out to individual households. He also appealed to the workers to do the same and said that the election was not only to be fought only through rallies and posters, but also through the outreach programme. He asked party workers to highlight the work carried out in the city by the Central government and to “expose the false promises” made by the Kejriwal government. Later in the evening, Mr. Shah, along with party working president J.P. Nadda, went door-to-door and kicked off the campaign.

Mr. Shah attacked the Kejriwal government on multiple fronts, saying that the Aam Admi Party (AAP) had managed to fool the people of Delhi once during the 2015 Assembly elections, but were wiped out in the subsequent municipal and Lok Sabha elections.

Mr. Shah condemned the AAP government for spending public money on advertisements “congratulating” people for having begun various schemes. “What work have you [AAP government] completed in five years?” he asked.

He also attacked the Chief Minister for denying permission to prosecute JNU students in a sedition case, arguing that through this, the Kejriwal government was supporting the ‘tukde tukde gang’. Mr. Shah also said that various promises made by AAP, such as opening new schools, colleges and hospitals had not materialised, adding that the State government did not allow various Central schemes such as the Ayushman Bharat Yojana to be implemented here. He alleged that nearly ₹10,000 crore funds had not been given to the municipal bodies in an attempt to “cripple” them.

Highlighting some of the works carried out by the Centre in Delhi, Mr. Shah said that the long-standing demand to regularise unauthorised colonies was being met by the government with registrations having been started. He said that the promise of allotting pakka houses to people living in 35,000 jhuggi jhopris was fulfilled by the Prime Minister, adding that surveys of up to 160 such JJ clusters had started. He went on to highlight the DDA’s land pooling policy.

Apart form this, he highlighted developmental works such as construction of parks, cycle tracks, extension of metro lines and spoke of developing a “Yamuna river front” along the lines of Sabarmati river front. With such a river front,

284,2020/01/06,Protests in AMU after JNU violence,"Days after unrest in the campus over the contentious citizenship law, protests were held at the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) late on Sunday night against violence at the JNU.

A spokesperson of protesting students said that a march was held in the night to express solidarity with the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students, who were attacked by masked men armed with sticks.

In a statement, the AMU Teachers’ Association (AMUTA) condemned the violence.

AMUTA secretary Najmul Islam urged the Chief Justice of India to take suo motu cognisance of the “unprecedented situation arising from Sunday’s assault on JNU students and teachers“.

Senior Superintendent of Police Akash Kulahari said police had been deployed at sensitive points all around the campus as a precautionary measure.

Till midnight, the protests have been peaceful, the officer said.

Former AMU students’ union president Faizul Hasan said students would hold a peaceful march on Monday to express solidarity with all those who are holding peaceful protests against the amended Citizenship Act.

The AMU, which was to reopen on January 6, has already extended the winter break keeping in view the continuing protests against the amended citizenship law.

According to an AMU notice, the decision to extend the vacation was taken after a meeting chaired by Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor on Wednesday.

A detailed schedule for the reopening of the university “in a phased manner” will be notified after the reviewing the situation.

On December 15, the university had announced an extended winter break following violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) on the campus that left over 60 people, including 40 students, AMU security staff and police personnel injured.

Violence broke out at JNU on Sunday night as masked men armed with sticks attacked students and teachers and damaged property on the campus, prompting the administration to call in police which conducted a flag march.

At least 18 people, including JNU Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh, were injured and admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) as chaos reigned on the campus for nearly two hours.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7bz97e/article30313967.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/protests-in-amu-after-jnu-violence/article30489008.ece
285,2020/01/06,Service to God,"The relationship between the jivatma and the Paramatma and other such esoteric knowledge contained in the sastras find the simplest of expressions in the Tiruppavai hymns to reach out to even the commonest of the common. The Vaishnava tradition lays great emphasis on service to God and holds this as the greatest wealth and privilege for the jivatma, pointed out Sri Rajahamsam Swamy in a discourse.

Lakshmana is called Lakshmi Sampanna, meaning he is endowed with the abundant wealth — rendering selfless service to God. Andal inculcates this Sesha-Seshi bhava which helps bhakti to take root in the devotee and also nurtures it. She points out that God is the sole master of all and all others in His creation as His subjects. So every jivatma is bound to serve Him. Andal associates herself with the Gopis of Brindavan who are fortunate to be in the company of Krishna. In her eyes, the Gopis are great bhagavatas, who reflect the characteristics of true devotees. The Lord too regards His devotees as very dear to Him. From verses six to fifteen, the maidens who are all steeped in Krishna bhakti gather to wake up those who are still asleep. Acharyas consider the fifteenth verse, ‘Elle Ilankiliye,’ as reflecting the very essence of Tiruppavai. What emerges from the dialogue that ensues between the girl who is woken up and those outside, is that ideally like-minded devotees should congregate to seek the Lord and also seek in particular this boon of service to Him.

Since the highest attainment for the jivatma is to be selected to serve God, there is urgency and sincerity in the plea. Should not one make use of the available opportunity, one’s present lifetime, to seek God? In this process, the devotee automatically imbibes the highest values of humility, devotional fervour, high regard for co-devotees, etc.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/service-to-god/article30496372.ece
286,2020/01/06,"Kashmir, CAA, Jamia, JNU: How families deal with ideological differences","Aman Pandey, 22, jokes that he now lies about going for protests instead of to parties. There’s no other way, he says, because at home, he’s been accused of being a desh drohi, a Naxal, and told he’ll be brainwashed into becoming a human bomb, by his father and his friends.

“It makes me feel disappointed,” he says. “I feel sceptical about society then.” He adds in the next breath though that he is hopeful of change, despite the fact that most of his family has right wing beliefs. Pandey couldn’t tell his family that he was in Jamia Millia Islamia when the police walked in. “I don’t know if the fear was real, but I felt they might not allow me to go back to college.”

We shall overcome

Across the country, lines are being drawn within families — microcosms of society — as individuals openly voice their opinions. Whether at the dinner table, on social visits, or over the phone, they talk of what they feel about the Citizenship Amendement Act (CAA) protests, Kashmir, and consequently, about life in India itself.

“The protests have brought it home to all of us. It’s not a one-off thing that you hear about once and switch off the TV. It’s forcing us to talk about it,” says Rupinder Kaur, 42, whose family supports the BJP, while she doesn’t.

Today, when families do feel the need to speak about it, they discover how deep ideological differences run. Earlier, they had a general idea of the way the family voted, but now it has become personal, even in non-minority households.

Prof. Sujatha Sriram, Dean at the School of Human Ecology, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai, talks of Hindu families that may not actively support the current government’s actions, but have an ‘It’s not something that’s going to affect us. Why are you people getting upset?’ attitude. “But the youth is saying, ‘We have friends — this is going to affect them.’ When you’re talking about a college environment there is going to be a lot of shared emotion that plays out,” she says.

The problem, says Sriram, is that we have a separate dialogue when we talk to friends and family. In the case of young adults, parents often don’t know where their children are, and from the younger person’s point of view, it’s best not to tell them, lest they’re forbidden to go — they’re adults but are still dependent financially on families. A student in Sriram’s class emailed her saying she’d be at a protest and because she couldn’t tell her parents, she was letting her professor know. “How else do schisms in families develop?” asks Sriram.

Rashi, 21, for instance, says that in the week following the attacks on students at Jamia Millia Islamia, she was not allowed to go out of the house. “I felt so guilty about not being able to participate. There was no other option, but to take the battle to social media,” she says, knowing her parents were not active on Twitter or Facebook. “It’s tough trying to make my parents understand that religion se pehle insaaniyat hoti hai, aapne hee sikhaya tha na (it’s humanity over religion, you taught us yourself),” she says.

A problem arises when people get taken to jail. From the parents’ point of view, it is a betrayal: not only is a son or daughter going against their beliefs, but they’re also jeopardising their own future. “Parents are afraid of what’s going to happen to them when sons grow up feeling they need to speak against the establishment,” says Sriram.

Silence! The court is in session

In the face of an argument, a younger person will be told they’re being disrespectful, that the wisdom of the elders must be respected, and that older people have known and seen history.

“The moment you feel you are hitting a point where the discussion is becoming uncomfortable for the older person, you change the topic, or it could lead to raised voices and unpleasantness,” says Rupinder. She’s currently doing a course on self-reflection using Gandhi’s teachings and his ways, as a mirror. “It makes you think, ‘What would Gandhi have done if he were alive today?’” She doesn’t talk about it to her family though.

Virender Puri, 80, who supports the CAA, says there is no fight in his family. This despite his son holding views opposite to his. “We try to convince them; they try to convince us,” he says, adding that “He (his son) is slowly, slowly agreeing. Now he stops talking and stops replying,” he says, tellingly.

Silence is what many people who find they’re out-shouted resort to, with the other party imagining their muteness is a sign of agreement. Invariably though, the loudest, most commandeering voices are of the older male members of families.

This silence, almost enforced by the male members, is patriarchy extending its arm to political decisions as well. “My mother’s side has always been a Congress family,” says Vibhawari Verma, 24. But when she was married, she gradually shifted allegiance to her husband’s beliefs (he is an RSS man and spends time working with the BJP). Her mother knew that “he’s the one going to take care of the entire family,” she says. Verma herself interned with the Aam Aadmi Party for a year and a half before she began a masters in public policy. A discussion with her father is difficult: “The point of contention is at the start of the conversation. There’s always a fight.” The last time, she ended up going and sitting in her room. It’s not just politics though. Verma says the pattern of not listening extends to other areas of life too.

Let them not say

While Verma comes from a political family, ‘decent’ middle-class households in India don’t usually engage with politics, much like other taboo topics that are not openly discussed: money and property splits, for instance. It’s not something that children are encouraged to talk about, either at home or in school. And yet, at 18, they can vote, without really having had healthy discussions about it, even with peers.

Verma says it’s important to talk about politics early in life. She herself went to a fairly ‘protected’ college on South Campus, but made the effort to visit North campus and understand the election system and the politics at play there.

The quelling of an individual’s beliefs and their place in the family though, indicates something deeper. The fissures today “don’t widen the gap; it’s another element in the gap,” says Rupinder, who feels it may impact relationships of young adults with their parents, but not of older individuals, used to the pattern of only engaging in ‘comfortable’ topics.

In homes where discussions have always been open though, a difference of opinion is respected. In 26-year-old Reet Kapur’s case, her father supports the current government, but she says they talk about this daily and she questions him on some of his beliefs. “Dad may say something like, ‘problematic elements’ and I’ll ask him ‘Isn’t that stereotyping?’ He has come to respect my opinion as an adult,” she says.

It’s similar for Shakti Khanna, 41, who says there’s a “huge difference of opinion” at home. Her father was a Congress supporter “until Mr. Modi arrived and their generation became disillusioned with the Congress. He has now slowly become a bhakt,” she says. They have discussions daily, even heated arguments, but because the culture at home was never to obey blindly, it hasn’t had an impact on their relationship. Her parents are with her, helping care for her newborn.

With this high level of political awareness, on New Year’s Eve, S. M. Tripathi, 21, a student at Jamia, broke up with his girlfriend of three and a half years, someone he’d considered marriage with. She’d remained neutral on the happenings last month, even as the violence raged around and Tripathi was himself injured.

“I’m very interested in politics, opinions — I talk to everyone on the bus or metro. I think diversity is essential, and someone need not have the same opinion as me, but she needs to trust what I’m doing,” he says. “I think I should have a life partner who has the same ideology,” he concludes.

287,2020/01/06,The Parsi link with Delhi,"The Parsis have a certain mystique about them. I realised this when I met Bapsybano Pavry, the only Indian Marchioness who had married the Marquess of Winchester. The interview took place when she was on her way to Tehran to meet the Shah of Iran, Mohd Reza Pahaivi, in 1967 to plead with him for the restoration of the Parsi fire temples. Most of these were demolished with the advent of Islam.

The Parsi origins go back to the Iranians who ruled as early as 3000 B.C. though the religion propagated by the prophet Zarathushtra flourished in Iran until the defeat of the Sassanian king Yazdegard III by the Arabs at the battle of Nihavand in 641 A.D. The community was persecuted and fled to India, settling down in Gujarat, from where they made their way to Bombay and other areas, coming to north India some 500 years ago, though some think it was much earlier.

The Parsi association with Delhi dates back to the time of Akbar, when Dastur Meherjirana of Navsari, the spiritual leader, impressed the emperor with his piety and knowledge. Thereafter, other learned Parsi where invited to Akbar’s capital, Fatehpur Sikri, where they took part in religious discourses with Hindu, Jain, Muslim and Christian scholars.

It can be conjectured that Parsi buildings must have been in existence at Agra and Delhi even in those times, but no trace of them remains now. However, an inscription bears testimony to the fact that the site of the old aramgah (cemetery) in Delhi was acquired by Jamsetjee Cavesjee Jussawala in 1869. This link in the Parsi connection with the Capital grew with the formation of the Parsi Anjuman in 1925. In 1913 there were hardly 30 or 40 Parsis in Delhi; there are now about a 1,000.

Just as one leaves Delhi Gate and enters Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, a signboard with the words ‘Delhi Parsi Anjuman’ greets the eyes. Behind the board in a compound are the Muhgusi Parsi Dharamshala, or rest house; and the Bhiwandiwall (community) Hall, located within the premises of the Anjuman. It also houses books on Zoroastrianism, its history and culture, and the Kaikhusuru Palonji Katrak Dar-e-Meher or Fire Temple.

There are three kinds of temples: Atash Benram, Atash Adarm, Agvary or Dar-e-Meher. There’s also the Atash Dadgah or the household fire in every Parsi home. The first fire temple in India was consecrated in 790 A.D. at Sanjan from the alat (instruments) brought by the Parsis from Khorasan. Hence, the importance of Delhi’s only Fire Temple.

Every day when the liturgy is performed at the Fire Temple, the names and deeds of the great saints and kings of Iran are remembered. As the early morning breeze blows in from the Yamuna, the beautiful dawn prayer Hosh-Baam is recited. The opening lines, ‘Through Asha most high, Asha most pure’, seem to merge with the first rays of the sun, for it is the sanctity of light that the temple personifies.

In a way it reflects the glory of Ahura Mazda, the supreme deity. Ahura means Lord, and Mazda, the wise or one full of light — the first and the last. Along with Ahura Mazda there are six other Ahuras, explains a Parsi worshipper at the temple. These are his six angles, who are also known as the six cardinal virtues, through whom only Ahura Mazda can be worshipped. This is borne out by the Avesta, the sacred scriptures and the Gathas.

The importance of the Fire Temple can be gauged from the fact that Parsis prefer to put their dead bodies in the Towers of Silence so that birds devour them. To bury them would be to defile the earth; burning would pollute the fire, the most sacred of all elements. The fire in the Atash Temple is never extinguished, reveals the worshipper. It is considered regal, with a crown hanging over the cauldron, three feet in diameter and four feet high. The fire in it is fed by a priest five times a day and on special occasions with wood.

In places like Delhi and Agra (where there is no Tower of Silence), Parsis have aramgahs, in which the dead are laid to rest. These places are named after theirs heroes like Rustam, Sohrah and the grey-eyed Zal, whose names are also recited every morning when the Parsi prayers are held with great solemnity and the strict participation of only community members.

Incidentally, Bapsybano’s marriage was a disaster. William Paulat never consummated it. He had an affair with the James Bond creator Ian Flemming’s mother, and the British aristocracy did not take kindly to her either. The Marchioness died in 1995, at the age of 93, in Bombay, where her father, Khurshidji Pavry, had been Head Priest.

288,2020/01/06,"File affidavit on missing cases, says HC","The Telangana High Court on Monday, after hearing a PIL petition on missing persons in the State, instructed the Home Secretary and the DGP to file a detailed affidavit with information on the number of missing cases reported in the past four years.

The affidavit should contain details like how many of the missing persons were traced, number of pending cases and the rehabilitation measures taken up by the government for the traced children, the bench said. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy passed the direction to file the affidavit by February 6, after hearing the PIL petition filed by a lawyer.

The bench noted that some gangs take children from Rajasthan to Bihar for cotton picking and they are eventually forced to work as bonded labourers. Observing that children of Telangana should not meet such a fate, the bench instructed the government to incorporate details of children who left homes, street children, child labourers, children forced into begging in the affidavit.

Instead of using official jargon, the authorities should prepare the affidavit based on ground reality and facts, the bench said. Girls from Jodhpur and Udaipur of Rajasthan are sent to Delhi and Mumbai respectively and are forced into prostitution, the HC said. There is a likelihood of missing children from Telangana being sent to Kolkata via Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Chattisgarh, the bench observed.

Statistics suggest that nearly half of the missing children were girls. Referring to the different possibilities of where the missing children would be landing, the bench noted that teenaged boys from States on the borders can be lured by terror outfits and sent back to attack their own country.

Lawyer Ravi Chandra brought to the notice of the court that already a PIL petition filed by voluntary organisation Prajwala on trafficking of girls was pending with the HC. The bench directed the Registry to tag that plea with the present PIL petition.

The bench sought to know what was the State government’s rehabilitation policy of traced missing children.

He also submitted letters seeking release of funds, sanction of schemes, approvals.

In a meeting with the Union Minister, Mr. Venkat Reddy urged the Centre to sanction ₹1,028 crore for construction of permanent buildings for hospital of medical college of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Bibinagar. On the ITIR Hub sanctioned in 2008 by the previous UPA government, he stated that no effort had been made by the Centre to establish the sanctioned hub even 11 years after the announcement.

Although the Telangana government had been pursuing the issue with the NDA government, no action had been taken yet. He expressed hope that the Centre would recognise the emergence of Hyderabad as the second top hub of IT exports and the establishment of ITIR would further boost the industry.

Explaining that handloom weavers in his constituency were facing challenges with technology upgradation, product diversification and design development to suit the current market trends, the MP pointed out that most of the weavers were moving away from the profession due to lack of modern dyeing facilities and others. Stating that there was a need to protect hereditary artistic skills of weavers in the area, Mr. Venkat Reddy said it needed support from the government.

He stated that the world famous Pochampally “tie and dye” variety of silk sarees, dress material, furnishings were woven by the weavers of his constituency and there were 7,318 handloom weavers and 14,636 handloom ancillary workers had their livelihoods based on the profession. He requested the Union Minister to sanction block level clusters under the National Handloom Development Programme (NHDP) to enable product diversification, revival of languishing weaves and to do value addition.

Mr. Venkat Reddy requested the Union Minister to release ₹1,013 crore under NHDP to seven handloom clusters with over 4,500 looms.

Further, he requested the Centre to give financial approval for developmental works of NH-163, introduction of health insurance scheme exclusively for handloom weavers by including the weavers in the age group of 18 to 70 years and allocation of funds for cleaning of Musi river on the lines of Namami Gange programme.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/pfoq6t/article30496928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy07nirmala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bhongir-mp-urges-centre-to-sanction-funds-for-aiims-bibinagar-itir/article30496929.ece

293,2020/01/06,MAA accepts actor Rajasekhar’s resignation,"The executive committee of Movie Artists’ Association (MAA) accepted the resignation of actor Rajasekhar, three days after he created ‘ruckus’ and turned in his papers.

Committee members of MAA, the governing body of Telugu film industry, held an emergency meeting on Saturday and unanimously resolved to constitute a disciplinary and reconciliation committee to preside over the affairs of the association.

Further, they have appointed ‘Rebel Star’ Krishnam Raju as the chief advisor and actors Chiranjeevi, Mohan Babu and Jayasudha Kapoor as its members.

On Thursday, Dr. Rajasekhar snatched the microphone from writer Paruchuri Gopala Krishna and spoke about his ongoing tussle with MAA at an event organised to launch the 2020 diary of the association.

“My family life and health are totally disturbed because of the association politics. These are responsible for my recent car accident too,” Dr. Rajasekhar said, adding that there were several issues that need to be addressed.

Disciplinary action

Actors Mohan Babu and Jayasudha tried to interrupt him, but to no avail. Later, he left the stage, following which Chiranjeevi, who was visibly upset with Rajasekhar’s behaviour, openly condemned him and said that strong disciplinary action should be taken against him by the association. “The disciplinary committee should take a strong action,” he said.

“Any issues between members of MAA should be figured out internally, but one should not take them to the media or talk in public,” the Gharana Mogudu actor said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sn8t87/article30491419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06RAJSEAJR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/maa-accepts-actor-rajasekhars-resignation/article30491420.ece
294,2020/01/06,Fire stations at four govt. hospitals soon,"Presence of fire engines and fire personnel at four major government hospitals in the city would soon become a reality.

A proposal by the Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services department to establish fire stations at the hospitals was approved by the State Health department. This was the brainchild of Fire department officials, as finding space in the city has become an almost impossible task.

The temporary fire stations would come up at Niloufer Hospital, Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), Osmania General Hospital and Gandhi Hospital, where there is ample open space available, in a few weeks.

Officials said that it was a win-win situation for them as the fire department wants to reduce the response time to distress calls. This will also act as a confidence-booster for patients and hospitals’ staff, they said.

In a city where even a small parcel of land is dotted with houses and commercial establishments, locating space for fire stations is very difficult. Though the State government has sanctioned a fire station at Yakutpura, officials failed to find space for the past six months, an official said.

While assessing fire safety measures at government hospitals, the Fire department officials came up with the idea of setting up fire stations at the government hospitals. The proposal was then discussed by the heads of departments.

Director General of the Fire Services department Sanjay Kumar Jain said that initially, hospitals would provide temporary structures for the fire stations.

“We will send a proposal to the State government to approve permanent stations,” Mr. Jain said.

Some fire stations in the city house two fire engines. One of them would be allotted to the hospitals, he said. Fire department officials held three to four meetings with special chief secretary of the Health department A. Santhi Kumari in this regard.

“In case of any eventuality, the response time will be minimum as we will have in-house fire station. Besides, fire fighters can regularly inspect the measures taken in the government hospitals,” said director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy. They would also train the hospital staff.

Regional Fire Officer (central region) V. Papaiah said that they have identified the vehicles and the work force. “We will start working as soon as temporary sheds for fire engines and accommodation for our staff are provided,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fr0zal/article30488561.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-FIRE-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/fire-stations-at-four-govt-hospitals-soon/article30488560.ece
295,2020/01/06,Hospital fire safety move gathers steam,"After several years of delay, the process of providing fire fighting equipment to government hospitals has gained momentum.

Several fire mishaps at Gandhi Hospital and OGH, among others, have triggered fear among the hospital heads as the equipment needed to put off fire is either not available or stolen from the premises. This puts the lives of patients, attendants and doctors at risk.

The issue was highlighted in these columns earlier. The hospitals’ superintendents have earlier written to higher officials pointing out how lack of resources could lead to tragedy.

State Health officials, who have been pursuing a solution, gave an impetus to their efforts in the past few months. They passed a list of 126 hospitals that come under DME, and Telangana Vaidya Vidhana Parishad, to the Fire department.

V. Papaiah said that they divided the 126 hospitals into four categories: Hospitals spread in: Only ground floor; G+1, G+2, G+3; G+4 and in 15 metres and above height buildings. The fire safety measures at all the hospitals were assessed and a report submitted to the health department and later, to the TS Medical Services and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TSMIDC).

“We are in the final stages of drawing estimates,” said managing director of TSMIDC K. Chandrasekhar Reddy.

299,2020/01/06,When ophthalmologists saw the world through Braille,"In a paradox of sorts, ophthalmologists in the city on Sunday took part in a workshop led by visually challenged children. They taught the doctors how they saw the world through Braille and how they utilised modern technology to be part of mainstream society.

Emotional session

The session turned out to be an emotional experience for the doctors as they stepped into the world of visually challenged persons, understanding orientation and mobility after being blindfolded, and getting the first lessons of Braille from the teachers and students of School for the Blind, Aluva, a Government-aided school run by the Kerala Blind School Society.

The workshop was organised by the Cochin Ophthalmic Club (COC) to mark World Braille Day on Sunday.

As Aibin C. Thomas, Manoj R. and Govind T.R., students of Class 7 demonstrated their ability to use modern gadgets such as smartphones and laptops to communicate, the audience was overwhelmed by the number of applications available on computers that aided the visually challenged.

Sunil Francis, a teacher at the School for the Blind, told The Hindu that modern technology had given the children vast choices to select their mode of learning. While the children learn all the concepts and Braille reading and writing till Class 7 at the special school, from Class 8 onwards, they join regular schools for integrated education.

COC president S.J. Sai Kumar told The Hindu that while the treatment of eye disorders was their forte, ophthalmologists had little idea about the rehabilitation of those patients for whom there was no cure.

“Ophthalmology as a science is not involved in how the visually challenged get back into the society. We thought of learning through a workshop and Braille Day was a starting point,” he said.

As part of COC’s programmes, rehabilitation of the visually challenged would be taken up as a priority.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ad1fwy/article30488876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05kithOphthalmologyBraille2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/when-ophthalmologists-saw-the-world-through-braille/article30488877.ece
300,2020/01/06,"At Maradu, apartments being readied for demolition","With pre-demolition work, including the loading of explosives, having been completed at H2O Holy Faith apartment and the work at other apartments nearing completion, officials have embarked on a confidence-building mission among the residents of Maradu.

Squads of government officials, including the staff of Maradu municipality, will reach out to people from Monday onwards to clear their doubts regarding personal safety and that of buildings located near the apartments.

A detailed note on possible questions and apprehensions that could be raised during the public interaction is being prepared. The officials will explain the process of demolition and the safety measures, including the identification of exclusion zones notified around the four apartments.

The officials will assure the people that there is no scope for worry and that all precautionary measures, including a contingency plan, have been finalised. Medical facilities available at local hospitals will be utilised. Four ambulances would be readied on the days of demolition and the Maradu municipality office would function as the control room for the demolition, said a senior functionary of the local body.

Filling explosives

Meanwhile, explosive experts said the apartment, H2O Holy Faith, had been readied for the demolition with explosive material filled in all the 1,471 holes that were drilled into the structure. It was estimated that 215 kg of explosive materials and 15,000 metres of detonating fuse would be required for razing the apartment complex, said R. Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives.

The covering of the building using geo-textiles has also been completed and floors cleaned. Instructions were also issued to improve the safety of a nearby building by adding one more layer of metal sheet fencing. Currently, there are five layers of fencing. The layer being added would have a height of 2.1 metre, he said.

At Jain Coral Cove, primary blasting will take place at the ground floor, mezzanine, the first, eight and 14th floors and secondary explosions at the fifth and 11th floors. About 395 kg of explosives may be required there. In the case of Alfa Serene, steps were being taken to reduce the quantity of explosives used, said Dr. Venugopal.

The covering of the pipelines of petroleum companies laid in the area has been completed.

The Maradu municipality has asked local residents and other occupants of buildings in the areas to move to the rehabilitation centres before 9 a.m. on the days of the blast as a precautionary measure.

The apartments H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene will be demolished on January 11 from 11 a.m. The original schedule was to trigger the first implosion by 11.30 a.m.

The district administration has marked 200-metre areas from the boundary of these buildings as exclusion zones.

302,2020/01/06,Deal soon for biomining of legacy waste,"The Kochi Corporation is likely to sign an agreement by the second week of January for carrying out biomining of the legacy waste piling up at the Brahmapuram waste dumping yard.

The council has approved the vendor and the work order will be issued without delay. The agency selected has claimed to have prior experience in handling biomining projects in Tamil Nadu, according to a senior official of the civic body.

The Corporation had to re-tender the work after there were no takers in the initial round. It had no option but to speed up the process as the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had in November asked the Secretary of the Kochi Corporation to specify why the direction of the Principal Bench of the tribunal on disposal of legacy waste by biomining and bioremediation in the dumping grounds applying Indore model had not been complied with by the authorities. It had also asked the civic body to elaborate on steps taken for disposal of legacy waste in a scientific manner.

The Indore model refers to a successful initiative carried out by the Indore municipal corporation to clear thousands of tonnes of garbage in an 100-acre landfill through biomining.

Wet and hazardous waste was segregated at houses and deposited in separate bins as part of the project. It was then placed in front of each house during collection time. Vehicles were tracked from a central control room, and bins provided in the GPS-fitted vehicle for collection of segregated waste. The collection vehicles were automatically weighed at transfer station for daily collection of wet and dry waste separately. The data was generated at the control room. The waste generated was collected and treated on the same day itself.

The Indore authorities were able to clear 100 acres of land filled with garbage within six months.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/deal-soon-for-biomining-of-legacy-waste/article30488817.ece
303,2020/01/06,No deadline for imposing penalty: KSPCB,"Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) is not under any political or administrative pressure to delay the imposition of environment compensation on Kochi Corporation and five municipalities in Ernakulam, according to Chairman Ajit Haridas.

“We will proceed with all necessary legal action to enforce Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. But we cannot set any time limit to initiate the action,” he told The Hindu, when asked why the board was soft-pedalling on slapping environment compensation on the Kochi Corporation and Aluva, Angamaly, Thrikkakara, Thripunithura and Maradu municipalities. The Board members had passed a no-confidence motion against the chairman for imposing a penalty of ₹14.5 crore on the CPI(M)-ruled Thiruvananthapuram Corporation before the bypoll held in Vattiyoorkavu.

KSPCB had issued notices on October 12 last year under Section 5 of the Environmental Protection Act, 1986 to Kochi Corporation and six civic bodies, including Kalamassery municipality, asking why environment compensation should not be recovered for not providing bio-methanation plant for the food waste generated in the civic bodies.

The civic bodies were given 15 days for submitting its reply to the notices issued by KSPCB. It had imposed penalty of ₹2.47 crore on Kalamassery municipality alone as a follow-up action while the proceedings against the rest were pending for the last two-and-a-half months.

The board’s regional office in Ernakulam had submitted a report in which it had assessed an environment compensation of ₹10.05 crore on Kochi corporation for its failure to comply with Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, at its Brahmapuram facility. The assessment period was from April 9, 2019 to October-end.

However, KSPCB issued an environment compensation of ₹1.2 crore on the civic body in December for its failure to set up a leachate treatment facility at Brahmapuram.

Treating food waste

Mr. Haridas said the Board would proceed with the process of recovering environment compensation from the erring civic bodies in Ernakulam, if they failed to install anaerobic digester to treat food waste. The civic bodies were told to submit a detailed action plan explaining the steps to be taken for treatment of food waste. If the reply was not satisfactory, the Board would definitely proceed against the civic bodies, he said.

The chairman said that setting up an anaerobic digester at Brahmapuram was essential, considering the huge quantities of food waste reaching the site.

“The Corporation has to set up an anaerobic digester despite the proposal to have a waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram. The new facility will not be able to treat such huge quantities of legacy waste lying there,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/no-deadline-for-imposing-penalty-kspcb/article30488801.ece
304,2020/01/06,JNU violence: Mamata terms it a ‘fascist surgical strike’,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday described the violence in the Jawaharlal National University (JNU) on Sunday as a “fascist surgical strike” and urged students to “unite and fight together against the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre”.

The attack was a “dangerous planned attack on democracy”, she said. “They are torturing the professors also. It is disturbing not only for me but for all.” Such a development had never occurred in the country. “While they send the goons of the BJP, they kept the police inactive.” As someone who started her political life as a student leader, she understood the issues relating to student politics, the Trinamool Congress chairperson told journalists.

As it happened: Masked goons strike terror in JNU, none arrested

“In a democracy, governments will come and go but they will have to work under the Constitution. One does not have the right to do whatever they think only because they have majority,” she noted.

On Sunday night, Ms. Banerjee condemned the “brutality unleashed against students/ teachers in JNU”. A Trinamool Congress delegation, led by former Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi, was going to Delhi to show solidarity with the JNU, she said.

BJP hits back at CM

Meanwhile, State BJP president Dilip Ghosh questioned Ms. Banerjee’s silence when Union Minister Babul Supriyo was heckled at the Jadavpur University or when State Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar faced protests at the varsity.

305,2020/01/06,"Udayan, NGO made famous by Steve Waugh, hits a rough patch","Udayan, the NGO that works for leprosy-affected children and earned countrywide popularity because of Australian cricketer Steve Waugh’s association with it, is running out of funds.

So bad is the situation that the institution, founded in 1970 by Englishman James Stevens, nearly closed down about three years ago but managed to keep itself afloat with help from SBI Life Insurance and ad hoc donations.

“We don’t know where the next money is going to come from,” Udayan chairperson Emily R. Menon told The Hindu. “We are desperately looking for local support. Kolkata is a prosperous city, I am sure it has enough companies that can help us, considering that CSR is now mandatory.”

“This is happening at a time when leprosy is once again on the rise, contrary to the belief that it has been eliminated. As many as 71% of leprosy cases worldwide are reported from India,” she said.

What has obviously gone against Udayan, based at Barrackpore near Kolkata, is the perception that it is always cash-rich, thanks to high-profile donors such as the French writer Dominique Lapierre and also Steve Waugh. But Mr. Lapierre has been in coma after he suffered a fall in 2012 and the donations from him — which were substantial — have completely dried up.

Mr. Waugh, on the other hand, is responsible for the education and training of only 60 of the 100 girls at Udayan and donates about ₹25 lakh a year. “Whereas our annual budget is about ₹1.8 crore,” said Ms. Menon. “While Mr. Waugh is doing a great job, we obviously need more funds. Our capacity is for 300 children, but right now we house only 260 (160 boys, 100 girls) because we cannot afford to have more.”

The former Australian cricket captain became associated with Udayan in the late 1990s after a meeting with Mother Teresa inspired him to do charity work. “Udayan feels like a second home,” the former cricketer, who was “Steve da” to the boys there, had said.

But that was then. Father Stevens, the founder of Udayan, died on Easter Sunday last year. His death largely went unnoticed, even though countless stigmatised children from the slums of Kolkata — either suffering from leprosy themselves or having parents affected by it — benefited from the childhood-to-livelihood scheme of his NGO.

At the moment, Udayan has seven children undergoing treatment for leprosy and about 35 who are under observation. “This year, we intend to start a fresh community outreach programme because there is a huge need for outreach, considering that leprosy is once again on the rise. But we need local support,” Ms. Menon said. “Ad hoc donations alone won’t do. We need sustained funding.”",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/article17404656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04WAUGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/udayan-ngo-made-famous-by-steve-waugh-is-running-out-of-funds/article30492312.ece

Addressing the media here on Monday, Mr. Vasu said that in the past several political clashes had taken place outside the temple, but this is the first time such a violent attack occurring on the temple premises.

Mr. Vasu said the attackers also took away some gold and silver ornaments and ₹50,000 from the temple office. The police have registered a case and started investigation in this regard.

Mr. Vasu said earlier the RSS used to conduct martial training sessions near the temple.

Meanwhile, BJP district general secretary K. K. Vinod said that the party was not involved in the attack. He alleged that a gang led by Anand was involved in several clashes in the past.

A group of applicants has claimed that the notification does not specify the reservation categories of posts in each department, but considers the university as a whole unit. It becomes difficult for the applicants to know if they are eligible for a particular post.

Some others have issues with the age limit prescribed in the notification too, which is 40 years as on January 1, 2020. They point out that normally the age limit is given on a preceding date, and it should have been January 1, 2019. The applicants claim that the notification issued by the Kerala Public Service Commission for the post of Assistant Professors in December had set the ceiling on January 1, 2019. The Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit too had followed a similar method, they claim.

The applicants also dispute the university authorities’ claim that the notification for appointments was being issued after a gap of a decade.

They claim that a similar notification was issued in May, 2015, and before that too. Though the university had conducted interviews in June 2015, the appointment was postponed.

The sum of ₹2,000 collected from the applicants as fee had not been refunded, they claim.

The Calicut University Teachers’ Association (CUTA) objected to the move soon after the Syndicate announced its decision claiming that it was not proper to fill such large number of posts when the university is awaiting the appointment of a Vice Chancellor, who is the chairman of the selection committee.

Right now, V. Anil Kumar, Vice Chancellor, Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, is holding additional charge.

The CUTA also alleged that a Left-leaning staff union was trying to influence the appointment process. T.M. Vasudevan, president, CUTA, sent a letter to Arif Mohammed Khan, Governor and Chancellor, urging him to issue a direction to Mr. Anil Kumar until a full-time VC is appointed.

The university authorities, however, claim that they were following an order of the Kerala High Court on reservation. The norms would be followed after the preparation of the rank list and at the time of appointment.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/row-over-calicut-varsity-teachers-appointment/article30488879.ece
309,2020/01/06,Erring contractors warned of action,"Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran on Sunday said strict action would be taken against contractors who had not completed construction works in a timely manner.

He was speaking after inaugurating the work on Vannathikadavu bridge.

“Action will be taken against contractors including the revocation of licence,” the Minister said. There would also be action against engineers who fail in their duty, he added

Mr. Sudhakaran said that he had noticed that in Kannur time-bound work had not been carried out due to the failure of contractors. The matter would be looked into, he added.

Currently, 464 bridges were being constructed in the State. Over 100 bridges had been inaugurated, he said. “The Government has sanctioned ₹8.49 crore for the construction of a new bridge at Vannathikadavu. Built in 1963 on the Pilathara —Mathamangalam road, the existing bridge is narrow and it is difficult for vehicles to pass through. The long-pending need for a new bridge will become a reality now,” he said.

The new bridge will be 140-metres long and 11-metres wide. The function was chaired by T.V. Rajesh, MLA.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday granted anticipatory bail to two Tamil journalists who were booked for interviewing inmates of a Sri Lankan refugee camp in Kanniyakumari district on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Justice G.R. Swaminathan granted anticipatory bail to R. Sindhu and R. Ram Kumar, journalists with Tamil magazine ‘Junior Vikatan’. The duo apprehended arrest by Kanniyakumari district police after two cases were booked against them under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code.

Thousands of devotees thronged Vaishnavite temples across Madurai on Monday, on the occasion of ‘Vaikunta Ekadasi’.

The opening of the ‘Paramapada Vasal’ on the Ekadasi day of the Tamil month of Margazhi is the highlight of the 21-day Vaikunta Ekadasi festival.

Thousands of devotees were waiting in long queues at Prasanna Venkatachalapathy Temple at Tallakulam at 4.50 a.m. to catch a glimpse of the Lord being taken out in procession after the opening of the ‘Paramapadha Vasal’. The main deity, Prasanna Venkatachalapathy, was decked up with flowers and jewellery and carried out by the devotees and temple priests amidst chanting of hymns and prayers.

Similarly, hundreds of devotees witnessed the opening of ‘Paramapadha Vasal’ at Lord Kallazhagar Temple in Alagarkovil at 5.10 a.m.

At Koodal Azhagar Perumal Temple in the city, the ‘Paramapadha Vasal’ was opened at 7.15 p.m. A large number of devotees gathered at the temple to witness the event.

312,2020/01/06,Tirunelveli Corporation wields ‘green power’,"Tirunelveli Corporation has installed solar power panels on its buildings at a cost of ₹1.87 crore, the civic body chief, G. Kannan, said on Monday.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Kannan said the Corporation, by installing the solar power panels, would generate ‘green power’ to meet its demands and sell the surplus to Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco).

While the solar panels would largely meet the Corporation’s demand by generating electricity during shiny days, the surplus power sold to Tangedco would ensure additional revenue.

And the revenue would help meet the demand of the Corporation during monsoon.

The urban civic body, having 1,54,808 houses, was generating 170 tonnes of garbage a day, including 107 tonnes of degradable waste and 63 tonnes of non-degradable garbage being collected separately, thanks to source segregation at primary level by sanitary workers in 270 battery-operated vehicles.

At the secondary level, garbage being dumped in 485 bins were being collected and taken to Ramaiyanpatti garbage yard in 21 vehicles everyday.

Since 2.02 lakh cubic meter garbage dumped in the yard had been compacted in just 4.50 acres and closed scientifically, wherein grass was grown over the waste compacted and closed with polythene sheets, the degradable waste now being collected in the city was being converted into manure in 40 micro compost centres established in various parts of the city.

“We’ve so far given 2.75 lakh tonnes of manure to 142 farmers and to over 1,000 home gardens free of cost. Now, we have have decided to collect ₹2 per kg manure as the amount would be given to the workers as incentive. The more they produce the more they would get. So, in order to encourage the workers to produce more manure, we are planning to collect the small amount from buyers,” Mr. Kannan said.

On the ban on use-and-throw plastic waste, the Commissioner said civic personnel, through surprise checks in 14,500 business establishments, seized 4,890 kg of plastic products and slapped a fine of ₹16.55 lakh for violation.

The anti-dengue operations initiated by the Corporation had drastically curtailed the prevalence of the vector-borne disease in the city despite active monsoon. As raids were conducted on every Thursday in houses, hospitals, hotels, hostels, schools, colleges and other places, those who were responsible for providing mosquito breeding grounds were fined to the tune of ₹8.83 lakh.

Moreover, dumping of garbage in public places and smoking in public places too attracted fines to the tune of ₹57,100.

Every household within the jurisdiction of Tirunelveli Corporation would get underground drainage connection by 2022 as the second and third phases of the project were being implemented under AMRUT Scheme (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation) on an outlay of ₹490 crore. The project would be completed within next three years.

“Once the scheme is completed, the Tamirabharani, lifeline of southern districts, will not get polluted even as it crosses Tirunelveli city,” Mr. Kannan said.

Work on a truck terminal being established under the Smart City programme on an outlay of ₹14.67 crore had almost been completed and, hence, the facility would become operational soon.

The Commissioner said the underground drainage scheme, which benefited 25,000 houses after completion of the first phase, would be taken to the remaining houses in the second and the third phase of the project, which would be completed in 2022.

When election for 3,537 posts in rural local bodies in the district was notified, 1,094 village panchayat ward members, 34 village panchayat presidents and a panchayat union ward member were elected unopposed, while no nomination was received for seven village panchayat wards.

As the elected representatives were asked to assume office on Monday, district panchayat councillors took oath in the presence of Collector Sandeep Nanduri at the Collectorate. Oath taking ceremonies were organised in all 12 panchayat unions of the district.

Officials said all 403 village panchayat presidents and 2,925 village panchayat ward members took the oath in the presence of the Assistant Returning Officers.

Election of the vice-president of village panchayats, chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of panchayat unions and the district panchayat would be held on January 11.

When independent candidates Ramar of Ward 14 of Kovilpatti panchayat union and Senthil Murugan of Ward 17, who supported the DMK-led alliance, boarded a van parked outside the panchayat union office after taking oath, AIADMK cadre, led by party’s Kovilpatti town secretary Vijayapandian, blocked the vehicle saying the DMK was taking them forcibly.

However, police, after speaking with Mr. Ramar and Mr. Senthil Murugan, allowed them to go in the van as they were convinced that they had not been abducted.

However, the AIADMK functionaries reiterated their charge against the DMK and blocked vehicular traffic on Ettaiyapuram Road for about 30 minutes.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/new-local-body-members-take-oath/article30496219.ece

Narayanan Nair said.

Addressing reporters here on Monday, he said the ongoing reconstruction of the bus stand had picked-up after clearing initial hurdles such as profuse seepage of water due to recent rain and the legal impediments caused by a few traders who had their shops in the bus stand complex.

‘Stay orders cleared’

“The bottlenecks, including a few stay orders obtained from the court by tenants of the bus,stand building against demolition orders, have been cleared, and reconstruction work has picked up momentum. Hence, operation of buses from the bus stand will resume before December-end,” he said.

Basement parking and ground level bus bays would be ready before December-end so that the buses now being operated from the temporary bus stand at Exhibition Grounds could be operated from the bus stand even as work on the first and the second floors would continue.

The Smart City Board of Directors had approved 19 more development works, costing ₹310.64 crore, under the Centre-funded Smart City project to be executed at a total cost of ₹990 crore to be implemented in Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai in addition to the projects already approved by the Board.

Sewage treatment

One of the projects cleared by the Board was expected to put an end to complaints on discharge of partially treated sewage into irrigation channel from the sewage ponds at Ramaiyanpatti, where underground sewage of the city was being collected in open ponds to be treated naturally.

“A sewage treatment plant with a capacity of 58 million litres per day, adopting batch reactor method, will be established at Ramaiyanpatti compost yard on an outlay of ₹60 crore. This plant will treat the sewage and cent per cent treated water will be released from the plant, which can be used for irrigation,” Dr. Nair said.

A candidate who had contested for the post of Koorakundu Panchayat 8th ward member, Saravanan, has complained of foul play in declaration of result after two candidates got identical 183 votes.

Saravanan raised a banner of revolt claiming that the Returning Officer for Virudhunagar Panchayat Union, Kaja Mohideen, had given the certificate of victory to the other candidate, Ramamoorthi, without a draw of lots.

Saravanan who came to the Union Office threatened to immolate himself on Monday evening. However, the police prevented him.

Among the three candidates, Saravanan and Ramamoorthi had got same number of votes of 183. Saravanan claimed that after the counting of votes was completed, the BDO had asked them to come to the Union Office on Monday for the draw of lots. However, when he went there on Monday, he learnt that the other candidate had been given the certificate of victory.

“We did not get any complaint regarding this issue for three days after the counting of votes got completed on Friday. When we tried to contact the BDO today to clarify, we were told that he suffered a heart attack on Saturday and was hospitalised and hence could not enquire him,” the Collector, R. Kannan, said.

The genuineness of the complaint of Saravanan could be verified only after enquiring the BDO, he said.

Meanwhile, Saravanan, along with supporters, was staging a protest at Allampatti.

The request for ambulance came from Tamil Nadu Railway Police at around 2 p.m. The police said an unidentified person was dead after being hit by a train.

An ambulance rushed to the spot, and when the workers lifted the body they found that the victim was very much alive. The man had only fallen unconscious.

“When the railway gate keeper found a man lying along the track with injuries on his right hand and leg, he mistook that he was dead and alerted the police,” a worker said. The police, in turn, called the ambulance.

318,2020/01/06,Online sale of cardamom touches a new high,"BODI

The sale price of cardamom at a new high of ₹ 7,000 per kg through online has come as a good news to the growers at the beginning of the new year - 2020 here on Monday, officials at the online marketing centre here said.

Since the last quarter in 2019, when the harvest in many of the cardamom estates in neighbouring Kerala was under way, the sale price was revolving around ₹2,500 and ₹3,000. As the supply of cardamom dwindled post-harvest season, the fag end of last year (around December) saw a demand for the produce due to festivals such as Christmas, New Year celebrations and Pongal.

Utilising the seasonal demand, the cardamom growers appeared to be in an upbeat mood. However, according to the officials, the price moved a little higher and settled at ₹ 3,804 on December 31, 2019.

Again, on January 1, it slipped to ₹ 3,756 per kg. Subsequently, the price moved up and down around ₹3,862 and ₹ 3,885 in the following two days.

On January 4 (Saturday), there was 288 bags of cardamom weighing 61,775 kg for sale online. Based on the quality of the produce, it touched a new high at ₹ 7,000 per kilo and the average price settled at ₹ 4,015 per kg.

Again in another sale of 300 bags weighing 67,999 kg, the officials at the auction centre said that 65,556 kg of cardamom, which was meant for sale online, the highest bid was recorded at ₹4,610 and the average price was at ₹ 4,097 per kg.

According to some of the cardamom growers and farmers, the new high of ₹ 7,000 per kg could not be said to be a boon.

“In 2019, there was drought until mid-July and subsequently, the monsoon rains led to floods. Thus, dry spell prevailed for the first six months and subsequently, when we made use of the monsoon, heavy rains, which lashed the fields, led to a complete washout. Thus, on an average, there was a dip in production by 40%,” they said.

The price in 2019 was revolving around ₹ 1,800 and ₹ 2,000 per kg and it had doubled now due to a shortfall in the commodity. People, who managed to stock, may benefit now through online sale, the growers said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/online-sale-of-cardamom-touches-a-new-high/article30495249.ece

320,2020/01/06,SC people demand inclusion in jallikattu committee,"MADURAI

A section of Scheduled Caste people from Palamedu, one of the main places in Madurai where the traditional Tamil sport is organised every year, have demanded inclusion of their representatives in the committee that organises jallikattu. Otherwise, they have said, the government must organise the bull-taming event in the village.

The villagers petitioned Collector T.G. Vinay with this demand on Monday.

S. Santhanam, a villager, said since the 1960s the committee had been dominated by caste Hindus. “Jallikattu is a major ‘festival’ of our village. Every year, bulls reared by our community people and bull tamers from our community also take part in the event. But, we have always been excluded from the organising committee,” he said.

Jallikattu was a common festival of the village and there must be no discrimination based on caste or religion, said M. Kumar, another member of the community. “Apart from organising jallikattu, the committee members misuse and wield their power in other affairs of the village too,” he charged.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/sc-people-demand-inclusion-in-jallikattu-committee-madurai/article30494838.ece
321,2020/01/06,Well-timed swara enthrals audience at music festival,"The second day’s concert at the 68th anniversary celebration of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam here on Friday was that of Ramakrishnan Murthy to the accompaniment of V. S. Gokul on the violin, N.C. Bharadwaj on the mrudangam and S. Krishnasamy on the ghatam.

He started off with Pacchimiriyam Adiyappa’s Bhairavi Raaga Varnam ‘Virboni.’ Then he went to his next rendition, ‘Tatvam ariya taramaa,’ in Reethigowlai by Papanasam Sivan, in which Sivan explains his difficulty in understanding the greatness and significance of Lord Ganapati. This set the pace of the concert.

His next rendition was ‘Seethamma Mayamma’ by saint-composer Thyagarajar in Raga Vasanta, in which the saint salutes Sita as his mother and Rama as his father and all bagavathas as his relatives. Neelakanta Sivan’s Mukhari raga kriti ‘Endraiku Siva kripai varumo,’ was sung with due effect of the raga and filled with a mix of sorrow, devotion and introspection.

Kamakshi, who illuminates the abode of Ekambaranatha, was worshipped through ‘Kanchadayala dakshi’ in Kamalamanohari by Muthusamy Dikshidar. It was sung with full alapana with the pace the lyric requires, with the emphasis on describing the eyes of the Goddess. The raga of the kriti was brought out beautifully. The swara exercises were well-timed and appealing with equal support from violinist Gokul.

The audience was highly appreciative of the Tani performance of percussionists Bharadwaj on the mridangam and Krishnasamy on the ghatam.

Madhyamavathi ragam, a raga suitable for elaboration and exploration, was well sung for ‘Palinchu Kamatchi’ by Shyama Sastry. In Mazhavai Chidambara Bharathi’s ‘Poomel valarum Annaiye’ in Anandha Bhairavi on the presiding deity of Madurai Goddess Meenakshi, the singer wonderfully described Madhurapuri – the city of nectar.

In the RTP, Ramakrishnamurthy’s versatility was on show. He virtually went through a raga tour of Bahudari, Hamsanandani, Saveri and Kambhoji for the Pallavi.

The concluding part of the concert witnessed a Virturam in Kandar Anubhuthi for ‘Ganamrutha panam’ by Koteeswara Iyer in Raga Jyotiswaroopini, Adum Chidambaramo by Gopalakrishna Bharathi and a Thillana.

The rasikas’ interest was kept alive throughout the concert with a confident and planned presentation.

324,2020/01/06,Teppakulam could well become Madurai’s Marina,"Marina beach in Chennai is always crowded. The ebb and flow of waves, the strong sea breeze, the soft sand - they bring joy to the old and the young alike.

This is something amiss in a city like Madurai, far away from the sea. Even Madurai’s lifeline, Vaigai river, is dry for most part of the year. The stench of sewage let into the river keeps residents away from the river.

But all is not lost. This city has a sprawling water tank, the Mariamman Teppakulam. Concerted efforts by different government agencies have helped in storage of a huge quantum of water in it, lately. Now the brimming water is attracting people of all ages. The still waters add to January’s nip in the air. The reflection of the lights all around the vast expanse of the calm waters add to the charm at night. With vendors on carts and bicycles selling a variety of food and beverages, Teppakulam has become the perfect spot for an unhurried evening for harried souls.

Reversal of follies

Like the Vaigai, the temple tank also used to remain dry for most part of the year and on many years there was either no water or very less of it during the float festival. It was all due to man’s greed, resulting in indiscriminate lifting of sand that left the Vaigai riverbed lower than the level of Panaiyur channel that takes the river water to the tank.

Eventually, Panaiyur channel turned into a carrier of sewage due to apathetic authorities. Just when people resigned to the fact that the Teppakulam will remain barren forever, a good thing has happened. A PWD engineer says, “All that we have done now is reversal of man-made follies by raising the water level in Vaigai river with a check dam that has allowed natural flow of water into Panaiyur channel again.”

Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan says, “From the Corporation side, we constructed a link channel from the sluice of the new check dam constructed across the Vaigai near Albert Victor bridge to lift water from the river to Panaiyur channel. Our men toiled for days to desilt the sewage filled channel before allowing clean water into the tank.” With the sewage flow into the channel arrested, it is ready to take the Vaigai waters to Teppakulam whenever there is flow in the river.

All these years, Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple authorities would pump water using motors to fill the tank over a course of several weeks. “But we filled it to its brim in just two weeks,” the PWD engineer says.

A different world

“Earlier, the sewage-mixed water emanated stench. It kept away the regulars who took a walk around the dry tank. But, this time, we are enjoying the fresh water,” says C. Alaguraja, 61, of nearby Anna Nagar. He is part of a group of old men who visit the temple tank every evening for over a decade. “During summer, we used to sit on the tank bed to enjoy the breeze,” says M. Thangaiah.

Hundreds of men and women use the four streets around the tank for their morning and evening strolls. Come weekends and holidays, the crowd swells with a good number of children. As the filling of the tank coincided with Christmas holidays, it attracted more crowd.

The temple authorities have put in place iron fences to close the padithurai’s (fleet of steps) as a precautionary measure. The stone walls serve as a good seating arrangement.

“The tank with brimming water has made a huge difference to this place. It feels like a different world altogether,” says Mr. Alaguraja. Regular visitors are all praise for the efforts of the authorities. “We have streamlined parking of two-wheelers and cars by moving them to the outer periphery. We have also ensured cleanliness by deploying workers,” says Meenakshi Temple Executive Officer Natarajan.

“After the Corporation officials took action against eateries that dumped waste in and around the tank, the vendors have kept dustbins to prevent littering. Cleanliness has improved a lot,” says C. Mariappan, 47, who suggests iron mesh fencing for 10 feet around the tank to ensure safety and cleanliness.

Pointing to the water level dipping in the tank by over a foot in the last few days, Mr. Thangaiah says the groundwater in his house at nearby Adaikalam Pillai Colony has turned sweet from salty.

Mr. Natarajan, whose official quarters is also in the vicinity, says water level in the borewell has come up to 10 feet. “The overhead tanks fills up in no time these days,” he says. The temple plans to maintain at least 10 feet of water in the tank by continuous pumping of water from Vaigai river. It also plans to adopt bio-culture method to keep the water clean.

However, Balamurugan Kathiravan of Pankajam Colony complains that sand deposited around the tank should be removed.

The proximity of Teppakulam police station and frequent rounds made by the police have ensured safety for the visitors. “We’ve planned to shift all the eateries to one place for better maintenance of hygiene and cleanliness. We have also sought improvements to the tank and maiya mandapam that will reflect the heritage and temple architecture,” Mr. Natarajan says. Boating will be re-introduced after ensuring safety measures, considering the depth of water in the tank, he adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/h4d5nq/article30490778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06MACITY-TEPPAKULAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/teppakulam-could-well-become-madurais-marina/article30490779.ece
325,2020/01/06,Action against corrupt should not be seen as government crackdown on corporates: Modi,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said action against a few corrupt entities should not be seen as a government crackdown on the corporate sector, as he sought to allay doubts over his regime’s intentions.

Speaking at centenary celebrations of Kirloskar Brothers, he said the attempt was to allow the industry to create wealth fearlessly in a transparent environment where there are no obstacles.

In this endeavour, the government is attempting to rid the industry of a web of laws, the Prime Minister said, adding during the past five years his government has worked honestly.

The attempt has been to bring transparency, efficiency and accountability in tax system, and reduce human interface with the tax department, he said.

Also, corporate tax has been reduced to their lowest so as to propel corporates to invest, he said.

The Prime Minister asked industry to shun pessimism, saying the government will stand shoulder to shoulder with India Inc. in its attempt to expand business in any nook and corner of the country.

He said the target to nearly double the size of the economy to $5 trillion is just a phase and the targets are bigger and higher.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/wel4tm/article30495908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOFDIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/action-against-corrupt-should-not-be-seen-as-government-crackdown-on-corporates-modi/article30495909.ece
326,2020/01/06,IT firms may report muted Q3 growth,"Indian information technology (IT) firms are likely to start new year with a muted growth, when they announce their third quarter results following to a seasonally-weak quarter and continued challenges in the the banking, financial services and insurance (BSFI) and retail verticals.

Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro and Tech Mahindra are likely to report a tepid revenue growth in constant currency (cc) terms on a sequential basis with improved operating margins due to weaker currency and optimisation measures, according to analysts.

“We expect 0.7-3% Q-o-Q cc growth across top tier IT services companies in seasonally weak 3Q with Tech Mahindra leading helped by a ramp up of AT&T deal. We expect a slight sequential margin expansion in most cases with Infosys leading at over 50bps,” said Jefferies Equity Research.

Infosys will announce its third quarter results on Friday January 10, 2020 and the outcome of investigation into whistleblower complaints by law firm Amarchand Mangaldas will be eagerly anticipated.key to look out for.

TCS is expected to report its weakest Q-o-Q cc growth among top tier IT companies at 0.7% (1.4% in U.S. dollar growth) due to weakness in BFSI and client specific headwinds in retail, according to Jefferies, while for Infosys, it expects 0.8% Q-o-Q cc growth (1.1% U.S. dollar) in 3Q, meaning that YoY cc growth will fall just below 10% for the first time in five quarters.

“In a seasonally soft quarter, higher-than-usual furloughs and caution in key verticals (BFSI, retail) will create further overhang on growth, in our view,” Motilal Oswal wrote in a note.

According to Motilal Oswal, major currencies like pound, euro and Australian dollar appreciated (approximately 2%-7%) sequentially, resulting in a cross-currency tailwind of 20-150 basis points (bps). Only NIIT Tech should face a cross-currency headwinds of 110 bps.

TCS is yet to announce its board meeting to consider the third quarter results. However, the management of India’s largest IT firm is now relieved that former Tata Sons chairman Cyrus Mistry has decided not to seek directorship in the company.

TCS on Friday January 3, 2020 had filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order directing reinstatement of Mr. Cyrus Pallonji Mistry as director of the company for rest of the tenure.

However, Cyrus Mistry on Sunday January 5, 2020 in a statement titled, “Not a quest for position or power” said that he will not be pursuing the executive chairmanship of Tata Sons, or the directorship of TCS, Tata Teleservices or Tata Industries inspite of a favourable NCLAT judgement.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/j3xrvh/article30496605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07THBUINFOSYS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/it-firms-may-report-muted-q3-growth/article30496606.ece
327,2020/01/06,"Telecom firms want cut in rates, levies","Ahead of the Budget 2020-21, the telecom industry on Monday asked the government to facilitate funding for firms at a lower rate of interest, while also pushing for reduction in various levies and taxes to help the debt-ridden sector.

The demands were discussed at a meeting between the Department of Telecom and industry stakeholders on Monday. “We have heard their [industry’s] demands and have given time to send in written recommendations till Tuesday. We will then review and forward them to the Finance Ministry for consideration in the upcoming Budget,” a senior DoT official said after the meeting that lasted for about one-and-a half hours.

The pre-Budget meeting was chaired by Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash and attended by representatives of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio, besides industry associations such as Cellular Operators Association of India and Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association.

Reduction in USO

The official added that the industry representatives reiterated the earlier demand for reduction in universal service obligation (USO) fund to 3% and licence fee to 1% as well as refund of accumulated input tax credit. “They have also sought creation of a dedicated fund to be used by purchaser of telecom equipment to help promote Make in India,” the official said.

“We have requested the government to facilitate funding at lower rate of interest to telecom companies to reduce the overall cost of capital and mobilise cheaper funds. Telecom industry is capital-intensive... this will help us plough more funds into network upgradation, maintenance and expansion,” an industry representative said after the meeting.

Other industry representative added that the government had been requested to set up a working group with stakeholders from the DoT, regulator TRAI and industry that will work on preparing guidelines for adopting the principle of input line credit. The industry also pitched that telecom towers be included in the definition of plant and machinery for input tax credit.

328,2020/01/06,"Oil tops $70 as Iran, Trump trade threats","Oil prices jumped by about 1% on Monday, pushing Brent above $70 a barrel, as rhetoric from the United States, Iran and Iraq fanned tensions in West Asia after a U.S. air strike killed a top Iranian military commander.

Brent crude futures soared to a high of $70.74 a barrel and was at $69.36 by 8.30 p.m., up 76 cents from Friday’s settlement.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 54 cents at $63.59 a barrel after touching $64.72, its highest since April.

The gains extended Friday’s more-than-3% advance after a U.S. air strike in Iraq killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, heightening concerns about an escalation in conflict in West Asia and a possible impact on oil supplies.

The region accounts for nearly half of the world’s oil production, with a fifth of the world’s oil shipments passing through the Strait of Hormuz.

More sanctions on Iraq

U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday threatened to impose sanctions on Iraq, the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), if U.S. troops were forced to withdraw from the country.

Baghdad earlier called on U.S. and other foreign troops to leave Iraq.

Mr. Trump also said that the United States would retaliate against Iran if Tehran were to strike back after the killing.

“The situation brings lots of uncertainty and geopolitical tea-leaf reading on reactions. While the closure of the Strait of Hormuz remains a very unlikely event, the deterioration in Iraq bears supply risks,” said Norbert Rucker, head of economics at Swiss bank Julius Baer.

“Geopolitics tend to be a temporary force on oil markets and we believe this time is no different. We raise our near-term forecast to $65 per barrel and maintain a neutral view”.

The Economist Intelligence Unit raised its first-quarter projection for Brent by $5 to $70 a barrel, assessing that Iran is likely to want to avoid open conflict. “We maintain our forecast that the two countries are likely to avoid outright war. Iran is not in a position financially, after more than a year of crippling U.S. sanctions, to finance a lopsided war with the U.S.,” EIU global economist Cailin Birch wrote in a note.

329,2020/01/06,Services sector activity growth at 5-month high,"India’s services sector activity gained momentum and touched a five-month high in December, supported by an uptick in new business orders that boosted output as well as employment, a monthly survey showed on Monday.

The IHS Markit India Services Business Activity Index improved from 52.7 in November to 53.3 in December, highlighting the second-strongest rate of increase in output in over a year, after July.

“The news of sustained job creation, robust new order growth and a pick-up in business confidence suggest that expansion can be maintained in the early part of 2020,” said Pollyanna de Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit.

Survey members linked the increase in services sector activity growth to better market conditions and new business growth.

Moreover, total sales expanded for the third consecutive month at the end of the year, and at the quickest pace since October 2016.

On the prices front, input costs increased further in December, with monitored firms citing higher charges for food, fuel, medical products and transport.

“Worryingly, inflationary pressures intensified, with the fastest rise in input costs for almost seven years pushing output charge inflation to a 22-month high,” the survey said.

On the employment front, driven by rise in new business orders, service providers continued to hire extra staff in December and employment increased for the 28th month in succession.

The survey further noted that Indian services firms expect marketing efforts and favourable economic conditions to boost business activity during 2020. However, the overall level of positive sentiment remained below its long-run average.

Meanwhile, the Composite PMI Output Index that maps both the manufacturing and services sector, rose from 52.7 in November to 53.7, reflecting stronger rates of expansion in both the manufacturing and service sectors.

“With manufacturing sector weakness also fading in December, what was anticipated to be a disappointing private sector performance for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019/20 is now looking brighter,” Ms.Lima said.

Ms. Lima, however, noted that growth looks set to be sustained, but at an unspectacular rate, with the latest quarterly PMI Composite Output Index reading broadly in line with that recorded in the three months to September.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/services-sector-activity-growth-at-5-month-high/article30496452.ece
330,2020/01/06,Stressed urban cooperative banks to face PCA-like curbs,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to impose restrictions on urban cooperative banks (UCBs) for deterioration of financial position, in line with the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework that is imposed on commercial banks.

Under this revised Supervisory Action Framework (SAF), UCBs will face restrictions for worsening of three parameters: when net non-performing assets exceed 6% of net advances, when they incur losses for two consecutive financial years or have accumulated losses on their balance sheets, and if capital adequacy ratio falls below 9%.

Action can be also taken if there are serious governance issues, RBI said.

For breach of such risk thresholds, UCBs will be asked to submit a board-approved action plan to correct the situation like reducing net NPAs below 6%, for restoring the profitability and wiping out the accumulated losses, and increasing capital adequacy ratio to 9% or above within 12 months.

The board of the UCB will be asked to review the progress under the action plan on quarterly/monthly basis and submit the post-review progress report to the RBI.

The RBI may also seek a board-approved proposal for merging the UCB with another bank or converting itself into a credit society if CAR falls below 9%. It can impose restrictions on declaration or payment of dividend or donation without prior approval if any one of the risk thresholds is breached. Some of the other curbs include restricting fresh loans and advances carrying risk-weights more than 100% on incurring capital expenditure beyond a specified limit and on expansion of the balance sheet.

The RBI said actions such as imposition of all-inclusive directions under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, and issue of show-cause notice for cancellation of banking licence may be considered when continued normal functioning of the UCB is no longer considered to be in the interest of its depositors/public.

331,2020/01/06,"Tata-Mistry case: NCLAT dismisses RoC plea, refuses to modify its judgement","The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Monday dismissed the Registrar of Companies’ petition seeking modification of the judgement in the Tata-Mistry case and said its ruling had not cast any aspersions on the RoC.

“There is no ground to amend judgement dated December 18, 2019,” a two-member NCLAT bench said.

On December 18, the tribunal ruled reinstating Cyrus Mistry as the Executive Chairman of Tata Group and also termed conversion of Tata Sons from a public company to a private one by the RoC as “illegal”.

Tata Sons, Chairman Emeritus Ratan Tata and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have separately moved the Supreme Court against the NCLAT order.

In its plea, RoC -- under the corporate affairs ministry -- had sought to be impleaded as a party in the two petitions and deletion of words “illegal” and “with the help of the RoC” used by the NCLAT in its 172-page judgement.

In its plea, RoC, which functions under the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, had sought to be impleaded as a party in the two petitions and deletion of words “illegal” and “with the help of the RoC” used by the NCLAT in its 172-page-long judgement.

The tribunal had termed the appointment of N. Chandrasekaran, as ‘illegal’ following the October 2016 sacking of Mistry as Tata Sons’ executive chairman. It had also directed the RoC to reverse Tata Sons’ status from a ‘private company’ to a ‘public company’

In its urgent application, which was mentioned on December 23, just five days after the NCLAT’s December 18, judgement, RoC Mumbai had asked the appellate tribunal “to carry out requisite amendments” in Para 186 and 187 (iv) of its judgement “to correctly reflect the conduct of the RoC, Mumbai as not being illegal and being as per the provisions of the Companies Act“.

Besides, it had also urged “to delete the aspersions made regarding any hurried help accorded by the RoC Mumbai to Tata Sons, except what was statutorily required” in para 181 of the order.

In the order, the appellate tribunal had quashed the conversion of Tata Sons - the principal holding company and promoter of Tata firms - into a private company from a public firm and had termed it as “illegal“.

The tribunal had said that the action taken by the RoC to allow the firm to become a private company was against the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and ‘prejudicial’ and ‘oppressive’ to the minority member (Mistry Camp).

“The Company (Tata Sons) shall be recorded as ‘Public Company’ The RoC will make corrections in its record showing the Company as ‘Public Company’,” the NCLAT had said.

Contesting the observations, RoC Mumbai asked the NCLAT to “delete the aspersion made regarding any hurried help accorded by RoC Mumbai to Tata Sons except what was statutorily required by RoC Mumbai“.

The RoC also said it has acted in “bonafide manner” in converting the status of Tata Sons as “there was no stay granted by this appellate tribunal on the operation of the judgement dated July 9, 2018 of Mumbai, NCLT at the time when this intimation was filed by Tata Sons Ltd“.

In its petition, the RoC had asked “to carry out the requisite amendment in paragraphs ... of the judgement dated December 18, 2019 to correctly reflect the conduct of RoC Mumbai as not being illegal and being as per the provisions of the Companies Act along with the rules“.

Months after Mistry was sacked, Tata Sons had received its shareholders’ nod in September 2017, to convert itself into a private limited company from a public limited company, thereby absolving it of the need to take shareholder consent in taking crucial decisions, which could be passed with just the board’s approval.

Tata Sons Ltd was initially a ‘Private Company’ but after insertion of Section 43A (1A) in the Companies Act, 1956 on the basis of average annual turnover, it assumed the character of a deemed ‘Public Company’ with effect from February 1, 1975, the order said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/foo9in/article30468047.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THNCLAT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tata-mistry-case-nclat-dismisses-roc-plea-refuses-to-modify-its-judgement/article30491999.ece

The fall in the Indian equity markets was in line with most other markets, as Nikkei lost nearly 2%, while Hang Seng was down nearly 0.80%. Further, most of the European markets opened more than 1% lower on Monday.

‘Oil on peak’

“Global equity markets are under pressure as a flare-up of tensions in the Middle East sent gold to its highest in almost seven years and oil near its 4-month peak,” said Prasanna Pathak, fund manager, Taurus Mutual Fund.

“If brent crude sustains above $70 per barrel, fiscal deficit concern will again arise. Government could get restricted in its spending which could limit economic growth in medium term, while the Reserve Bankof India would be constrained in cutting interest rates,” Mr. Pathak added.

Brent crude prices touched nearly $71 per barrel during the day, while gold moved beyond $1,590 an ounce on Monday.

“Escalating tensions may dent market risk appetite and weigh down on risker assets like global equity markets and commodities like base metals,” said Ravindra Rao, head — Commodity Research, Kotak Securities.

“However, it may continue to lend support to safe havens like gold and silver and will also be supportive of crude oil prices amid worries over supply disruption from the region,” Mr. Rao added.

The retail pump prices of petrol in Delhi rose to ₹75.69 per litre — the highest since November 2018 — while those of diesel climbed to ₹68.68, according to a price notification of State-owned fuel retailers.

This is the fifth straight day of increase in retail pump prices.

Oil prices surged, gold hit a more than six-year high and equities tumbled Monday amid escalating U.S.-Iran tensions after the U.S. assassination of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani .

India is 84% dependant on imports to meet its oil needs and any spike in global prices has a direct bearing on its economy. Not just imports but even domestic crude oil — which forms the raw material for making petrol, diesel and other petroleum products — is priced according to international benchmarks.

The Middle East accounts for more than two-thirds of the country’s oil imports, with Iraq and Saudi Arabia being the top suppliers.

Even though the import basket has been sought to be diversified with oil being contracted from nations such as the U.S., pricing in all the regions is governed by international benchmarks and rates went up everywhere following Friday’s strikes.

Officials said there is no immediate threat of any supply disruption to India and the only impact would be felt in prices.

Goldman Sachs said an actual disruption to global supplies is needed to keep prices are current levels.

For an economy that is struggling to recover from a six-year low growth rate of 4.5%, a spike in oil prices poses a significant risk as it will not just stoke inflation but also lead to higher outgo on government subsidies on cooking fuel.

“Nowhere in the world has seen any supply being stopped because of U.S. strikes. Oil continues to flow as normal,” an official said.

Monday’s price increase is the fourth straight day of retail prices going up. Since January 2, petrol price has increased by 53 paise per litre while diesel rates have gone up 72 paise.

Prices were unchanged over the new year. Rates of petrol have been on the upswing since December 26 and that of diesel since November 29, 2019.

340,2020/01/06,Theatre of the absurd,"IIT-Kanpur’s decision to set up an investigation committee in response to complaints that the reading of Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s poem, “Hum dekhenge (We are sure to witness)”, at an anti-Citizenship Amedment Act rally on December 17 was an anti-national and anti-Hindu act is nothing short of a theatre of the absurd. The complaints registered by a temporary faculty member and 16 others demonstrate their ignorance of Urdu literary idiom, poetic metaphors, Faiz’s political views, and, above all, the context in which the poem was written.

Against injustice

Faiz Ahmed Faiz (1911-1984) was arguably the greatest Urdu poet of his generation. The fact that he was a Pakistani national was purely an accident of birth. He was a native of Lahore, which fell to Pakistan’s share. Additionally, Lahore had become a major centre of Urdu literature as well as progressive thought when he was growing up in pre-independence India and it was but natural that Faiz would find the literary and cultural atmosphere in that city conducive for the flowering of his poetic talent.

Faiz was a part of the All-India Progressive Writers’ Association established in 1936. The goal of the association was to promote equality and social justice, and many of its leading lights belonged to the Communist movement. The ideals of social equality and opposition to injustice and authoritarian rule inspired much of Faiz’s poetry.

His famous poem “Mujh se pehli si mohabbat mere mehboob na maang” (My beloved do not demand from me the earlier intensity of love)” is a classic embodying his quest for social justice. In it, Faiz tells his imaginary beloved not to expect the same intensity of love from him that existed earlier, now that he has become aware of the oppression inflicted on his people by an age-old system based on inequality and injustice. Consequently, he implies, his passion for his beloved is bound to be diluted because a major part of his energies has to be diverted to fighting oppression and injustice.

Faiz’s anguish when Partition accompanied independence was embodied in his poem “Subh-e Azadi (The dawn of independence)”. It begins with the couplet, “Yeh daagh daagh ujaalaa, yeh shab gazidaa seher; Woh intezaar tha jiska, yeh woh seher to nahin (This blemished light infused with the darkness of night; Surely, this isn’t the dawn we waited for so eagerly)”. This political statement cannot be surpassed in its intensity of feeling by political speeches denouncing Partition.

A clarion call

Faiz spent a few years in Pakistani jails in the 1950s for his revolutionary views and produced an anthology of poems titled Zindan Nama (Prison Musings) while incarcerated. He had to go into self-imposed exile from 1979 to 1982 because of persecution under the Zia-ul-Haq regime. His poem, “Hum dekhenge”, written in 1979 was a clarion call for resistance against Zia’s authoritarian and fundamentalist rule. Written for a predominantly Muslim audience it effectively used Islamic imagery to denounce the fundamentalism and authoritarianism that had become the hallmark of the regime. It uses the allegory of judgment day when all false gods (authoritarian rulers) will be overthrown and all thrones and crowns will be destroyed (“sab taaj uchhale jayenge; sab takht giraye jayenge”) in order to project a democratic and egalitarian future for the world.

It is ironical that a poem condemning authoritarianism and Islamic fundamentalism should be denounced as being anti-Hindu and anti-Indian. It demonstrates the cultural philistinism of those making the charge and their total lack of understanding of the poem’s context. “Hum dekhenge” was written to inspire the masses not only in Pakistan but everywhere to take their destiny in their own hands and overthrow authoritarian and bigoted rulers. For, as Faiz posits, the day is bound to come when dictators who behave like gods will be toppled and the will of the people will prevail.

341,2020/01/06,Safeguarding the idea of India,"Ominous clouds have gathered over India, casting shadows of divisiveness and hate, threatening to undermine civil society and halt or even reverse economic progress. There is today a risk of going over a precipice beyond which there may not be a turning point.

As the new decade dawned, the two of us decided to get together to write not on problems of economic theory or some immediate policy challenge, as we did in the past, but on the nation’s social and political predicament, which poses an existential challenge. We have known each other for decades, and grown up in an India that was imperfect but seemed to possess an ideal of togetherness that created hope. We come from different backgrounds. One of us (as the reader may have guessed) is Bengali, one Punjabi; one of us is Hindu, one Sikh. What is common between us is a concern for human well-being and a belief in the fundamental importance of empathy, tolerance and compassion; the need to treat all human beings as equal; and to reach out to anybody in need — irrespective of religion, gender, and caste. We believe that judgments concerning what is morally good or fair must not depend on who is making the judgment or his or her religion or race. These are principles emphasised in the writings of John Rawls and go back to the Enlightenment philosophers. These are also principles that can be found in the writings of philosophers and religious thinkers on the Indian subcontinent. These are the moorings of the very idea of India.

India’s composite culture

This is the time to remember the spirit of Guru Nanak, which led Guru Arjan to write, “No one is my enemy, no one is a stranger, I am connected with all,” and Guru Gobind Singh to insist, “Recognise all of humanity as one.” This is the time to remember Rabindranath Tagore’s resonant verse: “Come Aryans, come non-Aryans, Hindus and Mussalmans/ Come today, Englishmen, come Christians/ Come Brahmin, cleansing your mind/ Join hands with all.”

It is the sharp erosion in these basic moral tenets in India that concerns us. India has had a turbulent history since its independence on that momentous midnight of August 1947. There have been dark times and events that we should all be ashamed of. Following the end of the Second World War, many new nations were born as peoples and lands shook off their colonial shackles and declared independence. These nations began with idealism, embracing democracy and equality, but military coups and religious captures felled the ideals of one nation after another. But India stood out as a beacon of hope, committed to democracy, freedom of speech and secularism. From the mid-1990s, it also began to see rapid economic growth.

There are still many challenges to contend with. There is poverty and discrimination, there is corruption and a growing environmental challenge, and there is pollution that, if left unchecked, will damage the cognitive powers of future generations. We have to attend to these urgently. The steady progress of the economy since the mid-1990s was raising hope that we would take on these challenges head on. The divisiveness being advocated has, however, caused a setback. This is affecting trust and cooperation in the nation. For example, the use of the state machinery in Uttar Pradesh to seek “revenge,” and to promote the ring-fencing of people and silencing of voices is ethically unacceptable and doing great damage to India’s standing globally.

Trust improves economy

What is not always appreciated, but for which there is a lot of evidence, is that societal trust and a sense of belonging improves economic outcomes, including growth. Economists Yann Algan and Pierre Cahuc have used rigorous statistical analysis to show that higher levels of trust can cause national income to increase dramatically: Africa, with Sweden’s trust levels, would achieve six times its present per capita income. A recent study, published in Harvard Business Review, shows that if workers feel appreciated and have a sense of belonging to their company, they have a 56% higher job performance, there is a 50% drop in turnover risk, and a 75% reduction in sick days. “For a 10,000-person company, this would result in annual savings of more than $52M”. One has to extrapolate this to a nation to get a sense of how economically important this sense of belonging is.

Even before the turmoil of 2019, India’s economy was already reeling, with industry, agriculture and exports all growing much slower than a decade earlier. But now, beyond the basic moral principles at stake, we argue that the promotion of hate and divisiveness is also hurting India’s economy. We are at risk of a major downward spiral.

A call to reject partisanship

We must make this a moment to pause and ask ourselves what we as individuals must do. We write this to appeal not just to the young students, scientists and Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Muslims who are already out there protesting against the doctrine of exclusion, but also to those who are preaching violence. We urge them to look into their own hearts, and drop their cudgels. We suggest to the police and functionaries of the state that to make people listen to and respect them, they must not just wield the baton, but also be bearers of ethical standards.

We take hope from the fact that so many students on our campuses understand this. We take hope from the fact that so many leading thinkers and scientists, unaffiliated to any political party, have begun to speak up. We take hope from the Sikhs who have refused to discriminate against other religious groups, from the Hindus who have stood with the Muslims and Christians to defend all minorities, to uphold India’s commitment to democracy and secularism.

We are not suggesting that if we stand together and pull back from the brink of the precipice, all our challenges will disappear. India is a lower-middle income economy, with a great deal of injustice, unfairness and suffering that will not vanish in haste. Yet, if we resolve to reject the partisanship that is being preached and then strive to take on the many challenges, there can be hope, the hope of pulling back from the brink and building a society and an economy that will be exemplary for not just its own people but for the world.

342,2020/01/06,Spotting an opportunity in changing fundamentals,"The “Phase One” trade deal between the United States and China gives both sides a reprieve, especially since the U.S. stayed its hand in not imposing additional tariffs worth $160-billion in mid-December. But the rift runs deep. Beyond trade, the chasm is growing. A technology war has erupted in the areas of artificial intelligence, digital space and 5G. Tensions have risen following the U.S.’s passing of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 and the proposed Uighur Act.

The slowdown in the global economy is compounded by the U.S.-China trade war. As more sectors get drawn in, costs are rising and disrupting global supply chains.

Energy concerns

Slack demand for energy and surplus production mainly by the U.S. had lowered oil prices, which was good news for India, given its huge imports. Lower energy prices may help India address its current account deficit. It can also make India’s export sector more competitive. But oil prices have surged more than 4% following the U.S. air strike killing Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, Commander of the Qods Force. An outbreak of hostilities would send oil prices soaring. Unlike India, China continues to buy Iranian crude oil and is its largest buyer. Reports suggest that China will invest $280-billion in developing Iran’s oil, gas and petrochemicals sectors and even station Chinese security personnel to guard Chinese projects. Dependence on China prevents Iran from criticising China on its policies in Xinjiang. In tensions with the U.S., Iran sees in China a sympathiser.

India’s ramped up energy imports from the U.S. are likely to touch $10-billion in 2019-2020. Meanwhile, China’s interest in Saudi Aramco’s initial public offering and interest in weakening the dollar in the global energy market has grown. It is forging closer ties with oil producers that are in the U.S.’s cross hairs on human rights and governance issues. This facilitates its naval presence in the western Indian Ocean, including the Strait of Hormuz.

On trade

According to a State Bank of India “Ecowrap” report of July 2019, India has scarcely benefited from U.S.-China trade. Of the $35-billion dip in China’s exports to the U.S. market in the first half of 2019, about $21-billion (or 62%) was diverted to other countries. The rest, $14-billion, was made good largely by the U.S. producers. Going by a UN Conference on Trade and Development report of November 2019, additional exports from India to the U.S. market in the first half of the year due to trade diversion amounted to only $755-million. U.S. tariffs on China seem to have made some other players such as Taiwan, Mexico, Vietnam and the European Union even more competitive.

China is facing a great shortage of pork due to an outbreak of swine flu but India’s meat exports, primarily buffalo meat, reach China indirectly through Vietnam and the Philippines, adding to costs and reducing market share. Besides, India’s pork exports are meagre. China’s ambitious thrust on artificial intelligence, robotics, autonomous vehicles and space technologies has goaded the Donald Trump administration into action. With tensions rising after the blacklisting of Huawei Technologies by the U.S., the spectre of a high-tech war looms large.

The big three Chinese high-tech companies, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, together poured in $5-billion in Indian startups in 2018. India could use this opportunity to try and force China to pry open its market to India’s IT and other tech exports. The U.S.-China high-tech war threatens India’s strategic autonomy. Yet India has decided to allow all network equipment makers, including Huawei, to participate in 5G spectrum trials. The outcome is far from clear.

As U.S.-China tensions drive supply chains out of China, India could emerge as an alternative destination with the right policies, as Vietnam has done.

Any impact on clean energy targets in China due to U.S. technology restrictions in the nuclear field could be a setback to efforts to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change in the entire region.

Denial regimes often spur domestic research and development and if the development of India’s own missile programme during years of U.S. sanctions is anything to go by, China may yet succeed in riding out the storm on the technology front.

China claims that the U.S. is behind the disturbances in Hong Kong. There is no sign of the protests abating. If things turn uglier, India may have to cater to refugees of Indian origin.

Key regional issues

The situation in the South China Sea is weighted in favour of China given its fait accompli in occupying several man-made islands. India has no role in negotiating the “Code of Conduct” with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, though it is a participant in the “Quad” dialogue on broader issues in the Indo-Pacific. India reserves the right to sail and fly unhindered through the South China Sea in accordance with the principles of freedom of navigation and overflight.

On connectivity, the U.S.’s position is helpful to India. Recently, the U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary, Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs Alice G. Wells criticised the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which traverses Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, as eventually worsening Islamabad’s economic troubles. India is neither part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) nor the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. It is absent from the Indo-Pacific Business Forum created by the U.S., Japan and Australia as also from the Blue Dot network. A future challenge lies in India having to reconcile its own regional connectivity initiatives with the BRI projects that have mushroomed in the neighbourhood.

In the ideological battlefield, China’s economic success has emboldened it such that it challenges the liberal democracy model and offers an alternative developmental model based on its own system.

Overall, the military advances by China notwithstanding, U.S. defence spending far outstrips China’s budget. Its nuclear arsenal dwarfs that of China. With the creation of a U.S. Space Force as a separate arm under the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. will seek to increase its superiority in network-centric warfare. As China’s anxieties in the Asia-Pacific theatre grow, India may yet have to contend with a greater Chinese military presence on its periphery. The Western Theater Command created in 2016 is responsible for the border with India. It is the largest of China’s military regions, and the Tibet Military Command under it has been accorded a higher status than other provincial commands to widen its scope for combat preparedness.

U.S.-China rivalry coincides with an upward trajectory in India-U.S. relations. This is important for equilibrium and multi-polarity in Asia, even as India and China try and build much-needed trust and cooperation.

343,2020/01/06,Least surprise: On Tamil Nadu local body poll results,"The only surprise in the December 2019 elections to rural local bodies in Tamil Nadu was that there was no surprise. Held after eight years, the polls, which were due in October 2016, were relatively peaceful, with around 77% of voters — nearly two crore people — exercising their franchise in 27 of 36 districts to elect their representatives for village panchayats, panchayat unions and district panchayats. The results reaffirmed that much of the State’s political space continues to remain with the DMK and the ruling AIADMK. Some churn was thought possible in the light of the debate on the perceived vacuum in political leadership in the State. The DMK-led front — it won 38 of the 39 Lok Sabha seats last year — has retained its lead over its arch rival with a higher tally of wards in panchayat unions and district panchayats, the elections to which are on political lines. However, the fact that the AIADMK, an important ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party, has been able to bridge some of the gap with the DMK was also in keeping with the results in the Assembly by-elections in October last. Clearly, both parties have reasons to believe that their prospects in the 2021 Assembly polls are good. Though the ruling party appears to have regained much of its support base lost during the parliamentary polls — this being the first State-wide electoral contest in the last seven months — the reality that it finished behind its key adversary in the overall tally of the local bodies’ wards is a situation that will not be to the liking of its leadership; the perception is that the AIADMK is traditionally stronger in the rural areas. Finally, political mobilisation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, is believed to be a factor that influenced voters against the ruling party.

The State Election Commission (SEC), which conducted itself reasonably well with new measures such as the use of flying squads and closed circuit television sets, should stick to its plan of holding the polls to urban local bodies including the Greater Chennai Corporation and abide by the Supreme Court’s direction of completing the poll process for rural local bodies in the remaining nine districts within three months. It should note that the reason behind the Court granting more time is for carrying out fresh delimitation of wards in five new districts. The panel should also ensure that the poll process is always fair and credible. It would be in the fitness of things for the State government to assist the SEC in ensuring the early completion of the next round of polls. Any delay will not reflect well on the SEC and the ruling party. For the AIADMK, it will be an occasion for course correction. For the DMK, the message is that it cannot be complacent. It is the front runner, but the AIADMK is regaining momentum.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/least-surprise/article30487609.ece
344,2020/01/06,Life of science: On Indian Science Congress,"The Indian Science Congress (ISC) — its 107th edition is under way in Bengaluru — has served as a reminder of the status accorded to science and technology in the early years of the Indian republic. Though the formation of the congress pre-dates the Indian republic, it was the intellectual nursery of modern science in the country. Early ideas of how science and technology could aid the development of the new nation were incubated at this coming together of scientists. It is for this reason that the congress, normally held in the first week of January, is inaugurated by the Prime Minister. The years since have seen the nature of the congress change: from one where scientists, in the era of postal communication, congregated to exchange scientific ideas to one today where it has become a ‘science mela’. The prime purpose of the ISC now is to draw school and science college students to hear Nobel Laureates and Indian-origin scientists from abroad to lecture about their work and the future prospects of science. The other draws are science projects and innovations by schoolchildren and stalls showcasing scientific work being done in key national laboratories and institutions.

But there is an unmistakable decay, a choreographed ennui, that has set in. In recent years, the congress often makes news for becoming a forum for pseudoscience and less for interesting scientific ideas or demonstrations. Speakers — some holding distinguished positions in leading universities — have tended to mix mythology and science and publicise far-fetched assertions: that the Kauravas were born from stem-cell technology and the Vedas discussed avionics. While this has eroded the congress’s public image, the government itself does not seem too keen to vitalise it. The exhibits at several scientific laboratories are re-runs from old congresses, or from similar and past science fairs. Many laboratories showcase their work as ‘posters’ rather than actually showing demonstrations or working inventions. Several luminaries of India’s science establishments — the Principal Scientific Adviser, secretaries from several ministries, the chiefs of major organisations such as ISRO or the Department of Atomic Energy, who have been fixtures, or have at least had their organisation present a dedicated talk or session, were absent this year. It is inevitable that traditions change over time and the relative importance accorded to institutions wax and wane. However this must make way for inspiring new ideas, or new models of taking science to the public. A rising trend in science displays, at museums or exhibitions in many places, is to mix science and art as well as make interactive displays that encourage audience engagement. A rebirth, and not a creeping requiem, is what the congress needs.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/life-of-science/article30487606.ece
345,2020/01/06,10 years of Slum Janandolana Karnataka,"Slum Janandolana Karnataka, an organisation that has been working for the rights and empowerment of slum dwellers in the State, celebrated its 10th anniversary here on Monday.

Inaugurating the event by playing the Djembe and offering floral tribute to Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and Savitribai Phule, former IAS officer S. Sasikanth Senthil called upon citizens belonging to the Dalit communities and economically weaker sections to stand in solidarity with the minority communities. “We must stand against Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register. It is not the question of religion; it is an issue of Constitutional rights,” he said.

Earlier, a report on Slum Janandolana Karnataka’s 10-year journey was released by Y.J. Rajendra, president, People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Karnataka. He remarked that after a struggle of 10 years, it was heartening that the government was now taking into consideration slum dwellers.

Narasimha Murthy, State convener of Slum Janadolana Karnataka, said that making cities slum-free was not a development parameter. “Real development is when the government provides rights to all citizens, without any discrimination or injustice,” he said.

The anniversary celebrations saw attendance from nearly 200 people from 18 different districts. According to Kaveri from Slum Janandolana Karnataka, the organisation works not just on issues of slum dwellers, but also different communities that live in slums, such as sex workers, sexual minorities and contract labourers.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/10-years-of-slum-janandolana-karnataka/article30497312.ece
346,2020/01/06,Renewed interest in pedestrianisation of Gandhi Bazaar,"The move to pedestrianise Gandhi Bazaar seems to be back on the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike’s (BBMP) agenda.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar, accompanied by MLA Uday Garudachar and senior civic officials, inspected Gandhi Bazaar on Monday and discussed ways to make the area a pedestrian-only thoroughfare.

Mr. Anil Kumar told The Hindu that a few years ago, the Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) had submitted a proposal on pedestrianisation of the thoroughfare between Tagore Circle and Ramakrishna Ashram Junction. “We are re-examining the proposal,” he said.

Three options

He added that there were three possible options: complete pedestrianisation of the stretch, partial pedestrianisation and another which is a mix of both with adequate parking facilities being created. “The DULT consultants have been asked to discuss with the traffic police and come out with a comprehensive traffic plan. Following this, we will hold consultations with stakeholders,” he said.

Vijay Narnapatti, Director, mayaPRAXIS, the architectural design consultant for the street market redesign, and Brinda Sastry, urban design consultant, were also present during the inspection. Mr. Narnapatti said after walking through the street, the designers sat down with the BBMP Commissioner to discuss the different design aspects.

Leo Saldanha from Environment Support Group, which is one of the consultants, said: “There was some resistance from the residents. We even took a few traders to Ima Keithel, the women’s market in Manipur. The pedestrianisation project is progressive and futuristic.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/renewed-interest-in-pedestrianisation-of-gandhi-bazaar/article30497285.ece
347,2020/01/06,KPL betting scam: One more bookie nabbed,"The Central Crime Branch (CCB) sleuths probing the alleged international betting and spot-fixing scams in the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) nabbed a bookie from Kempegowda International Airport on Monday.

“The bookie Jatin Sait, 32, who is one of the main accused in the scam, had fled to the Middle East after his name cropped up during the course of investigations,” said a senior police officer.

The CCB officials had got a Lookout Circular issued for him. “He was caught by the airport police soon after he landed from the Netherlands. We are still questioning him. He had obtained anticipatory bail while on the run,” the police said.

Jatin, who hails from Sonipet in Haryana, allegedly has close ties with Sayyam, another bookie who has already been arrested by the CCB. “The duo was involved in match fixing and running an inter-State racket. Like Sayyam, Jatin was also in touch with many players and cricket team members to run the scam,” said the officer.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kpl-betting-scam-one-more-bookie-nabbed/article30497258.ece
348,2020/01/06,"Two killed as bus runs amok, hits 8 vehicles","Two people were killed and at least six others injured when a crowded Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) bus ploughed into several vehicles after its brakes allegedly failed on the busy Kottigepalya Junction ramp around 9 a.m. on Monday.

When the bus driver, Venkatesh, realised that the brakes were not responding, he veered to the right, away from pedestrians and crowds of people who were visiting a nearby temple for Vaikuntha Ekadashi, and rammed into at least eight vehicles — six two-wheelers, a car and an autorickshaw.

The two-wheelers took the brunt of the impact, and two men riding them succumbed to injuries. According to the police, the deceased, Byalappa, 43, and Vishwaradhya, 48, were on their two-wheelers when the bus hit them.

“On impact, Byalappa’s scooter got jammed between the bus and a passing car. He and Vishwaradhya on his motorcycle were dragged by the bus for a few yards, as it continued to mow down more vehicles in its path,” said a senior police officer.

As motorists swerved to avoid the bus, passers-by alerted the Kamakshipalya traffic police. Byalappa was killed on the spot, while Vishwaradhya was taken to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. Three of the injured motorists — Harshith, 23, Nagaraj, 34, and Arunakshi, 23 — are in the intensive care unit. The others suffered minor injuries. “Fortunately, there were no pedestrians on the road when the accident happened,” the officer said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nmahxj/article30497247.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGBUSACCIDENT1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/two-killed-as-bus-runs-amok-hits-8-vehicles/article30497248.ece
349,2020/01/06,Lucky escape for those waiting at the bus stop,"On Monday morning, BMTC bus driver Venkatesh pulled out of Seegehalli depot to take route number 245/3 from Madanayakanahalli to Majestic. He later told the police that he had raised a complaint with the depot manager for many days about the bus having some technical problems.

Around 9 a.m., as he approached Kottigepalya Junction ramp, he told the police that he realised that the brakes were not working. There was heavy traffic on the road and Venkatesh tried to manoeuvre the bus for around 200 yards.

Just ahead of the ramp, he saw a crowd of people. Some were commuters waiting at the bus stand, others had come to a nearby temple for Vaikunta Ekadashi. On realising that he had lost control of the vehicle, he veered to the right towards oncoming traffic.

“There were over a hundred people standing by the roadside. If Venkatesh had veered to the left, the number of casualties would have been more,” said B.R. Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic).

RTO officials summoned

Pedestrians watched in horror as the bus careened into vehicles. “I was working close by and heard a thud and shrieks. I ran along with the others towards the main road and saw motorcycles being dragged under the bus,” said Ravi Kumar, a private firm employee.

The police are still to determine whether brake failure was the reason for the accident. “Venkatesh, in his statement, said the brakes were not working. We have summoned RTO officials for a detailed inspection to verify his claims,” Mr. Gowda added.

Based on his allegations that despite his complaints the bus had not been serviced, the Kamakshipalya police are questioning the depot manager Shivalingaiah.

Soumyalatha S.K., DCP, said the police along with the BBMP and PWD officials will conduct a joint inspection to study the scene of the accident where road-widening work is under way. “A committee will analyse and study the site and submit ways to improve traffic and road engineering to prevent accidents,” she said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/rf8wlv/article30497206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BGACCIDENTPEOPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/lucky-escape-for-those-waiting-at-the-bus-stop/article30497213.ece
350,2020/01/06,Hundreds rally in protest against attack on JNU students and staff,"The attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University students and staff in New Delhi by an armed mob on Sunday evening triggered a wave of protests in Bengaluru. Hundreds of people gathered at Town Hall on Monday in solidarity with the JNU students, voicing their anger against the violence and the alleged inaction of the Delhi police.

While the call for the protest was given by five Left-leaning students’ organisations, it evolved into a spontaneous reaction with students from several colleges joining in. People started arriving at Town Hall in the morning, and by evening the crowd had swelled to more than 800.

A majority of the protesters were students, and they were joined by faculty members, activists, as well farmers leaders. Several students, who had stayed away from the previous rallies against the Citizenship Amendment Act and NRC, said they decided to come out on Monday as they were pained by the attack in an educational institution.

Protesters demanded the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor of JNU and the immediate arrest of those who attacked the students and faculty.

Students sang songs to keep the morale high. Veilou Paotei, a Masters student from United Theological College said. “If JNU students who are in such a prestigious university are not secure, then nobody is safe. We cannot afford to be in the classroom and talk about theories and be armchair scholars. It is time to take the protest to the streets.”

Kumar S., an engineering professor said, “Now children cannot express themselves, and there are assaults on the campuses. It is worrisome because if you do not go with the thinking of the government, then you are being hounded. The kind of attack on JNU proves that this is a sheer diversionary tactic when the country is facing pressing issues such as unemployment and economic slowdown.”

Several prominent activists stated that there was a need to look at all the instances cumulatively — the police brutality at Jamia Millia Islamia University and Aligarh Muslim University last year, and the Central government’s move to implement CAA, NRC and NRP.

Rajashekhar V.N., All Indian president, All India Democratic Students Organisation, who has taken part in thousands of protests, described the gathering as a spontaneous outburst of people against the ABVP who allegedly attacked students and faculty. “People don’t want to tolerate injustice and this is the tipping point. It will be the last nail on the coffin of ABVP and BJP.”

Kodihalli Chandrashekar, farmers’ leader who was present at the protest said, “Whether it is injustice against farmers or students, we need to fight it. Nobody should attack anyone and we extend our support to student organisations,” he said.

Meanwhile, students and research scholars of Indian Institute of Science staged a protest on their campus late on Monday evening against the attack. Research scholars from National Institute of Advanced Studies and National Center For Biological Sciences also took part in the nearly two-hour protest.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/7okjkd/article30497124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BGPROTEST1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hundreds-rally-in-protest-against-attack-on-jnu-students-and-staff/article30497126.ece

Members expressed concern over the shortage of radiologists in the State and urged the government to take steps to address this issue.

They requested the State government to amend the existing law and allow MBBS doctors and other specialists to get a one-year course in radiology.

352,2020/01/06,BMTC forms team to ascertain cause of accident,"The BMTC officials suspect that while the cause of accident could be brake failure as alleged by the driver, it could also be owing to the fact that Venkatesh may have lost control of the vehicle while on the slope.

An official of the BMTC said: “The driver has informed the police that brake failure is the reason, but it is hard to believe. Usually, at the depot level itself, technical issues get rectified whenever drivers raise the issue. The accident occurred on a slope, and it is possible that he lost control of the vehicle. We will know for sure once we get results of the probe.” The corporation has suspended the depot manager and assistant work superintendent.

According to the BMTC officials, Venkatesh has been with the corporation for 10 to 12 years and has not been involved in an accident until Monday morning. BMTC Managing Director C. Shikha told The Hindu that a team of mechanical staff will inspect the bus to ascertain the reason for the accident. “We will know the reason only after the team submits a report.”

The bus bearing registration number KA 57 F 696 was inducted into the fleet six years ago. Officials said an ex gratia of ₹25,000 will be given to the families of the deceased.

353,2020/01/06,"Decide swiftly on granting sanction to CBI to prosecute 3 police officers, HC tells State","The High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the State government to take immediate decision on requests submitted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) seeking sanction for prosecution of three police officers in criminal cases registered against the I Monetary Advisory (IMA) Group of companies.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction as the CBI, in its status report on the probe, informed the court that it had sent letters seeking sanction from the State government on December 18, 2019 while pointing out that the agency is probing the role played by some police officers in the scam.

The Bench directed the State government to treat the CBI’s request on priority and out-of-turn and take immediate decision on grant of prior sanction for prosecution of identified officers under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act. Also, the State government has been directed to take immediate decision on prior sanction sought by the CBI under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The CBI, in its confidential status report, had also informed the court that the probe is under progress with regard to the role played by some of the officers of the State’s Criminal Investigation Department as well as a few officials of the Income Tax Department and some politicians.

Head of investigation

Meanwhile, in response to apprehensions raised by a few petitioners that some officers in the CBI’s Multi-Disciplinary Investigation Team (MDIT) probing the IMA cases are likely to be changed, the CBI’s Special Public Prosecutor told the Bench that the tenure of deputation of Joint Director A.Y.V. Krishna, who is on deputation to CBI and heading the MDIT in IMA cases, is coming to an end on January 17.

Following this, the Bench directed the CBI to submit a proposal to the Union government for extension of his tenure with the CBI, while directing the Union government to consider grant of extension of his tenure considering the magnitude of offence in IMA cases. It also observed that prima facie the court is satisfied with the investigation done by the CBI.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dkhws/article30497081.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/decide-swiftly-on-granting-sanction-to-cbi-to-prosecute-3-police-officers-hc-tells-state/article30497083.ece
354,2020/01/06,Court is more concerned about environment; its protection is not a monopoly of activists: HC,"Observing orally that the “court is more concerned about environment” and “protection of environment is not a monopoly of activists”, the High Court of Karnataka on Monday declined to entertain a PIL petition, which had questioned the State government’s proposal to construct a seven-storied building for the High Court by demolishing an old building, which is surrounded by the Cubbon Park and earlier housed the office of the Election Commission.

Terming as “premature” the petition filed by the Cubbon Park Walkers’ Association, the court pointed out that the government had only granted in-principle approval to a proposal to demolish the old building and construct a new one. Neither has the government taken a final decision on construction of a seven-storied building nor have the High Court’s administrative wing or building committee approved any building plan or submitted plan for sanction from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, if such a permission is necessary, the court noted.

A Division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar, in its order also referred to a resolution passed on November 6, 2019 by the Full Court of the High Court, in which it was pointed out that discussions were going on with the State government and the Chief Secretary since June 2019 for providing additional space for shifting certain wings functioning from the basement of the existing court building as over 400 staffs have been working there in temporary offices.

A suggestion of demolishing the old building and constructing a new building on the same plinth area, with seven upper floors and two basements, came up in such meetings, the Bench said while pointing out that the Full Court had unanimously resolved that the State government must examine the legality and propriety of constructing a new building in place of the old one, including whether new construction will offend environmental laws and rights of citizens.

The Full Court had also resolved that the High Court’s administration must proceed further only if the government is of the view that the construction of the proposed building is legal.

“If the government is of the view that a new building cannot be constructed by demolishing the old one, the Full Court was of the view that the government may be requested to immediately allot a premises or a site for construction of a building in the area of minimum 1,20,000 sq ft in the vicinity of the High Court.

Earlier, the Bench orally observed that “courts love criticism but such criticism should be fair,” and described the allegations by the petitioner about violation of law as a mere “figment of imagination.”

Two other petitions

While observing that it has not decided the legality of the proposal to construct a new building by demolishing old one or whether proposed area falls within a park, the Bench decided to hear two other PIL petitions, which have sought directions for providing better working space for staff members working in the basement.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/court-is-more-concerned-about-environment-its-protection-is-not-a-monopoly-of-activists-hc/article30497066.ece
355,2020/01/06,JCTU to take out rally on Jan. 8 as part of strike call,"As part of the nationwide general strike call on January 8, the Joint Committee of Trade Unions (JCTU) will take out a rally from Town Hall via Mysore Bank to Freedom Park, where the protest will be held against the Central government labour laws.

In a press conference on Monday, the members of JCTU expressed their disappointment with the Central government and its “anti-worker” policies.

The JCTU has drafted a 12-point charter consisting of their demands from the Centre. They include a fixed minimum wage of ₹21,000, pension facility for all workers, immediate measures to control price hike, equal pay for equal work, strengthening the unorganised welfare board, and increasing wages of those working under Udyog Khatri Yojana and other daily wage labourers.

The office-bearers have alleged that the government continued to bring up trivial issues to divert people’s attentions from important issues that concern the country and workers in particular. “The Central government has failed to come to the aid of farmers who are in distress. Farmer suicide rates have increased tremendously under the BJP-led government,” said K.V. Bhat, V-P of AIUTUC.

The members also condemned the attack on Jawaharlal Nehru University students by goons. “We must act against the Delhi police who are in support of goons and perpetrating violence on students,” said Kalappa Lakshmaiah, general secretary, HMKP. “People are speaking against NRC and CAA and through this strike, we will speak against the government’s trade policies,” he added.

Meanwhile, several organisations have maintained that they will not support the bandh call. Bruhat Bangalore Hotels Association in a release said that hotels in the city will be functional as usual in the city on January 8. Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation management has cautioned its employees of taking action if they participate in the strike.

358,2020/01/06,Fire Department seeks permission to grant fire compliance certificate,"As the city grows vertically, the Karnataka State Fire and Emergency Services Department wants all high-rises developed before the National Building Code of 2016 came into effect to upgrade their fire safety mechanisms. Over 10,000 high-rises in Bengaluru, which fall in this category, are susceptible to fire, as they have not followed the updated National Building Code of either 2016 or the earlier ones, said officials.

The department has written to the State government seeking permission to order these buildings to institute safety measures within their premises. Once they comply, the department wants to issue a ‘Fire Compliance Certificate’.

“The proposed Fire Safety Certificate is not a No Objection Certificate (NOC) or a Compliance Certificate (CC). It is an initiative to make sure that the buildings that have not followed external fire safety guidelines to have a more robust internal fire safety mechanism,” said Sunil Agarwal, Additional Director General of Police, Fire and Emergency Services Department. Only the buildings built before 2016 will be covered under this 'compensatory fire safety system'. ""Many high-rises, due to various reasons, do not have a proper NOC or CC. Hence, Fire Compliance Certificates will be issued until further action is taken against the owners,” Mr. Agarwal said.

The National Building Code includes a separate and comprehensive chapter on fire safety, where it specifies, for instance, how many exits should be provided in a specific kind of building and where they must be placed.

Officials admit that while it is not feasible for buildings to make major alterations to the external structure, residents will be able to install internal safety features. ""For example, in place of two fire extinguishers, we will direct them to have four. It will be like an internal retrofit, which is possible and practical,"" Mr. Agarwal added. Other proposed measures include installing more smokescreens in staircase areas and water curtains in basements.

Many apartments have deliberately violated norms. “The minimum setback size prescribed is six metres. However, many establishments which have used that space for other purposes, and some have even been encroached upon,” said a senior official.

Muralidhar Rao of the Bangalore Apartments' Federation (BAF) said there was an immediate need for agencies to take responsibility for their actions and awarding NOCs to builders even if they had not adhered to all the norms. “There are blatant violations taking place even now. All those have to be immediately stopped,"" he said.

The initiative was part of ‘Chennai Reads’ organised by Booksellers and Publishers Association of South India (BAPASI) to encourage reading habit among youngsters.

The event was organised as a precursor to the 43rd Chennai Book Fair to be inaugurated on January 9 in the city. Besides students from various government and private schools, several parents, teachers and city residents took part in the initiative that attempted to create a record.

Students were engrossed in reading Tamil books given to them for nearly half an hour. They were given a participation certificate after the event. Chennai District Collector R.

363,2020/01/06,Governor urges Centre to approve project to develop Mamallapuram,"Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit on Monday urged the Centre to accord speedy approval for a proposal to the tune of ₹563 crore sent by the State government to develop Mamallapuram. The historic coastal town had hosted the second India-China Informal Summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping in October last year.

“The Prime Minister promised a tourism development package for Mamallapuram and a proposal for ₹563.50 crore has been prepared and sent to the Centre for approval. I urge the Centre to accord speedy approval,” he said in his customary address to the Legislative Assembly.

During the summit, it was also decided that Fujian province and Quanzhou city in China would establish sister state/province and city relations with Tamil Nadu and Chennai. As a follow-up, a high-level Chinese delegation also visited Chennai recently.

Referring to the recent Good Governance Index which ranked Tamil Nadu first among 18 big States, the Governor lauded the leadership of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. The Governor also said that the rural local body polls in the remaining nine districts and for the urban local bodies would be held shortly.

Since Tamil Nadu was a water deficit State, inter-basin transfer of river water was essential to meet its water needs, he said. “To fulfil this need, this Government urges the Government of India to divert at least 200 TMC of water from the Godavari to the Cauvery basin, as the initial stage of the inter-State river water linkage.”

The State government was taking steps to secure the release of 17 fishermen from Tamil Nadu, who are presently in Sri Lankan prisons. “The State Government reiterates its demand that the Government of India should intervene and have this issue amicably resolved at the earliest,” the Governor said.

Contending that the sugar industry was facing a crisis, which was adversely affecting the livelihood of sugarcane farmers, the Governor said: “As part of the way forward, financial restructuring of the sugar mills is required and I request the Union Government to announce a special financial package to assist the revival of the sugar sector in Tamil Nadu.”

The Governor said that the State government also has proposed several projects to the Centre for consideration under the Green Climate Fund and National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change at a cost of ₹4,682 crore. “I request the Government of India to speedily approve these proposals,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jabvfe/article30493805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06JANTH-SHORETEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/governor-urges-centre-to-approve-project-to-develop-mamallapuram/article30493806.ece
364,2020/01/06,Rail-based transit system to be built between Tambaram and Velachery to ease congestion,"To address increasing traffic congestion on the Tambaram-Velachery corridor, the Tamil Nadu government will establish a rail-based transit system for a total of 15.5 km and Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) will prepare the Detailed Feasibility and Project Report, Governor Banwarilal Purohit said on Monday.

In his address in the Legislative Assembly, he said that Phase-I of the Chennai Metro Rail (45 km), was fully operational and the Phase-I extension up to Thiruvottiyur/Wimco Nagar would be completed by mid-2020. The government has already approved the implementation of three more Chennai Metro Rail corridors in Phase-II with a total length of 118.9 km, at an estimated cost of ₹69,180 crore.

“I urge the Centre to accord early approval for their participation in the Phase-II project on the 50:50 equity sharing model adopted for Phase-I,” the Governor said. Based on a feasibility study, the State government has decided to extend the Metro Rail Corridor by 15.3 km from Chennai Airport to Kilambakkam, where a new mofussil bus stand was coming up.

The Tamil Nadu government has also proposed to enter into a ‘Chennai City Partnership’ as a unique model of development co-operation with the World Bank with a goal to integrate the multiple transportation modes in Chennai and enable the seamless mobility of people in the city.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pmdqee/article29926277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09light-rail-projectcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rail-based-transit-system-to-be-built-between-tambaram-and-velachery-to-ease-congestion/article30493027.ece
365,2020/01/06,"Five months after it was dug up, East Avenue Road in Chennai’s Korattur, remains in a shambles","East Avenue Road, an arterial road connecting Korattur and Ambattur, has remained in a shambles for a few months now. Residents are having a tough time negotiating the limited space available on the damaged road.

The road, which is nearly 100 metres wide, is one of the few broad roads developed in the area. Residents of Korattur noted that the road was dug up for laying a pipeline to improve the underground drainage network in the neighbourhood five months ago. The trenches have been temporarily closed now, and a portion of the battered road has become a convenient space for parking vehicles, leaving motorists to use the limited space on the road.

Samuel Satish, a resident of Thillai Nagar, said the road is a significant stretch as many motorists use it as an alternate route to avoid traffic on Chennai Tiruvallur High Road. “This road connects traffic till Ambattur Red Hills Road and several residents from Pudur and Oragadam also travel by this road, besides Korattur residents. Traffic on the wide road has been reduced to a single lane for want of space,” he said.

S. Vedachalam, former Ambattur MLA, recalled that East Avenue Road was developed as part of a Tamil Nadu Hosuing Board colony in 1972. The infrastructure then was planned for about 1,400 houses. Sewage mixing with drinking water was often an issue on adjacent roads like 11th Main Road due to poor infrastructure. The nearly 500-metre stretch of the East Avenue Road has been dug up for the work.

Residents are demanding that the long-pending drainage work be completed soon and the road be re-laid for smooth flow of traffic.

Officials of Chennai Metrowater said the work to provide an underground drainage network in un-served areas was taken up last year and had to be stopped temporarily due to the Northeast monsoon in October.

“We plan to resume work around January 10 as the Greater Chennai Corporation has given us permission for road cuts. The network will be linked to the pumping station on East Avenue Road. The infrastructure will be improved in wards 84 and 86 and work will be completed in March,” an official said.

Admitting that much inconvenience has been caused to residents, an official said a portion of the road would be re-laid soon.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/l60yi3/article30492276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06JANTH-KORATTUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/five-months-after-it-was-dug-up-east-avenue-road-in-chennais-korattur-remains-in-shambles/article30492277.ece

367,2020/01/06,Woman killed in Choolaimedu as underground power cable bursts,"A 35-year-old woman in Choolaimedu was killed after an underground electric cable burst leading to a fire on Saturday night.

The Choolaimedu police said Lima Rose, wife of James, was residing on New West Street in Choolaimedu.

On Saturday night, she went to a shop near her house. While returning home, an underground power cable suddenly burst near the Andavar Street junction and sparks flew from a pillar box.

As the victim was standing near the pillar box, her nylon clothes caught fire and she suffered burn injuries, the police said. The woman suffered serious burns all over her body and was rushed by the locals to the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital for treatment.

As she had sustained more than 80% burns, she died on Sunday morning at the hospital not responding to treatment, officials said.

Tangedco officials said such fire accidents were rare after power cables were laid underground.

“A preliminary report has been sought to ascertain the cause of the pillar box accident,” said a senior official.

The officials faulted the various telecommunication agencies, who in the name of digging the road, damage the underground cables leading to such accidents.

The Choolaimedu Police have filed a case and are investigating if it was a case of negligence.

On Wednesday, two Tangedco workers were electrocuted while attending to a fault in a transformer in Sowcarpet.

369,2020/01/06,Reader’s mail,"Eateries only add to road damage

The Chennai Corporation has either failed to or has ignored to take into account the fast food eateries, as one of the contributors to the damage caused to roads.

It is a common sight on busy streets during late hours: the fast food eateries washing their premises and letting the wastewater onto the road which stagnates on the uneven surface, further damaging the road, and causing health and hygiene issues. The recent boom in small eateries has been causing a lot of nuisance to the public in many ways including indiscriminate parking, dumping of waste into the Cooum river canals and encroaching upon the platforms.

Hindering free flow of traffic

A large number of share autorickshaws are found parked in front of Anna University on Sardar Patel Road in the evenings. The share autos occupying a major portion of the service road hinders free movement of other vehicles during that time.Though a few traffic constables are posted near the main gate of the Anna University, they turn a blind eye to this problem.

These autorickshaws may be instructed to park a few metres away, thus leaving free the space in front of the main gate of Anna University.

Demand for relaying of Arya Gowda Road

Instead of relaying Arya Gowda Road completely, the Corporation had carried out only patch work and the road’s condition is back to being bad. The officials need to ensure that the road is properly relaid and they could do well by inspecting the work when it is being undertaken. With official supervision, the roads would be laid with quality material and hence would withstand traffic and rains for a longer period.

370,2020/01/06,Surya said that ‘Vidhyasamdhaan Azhagu’ would provide an insight to adults too,"The State government is taking steps to ensure students are skilled and have guidance on what to study after schooling, said Minister for School Education K.A. Sengottaiyan.

He was speaking at the release event of two books — Vidhyasamdhaan Azhagu, a collection of stories for children authored by S.Madasamy and Ulagam Pirandhadhu Namakkaga, a book on life skills for young students compiled by the Agaram Foundation.

“From next week, we will be offering English classes to students across schools to improve communication skills. There are many students who are confused after schooling. We are taking steps to tie up with industries to help with skill development of students,” he said.

Actor Surya, the founder of Agaram Foundation, said that they began work over 10 years ago with the aim of helping underprivileged students with access to education. “We have been working as a big family and there are several people and donors who have helped us sustain the work we do.” Speaking about Vidhyasamdhaan Azhagu, Mr. Surya said that the book would provide an insight not only to children but also to adults. “Every child is different and it is important to encourage their individuality which is what the book emphasizes on as well. Workshops on life skills and building self-confidence have been an important part of any student's journey with Agaram Foundation. The book is a compilation of the questions, discussions and thoughts shared during these sessions.” As a part of the event, students who have been aided in their education by the foundation shared their stories and Mr. Surya broke down on listening to the struggle of a student from Thanjavur district.

371,2020/01/06,Walk of a kind,"“Wearing glasses is one thing and being totally blind is another,” said Vishwas M. Shetty, who participated in a blindfolded walk on the IIT-M campus on Sunday.

The Master’s student at the IIT-Madras said he had to wear glasses to correct his short sight. But Sunday’s experience at the event called ‘a walk in the dark’ gave him a perspective of what his friend Vishnu, a visually challenged person, faces every day.

“It is all about trust. I am going wherever he [the volunteer guide] is taking me,” he said.

Jaichand R, a first year mechanical student of VIT Chennai, said: “It felt completely different. I have attended several rallies on my campus but nothing like this.”

Vinod Daniel, managing trustee, India Vision Institute, which organised the walk along with IIT-M’s Blink at the ongoing Shaastra 2020 festival, said the aim was to create awareness that people can see with glasses.

“We have a programme called ‘Eye See I learn’. One in 10 need glasses but in rural and tribal areas, the teachers hardly realise the issue and term these children dumb or slow,” he said. Among the elderly too, such issues persist and to address them the Eye See I learn campaign was launched.

IVI conducts such walks across the country and so far four lakh persons have been covered, he said. Students from optometry colleges and schools volunteered to be blindfolded. The students walked from the Central Lecture Theatre to Himalaya Mess.

Minister for Tamil official language K. Pandiarajan flagged off the walk. He along with his wife Latha and Australian Consul General Susan Grace also walked the distance blindfolded.

372,2020/01/06,"5,400 families in slums yet to be resettled","Of the 9,529 families in slums along the Adyar, 5,400 families are yet to be resettled. Owing to the “priority to the eco-restoration of the Cooum river”, the resettlement of families along the Adyar have been delayed.

The inspection by civic officials along the Adyar banks during this monsoon had led to resumption of the activity.

“We resettled 4,134 families immediately after the 2015 floods. In the past few years, resettlement of families along the Adyar has not been carried out. Houses will be built by the TNSCB in March. Resettlement may begin after March,” said an official. Work in some areas have been delayed after 700 families near Anakaputhur meander point went to court. Relocation will be taken up after construction of houses in TP Chatram and Perumbakkam. Even as many residents demanded widening of the river, officials said the river will not be widened “beyond the right of way.”

Work on flood protection walls near “breaching points” along the 42 km of the river remains a challenge.

The event was organised to support education for the underprivileged, special kids and training support for para athletes. Besides, the Chennai Runners, through SPCM 2020, have adopted the Kazhipattur Lake near Siruseri, as the primary charity cause.

The project envisages clearing of garbage, cleaning and rejuvenating the lake to restore it to its original glory and full storage capacity.

While Felex Rop from Kenya won the men’s full marathon and Suguna K from Rasipuram won the women’s full marathon.

374,2020/01/06,"Adyar eco-restoration gains momentum, at last","Residents in neighbourhoods along the Adyar were the worst-hit in the December 2015 floods.

After four years, the government has taken up inspection of the entire river course as part of the eco-restoration project and looking at all aspects of disaster management to prevent flooding.

While the initiatives are welcomed by residents living along the river, they are apprehensive over lack of communication with officials on key aspects of the project.

After civic officials kick-started the inspection of the river last month, covering a large number of residential neighbourhoods, residents have started demanding speedy completion of the projects to mitigate flooding.

Public consultation has always remained inadequate in such projects in various parts of the city.

For example, residents of Sri Nagar Colony in Saidapet have been demanding flood protection infrastructure to prevent inundation of their houses during monsoon.

The water level reached 10 feet in many houses in areas such as Sri Nagar Colony, Saidapet, Adyar, Jafferkhanpet, Manapakkam, K.K. Nagar and MGR Nagar during the December 2015 floods.

But the authorities have not been able to finalise the design of a flood protection infrastructure for Sri Nagar Colony, a part of which continues to be prone to flooding.

“We want flood protection wall with a proper design. After four years, we are yet to get assurance from officials that our area will not be flooded again,” said M. Raj, a resident of MGR Nagar.

According to sources, the work on eco-restoration of the Adyar will gain momentum as the monsoon is over.

“Most of the areas will get flood protection walls before the northeast monsoon in 2020,” said an official.

‘No benchmark’

Water expert S. Janakarajan said the eco-restoration projects seem to be “cosmetic”. “The problem is that they look at the river in patches. They start with Kotturpuram or Adyar or any other locality. But they do not have a benchmark.”

“The river should be restored to the original width, depth and along with floodplain as per the original settlement register. The interventions by the civic agencies will only be ad hoc. This is not eco-restoration. It is just cleaning up. They should survey the entire stretch of the river, the width, depth, elevation, topography and gravity. For example, a lot of building debris and silt have been obstructing gravity in areas such as Jafferkhanpet and Manapakkam and near the Airport,” said Mr. Janakarajan.

375,2020/01/06,Stories go to print 74 years after they were written,"The fifth volume of Kathaikovai, a collection of 117 short stories, has an interesting story behind it.

To be released on January 11 at the Chennai Book Fair by the Alliance Company, the stories were originally meant to be published in 1950, the golden jubilee year of the company.

But the founder V. Kuppuswami Iyer died in 1949 and they remained as manuscripts for 74 years.

“I decided to bring out a collection of 117 short stories in two volumes, and 14 long stories as a separate volume to mark the 117th anniversary of our publishing company,” said V. Srinivasan, the grandson of Kuppuswami Iyer, who published four volumes during his life-time.

The previously published four volumes had stories written by the best Tamil writers.

The first volume featured stories of U.Ve. Saminatha Iyer, Na. Pitchamoorthy, Ku.Pa.Rajagoplan, P.S. Ramaiah, Kothamongalam Subbu and many others.

“He (Kuppuswami) advertised in newspapers in 1946, inviting writers to send their stories for the fifth volume. He wanted to bring out the volume in 1950, but died a year before. Fortunately, the manuscripts remained with us and we are bringing out the stories,” said Mr Srinivasan.

Kuppuswami Iyer’s team of five writers — T.N. Kumarasamy, T.N. Senapathy, Ki.Va. Jagannathan. Ti.Ja. Ranganathan and Ka.Sree.Sree — had shortlisted the 117 stories.

He decided that the fifth volume should have stories by budding writers. The collection has stories written by Vikraman, Mu. Varadharajan (Mu.Va), Poornam Viswanathan, cartoonist Gopulu, Kousikarn and Athreyan.

“I wanted to bring out the volume in 2020 to mark the centenary celebration of our company. But I was not able to find a suitable person who will go through the manuscripts.

376,2020/01/06,Scoring a foreign policy self-goal,"The frightening fall of a great nation has begun. Once a leading light of inclusiveness, democracy, and a major pole of stability in the comity of nations, despite occasional failings, India today is embarrassingly at the centre of attention for bad behaviour. While the present government’s decisions on Jammu and Kashmir put the spotlight on New Delhi, the recently legislated Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or CAA, 2019 pushed it over the edge. Not only has the Act deeply divided a communally sensitive country, its effect is bound to have long-term implications for India’s foreign policy. India’s global standing is ever more vulnerable today, and the chinks in India’s diplomatic armour have never been so evident.

The essence of the CAA

But before we weigh the foreign policy implications, let us understand the CAA for what it really is. Shorn of the deliberate confusion and politically-convenient rhetoric, the CAA is neither about refugees nor about illegal immigrants, as the government would like to claim; it is about the Muslims in India. If you are an Indian Muslim with incontrovertible domicile documents, it is a message for you. If you do not have the requisite documents and you are Muslim, this is where you should be scared about your future.

Let us be clear: If the objective is to provide refuge to the persecuted, what we need is a proper refugee law with legally sound standard operating procedures on a par with global standards, and without discrimination. If it is about illegal immigration, the assumption — when one reads the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) together — that only Muslims can be illegal immigrants is a deeply problematic one.

Regional fallout

The present government’s zealous pursuit of the CAA citing human rights violations in the neighbourhood and illegal immigration from it is a foreign policy self-goal. Clearly, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could not have, if it were to derive domestic political utility from it, talked about illegal immigration to India without castigating Bangladesh, nor could it have pontificated about the human rights violations of non-Muslims in the region without pointing fingers at Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. It is such political expediency that has landed the government in an unenviable diplomatic spot today.

It would, however, be foolish of those of us who are outside the government to assume that the leadership did not foresee the negative fallout its policies and rhetoric on India’s relations with two of its best friends in the region, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, at a time when it does not have many friends in the neighbourhood.

But that is not the point. That the BJP leadership would have, most likely, foreseen the serious loss of diplomatic capital with these countries and yet gone ahead with its anti-neighbour rhetoric given its domestic political utility is what makes it singularly worrying. Put differently: the political bosses of the Indian government decided to sacrifice the country’s crucial foreign policy interests at the altar of domestic political contingencies.

This becomes a diplomatic double whammy given how India is already losing its traditional heft and influence in the region and at a time a China-led balance of power is emerging in the region. Once again, New Delhi is not unaware of it. On the contrary, South Block’s foreign policy mandarins are wary of the Chinese state’s sure-footed engulfment of the neighbourhood. And yet, the political bosses have preferred domestic political gains over diplomatic benefits, relegating foreign policy to the whims of electoral outcomes.

That from a foreign policy point of view the CAA is short-sighted is obvious, and that it will adversely affect India’s regional influence and standing is an unavoidable outcome; what is shocking is that the political leadership does not seem bothered by it. That is what should worry us.

Reputational costs

From Kashmir to the NRC to the CAA — one reckless action after another — New Delhi seems to have finally exhausted the goodwill of the international community. In December, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called the CAA “fundamentally discriminatory” — something unheard of in recent memory. Again in December, the United States, arguably India’s best friend today, urged the country to “protect the rights of its religious minorities in keeping with India’s Constitution and democratic values”. The same month too, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) referred to CAA as not only “highly discriminatory and arbitrary” but also contrary to New Delhi’s “obligations under international human rights laws”.

New Delhi’s attempts to reach out to the international community, albeit selectively, while assiduously avoiding those critical of its policies, have not met with much success. When India’s External Affairs Minister pulled out of a meeting with senior members of the U.S. Congress after U.S. lawmakers refused New Delhi’s demands to exclude Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal — she has been critical of the Indian government’s policies in Kashmir — the message that went out was that India is unable to justify its own policies. Or that it does not bother with what others think of it.

For a government that steadfastly shied away from internationalising domestic issues, its own actions have done precisely that thereby bringing lasting damage to the country’s reputation. Now, one might ask as to why a state should worry about its reputation and whether it is not enough to use one’s material power to achieve foreign policy outcomes. For one, the BJP has traditionally been more concerned about India’s reputation, at least as a rhetorical plank, than anyone else. Second, India’s traditional foreign policy pursuit has been a careful mix of soft power and material capability with the balance often tilting in favour of soft power. Finally, reputation, among other things, is critical in aiding India’s quest for a place at the high table of international politics, such as acquiring a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) seat.

More so, status quo powers, as opposed to revisionist ones, are far more favoured by the international order. India was the region’s quintessential status quo power that the world loved to engage and promote. This key characteristic of India may be undergoing a dramatic change, with many viewing India as a reckless power with revisionist ambitions — just as Pakistan has long been viewed.

Great power equations

India is a major power with great power ambitions and may even be an indispensable power in some respects. However, if India decides to shape its foreign policy based purely on domestic calculations, its indispensability and system-shaping abilities will take a serious hit. A great power, among other things, is a state that is willing to live up to certain global expectations and has the ability and willingness to help with system maintenance.

Great powers have traditionally been supportive of India’s rise in the global order and have more or less stood by India in its pursuit of power and reputation. This is bound to change thanks to the government’s domestic preoccupations. While the Trump White House may be indulgent towards New Delhi, at least for now, the patience of the Washington establishment is fast running out. If there is a Democratic government in Washington DC next year, things might get harder for New Delhi. Moscow’s unequivocal support for New Delhi is now a thing of the past, and New Delhi’s fall from grace suits Beijing more than anyone.

When was the last time we heard a mention of rising India? When was the last time someone “seriously” argued that India should be part of the UNSC? Our sheen has come off and the world is beginning to see the ugly realities within.

Moreover, thanks to the heavy political fire-fighting that it needs to do on a daily basis on issues such as Kashmir, the NRC, and the CAA, much of New Delhi’s diplomatic capital is spent on doing precisely that. Its focus on crucial regional and global issues seems to be waning fast. With little talk of renegotiating the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, no appetite to be part of the Afghan peace process, and disinterest in the Indian Ocean’s geopolitics, among others, the regime in New Delhi resembles a provincial capital today.

Meanwhile, the world is watching as we make a spectacle of ourselves.

Do the outfit’s members know that there are hundreds of thousands of Tamils working in several parts of north India? Have they bothered to find out what the consequences would be if similar outfits there were to drive the Tamils back to their home State?

378,2020/01/06,A whimsical act,"While the world grapples with the aftermath of a seemingly whimsical act by the U.S. in killing the commander of another sovereign nation, it is easy to be pulled into unwanted situations, as far as India is concerned. The attempt by U.S. President Donald Trump to invoke India is one such situation which needs to be handled with great caution and adroit diplomacy. Statements by Mr. Trump blaming the slain commander for “terrorist acts and plots” sound shallow without adequate proof. One sincerely hopes our diplomats know how to steer clear of the baits and pitfalls arising out of the situation. Traditionally, India and Iran have had a long history of love-hate relationship and the present situation could also lead to a new low. It would be wise for both nations to keep their heads still.

Yoganandh T.,

The U.S.’s misadventure can prove to be another strategic misstep by Washington in affairs of West Asia. This is nothing short of declaring war on Iran. In the times of a global economic slowdown, the mindless act of the big brother would lead the world community to the brink by affecting the supply and price of hydrocarbon fuels. The slain commander was instrumental in fighting against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. A strong retaliation from Iran is in offing. India too would have to bear the brunt.

D.V.G. Sankararao,

Vizianagaram, Andhra Pradesh

The mounting tension in West Asia following the assassination of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani by the U.S. is cause for concern for the international community. The killing has led to a highly volatile situation from which a full-scale war might develop. Looked at objectively, the U.S. is squarely responsible for the conflict and its escalation in the region.

It is legitimate to ask why there are U.S. troops in the region and no Iranian or Iraqi soldiers in the U.S. soil to understand who is violating the principle of sovereignty of nations with impunity. Just because of the U.S.’s pre-eminence on the international stage, we should not shy away from doing some straight talking.

As an imperialist power currently led by a bellicose President, the U.S. has brought West Asian region to the brink of war. The Donald Trump administration has pulled the country out of the Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed economic sanctions and sought ‘regime change’ in Iran. The country is duplicitous and speaks in a forked tongue; it says it favours de-escalation and talks and then threatens ‘to target 52 sites’ in Iran representing 52 Americans taken hostage on November 4, 1979. The series of tweets from President Trump cast him as a war-monger. There is a deep sense of loss and anger over the assassination of Soleimani as is evident from the chants of ‘Death to America’ and ‘We will take revenge’ and burning of American and Israeli flags by crowds of people in the funeral processions.

Pushed to the wall, Tehran could act in unpredictable and ingenious ways to defend itself from the U.S. aggression. The U.S. seems to think that anyone who seeks to resist its military and economic expansionism is expendable. For it, anyone who is not on its side in its pursuit of self-interest is a ‘terrorist’.

The international community must raise its voice against the U.S. for its rash and reckless acts like the assassination of Soleimani in the belief that the targeted countries cannot exact revenge because of its military might and rein it in through all possible means from destabilising the world and making it more insecure.

G. David Milton

The drone attack by the U.S. on a top Iranian Commander inside Iraq has followed a set pattern and, equally, the timing is tailored to suit the domestic political needs of the country’s President. When India carries out anti-insurgency operations, like those against rebels inside Myanmar and the Balakot strikes in Pakistan, the repercussions are also felt by India. The trigger-happy U.S., on the other hand, has been conducting raids on foreign countries located in other regions. Its own borders stay pristine while other nations bear the brunt, be it economic, political or social.

Sadly, the U.S. assumes the mantle of the sole printer of the world currency and the self-styled leader of the free world with little concern for the ensuing global disequilibrium or the collateral damage to innocent civilians. West Asia has been its favoured punching bag. If earlier, its interventions were aimed at ensuring a perennial inflow of crude oil, today, being a net exporter, it gains from climbing crude prices. The deep divisions among the U.S.’s adversaries adds to the hubris that results from the country’s military might.

R. Narayanan,

Navi Mumbai

The killing of Qassem Soleimani has raised a number of concerns about the consequences for the relationship between America and Iran and it will certainly not bring them any closer to a peaceful resolution. You can’t bomb yourself to peace. The imagery that President Trump is putting forward seems wrong to many. The surprise bombing is the modern-day equivalent of a sheriff shooting the bad guy in the back and that was never the way of the hero. Wars and any dispute need to be solved by words, not weapons.

382,2020/01/06,Fitso and Hudle: Bringing recreational sports back,"For both the millennial and the boomer, recreational sports often take a backseat after the school and college years. Staying active became another item on to-do lists. Taking this into account, two Delhi-NCR start-ups that have been piggy-backing off the ways that our everyday lives have changed, and continue to change. Fitso, which launched in 2015 and Hudle, which started in 2016, both look to recreate the communal relationship with sport.

Hud(d)le in

“Over the past 10 years, there’s been a boom in fitness, but the focus has been mostly on individualism. And it was boring,” says Suhail Narain, the founder of Hudle. After a masters degree in Sports Management from the University of Michigan, Narain worked in event management and marketing for three and a half years, before wanting to get back to his interest in sports. “And since my professional experience was in events, I married the two,” he says.

It was an idea whose time was come. There were already aggregators in the market — the restaurant aggregator Zomato, event-aggregator and ticketing platform, BookMyShow, Mumbai-based gym aggregator Fitternity. The progression towards a platform that made it easier for us to find and tap-to-participate in community sport was then natural corollary.

But it took close to two years of “groundwork”, he says before launching the digital platform late 2018. “In the beginning, companies would hire us to run a badminton tournament for example, for its employees,” he recalls. “In that time, we interacted with thousands of spaces and players. The disconnect we found was that spaces and facilities were run in an archaic way.” The launch of their digital platform was one way by which facilities could be made more accessible — problems like going all the way to a badminton court to find that it was already in use by regulars, could now be overcome through the app, where booking could be simplified. They currently cover tennis, football, badminton, and basketball.

Swim, too

The other reason that it was the right time for Hudle to launch was the demand that Fitso, launched a year earlier, was already seeing. The startup, founded by three IIT-ians Naman Sharma, 30, Rahool Sureka, 31, and Saurabh Aggarwal, 31, launched with their swimming pool aggregator vertical, called Fitso Seals. Their services included not only finding and booking pools and classes, but also a trained coach. They started with swimming as “swimming literacy” is low in India, says Sharma, and as a single-person sport, it would be easier to practise.

“Primarily, we’ve had to focus on the level of hygiene in washrooms, quality of water, and safety. Also, usually, coaches are not trained and certified – and those who are available are focused on only kids or elite athletes,” he says. They’ve built an in-house curriculum that takes best practises from around the globe.

Fitso, that claims to have trained 40,000 swimmers since its inception, has since also expanded to other sports including badminton, tennis, squash, table tennis, cricket, football, and basketball. They’ve taken a leaf out of international aggregators like ClassPass, making a program called MasterKey, currently operational only in Gurguram. Through this, they make available nine kinds of sports, their facilities, as well as coaches.

Going forward

In 2020, both startups want to make it easier for older people nurturning hesitations, to come back to spot. Further, boyued by their experience with the football infra boom in Vasant Kunj, Hudle wants to replicate their interventions into existing group-sport facilities — they will expand to the Kozhikode-Calicut region, which has “hundreds of football turfs,” says Narain. Currently, they operate in Mumbai and Jaipur too, covering 200 facilities. They hope to expand to 1,000 across five major cities, and then estimate to have close to 1.5 lakh players on the platform by the end of this year.

Since their pre series-A funding of $1.5M in early 2019, Fitso is focusing on expanding MasterKey to Hyderabad and Delhi, and launching in Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Pune. “Our target is to get to a 100,000 active users by March 2021,” says Sharma, recalling the 15,000+ active subscriptions they have currently. Other than this, the team aims to further embellish their app with gamification — leaderboards, challenges, and progress trackers, Sharma adds, “because sports thrives on engagement through competition.”

383,2020/01/06,Global Veganuary festival encourages people to go vegan for 31 days,"When Sangeeta Bahl summited Mount Everest in 2018 at the age of 54, to become the oldest Indian woman to do so, it was a matter of great joy. One niggling desire remained, however: the next summit she would peak, she vowed, would be as a vegan.

In July last year, she came close to fulfilling that wish. Although she was beaten by the weather before she could climb to the peak, Sangeeta spent 21 days on Mt McKinley in Alaska as a vegan and can’t wait to do it all over again. “My message is that it is possible to stay strong and get all the proteins you need from a plant-based diet. Mountaineering is no easy task, and if I can do that while consuming seeds, nuts and legumes, then the idea that vegans are weak is quite a fallacy,” she says, adding her digestion has improved and she feels more active than before.

That is the reason Sangeeta is the face of Veganuary, a month-long movement that encourages people to go vegan for 31 days, in January. It was started in 2014 in UK by Matthew Glover and Jane Land, gaining momentum each year with support from celebrities such as Joaquin Phoenix, Paul McCartney and Evanna Lynch. The idea is that for something to become habit-forming, it needs 21 days.

Sangeeta Bahl at a trek in Kashmir

Having spread to 179 countries so far, this is the second time it’s being celebrated in India. This year, The Vegan Samooh, a collective of vegan activists, is organising it.

What is Veganuary?

Outreach is the major focus of Veganuary, and just as important is changing the image of who a vegan is. “The issue is vegans are today looked upon as part of a cult,” says Akshita Kukreja, part of The Vegan Samooh, who is organising inclusive potlucks and parties to recolour that perspective. “We want people to realise that vegans can have fun. It’s not all about protesting, though that is a big part of it.”

Under Veganuary, she and her team organised a vegan-themed eco-conscious New Year’s party in Delhi. “We also wanted to bring together vegans and zero-waste activists through this,” she says. A significant portion of people registering for Veganuary are those worried about the impact of dairy and meat industries on climate change.

Much like how Veganuary is celebrated all over the world, in India too, The Vegan Samooh has teamed up with over 60 establishments, cosmetics and restaurants in seven cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune and Goa, to offer discounts on vegan products.

Recently, Akshita also organised a trip to an animal sanctuary in Delhi, where a vegan buffet was held, and at the same time, people could interact with rescue chicken, goats and cows. All this, she says, is an attempt to be inclusive, build a community, and get rid of the ‘elite’ tag. “The idea is that people make the connection between veganism and ethics themselves,” she says, adding that they’d like to change the image of vegans being pushy people.

30 days or more?

How sustainable is it though? Ontario resident Dev Vajaria explains how he could not keep up with his vegan lifestyle when he would visit India, “because of the limited availability of dairy substitutes like soy and almond milk.” But things are changing — in terms of 2019 participation numbers for Veganuary, India was the third country, after the UK and USA, and Mumbai the fifth city. Akshita points out that many Indian dishes are vegan by default, whether it’s rajma-chawal up North or idli, dosa and upma in the South. She says that some people see veganism as a western concept. “But a big part of The Vegan Samooh is to go back to our Indian roots of shak-ahar (plant-based diet).”

This year, the movement has had a growth spurt among the health-conscious, thanks to the Netflix documentary The Game Changers. A report by Veganuary UK says that globally nearly 49% of the participants listed health as a reason to go vegan.

“Being a mountaineer requires me to train intensively, and I can do it without getting my proteins from meat. In fact, since I have gone vegan, my digestion has improved and I feel more active than I was when I was 20,” says Sangeeta.

Founder of Bengaluru-based Right Living, dietitian Anupama Menon, says it is about making sure you have both complete and incomplete proteins. The latter is available in vegan products, but eggs, fish, dairy and meat is a rich source for the former. “Incomplete proteins are basically those that are lacking in some amino acids. Rice for instance, misses out on lysine. So you need to have it with dal, to get the complete protein.” Similarly, you need to find replacements for other nutrients such as iron, calcium and Vitamin B12.

She reminds us though that shifting to being vegan means giving up food groups that your body is used to, a shift it is likely to resist. It is important then, to pay attention to your gut health. If you have food allergies because of which you can’t eat peas, quinoa, certain legumes, almonds, gluten or certain oils, by going vegan you will be further limiting your nutrient sources. “If it has to become a sustainable lifestyle, you have to know if it is working for you as an individual, no matter what the studies on plant-based diets say.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/xjjhz0/article30494521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06mpvegan1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/veganuary-could-you-go-vegan-for-31-days/article30494523.ece
384,2020/01/06,Rujuta Diwekar on how to eat right in 2020,"Hello dear readers, wishing you a happy new year. How are you feeling today? Did you sleep well last night? Have you been complying with your exercise plans? Do you have sweet cravings post meals?

How many of us consider the above factors as a reflection of our health? But that’s what they are — surrogate measures of metabolic health — your hormonal health, cholesterol levels, kidney and liver function, gut health, and much more. However, the public health narrative is almost always about losing weight. Often, at the cost of health gain.

This is why we started the 12-week fitness project in the beginning of 2018. It was to reinforce common sense and put control back in the individual’s hands as far as health goes. More than 1.25 lakh people from over 40 countries participated and saw improvements in metabolic health parameters, inch loss from their waists and developed a better relationship with food.

Most importantly, the culturally compliant food and lifestyle modifications were sustainable, as most participants continued following them. Fitness doesn’t have to cost you the earth, literally. It’s 2020, climate change is a reality, and we need to go back to eating practices that were good for both people and the planet.

What follows is a cheat sheet to essential learnings from the 12-week fitness project, a fast-track version that will help you reset yourself in 10 days. It is uncomplicated, inexpensive, and more importantly, it’s easy.

It is independent of influencers, gadgets and the weighing scale — and is about improving health and losing weight as a consequence. Repeat that after me. Because that is exactly how metabolism works and not the other way around.

Most importantly, I promise you, that if you follow this eating plan for the next 10 days, you will report better sleep, less bloating, more energy, and be on the path to losing those inches in a sustainable manner.

Before we start, here are some ground rules Don’t start your day with tea/coffee

Eat home-cooked meals as often as possible

Eat your meals without your phone next to you

Structure your meals as follows: Pre-breakfast, breakfast, mid-morning snack, lunch, 4-6 pm meal, dinner

Patronise what grows around you, is in season and is cooked in your kitchen

Meal plan

1. Eat a banana or any other fresh fruit first thing in the morning. Or soaked almonds or soaked raisins. You can have a traditional home-cooked breakfast (idli, dosa, poha) about 45 minutes to an hour after this.

Why: Fitness is built one step at a time by small but daily actions. The body rewards consistency over anything else.

2. Add ghee to every meal — do this gradually if this is a new habit. So, add ghee to one meal first, then gradually increase. Put in as much as enhances the taste of the food and does not mask it. Also take into account the food item: Rice-dal, roti-vegetable will need lower quantities; puran poli, dal baati will need more.

Why: Ghee is the ultimate Indian superfood. It is a fat that breaks down other fats, is excellent for digestion, keeps joints healthy and skin glowing. Ghee also reduces sweet cravings.

3. Have a mid-morning snack. You can have a fresh fruit or a home-made laddoo or barfi (traditionally made as per season, with limited quantities of jaggerywinter specialties). Or a seasonal/home-made drink, such as coconut water, buttermilk, nannari, nimbu sherbet (with not more than 1 tsp sugar) etc.

Vegan or Keto? Recently, a headline declared that research has now proven that eating meat is not dangerous to health and that all these years we have been misled. They had looked at the same data as the studies which said limit meat intake and found their results to be statistically irrelevant. The keto community felt vindicated. On the other hand, the vegan community had lots to cheer about too. The documentary The Game Changers was successfully converting once hard-core meat eaters to plant-based diets. Virat Kohli even tweeted how he felt much better being a vegetarian athlete.

It’s really not about meat but eating it in a sustainable manner without it taking a toll on our body or the planet. So, if you are from a traditional meat-eating community, go back to the practice of eating meat sometimes, two to three times a week max and with rice or bhakri and sabzis, just like your grandmom taught you to. And if you are a vegetarian, don’t worry about protein, just eat your dals and pulses with rice and bhakris and sabzis, just like your grandmom taught you to.

Why: The Ayurvedic wisdom behind including these drinks during the day was to stoke the appetite, ease digestion and boost the immune system. They introduce diversity to your diet, allowing you to celebrate the season, eating roots, flowers and leaves.

4. The 4-6 pm meal is your most important meal of the day. Plan this as carefully as you would your lunch or dinner. You could eat a chapati with ghee and jaggery. Or choose between poha, upma, dosa, egg-toast, murukku or home-made coconut, gram or gond laddoo. If you have early dinners, then just have some groundnuts with jaggery.

Why: I always tell my clients that the key to losing weight lies in what they eat between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., a time when most of us are the most hungry and also the most careless in our eating. By eating something wholesome in the evening, you can eat a light dinner. This is the make-or-break meal, this decides whether you will have long-lasting fitness or whether it will fizzle out in the next couple of weeks.

5. For dinner, eat rice with sambar, rasam or dal and any vegetable you want to add. For the rice, pick hand-pounded or single-polished rice, instead of brown rice for your everyday use.

Why: This is easy to digest, and a complete meal. Rice and dal also improves sleep quality. It is suitable for people of all kinds of constitutions according to Ayurveda (vata, pitta and kapha doshas).

385,2020/01/06,JNU violence: TISS Teachers Association seeks impartial inquiry,"The Tata Institute of Social Sciences Teachers Association (TISSTA) has condemned the attack on students and teachers at the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Sunday. In a statement on Monday, it expressed solidarity with the Teachers’ Association and Students Union of the JNU and demanded an impartial inquiry into the attack. The association appealed to the Chief Justice of India to take suo motu cognisance of the attacks and summon the Delhi Commissioner of Police.

“We have issued a solidarity statement. By evening, we are also appealing to the Chief Justice of India and the National Human Rights Commission,” TISSTA president Bal Rakshase told The Hindu.

In the statement, the TISSTA stated that they learnt from media reports that the students at the JNU, who were protesting peacefully against the fee hike, the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register for Citizens within the university premises, were attacked by goons who had entered the campus armed with rods.

The association highlighted the string of “alarming increase in violent incidents in universities” over the past couple of months such as the Aligarh Muslim University, Jamia Millia Islamia University and in Mangaluru. “In all cases we have seen either police brutality or police inaction and in some cases the administration was inactive to take action against these goons. The academic freedom of students and teachers need to be restored so that academic fraternity can carry out their duties without fear,” the statement read.

The association said that it demanded an immediate, impartial and independent inquiry into the attacks, an inquiry into the inaction of the security personnel and administration during the attack. It further demanded that strict action be taken against the wrongdoers and that the university provide safety to its students, teachers and staff within its premises.

“We join all the others in appealing to the Chief Justice of India and the esteemed Supreme Court of India to take sou motto notice and summon the Commissioner of Police and direct the police to protect life and liberty of students, staff and teachers. Action must be taken on the mobs who attacked the students,” the statement read.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jr36dz/article30489149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BMJNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jnu-violence-tiss-teachers-association-seeks-impartial-inquiry/article30492210.ece
386,2020/01/06,8 hurt in fire in Kamathipura building,"At least eight people were injured in a fire in a residential-commercial structure in Kamathipura on Monday morning. The injured are stable and have been discharged. The structure partially collapsed during the fire.

The fire broke out in the ground-plus-one storey Cheena building around 9 a.m. Bystanders and neighbours rescued eight people soon after. The fire brigade categorised it as a level III (medium) fire and sent 10 fire engines to the site.

The fire was confined to electric wiring, electric installations and household articles in a leather warehouse in about 2,500 square feet on the first floor and a clothes warehouse on the ground floor.

Two to four units in the building were occupied by families while the remaining were commercial. Cracks had developed in the building and a portion collapsed in the fire, following which the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation had to demolish a larger portion, also to enable firefighting operations.

The evacuated structure will be demolished completely as it is beyond repair. The fire had also spread to a neighbouring building that shared a common wall. but only to one flat and was doused soon. Water and electric supply of this building has also been disconnected, it has been evacuated and its structural stability will be assessed before allowing people back inside. Meanwhile, residents of Cheena building have been provided temporary accommodation in a municipal school.

The injured are Chanda Devi (60), Adil Qureshi (20), Nisha Devi (32), Neha Qureshi (27), Mohanram (70), Ranjana Devi (24), Aniya (2) and Chandani Shaikh (25).

According to Ranjana Devi, residents were either asleep or busy in daily activities when the smoke began to rise. One of the men broke open a window and helped them out, which is why they did not sustain any severe injury.

Resident Chanda Devi said, “It was sheer luck and God’s grace that we survived.”

Police and fire brigade personnel rushed to spot after they received a call around 9 a.m., said senior police inspector of Nagpada police station Shalini Sharma. The ground floor was used for shoe-making and bag repair, and the chemicals and oil stored in the drums may have led to the fire, she said. “The building was almost 100 years old. The fire has damaged the wood the building was composed of, which is why I don’t think can anyone stay there any more.”

The cause of fire is under investigation, said Ms. Sharma.

“The patients initially suffered breathlessness and discomfort because of the smoke and because they fled and ran from the site of fire. However, all of them took discharge against medical advice around 2 p.m.,” said Dr. P.S, Agal, associate dean of Nair Hospital. All the victims received symptomatic treatment, he said.

“The cessed building was an authorised structure but whether the commercial units had necessary permissions will have to be checked,” said assistant municipal commissioner of D ward Prashant Gaikwad. The structure cannot be saved as it may collapse. The neighbouring building will also be audited, he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/duwsa9/article30492189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUMBAIFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8-injured-in-fire-at-mumbai-commercial-building/article30492190.ece
387,2020/01/06,"‘This fight is about thoughts, not religion, caste or language’","“I am proud to call myself a Muslim, and I am more than proud to say that I am an Indian. Nobody can snatch away both my identities,” said former Jawaharlal Nehru University student and social activist Umar Khalid while speaking at an event against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the city on Sunday.

The event, organised by Chhatra Bharati, a student organisation, was held at YB Chavan Centre. Organisers said the objective of the conference was to “fight an Act which hampers the Constitution and to spread awareness among the masses, mainly the youth.”

Apart from Mr. Khalid, the event was attended by State Minister for Education Varsha Gaikwad, MLC and Lok Bharti founder Kapil Patil, and activists Salman Imtiaz, Pradeep Narwal, Rama Naga, Hammadur Rahman, Sadiya Shaikh, Bhatta Ram and Ravindra Medhe.

The event started with Yalgaar Cultural Group’s rendition of three protest songs, including ‘Hum Dekhenge’.

“This fight is about thoughts and not about any particular religion, caste, gender or language,” Ms. Gaikwad said, adding, “The saddest part is that the government is not concentrating on issues like unemployment, inflation, health and sanitation, failure of GST and demonetisation, and decreasing women’s safety. Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi has no time to tweet for girls who were brutally raped and murdered but, after every speech of Smriti Irani he has all the time to tweet ‘Satyamev Jayate’.” She also said the citizens of India would never forgive someone who tries to change the Constitution.

Mr. Patil said, “When students start fighting the wrong, you should know that it’s time for you to empty the throne.”

Mr. Khalid began his speech by replying to Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan’s tweets by saying, “Mind your own business. Indian Muslims can take care of themselves.” He also said that Prime Ministers of both the countries should take care of what is happening in their own countries, rather than pointing out each other’s flaws.

Mr. Khalid said Indian Muslims’ ancestors were buried in this land and therefore they would never leave this country. He went on to say that the entire idea of Pakistan is based on religion but in case of India it is its secularism and diversity. He also questioned the groups protesting in favour of CAA, NRC and NPR since the ruling regime is already in favour of these Acts. “Violence and creating havoc is their only motto,” he said.

Shiv Sena’s Aaditya Thackeray, NCP’s Rohit Pawar and eminent writer Javed Akhtar were also supposed to attend the event but did not turn up.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/w5e1wj/article30491137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BMCAASEMINAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/this-fight-is-about-thoughts-not-religion-caste-or-language/article30489218.ece
388,2020/01/06,Severed head found on railway tracks in Kurla,"A severed head, believed to be of the woman whose torso was found in Ghatkopar last month, was found in Kurla on Sunday.

The body, with its lower legs and head missing, was found near Kirol Village close to Vidyavihar on December 30, while the legs were found a day later in the same locality.

Police officials said the head was found on the railway tracks close to the Kurla stretch of the Santacruz-Chembur Link Road. The police suspect it was thrown on the tracks from a bridge passing overhead, late on Saturday.

Senior police inspector Kusum Waghmare said, “The place where we found the head is very close to the place where we had found the torso. It is highly likely that the head might belong to the victim in our case.”

The police have sent the head to Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar so it can be medically verified if it belongs to the same person whose body parts have been found so far. “We had preserved the fingernails of the deceased to help with DNA identification. They will be compared against the DNA samples taken from the head,” Ms. Waghmare said.

Doctors at the hospital had earlier told the police that it took at least three attempts for the murderer to successfully chop the head off the torso. An officer from the Ghatkopar police station also said a special team had been working to locate the head ever since the torso was found.

“We conducted search operations in several areas, including Kurla, Sakinaka, Ghatkopar and Powai to look for the head. We suspect that the murderer has been discarding the body parts one at a time to keep us looking. The locations where the parts were found also indicate that the murderer is either from the same area or knows it well. It would have been particularly difficult to discard a human head which has been decomposing for the last six days without being caught,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/55zvrv/article30489184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06BMGhatkopar-murder,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/severed-head-found-on-railway-tracks-in-kurla/article30489185.ece
389,2020/01/06,Two of a gang responsible for 80% heroin supply in Mumbai held,"The Anti Narcotics Cell (ANC) of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch has arrested two members of a cartel, allegedly responsible for 80% of the heroin supply in the city. ANC officers have also seized heroin worth ₹12 crore from them.

According to the officers, the accused have been identified as Rajesh Joshi (50) and Krushnamurti Kawander (42), both residents of Mumbai. Officers said they had been working on busting this gang for the last six months.

“Mr. Joshi and Mr. Kawander are at the second and third position in the gang hierarchy respectively. Mr. Joshi receives the heroin, which is sent from Rajasthan, and passes it on to Mr. Kawander, who then distributes it among the gang’s customers. Between them, the two men were carrying 6 kg of heroin when we intercepted them near Malad railway station on Saturday night,” Deputy Commissioner of Police Shivdeep Lande, ANC, said.

He said the head of the gang is based in south India, and the accused handle everything in Mumbai on his instructions. Efforts are still being made to get an exact fix on his location, with help from the local police and Central agencies. Officers said the gang had a wide customer base of drug peddlers from south Mumbai and the western suburbs.

“Mr. Kawander has worked out a system through which the drugs reach his clients within an hour and a half of them being delivered to him by Mr. Joshi. The system was in place to ensure that the two did not have the drugs on themselves for longer than necessary and can hence avoid being caught. According to our inquiries so far, there are at least four other layers of manpower working under Mr. Kawander,” an ANC officer, who was part of the operation, said.

The police are now trying to find out the people involved in the transportation of the drugs and the modus operandi. “Mr. Joshi, who was the sole receiver of every consignment, has not been cooperative in the interrogation. We are going through his call detail records to see if the last dialled numbers or his cellular movements on Saturday night can throw up any clues,” the officer said.

The duo has been charged under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lqy9bl/article29168174.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMDRUGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-of-a-gang-responsible-for-80-heroin-supply-in-city-held/article30489169.ece

The small group soon swelled to about 300 people — some with candles, all with their mobile phones — and with their voices echoing in protest. An initially silent meeting started singing and reciting poetry as the number of youths increased.

Several attendees requested everyone present to not to talk to the media — as this is was a protest meeting for JNU. Many young people shared poems, all in peace, and Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s poem ‘Hum Dekhenge’ was recited.

392,2020/01/06,"Making hope possible, not despair convincing","Is it possible to retain hope when charlatans dictate our terms of engagement with the world of the arts and ideas? This was the question I had to encounter during a documentary film festival in Chennai where I paraphrased the Welsh writer and academic Raymond Williams and said that the mission of journalism and documentaries “is to make hope possible rather than despair convincing”.

The participants of the film festival were concerned about many things, but they were particularly agitated about the Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur’s decision to form a panel to examine whether the poem, “Hum Dekhenge”, by the celebrated poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz was indeed communal and hurt sentiments. This panel was formed after a temporary faculty member, Vashimant Sharma, and 16 others complained against the students for reciting the poem in support of the students of Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi. If an exemplary artist of the stature of Faiz can be shoehorned into a narrow communal jacket, many tend to believe that despair is the reality of the moment.

However, when the media highlighted the absurdity of the complaint, the management was forced to retract its original position. Talking to this newspaper, the IIT’s Deputy Director, Manindra Agrawal, said that the panel is not going to determine whether sentiments were hurt or not, but would only investigate if there was any “deliberate mischief”. This climbdown in the present environment of impunity is a testimony to the power of journalism as a site of hope rather than as a megaphone of despair.

The power of Urdu

My linguistic skills are restricted to just two languages, English and Tamil. I have no knowledge of Urdu. But I was moved by the power of Urdu verses not once but twice in 2005. I was based in Kathmandu when Nepal was going through its worst political crisis, the royal coup. I watched as King Gyanendra dismissed the government and restored an absolute monarchy. He suspended the fundamental rights of Nepali citizens, including the freedom of opinion and expression, the freedom of the press and publications, the right to information, the right to constitutional remedy, and the right to property. Similar to what is happening in Kashmir now, a communication blackout was imposed across the country.

‘Speak’

This did not deter senior journalists in Nepal from assembling at the Yalamaya Kendra in Patan to formulate ways and means to keep the public informed of what was happening despite the draconian measures taken by the royalty. I was invited to join the deliberation and, unlike what is happening in India today, not seen as an alien poking his nose in the domestic affairs of a foreign country. Kanak Mani Dixit, a senior editor and regular contributor to this newspaper, invoked Faiz Ahmed Faiz in a moving manner. Armed with the brilliant multimedia production of Faiz’s major poems by the Dawn group of publications, Mr. Dixit rendered the poem “Bol (Speak)” and explained how Faiz made the blazing smithy a symbol of the freedom movement during colonial rule. Here is the English translation of the lines that moved me:

“Speak — your lips are free,

Speak — your tongue is still yours

Speak — your life is still yours

Look inside the smithy —

Leaping flames, red-hot iron.

Padlocks open their jaws.

Chains disintegrate.

Speak — there is little time

But it is enough

Before the body perishes

Before the tongue atrophies.

Speak — truth still lives.

Say what you have to say.”

In a year when the resistance cascaded into what Nepalese political historians call the Jan Andolan-II, another brilliant poem of Faiz ,“Soldier’s elegy”, was used to create a space for reconciliation after a decade of civil war. If Faiz can help restore democracy in our neighbourhood, he can do so here too.

393,2020/01/06,Mind-numbing continuity,"The king of Armenia was fond of listening to stories. Storytellers would come in droves to his palace and he would listen to tales for days without end. Every storyteller would be rewarded handsomely.

Soon the king’s craze for stories peaked and he made an announcement. Anyone who told him an endless story could marry the princess. But the terms were rigorous. The story must be concluded only at the king’s request. If the end came before this, the storyteller would be sent into exile.

The offer lured many a storyteller. Some went on for two or three days while others stayed on the scene for a week. What they realised was that they had miscalculated the king’s zeal for stories. The end of the story always came much earlier than when the king wished for it. So all the stories ended with the storytellers being exiled.

Final contender

Then one day, there came a storyteller from a distant village which lay on the Iranian border. Courtiers who got wind of the new fortune-seeker stepping into the kingdom tried to dissuade him from approaching the king. But he could not be discouraged. Instead, he wanted to add on to the prize of the king’s daughter as well as half of the kingdom. The king pledged to this and the man began his story.

“Beyond the high mountains of the Urals lay a vast kingdom. Several mighty rivers descended from the high ranges and made their way to the fertile plains. The people in the plains were hard-working and harvested crops thrice a year. Soon, the nation was overflowing with grains. The king ordered a large granary to be built. It was a mile long and half that wide and rose up to 30 feet in height. The surplus grains was to be stored there. The farmers brought bags of rice, wheat, pulses, oats and sorghum. The stacks went up to the ceilings and the store was full. Some air passages were left in the walls near the ceilings.

A sparrow that lived in the vicinity soon made a foray into the storehouse through the air passage and pecked at a gunny bag. She carried away a few grains in her beak and fed her young ones.

She flew into the storehouse again, whirrr…picked a few grains and flew off to her nest. whurrr....the grains were fed to the young ones.”

She flew into the storehouse yet again, whirrr…. . picked a few grains and flew off to the nest, whurrr….”

For the rest of the day the story-teller continued with the “whirrr…. and whurrr”. The king soon got tired. He asked him to tell the story faster. The story teller said: “Your Majesty! The bird has not picked even a thousand grains. How can I narrate the story faster?”

The “whirrr… and whurrr” continued for a week. The king was thoroughly disgusted but knew he would lose a lot were he to request the man to stop. He could however, ask the story-teller to proceed faster. But, the storyteller would come up with his stock answer: “Your Majesty! So much of grain still lie in the bags. The chicks have to grow and join their mother in the effort.”

The continuous “whirrr… and whurrr” of the storyteller began to tell on the king’s nerves. He began to feel giddy. A fortnight later, only a couple of bags of grain had been picked. The end was nowhere in sight.

The king said to himself: “Enough is enough! I cannot take it anymore.” He could buy his silence only by surrendering half his kingdom, and that he was willing to forego.”

The king asked the the storyteller stop his story, much before the story itself finished. As a reward he won half the kingdom and the hand of the princess.

The king was consoled by the fact that his son-in law was a king and no longer a storyteller.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/ipahw2/article30494705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-YT-SHORT-STORY1,https://www.thehindu.com/children/mind-numbing-continuity/article30494706.ece

“We need more players,” said their cousin, Rudra. “It’s boring to play cricket this way.” He threw down his bat. They were in the backyard.

“Where are the other kids?” asked Dharti.

“Nobody wants to play with you,” said Rudra, in his matter of fact tone.

“Why is that? We play cricket well,” said Akash puzzled.

“It’s not that. The kids don’t speak any English, they are shy.”

“Well, I am shy too,” said Dharti. “Everything is new for me. I am just learning Kannada.”

Akash was upset. It was hard to make friends.

“I’m only playing with you, because Ajji promised me rava laddoos if I do,” he added making them feel worse.

Exchange students

That night, Akash and Dharti went to bed feeling miserable. When Akash was packing his bag for school the next day, he spotted a book on the table — LearnKannada in 30 Days. It gave him an idea.

“I know! Let’s start an exchange programme — learn English and Kannada class. We can teach each other,” he said excitedly.

“I think it’s a stupid idea,” said Rudra, when asked. “Nobody wants to sit in a class after school.” He picked up his bat and wickets and left. “Ajji’s laddoos are over. I will come when she makes a new batch.”

The idea was great. Akash put up a flyer in the school. The teacher was delighted and gave them pens and paper. Ajji spoke to some parents.

Slowly kids began to trickle in. The class was held under a tree. They practised sounds, told stories, and sang songs. Ajji and other adults chipped in when they had time.

Every evening sounds of A for Apple, B for Ball alongside … a, aa, e, ee rent the air. Some children came up with a dance to learn the Kannada alphabets. The adults were impressed.

“I want to be a teacher too, after all I know both English and Kannada,” said Rudra. He was feeling left out. He turned out to be a good teacher — a natural. Everyone began to converse in English and Kannada. Mistakes were made. But it was fun.

And the best part of the class was that, it always ended with games.

395,2020/01/06,Nabard going full steam ahead with digitisation initiative,"The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard), under its ‘eShakti’ initiative, has so far digitised records of around 4.55 lakh self-help groups (SHGs), covering 75 districts in the country, Padma Raghunathan, Chief General Manager of Nabard, Chennai, said.

Speaking at a stakeholder meeting on eShakti digitisation of SHGs, she said the initiative was started as a pilot project in two districts in 2015 and subsequently extended to 75 more districts in the country. The project now covers 250 districts in the country.

As part of the initiative, banks have collated data of around 3,175 SHGs in Puducherry. The individual data linking their Aadhaar and mobile numbers have been mapped and banks given viewing rights of the activities of each group. This will help banks view the groups’ activities and sanction loans from the branches, she said.

Addressing issues

Ms. Raghunathan said digitisation addressed issues like the quality of book keeping, multiple membership of SHG members, patchy credit histories and provides grading report of any SHG based on its financial and non-financial records, at the doorsteps of all stakeholders.

Uma Gurumoorthy, District Development Manager, Nabard, said over 4.55 lakh groups were covered across the country under the eShakti initiative with a cumulative savings of ₹2,588 crore. The credit linkage has improved from 38% to 55% thus proving the success of the project in catering to the credit needs of the poor, she said.

398,2020/01/06,Puducherry CM ‘quashes’ Kiran Bedi’s order,"In what could trigger a major showdown between the Puducherry government and the Raj Nivas, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has issued an order declaring as “illegal” and “null and void” an order of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi annulling the appointment of State Election Commissioner T.M. Balakrishnan.

“The appointment of State Election Commissioner of Puducherry is an executive action but his removal can only be through a legislative action as referred in Article 243 K, 243 L & 243- ZB of the Constitution of India, Sec 9(A) of Puducherry Village and Commune Panchayat Act and 15 (A) of Puducherry Municipalities Act,” the order dated January 3 said.

The CM also directed Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar to ignore Ms. Bedi’s earlier order. Mr. Narayanasamy’s order comes amid his sharp differences with Ms. Bedi on the status of the SEC appointment. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) recently directed the government to appoint the SEC after “due process” and in a transparent manner.

Ms. Bedi claimed that this was an endorsement of her order cancelling the appointment, as the MHA had directed the Chief Secretary to select an officer by an open selection and not nomination as done by the CM.

However, Mr. Narayansamy categorically ruled out any going back on the appointment, as the MHA, in its order, has not cancelled the appointment.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/v4zrnz/article30488758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05NARAYANASAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-cm-quashes-kiran-bedis-order/article30488759.ece
399,2020/01/06,"Officials help elderly man, who was ill-treated, regain bequeathed property","A 71-year-old man in Namakkal has regained a property he had bequeathed to his grandson, thanks to the efforts put in by officials of the district administration.

V. Nallasami had a house in Natarajapuram, where he stayed with Vasudevan, one of his three sons. Recently, Mr. Nallasami petitioned the District Collector, requesting that a will, providing for the transfer of ownership of the property to his grandson, be nullified.

In the petition, Mr. Nallasami alleged that Mr. Vasudevan used to ill-treat and attack him in an inebriated condition.

The petition, submitted to the district administration in October, was referred to Namakkal Revenue Divisional Officer M. Kottai Kumar. Following inquiries, the official found the petitioner’s claims to be true.

The authorities then took steps to invalidate the will under the provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.

According to revenue officials, after Mr. Nallasami transferred the property to his grandson's name, Mr. Vasudevan's attitude towards him changed. Mr. Nallasami’s son attacked him in an inebriated state and asked him to leave the house. “Mr. Vasudevan also asked his siblings not to visit the house. Based on the complaint, we have now issued orders to declare the will void, and had returned the documents to Mr. Nallasami on Saturday,” Mr. Kumar said.

The official added that the property was worth ₹2 crore. Mr. Nallasami was living in the ground floor, while Mr. Vasudevan and his family were living in the first floor.

“We have now instructed Mr. Vasudevan and his family to vacate the house within a certain period. We have issued an order to the local inspector to ensure Mr. Nallasami’s safety.

400,2020/01/06,"Now, Puducherry CM quashes Lt. Governor’s order","Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy has set out the grounds on which the Lt. Governor’s order on State Election Commissioner was declared illegal and void.

One of the key provisions cited in the Chief Minister’s order is Article 243K (Elections to the Panchayats), stipulates that the “superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls for, and the conduct of all elections to the Panchayats shall be vested in a State Election Commission consisting of a State Election Commissioner to be appointed by the Governor.

Subject to the provisions of any law made by the Legislature of a State the conditions of service and tenure of office of the State Election Commissioner shall be such as the Governor may, by rule determine.

Provided that the State Election Commissioner shall not he removed from his office except in like manner and on the like ground as a Judge of a High Court and the conditions of service of the State Election Commissioner shall not be varied to his disadvantage after his appointment”.

Another relevant provision the order cited was Article 243L- Application to Union Territories which states: The provisions of this Part shall apply to the Union territories and shall, in their application to a Union Territory, have effect as if the references to the Governor of a State were references to the Administrator of the Union Territory appointed under 239 and references to the Legislature or the Legislative Assembly of a State were references, in relation to a Union Territory having a Legislative Assembly, to that Legislative Assembly”.

The order refers to Article 243-ZB, “Application to Union Territories” that states “the provisions of this Part shall apply to the Union Territories and shall, in their application to a Union Territory, have effect as if the references to the Governor of a State were references to the Administrator of the Union Territory appointed under Article 239 and reference to the Legislature or the Legislative Assembly of a State were references in relation to a Union Territory having a Legislative Assembly, to that Legislative Assembly.

401,2020/01/06,Lax enforcement of rules causing traffic chaos,"Haphazard parking and blatant violation of traffic rules have become the bane of the city. The one-way rule on several stretches in the city is never followed, thanks to poor enforcement by the traffic police.

One-way rule exists only on paper on Ambalathadayar Madam Street, Rangapillai Street, Kokku Park junction and Vellala Street.

The arterial Jawaharlal Nehru Street housing several commercial establishments is the latest addition to the list. Although there is no time restriction for the rule, motorists presume they can enter the wrong lane after 10 p.m.

The flow of vehicular traffic on J.N. Street during peak hours has slowed down considerably. With cars parked along both sides of the road, the space available for vehicles has shrunk considerably.

“Poor planning is the reason behind the problems facing the city. The authorities tend to come up with short-term solutions rather than addressing the future needs of the city,” said N. Vaithianathan, a resident of Saram.

Although the traffic police introduced alternate parking rule every six months, very few adhere to the law. Popular shopping areas such as Villupuram Road, Anna Salai, Kamaraj Salai and Bussy Street suffer from the menace.

“There has been a phenomenal rise in the number of vehicles, particularly two-wheelers in the last few years. This necessitated introduction of one-way rule in important segments. But the one-way rule is violated with impunity. Although signboards have been erected indicating the one-way rule, it is not adhered to,” says S. Nadarajan, a resident.

Haphazard parking

Businessmen from Tamil Nadu are regular visitors to the city on Sundays. They park their vehicles wherever they want and are not fined. There should be strict enforcement of traffic rules and spot fine should be collected, he said.

Shortage of manpower in traffic police wing has added to the difficulty in managing the traffic. Puducherry is marked as a commercial centre and the house owners let out a portion of their buildings for shops and establishments. This has increased the density of traffic.

“When there is violation of rules, there is no intervention by the police. And when the police swing into action on certain days, they do so only for the sake of it. The traffic police, though hard-pressed for manpower, might need to deploy personnel on arterial stretches to ensure that parking rules are enforced strictly,” said U. Selvi, a resident of Gnanapragasam Nagar.

“The revised new traffic penalties for violation of road rules are yet to be notified and the government is working on it. Traffic police have been conducting frequent drives and notices are sent through the court. Adherence to traffic rules is necessary to ensure smooth traffic flow in the city. The active participation of citizens is important in this,” said a senior police official.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/n8m7uh/article30488666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THUTMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/lax-enforcement-of-rules-causing-traffic-chaos/article30488667.ece

405,2020/01/06,Govt. mum on expanding Montessori-based education,"Neither the School Education Department nor the Social Welfare Department has received a formal communication from the government on expanding the ambit of Montessori-type LKG/UKG education for children of 4 to 6 years in anganwadis, according to officials.

Last year, 88 anganwadis attached to government middle schools in Tiruchi district commenced the Montessori-based teaching system for LKG and UKG levels. State-wide, the system was started in 2,381 anganwadi centres with 52,933 children.

A senior official of the Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal said there has been no communication yet from the government on expanding the scheme in anganwadi centres through deployment of surplus secondary grade teachers. As per official figures, 5,934 Secondary Grade Teachers in Aided Primary/Middle Schools and 1979 Secondary Grade Teachers in Panchayat Union/Government/Municipal/Primary and Middle Schools were posted to the anganwadis and were being imparted with simultaneous training under SSA.

Preferably, surplus women teachers have been deployed and in case of non-availability of women teachers, male teachers have been posted.

On their part, primary school teachers' associations are not certain whether the government had taken a wise decision in posting surplus secondary grade teachers to anganwadis, citing dwindling student strength.

“The need for quality pre-primary education was never in question. But, the government ought to have appointed teachers qualified for Montessori system of training in the anganwadis rather than dislocating teachers in primary schools,” C. Arockiaraj, Tiruchi District Unit of Tamil Nadu Primary School Teachers Federation, said.

The premise of the government is that the children from these anganwadis will patronise government schools. But, there is no certainty that children in LKG/UKG classes in anganwadis will be enrolled in the panchayat union primary schools, at a time when there is an option for the parents to derive the benefit of free primary education in better-equipped private schools under the Right To Education (RTE) Act, Mr. Arockiaraj said.

According to government officials, the surplus teachers posted to the anganwadis are being imparted with training to handle classes for LKG and UKG levels befitting the Montessori style of teaching.

Though the teachers are under the administrative ambit of the Department of Social Welfare, their professional performance is monitored by the respective head of the middle school to which the anganwadis are attached.

The incident occurred on Sunday during the distribution of Pongal gift hampers to beneficiaries which was attended by Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar. Present at the function were the Gandarvakottai MLA B. Arumugam, Collector P. Uma Maheswari and AIADMK party functionaries.

In the video clip circulated on the social media platform, MLA Arumugam could be heard purportedly chiding District Supply Officer Akbar Ali and asking the latter to leave the stage.

Another AIADMK functionary is also seen allegedly abusing the officer who silently left the stage.

All these happened even as Health Minister Vijaya Baskar was distributing the assistance.

Official sources said the District Supply Officer was the returning officer for the Kundrandarkoil panchayat union ward members and posted at the counting centre in Keeranur.

The sources said the AIADMK wanted the returning officer to conduct recounting of votes for district panchayat ward 3 coming under Kundrandarkoil union.

The recounting was taken up on Monday after two persons turned up, with “election certificates,” for taking oath as councillor of the ward.

According to official sources, P. Kumar, was declared elected as councillor of the ward after the recount on Monday.

Innovative idea of converting an abandoned mini-water tank into a garbage bin, well maintained community/public toilets, neat and clean public areas such as bus stand, auto/taxi stands and installation of cost effective and durable cement twin-bins on the streets during the year under review (2019) has pushed the zonal level rank of this town panchayat from 190 in 2018 to 36 in 2019, official sources claimed.

Though bins were installed in the town area, the door-to-door collection of segregated waste from the households and the bulk waste generators such as traders / hoteliers / marriage halls etc. has helped the civic body authorities in maintaining the town as a litter free zone.

The Uyyakondan canal, said to have been built by Raja Raja Cholan nearly 1,000 years ago from the Cauvery near Pettavaithalai to a 70-km length up to Vazhavanthankottai tank, used to irrigate about 32,000 acres of agricultural land in the district.

Now, the canal has been polluted by drainage channels across the city, the volunteers say.

The volunteer group has set up signboards conveying the history and benefits of the canal, painted the walls of the bank with colourful paintings and even set up a children’s park with play materials made of discarded tyres painted in various hues, an 800-metre walking track with fence along Uyyakondan (north bank) with provision for water percolation, and a model sewage treatment plant.

This year, they have formulated an ABC plan- Awareness, Bank Restoration and Cleansing of water. “The youth are now taking interest in this initiative and we are channelling their contributions. We have appointed coordinators for each plan and will be working towards it for the next 52 weeks,” said Manoj Dharmar, a volunteer.

A website outlining the history, map of the Uyyakondan canal and also weekly updates on our work will be uploaded. “We are aiming to create awareness through social media,” he said. “Competitions such as elocution, drawing for school children and short film making, photography, etc., for college students is in the works,” Mr. Dharmar said.

“The main reason is the young people in the city are not aware about the historic uniqueness of the canal. They assume that it is a drainage channel.

The park will feature a walkway, an indoor and outdoor play area, an artificial fountain, walkways with green canopy, and plants with name boards including their scientific names. An important feature of the park is a sheltered yoga arena where visitors can practice yoga and other exercises.

“There is also an indoor stadium where meetings or small gatherings can be held,” the official said. Other facilities, include CCTV cameras, LED lights, fan fixtures in the yoga arena, sprinklers, cabin for security guards, drinking water and restroom facilities.

The civic body is also mulling over the idea of including more features in the park, using its general fund. “We are looking to make the park a ‘go to’ place for visitors. We are in talks with contractors and might include some additional features in the upcoming days,” the official said.

Preserving and developing open spaces - parks, playgrounds, and recreational spaces - in order to enhance the quality of life of citizens, reducing the urban heat effects in these areas and promoting eco-balance in smart cities is an important aspect of urban planning.

The provision of green space and re-development of the park began in December 2018 and will soon be completed, officials say. “The inauguration is expected to be done around Pongal”, P.

415,2020/01/06,ISL | JFC gets Spanish forward Grande,"Jamshedpur FC has signed in Spanish forward David Grande in an effort to tidy its attack in the second phase of the Indian Super League.

Seeing a dip in its performance following injuries to other two Spaniards in the attack — forward Sergio Castel and play-maker Piti — the Jamshedpur-based side decided to go for fresh shopping in the international winter transfer window.

Grande was signed in from the Segunda B Division Club Unionistas de Salamanca in the Spanish league, where he had scored nine goals in 18 appearances in the ongoing 2019-20 season.

The Spaniard began his career with Albacete in 2012-13 season, and went on to play for Getafe II, Lealtadd, Granada II, Ponferradina and Malaga II, all in Segunda B, before joining Unionistas.

416,2020/01/06,Germany World Cupper Tilkowski passes away,"Former Germany goalkeeper Hans Tilkowski, who conceded a controversial Geoff Hurst ‘ghost-goal’ at the 1966 World Cup final, has died at the age of 84, his family told SID on Monday.

During the England-West Germany final at Wembley, Tilkowski, who made 39 international appearances, was beaten by Hurst’s shot which hit the cross bar and was adjudged to have crossed the line during extra-time as England went on to lift the trophy 4-2.

The incident continues to leave a mark on German football where the term “Wembley-goal” is used to describe goal efforts which are difficult to validate.

In English, “Russian linesman” is a term sometimes used to describe controversial refereeing decisions after Azeri Tofik Bahkramov gave the green light to goal.

“I will die with the certitude that the ball didn’t cross the line,” Tilkowski said of the incident.

Hurst, who had been informed of Tilkowski’s death by the family, paid tribute to the former keeper as a ‘terrific player’ and ‘fine man.’ “Very sad to receive a call to let me know that Germany’s goalkeeper from 66 World Cup, Hans Tilkowski, has died,” Hurst tweeted. “Terrific player for his club, Dortmund, and country and a very fine man, I very much enjoyed the time we spent together over the years.”

Tilkpowski won the German Cup with Dortmund in 1965 before clinching the European Cup Winners’ Cup a year later.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/periio/article30496580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH07HANS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/germany-world-cupper-tilkowski-passes-away/article30496581.ece
417,2020/01/06,Kickstart not to compete in Second Division League,"Kickstart FC will not be competing in the upcoming Hero Second Division League 2019-20.

The city club had been nominated, alongside FC Bengaluru United, by the KSFA to take part in the competition. The nominations were subsequently approved by the AIFF League Committee, with the Second Division club licensing process scheduled to follow.

However, it is understood that Kickstart regarded the various club licensing criteria as being very challenging and thus decided against taking part in the process.

Confirming the development, Kickstart CEO Shekar Rajan stated that the club’s current priority was to invest in infrastructure.

“We are pushing a lot of money into our own facility. We have our own training grounds and we are now setting up a residential academy. Next year, we’ll be in a better position to meet the club licensing criteria and take part in the Second Division League,” he said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/kickstart-not-to-compete-in-second-division-league/article30495684.ece
418,2020/01/06,Shobana Ravi’s debut novel deals with the theft of antiques,"The first floor of the Odyssey Bookstore was packed last weekend, for the launch of The Auspicious, Shobana Ravi’s debut novel. The author is a popular Tamil news reader/presenter, who stole the hearts of millions with her voice and stylised manner of news reading for 30 years at the Doordarshan Kendra, Chennai.

The novel was launched by K K. Pandiarajan, Minister for Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture and, the first copy was received by noted film director Gautham Vasudev Menon.

The plot revolves around an idol mafia that has taken posession of certain antiques, and the action that unfolds in getting them back, shuttling from South India to Kashmir and Uttarakhand. The Minister said that he found the book riveting: “In this action packed narrative, Shobana has woven a world where many incredible incidents take place.”

The novel, according to him, has a good dose of romance, action, adventure and is highly relevant, given the current developments in the world of idol theft. “The intrigues related to idol theft and the complexities surrounding it has been comprehensively explained.”

“Abduction, violence, romance… all aspects Shobana has dealt in her novel seem to align with my vision of a film, and I wouldn’t hesitate to adapt a plot from her novel,” said Gautham. He said he sees a range of emotions in her work and is impressed by the narration, which is what he believes makes women better writers.

Nonagenarian BS Raghavan, a retired IAS officer, who spoke on the occasion, said that the daring nature of the author is reflected in the complex theme she has chosen for for novel.

“My career as news reader lasted for 30 years (1975 to 2006) and then I took voluntary retirement. After this I had a lot of time to pursue my various passions such as fitness (yoga and tai chi), writing poems, and singing (Carnatic),” said Shobana.

The author recalled how it was only after after penning down the first 10,000 words of the story that she took the book seriously. “I just went with the flow, I created the characters and they behaved in a manner they were supposed to. My experience in life, my point of view influenced the narration and I did research as and when it was required. In fact, I would only know at a time what my next two chapters would be, and take up research just for that.”

Shobana completed the work in January 2018, but feels that whatever she has written in her novel has become more realistic today, as “some of the themes dealt with in the book have taken centre-stage now,” she says.

The Auspicious, published by Blue Ocean Books (₹299), is available at Odyssey Bookstore and on Amazon.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/tquvdt/article30494322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/books/shobana-ravis-debut-novel-is-a-thriller-around-the-theme-of-idol-theft/article30494323.ece
419,2020/01/06,The book ‘Cricket Country’ is the story of the first Indian cricket team,"Did you know it took 12 years to create the first Indian cricket team? Six Parsis, five Hindus, three Muslims and a Sikh captain in the team were chosen on religious lines, consciously meant to represent various communities. The team’s first tour to Britain in 1911 had Palwankar brothers — Palwankar Balu and Shivram — dalits playing together. Captain Maharaja Bhupender Singh was just 19 and had become the ruler of Patiala! Packed with many such fascinating anecdotes, the book Cricket Country by Prashant Kidambi is a story of the first Indian cricket team.

Being a historian, Hyderabad-based Prashant did extensive research to make sure Cricket Country (₹ 699; published in June, 2019 by Penguin India and in UK by Oxford University Press) is not told as a sports history but of modern India. He works at the University of Leicester in the UK Explaining how the book, his second, evolved, he says, “The book looks at how sports is closely connected with questions of identity representations and how itis shaped by politics — an issue that became my concern as a historian. Cricket Country connects themes important to history, particularly Asian history and a popular subject (cricket). Although the theme is significant and scholarly, I tried to write in a way that it appeals to everyone.”

Cricket is central to India’s identity and followed with immense passion. The eleven players from different regions and speaking different languages are united by their love for the game. “We think of this as a representation of India and the book tries to show where the connection between nation and sport originated,” he says adding it was fascinating to see what Indians made of cricket which came to India because of British.

Parsis were the first to take to cricket and send teams to Britain. “Cricket becomes an import sense of community identity. I write about Muslims for whom cricket becomes an important way of rethinking their relationship with the British empire.” If the book’s first part dwells on how the team came together, the second part highlights their tour during an ‘extraordinary summer.’ He says, “1911 turned out to a hottest summer in English history. The temperature was soaring and Indians couldn’t bear the heat.” The team travels in the backdrop of tough conditions — working class unrest, House of Lords in crisis, political establishment at loggerheads, women fighting for their rights and Irish issues — and play in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. “It was the home of empire but also a home which was crumbling.”

The batsmen struggle initially with unfamiliar conditions but bounce back as the tour continues. The two dalit brothers — Balu and Shivram become heroes as a successful bowler and batsman. In the 23 matches they play, the Indian team wins six. It was also the time of Swadeshi movement and the tour had sporting and political significance too. “Most educated Indians believed the only way to get rid of British is not through the politics based on petitions but by using bomb and gun. Others wanted to use cricket tour to show the British that if they play cricket, they cannot be opposed to them,” he says adding, “What we see today in sport is not nationalism but hyper nationalism and the team is meant to carry a load on behalf of the nation.”

The book is based on Prashant’s 10-year-work (seven years of research and three years of writing). From archival sources in UK and India to newspapers, government records (to tell the Patiala story), he also looked at the histories of Hindu, Parsi and Muslim cricket and diaries. “I wanted to write a book not just for sports lovers but those who like reading a serious work of history; It is not about cricket history but with cricket as the theme and there is a distinction between them.”

Prashant didn’t want to tell a story in a linear way so the narrative is put across in different ways. This was also an exercise in time travel so he had to construct a picture for readers to feel connected. The challenges were many — finding the sources (“They were scattered”), taking notes by hand ( “Digitisation started in a big way only later”) too much material and deciding what is relevant. “I found many characters in this book for whom I couldn’t do justice. Writing is my profession and I will continue doing it.”",books,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/gwung7/article30492974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym06prashant,https://www.thehindu.com/books/cricket-country-is-a-serious-work-of-history-with-cricket-in-focus-says-historian-prashant-kidambi/article30492978.ece
420,2020/01/06,These communities call Chennai 'home',"“Human beings love stories because stories give you an immediate emotional connect to people,” says Anuradha Uberoi, author of recently-published Chennai Brew . The book is a compilation of personal stories told by individuals from different communities — Parsis, Sindhis, Bengalis, and Punjabis — who made Chennai their home. Anuradha says, “For me, the stories show how many communities live, prosper, survive, here, and are connected to Chennai.”

Some migrated to Madras during pressing times. “People witnessed violence of mammoth proportions during Partition. Many saw death at close quarters. They survived due to sheer luck or sheer bravery,” says Anuradha. The book has documents from such times... “There’s a document from Punjab Association asking people to come forward and claim property that was left behind. There was compensation for that. There is also a bank receipt for Rs. 8,000, that belongs to a gentleman named Ravi Malhotra, whose father received it for a property he left behind in Pakistan.”

Some were born around the time the city earned the sobriquet Detroit of Asia. Their forefathers had moved here seeking better work opportunities. Anuradha herself, who is originally from Chandigarh, moved to Chennai with her family in 1987 on work. But all of them came to the city with no thoughts of looking back.

The book acts like a tool to help one understand different communities through stories of individual lives. Anuradha has written about people from different walks of life: a school teacher, a CEO, an entrepreneur... Some stories reinstate traits attached to certain communities while others break stereotypes.

A community, Anuradha says, “Represents a group of people who belong to a similar demographic profile and who bond over familiar social customs, rituals and language.” She adds, “They are easily recognisable as they have many common social traits and beliefs.” Anuradha hopes that her book will help us understand each other better. “Perhaps some prejudices we have against certain communities will melt away,” she says.

Chennai Brew transports readers to another place and time with its interesting accounts. For instance, the Government declared book-keeping with the Sindhi accounting language Hatvanka illegal in the late 1960s. The number of Sindhis who know the language has dwindled over the years. “Those who know it don’t want to be associated with it because it was primarily designed to hoodwink the income tax authorities,” she says, and recalls how she met one Behari K Bajaj who, despite being unwell, wrote the alphabets and digits in the language on a piece of paper for her.

Anuradha says about her move to the city: “To say that Madras came as a culture shock to me is an understatement. The language handicap and the differing norms of socialising, food and entertainment posed barriers for me” But, over a period of time, she came to love it. “Today, I’m more comfortable here than in the North. When I hear Tamil in the streets of New York when travelling, for instance, I feel as elated as I would when I hear Hindi,” she says.

Anuradha’s quest for cultural understanding and integration doesn’t end with the book. “I take pains to educate my friends and relatives in North India about the rich culture of Chennai and the vast South Indian cuisine. I enjoy busting their myths about the city I’ve grown to love.”",books,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/w4cqyn/article30489509.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06mpChennaibrewG6C6UHTE93jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/chennai-brew-tells-stories-of-people-from-other-parts-of-india-who-found-warmth-and-love-in-the-city/article30491202.ece
421,2020/01/06,Dakar Rally | Goncalves does well to stay 14th overall,"Amidst tough riding conditions, including rocky terrain and heavy dust, Paulo Goncalves of Portugal held his own to finish 12th in Stage 2 and 14th overall at the Dakar Rally here on Monday.

Goncalves led the Hero MotoSports Team even as his other colleagues — Sebastian Buhler and C.S. Santosh — found the going equally and extremely difficult to finish in 21st and 53rd respectively.

The second stage took the competitors from Al Wajh to Neom for a special stage of 367Km.

Goncalves rode steadily with the sole objective of getting his bike to finish stage 2 without any damages either to vehicle or to himself.

Add to the rough terrain, the super marathon stage brought with it its own difficulties. That stage meant that Goncalves got only 10 minutes to work on his bike.

Buhler, too, did relatively well — he improved his position from 31st the other day — fighting through dust and rocky sections to finish 25th overall. Joaquim Rodrigues ended up 48th but his overall results will not be counted under wild card regulations.

Goncalves said all he wanted was to complete the race. “...I arrived without any issue with the bike so we are in a good shape to finish the second part of the super marathon on Tuesday. I will try to increase my pace day by day without making mistakes to get the team to a good finish.”

Santosh, who suffered a wrist injury on Sunday, rode reasonably well with persistent pain to end the race. “It was a really difficult day for me with all the pain in my wrist from Sunday’s crash. The stage was really rocky and all the impact was coming onto my hand making it really difficult to hold the bike,” he said.

Meanwhile, Sherco TVS’s Harith Noah finished in 51st position.

In Stage 3 on Tuesday, the rally will do one more loop around the city of Neom covering 404 km as part of special stage including the highest section of Dakar at an altitude of 1400m.

The results (Provisional placings): Stage 2: Hero Motorsports Team Rally: 12. Paulo Goncalves; 21. Sebastian Buhler; 53. C.S. Santosh.

Overall provisional rankings after Stage 2: 1. Sam Sunderland (Red Bull KTM Racing) 07h: 05m.22s; 2,. Pablo Quintanilla (Rockstar Energy Husqvarna) +01m 18s; 3. Kevin Benavides (Monster Energy Honda) +01m 32s; Hero Motorsports: 14. Goncalves; 25. Buhler; 48. Santosh.
