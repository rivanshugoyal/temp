1,2020/01/19,BU to issue access cards to hostel residents,"Several people claiming to be students are allegedly occupying the hostels of Bangalore University (BU). Apart from accommodation, these students also get food at the canteen at subsidised rates.

To put an end to this, authorities have decided to issue access cards to students, which they will have to swipe to enter the hostels.

In total, there are 1,968 students in seven hostels in the Jnanabharathi campus. According to estimates by university officials, at least 20% of them are not students of the university and have either completed their courses or were never enrolled in one. While 1,785 students reside in six hostels for boys, 183 students reside in one hostel for girls.

The university took the decision following an intense fight between two groups at the birthday party of a post-graduate student last week. An FIR was filed by a student who alleged verbal and physical harassment, and eight persons were detained. This triggered a protest by students urging the varsity to take action.

A source in the university said that even the wardens are unable to put an end to these practice as the student groups create tension when the issue is raised.

“Many of those who are overstaying are research scholars who are extremely popular, and instigate fights in the hostels. So we have to put an end to this. Many poor and meritorious students are not able to get accommodation in the hostels as they are fully occupied. We need to ensure that they are given preference,” said a senior official of the university.

However, students are sceptical of the move. “The university in the past too has attempted to issue access cards but failed to implement this step. In fact, many of those staying are in close proximity to some professors, who help them,” alleged Gururaj Desai, State secretary of the Students Federation of India.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bu-to-issue-access-cards-to-hostel-residents/article30601882.ece
2,2020/01/19,Citizens oppose CMP prepared by BMRCL,"The proposed Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) prepared by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has attracted the ire of citizens and activists, who have alleged that the CMP is a ‘back-door entry for the elevated corridor project’, which was put in the back-burner following strong opposition from the public.

The CMP mentions “92 km of arterial roads for elevated road designed with prioritising movement of public transport vehicles, regulation on private vehicles and facilitation of inter-modal mobility.”

It further says, “The north-south corridor and the central ring corridor of the elevated roads require a more rigorous study to confirm the feasibility with reference to alternate modes, including metrolite (elevated) and impact on the traffic flow.”

Monday (January 20) is the last date for citizens to send their feedback on the CMP.

Questioning the legality of the BMRCL preparing the CMP, Srinivasa Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB) said that BMRCL is not authorised to create a city-wide mobility plan. “Why is the BMRCL talking about the elevated corridor? It is a corporation dedicated to building and maintaining the metro. No one knows why and how they created a plan for the whole city,” he said.

Another citizen activist told The Hindu that a Unified Metropolitan Transit Strategy was the need of the hour. “A Unified Metropolitan Transit Authority should be established and be given the power and responsibility to create a combined mobility plan,” the activist said.

Citizens can send their feedback and objections to cmpcomments@bmrc.co.in",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/citizens-oppose-cmp-prepared-by-bmrcl/article30601784.ece
3,2020/01/19,Residents left homeless as over 100 makeshift houses razed in Bellandur,"Residents of around 150 makeshift houses were left homeless after an eviction drive in Bellandur and Kariyammana Agrahara on Sunday. Hundreds of people, including children, were on the streets along with their belongings. Young children were seen holding their belongings, clueless about where to go next. Those who lost their homes are working in the city as security guards, domestic help, construction workers and in the solid waste management sector.

Though all the agencies involved in the drive refused to take ownership of the same, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), in a letter to the police to seek security during the drive, alleged that Bangladeshi nationals had illegally occupied the area.

The Assistant Executive Engineer of the BBMP’s Marathahalli sub-division, on Saturday, had written to Marathahalli police station seeking police protection to carry out the drive. In the letter, the official stated that in Bellandur ward, “Bangladeshi nationals have built illegal sheds and converted the area into a slum.” The letter also states that the BBMP has received oral complaints about the illegal settlement.

‘We are Indians’

The evicted occupants, on the other hand, have dismissed the charges and maintained that they are Indians from West Bengal and Assam, among other States. Over 500 families are said to be living in the area.

“The police appeared in civil dress and accused us of being Bangladeshis without investigating our documents. I tried to convince them and not to bring down any house. Instead of listening to our pleas, they abused us,” alleged Uttam Kumar Das, who works as a security guard at a tech park. “If we are poor, it doesn’t mean we do not have any rights,” he added.

Residents in the area alleged that their houses were demolished without giving prior notice. Residents said that authorities carried out the drive on Saturday and Sunday.

Ishtiyak Ahmed, who works a security guard at a tech park, said, “We live here with our children and family. It is impossible to shift within the span of two days. The government should know that living in Bengaluru is not easy for poor people like us. We are Indians. Where else do we have to go?”

Mahima Nandni, a 34-year-old mother of two daughters, was distraught. “We neither have money nor a place to stay. The whole night, we slept under a four-wheeler rickshaw. My husband is out of town, and I do not know what to do,” she said.

The slum-dwellers also alleged that power and water supply to the area were cut off a week ago.

Some children were seen crying. Whoever was at the spot took care of those children whose parents were not present.

Afshana, a 7-year-old girl, said, “I was at home after returning from school when they demolished our house. My father is no more and my mother was away at work.”

The evicted residents said they have all the required documents.

“We are not illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. We have all the required IDs to prove we are from West Bengal and other States in the north east. We are ready to submit the documents to the authorities concerned. The police, along with the officials, have razed our houses and warned us to vacate the premises within two hours. We have been living here with our families for many years. Now the police are forcing us to vacate the houses within two hours. Where should we go? Is this not illegal?"" said Abdul Jabbar, a resident.

BBMP washes hands off drive

As occupants of over 100 houses were left without shelter, both the BBMP and the police washed their hands off the drive.

Paramesh, chief engineer of Mahadevapura zone, said, “The BBMP has no role in the drive. It was carried out by the police. In the past too, such drives were carried out. We have been receiving complaints from local residents about illegal occupants. Littering and open defecation are causing a lot of problems to other residents. There are law and order issues as well.”

When asked about the letter written to the police by a local BBMP official, he said, “Before writing the letter, he should have brought the issue to the notice of higher-ups, which he has not.”

Police points to BBMP

The Whitefield police, on the other hand, said they provided security cover for the eviction process carried out by the BBMP.

According to the police, the authorities concerned had issued notices three months ago to the landlords to provide the IDs of their tenants, but failed to get a response.

“Moreover, they were occupying government land, which the BBMP is recovering,” a police officer said.

The police added that owners of the private land will be booked for not following the directives issued by the authorities concerned.

In October, the Central Crime Branch (CCB) of the police had detained 60 people alleged to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The drives were carried out in Ramamurthynagar, Bellandur, and Marathahalli police station limits.

4,2020/01/19,‘Lord Ganesha’ distributes free helmets in Bengaluru,"It was divine intervention for erring motorists who had chosen not to wear helmets. The traffic police engaged the services of ‘Ganesha’ to gift helmets to motorists caught violating traffic rules in and around Bhashyam Circle instead of slapping fines.

This initiative by the Rajajinagar traffic police was a part of the 31st Road Safety Week with an aim to create awareness among motorists.

The drive saw the police resorting to ‘Gandhigiri’ by gifting helmets to motorists caught riding without one, along with chocolates and roses. This was followed by a request with folded hands to follow traffic rules for the safety of everyone.

The man posing as Lord Ganesha joked to violators that they would not be as lucky as him to get a ‘head replacement’ in case of an accident.

""You should realise that you have a family that is waiting for your safe return. At least for their sake, you should follow traffic rules and wear a helmet,” M.A. Mahesh, Traffic Inspector, Rajajinagar told violators. As it was an awareness campaign, the violators were let off with a stern warning and a promise from them to follow traffic rules.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/smak4d/article30601265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGGANESHASAYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/lord-ganesha-distributes-free-helmets/article30601266.ece
5,2020/01/19,Residents catch truck dumping chemical waste into Vrishabhavati river,"Alert residents of a gated community caught a truck driver trying to dump chemical waste into the Vrishabhavathi river on Saturday night.

The truck was seized and the keys were taken away by the residents. But, when the residents, accompanied by the beat police, went to the police station to file a complaint, the driver vanished along with the truck.

Nagaraju, Ramaraju, M.K. Kulkarni, C.J. Prakash, all residents of GoodEarth Orchard, noticed the truck belonging to a factory trying to dump the waste and caught hold of the driver. But he managed to escape.

The residents immediately called up the police control room.

The residents alleged that though the matter was reported around 9.15 p.m., the night beat policemen reached the spot around 10.40 p.m., that too after repeated follow-ups.

Meanwhile, the residents took samples of the chemical from the truck, and also took photographs. The night beat police suggested that the residents go to the police station to file a formal complaint. The residents took the keys of the truck before heading to the police station. After filing a complaint when they returned to the spot, the truck was missing.

“We suspect some nexus between the authorities concerned and the factory owners who are dumping waste unscientifically,” a resident said.

""This is not the first time. We have complained several times to the police and the BBMP about waste and chemicals being dumped in the river, causing health hazard to the residents in and around, but in vain,” another resident said.

“It is a disappointing as the police commissioner, on one hand, claims to have reduced the response time of the beat police. But in reality, the police are slower and inactive,” another resident rued.

Kengeri Inspector Vijay Kumar told The Hindu that necessary action would be taken against the accused. “We have obtained details of the truck and efforts are on to track down the driver,” he added.

On January 4, The Hindu had reported about plastic being segregated and burnt along the river bed. Residents from a gated community in Kambipura had complained to the panchayat and the police about the menace. The vacant land on which this was going on has been cleared now, residents said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/1pm6gv/article30601099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGPLASTICFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/residents-catch-truck-dumping-chemical-waste-into-vrishabhavati-river/article30601100.ece

7,2020/01/19,BBMP Standing Committee polls held; members elected unopposed,"Elections to the 12 Standing Committees of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) were finally held on Saturday, amidst discontent, tears and compromise. The members of all committees were elected unopposed.

The councillors were given time between 8 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. to file nominations for the various committees. Five committees – Town Planning, Public Works, Education, Social Justice and Markets – received 11 nominations while seven others received more than 11.

However, the ruling BJP leadership tried to convince some councillors to withdraw their nominations. The elections were scheduled at 11.30 a.m. But with the negotiations taking time, the elections were held at 12.40 p.m.

The election proceedings were conducted by Regional Commissioner V.N. Prasad. Though time was given for withdrawal of nominations, a few councillors were unwilling to do so, but had to eventually toe the party line.

Some councillors, including Mahalakshmi (Hosahalli), Netra Pallavi (Atturu) and Ramesh (Marathahalli), were unable to control their tears, having lost the chance to become chairpersons of some panels.

While 11 members each have been elected to 11 of the 12 committees, only 10 have been elected to the Standing Committee for Accounts.

The committee had received 12 nominations from councillors. Later, two councillors – V. Shivaprakash (Okalipuram) and Shantha Babu (Singasandra) – withdrew their nominations.

This caused traffic snarls along the route.

However, the traffic police said that the inconvenience caused was minimal as it was during non-peak hours and it was a weekend.

Mr. Shah arrived at HAL Airport in east Bengaluru around 12.30 p.m. and participated at an event in Palace Grounds, later went to south Bengaluru, and returned to HAL airport to leave for Hubballi.

This affected the traffic in the Central Business District as the Home Minister passed through the region multiple times.

There was traffic pile-up on J.C. Road, Majestic, N.R. Square, and Mysuru Road. Mr. Shah also participated in two events in Jayanagar and Basavanagudi, disrupting traffic flow.

The police also stopped traffic in these areas, especially near Vidyapeetha Circle, leading to a pile-up that took over an hour to clear.

10,2020/01/19,A mega quantum technology mission is in the offing,"India is set to enter the hotly pursued domain of quantum technologies in a big way with a new National Mission on Quantum Technologies, according to a senior official of the Department of Science and Technology.

This area is significant to satellites, military and cyber security among others as it promises unimaginably fast computing and safe, unhackable satellite communication to its users.

Worldwide, governments, information technology giants and scientists have made this their thrust area and have invested big money and efforts into it, said K.R. Murali Mohan, Head of DST’s Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems, New Delhi, in a recorded speech at an international scientific gathering at the Raman Research Institute here on Saturday.

Quantum technologies, he said, are strategically important and the inter-ministerial mission would involve ‘sensitive’ departments. China, the US and a few European countries are in the lead and India wants to join the scene in an era of highly damaging cyber attacks.

“The Government of India is also very much committed to developing these technologies. It is contemplating a National Mission on Quantum Technologies [by providing] huge investments through DST,” he said, inviting Indian scientists to provide insights to a detailed project report that is being prepared.

About 18 months back, the government initiated serious discussions in quantum technologies and kick started research projects across 51 organisations under QUEST – Quantum Enabled Science and Technology.

‘Not just research’

Dr. Murali Mohan said, “The NMQT will be a bigger mission than that with huge investments and widespread applications. We are in the stage of developing a DPR and [issuing] a memo on expenditure, finance and funding.” QT, he said, would not be just about research but aim to translate it into products and useful technologies.

The six-day meeting on ‘Quantum frontiers and fundamentals’ was hosted by the RRI’s Quantum lab, whose head Urbasi Sinha is leading highend work in quantum communication.

One of the world’s leading QT exponents, Jian-Wei Pan of the University of Science and Technology of China, told this newspaper that companies such as Google, Microsoft, Intel and IBM are intensely working on a ‘quantum computer’ that can crunch big data with ease: such a computer can crack 300-digit problems in seconds – while it would take today’s computers several thousand years to figure it out.

Other possibilities, he said, are precise time, position and magnetic field that will allow us to navigate without the GPS one day. “In future, this emerging area of QT can change information science as also our lives,” beyond what we can imagine now, he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/a-mega-quantum-technology-mission-is-in-the-offing/article30598715.ece

12,2020/01/19,"Coronavirus: Wenlock, RGICD hospitals identified as nodal centres","Following a travel advisory issued by the Union government cautioning Indians travelling to China to follow public health measures to avoid the novel coronavirus, the State Health Department has identified two government hospitals as nodal centres for treatment of suspected or confirmed cases.

The Centre’s advisory was issued following an outbreak of novel coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. As on January 11, the virus infected 59 persons and killed one in China. One patient each who travelled to China and got infected have been found in Thailand and Japan.

B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), told The Hindu that although no case has been reported in India, the State had geared up to tackle spread of the virus.

“We have conducted an orientation for all district surveillance officials on Friday and have identified the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) in Bengaluru and Wenlock hospital in Mangaluru as nodal centres. We are coordinating with the airport health officials,” he said.

“In case of symptoms suggestive to respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are advised to seek medical attention provider,” he said.

Follow etiquettes

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued a travel advisory to observe good personal hygiene, practise frequent hand washing with soap, covering the mouth when coughing or sneezing. People have been advised to avoid close contact with those who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness, such as cough, runny nose. Contact with live animals and consumption of raw or under-cooked meats, travel to farms, live animal markets or where animals are slaughtered should be avoided, the advisory said.

The ministry has said that clinical signs and symptoms are mainly fever with a few patients having difficulty in breathing. However, the mode of transmission is unclear as of now. “However, so far there is little evidence of significant human-to-human transmission,” the advisory added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/coronavirus-wenlock-rgicd-hospitals-identified-as-nodal-centres/article30596537.ece

18,2020/01/19,Four held near Bhopal for robbery,"The Elephant Gate police on Saturday arrested a four-member gang that robbed two employees of a Nellore-based jeweller of ₹1.70 crore worth gold bars, in the city last week.

Kamalesh, a jeweller in Nellore, supplies gold to various jewellers in Andhra Pradesh. He had sent his employee, Dinesh Kumar, 19, with a driver in a car to Chennai, to procure gold at Sowcarpet, the police said.

The duo was carrying back 4kg of gold bars, after buying them for ₹1.70 crore in cash, from a dealer on N.S.C. Bose Road. While they were returning in their vehicle, the gang waylaid them near Wall Tax Road, on the night of January 10. The suspects claimed to be from the Delhi Police and asked the duo to cooperate in a search of the vehicle. The gang searched the bag containing the gold bars, and returned it. Only after the gang left did Dinesh realise that gold bars were missing.

Crime Inspector Rani led the investigation. After scrutinising CCTV footage and records of mobile phones, the police obtained clues. The gang members had travelled to Goa by bus. From there, they were on their way to Bhopal by train. A special police team, with the help of the railway police, traced the gang and nabbed them on the moving train.

Later, they were brought to city.

19,2020/01/19,"This Kaanum Pongal, a dip in beach waste","The quantity of waste generated from city beaches reduced this Kaanum Pongal, with a significant reduction in plastic waste. When compared to around 50 tonnes collected after Kaanum Pongal in the previous years, the civic body and the private conservancy operator reportedly collected just around 16 tonnes of waste from the Marina, and 10 tonnes from Elliot’s beach.

Over 15.8 tonnes of municipal solid waste was collected from the Marina beach, on the night of Kaanum Pongal. “Over 120 conservancy workers cleaned the beach on the night of Kaanum Pongal. Plastic waste has reduced this year. Most waste collected this year was biodegradable. We collect around eight tonnes from the Marina every day. It increased by just around eight tonnes this Kaanum Pongal,” said an official.

Officials attributed the reduction in plastic waste to the successful implementation of the ban on plastics in the city. In addition to workers of the private conservancy operator, the Chennai Corporation had to deploy additional manpower on Kaanum Pongal day to clear the waste.

At Elliot’s beach in Besant Nagar, the civic body collected around 10 tonnes of waste the night of Kaanum Pongal. The city generated around 4,500 tonnes of municipal solid waste after Kaanum Pongal.

Many Corporation parks were illuminated on the occasion, attracting a number of people. “The waste generated in each park doubled this Kaanum Pongal, but plastic waste reduced significantly,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/this-kaanum-pongal-a-dip-in-beach-waste/article30597066.ece

“Passengers arriving [from China] with symptoms such as fever, cough and cold are being screened at airports. The State government will continue necessary surveillance and preventive measures to contain the spread of the virus, just as it did in the case of Nipah and Ebola. There is no need for panic,” Mr. Vijayabaskar said while speaking to reporters.

P. Jayaraman and J.Premalatha, the deceased’s father and sister, moved a petition for compensation.

According to their petition, on April 25, 2012 while Vijayaraghavan was riding a motorcycle on the Medavakkam-Perumbakkam main road, a lorry hit his vehicle from behind.

Vijayaraghavan fell and sustained fatal injuries.

S. Ramesh, the owner of the lorry, L & T General Insurance Company Limited (now merged with HDFC-ERGO General Insurance) were named as respondents.

Negligent act

Based on a copy of the FIR, medical records and eyewitnesses, the tribunal noted that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the lorry driver and the insurance firm was liable to pay compensation.

Vijayaraghavan’s wife Parameswari was named as the third respondent.

According to court proceedings, he had filed a divorce petition. However, since he passed away during the pendency of the petition, it was not granted.

Since divorce was not granted to the deceased, Parameswari was treated as wife of Vijayaraghavan and she was entitled to the compensation, the tribunal said.

The father and wife are entitled to loss of dependency and loss of estate-related compensation, while his sister was entitled only to the loss of love aspect of compensation, it added.

23,2020/01/19,Prices of some vegetables dip at Koyambedu market,"Prices of some staple vegetables have begun to fall at the Koyambedu wholesale market on account of higher arrivals and lower demand during the holiday season.

On Saturday, a measure of normalcy began to return to the market. During the Pongal holidays, the wholesale market received only 50-60% of the daily average in terms of arrivals, said traders.

Onions, that touched a record high, are now priced between ₹45 and ₹60 a kg at the market. Small onions cost up to ₹110 a kg, depending on quality. The market has received 50 truckloads of onions daily, due to good yield, from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, the traders said.

Though most vegetables have become affordable, sales have been dull, and only 50% of the produce got sold. Overall, there was a 20% drop in sales compared to Pongal last year, said S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Wholesale Market Licensed Merchants’ Association.

Ladies’ finger, chayote (chow chow in Tamil) and green chillies were some of the cheap vegetables, priced below ₹10 a kg, at the wholesale market. “We expect sales to pick up from Monday, after the holiday season,” he said.

According to some traders, several vegetables are now priced upto ₹40 a kg. Beans and broad beans, that are usually costly, are priced at ₹35-40 a kg. Drumsticks remain the costliest, selling for ₹130-170 a kg, depending on quality.

P. Sukumar, treasurer of the association, said prices had decreased by 20% in the past few days. “Vegetables such as cucumber, cabbage and radish, that have high water content, have less demand during winter, and are priced below ₹15 a kg,” he said.

The cost of vegetables such as carrots, drumsticks and onions will dip further in a fortnight, after fresh arrivals hit the market.

25,2020/01/19,AIADMK cadre caught on camera abusing ACP,"A video of two AIADMK functionaries abusing a senior police officer, on Marina beach, went viral on social media and mobile messaging platforms. While no complaint has been registered yet, senior police officers said they were enquiring into the incident.

The city police made elaborate bandobust arrangements on Kamarajar Salai and the Marina on Friday.

Two AIADMK functionaries, who came in a jeep, attempted to enter the Loop Road, where parking was prohibitied. An Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), deployed for special bandobust duty, objected and prevented the entry of the vehicle.

The functionaries, who were reportedly drunk, got down from the vehicle, and had a heated argument with the ACP. Though the officer was stubborn in asking them to move away from the place, other police personnel were seen pacifying them. The ACP was abused by the duo when he said that he would arrest them. He then alerted the control room.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/49g5mq/article30597053.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Screenshot20200118220321,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/aiadmk-cadre-caught-on-camera-abusing-acp/article30597054.ece
26,2020/01/19,"Duo held for seeking bribes from accused, posing as CBI officers","The Central Bureau of Investigation on Saturday arrested two suspects for demanding huge bribes purportedly on behalf of, and in the name of, CBI officers from persons accused of involvement in cases of bank fraud.

The duo had made multiple calls to the complainants, posing as senior investigators and making it seem as if they were calling from the landline number of the CBI headquarters.

The agency registered a case on Wednesday based on a specific input that the suspects, Selvam Ramaraj of Madurai and Y. Manivardhan Reddy of Hyderabad, along with a few others, had been threatening different individuals facing cases with central law enforcement agencies. In one instance, they contacted an accused in a bank fraud case registered by the CBI and demanded a huge amount of money in the name of senior officials.

Malicious software

They used a malicious software to duplicate the landline telephone number (011-24302700) of the CBI, installed at its head office in New Delhi, and made several calls to the accused, claiming to be senior CBI officers from New Delhi.

They demanded bribes for getting them favours in the case. The suspects made similar calls to accused involved in other criminal cases booked by central agencies.

On January 4, 2020, Manivardhan Reddy even travelled to Guntur (Andhra Pradesh) and met an accused in a CBI case and demanded money in the name of senior investigators. He threatened the accused with dire consequences if the money was not paid in two days.

The CBI registered a case against the suspects on charges of Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating) read with the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. It also booked the duo under the Information Technology Act, 2000.

Special teams conducted simultaneous searches on their premises in Chennai, Madurai, Sivakasi and Hyderabad, leading to the seizure of several mobile phones, incriminating WhatsApp communication and documents relating to the allegations.

‘Lot of money’

Asked if the duo received any money from victims (accused in CBI cases), a CBI official said there was information that they had received a lot of money taking the names of senior officers. “We are going into the details of this information. Enquiries will made with every individual with whom the two contacted or sent messages,” the official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/duo-held-for-seeking-bribes-from-accused-posing-as-cbi-officers/article30597034.ece
27,2020/01/19,"Sindhu, Tai Tzu Ying star attractions as Premier Badminton League","At the launch of the season-5 of the Premier Badminton League here, endorsements came thick and fast from many players including World champions Carolina Marin and P. V. Sindhu. All players, including Sai Praneeth, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, Christinna Pedersen and Lakshya Sen gave a thumbs-up to PBL at the media conference.

When the PBL begins here on January 20 (Monday) — it returns to the city after two years — it promises to feature exciting matches. Two stars — Sindhu and World No.2 Tai Tzu Ying — will be in action on the first two days.

On the first day Chennai Superstarz will take on Hyderabad Hunters, which will most likely witness Sindhu in action.

And on the next day, Bengalur Raptors of which World No. 2 Tai Tzu Ying is a part, will take on North East Warriors.

For the 16-year-old upcoming player S. Sankar Muthusamy, it will be a learning curve watching top Indian and foreign players practice and play. “I am waiting to interact with International players,” he said.

Doubles specialist Satwiksairaj Rankireddy went up a step further. “Every year we wait for PBL. My game really developed there,” the 19-year-old said.

“To play [in PBL] in front of Indian fans has been great,” remarked Marin, in a video message.

She, however, will not be part of PBL this time.

Stars missing out

This being the Olympic year, a few top players have opted out, deciding instead to recuperate and prepare for the quadrennial event.

This time, K. Srikanth, Saina Nehwal, H.S. Prannoy and Sameer Verma are some of the prominent names who will be missing.

The 2020 edition will have 24 ties played in 21 days across three different cities starting on January 20 in Chennai (till Jan. 24), followed by Lucknow (Jan. 25 to 28) and Hyderabad (Jan. 29 to Feb. 6).

The semifinals (Feb. 7 & 8) and final (Feb. 9) will be held in Hyderabad.

Finding venues has been a problematic area for the organisers even though they would not like say it openly. Stadiums in many venues, reportedly charge “exorbitantly” from the organisers.

In fact, it has been reliably learnt that strings had to be pulled to get Chennai back as one of the venues for the current season.

Out of the opening lines of Sicilian Rossolimo, Anand looked clearly better but could not consolidate his position beyond a point. A worried Carlsen was banking on Anand to err in time-pressure but the veteran held on. Eventually, Carlsen found a way to draw.

Meanwhile, 16-year-old Iranian Alireza Firouzja continued to make the chess world sit up and take note of his exceptional showings.

He defeated USA’s Jeffery Xiong to regain sole lead at five points — half-a-point ahead of Fabiano Caruana, Wesley So and Jorden van Foreest.

The leader is 1.5 points ahead of Magnus Carlsen, Anand and four others.

In the Challengers’ Category, young Nihal Sarin (4) was the only winner of the day after conquering Dinara Saduakassova in 47 moves. Joint-second Surya Shekhar Ganguly (4.5) drew with Rauf Mamedov.

The 25-year-old Punia, staged a comeback to secure a 4-3 win against USA’s Jordan Michael Oliver in the summit showdown of the 65kg freestyle category on Saturday.

Dahiya, who competed in the 61kg category instead of his regular 57kg, bagged the gold after getting the better of Kazakhstan’s Nurbolat Abdualiyev 12-2 in his final bout on Saturday.

The 23-year-old from Sonepat had made it to the final round after securing impressive wins over Moldova’s Alexaandru Chirtoaca and Kazakhstan’s Nurislam Sanayev in the four-wrestler draw.

India, thus, returned with seven medals from the tournament.

Vinesh Phogat and Anhsu Malik won a gold and silver respectively in the women’s competition. In Greco-roman, Gurpreet Singh (82kg) won a gold, Sunil Kumar (97kg) a silver, while Sajan Bhanwal (77kg) settled for a bronze.

Punia admitted that he was not at his best. “Yes, the bouts were close. It’s just the first tournament of the season, so I was a bit rusty. I had a feeling going into this tournament and that the performance will be a bit up and down,” Punia told PTI.

“But having close bouts is not a worry, it’s good. It keeps me alert and gives me a chance to ponder over my shortcomings,” he said.

Punia’s personal coach Shako Bentinidis was not with him in Rome and that too affected the Indian wrestler.

Up against one of India’s biggest medal prospects in the Tokyo Olympics, Oliver conceded that it was not his night against Punia. The American lauded the competitive spirit of Punia.

Punia had to sweat it out in the first round against Zain Allen Retherford of USA before prevailing 5-4.

In the quarterfinal, the ace Indian wrestler went past another American Joseph Christopher Mc Kenna 4-2, before getting the better of Vasyl Shuptar of Ukraine 6-4 in the semi-finals.

However, it was curtains for Jitender in the 74kg and world championship silver medallist Deepak Punia in the 86kg category.

Jitender won his first bout against Denys Pavlov of Ukraine 10-1 before going down in the quarterfinals against Turkey’s Soner Demirtas 4-0.

Jitender got a change to fight in the repechage after Demirtas entered the final, but the Indian wasted the opportunity, losing 2-9 to Daniyar Kaisanov of Kazakhstan.

In the 86kg category, Deepak Punia crashed out in the opening round, losing 1-11 to Ethan Adrian Ramos of Puerto Rico.

“I am aiming for the 2024 Olympics. Hopefully, I will do well in the trials and book a place in the Indian swimming contingent for the Olympics,” said Mondal after bagging his second gold at the Khelo India Youth Games.

Although Mondal has to beat his competitors in the pool to win medals, the swimmer does not focus on his competitors and just ensures that he is putting up his best performance.

“I don’t look at any of my competitors when I am racing in the pool. I pace myself by looking at the wall. I just try and focus on my own performance,” said Mondal.

When asked about how he made his foray into swimming, the West Bengal swimmer said that he was always interested in swimming since his childhood.

“I was always interested in swimming since my childhood. So when my mother asked me to join an extra-curricular activity, I opted for swimming. So, then I started swimming,” said Mondal.

“Initially, I picked up the sport quickly, but as I moved to higher levels, I had to start working very hard.

32,2020/01/19,Badminton | Praneeth’s sights set on Tokyo,"In more ways than one, it has been a truly memorable year (2019) for Sai Praneeth. The 27-year-old was conferred the Arjuna Award and also went on to bag a historic World badminton championships bronze.

On the personal front, too, it was just as memorable, having tied the knot with Swetha Jayanthi last month.

“2019 was good news for me other than [just] badminton. I played consistently well. Reaching the Swiss Open final in March really changed things for me at the beginning of the year,” said Praneeth, at a media interaction here on Saturday, ahead of Premier Badminton League Season-5.

In good position

In the race against time by Indians to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics, Praneeth is in a relatively good position to make the cut — being ranked 11th in the world and 19th according to Olympic qualification rules (only those in the top 16 and two from a country can qualify).

“Four months still remain. Everyone is fighting for the spot. There is a very big competition. I want to confirm my berth as soon as possible,” said Praneeth.

He said World No. 1 Kento Momota would be the player to beat in Tokyo as he is physically and mentally much fitter than the rest, but felt the Japanese might not win at the Olympics.

“The one-year ban [in 2016] made him strong, and that helped him so much. He trained very hard [during the time]. But my sixth sense says Momota will lose in the Olympics, but we can never say for sure.

“Because he has won everything — the Super Series, the BWF Super 1000, 750 and 500 — there might be extra pressure on him at Tokyo,” he said.

Praneeth felt the BWF schedule had become hectic as players have to play a minimum of 12 tournaments in a calendar year.

“At some point, it becomes difficult. We can’t play that many tournaments but we have no choice. Unless the BWF makes a change, we can’t do anything about it,” he said.

33,2020/01/19,A mystery in the mountains,"It was one of those winter mornings in the Nilgiris when the day dawned bright and clear after a night of rain. The past few days we had been rather busy and I hadn’t been able to pay much attention to the garden. I stepped out to check all the pots and plants and lo and behold in the flower bed at the front of the house, there was a deep pit in the first row of the bright, yellow gazanias. It had been neatly scooped out with the roots, leaving a little crater right at the entrance to our home.

Immediately, I summoned the gardener and his wife. The cook, who knows a fair bit about plants, arrived as well and of course, no one owned up. Then the blame game started, and to make matters more confusing, there was a set of footprints just behind the little hole where the missing plant had been. It was a deep impression as it had rained the previous evening and the mud was still wet.

At the gardener’s suggestion, an exercise in matching the footprints followed. Everyone from the gardener, his wife and the cook had their footwear inspected. Now the mystery was deepening. A plant was missing and presumably the person to whom the footprints belonged was the culprit. Since it had rained most of the previous night, the theft should have taken place in the morning. Logically expanding this theory, the thief had to be someone who knew a good deal about plants.

This little mystery nagged me through the day. I made a mental list of all the suspects. The milkman was ruled out at the outset as nothing had ever gone missing in the more than 20 years that he has been delivering milk to our home. Next the newspaper delivery man was ruled out as he hardly ever came inside the gate. At this point, my list had three suspects: the gardener, his wife and the cook. All three had ample opportunity the previous day, as we had been out for the better half of the day.

By afternoon, I had a sudden flash of insight, “What about the delivery man from the florist who came to drop a bouquet of chrysanthemums for our tenants?” He came soon after 8 a.m. and his footprint had not been checked. In all probability, he would understand plants. Both motive and opportunity were there. As I followed this line of thought, I became fully convinced that the taker of our gazania plant had to be the delivery man from the florist. The only catch was our guard dog, about whose presence there were enough warnings near the entrance.

To get to the bottom of this, I called our tenant. Our gate is common, and that is how the flower delivery man came to our house, as they had already left home for the day. I asked him to check which florist their well wisher had used. He promised to look into it. Like in an Agatha Christie novel, I was matching motive and opportunity with all possible suspects. At that point, the flower delivery man was the prime suspect in my eyes.

After speaking to my mum, who happened to call post lunch, I was back to thinking that perhaps the gardener was suspect number one after all. But the presence of the footprints clouded the issue, and so the delivery man from the florist could not be ruled out as a suspect.

Finally after exploring all possible theories, I decided not to dwell further on this theft of African daisies and to leave it as an unsolved mystery. Later that evening, we went across to wish our tenants as it was their wedding anniversary. That was the reason for the prime suspect to enter our compound in

the morning. As we were discussing the morning’s mystery of the missing gazanias, our tenant showed me a picture taken on her phone at 8 a.m. of the little crater in our flower bed with the footprints at the back. Their curious little son was fascinated at the sight of the big hole in the flower bed, imagining the size of the wild boar that could have dug the hole. He had moved around in the flower bed so two small sets of footprints had joined to seem like one big footprint. The picture preceded the arrival of the flower delivery man.

After all my time spent on playing Poirot, it was their little son who had stood in the centre of the bed gazing at the hole where the clump of cheerful gazanias had been. So the unsolved mystery of the footprints was solved. As to who took the plant is a mystery to this day. And one that I am coming to think is better left unsolved.

34,2020/01/19,Zeroing in on your passion,"Are you struggling to figure out your passion?

Passion is your total involvement with life or an important aspect of life. It’s such a positive aspect of human experience which gives you deep joy and brings out your best creativity.

You often feel that you must follow your passion. But when you want to figure out what is your passion, you struggle and feel clueless. You are attracted to certain activities, but you are not sure if they are your passion.

Your passion could be in any domain. It could be even in a sub-domain of your profession. For example, a lawyer may be passionate about legal research. However, your passion may also be outside your professional domain. For example, a professor may be passionate about singing or playing golf. But how should you find out your deep love for something?

The first step to figure out passion is to understand how engaged do you feel about your existing interests? Do you have sufficient self-motivation to do it or someone has to push you into it? For example, do you get up early in the morning on your own and go to the gym or you need a strong nudge from your jogging group?

Do you feel guilty? Another sign of your passion is how much do you miss an activity when you don’t do it for a few days or weeks? If you miss it for a few days or weeks, do you feel guilty about it? Having guilt is a clear signal of passion. For example, when I travel for more than a week, I start feeling guilty about missing my gym. It’s a clear signal that I am passionate about my physical fitness regimen.

Your passion may exist in a new activity also. So ask yourself, “Is there any activity, game, sports, enterprise or profession that attracts me but I haven’t yet tried?” Therefore, try whatever attracts you and observe how you feel about the new experience. Another relevant question would be, “Is it too time consuming and challenging or it is so enjoyable that I don’t mind the time and challenge?” Also, ask yourself, “Would I want to repeat the experience?”

Does time stop for you and feel absorbed?

Another important sign of your passion for an activity is that you get completely absorbed in it. You forget the environment and also ignore the sense of time. Famous psychologist and author Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls this experience “flow”. When you are in flow, your self-consciousness vanishes and you lose sense of time. You are willing to do such activities for their own sake without worrying for any extrinsic reward or even when they are difficult or dangerous — for example, scuba diving and bungee jumping.

Your passion may ignite at any opportune time in your life. My wife had no idea that she had a deep passion for gardening, plants and flowers. But when we moved to a new city, she had ample time at her hand which she started devoting to gardening. It wasn’t absolutely enjoyable in the beginning. It was a

mixed bag. But with time, she got completely absorbed into it and found her passion.

But keep it in mind that in the beginning, no pursuit is going to be as engaging and attractive as you dreamed it to be. For example, if golf attracts you and you initiate the learning of the golf, learning in the first few months is going to be hard. It wouldn’t give the joy you had thought it would provide. At this stage, your challenge of hitting the ball properly would be high and your skills of hitting the ball would be low. This is the stage of struggle. You would need to practise hard, train your eyes to focus on the small ball, balance your body and hit the ball in a rhythmic way. This synchronisation comes slowly after patient practice. Thus, when your skill is low and challenge is high, you will struggle. You would not enjoy the optimal experience in the golf.

Ask yourself, “Am I really interested in this game?”

At this stage, the key to success is ask yourself, “Can I upscale my skills?” If your answer is yes, then stay put in the game. After some practice, you would start hitting the ball properly and you would start enjoying it. Here, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi says that you would enjoy the optimal experience and feel passionate about the game of golf.

But you should not be self-conscious and should leave everything at rest for some time. If you are constantly thinking about how others are perceiving you, you would not enjoy the game. Similarly, if you are too self-centred, and evaluate everything in terms of its utility, you won’t be interested in meeting interesting people and engaging in enjoyable activities. You won’t lose yourself to an intrinsic activity which gives no rewards but just the activity itself.

Feedback and advice may help you in knowing if you have the potential to thrive in an activity. It may help you push further into an engagement which later may become your real passion.

Does your passion match with your character strengths?

It’s easy to achieve success in an activity if it matches with your high character strengths. For example, if you are high on love of learning and curiosity, you can easily get absorbed in academia and research. But if you are strong on love, humility, social intelligence and kindness, you may do very well in guest, personal and business relationships. It’s easier to get passionate about an activity if it matches with your higher level character strengths.

So to figure out your passion, observe and think deeply about your existing interests, keep your eyes open for any option in life, find out your guilt and try new activities that attract you. At the same time, you should observe in which activity the time stops for you, when your consciousness expands, what your friends advise you about your engagements and what matches with your character strengths. And you would easily find out your passion and get really passionate about it.

35,2020/01/19,Breaking the beauty stereotypes,"I love listening to old tales of my parents about their childhood and youth; it takes me down a nostalgic lane of memories I never had, but yet I can see them like a bioscope running before my eyes.

My dad tells me stories of his siblings, cousins, my grandfather’s wealth as a zamindar, our legacy as a royal dynasty from East Bengal, and ghosts. My mom, on the other hand, tells me stories of her bus journeys, dance classes, CPI(M), Naxal riots and her foreign travels with her dance troupe.

Though I remember all of them clearly, one episode remains etched in my heart and memory forever as I have faced the same and still do. My mom once told me that she started using a fairness cream when she first heard its advertisement on radio, and at 60, she still uses it. She should be its brand ambassador rather than the actor who endorses it now.

At a time when advertising was limited to radio and newspapers and there wasn’t much marketing propaganda, my mother started using the cream from the very day she heard about it. Why so? My mother is a beautiful Bengali woman, but the stereotypical norms of Indian society forced her to use beauty creams. Even after getting married, she retained such notions of beauty.

I faced the same too, applying the cream apart from sandalwood paste and what not. But now, I don’t care as I turned a rebel with a cause. I am still dusky, I have 15 tattoos, I am on the heavier side, but I am wise, I am intellectually sound, and I am an artist.

I too used the cream for a long time, but now, I just use a moisturiser. It’s not my skin colour that reflects my confidence; my talent does. Indian beauty norms will always say bigoted, but beauty comes from within and everyone is beautiful in his or her own way. I follow this philosophy now but it took me a long time to get there, through being bullied to be laughed at. Now I am proud of myself and I say no to anything that tells me to change myself.

You would be surprised, my mother too has lowered her use of the cream now. From my nostalgic memories, I have cut out the cream.

36,2020/01/19,₹10 in the summer of 1962,"During the summer holidays that last two months or more, parents are under great pressure to keep their children occupied. The pressure was even more in small towns 50 or 60 years ago.

It was in such a township of the Bhilai Steel Plant in May 1962 that I spent two weeks of my summer holidays at my sister’s place. The township was not yet fully developed and avenues for amusements were few. I had no problem as I would spend the day reading.

My sister’s friend living in the township was, however, having a difficult time keeping her eight-year-old son engaged. So my offer to take him out for a day was readily accepted.

Walt Disney cartoons were being screened at a morning show in the township’s only cinema. The next morning, I set off on a bicycle, picked up Vijay and we rode “doubles” to the cinema. He solemnly handed over ₹10 to me, saying his mother had given it to him for snacks and the expenses should not exceed this amount. I equally solemnly assured him I would honour his commitment. Anyway ₹10 in 1962 went a long way. Even the cinema ticket cost barely a rupee!

I bought the tickets and wafers, popcorn and other goodies. Before accepting his share, Vijay asked me anxiously if all this was within his ₹10 limit. I assured him it was so. I was touched by his sincerity and obvious desire to please his mother.

At the interval, we washed down chocolate milk shakes. Once again came the anxious enquiry and I firmly told him he would be keeping his word to his mother.

The show ended and for the hot ride back, we had to have ice creams. This time, my nod sufficed to quell any anxiety he had. Twenty years later, we met. Vijay, now an entrepreneur, recollected his “super” outing. The ₹10 affair seemed to have been forgotten and I had no intention of bringing it up. A further two decades on, we again met. The affection was intact, but even the memory of the outing had faded.

Which was just as well, because to this day he is unaware that the innocent, earnest eight-year-old lad’s ₹10 had been spent by intermission.

37,2020/01/19,Espying the tree of life in steel city,"How will one see a zebra among cows in an Indian city? With surprise and curiosity. I was similarly wonder-struck seeing a big fat tree with bare branches in lush green Jamshedpur. Never had it been counted among the steel city’s flora.

I matched it with the image of a baobab in the movie Lion King and in Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s book The Little Prince. It was indeed a baobab (pronounced beyobaab), or Adansonia digitata, and I came to know that there are approximately 50 of them in India, mostly along the western coast and the central parts. I also learned that the tall columnar baobab (Adansonia grandidiere) shown in the movie Madagascar is mostly limited to that island.

How did an African tree find its way to India? The presence of native baobab trees in Africa, Madagascar and faraway Australia is attributed to the breaking up of Pangaea, the super-continent, 200 million years ago.

Indian tryst

Oceanic dispersal was long held responsible for the introduction of the tree in India and a few other tropical countries. Baobab researchers Bell KL, et al genetically mapped baobab trees in southeast Asia and Africa and applied their findings to historic events of human traffic between the continents. They inferred that baobabs were introduced into India at multiple instances extending from the 15th to 19th centuries, initially by Arabs traders and Mughal invaders and later by Portuguese, Dutch, British and French colonists.

The invaders had captive African men in their workforce who carried baobab fruits as an emergency source of nutrition and aided dispersal of the seeds.

From December to May, the tree has bare branches with a few fruits dangling like rats by their tails. New leaves sprout in June and a few large white flowers lie hidden in the dense canopy. The night-blooming flowers, pollinated by bats, turn into olive green gourd-like fruits, which are hailed as the ultimate super-fruit with 10 times more vitamin C than orange and many minerals.

A baobab can survive for thousands of years in the most arid conditions. The succulent trunk can hold a huge store of water. Radiocarbon dating has identified baobabs as old as 2,450 years. The Little Prince in the French novella feared that baobabs would overpopulate and explode the planet. In reality, Mother Nature maintains a balance between birth and death.

If the tree in my city could talk, I would sit under it, lean on its trunk, and listen to its tales of travel and trade, maharajahs, the Mughals and colonial sahebs and brave men who put up a steel plant in the jungles of Mayurbanj.

38,2020/01/19,Be open to open book exams,"The dawn of the New Year fills most students with anxiety and stress as the annual examinations are fast approaching.

To a large extent, exams in India test only memory power, and hence the dread. Even if a teacher or parent tries to promote learning by exploration, experimentation and enjoyment, students have eventually to yield to rote learning, as exam results are treated as the only benchmark to identify one’s potential in the country.

The result speaks for itself. Every year we produce millions of unemployable graduates and thousands of engineers. In short, we are dispersing mark sheets but no knowledge.

Same menu every year

One of the biggest reasons for this quagmire is the lethargy and intellectural bankruptcy in setting question papers that will test a student’s knowledge and reasoning and analytical abilities. The paper setter usually picks up ready-made questions from highly circulated textbooks and these questions or their clones are repeated each year with astonishing regularity. It is no surprise that the markets are flooded with question banks, which guarantee pass marks.

If it is, however, an open-book examination, the paper setter will have to employ immense imagination, creativity and conceptual clarity. The question paper has to be designed to test a student’s ability in solving problems by understanding what is to be done, where the resource for this has to be sought and how these are to be used. Ultimately, this is what education is supposed to be — to enable students to face real-life problems with the limited resources available. Open-book examinations, apart from getting rid of stress, will obviate cheating.

There are few such reforms that can be implemented without additional financial liability or legislative conflict. Though only a simple executive decision is required to change the examination pattern, it’s baffling to see that the status quo persists. The idea of open-book examinations is not entirely new to the country. While the Gujarat State Board had a limited experiment, Karnataka too thought about implementing it in primary and middle classes. The detractors somehow had their way, and the experiments died prematurely.

Open-book examinations are opposed on multiple grounds. Prominent among them is that students and teachers will become casual in studies with no “fear of exams”. This argument is based on the premise that instead of memorising, students will simply copy from books. However, an open-book examination implies an overhaul of the pattern in which questions are formulated, so that answering each of them requires application of mind. It is found that open-book examinations are tougher as they demand a comprehensive understanding of the subject. Anyone who has not studied the textbook and has not grasped the concepts will keep searching and shuffling pages without any benefit.

Undesirable memorising

Another reason for opposition is that it will dampen the memorising capabilities of children and have a detrimental impact on their performance in competitive examinations. It is a matter of research whether examination patterns determine our memory power. Further, the desirability of memorising information which is otherwise available instantly is questionable.

The All India Council for Technical Education has now taken the lead and decided to adopt open-book examinations gradually for engineering courses.

Will just changing the exam pattern cure the ills of the education system? Certainly not.

A lot depends on how teachers, parents and students perceive this change.

Discarding rote learning and emphasising analytical reasoning will demand a radical shift in the way teachers and students interact. Teachers themselves have to be conceptually clear and must be trained to engage with students in a manner that sparks their curiosity. Given the present state of human resource where there is a stark gap in quality teachers available for the poor, introduction of open-book examinations can be blamed for creating another level of inequality.

We need to reform the education system to prepare our future generation for the technical, economic and emotional challenges that lie ahead. Open-book examinations are just a stepping stone in this direction.

39,2020/01/19,"Footloose on the border, a nomadic life","Two decades ago, at a time of rising tensions on the border, the entire north-west frontier was on high alert. Our detachment camped near a village on the western front. Some of its residents, especially women and children, had already left for the safety of their relatives’ homes away from the forward area.

Whenever I got a free evening, I used to stroll through the narrow road passing by the village. On one such outing, I noticed a flurry of activity under a large banyan tree, near a cattle pond, on the outskirts of the village.

Quick assembly

A large nomadic family had arrived and set up camp near the pond. The speed with which they moved in surprised me because only the previous day, I saw village buffaloes lying there under the shade. Now the nomad’s unyoked oxen were resting there.

Close by, a couple of gaudy carriages reclined. A bundle of hay and a stack of firewood hung under them. Smoke rose from one of the tents. An infant slept in a cloth cradle. An old man with a long moustache sat on a loose bamboo charpoy and smoked. A dog curled up with her puppies cuddled up alongside. Children caked in dust carelessly played around. Garishly dressed women, wearing elaborate jewellery, spoke a strange language and laughed aloud.

Back in my camp, news channels showed that the nation was on edge. More villagers were leaving.

Unmindful of the gripping frenzy, the nomads carried on with their mundane routines. With no newspapers, TV channels, neighbours, political parties, leaders or enemies and no territory to protect, the women chewed sugar cane as they crouched on the ground, men played the flute and children shot catapults. Almost after a fortnight, I went there again. Lo! There was no trace of the nomads or their curious small world. They had vanished.

Only a couple of cooking stones, some cooking ash, and mounds of cow dung were left behind on the levelled ground. I scanned the area to figure out where they could have fled to. Certainly not westward. The border barriers would stop them, for even nomads have to respect the borders, even if they consider themselves citizens of a boundless world.

42,2020/01/19,Uncertainty over January 26 start to Mumbai 24x7,"Despite Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray saying last week that the policy to keep hotels, malls and multiplexes open 24x7 will be implemented in Mumbai from January 27, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday said that the issue will be discussed in Cabinet on Wednesday.

“We have to assess the burden on the city police if shops, eateries and malls are kept open through the night. A decision will be taken after detailed deliberations,” said Mr. Deshmukh.

Mr. Thackeray had last week said,“From January 26, the policy will be implemented in Nariman Point, Kala Ghoda, BKC and mill compounds. It will not cause any trouble. A similar thing has been implemented in Ahmedabad. This move will also generate employment.”

The Home Minister’s statement is being seen as non-commitment of his department to the Mumbai 24x7 project which Mr. Thackeray has been backing for some years now.

The contradictory statements of the Ministers in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government gave ammunition to the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.

“The Home Minister has declared that night life project will not start from January 26. We will continue to oppose any move to keep open hotels, bars, pubs and ladies bars in residential areas for 24 hours,” said BJP MLA Ashish Shelar.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/uncertainty-over-january-26-start-to-mumbai-24x7/article30602077.ece
43,2020/01/19,Housing scheme for Mumbai Police gets a boost,"Maharashtra Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad has announced that a work order on the pending Shantisagar police residence redevelopment will be issued on Wednesday under which 1,700 houses will be built for police personnel.

“The project has been pending for 15 years. It is the duty of the government to ensure that our police personnel get better houses. I held a meeting with Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) officials and we decided to push for the project at the earliest,” said Mr. Awhad following a meeting with the local people on Sunday alongwith SRA Chief Executive Officer Deepak Kapoor.

Mr. Awhad said 1,700 houses will be constructed on a plot is adjacent to the Ramabai Nagar in Ghatkopar. Of these, 900 will be immediately given to police officials. The rest will also be transferred for police housing, he said. The housing scheme has been hanging for more than 15 years now amid allegations of irregularities and favouritism. “This government wants to solve the problem. When I explained the project to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and our party president Sharad Pawar, I was immediately given the green signal for the same,” said Mr. Awhad.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/housing-scheme-for-mumbai-police-gets-a-boost/article30602004.ece
44,2020/01/19,"After 88 years, Mumbai to get mounted police unit","Mumbai Police will get a horse-mounted unit for traffic and crowd control after 88 years, said Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Sunday. The unit will be taking part in this year’s Republic Day parade at Shivaji Park and if needed, similar units will be brought in for Pune and Nagpur.

The mounted unit was disbanded in 1932 due to growing vehicular traffic. “Today, Mumbai police has modern jeeps and motorcycles. However, it was felt a mounted police unit would be useful for crime patrol in crowded areas,” said Mr. Deshmukh, addressing a press conference.

Mr. Deshmukh said that it can be used for crowd control during festivals and marches, at beaches and the rider can keep watch from a good height. “A policeman on horseback was equal to 30 personnel on the ground. The average speed of a patrolling rider will be more than 7 to 10 km than the one on feet,” he said.

The government at present has approved 30 horses, a sub-inspector, one assistant PSI, four havaldars and 32 constables for the unit, which will be successively set up in next six months. A total of 61 trainers from racecourse, riding clubs and the Army’s horse unit will be training the Mumbai police for this. “A stable will be built on a 2.5 acre plot at Marol area of Andheri. A riding school, swimming pool for horses, sand bath, raider room, trainer room, feed stock room will be set up there,” said Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve.

The officers part of this unit will also be trained in show-jumping, tent-pegging, polo. Apart from walkie-talkies, riders would also be supplied with body-mounted cameras for video recording.

The Mumbai police head-quarter will also be hoisting a regimental flag which was given to it in 1954 by the then Chief Minister of Bombay state Morarji Desai.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ufzywy/article30601464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THLTMOUNTEDPOLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/horse-mounted-police-unit-for-mumbai-after-88-years/article30601465.ece

Talking to reporters here on Sunday, VBA leader Prakash Ambedkar alleged that there was unrest in the country over the CAA, which the Centre was trying to implement forcibly.

“The country is on the path of economic bankruptcy. Due to demonetisation and GST, coupled with atmosphere of mistrust in the country, the government is not getting revenue. The economic policies of the Centre are wrong,” he alleged.

Mr. Ambedkar also appealed to political parties andsocial organisations to join the bandh.

46,2020/01/19,"Maharashtra, Karnataka Chief Ministers and Sharad Pawar should meet over Belgaum dispute: Sanjay Raut","Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Sunday said that chief ministers of Maharashtra and Karnataka and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) supremo Sharad Pawar should meet to resolve demands of Marathi-speaking people of Belgaum and nearby areas.

He also said that both the states should accept ruling of the Supreme Court, where a case over the issue is pending since many years. Maharashtra claims Belgaum, part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency but currently a district of Karnataka, on linguistic grounds.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray last month appointed ministers Chhagan Bhujbal and Eknath Shinde as coordinators to oversee his government’s efforts to expedite the case related to the boundary dispute with Karnataka.

Speaking to reporters on Sunday in Belgaum, Mr. Raut said, “The three leaders need to meet to resolve demands of Marathi-speaking people of Belgaum and nearby areas (in Karnakata).”

He also said that the dispute was being heard by the Supreme Court for last 14 years, and both the states should accept the apex court’s verdict.

On Friday, Maharashtra minister of state Rajendra Patil Yadravkar, who is the MLA from Shirol in Kolhapur, went to Belgaum to pay tributes to martyrs of the movement for the merger of Marathi-speaking villages there into Maharashtra.

47,2020/01/19,Mumbai Marathon: 64-year-old runner dies after heart attack,"A 64-year-old man suffered a cardiac arrest and died while he was running in the Tata Mumbai Marathon 2020 on Sunday. As many as 1,350 other runners required medical attention.

The incident occurred at 9 a.m. when Gajanan Maljalkar, a resident of Nallasopara, collapsed after crossing the 4-km mark for senior citizens. He was rushed to the Bombay Hospital by the marathon volunteers but was declared dead upon arrival by the doctors. The body was later taken for post-mortem.

Another runner, Himanshu Thakker, 40, had to undergo an angioplasty after he had a heart attack. Anil Sharma, HOD Cardiology, Bombay Hospital, who performed the angioplasty, said the patient was stable after the procedure and was in ICU for observation. Another participant, Sanjay Bafna, 51, who was running the half-marathon, was admitted in ICU at Bombay Hospital following a brain stroke.

Dr. Vijay D’ Silva, director, critical care and medical affairs, Asian Heart Institute and medical director, Tata Mumbai Marathon and Procam International, said of the 55,322 participants, 1,350 required minor medical assistance.

48,2020/01/19,"Shabana Azmi ‘stable’ after car mishap, FIR lodged against driver","An FIR has been registered against veteran actor Shabana Azmi’s driver for rash and negligent driving, after her car met with an accident on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway in Maharashtra, police said on January 19.

Azmi (69), who was injured in the accident which took place on January 18, is undergoing treatment at Kokilaben Ambani Hospital in suburban Andheri and is “stable”, the hospital’s Executive Director and CEO Dr Santosh Shetty said.

Driver Kamlesh Kamath (38), who sustained minor injuries in the incident, was apparently trying to overtake another vehicle when Azmi’s Tata Safari car rammed into a truck near Khalapur, about 60 km from here in neighbouring Raigad district, a local police official earlier said.

Azmi’s husband, lyricist Javed Akhtar, was travelling in another car, Raigad Superintendent of Police Paraskar said.

“We have booked driver Kamlesh Kamath under Indian Penal Code Sections 279 and 337 for rash and negligent driving and provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act. He is not yet arrested,” Paraskar said.

The car will be sent for an inspection to RTO (regional transport office) to ascertain if there was any fault in the vehicle or if the mishap took place after the driver lost control, he said.

After the incident, Azmi was first rushed to MGM Hospital in Navi Mumbai and later shifted to the Kokilaben Ambani Hospital here.

“We will collect Azmi’s medical report from the MGM Hospital where she was initially taken. The driver’s medical examination was also conducted and he was not found under the influence of alcohol,” Paraskar said.

Meanwhile, Dr. Shetty at the Kokilaben Ambani Hospital said the actor’s health condition is “stable“.

“Azmi is recuperating. She is stable and under observation. No surgery, operation was performed during the night...she is undergoing medical treatment,” he said.

Azmi is known for her path-breaking roles in films like “Arth”, “Ankur”, “Paar”, “Masoom” and “Godmother”.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/yq851y/article30599092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHABANAAZMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/car-mishap-shabana-azmi-stable-fir-lodged-against-driver/article30599093.ece
49,2020/01/19,Three Dharavi constables held for graft,"The Maharashtra Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Saturday arrested three police constables from the Dharavi police station for allegedly demanding and accepting a bribe from a street food stall owner. A civilian, who allegedly accepted the money on their behalf, has also been arrested.

Mysterious call

According to ACB officers, the complainant, a Mumbra resident, had set up a stall to sell biryani, pulao and kebabs at the 90 Feet Road in Dharavi on January 13. A day after he started his business, another vendor in the area told him that police constable Sandip Rane had called him to Dharavi police station.

“The complainant visited the police station and met Mr. Rane, and police constables Mukund Shinde and Sanjay Talekar. Mr. Shinde was posted as the orderly to senior police inspector Suresh Patil, who is in charge of the police station. During the meeting, the policemen demanded ₹32,000 from the complainant,” an ACB officer said.

The officer said the accused even gave a “break-up” to the complainant, saying that ₹6,000 would go to Mr. Patil, ₹12,000 would be distributed among four assistant police inspectors equally, ₹5,000 would be paid to four beat marshalls, ₹3,000 to personnel on board each of the police station’s three patrolling vehicles and ₹6,000 between the three of them, equally.

The complainant approached the ACB’s Mumbai unit and submitted a written complaint against them. During preliminary inquiries, it was confirmed that the three accused constables had demanded the bribe and negotiated the amount down to ₹25,000. “Based on this, we laid a trap and sent the complainant to the police station on Saturday with ₹25,000. Mr. Rane was out at the time but the other two accused told the complainant to hand over the money to Pratik Mehar, who runs a cake shop across the street from the police station,” the officer said.

As soon as Mr. Mehar accepted the money, ACB teams, which were waiting nearby, arrested him, Mr. Shinde and Mr. Talekar. Mr. Rane, too, was arrested later in the day, and all four were charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Officers said searches are currently under way at the offices and residences of all the three constables, and that an inventory of their assets will be made to be compared against their income.

Others involved?

“The claims of the other personnel, including Mr. Shinde, getting a cut are still being verified,” an officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/three-dharavi-constables-held-for-graft/article30597326.ece
50,2020/01/19,PMC Bank depositors gather at city court to oppose accused’s bail pleas,"Around 25 depositors of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank gathered at the sessions court on Saturday to attend the bail hearing of the six arrested in the case.

The court was hearing bail pleas filed by PMC Bank board members Surjit Singh Arora, Gurnam Singh Hothi, Daljeet Singh Bal and three independent auditors arrested by the Economic Offences Wing. They are alleged to have caused losses of ₹4,635.62 crore to the bank by advancing unsecured loans to the Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) Group.

The depositors gathered in the courtroom as the case came up for hearing and started jeering as the accused were brought in. Justice S. Soor then asked the protesters to leave the premises, after which the accused’s lawyers submitted their bail pleas.

‘Review next week’

Advocate Prashant Maggu, representing the depositors, said, “The court has not granted bail to any of the accused and will be reviewing the pleas next week.” The protesters said they will gather in large numbers at the next hearing, which is scheduled for January 24.

“We will be going to the court again on the next hearing to show the number of people who are victimised by the PMC Bank scam. We are in a do-or-die situation. Many of us are single women, while others have medical problems in the family,” Manjula Kotian, a depositor, said.

Suman Chauhan, another depositor, said scores of people had already lost their lives due to the fraud and more lives cannot be risked by extending leniency to the accused.

“We have already started contacting other depositors, asking them to be present at the court for the next hearing. Depositors will gather in large numbers as everyone has promised that minimum two people from each family will be present,” she said.

The account holders will also be holding a protest on Sunday morning outside the bank’s Bandra branch.

“Due to my affected knees, I had to stop all physical activities. But, post surgery I feel renewed and have now worked towards completing the marathon. I was put on fast-track recovery protocol which allowed me to get back on my feet quickly,” Ms. Viseria said.

She was operated upon by Dr. Siddharth M. Shah, consultant orthopaedic and joint replacement surgeon, at SL Raheja Hospital.

“Many people believe that there is lot of pain in post-operative period after such surgeries. Ms. Viseria is breaking this myth. I am very happy to see her take part in the marathon and hope to see her continuing her passion,” Dr. Shah said.

Ms. Viseria also said she had been previously participating in marathons across the nation and used to maintain a healthy life style. “However, last year I began experiencing severe pain in both my knees and that hampered my day-to-day activities,” she said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/d2hbbo/article30597316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BM66-YEAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/66-year-old-raring-to-go-after-knee-replacement/article30597317.ece
52,2020/01/19,Three stroke survivors to cover the distance at the Tata Mumbai Marathon,"Sheer grit will be on display at the Tata Mumbai Marathon, with three Mumbai residents, who had suffered from brain strokes last year, running on Sunday.

Darius Christofids (37), a cyclist, underwent emergency thrombolysis in July after he woke up with half his body completely non-functional. He was rushed to the Nanavati Hospital, where he was treated.

“Dr. Pradyumna Oak, who treated me, suggested that I participate in the marathon a few months back. I have been practising for it since December,” Mr. Christofids, who has also resumed his cycling, said.

Rasiklal Bavalia, a 56-year-old Santacruz resident, has a similar story to share. He suffered a stroke due to high blood pressure in November and was treated at Nanavati as well.

“I was admitted to the hospital but as soon as I returned home, I resumed physical activities. My primary goal behind taking part in the marathon is to empower those who have suffered brain strokes and tell them life doesn’t stop after one,” Mr. Bavalia said.

Manhar Lakhani (70) suffered a stroke during his afternoon nap on November 13. He said though he will not be running, he intends to walk the entire length of the marathon route. “I have been going for walks three times a day ever since I got back from the hospital. Together, we will shatter the myth that a stroke marks the end of one’s mobility.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/k91n6x/article30597283.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMSTROKE-PATIENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/three-stroke-survivors-to-cover-the-distance/article30597284.ece
53,2020/01/19,"Breaking age barriers, one mile at a time","Members of a senior citizens’ group from Panvel, all aged between 70 and 87, will be among the 55,000-odd people running the Mumbai Marathon on Sunday.

Parameswaran Madangarli (70), founder, Jyesth Nagarik Sangh, said he and his fellow members have been participating in the marathon since the inception of the sangh four years ago. “Sixty-one of us will be running the marathon. Taking part in it makes us feel young again. The cheering of crowds from both the sides is simply electrifying,” he said.

Mr. Madangarli said the group members are very excited to take part in the marathon every year. “We gather at the Panvel station at 4 a.m. and catch the first train to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus,” he said.

Talking about the inspiration behind taking part in the marathon, Mr. Madangarli said it was the taunts from young people that drove him towards the initiative. “People usually think that aged people should indulge in devotional activities only. The elderly are sidelined by their family members thinking that they are of no use at their age.”

He also expressed his happiness over increasing number of marathon runners in his organisation. “We started with one participant in the marathon and now we have 61. We have come a long way,” Mr. Madangarli said.

The Jyesth Nagarik Sangh regularly organises tournaments of indoor games like chess and table tennis. There are also facilities for people who want to play cricket and volleyball.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vrcmsp/article30597231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BM-Jeysth-Nagrik-Sangh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/breaking-age-barriers-one-mile-at-a-time/article30597232.ece
54,2020/01/19,"Courage, determination to be on display at Mumbai Marathon","Sixteen Indian Army personnel, who sustained disabilities on the battlefield, will participate in the Tata Mumbai Marathon on Sunday.

The veterans, who hail from across the country, have made India proud in wars and anti-terror operations. They are members of the War Wounded Foundation, an NGO set up by Major General (Retd.) Ian Cardozo for the rehabilitation of disabled soldiers of the Indian Army and the alleviation of their problems.

Maj. Gen. Cardozo said the veterans wear their war wounds like badges of honour. “The Mumbai Marathon gives them an opportunity to interact with other participants and spectators. This not only boosts their morale but also helps them gain confidence,” he said.

Havildar Ashok Kumar, who was a part of Operation Parakram, lost one of his legs from below the knee during the standoff. “I never feel sad about it. In fact the joy of hosting the Indian flag after the successful operation is something that has stayed with me till date. The Mumbai Marathon defines the Indian motto of unity in diversity, as people from all walks of life come together for a common cause,” he said.

Maj. Gen. Cardozo also said taking part in the marathon gives visibility not only to the foundation but also the Indian Army. “The foundation does not get any funds from the government. We work with the donations we get from individuals.”

Among the veterans from the foundation who are participating this year, three have had their legs amputated, five have severe gunshot wounds and one has frostbite injuries.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/c8cx8q/article30597216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMWARVETERANS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/courage-determination-to-be-on-display-at-mumbai-marathon/article30597217.ece
55,2020/01/19,Sena to serve up Shiv bhojan from Republic Day,"The State will identify 20,000-odd beneficiaries for its flagship Shiv bhojan scheme through a face-recognition software developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC).

Senior government officials said the ₹10 plate of wholesome food for the needy, designed on the lines of Tamil Nadu’s Amma canteen, will be first served outside 20 hospitals and government offices starting this Republic Day.

The NIC, attached to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India, will identify the first-time beneficiary, linking them to Aadhaar to avoid duplication, and ascertain identity.

“The Tamil Nadu Government has provided personalised cards to users. We too want to put in place a mechanism whereby the beneficiaries are identified and linked to a delivery mechanism. A face-recognition software from NIC will help us do that and ensure food is not served to the same person twice,” said a senior government official.

Food Supply and Consumer Affairs Minister Chhagan Bhujbal said that 20 locations have been shortlisted as a pilot. However, the Maha Vikas Agadhi (MVA) government was keen to ensure that scheme is a success, and it would be extended across the State, he said. “Funding is the least of our concerns. We now estimate that the scheme will run for sometime without any external help. We are looking to run it on a long-term basis after a year’s trial,” he told The Hindu.

The ₹10 meal will serve two chapattis, a 100 gm serving of vegetables, 150 gm rice and 100 gm dessert daily during lunch hours.

56,2020/01/19,ATS gets Ansari’s transit custody for three days,"The Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) on Saturday received transit custody of Mumbai serial blasts convict Jalees Ansari, who was detained in Uttar Pradesh on Friday after jumping parole.

Ansari (68), convicted for carrying out a string of blasts across the country from 1989 to 1992, went missing from his Mominpura residence on Thursday while on parole from Ajmer Central Jail. He was detained in Kanpur on Friday in a joint operation between the ATS and the U.P. Special Task Force.

An ATS officer said, “We have received transit custody of Ansari for three days. During this period, we have to bring him back to Mumbai and produce him before a local court. An ATS team will leave with him for Mumbai on Saturday night.”

The officer also said the ATS would be seeking Ansari’s custody so that he can be interrogated before being sent back to prison to resume his life sentence.

He said, “The priority is to find out if anyone was helping him to cross the border into Nepal so action can be taken against them. We need to find out how he was planning to get into Nepal and what his later plans were.”

The ATS has found out that Ansari went to Kanpur hoping to secure help from two childhood friends. However, it was only after he visited their residences that he learnt that one of them had passed away a year ago and the other one was not present in Kanpur. Ansari then made inquiries about viable travel options to enter Nepal, but he was intercepted and detained, sources said.

Another ATS officer said, “He was holding the hand of a boy, who was around 10 years old, when he was caught. Inquiries have confirmed that he was taking cover at a local mosque to plan out his next step. During this time, he struck up a conversation with a resident and offered to watch his son for a while. Having a small boy with him was an effective way of blending in and anyone looking for him would not have spotted him easily. His actions testify that age does not seem to have dulled his wits.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/au6u7r/article30590231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Jalis-Ansari,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ats-gets-ansaris-transit-custody-for-three-days/article30597166.ece
57,2020/01/19,‘A new raga is like a newborn’,"In a coming together of the visual and performing arts, young sarod maestros, Amaan Ali Bangash and Ayaan Ali Bangash from the Senia Bangash gharana, will perform on Sunday evening in a concert, ‘Strokes and Strings’, with celebrated artist Paresh Maity.

Maity, a Padma Shri awardee, will be painting live on stage while the Bangash siblings play classical music compositions. Ayaan says, “We will choose ragas that give our interpretation of these nine emotions [rasas] which will be executed on canvas by Paresh Maity.”

Musical legacy

The brothers come from a long line of illustrious musicians and are the seventh generation of their gharana. “To be a musician is a blessing, as you are really not answerable to anyone but yourself. For those few hours when you are on stage, you are in a creative frenzy,” says Amaan, adding to which Ayaan emphasises on the fact that being Ustad Amjad Ali Khan’s son, is a matter of great honour. “My father’s music, no doubt is the real inspiration but so is his humility, simplicity, and politeness. Almost unreal for a man of his stature.”

Ayaan also talks about their mother’s role in their lives, “Being an artiste who learned from the great Rukmini Devi Arundale, she sacrificed her career for the family.”

Amaan believes that children of this generation should be exposed to music every day. “It is the duty of every parent and school teachers to [discover] creative instincts in every child because it is very healthy for the mind and body of the child to express his creative instincts.” To this Ayaan adds that every human being is born with sound and rhythm. “Some realise this and some don’t. The heartbeat is an indication of rhythm and what we speak; conversation, recitation, chanting, and singing is all part of music,” he says.

While talking about their grandfather Ustaad Hafiz Ali Khan, Amaan emphasises the fact that his grandfather was initiated in the tradition of the Senia Gharana by the direct descendant of the line of Swami Haridas and Miyan Tansen and also talked about him learning from the legendary Ustad Wazir Khan of Rampur. “Ustad Wazir Khan broke the convention of teaching only family members and accepted him as his disciple. Now a disciple of the Tansen School, Haafiz Ali Khan started flowering under his ustad’s teaching. Haafiz Ali Khan’s strict adherence to dhrupad made the veterans of his time look at him with admiration,” says Ayaan.

Creative process

On composing music, Amaan compares a new raga to a baby. He believes that a raga is much more than a mere scale, it is a living identity. “When a child is conceived, in this case a raga invoked, how can you not accept the raga? The raga would ask me, ‘Do you know me?’ and if you say I don’t, then you have to give it a name and hence the raga becomes new, just like an offspring,” he says.

Amaan feels that there is no logical explanation as to why a raga is seasonal or why certain ragas with the same combination of notes are played at different times of the day. “Morning ragas have a certain calmness and depth that an artiste is able to achieve with the choice of ragas, that we have in our treasury of music. But it is much more than a scale which also refers to the set of notes. A raga has distinctive features with prominent notes, combinations of notes and timings of the day and season.”

For now, Ayaan is looking forward to performing with his father’s sarod concerto with Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra later this year. “I am also excited about the release of our album, String for Peace, with the multiple Grammy award-winner classical guitarist Sharon Isbin,” he concludes.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/p3eq9y/article30597123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMParesh-Maity,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-new-raga-is-like-a-newborn/article30597124.ece
58,2020/01/19,HC stays order of Information Commissioner,"The Bombay High Court has held that the Right to Information Act does not empower the Central Information Commission to appoint a committee to conduct inquiry on its behalf.

A Division Bench of Justices K.K. Tated and S.V. Kotwal was hearing a petition filed by the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO), Security, Printing & Minting Corporation of India Limited. The plea challenged an order passed an Information Commissioner on April 28, 2017, directing the chief managing director and Joint Secretary (Currency), Department of Economic Affairs, to conduct an inquiry into allegations against the CPIO. The commissioner directed the authorities to submit its report within 15 days.

The advocate appearing for the CPIO told the court that the order was beyond jurisdiction. On July 19, 2017, a single Bench had said, “Bare reading of the order passed by the commissioner under the Act shows he delegated his power to the committee.”

The court also mentioned a Delhi High Court judgement that said there is no provision under the Act for the commissioner to delegate powers to a third party. The court issued notices to the commissioner and adjourned the matter for 12 weeks.

59,2020/01/19,Thermal screening for travellers from China,"All passengers arriving in Mumbai from China will have to undergo thermal screening as a precautionary measure with immediate effect. The Mumbai International Airport Limted (MIAL) said the decision was taken in the wake of a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan city, in China’s Hubei province.

A MIAL spokesperson said, “All passengers travelling from China to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA), will have to undergo a thermal screening as a matter of precaution.” CSMIA has two airlines — Air China and Rwand Air — catering to passengers travelling to and from China.

Health counter opened

The Airport Health Organisation (APHO) team in Mumbai has activated a health counter and thermal scanners at the pre-immigration area for the passengers.

The airport has expanded its passenger safety measures in compliance with the latest directive issued by the World Health Organization (WHO) in case if a traveller is detected with the symptom.

The spokesperson said, “The concerned passenger will be shifted to the isolation hospital earmarked for CSMIA on advice of the APHO team. The airport will share a daily report with the ministry on the scanning of passengers.” APHO officials said as reported by the Chinese authorities, this is a new type of coronavirus and is different from all other human coronaviruses.

In an advisory to passengers, MIAL said the WHO had reported symptoms such as fever, difficulty in breathing and chest radiographs showing bilateral lung infiltrates as the cause of the pneumonia.

MIAL in a statement said to reduce the risk of acute respiratory infections while travelling in or from affected areas, passengers should avoid close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections; frequently wash their hands, especially after coming into direct contact with ill people or their environment; and avoid contact with live or dead farm or wild animals.

Travellers with symptoms of acute respiratory infection should practise cough etiquette: maintain distance, cover coughs and sneezes with disposable tissues or clothing, and wash hands.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ky3yh6/article30596592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/thermal-screening-for-travellers-from-china/article30596593.ece
60,2020/01/19,All eyes on Djokovic and Serena in Australian Open,"Old-stagers Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams will aim to keep the younger generation of players waiting in the wings as Grand Slam tennis enters a new decade at the Australian Open on Monday.

After recent bushfire smog largely cleared in Melbourne, the view is all too familiar with Djokovic and Serena, who is seeking a record-equalling 24th Major title, installed as the bookies’ favourites.

Nadal is top seed

Top seed Rafael Nadal, 33, is celebrating becoming World No. 1 in a third decade while Roger Federer, 38, is trying to defy the ageing process and stay ahead of his rivals with a 21st Grand Slam win.

The start of 2020 is not dissimilar to 2010, when Federer and Nadal shared the four Grand Slam titles and Serena won in Melbourne and Wimbledon.

Serena eyes Court’s record

Ten years later, the men’s Big Three — who have won all but two Australian Open titles since 2004 — occupy the top three rankings, and Serena is one step away from Margaret Court’s record for Grand Slam victories.

Several challengers have come and gone but there is increasing hope for the men’s up-and-comers, while nine women have won Grand Slam titles since Williams, 38, claimed her 23rd in Melbourne in 2017.

While Djokovic and Nadal split last year’s Grand Slams, Dominic Thiem, Daniil Medvedev and Fabio Fognini won their first Masters trophies and Stefanos Tsitsipas, 21, became the youngest ATP Finals champion in 18 years.

“They’re very close. I don’t think that’s miles, miles away maybe as it was some years ago,” Djokovic of the NextGen winning a Major title.

The clash between old and new will be epitomised in the first round on Monday, when Venus Williams, who turns 40 this year, plays 15-year-old rising star Coco Gauff — who wasn’t even born when her fellow American lifted her first Grand Slam trophies in 2000.

Japan’s Naomi Osaka, 22, is defending a title for the second Grand Slam in a row after her repeat bid at last year’s US Open fell flat in the fourth round.

61,2020/01/19,Bob Bryan backs Andy Murray to march on,"Doubles legend Bob Bryan is backing Andy Murray to play for many more years despite the Briton being forced out of the Australian Open with another injury.

The veteran American had a major hip operation in 2018 but bounced back to continue his hugely successful doubles partnership with twin Mike.

Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray had similar, career-saving surgery 12 months ago, and in October he won his first title since going under the knife.

But, the 32-year-old pulled out of the Australian Open with a pelvic injury and last week further delayed his comeback, renewing fears for his future in the game.

“I talked to him last week,” the 41-year-old Bryan said. “All his numbers are off the charts, he tests the speed and the strength. He’s right back where he was when he was number one, which is incredible. That’s good to hear, Bryan added.

Murray has taken inspiration from Bryan as the Briton attempts to recapture a semblance of the form and fitness that made him world number one in 2016.

Bryan said that he has no issues with his hip. Murray has consistently said that he is also pain-free, but the pelvic problem is a fresh setback.

The American cited a recent documentary about Murray which charted the Briton’s painstaking comeback. “If anyone saw the documentary, you’ll know how crazy he is with the work, he’s a madman,” Bryan said.

“He’s going to put it in, he’s going to do everything he can. “I expect to see him playing for many more years, winning,” added Bryan.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/r1frju/article30599309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANDYMURRAY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/bob-bryan-backs-andy-murray-to-march-on/article30599311.ece
62,2020/01/19,Australian Open | Kyrgios dismisses Zverev’s comments,"Australia’s Nick Kyrgios dismissed criticism from Alexander Zverev on Saturday after the German said he was a step behind some of his main rivals when it came to challenging for Grand Slams.

Zverev said some of the other young players were “just better” than Kyrgios, who provocatively dropped and did push-ups when the World No. 7 served double-faults during Germany’s clash with Australia at the ATP Cup.

“I’m not going to entertain that too much. With everything going on, that’s the least of my worries,” said Kyrgios, who has been at the forefront of fund-raising efforts for Australia’s bushfire crisis.

“He’s a great player. I’m not quite sure where those comments come from. I’m sure he didn’t mean them in a bad way. But if he did, then I’m sorry for whatever I’ve done to you,” he said.

Zverev told media in Melbourne that “there’s a lot of young guys that are right now, no offence, just better than (Kyrgios). I think Stefanos (Tsitsipas) is better than him. Just simply because he is better over five sets and that’s what you need as well.”

Hard to focus

However, Kyrgios said he was finding it hard to focus on his home Grand Slam after the emotions caused by the deadly bushfire disaster, which has torched swathes of countryside and thousands of homes.

“I guess my mind is still not completely on the tennis side of things,” the 24-year-old said.

“It’s tough. The fires, I mean, if you get down to it, people are losing their families, homes,” he added.

“It’s not easy to just completely switch your concentration on the Australian Open —how is your forehand going today? - when you put it in perspective of what is actually going on.”

The coachless Kyrgios, ranked 26th in the world, also said he had no plans to take up John McEnroe on his offer of acting as a mentor.

“I think me and Mack, we’ll just stick to having some beers together. That’s about it,” he said.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/1vlf4t/article30595673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19NICK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-kyrgios-dismisses-zverevs-comments/article30595674.ece

64,2020/01/19,"Ahead of holiday, China gears up to contain virus outbreak","China will step up efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays. With 17 new cases of the virus having been confirmed, fears have risen that the virus could spread to other countries. Three of the new patients are seriously ill.

The National Health Commission said on January 10 that departments should work together to carry out preventative measures.

“Our Commission will step up our guard during the Spring Festival, pay close attention to the development and change of the epidemic, and direct the implementation of prevention and control measures,” the Commission said.

Many of China’s 1.4 billion people will travel domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year break that begins next week, raising concerns about the virus spreading.

Wuhan’s health authority earlier on January 19 confirmed 17 more cases of the virus in the city, bringing the total number of known patients there to 62.

Also Read Indian school teacher in Shenzhen treated for streptococcal infection

Two people have died from the virus in the city, the largest in central China.

Three cases of the infection have been confirmed abroad — two in Thailand and one in Japan — involving people from Wuhan or those who recently visited the city.

China, the World Health Organisation and authorities across the globe are stepping up efforts to contain the virus, which initially emerged in Wuhan in late December 2019 as a wave of pneumonia patients.

The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that also started in China.

Though some experts say the new virus may not be as deadly as SARS, there is still little known about it including its origin and how easily it can be transmitted between humans.

The WHO said on January 19 that some of the new cases appear not to be linked to the Huanan seafood market, believed earlier to be the centre of the outbreak. Due to China’s efforts to implement broader screening, new cases may be identified in the coming days and weeks, the WHO added.

“The fact that three cases have been exported to Thailand and Japan without connection to the Huanan Seafood Market suggests that the virus has spread beyond the Huanan Seafood Market into the community,” said David Hui, a professor of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Wuhan will strengthen oversight of big events and reduce the number of public gatherings, state media quoted Chen Yanxin, the city’s deputy mayor as saying on January 19.

Wuhan officials said since January 14 they are using infrared thermometers at airports, railway stations and other passenger terminals in the city to strengthen screening. Airport authorities in the United States as well as most Asian nations are screening passengers from Wuhan.

Trouble flared when police ordered the authorised gathering to disperse after officers conducting stop and searches on nearby streets had water bottles and paint thrown at them by angry crowds.

A group of plainclothes officers who were speaking with organisers were then set upon by masked protesters, who beat them with umbrellas and sticks, an AFP reporter on the scene said.

Two officers were seen with bloody head wounds as colleagues shielded them from further attacks. “We strongly condemn all the rioters and violent acts,” police spokesman Ng Lok-chun told reporters.

Video posted online showed an organiser asking the officers to show their warrant cards which they did not, a frequent gripe among protesters.

Rally organiser Ventus Lau said he believed police should “shoulder the greatest responsibility for the clashes” because they took too long to show their warrant cards.

Mr. Lau was later arrested for obstructing officers, police and rally organisers confirmed.

Soon, riot police swept into the area and fired tear gas to disperse the crowds.

Brief cat and mouse clashes ensued with police making multiple arrests, including one protester who had blood streaming from the back of his head.

Hong Kong's protests have raged for seven months after being sparked by a now-abandoned proposal to allow extraditions to the authoritarian mainland, where the opaque legal system answers to the Communist Party.

They soon morphed into a wider movement calling for greater freedoms in what is the most concerted challenge to Beijing's rule since the former British colony's 1997 handover.

At Sunday's rally, thousands gathered in the heart of the Central commercial district, chanting slogans such as “Stand with Hong Kong, fight for freedom”.

Some waved American, British and Hong Kong independence flags. There were many families and children present with a peaceful atmosphere until police ordered the crowds to leave.

The frequency and ferocity of Hong Kong's protests have died down over the last month, but signs of the political unrest are everywhere, from graffiti daubed on walls to huge fences surrounding government buildings.

The city's police force is now loathed by large swathes of the city, heckled by crowds both at protest sites and in their local neighbourhoods.

Critics accuse police of using excessive force, with no police officer disciplined or punished in the last seven months of protests.

Police say they have used force commensurate with the levels of violence they face from hardcore protesters who routinely throw bricks and petrol bombs.

The force has blamed viral social media videos of officers making hard arrests and media coverage for their plummeting reputation among the city's inhabitants.

Among key demands of the protest movement are an independent inquiry into the police, an amnesty for 7,000 people arrested and fully free elections.

Beijing and local leader Carrie Lam have refused further concessions and defended police tactics.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-officials-hurt-as-hong-kong-rally-turns-violent/article30601588.ece
66,2020/01/19,Libya summit seeks end to foreign meddling,"World leaders made a fresh push for peace in Libya at a summit in Berlin on Sunday, in a desperate bid to stop the conflict-wracked nation from turning into a “second Syria”.

The Presidents of Russia, Turkey and France joined other global chiefs at the talks hosted by Chancellor Angela Merkel and held under the auspices of the United Nations.

The summit’s main goal is to get foreign powers wielding influence in the region to stop interfering in the war — be it through weapons, troops or financing.

Haftar in Leaders of both warring factions — strongman Khalifa Haftar and the head of Tripoli’s UN-recognised government Fayez al-Sarraj — were also in Berlin for the first such gathering since 2018.

But pro-Haftar forces upped the ante ahead of the talks by blocking oil exports at Libya’s key ports, crippling the country’s main income source in protest at Turkey’s decision to send troops to shore up Mr. Sarraj’s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA).

Ahead of the talks, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan lashed out at Mr. Haftar, saying he needed to drop his “hostile attitude” if Libya is to have any chance at winning peace.

The flaring oil crisis underlined the devastating impact of foreign influence in the conflict, in which Mr. Sarraj’s GNA is backed by Turkey and Qatar while Mr. Haftar has the support of Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.

“Libya needs all foreign interference to stop,” the United Nations’ special envoy Ghassan Salame told AFP.

The UN hopes all sides will sign up to a plan to refrain from interference, and commit to a truce that leads to a lasting end to hostilities, according to a draft of a final communique seen by AFP.

That document also urges all parties to re-commit to a much-violated UN arms embargo and raises the prospect of intra-Libyan political talks in Geneva at the end of the month.

If all goes to plan, the Berlin participants will hold an evening press conference.

But the summit has already ruffled feathers with several countries in the region fuming at being left out, including Greece, Morocco and Tunisia.

‘Second Syria’

Libya has been torn by fighting between rival armed factions since a 2011 NATO-backed uprising killed dictator Moamer Kadhafi.

Most recently, Mr. Sarraj’s troops in Tripoli have been under attack since April from Haftar’s forces.

Clashes killed more than 280 civilians and 2,000 fighters and displaced tens of thousands, until a fragile ceasefire backed by both Ankara and Moscow was put in place on January 12.

At follow-up talks in Moscow, Sarraj agreed to a permanent truce but Haftar walked away without signing the deal.

In the latest apparent ceasefire violation, GNA forces on Sunday accused Haftar’s militia of opening fire on them in southern Tripoli.

Although Mr. Sarraj’s government is recognised by the UN, powerful players have broken away to stand behind Haftar -- turning a domestic conflict into what some have described as a proxy war in which international powers jostle to secure their own interests.

Alarm grew after Erdogan ordered troops to Libya early January to bolster Mr. Sarraj, while Russia has been accused of sending in mercenaries to help Haftar as Moscow seeks to extend its influence in the region.

Underlining the stakes involved, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said “we have to make sure Libya doesn’t become a second Syria.”

Mr. Sarraj meanwhile issued a plea for international “protection troops” if Haftar were to keep up his offensive, echoeing a similar call by the EU’s chief diplomat Josep Borrell.

With the idea gathering pace, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country would be ready to send “people and experts” to help monitor a Libya ceasefire.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte likewise said his country “is ready to bring its contribution”.

Low hopes

Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly urged Europe to stand united behind Sarraj’s government, warning that Tripoli’s fall could allow jihadist groups like the Islamic State or Al-Qaeda to regroup.

He has also cautioned that further unrest could prompt a new wave of migrants to head for Europe.

For Turkey, a fall of Sarraj’s GNA could jeopardise a maritime boundary agreement the parties signed. It gives Ankara extensive rights over the eastern Mediterranean where the recent discovery of undersea gas reserves has triggered a scramble by littoral states.

With so many regional rivals and competing interests facing off, Wolfram Lacher, Libya expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, was sceptical about the chances of a Berlin breakthrough.

“Nobody believes that the states involved will really respect the arms embargo” after ignoring it for years, he told AFP.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/libya-summit-seeks-end-to-foreign-meddling/article30601536.ece
67,2020/01/19,Indian school teacher in Shenzhen treated for streptococcal infection,"A 45-year-old Indian school teacher is undergoing treatment following the outbreak of a new strain of pneumonia spreading in the Chinese cities of Wuhan and Shenzhen, becoming the first foreigner to have contracted the mysterious SARS-like coronavirus.

Preeti Maheshwari, a teacher at an international school in Shenzhen, has been admitted to a local hospital after she fell seriously ill last Friday. Doctors on Monday confirmed that she was suffering from the virus and is being treated for it, her husband Ashuman Khowal told PTI from Shenzhen.

The virus has caused alarm because of its connection to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) which killed nearly 650 people in China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003. Mr. Khowal, a businessman from Delhi, said Ms. Maheswari was being treated in the intensive care unit and is currently being kept on ventilator and other supporting systems. Mr. Khowal, who is allowed to visit the patient for a few hours every day, said she was unconscious and doctors have said she could take a long time to recover.

According to reports from Wuhan, where the virus started surfacing a few weeks ago, 17 new cases have been reported, taking the total number of cases to 62. A total of 19 have been cured and discharged from the hospital, and the rest remain in isolation and are receiving treatment, State-run Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday.

Two people in Shenzhen are currently in quarantine at the Third People’s Hospital, which specialises in the treatment of infectious diseases, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported. India on Friday issued an advisory to its nationals visiting China following a second death due to the outbreak of the new strain of pneumonia in the Chinese city of Wuhan where over 500 Indian medical students are studying.

Travel advisory issued

“An infection with a novel coronavirus has been reported from China. As on 11th January, 2020, 41 confirmed cases have been reported so far,” said the travel advisory issued by India. Travel-related cases have been reported one each in Thailand and Japan.

Over 500 Indian students study in the Wuhan city’s medical colleges in universities. But most of them appear to have left for home for the Chinese New Year holidays. The clinical signs and symptoms are mainly fever with a few patients having difficulty breathing, the Indian travel advisory said. Mode of transmission is unclear as of now. However, so far there is little evidence of significant human-to-human transmission, it said.

The patients showed symptoms such as fever or cough, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said. Epidemiological investigations into the 17 new cases are under way and close contacts are being traced, the authority said, adding that Wuhan will continue to expand the search area, identify suspected cases and conduct sampling tests.

Epidemiological analysis of previously published cases found that some cases had no exposure to Wuhan’s Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is believed to be related to most of the infected cases. It has been temporarily closed while disinfection is carried out, the Xinhua report said.

A total of 681 among 763 close contacts who were placed under medical observation have been released.

68,2020/01/19,Iran backtracks on plan to send flight recorders to Ukraine,"The Iranian official leading the investigation into the Ukrainian jetliner that was accidentally shot down by the Revolutionary Guard appeared to backtrack on January 19 on plans to send the flight recorders abroad for analysis, a day after saying they would be sent to Kyiv.

Hassan Rezaeifar was quoted by the state-run IRNA news agency as saying the flight recorders from the Ukrainian Boeing are in Iranian hands and we have no plans to send them out.

He said Iran is working to recover the data and cabin recordings, and that it may send the flight recorders — commonly known as black boxes — to Ukraine or France. But as of yet, we have made no decision. The same official was quoted by the semi-official Tasnim news agency on January 18 as saying the recorders would be sent to Ukraine, where French, American and Canadian experts would help analyse them. Iranian officials previously said the black boxes were damaged but are usable.

It was not immediately possible to reconcile the conflicting accounts. Iran may be hesitant to turn over the recorders for fear that more details from the crash — including the harrowing 20 seconds between when the first and second surface-to-air missiles hit the plane — will come to light.

The Guard’s air defences shot the plane down shortly after it took off from Tehran on January 8, killing all 176 people on board.

Hours earlier, the Guard had launched ballistic missiles at U.S. troops in Iraq in response to the U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s top general in Baghdad. Officials say lower-level officers mistook the plane for a U.S. cruise missile.

Iranian officials initially said the crash was caused by a technical problem and invited countries that lost citizens to help investigate. Three days later, Iran admitted responsibility after Western leaders said there was strong evidence the plane was hit by a surface-to-air missile.

The victims included 57 Canadian citizens as well as 11 Ukrainians, 17 people from Sweden, four Afghans and four British citizens. Most of those killed were Iranians.

The other five nations have demanded Iran accept full responsibility and pay compensation to the victims’ families.

The plane was a Boeing 737-800 that was designed and built in the U.S. The plane’s engine was designed by CFM International, a joint company between French group Safran and U.S. group GE Aviation. Investigators from both countries have been invited to take part in the probe.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/zbwhl8/article30599992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-CRASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-backtracks-on-plan-to-send-flight-recorders-to-ukraine/article30599993.ece
69,2020/01/19,"China says 17 new cases in virus outbreak, Wuhan to restrict large gatherings","China said on Sunday that 17 more people had become infected with a new coronavirus strain, fanning fears it will spread further as hundreds of millions of people travel to celebrate the upcoming Lunar New Year.

Three of those patients are seriously ill, according to a statement issued by the health commission in the central city of Wuhan, where all 62 of the cases in China have occurred.

Two people have died. Two cases have also been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, each involving people who travelled from Wuhan.

Wuhan officials have been providing updates on new cases almost daily since January 11, and 17 is the highest number reported since then.

The World Health Organization said in a tweet on Sunday that some of the new cases appear not to be linked to the Huanan seafood market, which is believed to the centre of the outbreak. Due to China's efforts to implement broader screening, new cases may be identified in the coming days and weeks, it added.

“The fact that three cases have been exported to Thailand and Japan without connection to the Huanan Seafood Market suggests that the virus has spread beyond the Huanan Seafood Market into the community,” said David Hui, a professor of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Chinese health authorities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Wuhan will strengthen oversight of large-scale events and reduce the number of activities that involve public gatherings, State media quoted Chen Yanxin, the city's deputy mayor as saying on Sunday.

Wuhan officials said that since January 14 they are using infrared thermometers at airports, railway stations and other passenger terminals in the city to strengthen screening.

Airport authorities in the United States as well as most Asian nations are also screening passengers from Wuhan.

The new virus is from the same large family of coronaviruses that includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002-03 outbreak that also started in China.

Although experts say the new virus does not appear to be as lethal as SARS, there is little knwoledge about its origins and how easily it can spread.

The 17 new patients began exhibiting symptoms such as a fever or cough before January 13, the statement in Wuhan said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/r2dp1n/article30599572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19CHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-says-17-new-cases-in-virus-outbreak-wuhan-to-restrict-large-gatherings/article30599565.ece
70,2020/01/19,"Trump marks U.S.-Japan security pact with call for stronger, deeper alliance","President Donald Trump marked the 60th anniversary of the signing of the security treaty between the United States and Japan with a call for a stronger and deeper alliance between the two countries, despite criticising the pact six months ago.

“As the security environment continues to evolve and new challenges arise, it is essential that our alliance further strengthen and deepen,” Mr. Trump said in a statement dated Jan. 18.

“I am confident that in the months and years ahead, Japan's contributions to our mutual security will continue to grow, and the alliance will continue to thrive.”

Last June, Mr. Trump told a news conference in Japan that the treaty - signed six decades ago on Sunday and the linchpin of Japan's defence policy - was “unfair” and should be changed, echoing his long-held view that Japan is a free-rider on defence.

Mr. Trump at the time added he was not thinking of withdrawing from the pact.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday called for making the treaty more robust.

“We have elevated the relationship to one in which each of us, the U.S. and Japan, protects the other, thereby giving further force to the alliance,” Mr. Abe said at a Tokyo reception to mark the anniversary of the signing.

“Going forward, it is incumbent upon us to make it even more robust, to make it a pillar for safeguarding peace and security in both outer space and cyberspace.”

The treaty obligates the United States to defend Japan, which under its U.S.-drafted constitution renounced the right to wage war after World War Two. Japan in return provides military bases used by the United States to project power in Asia.

The treaty was first signed in 1951 and revised in 1960 under Abe's grandfather, then-premier Nobusuke Kishi. Kishi was forced to step down afterwards following a massive public outcry from Japanese critics who feared the pact would pull their country into conflict.

Mr. Abe since taking office in 2012 has raised Japan's defence spending by 10% after years of decline and his government in 2014 reinterpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight overseas for the first time since World War Two.

Although generally supportive of the alliance, Japanese voters remain concerned about their country getting dragged into U.S.-led conflicts. A recent survey by Kyodo news agency showed 58.4% opposed Tokyo's decision to dispatch a warship and patrol planes to the Middle East to help protect ships bringing goods to Japan.

Trump's administration has also pushed for Japan to pay more for U.S. forces stationed in the country. Under an agreement reached in 2015, Japan pledged to increase its spending for U.S. forces stationed there by 1.4% over the following five years to 189.3 billion yen ($1.72 billion) per year on average.

71,2020/01/19,At least eight dead in blaze at Czech home for the elderly,"At least eight people died and thirty were injured after a fire at a home for people with learning disabilities in a western Czech town early on Sunday, rescuers said.

“A total of 38 people were affected by the fire, of them eight unfortunately died,” emergency services spokesman Prokop Volenik told AFP.

He said 30 people were taken to hospital — one in a critical condition, three with serious injuries and 26 with light or no injuries.

Czech media said the firehad been put out.

“The fire broke out in the boys’ section of a home for the mentally handicapped,” said Jitka Gavdunova, the Mayor of Vejprty, a small town on the German border some 100 km northwest of Prague.

Mr. Volenik said all of those affected were adults.

The broadsheet DNES daily quoted Ms. Gavdunova as saying the clients of the home had tried to set it on fire in the past, and that the home was understaffed.

People from the town tried to help when the fire broke out but eight clients suffocated. “The Deputy Mayor ran into the fire to help the clients and he paid for it. He’s now in hospital under observation,” said Ms. Gavdunova.

She told DNES the clients could walk around town freely, and that the home had fire sensors but only at the toilets used by the clients as smoking rooms.

“We should not be so benevolent with people whose mental age is six to twelve years,” said the mayor.

Police said on Twitter they were investigating the fire as criminal negligence.

Originally, rescuers said the fire had occurred at a nearby home for the elderly.

“It’s insane, we’re swamped with phone calls from the relatives of the pensioners,” Ms. Gavdunova told AFP.

Mr. Volenik said it was too early to talk about the causes of the blaze.

He added seven ambulance units including two German ones had been deployed.

73,2020/01/19,"7 missing, over 150 rescued after Nepal avalanche","Four South Koreans and three Nepali guides remain missing following an avalanche near the Annapurna mountain range, while over 150 domestic and foreign tourists have been rescued from in and around the area, officials said.

The incessant snowfall caused the avalanche near a popular trekking route in the Himalayan country. The area is close to the base camp for Annapurna, one of the highest peaks in the Himalayas.

“Four South Koreans and three Nepalis, guides and porters and who were separated from their nine—member group are still out of contact as over 150 Nepalis and foreigners rescued from around the area on Saturday alone,” Bhim Gurung, chairman of ward No—11 of the Annapurna Rural Municipality, told Xinhua on Saturday evening.

Efforts to mobilize helicopters for the rescue operation were hampered by continued bad weather.

“But we could not land the helicopters at the main avalanche-hit area from where trekkers are missing,” said Yogesh Sapkota, chief marketing officer at Simrik Air, which was involved in the evacuation on Saturday.

As his company rescued 80 to 100 trekkers, Mr. Sapkota said, there was almost no trekker left in Annapurna base camp area.

“Around 40 people have already arrived in capital Kathmandu while many reached the nearest city Pokhara,” he added.

Despite rescue efforts on Saturday, helicopter companies and trekking agencies said that the situation of the seven people missing remained unknown.

“Search operation is underway but it has not been effective due to bad weather,” Sirata Lama, general secretary of Trekking Agencies’ Association of Nepal (TAAN), an umbrella organization of trekking companies present in the country, told Xinhua on Saturday evening.

74,2020/01/19,Russia strike kills five civilians in northwest Syria: monitor,"An air strike Saturday by Syrian regime ally Russia killed five civilians, including four members of the same family, in an opposition bastion in the country’s northwest, a monitor said.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said three children were among those killed after midnight Friday in the village of Bala in the jihadist-run Idlib region.

“A man, his wife, and their two little girls were among those killed,” said the head of the Britain-based monitoring group, Rami Abdel Rahman.

An AFP correspondent at a hospital in the area saw the bodies of two of the children wrapped up in thick winter blankets.

The strike created a massive crater of rubble near a two-storey home flanked by an empty outdoor swimming pool, the correspondent said.

A rescue worker found a stuffed toy cockerel inside the building.

Another first responder retrieved two slain rabbits.

The Observatory, which relies on sources inside Syria for its information, says it determines who carried out air strikes according to flight patterns as well as aircraft and ammunition involved.

The Idlib region has witnessed an uptick in violence this week, as the Syrian government presses a deadly offensive despite a ceasefire arranged by its Russian ally and rebel-backer Turkey.

Home to three million people, the jihadist-run bastion is made up of a large part of the Idlib province, as well as slivers of the neighbouring Aleppo and Latakia provinces.

Idlib is run by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a group dominated by Syria’s former Al-Qaeda affiliate.

Fighting there since Wednesday has killed 28 civilians including eight children, according to the Observatory.

It also took the lives of 58 pro-regime fighters and 67 fighters most of them jihadists, it added.

Violence in recent weeks has prompted hundreds of thousands of civilians to flee their homes, exposing them to a harsh winter.

On Thursday, Russia denied launching any combat operations in the region since the start of a ceasefire it said went into effect on January 9.

According to Turkey, the truce started on Sunday.

On Saturday, the Russian army deplored attacks led by HTS, describing them as “deliberate acts” designed to “undermine the ceasefire”, according to Russian news agencies.

Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he would discuss the latest attacks in northwestern Syria on Sunday with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.

75,2020/01/19,Chileans march against police repression of social unrest,"Hundreds of Chileans rallied Saturday night to protest what they call police repression during three months of the worst social unrest since democracy replaced the country's military dictatorship in 1990.

More than 1,000 people, many wearing black, marched in silence from Plaza Italia, ground zero of all the protests, along Alameda Avenue, the main thoroughfare in Chile's capital.

Keeping quiet was their way of denouncing the security forces' use of tear gas, water cannon and birdshot, although the latter was barred in November because it was causing many injuries.

""We are marching because of the human rights violations we have suffered. We will be here as long as is needed. This is the new Chile,"" said a social worker who gave her name only as Ana Maria.

The unrest broke out over a metro fare rise but quickly grew into a broader outcry against economic and social inequality in what had been considered among the most stable countries in Latin America.

A total of 29 have died in violence related to the protests and nearly 3,700 were injured -- more than 400 with eye injuries from the birdshot fired by police, according to the National Human Rights Institute.

The protesters on Saturday night got close to the La Moneda presidential palace.

76,2020/01/19,China reports 17 new cases of coronavirus strain,"China reported 17 new cases of the mysterious SARS-like virus on Sunday, including three in a severe condition, heightening fears ahead of China's Lunar New Year holiday when hundreds of millions of people move around the country.

The virus -- a new strain of coronavirus that humans can contract -- has caused alarm because of its connection to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

Of the 17 new cases in the central city of Wuhan -- believed to be the epicentre of the outbreak -- three are described as ""severe"".

The virus has now infected 62 people in Wuhan, city authorities said, with eight in a severe condition, 19 cured and discharged from hospital, and the rest remaining in isolation receiving treatment.

Two people have died so far from the virus, including a 69-year-old man who died on Wednesday, with the disease causing pulmonary tuberculosis and damage to multiple organ functions.

Authorities said they had begun ""optimized"" testing of pneumonia cases across the city to identify those infected with the virus, and would begin ""detection work... towards suspected cases in the city"" as a next step.

A paper published Friday by scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned that the number of cases in the city was likely to be closer to 1,700 than those officially identified.

Authorities said Sunday that some of the new cases had ""no history of contact"" with the seafood market believed to be the centre of the outbreak.

No human-to-human transmission has been confirmed so far, but Wuhan's health commission has previously said the possibility ""cannot be excluded"".

Three cases have also been reported overseas -- two in Thailand and one in Japan.

While mainland China has not yet announced any travel restrictions, authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up detection measures, including rigorous temperature checkpoints for inbound travellers from the Chinese mainland.

The US said from Friday it would begin screening direct flights arriving from Wuhan at San Francisco airport and New York's JFK, as well as Los Angeles, where many flights connect.

Thailand said it was already screening passengers arriving in Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Phuket and would soon introduce similar controls in the beach resort of Krabi.

Al Ekhbariya television quoted sources as saying the attack was carried out with ballistic missiles and drones.

A proxy war has been playing out in Yemen between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

78,2020/01/19,Facebook says technical error caused vulgar translation of Xi Jinping's name,"Facebook Inc on Saturday blamed a technical error for Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s name appearing as a slur in posts on its platform when translated into English from Burmese, apologising for any offence caused.

The error came to light on the second day of a visit by the president to the Southeast Asian country, where Xi and state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi signed dozens of agreements covering massive Beijing-backed infrastructure plans.

A statement about the visit published on Suu Kyi’s official Facebook page was littered with references to the slur when translated to English, while a headline in local news journal the Irrawaddy appeared with the vulgar translation.

It was not clear how long the issue lasted but Googles translation function did not show the same error.

“We fixed a technical issue that caused incorrect translations from Burmese to English on Facebook. This should not have happened and we are taking steps to ensure it doesn't happen again. We sincerely apologize for the offense this has caused,” Facebook said in a statement.

The Facebook system did not have President Xi Jinping's name in its Burmese database and guessed at the translation, the company said. Translation tests of similar words that start with ”xi” and “shi” in Burmese also produced the same translation, it added.

Facebook is blocked in mainland China. But it is not blocked in Hong Kong and mainland companies advertise elsewhere on the platform, making China Facebook’s biggest country for revenue after the United States. It is setting up a new engineering team to focus specifically on the lucrative Chinese advertising business.

Facebook has faced numerous problems with translation from Burmese in the past. In 2018 it temporarily removed the function after a Reuters report showed the tool was producing bizarre results.

An investigation documented how the company was failing in its efforts to combat vitriolic Burmese language posts about Myanmars Rohingya Muslims, some 730,000 of whom fled a military crackdown in 2017 that the U.N has said was conducted with genocidal intent.

It also showed the translation feature was flawed, citing an anti-Rohingya post advocating killing Muslims that was translated into English as ‘I shouldn’t have a rainbow in Myanmar.’",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yo9l5d/article30598744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THCHINA-12dec,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/facebook-says-technical-error-caused-vulgar-translation-of-xi-jinpings-name/article30598742.ece
79,2020/01/19,Trump’s legal team calls impeachment charges unlawful,"The White House legal team has slammed House Democrats’ impeachment effort against US President Donald Trump as “brazen and unlawful” in its first formal response.

“This is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election,” Xinhua quoted Trump’s lawyers as saying in a response filed to the US Senate on Saturday.

“The Articles of Impeachment are constitutionally invalid on their face,” the six-page response read.

Also on Saturday, House Democrats unveiled a 111—page outline of their legal case heading into the Trump impeachment trial in the Republican-majority Senate, underlying the central assertion that the US President abused his office, obstructed Congress and should be removed.

“The evidence overwhelmingly establishes that he is guilty of both. The only remaining question is whether the members of the Senate will accept and carry out the responsibility placed on them by the Framers of our Constitution and their constitutional Oaths,” the brief compiled by seven House managers read.

80,2020/01/19,Australian government to aid tourism industry as bushfires recede,"The Australian government said on Sunday it will channel A$76 million ($52 million) to the tourism industry as recent heavy rains have dampened many of the months long bushfires, allowing the country to look to recovery.

The number of fires burning across Australia's east and south coast has gone under 100 over the weekend for the first time in weeks, bringing relief from a disaster that has scorched an area roughly a third the size of Germany since September.

“Our federal response to these devastating bushfires is comprehensive and unprecedented,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison was cited in a statement announcing the aid.

Some 29 people and millions of animals have been killed so far in the burning bush in Australia - a country famous for its pristine beeches, abundant wildlife and open-air sporting events.

Australian Tourism Industry Council (ATIC), told Reuters earlier that damages to the tourism industry have approached A$1 billion.

The Australian Tourism Export Council, another peak tourism body, told the Australian Financial Review that the losses may go above A$4.5 billion by the end of the year.

Asked on ABC News television on Sunday whether A$76 million is sufficient, Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham said it was an initial package.

“There may need to be additional support and funding as we work through this recovery,” Mr. Birmingham said, according to a transcript of the interview.

Tourism has been an increasingly vital part of Australia's economy, accounting for more than 3 % of annual economic output.

Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, three of the states that are popular tourist destinations but which have been hit hard by the fires, are now dealing with rain bucketing down in some areas, causing floods and landslides.

Meteorologists expect more rain in Australia's east and south on Sunday and Monday, which should further help firefighters. As of Sunday, there were 69 bushfires in New South Wales, a third of them still yet to be contained.

Storms are expected to lash parts of Victoria, but there were still 14 fires burning on Sunday, with some big blazes in the state's mountain region known for hiking.

81,2020/01/19,Riots in Beirut leave more than 150 injured,"Police fired volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets in Lebanon’s capital Saturday to disperse thousands of protesters amid some of the worst rioting since demonstrations against the country’s ruling elite erupted three months ago. More than 150 people were injured.

Thick white smoke covered the downtown Beirut area near Parliament as police and protesters engaged in confrontations that saw groups of young men hurl stones and firecrackers at police who responded with water cannons and tear gas. Some protesters were seen vomiting on the street from inhaling the gas.

The violence began after some protesters started throwing stones at police deployed near the parliament building, while others removed street signs, metal barriers and branches of trees, tossing them at security forces.

The clashes took place with the backdrop of a rapidly worsening financial crisis and an ongoing impasse over the formation of a new government after the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned in late October.

Lebanon has witnessed three months of protests against the political elite who have ruled the country since the end of the 1975-90 civil war. The protesters blame politicians for widespread corruption and mismanagement in a country that has accumulated one of the largest debt ratios in the world.

The protesters had called for a demonstration Saturday afternoon with the theme “we will not pay the price” in reference to debt that stands at about $87 billion, or more than 150% of GDP.

As rioting took place in central Beirut, thousands of other protesters arrived later from three different parts of the city to join the demonstration. They were later dispersed and chased by police into nearby Martyrs Square that has been a center for protests.

Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces called on all peaceful protesters to “immediately leave the area of riots for their own safety.” It added that some policemen who were taken for treatment at hospitals were attacked by protesters inside the medical centers.

As clashes continued, some two dozen men believed to be parliament guards attacked the protesters’ tents in Martyrs Square, setting them on fire. A gas cylinder inside one of the tents blew up. The fire spread quickly and charred a nearby shop.

The bells of nearby St. George Cathedral began to toll in an apparent call for calm, while loudspeakers at the adjacent blue-domed Muhammad Al-Amin mosque called for night prayers.

Later in the evening, hundreds of protesters chanting “Revolution” chased a contingent of riot police near the entrance of the mosque, forcing them to withdraw. Inside the mosque, several men were treated for gas inhalation and some families were said to be hiding inside.

""We call on the security forces to be merciful with women and children inside the mosque,” a statement blared through the mosque’s loudspeakers.

President Michel Aoun called on security forces to protect peaceful protesters and work on restoring clam in downtown Beirut and to protect public and private propery. He asked the ministers of defense and interior and heads of security agencies to act.

""The confrontations, fires and acts of sabotage in central Beirut are crazy, suspicious and rejected. They threaten civil peace and warn of grave consequences,” tweeted Hariri, the caretaker prime minister, who lives nearb y. He called those behind the riots “outlaws” and called on police and armed forces to protect Beirut.

The Lebanese Red Cross said it took 65 people to hospitals and treated 100 others on the spot, calling on people to donate blood. As the clashes continued, more ambulances were seen rushing to the area and evacuating the injured.

Late on Saturday most of the protesters were forced out of the area by police firing tear gas and sometimes rubber bullets. Still, security remained tight as more reinforcements arrived.

Panic and anger have gripped the public as their local currency, pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, plummeted. The Lebanese pound lost more than 60% of its value in recent weeks on the black market. The economy has seen no growth and foreign inflows dried up in the already heavily indebted country that relies on imports for most of its basic goods.

Meanwhile, banks have imposed informal capital controls, limiting withdrawal of dollars and foreign transfers.

Earlier this week, protesters carried out acts of vandalism in a main commercial area in Beirut targeting mostly private banks.

82,2020/01/19,Yemeni officials: 25 troops killed in Houthi missile strike,"A missile attack launched by Shiite rebels in Yemen hit an army camp Saturday, killing at least 25 troops, Yemeni officials said.

The missile strike in the central province of Marib wounded around 10 others. Officials said they expected the death toll to rise as burn victims were rushed to hospitals.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorised to talk to the media.

The Houthi attack on the military training camp followed an ongoing barrage of assaults by Saudi-backed forces on rebel targets east of the capital, Sanaa.

Those attacks killed at least 22 people on both sides, according to officials.

Iran-backed Houthi rebels have remained in control of the capital, Sanaa, since ousting the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi in 2014.

The conflict became a proxy war months later, when a Saudi-led military coalition intervened to restore the internationally recognized government.

83,2020/01/19,"Harry, Meghan to drop titles, retire as working royals","Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle will no longer be working members of Britain's monarchy and they will pay their own way in life as they embark on an independent future, Buckingham Palace said on Saturday.

They will also no longer use their “Royal Highness” titles, the palace said in an announcement. The announcement sought to end turmoil sparked earlier this month when the couple announced they wanted to reduce their official duties and spend more time in North America. Prince Harry’s late mother Princess Diana lost the title as the Princess of Wales after her divorce from Prince Charles in 1996.

The Queen and family members had discussions with officials on how this stepping back would work in practice for Prince Harry, 35, and Ms. Markle, 38, former American actress. “Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,” Queen Elizabeth said in a statement issued by the palace, referring to the couple’s baby son.

“I recognise the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life.”

No royal events, tours

The Queen said she was “particularly proud” of how quickly Ms. Markle had become one of the family. The couple married in May 2018 in a lavish ceremony at her home in Windsor Castle, west of London in front of a global audience of millions.

Harry will remain a Prince and the couple will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they begin a new life split between North America and Britain, but they will not take part in any future ceremonial events or royal tours.

‘Kind words, firm line’

Royal commentators said it amounted to an “abdication” from the royal family and showed that under the warm words, the Queen had taken a firm and decisive line. “It is harder to think of a much cleaner break than this. Harry and Meghan are still members of the Royal Family, but they are effectively no longer royal”, the BBC's royal correspondent, Jonny Dymond, said.

Ms. Markle is currently in Canada with Archie and Prince Harry is expected to join her soon.

A palace spokeswoman said the couple would no longer receive public money and that they would repay the cost of refurbishing their cottage in Windsor, officially worth 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million). It remained unclear what public funds would be spent on their security. Buckingham Palace declined to comment but said there was an independent process to determine public funding for security.

The office of Canadian PM Justin Trudeau declined to comment on the news.

The couple's plans for independence, announced after a long break over the Christmas period in Canada, caught the rest of the royal family by surprise earlier this month and left the queen and other senior Windsors hurt and disappointed, according to royal sources.

However, in a TV interview aired in October, both had made it clear how they were struggling with the immense media attention. Harry said he felt his wife had faced “bullying” from some tabloids.

A friend of Harry and Meghan also said last week the couple felt they had been driven out by some members of the royal family.

The changes will come into effect in the spring of this year, the palace said, and there will be further royal engagements before the new arrangement is implemented, although it was not clear whether Meghan would be involved.

The situation will be reviewed in a year's time by senior royals - the queen, Harry's father and heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and Harry's elder brother Prince William.

There has been intense media speculation in recent days over what exact roles the couple would have.

“As agreed in this new arrangement they understand they are required to step back from royal duties,” the Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said on Saturday.

The change means Prince Harry, who served a decade in the British Army, will give up his military patronages and his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.

It was not immediately clear whether the couple could continue to use the “Sussex Royal” title for their website and branding.

While they will no longer receive public funding, Prince Charles will continue to offer private financial support, a royal source said.

The source said the couple will spend the majority of their time in North America, and had not signed any commercial agreements as yet.

“Although they can no longer formally represent the queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of her majesty,” the palace spokeswoman said.

Before their wedding, Harry's spokesman said that Meghan was seeking to become a British citizen, but rules specify that prospective Britons spend the vast majority of their time in the United Kingdom. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the issue.

“I think the queen has dealt with this crisis because she has absolutely drawn the line: you can be private people, but you cannot be royal at the same time,” Alastair Bruce, a commentator on the royals, told Sky News.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/az0czt/article30596946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Harrymeghan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/prince-harry-meghan-to-give-up-royal-highness-titles/article30596951.ece
84,2020/01/19,Russia’s Putin says he opposes unlimited presidential term,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Saturday that he opposes the idea of an unlimited term in office for the country’s leader like the system that existed in the Soviet Union.

Mr. Putin’s comment at a meeting with World War II veterans in St. Petersburg came days after he called for constitutional changes that could help him remain in power once his presidential term ends in 2024.

When a veteran at Saturday’s meeting proposed not having term limits for Russia’s President, Mr. Putin responded that “it would be very disturbing to return to the situation of the mid-1980s, with the leaders of the state, one by one, staying in power until the end of their days.”

There has been uncertainty about Russia’s future political course since Mr. Putin suggested in his Wednesday state-of-the-nation address amending the constitution to allow lawmakers to name prime ministers and Cabinet members.

The President currently holds the authority to make those appointments.

Observers speculated that after increasing the powers of Parliament and the Cabinet and curtailingPpresidential authority, Mr. Putin might repeat a strategy he used before to stay in charge — shifting into the Prime Minister’s seat.

Mr. Putin first became President in 2000, and moved to the Prime Minister’s office in 2008 when Constitutional limits prevented him from seeking a third term.

His chosen successor as President, Dmitry Medvedev, was widely seen as less influential than Mr. Putin.

Mr. Medvedev, who became Prime Minister after Mr. Putin returned to the presidency, submitted his resignation Wednesday after Mr. Putin outlined his constitutional proposals.

Rahmat Triyono, head of Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami center, said in a statement the inland earthquake did not have the potential to cause a tsunami, and urged people to stay away from slopes of soil or rocks that have the potential for landslides as people in some parts of Papua province felt a moderate tremor for a few seconds.

86,2020/01/19,The art and craft of writing,"“Its a very long academic novel called Indian Scotch, which I started writing in 2004,” says author and playwright Shreekumar Varma. It was when he was writer-in-residence at Stirling University, Scotland after having been awarded the Charles Wallace Fellowship, he recalls.

Side by side he wrote and completed plays, poetry and another novel Kipling’s Daughter (2018) all of which have been published. The Indian Scotch has been slow, “ Because I am not yet satisfied with what I have done.” But he is confident, he smiles, that it will get over some day adding that Kipling’s Daughter just took four months.

The story of Indian Scotch is about a girl who finds some of his belongings 10 years after he leaves Scotland, and who pieces together clues to find out what sort of a person he was and then traces her way back to him in India.

The grandson of the last ruling Maharani of Travancore, Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, and the great grandgrandson of artist Raja Ravi Varma, was in city to be part of a World Poetry Conference organised by the Cultural Centre of Vijayawada and Amaravati

Shreekumar has been a prolific writer and says he always loved the sound and feel of words. He remembers how his play The Dark Lord (1986) bagged second prize in the British Council South India Playwrights Competition and another play Bow of Rama won first prize in The Hindu All-India Playscripts Competition (1993). “I used to write anthologies and novels, Lament of Mohini (2000), Maria’s Room (2010) and Kipling’s Daughter (2018) kept coming one after the other,” he says.

Shreekumar loves writing for children. His books for the young ones include Devil’s Garden: Tales of Pappudom, published in 2006, The Magic Store of Nu-Chaam-Vu (2009) and Pazhassi Raja: The Royal Rebel (1997). Besides, a couple of anthologies Five and Other Plays and Midnight Hotel & Other Plays were published in 2019.

Being a direct descendent of the legendary Raja Ravi Varma, he is often asked if he paints too. “I am not yet good enough. One consolation is that Rabindranath Tagore discovered that he could paint at the age of 70 . So, I have time for it,” he chuckles. He says he has all the material on hand to ‘swing into action’.

He has however done the sketch of a woman on the cover of Kipling’s Daughter. “Art is like a violin. When you draw the bow across the violin strings you touch various points and various sounds come out, one of it could be music, one poetry, another fiction and yet another journalism as an art form. Art is like electricity, your creativity is going on all the time but to tap that, you need to switch on the light and that is when it starts flowing.”

Shreekumar says his being a private kind of a person has helped him observe better. “When I sit back and watch, I get to observe the silences. Silence is more important than words,” he says referring to one of his yet-to-be -named poem on the power of silence. “Even in music or in movies, the silence conveys so much more.”

Shreekumar confesses that he has always wanted to be involved with films. “Because cinema is something where all the mediums come together — fiction, music, art and everything else”.

Speaking about ‘artistic integrity’ he says, that it is very important. He remembers how after his novel Maria’s Room was published, he was asked to produce a ‘racy piece’. “I couldn’t. You don’t sit down and say today I am going to write a racy piece of work. It doesn’t work that way!” But he believes categorically that, “Whatever you write, if you do it well, it will always find takers.”",author,https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/137una/article30600395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BZ18MARIA2,https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/the-art-and-craft-of-writing/article30600397.ece
87,2020/01/19,Dewar and his special flask,"Cryogenics is a branch of physics that concerns itself with the production and behaviour of materials at very low temperatures. While the liquefaction of oxygen achieved by French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet and Swiss physicist Raoul Pictet in 1877 heralded the field, a lot of ground-breaking research in this area was done late in the 19th Century by British scientist James Dewar.

Born in 1842 in Kincardine, Scotland as the youngest of six boys, Dewar was orphaned by the time he turned 15. Nevertheless, he pursued his education, first at Dollar Academy and later at the University of Edinburgh.

By 1875, Dewar became a professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and two years later he was elected to the Royal Institution of Great Britain – positions that he held on to throughout his life.

Varied contributions

Dewar described several different structural formulas for benzene in 1867, published papers on a number of topics and also developed cordite, a smokeless gunpowder, in the 1880s along with English chemist Frederick Abel while serving on a government committee on explosives. His work on the spectroscopy of gases, including their behaviour at very low temperatures, began in 1878.

During one of his Friday evening lectures at the Royal Institution, Dewar demonstrated the apparatus employed by Cailletet to liquefy oxygen. Dewar dreamt of building on this and liquefy some of the other so called permanent gases.

Dreams come true

On June 5, 1885, Dewar was able to liquefy air. By 1991, he could produce liquid oxygen in large quantities. But he wasn’t satisfied as the lack of means to keep the gases cold long enough meant that they couldn’t be studied uninterrupted.

He solved this problem in 1892 when he conceived the idea of using vacuum-jacketed vessels to store low temperature liquid gases. He placed one glass vessel inside another, with double walls separated by a thin vacuum layer.

Dewar flask

This breakthrough allowed Dewar to continue his efforts. In a series of six Christmas lectures in 1893 and early 1894, Dewar liquefied air in the lecture hall for the audience and showed them that it could remain in liquid form if well-enclosed in a Dewar flask. In a meeting at the Royal Institution on January 19, 1894, Dewar successfully produced solid air.

Dewar, however, didn’t patent his flask and hence didn’t gain from it financially. Two German glass-blowers recognised its potential to store both hot and cold liquids, formed Thermos company, patented the idea and industrialised it. Dewar tried to sue them, but lost the court case.

Lifelong scientist

Dewar did have further scientific success though. Using a regenerative cooling machine that he built at the Royal Institution, he became the first to liquefy hydrogen. He kept improving his methods and wanted to become the first to remove the last remaining hurdle in liquefaction – that of helium.

That honour, however, went to Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who liquefied helium in 1908. When Onnes sent a telegram to convey to Dewar that he had converted helium to solid, Dewar was gracious in his reply.

Onnes received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1913 for his work, which also included his discovery of superconductivity in 1911. Dewar, who remained an active scientist until his death in 1923, never won the prize, despite being nominated several times. He did win many other prestigious honours and awards, and was knighted in 1904.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/kxopiw/article30521312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19istbJamesDewarjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/dewar-and-his-special-flask/article30521314.ece

89,2020/01/19,Rwandan national held for overstaying in Auroville,"The Auroville police have arrested a Rwandan national, Amani Pascal Peace John, for overstaying in the country.

The police learned of his overstay when he was picked up from Auroville on Friday for questioning in connection with a complaint filed by a woman residing near Chinna Mudaliar Chavady.

The woman had complained that the Rwandan national had raised a ruckus in her house on the eve of New Year.

According to the Auroville police, Mr. John had come to India to study in a private engineering college at Salem in 2010.

Though his visa expired, he continued to stay in the country, police said.

The Judicial Magistrate Court at Vanur remanded him in judicial custody.

The 12th such initiative of NYKS was aimed at providing the youth a platform to understand the diversity of the country in terms of culture, language, food and lifestyle.

Announcing the tour programme, Sub Collector (Revenue) Shashvat Saurabh told reporters that the programme was to expose the tribal youth to the technological and industrial advancement that the country had undergone and to sensitise them on various aspects of life. M. N. Nataraj, director, NYKS for Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, said the participants for the tour were selected by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Since, the tribal exchange programme was launched in 2006, around 38,000 tribal youths from the Naxal-affected districts in the country were taken to different parts of the country to sensitise them.

The youths showed behavioural changes for better after the tour programmes, he said, adding majority of the participants were school drop-outs. The team, during their travel and stay at the Youth hostel here, would be given security cover by police officers, including 20 CRPF personnel.

During their stay here, the team would be involved in various activities, including seminars, cultural programmes and industrial tour. Experts would deliver lecture on subjects such as “Indian democracy” and “Life and Teachings of Mahatma Gandhi”. They will also participate in a contest on the subject “Terrorism versus Development,” he said.

They would be also visiting Ponlait, an industrial unit at Mettupalayam, Auroville, Ashram, Beach and JIPMER.

“I had a very cordial and healthy meeting with DMK president M.K Stalin in Chennai today. Differences are sorted out and the alliance will continue for the next Assembly elections,” Chief Minister told The Hindu.

Mr. Narayanasamy said the alliance with the DMK was very strong and cannot be broken by anyone. “People have tried to break the alliance in the past too but they have not succeeded,” the Chief Minister said.

The growing strain in the relationship between the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee and DMK was a bit of a concern for the ruling Congress here as the government survived on the support of three DMK legislators.

92,2020/01/19,"At 83, love for learning burns bright","Subhadra, 83, is one step closer to her dream of clearing the Class 10 equivalency examination of the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority. On Saturday, she appeared for the Class 7 equivalency examination. Last month, she had sailed through the Class 4 exam.

In October last year, when she had cleared the first-level literacy examination, she had expressed her intention to clear the Class 10 exam.

Subhadra and her neighbour Vijayakumari were among the 16 people appearing for the Class 7 examination at Abraham Memorial Union Library, Thrikkannapuram, on Saturday.

Subhadra had some formal education, but soon dropped out, says Greeshma, her granddaughter, who has been supporting her endeavour all through. Now, Subhadra is making up for lost time. “Her enthusiasm is commendable,” class coordinator Mercy Thailet said.

Young teacher

Though she goes to her daughter-in-law and Aksharasree instructor Bindu to study, Greeshma, Bindu’s daughter, is the one she prefers to be with. “She likes Mathematics the most,” says Greeshma. Though Hindi was tough, she can now read and write in the language. At weekends, Subhadra rouses Greeshma at 5 a.m. to study. “She has her heart set on studies,” says Greeshma.

As many as 1,716 people took the Class 7 examination in the 10 wards of the city. While Subhadra was the oldest, the youngest was 22-year-old Hairunissa of Puthanpalli.

93,2020/01/19,10 persons fined for dumping garbage,"The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has imposed hefty fines on several people who were caught dumping garbage on the public roads.

The squad led by the health inspector of the civic body collected ₹15,550 as spot fine from 10 persons caught red-handed while dumping waste in various places under the Nanthancode health circle office, including Nanthancode, Pattom, Marappalam, Netaji Bose Road, T.K. Divakaran Road, Ambalamukku, and Kanaka Nagar.

The squad was led by health inspector S.S. Minu and junior health inspector Aji R. The littering was observed between 4 a.m. and 11 p.m.

The individuals had paid the fine and were issued receipts, the authorities said. The Corporation also slapped a fine of ₹2,000 on LIC, Pattom, for burning plastic waste.

The civic body has deployed staff in various locations for discouraging individuals and establishments from dumping garbage in public spots and waterbodies. The control room (Health) of the corporation is part of the effort. Health inspectors had been issued walkie-talkies as part of the exercise.

Kitchen bins

The Corporation had distributed kitchen bins for free to households and established common collection facilities for plastic and glass waste and used bags and footwear. Mayor K. Sreekumar urged the public to utilise these facilities and warned of stern action against people who dump garbage on roads and other public places.

Special squads will be formed under the zonal and health inspector offices of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation to apprehend litterbugs, the Mayor said.

94,2020/01/19,Tanker carrying untreated water seized,"The Health squad of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has come across yet another instance which amply justifies the civic body’s recent decision to tightly regulate tanker water supply by private operators.

The squad seized a lorry which was in the process of supplying untreated water to a restaurant at Statue. Apparently, the tanker operator had collected the water from a pond dug in a field at Thiruvallam. Following the incident, the Health squad instructed the restaurant to temporarily down shutters. According to the Corporation, the tanker belongs to AK Water Supply. The squad was led by health inspector Sujith Sudhakar and junior health inspector Saiju.

Tanker registration

The Corporation is collaborating with the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) for a major initiative to regulate tanker water supply and ensure availability of clean and safe water to the public. Under it, tankers used to supply water for both drinking and other purposes should be registered with the Corporation. Consumers can place their orders for tanker water via the Smart Trivandrum mobile app and web portal. Bookings can also be made through Akshaya centres and the call centres at the Corporation office. Payment of user fee for the services can be made online too. The Thiruvananthapuram Corporation had passed a bylaw on December 24 for regulating tanker supply.

Vending points

Treated water will be supplied through KWA vending points. The KWA will be responsible for ensuring water quality.

This service, managed by the corporation, will come into effect from February 1 and the civic body has launched the registration of the vehicles. Mayor K.

95,2020/01/19,Deepika Padukone draws social media ire,"Actor Deepika Padukone found herself at the centre of a social media storm after she was slammed for a TikTok video, where she challenges an influencer to recreate her acid attack survivor “look” from her latest film Chhapaak.

The TikTok challenge thrown by the 34-year-old actor was called “insensitive”, “crass” and the “worst kind of a promotion”.

39-second video

In a 39-second video that went viral on social media on Saturday, Ms. Padukone is seen asking make-up artiste Faby to recreate her “three favourite looks” from her films.

Faby recreated the actor’s looks from her 2007 debut Om Shanti Om and 2015’s Piku. However, her attempt at recreating the actor’s “look” from Chhapaak, in which Ms. Padukone plays Malti, an acid attack survivor, was criticised on social media.

Many called out the actor for trivialising the trauma of an acid attack survivor by categorising the part as a mere “look” and even questioned her intention behind taking up the part.

Another said, “This is really disrespectful to acid attack victims, @deepikapadukone. How disgustingly low are you going to stoop to promote yourself?”

“So ‘Acid Attacked Face’ has now become challenge now. This is the worst kind of a promotion by @deepikapadukone. Shame on you,” said one tweet.

Another user said that the actor, who has been vocal about mental health issues, should have been more careful. One post said the video was a “big mistake” on the actor’s part.

‘Normalise scars’

However, not everyone was critical of Deepika and a user said the actor was trying to make acid attack survivors a part of the society. “Deepika helping to normalise acid scars with Malti’s look being recreated. Social inclusion for acid attack survivors is important and the TikTok videos are a great way,” the user wrote.

Directed by Meghna Gulzar, the film is based on the life of acid attack survivor and activist Laxmi Agarwal.

98,2020/01/19,Aranthangi health district records nil maternal mortality in last two years,"The Aranthangi health district in Pudukkottai revenue district has achieved 100% safe deliveries without any maternal mortality over the past two years, thanks to improved obstetric care.

Describing it as a landmark in the State, T.S. Swathi Rethnavathi, Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, on Saturday called upon doctors to strive towards reducing the maternal mortality ratio (MMR).

Speaking at a continuing medical education programme on ‘Sustaining zero MMR’ organised by the Department of Medical and Rural Health Services and Family Welfare, Indian Medical Association and Federation of Obstetric & Gynaecological Societies of India, Pudukottai, Dr. Rethnavathi called for sustained efforts to bring down MMR in the State from the current 62 to 25 (for every one lakh live births). Virtual and real time mentoring system was adopted for better obstetric services in the State.

She urged government doctors to inform higher authorities about high risk mothers. Private doctors could also avail government facilities and service for better treatment. They should also undergo training periodically to update their knowledge and check leading causes of maternal mortality such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, postpartum hemorrhage, anaemia and sepsis.

M. Chandrasekharan, Joint Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, Pudukottai, said nil mortality for two years in Aranthangi health district was achieved by strengthening Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (CEMONC). Specialists from other parts of the district were posted to Aranthangi and 24-hour obstetric care was made available at Aranthangi Government Hospital, which handled up to 400 deliveries a month. During 2019, 10,950 deliveries took place at the Arangthangi health unit district without any maternal mortality.

The government had now deployed obstetrician mentors for primary health centres at every block. They would conduct monthly review of antenatal mothers to identify high-risk mothers and advice them proper follow-up treatment and care. The system had helped reduced MMR drastically in the district. All antenatal and post natal mothers were now under the Health Department’s tracking system, he said.

The government provided free transport for antenatal and postnatal visits, ₹18,000 for nutritional support, free Siddha lekiam for antenatal mothers and conducted yoga programmes for them to promote normal deliveries. People should utilise the support the government to help attain zero MMR, he added.

99,2020/01/19,Chelsea rocked as Hayden’s late strike lifts Newcastle,"Frank Lampard admitted he wants to sign a new striker after Newcastle damaged Chelsea’s bid for a top-four finish in the Premier League with a dramatic 1-0 win at St James’ Park on Saturday.

With Tottenham held by Watford earlier in the day, Chelsea would have cemented its grip on fourth place with a win on Tyneside.

But Lampard’s side was unable to muster the cutting edge required to break down a stubborn Newcastle and fell to Isaac Hayden’s header with just 20 seconds left in stoppage-time.

Chelsea’s first defeat in four league matches left it five points clear of fifth-placed United and Lampard is growing tired of his team’s struggles against defensive opponents.

“We know we have problems at the top of the pitch in terms of we don’t get enough goals. If you don’t score you are always liable for a sucker punch and they got it,” Lampard said.

“If we are looking for people to bring in to the areas to win games when you are controlling it, it is scoring goals.

“We can’t work anymore in training on finishing. You need to have that killer instinct in front of goal. We need to score more goals from front-line areas if we are going to get to where we want to be.

“It’s quite clear from what I am saying now that we know where we need to strengthen but we shall see.”

Wasted opportunity

After four league games without a victory, this was a much-needed success for Newcastle, but a wasted opportunity for Chelsea to open up a bigger gap in the race to qualify for the Champions League.

“We dominated every aspect of the game. The lads have got their heads down in there. But the brutal reality of football is if you don’t score, teams stay in the game and something like that happens at the end,” Lampard said.

“We have had more possession than any of our opponents in every game this season. It is a sign we have a lot of the ball but we are not scoring enough.”

Miguel Almiron opened up Chelsea down the right flank early on and Allan Saint-Maximin met the cross with a header that looped over.

Another casualty

Newcastle’s lengthy injury list gained another casualty inside 12 minutes when Jetro Willems was stretchered off after taking a knock in a challenge on Callum Hudson-Odoi.

Chelsea was dominating possession but Newcastle striker Joelinton, his confidence lifted by an FA Cup goal against Rochdale in midweek, went close to his first league goal since August when his powerful header cannoned back off the bar.

Reece James signed a new contract with Chelsea this week as a reward for his impressive breakthrough campaign and the young right-back gave a glimpse of his potential when his pin-point pass found N’Golo Kante for a shot that Martin Dubravka saved with his leg at the near post.

Chelsea remained vulnerable at the back and Federico Fernandez headed wastefully over from a Jonjo Shelvey free-kick.

Willian squandered a good opportunity from a Chelsea counter early in the second half when the Brazilian dragged wide from the edge of the area.

Chances at a premium

Chances were at a premium and Cesar Azpilicueta’s long-range effort lacked the power to beat Dubravka before Shelvey finally had Newcastle’s first shot on target in the 59th minute.

Chelsea’s frustration mounted when James limped off injured and moments later Tammy Abraham, teed up by Azpilicueta’s header, saw his effort turned away by Dubravka’s brave save.

Emerson fired just wide with an angled drive and in the fourth minute of stoppage-time Chelsea paid for their profligacy.

Saint-Maximin had space to whip in a teasing cross and Hayden got behind Antonio Rudiger for a close-range header that keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga could only push into the net.

The results:

EPL: On Sunday: Newcastle 1 (Isaac Hayden 90+4) bt Chelsea 0.

101,2020/01/19,Mohun Bagan has the last laugh in I-League’s first Kolkata Derby,"Mohun Bagan got the better of traditional rival East Bengal 2-1 in the first Kolkata derby of the I-League at the Salt Lake Stadium here on Sunday.

Watched by a capacity crowd of around 63,000, Bagan took a 2-0 lead, scoring once in each half before East Bengal launched a late fightback. However, it proved too little too late. Joseba Beitia and Baba Diawara found the target for Bagan while Marcos Espada netted for East Bengal.

Exciting session

An interesting first period saw Bagan hold the advantage, thanks for showing better coordination in its ranks. Diawara had a good opportunity in the 11th minute, but the Senegalese striker failed to send Beitia curling corner-kick into the net.

It was left to the young Nongdamba Naorem to open the goal route for Bagan six minutes later. The under-22 Bagan midfielder made his way past a couple of East Bengal defenders and set up the unmarked Beitia. The Spanish midfielder just had to nod the ball home into an open net.

Bagan had another chance in the 45th minute, but East Bengal goalkeeper Lalthuammawia Ralte cleared Diawara’s attempt with an acrobatic effort.

Looking for more

Bagan continued to push for more after the break and made it 2-0 in the 65th minute when Beitia’s corner-kick into the East Bengal goalmouth saw Diawara heading home.

With Bagan falling back into a defensive mould after the second strike, East Bengal took the opportunity to launch attacks. Though Espada pulled one back in the 71st minute, East Bengal failed to utilise the numerous chances that came its way in the final quarter.

The result: Mohun Bagan 2 (Joseba Beitia 17, Baba Diawara 65) bt East Bengal 1 (Marcos Espada 71).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/oyaadw/article30601559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20BAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/mohun-bagan-has-the-last-laugh-in-i-leagues-first-kolkata-derby/article30601560.ece
102,2020/01/19,Submitting claims undertwo super top-up policies,"Q. At present, super top-up policies are available with ₹20 lakh as the highest cover. Is it permitted for an individual to take two separate policies with two different service providers and submit claims on both, should medical expenses exceed ₹20 lakh?

N. KRISHNAMOORTHY

A. A super top-up policy comes into play once the sum insured (SI) under your basic policy for an entire policy year is exhausted. To begin with, you would have structured your super top-up policy threshold limit to match the SI under your basic policy.

You are exploring a need for a higher coverage than both these put together. If you take two super top-up policies from two different insurers, you may be able to claim under both the policies, but payment will be received only proportionately from each policy depending on the threshold and the SI of each. The limiting factor is that this is an indemnity policy and you can only make claims against bills.

An alternative could be the following, and this is hypothetical. In addition to looking at the maximum SI under your second super top-up policy, try for a threshold limit matching the combined SIs of your basic policy and the first super top-up policy. Then you can claim in sequence with higher coverage.

By the way, many companies offer higher SIs than what you mention on super top-ups and you should be able to shop around successfully.

Q. I have taken a term insurance policy. I am not into technical things about choosing term insurance. It is being initiated by an agent. Please advise whether I should continue with it or switch to any other option. Now, I am in the free-look period when I can return the policy. I am in a state of confusion; please help me.

PABITRA P. K.

A. Please talk to your agent and get them to explain the pros and cons of a term insurance policy which is pure insurance without any investment return or survival/ maturity benefit. Because of the same reason, it is the most cost-effective life insurance.

If these benefits are not what you need, you can make use of your free-look period (usually 15 days) and terminate the policy, getting a pre-decided part of your premium refunded.

After that process, please talk further to your agent and explore which other policy suits you best before making a final decision. This is a long-term investment and something that affects your financial planning for life, so it is worth investing in making a well-informed decision that you are confident about and can live with.

Please advise whether I can seek income tax exemption for such actual expenses incurred during the year.

V.R.S. Kumaraswamy

Those income tax assessees over the age of 60 (senior citizens) can claim expenses incurred by them for themselves and their dependent senior citizens only if there is no health insurance cover in the name of such assessee or their dependent senior citizens.

In your case, there is an insurance cover through your son’s employment benefits, hence deduction for medical expenses incurred in your case cannot be claimed as deduction. The income tax Act does not differentiate whether the policy is taken by the self or by any other person.

104,2020/01/19,Decent returns with a dash of safety,"Investors seeking fixed income and with a mild appetite for risk can consider Mahindra Finance’s fixed deposit schemes. The offerings include cumulative as well as non-cumulative options.

The cumulative option is where interest is calculated periodically and but paid at the time of maturity. The non-cumulative option allows for payment of interest at half-yearly, quarterly or monthly intervals.

Mahindra Finance’s fixed deposit offerings have a Crisil rating of ‘FAAA,’ which indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely payment of interest and principal is very strong.

Investors can choose from two primary channels: online investment through the company’s website www.mahindrafinance.com (the Dhanvruddhi scheme) and physically via the company’s branches (the Samrudhhi scheme).

The online channel offers interest rates ranging between 7.75% going up to 8.35%. Tenures range from 15 months to 40 months. Minimum amount for investment is ₹5,000 for the cumulative option.

Interest rates offered to senior citizens are 0.1 percentage points more for each option.

For the Samruddhi scheme, for which one has to submit application forms and make payments physically at the company’s branch offices, the interest rates range from 7.6% to 8.25% with tenures starting from 12 months going up to 60 months.

The Mahindra Group’s employees, retired staff and their relatives get an additional 0.35 percentage points on the interest rates while the minimum investment amount is ₹1,000. In this scheme, senior citizens get rates that are higher by 0.25 percentage points than the standard rates above, for the respective tenures.

Investors not looking for a regular income can opt for the 33-month cumulative option at 8.35%.

With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) having eased repo rates, it is true that interest rates are at a low and that with inflation having spiked recently, interest rates may rise. But the RBI is likely to pause and watch inflation movement before acting, as demand-supply has likely affected food prices. It remains to be seen if high inflation would persist once the effect of onion prices reduces over time.

Also, a less-than-three-year time frame would allow investors to look for re-investment opportunities, should the interest rate cycle turn by the time the deposit matures.

For the year ended March 2019, revenue from operations grew 31% to ₹8,722.91 crore, while profit after tax increased 44.7% to about ₹1,557 crore. As at end-September 2019, it had a healthy capital adequacy ratio of 19.7%. For loans outstanding and which have ageing of 90 days, the company has reported net non-performing assets ratio of 5.8%.

This company’s offerings are comparable to products on offer from companies with similar profiles.

105,2020/01/19,What happens when you don’t pay your life insurance premiums?,"There’s a famous quote by Khalil Gibran — “Forgetfulness is a form of freedom.” This quote might be a good fit in most circumstances but, when it comes to insurance, forgetfulness can work the other way around.

When you buy a life insurance policy, the insurance company’s obligation to pay out is contingent upon whether you have paid your premiums or not.

When does a policy lapse?

After you buy any kind of insurance, you have to pay a certain amount of premium every year till the term of the insurance ends. For some reason, if you are unable to pay the premium due even within the grace period provided by the insurer, your policy will be terminated.

It also depends on many factors, the most important being the type of insurance policy you own. In term insurance, failure to pay the premium before the due date results in the policy lapsing, which forfeits your insurance benefits and the premiums paid so far. In case of ULIP (unit-linked insurance plan), if you skip paying the premium in the first five years or during the lock-in period, the policy is considered lapsed. Your benefits move to a discontinuance fund and is payable only after the lock-in period.

In India, as per the guidelines set forth by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), all life insurance policies are legally required to honour a grace period, typically 30 days from the due date of payment. Insurance companies understand that the insured might not always be able to pay the premium every time before the due date. This is the reason that almost every insurance policy offers a grace period.

The policy is still in force during the grace period, and if anything happens to the insured, the nominee would still be eligible for the benefits. However, once the grace period is over, the policy is considered lapsed and the death benefit will not be paid. Grace period payments are almost always higher than standard premium payments.

Reinstating policy

If your life insurance cover lapses due to some unavoidable circumstances, it doesn’t have to be the end of the world. Many companies provide an option of reviving the lapsed policy within a specific time frame.

However, the process could be more expensive and involve another medical check-up and/or a penalty amount. Though the reinstatement of a lapsed policy could be different for different insurers and depends on the elapsed time, the product type and the insurance cost etc. a policyholder can apply for it.

Firstly, the insured will have to submit proof of continued insurability. These documents vary from insurer to insurer and also depend on the time elapsed. Secondly, revival can happen any time but the condition for revival might depend upon how long your policy has remained lapsed. As per insurance laws, if your policy has been in force for at least three years, insurers give you a window of two years to revive your policy by paying the due premiums and penalty interest that could be 12-18% of the total premium. But the more you delay reviving your policy, the more difficult it may get. However, if you revive within six months of its lapse, the restoration process is simple.

Lastly, if the insurance company sees fit, the insured might have to undergo a medical examination. Post the successful accomplishment of these conditions, the insurer decides if your policy is eligible to get reinstated or not.

New policy versus old

The premiums for term plan increase with age. For instance, Karan had bought term insurance at age 26, which covers him till 70, with an annual premium of ₹8,000. Due to financial problems, he paid the premium for only two years and let the policy lapse. He paid a total premium of ₹16,000 for the two years. Now, he has got only two options viz. either to buy a new policy or reinstate the current one. Let’s assume that he wants to review the policy after two years of the last premium paid. The insurer will charge him a renewal fee, late fee plus interest charges for the premiums due for the last two years. The total cost might add up to a total of ₹22,000-25,000.

Alternatively, if Karan, at the age of 30, plans to buy a new policy, it will cost him around ₹10,000 annually. If we calculate, by buying a new policy he is not only losing out on the premium he paid for the two years but also adding the cost to a new policy which is almost ₹2,000. This add-up cost will make a difference in the long run.

So, it’s always better to first try reinstating your policy if your insurer allows it. However, if you can’t reinstate, consider replacing the policy with a new one. The important thing is to ensure that you and your loved ones remain protected in case something bad happens to you.

Not having a life insurance plan, especially a term insurance plan, means your loved ones are not financially protected in the event of your death.

U.S. President Donald Trump, Britain’s Prince Charles, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Afghanistan’s Ashraf Ghani and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan would be among the world leaders attending the five-day 50th annual meeting of World Economic Forum (WEF) beginning Monday.

The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2020, to take place over January 20-24, will focus on establishing stakeholder capitalism as a way of addressing the world’s greatest challenges, from societal divisions created by income inequality and political polarization to the climate crisis we face today, the Geneva-based International organisation for public-private partnership said.

From India, besides Ms. Padukone over 100 CEOs as well as political leaders including Union and Chief Ministers will take part. Underpinning the meeting will be the Davos Manifesto 2020, a document that builds on the original Davos Manifesto of 1973, which set out for the first time the stakeholder concept that businesses should serve the interests of all society rather than simply their shareholders’.

The Davos Manifesto 2020 provides a vision for stakeholder capitalism that touches on a range of important issues of our time, including fair taxation, zero tolerance for corruption, executive pay and respect for human rights. “Business has now to fully embrace stakeholder capitalism, which means not only maximizing profits, but use their capabilities and resources in cooperation with governments and civil society to address the key issues of this decade. They have to actively contribute to a more cohesive and sustainable world,” said Klaus Schwab, WEF Founder and Executive Chairman.

Core areas of activity

This year’s programme focuses on achieving maximum impact on the forum’s platform for public-private cooperation across six core areas of activity: Ecology, Economy, Society, Industry, Technology and Geopolitics.

Among the initiatives to be launched at the Annual Meeting is one that aims to plant 1 trillion trees over the next decade and to equip 1 billion people with the necessary skills in the age of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Besides President Trump, Chancellor Merkel, Prince of Wales, President Ghani and Prime Minister Khan, top political leaders taking part include Han Zheng, Vice-Premier of the People’s Republic of China; Giuseppe Conte, Prime Minister of Italy; Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; Simonetta Sommaruga, President of the Swiss Confederation; Sebastian Kurz, Federal Chancellor of Austria and Ivan Duque, President of Colombia.

Leaders from civil society taking part in the meeting include Sharan Burrow, General Secretary, International Trade Union Confederation; Luca Visentini, General Secretary, European Trade Union Confederation; Micah White, Co-Creator, Occupy Wall Street; Kenneth Roth, Executive Director, Human Rights Watch; Jennifer Morgan, Executive Director, Greenpeace International; David Miliband, President, International Rescue Committee.

Participation of young leaders

This year over 120 of civic-minded young leaders will also join as members of the WEF Global Shapers, Young Global Leaders, and Social Entrepreneur communities. The WEF said it will also welcome 10 leaders under the age of 20 representing viewpoints of younger generations.

Adding a new dimension this year is the Arts and Culture Festival. Running alongside the Annual Meeting, the Festival will feature a number of sessions and immersive art installations, including those featuring the participation of the winners of the 26th Annual Crystal Awards and Cultural Leaders.

The WEF has said the 2020 meeting aims to give a concrete meaning to “stakeholder capitalism”, assist governments and international institutions in tracking progress towards the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals, and facilitate discussions on technology and trade governance.

A detailed manifesto will be released after January 26.

The card promises to make Delhi “pollution-free” and has fixed an aim to reduce air pollution by three times. It also promises to introduce “mohalla marshals” for women’s safety.

The card also promises 11,000 buses and to increase Metro train lines to over 500 km.

“This is my guarantee to people of Delhi for the next five years. The manifesto will be launched later and it will have more things specific for students, teachers among others. This will be for everyone,” he said.

“Opposition is saying many of our schemes will be only till March 31, so this is our guarantee that these schemes will continue for the next five years,” he added. “24 hour electricity will continue. 200 units of free electricity will continue,” he said.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/51pzvn/article30599276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kejriwaljfif,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/delhi-assembly-elections-2020-kejriwal-ka-guarantee-card-promises-pollution-free-city/article30599274.ece
108,2020/01/19,"Kejriwal’s subdued response to CAA-NPR-NRC, Jamia-JNU violence smacks of opportunism: Kapil Sibal","Asserting that the uproar over the amended citizenship law and the Jamia-JNU violence will be a major factor in the Delhi Assembly polls, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Sunday said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s “subdued” response to the issues “smacks of opportunism“.

He also said the Congress will play a “significant” role in the polls and exuded confidence that the party could get enough seats to emerge as the “determining factor” in government formation.

“He (Kejriwal) did not show up in Jamia (Millia Islamia), he did not show up in JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University). His statements were not frequent enough, strong enough and open enough,” Mr. Sibal told PTI in an interview.

He said Mr. Kejriwal’s somewhat “subdued” response to what has been happening around has not sent the right kind of signals.

“It smacks of opportunism,” said the Rajya Sabha MP, who is a member of the Congress’ election and campaign committees for the Delhi polls.

Asked if the massive uproar over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the violence on university campuses will be a major factor in the polls, Sibal replied in the affirmative.

“What has Kejriwal done? Kejriwal has not even visited the campuses, not even visited JNU, because this is politics,” he said.

“This is the problem when political parties take positions only for the purpose of an election, not for the purpose of what is right. People see through their acts,” the former Union minister said.

Mr. Sibal also alleged that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was not talking much about CAA, NPR and NRC for the fear of losing a section of a vote bank that it “desperately needs“.

He asserted that Mr. Kejriwal has to answer to the people for his response to CAA, NPR and NRC.

Asked if the Congress can form the government on its own, Mr. Sibal said, “I don’t think that we should be making such tall claims, but at the same time I think we will be a significant factor in this election... maybe giving us enough seats to be the determining factor in the formation of the government.”

On whether the Congress can join hands with the AAP if it turns out to be the “determining factor”, he said, “Let us first get the results out in the open. What our strategy is will be known to everybody at that point in time.”

Mr. Sibal also dismissed suggestions that the Congress’ chances in the polls may be hampered by the absence of a popular and credible face, saying the credibility of a face has no relationship to the party’s credibility in terms of its functioning on the ground.

“In 2014, we had a credible face in (Narendra) Modi ji, that is what the people of India thought, see what has happened since then. So let us not talk about the faces. The face of the common man is far more important than the face of the chief minister,” he asserted.

It is only the Congress party that has always looked at the face of the common man or woman and worked towards his or her concerns, said Sibal, who has been elected to the Lok Sabha twice in the past from Delhi’s Chandni Chowk constituency.

Responding to a question about the Congress mounting a formidable challenge to the AAP, Mr. Sibal said his party does not have any seats in the Delhi Assembly, so the ruling party certainly has an advantage.

“I think they (AAP) claim more than what they have done on the ground. They have a fabulous media campaign. This is somewhat like our prime minister’s media campaign which sort of tries to claim much more than what the reality is. I think the people know the reality. So let’s see what happens,” he said.

The Congress leader claimed that the BJP is on a sticky wicket in the polls as it has “lost credibility” and people are very unhappy with it.

He cited the examples of Maharashtra and Haryana assembly elections, in which the poll pundits were proved wrong, to stress that a surprise could be in the offing in Delhi and his party could deliver a strong performance in the polls.

“I think the people of Delhi, as a member Parliament and (someone) who has fought elections in Delhi I can say, have realised that it is the Congress party that has delivered in Delhi. There is no other party that has delivered in Delhi. As far as AAP is concerned, it has been in constant conflict with the Centre,” Mr. Sibal said.

“I remember the days when Sheila (Dikshit) ji was the chief minister and (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee ji was the prime minister. Even though we were different political parties with different ideologies, the administration worked together,” he said.

This talks well of Vajpayee’s administration and Dikshit’s quality to embrace everyone and get the work of the people of Delhi going, he said, adding that, Mr. Kejriwal doesn’t have that art.

“In a constant state of conflict, I don’t think you can achieve much. I want to know how many great bridges have been built, how many underpasses have been built (under the AAP government). There is no infrastructure development at all,” Mr. Sibal alleged.

All the schemes that have been taken forward in Delhi have been the brainchild of the Congress, he said.

Polling will be held on February 8 for the 70-member Delhi Assembly and the results will be declared on February 11.

109,2020/01/19,Repatriated Brus in Mizoram demand package parity,"A resettlement decision taken on January 16 to end the 22-year-old issue of the displaced Bru tribal people has triggered resentment among those who had accepted the earlier rehabilitation package and returned to Mizoram from where they had been displaced.

In 1997, more than 40,000 Brus had fled ethnic violence in Mizoram and taken shelter in the Kanchanpur sub-division of the adjoining State of Tripura. Some of them returned to Mizoram after accepting rehabilitation packages in the nine phases of repatriation till 2018.

But the latest agreement allowing the Brus, who refused to vacate the relief camps, to permanently settle in Tripura has made those who returned to Mizoram feel discriminated against.

The quadripartite agreement signed by the Centre, the governments of Tripura and Mizoram and various Bru refugee organisations entail a housing plot in Tripura for each displaced family in addition to ₹4 lakh as a fixed deposit, ₹5,000 per month for two years, free rations for two years and ₹1.5 lakh to build houses.

“The new agreement would not make any Bru family want to go to Tripura because we feel safe here. But there is disparity between the package offered to Brus repatriated to Mizoram and those who would be permanently settled in Tripura after refusing to be repatriated,” said Elvis Chorkhy, chairman of the Bru Coordination Committee, representing the Brus of Mizoram.

The government, he said, should ensure that the repatriated Bru families receive a rehabilitation package equivalent to the one for settlement in Tripura.

Mr. Chorkhy said that each of the 6,000 repatriated Brus received ₹80,000 on their return to Mizoram and were entitled to free rations for a year.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/5n8flt/article30601829.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BRU-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/repatriated-brus-in-mizoram-demand-package-parity/article30601646.ece
110,2020/01/19,BJP accuses AAP govt. of trying to save Nirbhaya convicts,"The BJP on Sunday attacked the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi for allegedly delaying justice in the Nirbhaya case and trying to shield the convicts in the 2012 rape and murder of a 23-year-old from the death penalty.

At a press conference at the BJP headquarters here, the national president of the party’s women’s wing and Rajya Sabha MP Saroj Pandey said lawyer Indira Jaising had appealed to the victim’s mother to forgive the convicts, who are on death row. Ms. Pandey said Ms. Jaising had been “connected with the AAP” and should have “thought not one once, but a 1,000 times before making such a statement”.

Delhi BJP president and north east Delhi MP Manoj Tiwari added that the Delhi government’s responsibility was to inform the convicts of their punishment when it was handed out by court in July 2017. He said the government only informed the convicts after two years, delaying the process of them filing mercy petitions.

“The Deputy Chief Minister [Manish Sisodia] says they don’t have the police under them so they couldn’t do it. But the prison department is with the State government, in Delhi also. It has nothing to do with the police,” he said.

Delhi BJP vice-president Shazia Ilmi, who had been a member of the AAP before joining the BJP in 2015, said Ms. Jaising had been “close to the AAP” and represented the Delhi government in the court. She asked how the AAP government was able to amend the jail manual two years ago if it did not have jurisdiction over prisons.

Mr. Sisodia had said on January 16: “The BJP-led government and the Home Ministry directs and controls the police and is responsible for the law and order in Delhi and for administration of Tihar Jail. The director-general of Tihar reports to you and then you blame us for the delay?”

He added: “Bring the Delhi police under our jurisdiction for two days, we will ensure execution of Nirbhaya’s culprits.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/3rwh6w/article30601792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-SAROJPANDEY-SANDEEPSAXENA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-accuses-aap-govt-of-trying-to-save-nirbhaya-convicts/article30601706.ece
111,2020/01/19,Freedom is best secured by citizens: Manmohan,"Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday said institutions of our democracy have been put to test on several occasions but in recent times young people have shown that freedom is best secured by enlightened citizens.

Dr. Singh made these remarks at the formal launch of former Law Minister Dr. Ashwani Kumar’s latest book, Human Dignity – A purpose in perpetuity.

“In recent days, young people across the country have reminded us that freedom is best secured in the custody of enlightened citizens and when it is protected for all. The institutions of liberal and libertarian democracy have been put to test on several occasions when fundamental freedoms were threatened. These institutions, nurtured over the years, need to be strengthened and must assert themselves in defence of the Constitution. This is an important message of the author who has spent a lifetime in the study and practice of law,” Dr. Singh said.

“Indeed the idea of freedom can acquire shape and form in the lives of our people only if they can live as equal citizens under the law,” said Dr. Singh.

Former President Pranab Mukherjee was scheduled to release the book at the India International Centre but he could not attend as he was not well.

Author Kumar said somewhere along the line, the institutional response to challenging situations has been found wanting.

“In the pages of this book, I have endeavoured to articulate the aberrations that have slowed our march towards the realization of human dignity in the hope that a purposive reflection thereon will assist to remedy the situation in these times of change and challenge,” the author added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vki2go/article30601699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20MANMOHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/freedom-is-best-secured-by-citizens-manmohan/article30601700.ece
112,2020/01/19,States can’t be forced on Citizenship Amendment Act: Congress,"Amid conflicting statements by its senior leaders over Assemblies adopting resolutions against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the Congress on Sunday said the States had the right to disagree with the Centre.

“Let the BJP government and its Governors not forget that India is a Union of States. As per the established parliamentary practice, States can disagree with the Union and challenge the same by way of their Constitutional right under Article 131 of the Constitution,” Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala said in a statement.

Cites precedent

“In the past, many States such as Karnataka, Bihar, Rajasthan, just to name a few, have approached the Supreme Court under Article 131 to resolve disputes with the Union of India on a range of issues. Until the issue is resolved on a petition moved under Article 131, States cannot be forced to implement an unconstitutional law like the CAA,” he added.

The people’s movement against the CAA shall go on “courageously and fearlessly” as citizens, parties and States shall continue to oppose the CAA with determination, the Congress chief spokesperson said.

“Repeated statements being made by the Home Minister and BJP-appointed Governors and forcing the States to implement the CAA are itself preposterous and go against the very concept of constitutional federalism,” Mr. Surjewala said.

The party’s strong articulation came after former Law Minister Kapil Sibal on Saturday had said in Kerala that the States could not refuse to implement the CAA after Parliament had passed it.

But the Congress leader “clarified” his position on Sunday.

“I believe the CAA is unconstitutional. Every State Assembly has the constitutional right to pass a resolution and seek its withdrawal. When and if the law is declared to be constitutional by the Supreme Court then it will be problematic to oppose it. The fight must go on!” Mr. Sibal said in a tweet.

Senior Congress leader Salman Khursid echoed his views, while speaking to the news agency ANI.

“If the Supreme Court doesn’t interfere, it will remain on the statute book. If something is on the statute book, you have to obey the law, else there are consequences,” Mr. Khurshid was quoted as saying.

Former Minister Jairam Ramesh too had described States opposing the CAA as a tricky business as citizenship is a Central subject.

The Congress reiterated that the CAA was a diversionary tactic from issues such unemployment, and cited the latest National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data that said 26,085 people committed suicide because of joblessness.

We request the Prime Minister with folded hands to attend these issues, which are of life and death,” Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said at a press conference.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dae6yk/article30555812.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13SURJEWALA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/states-cant-be-forced-on-citizenship-amendment-act-congress/article30601727.ece
113,2020/01/19,"India successfully test-fires 3,500-km range submarine-launched ballistic missile K-4","India on Sunday successfully test-fired the 3,500-km range submarine-launched ballistic missile, K-4, official sources confirmed. The test was carried out by the Defence Research and Development Organsiation (DRDO) from a submerged pontoon off the Visakhapatnam coast around noon.

“The test was conducted from a submerged pontoon and has met the desired parameters. A pontoon simulates the situation of a launch from a submarine,” an official source said on condition on anonymity.

The missile has been tested several times earlier as part of developmental trials to validate different parameters, the source said. “The missile ejecting from a submerged platform to the surface [sea] is the toughest part.”

There are very few countries which have managed to achieve this technological breakthrough, a second official source said. “Our Circular Error Probability (CEP) is much more sophisticated than Chinese missiles,” the source said. The CEP determines the accuracy of a missile. The lower the CEP, the more accurate the missile is.

Once inducted, these missiles will be the mainstay of the Arihant class of indigenous ballistic missile nuclear submarines (SSBN) and will give India the stand off capability to launch nuclear weapons submerged in Indian waters. INS Arihant, the first and only operational SSBN, is armed with K-15 Sagarika missiles with a range of 750 km.

This means the submarine has to venture far way from the Indian waters and move closer to the adversary’s coast to launch the missile. The K-4 will do away with that need.

In November 2019, India formally declared its nuclear triad stated in its nuclear doctrine operational after INS Arihant completed its first deterrence patrol which means Arihant has begun prowling the deep seas carrying ballistic missiles equipped with nuclear warheads. As reported by The Hindu earlier, it was quietly commissioned into service in August 2016 and its induction was not officially acknowledged. It has a displacement of 6,000 tonnes and is powered by an 83 MW pressurised light-water reactor with enriched uranium.

Given India’s position of ‘No-First-Use’ (NFU) in launching nuclear weapons, the SSBN is the most dependable platform for a second-strike. Because they are powered by nuclear reactors, these submarines can stay underwater indefinitely without the adversary detecting it. The other two platforms — land based and air launched are far easier to detect.

The Advanced Technology Project (ATV) began in the 1980s and the first of them, Arihant, was launched in 2009 by then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Since then it underwent extensive sea trials and the reactor on board went critical in 2013.

In 1998, India conducted nuclear tests under Phokran-II and in 2003, declared its nuclear doctrine based on credible minimum deterrence and an NFU policy while reserving the right of massive retaliation if struck with nuclear weapons first.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/nri88z/article12238785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DRDO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-successfully-test-fires-3500-km-k-4-slbm/article30601739.ece
114,2020/01/19,Five crore link Bihar human chain,"Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, along with his deputy, Sushil Kumar Modi, and his Cabinet colleagues, participated in an 18,034-km human chain in the State organised on Sunday to make people aware of climate change, prohibition and social ills such as dowry and child marriage.

Mr. Nitish Kumar, Mr. Modi and Rajendra Singh, known as the “waterman of India”, linked hands in Patna’s historic Gandhi Maidan from 11.30 a.m. to noon to mark the occasion. Senior government officials too were present in the ground from where the human chain branched out from four corners to other districts.

Teacher dead

However, the death of Mohammad Daud, a schoolteacher, while participating in the event at Keoti block in Darbhanga district, cast a shadow on the event.

State government officials, teachers, students, Anganwadi workers and Asha workers were asked to form the human chain to make it a “mega success.”

Later, expressing happiness over the successful completion of the campaign, the Chief Minister tweeted to thank the people of Bihar for their “unprecedented support” to make the human chain, in which 5,16,71,389 people participated, a milestone.

Leaders and workers from ruling alliance partners, the BJP and Lok Janshakti Party, too participated in the human chain in their respective districts and areas. However, Opposition parties slammed Mr. Kumar for “wasting a huge amount of money for his publicity.”

Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar told the media that altogether 7 helicopters and over 100 drones were used for photographing the human chain in several districts.

“Some helicopters in some districts didn’t fly because of inclement weather”, he added. Asked about the total expenses incurred for organising the event, he said, ₹15-16 crore was spent on the whole awareness campaign.” The Opposition parties alleged that not less than ₹200 crore was spent on hiring copters, drones, planes and professional photographers from Mumbai to record the event and make it a “world record.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w3e60l/article30601667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20NITISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/five-crore-link-bihar-human-chain/article30601669.ece
115,2020/01/19,Centre for tougher law against sexual harassment at work,"The Group of Ministers (GoM) headed by Home Minister Amit Shah, which was constituted to strengthen the legal framework to prevent sexual harassment at the workplace, has finalised its recommendations, a senior official said.

The recommendations, which include addition of new provisions to the Indian Penal Code, will be put up for comments from the public, the official said.

The GoM was constituted first in October 2018 in the aftermath of the #MeToo movement after many women shared their ordeal on social media. It was reconstituted in July 2019 under Mr. Shah.

The other members of the GoM are Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Human Resource and Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani.

IPC overhaul

Another official said changes to the existing laws on sexual harassment at the workplace would be incorporated when the overhaul of the IPC was complete. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is working on another project to reboot the IPC, introduced by the British in 1860.

Several retired judges, legal luminaries and State governments are being consulted by the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) to amend various sections of the IPC and the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr. PC).

“When changes are made to the IPC, the sections on crime against women will also be amended. The laws need to change with time, and sexual harassment of women at the workplace will be addressed through the IPC amendments also,” the official said.

The Women and Child Development Ministry had steered the Sexual Harassment of Women and Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act in 2013, which was applicable to government offices, the private sector, NGOs and the unorganised sector.

The official said the proposed amendments would be largely based on the Vishaka Guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in 1997, on which the 2013 Act was based. It made the employer responsible to prevent or deter acts of sexual harassment at the workplace. The 2013 Act had shortcomings like giving the powers of a civil court to the internal complaints committee (ICC) without specifying if the members need to have a legal background. It only imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on employers for non-compliance. The Act said the employer shall provide assistance to the woman if she chooses to file a complaint under the IPC “against the perpetrator after the conclusion of the enquiry”.

The GoM also examined the report of the Justice J.S. Verma Committee that was constituted in the wake of the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder in 2012. The Verma committee had recommended an employment tribunal, instead of an ICC, as dealing with such complaints in-house could discourage women from coming out.

As per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) the number of sexual harassment incidents at “work or office premises” registered under Section 509 IPC (words, gesture or act to insult the modesty of a woman) were 479 and 401 in the years 2017 and 2018 respectively. Among the cities, the highest number of such cases were registered in Delhi (28), Bengaluru (20), Pune (12) and Mumbai (12) in 2018. The total number of sexual harassment incidents in 2018 including that in public places, shelter homes and others was 20,962.

The MHA in December 2018 had written to all States to ensure that the ICC under the 2013 Act was constituted and notified to the police departments.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jxcojm/article30601585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Workplace-harassment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-for-tougher-law-against-sexual-harassment-at-work/article30601660.ece
116,2020/01/19,Multi-State police action nets 12 terror suspects,"In a coordinated, covert operation, special teams of the Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra police, guided by Central intelligence agencies, neutralised alleged sleeper cells across the country and averted a plot to unleash terror in major cities.

Police sources said since provisions under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act were invoked and the terror module had spread to more than four States, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) would investigate the case.

The Tamil Nadu police have already sent a report to the Union Home Ministry in this regard.

At least a dozen suspects, hand-picked from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and trained to carry out attacks on individuals and vital establishments, were arrested in Delhi, Bengaluru, Udupi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, sources in the intelligence agencies told The Hindu on Sunday.

Special teams of the ‘Q’ Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police were working with different State police forces to apprehend a few more suspects who have gone underground after their module was busted and accomplices were taken into custody, the sources said.

Foreign handler

According to officials, the two modules comprising at least a dozen or more youth indoctrinated with a jihadi ideology and prepared to launch fidayeen (suicide) attacks, were reporting to a foreign handler.

Parrying questions on the nationality of the handler and how he managed to form sleeper cells in India, Deputy Inspector-General of Police N. Kannan said it was too early to share details since the operation was still on.

“We can only say that a major sabotage plan targeting individuals and institutions has been successfully averted. Acting on timely and specific intelligence shared by the Tamil Nadu police, Central intelligence agencies worked with the Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, and West Bengal police forces in zeroing in on the sleeper cells,” he said.

The ‘Q’ Branch CID police on Saturday arrested Hussain Sherif of Bengaluru, who provided shelter to Shameem and Thoufic, the assailants who shot dead special sub-inspector Wilson in Kanyakumari district recently.

Digital trail erased

“The suspect has managed to erase some material evidence connected to the case which we are trying to retrieve. The mysterious absence of three accused persons in a sensational murder case and the way they systematically erased their digital footprint and trail gave a clear indication that they were planning something big,” Mr. Kannan said.

“Hussain Sherif was running a front organisation, Al Hind Trust, in Bengaluru to carry out charity activities though his hidden agenda was to pursue jihad,” the police officer said.

Meanwhile, police sources said a couple of gangs were arrested as they were waiting to receive “consignments” from undisclosed locations.

Tamil Nadu Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy reviewed the security arrangements and further course of action with senior police officials.

Senior investigators said they analysed about 500 SIM card communications to narrow down on a dozen numbers that had suspicious call detail record.

“These numbers only consumed data and had no calls. All the cards were activated in the Salem area in Tamil Nadu but were active in Karnataka,” a police officer said.

“The documents used to activate these SIM cards were genuine, though the original subscribers had no contact with the suspects and they had their own numbers. Enquiries are on with the retail SIM sellers who seem to have activated fresh numbers on the basis of documents submitted by other customers,” he said.

While the source of three country-made weapons and 89 rounds of ammunition seized from suspects arrested in the past two weeks is under investigation, the official said, more information on the contacts of the accused persons will be known after analysing their mobile phones and storage devices that have been referred to cyberforensic experts.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/6gtii0/article30581987.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA17TVLACCUSED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/special-police-teams-nia-bust-terror-plot/article30601635.ece
117,2020/01/19,Fishing boats collide at sea,"Eighteen fishermen had a narrow escape at sea when two fishing boats collided due to poor visibility caused by dense fog near Odisha’s Gopalpur on Sunday morning.

Four were injured but all of them swam ashore. Later other fishermen from the coast salvaged the damaged fishing boats. The collision was so heavy that one boat was ripped into two and only one of its portions could be retrieved.

One boat was returning to shore with its fish catch, while the other was venturing into the sea for fishing. Driver and crew of both boats failed to notice the other boat in the fog. All of a sudden they had head-on collision.

The fish-laden boat was the one completely wrecked and its catch and nets were sunk. The fishermen jumped out in time and the uninjured fishermen helped their four injured comrades to reach the shore.

118,2020/01/19,Royal Navy chief pushes for cooperation between U.K. and India,"Observing that both India and the U.K. are working on aircraft carriers, fifth generation fighter aircraft and integrated electric propulsion, Admiral Tony Radakin, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, U.K., said it feels “immensely comfortable and strategically sensible that we should be looking to converge and come together”.

There are amazing sets of investments going on in the Indian military, Adm Radakin said, which is aircraft carriers, submarines and thinking about integrated electric propulsion and the Royal Navy is going through its own significant recapitalisation, growing for the first time in 70 years. We will grow in tonnage terms by 30% in size between 2015 and 2025. And while five years ago the U.K. had no aircraft carriers, “We now have two,” he said.

“When you marry that with a nation like India and the journey that it is on, it is immensely comfortable and strategically sensible that we should be looking to converge and come together. Those are the conversations we are having and they are exciting…,” he told The Hindu on the sidelines of the Raisina Dialogue last week jointly organised by the Ministry of External Affairs and the Observer Research Foundation.

On this, the Royal Navy chief laid particular emphasis on cooperation on aircraft carriers and discussions on electric propulsion. He said there is clarity for most navies that are seeking to modernise and to embrace technology that electric propulsion “is the way to go” and it then starts to open up opportunities with directed energy weapons. “The U.K. position is that we have very clear, shared values and responsibilities and ambitions and therefore we would look to collaborate with India as a friend.”

The U.K.’s renewed focus on the Indo-Pacific comes as the country prepares to leave the European Union (E.U.). Referring to this, Adm. Radakin said as part of the U.K.’s long presence in the Indian Ocean and in conjunction with that, the ability of the U.K. to be “both taking stock as it leaves the EU and the clarity of the government that this is not retrenching the world. If anything there is a need for us to emphasis our broader role in the rest of the world”.

Elaborating on the common interests, he said both countries have such a reliance on the energy that flows through the Strait of Hormuz. “We shouldn’t get too fixated by individual security constructs. I think at this stage we should be confident that we have the ability to work together to share information that we both have the same shared interests and values, and that enhances mutually our own security.”

Referring to the Indian Navy’s Information Fusion Centre for Indian Ocean Region (IFC-IOR), Adm. Radakin said fusion centres are an example of collaboration at a tactical level “but really a strategic operational level signalling of where countries come together”.

The U.K. has already accepted India’s offer to post a Liaison Officer at the IFC-IOR which is likely to happen sometime next year. Also the Queen Elizabeth Carrier Strike Group is scheduled to undertake its maiden operational deployment in the Indian Ocean Region in 2021.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5obm71/article30601326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20-Radakin-Tony-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/royal-navy-chief-pushes-for-cooperation-between-uk-and-india/article30601327.ece
119,2020/01/19,"All Afghans have been persecuted, says Hamid Karzai","India should treat all Afghans equally, former Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai said, taking exception to the stipulation in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, that only Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis from that country would be eligible for fast-tracked naturalisation in India.

“We don’t have persecuted minorities in Afghanistan… the whole country is persecuted. We have been in war and conflict for a long time. All religions in Afghanistan — Muslims and Hindus and Sikhs — which are our three main religions, have suffered,” Mr. Karzai said. He was speaking exclusively to The Hindu during a visit to Delhi where he addressed the inaugural session of the government’s Raisina Dialogue.

Mr. Karzai said he hoped the sentiment that minorities must be protected “would be reflected in India with regard to other Afghans, who are Muslim, as well.”

Mr. Karzai’s comments, differing from New Delhi’s view are significant, given that he has been seen as a strong friend of India. Like many Afghan leaders, Mr. Karzai has also lived in India for several years beginning in 1976, and has studied in Shimla.

In December, the MEA had clarified that the CAA referred to past attacks against minorities in Afghanistan and that the current government had “substantially addressed the concerns of the minority communities as per their constitutional provisions.”

Full text of the interview:

What sort of impact do you expect on Afghanistan from heightened U.S.-Iran tensions?

Any development positive or negative in Iran has a deep impact on Afghanistan. Without a doubt, heightened tensions with the U.S. will have an impact on Afghanistan. We very much wish that Iran be wise and cognisant of the fact that the U.S. presence in Afghanistan should not be seen as a threat to them, and we ask the Americans not to do anything that would precipitate any situation with Iran.

At the Raisina Dialogue, you said Iran and also Pakistan are the two countries that have the highest impact on Afghanistan today…

These are our two most significant neighbours. Both have together welcomed millions of Afghan refugees, about two to three million each. The peace process [with the Taliban] that has started, is definitely linked to their assistance and goodwill towards us, and vice-versa. So Pakistan has a lot of impact on us.

India is not part of the talks with the Taliban, nor has it agreed to increase its military footprint there. What do you see as India’s strategic role in Afghanistan?

During my government (2001-2014), we had made a decision that India would be our most important friend and ally for strategic and historical reasons. India did what it could. Although it was not traditionally a donor country, it showed exceptional generosity in giving us almost $3 billion in assistance, and we are grateful for that. At the same time, we have seen that India is not keen to support the U.S.-launched peace process or our own Afghan peace process, including our meetings twice in Moscow, for intra-Afghan talks.

What is your reaction to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which says that Afghanistan, along with Bangladesh and Pakistan, is a country from where India will accept persecuted minorities?

[The CAA] was India’s decision, and they may have had reasons for it and the law brought to Parliament. We don’t have persecuted minorities in Afghanistan… the whole country is persecuted. We have been in war and conflict for a long time. All religions in Afghanistan: Muslims and Hindus and Sikhs, which are our three main religions, have suffered.

The feeling in Afghanistan is very different to what the perception here in India may be. When I became President, the Principal of a school, in his 90s, whom I had known for many years, came to see me. As he left, he said, ‘I have only one request: our Hindus and Sikhs have suffered a lot more [during the Taliban regime], and they deserve much more, so bring them back from wherever they have fled in Pakistan or India, and restore their properties.’

That is the sentiment in Afghanistan. And I hope that sentiment would be reflected in India as well with regard to other Afghans, who are Muslim, as well.

Back in Afghanistan, the final results of the elections are still awaited. How do you see the political future of Afghanistan?

We needed to focus exclusively on peace [first], and through that bring enfranchisement to the Afghan people on a much larger scale, and then go for elections. That didn’t happen, and now we are in trouble, because the Afghan people did not turn up to vote. This was a referendum against the prevailing situation in Afghanistan, against all that is wrong: the foreign aggression, the war and the suffering of the Afghan people. We hope that people now accept the results, whatever they are, and the emerging government will be wise enough to try and work for legitimacy and bringing the nation together for peace. India should really look at Afghanistan; people who have such love for India, and help us work towards peace in Afghanistan.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/23x3jx/article30600573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-HAMIDKARZAI-AP-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/all-afghans-have-been-persecuted-karzai/article30600574.ece
120,2020/01/19,45 exploited Madhya Pradesh workers return after paying ‘recovery amount’,"When 16-year-old Ajeet Kumar, a school dropout, left home for the first time to work — that too 1,100 km away in Maharashtra — he was certain he would return with enough to at least pay his younger brother’s school fee. He stuffed two pairs of shirts and pants, a shawl and a blanket in a backpack, his only concern being to somehow keep the cold away while harvesting sugarcane for two months.

But within days of work, the 45 agricultural labourers from Gond and Baiga tribes, including him, escaped into the forest to flee confinement by the contractor, whose men caught them later on a highway. What got them safely back home to the Surehali village of Mandla district in Madhya Pradesh from Kolhapur district in Maharashtra was Mr. Kumar’s mobile phone, and grit.

“They told us they bought us for ₹4.5 lakh, and so we were indebted, had to work without protest on any condition, and couldn’t leave,” said Mr. Kumar, whose parents, brother and an elder sister desperately waited for his return home, as a small plot, on which a decrepit two-room hut now stands, is all they own.

Paltry wage

Originally promised ₹400 a day per person, a wage startlingly high and unheard of, the labourers felt betrayed upon reaching fields where only ₹250 was offered for a tonne of harvest. Up in arms, the toli (batch) of 14 women carrying three toddlers, with the rest of the group teenagers above 12 and men, refused to work, as 20 persons could harvest only 10-12 tonnes a day, which meant a paltry ₹125 for each of them.

On being caught, the men bore thrashing with sticks and the women threats of sexual assault, and their phones and ATM cards were snatched. Mr. Kumar, along with four others, managed to sneak back into the forest, and called back home to explain the ordeal using the phone he had kept hidden. His father then approached Ghughri police in Mandla district, which contacted the Ajara Police in Kolhapur district, which reportedly facilitated a settlement, and both the police units ensured their return.

Punishing conditions

The labourers worked from 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. without a break for around 25 days. “They poked us with sticks from behind whenever we looked around while working, or took a break,” said Hira Singh, 65. “We bathed only once in 15 days, and were not given enough to eat. The children were beginning to fall ill.”

First, a local contractor, Raju Kodape, went door-to-door in Surehali, luring workers offering the high wage. “We were thrilled at the opportunity. Even in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, where we seasonally migrate, it’s ₹300-350 a day per person [as wage],” said Mr. Singh, adding that almost all 400 families of the village migrated for work.

Then, on December 10, cooped up in a truck, the batch was taken to Jabalpur, 130 km away. “They covered our faces with clothes, telling us it would help us keep warm. They made sure the back of the truck was always covered with a tarpaulin sheet,” said Tija Bai. “We travelled only at night, and halted at dawn.” From Jabalpur, they were taken to Nagpur in a bus, and then to Amaravati, Pune, and finally Kolhapur, after a two-day journey.

‘Harrowing experience’

On reaching there, Mr. Kodape handed them over to another contractor, Bhaskar, who employed them on fields, lined with makeshift huts for stay. On Saturday, vary of outsiders, Surehali residents kept sticks, and bows and arrows ready in case of an attack by the contractors, as they had approached the police. “We don’t know if we would migrate again for work after this harrowing experience. But then, there are no means of livelihood here,” said Pahal Singh, 32.

The labourers had taken an advance of ₹10,000 each from the contractor, said a police complaint filed by them in the Ghughri station upon their return on January 13. “They wanted to leave without harvesting sugarcane and returning the advance amount. They were not held hostage, rather they just wanted to run away. In their statement, there is no mention of thrashing,” claimed Ajara Police Station In-Charge Balaji Bhange. “There is no basis for a case.”

Meanwhile, T.P. Choubey, Assistant Sub Inspector at the Ghugri Police Station, said the labourers had requested the police to register a case. “Since the incident occurred in Maharashtra, a case has to be registered there,” he added. So far, the case hasn’t been registered neither in Madhya Pradesh or in Maharashtra. “We don’t have a count of how many labourers migrate every season for work,” he added.

‘I don’t spare them’

“I have been a contractor since Raja Hindustani was released,” Bhaskar, the contractor, told The Hindu over the phone from Kolhapur, referring to the 1996 film. “The labourers fled with implements and were ready to fight back. Yes, they were threatened by the owner of the field, not me, so I am not responsible. Still, let me tell you, I don’t make a mistake, but when others do, I don’t spare them.”

Moreover, claimed Mr. Bhaskar, there were another 25 labourers from the Mandla district working for him, and “they didn’t have any issues.” He claimed he had spent more than ₹20,000 for the travel of the 45 labourers, and let them go only after they paid him ₹30,000 as recovery amount.

The labourers said their families had to sell jewellery and utensils, and mortgage land, to collect the amount before transferring it to them, to secure their release.

‘Not trafficking’

“We can’t register a case of trafficking unless the affected families approach us claiming that,” said R. R. S. Parihar, Mandla Superintendent of Police, adding that he wasn’t aware of the complaint by the labourers. “Nor can there be a case of bonded labour as they went there on agreements, based on the Girmitiya system prevailing since the British, under which labourers went to work in the Pacific. Now, we are keeping a track of migrations and recording details of contractors.”

In their complaint, the labourers have claimed they were held hostage and thrashed. “In cases of trafficking, workers are loath to come forward and file complaints as most often, family members are involved in enabling a racket,” said Ajay Sahare, an expert on bonded labour with ActionAid India, a non-profit. “Moreover, the advance payment after lurement can be construed as debt forcing them to work, thereby making them bonded labourers. The government must come up with a rehabilitation policy for them, and provide them alternative livelihoods.”

Bonded labour

According to the National Human Rights Commission, a person becomes a bonded labourer when their labour is demanded as a means of repayment for a loan. The person is then tricked or trapped into working for very little or no pay. It is prohibited by the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, and violates Articles 21 and 23 of the Constitution.

Meanwhile, an official of the Mandla Labour Department, requesting anonymity, claimed the police had not even considered if they were bonded labourers, thereby not following the due legal procedure in securing their “release”, and acted in haste. It had sought a report from the police on the episode.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xzzzw5/article30600984.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-01-18-at-23815-PM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/45-exploited-madhya-pradesh-workers-return-after-paying-recovery-amount/article30600469.ece
121,2020/01/19,Congress in Madhya Pradesh may get full-time head soon,"Chief Minister Kamal Nath, who has also been heading the Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) for the past 20 months, will soon make way for a new party president. Sources told The Hindu that a new president might be announced in the next 10 days.

Senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, considered the front runner, is learnt to have met Congress president Sonia Gandhi last Wednesday.

For several months now, amid reports of Mr. Scindia considering other political options, his supporters have been pushing for his elevation as the MPCC president. His changing bio on his Twitter handle to ‘public servant, cricket enthusiast’ from Congress general secretary and former Lok Sabha member only added to the confusion. But he dismissed the speculation as “baseless”. With his meeting with Ms. Gandhi, the expectations of his elevation have risen again.

Mr. Scindia, who has been touring the State for the past two days, has been given a rousing welcome by party workers. On Sunday, he launched the State’s pulse polio immunisation campaign in Bhopal.

Sources familiar with the developments, however, said the party would also make other changes — accommodating “performing” lawmakers and local leaders as heads of corporations and cooperatives and elevating district leaders to the MPCC. The aim will be a fine balance among different factions of the Congress which has returned to power after 15 years of BJP rule. And in the Congress, where workers owe their allegiance to leaders rather than the party, the high command will also have to factor in the views of other senior leaders like former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh. It is no secret that Mr. Scindia and Mr. Digvijaya Singh are not the best of friends, though all factions had worked together to defeat the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in the December, 2018 election.

Another crucial State where the party is set to appoint new leadership is Karnataka. D.K. Shivakumar is the front runner for the post of president. Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who recently met Ms. Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, is said to be pushing for M.B. Patil. But party sources said Mr. Shivakumar would likely be rewarded for playing the role of a troubleshooter.

122,2020/01/19,SFI moves Supreme Court challenging Citizenship Amendment Act,"The Students’ Federation of India (SFI) has moved the Supreme Court challenging The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, claiming it is “discriminatory” in nature and is “destructive” for the core principles of Indian constitutionalism.

The CAA, which was notified on January 10, grants Indian citizenship to non-Muslim minorities — Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian — who migrated to India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014, following persecution over their faith.

In its plea, the SFI has sought to declare the CAA “violative” of the Indian Constitution, saying “explicit preference to certain religious groups to the exclusion of others can never, in the Indian constitutional scheme, constitute a valid and reasonable classification meeting the test of Article 14 (equality before law) of the Constitution.”

Besides, the plea has sought to strike down certain provisions of The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, and The Foreigners Act, 1946, claiming that they violate the Constitution. “Student members of the petitioner (SFI) are immensely disturbed by the enactment of The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, and view it as being destructive of core principles of Indian Constitutionalism,” the plea said.

No question of repeal or amendment

It said the Centre, despite being fully aware of the “protests and disaffection among the masses” with the CAA, has categorically and unequivocally reiterated its position and stated that there is no question of repeal or amendment of this statute. “The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution since it discriminates only on the ground of religion, inasmuch as identically situated persons who face persecution in India’s neighbourhood stand excluded from the beneficial embrace of the act only because they do not fall within the six religious communities listed in the Act,” the plea said.

On December 18, 2019, the top court had issued a notice to the Centre and sought its response by the second week of January on a batch of pleas challenging the CAA’s legality.

The Supreme Court fixed January 22 for hearing several anti-CAA petitions, including those filed by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh.

123,2020/01/19,19 Indians kidnapped by pirates near Nigerian coast released,"Nineteen Indians, kidnapped by pirates from a commercial vessel from the high seas off the western coast of Africa last month, have been released while one died in their captivity, according to the Indian mission here.

Twenty Indian crew members were kidnapped from the vessel MV Duke in the high seas off the western coast of Africa on December 15.

The High Commission of India in Abuja on Sunday tweeted that 19 Indian nationals were released on Saturday while one died in the captivity of the pirates in “adverse conditions“.

India thanked the Nigerian authorities for their assistance in the release of the abducted Indians.

“Indian Govt. and Mission gave highest priority and worked with @NigeriaGov on release of 20 Indian seafarers kidnapped on 15 Dec. from MV Duke. 19 were released yesterday. One sadly died in captivity in adverse conditions. Our deepest condolences. Mission assisting in speedy return,” the Indian High Commission tweeted.

The intense campaign will take place all over the country, he said while briefing the media about the three-day central committee held at Vilapilsala near Thiruvananthapuram.

The central committee also urged the people not to answer the National Population Register (NPR) questions.

“The central committee has called upon the people not to answer any questions concerning the NPR when the enumerators come to their houses...,” the Left leader said.

'Come clean on deradicalisation camps'

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on January 19 demanded that the Union government come clean on the deradicalisation camps operating in India.

He described as “outrageous” the disclosure of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Gen. Bipin Rawat that deradicalisation camps were operating in the country.

The CDS had said there is need for deradicalisation of Muslim youth, particularly in Kashmir.

“Army commanders are entering domestic politics. This is unprecedented.

125,2020/01/19,NCST to ask Chhattisgarh to probe if refugee resettlement led to demographic changes in tribal areas,"The National Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) will ask the Chhattisgarh government to probe if the resettlement of Bangladeshi refugees has led to demographic changes in tribal areas, according to officials.

It will also ask the Chhattisgarh government to probe complaints of the refugees “displacing” a large number of tribals from their land in the Bastar region and “inflicting atrocities” on them, an NCST official told PTI.

A number of tribal representatives raised these issues during the Commission’s visit to the State last month, the official said.

“The government resettled a large number of Bengali refugees, who came to India from East Pakistan [now Bangladesh] after Partition, in Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and the Northeast under the Dandakaranya project that started in 1958. Many more came after the 1971 India-Pakistan War,” the official said.

In Chhattisgarh, the Bengali refugees were resettled in the Bastar region, especially Kanker district.

“During our visit to Chhattisgarh, tribal representatives claimed that the influx of refugees over the years has led to demographic changes in tribal areas,” the official said.

The Commission has also received complaints about the refugees “displacing a large number of tribals from their land and inflicting atrocities on them”, he said.

NCST chairman Nand Kumar Sai said, “The matter pertains to the Bastar region. We have told the Chhattisgarh government that it is a serious issue and a thorough investigation is needed.”

“Tribal areas are special areas as per the Constitution and a demographic change is a serious threat to the rights of the indigenous people,” he said.

The Commission will ask the State government to furnish the number of Bangladeshi refugees resettled in the state initially and their current population.

“The State government will be asked to find out if the number of refugees has exceeded the tribal population, and how many cases of Bangladeshi refugees displacing tribals from their land have been reported,” the official said.

The Commission has apprised Chhattisgarh Governor Anusuiya Uikey, who has also served as the Vice-Chairperson of the NCST in the past, of the issue, another official said.

When contacted, Chhattisgarh’s Scheduled Tribes Department Secretary D.D. Singh said, “The commission has informed us that certain issues have surfaced during their visit to the state and that they are preparing a report. We are awaiting a formal communication from the NSCT.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ncst-to-ask-chhattisgarh-to-probe-if-refugee-resettlement-led-to-demographic-changes-in-tribal-areas/article30600100.ece
126,2020/01/19,NRC will protect rights of minorities ‘taken away’ by Bangladeshi infiltrators: Jharkand BJP,"The Jharkhand BJP on Sunday said the National Register of Citizens (NRC) will protect the rights of minorities of the country which have been “taken away” by Bangladeshi infiltrators.

“...minorities living in the country will get their legitimate rights and NRC will protect their rights taken away by infiltrators from Bangladesh,” State BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said in a statement here.

He asked the opposition parties not to “instil fears in the minds of minorities” over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and instead, tell them that CAA has “nothing against them“.

“...CAA underlines that any person belonging to communities like Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, Christian and Sikh and has come to India from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh on or before December 1, 2014, will not be treated as an illegal infiltrator (immigrant),” Mr. Shahdeo said.

Section 6B (4) of the CAA states that the Act will not be effective in tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura, besides the areas falling under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, he said.

The BJP leader also accused the opposition parties of indulging in appeasement politics as they were “unable to fathom” the developmental initiatives undertaken by the central government.

“The Opposition parties feel shattered with the Narendra Modi government’s developmental work, prompting them to indulge in appeasement politics,” Mr. Shahdeo added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i1p9hk/article30599990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pratul-Shahdeo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nrc-will-protect-rights-of-minorities-taken-away-by-bangladeshi-infiltrators-jharkand-bjp/article30599991.ece

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal said the session was being convened early this year because the reservation for the SCs and the STs would expire on January 25.

128,2020/01/19,CISF deployment on campus: Visva Bharati university may drop plan as cost runs high,"Visva Bharati University, which had sought CISF deployment on its campus citing security concerns, is likely to drop the plan as the cost for the paramilitary force deployment is too high for the varsity’s budget for security.

The cost worked out after the CISF audit is over 4 times the budget of the university for maintenance of security on campus. So, the university may consider to drop the plan, a source told PTI.

CISF, officials, however, said they have not received any final word on the move yet.

A team had gone for the survey at the campus and informed officials about the requirement of the force including setting up barracks, gadgets and the estimated manpower. We had not given any exact figures for the cost but explained the requirements, a CISF official said.

Calls and text messages to Visva Bharati Vice Chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty, went unanswered.

The Home Ministry had in November last year accorded its approval for deployment of the CISF at the university, paving way for Visva Bharati to become the first educational institution or university to have paramilitary personnel stationed on campus.

The Vice Chancellor had written to the CISF alleging that private security personnel employed by the university owe their allegiance to Trinamool local bosses .

The letter was also marked to the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry, which had forwarded it to the paramilitary force. The CISF then had detailed its procedure for deploying a contingent, including conducting required checks and surveys.

The vice-chancellor had cited incidents of confrontation between the university administration, students and staff, in his letter to request for CISF deployment on the campus.

“There have been instances of students staging protest and preventing faculty members and officials from leaving the campus when security guards remained silent onlookers and even created enabling conditions for protesters,” the letter by Mr. Chakrabarty had said.

The letter has also stated that the cost of deployment of the CISF personnel will be borne by the university out of the grants it receives from the government.

The move had found opposition among students, who launched a signature campaign to oppose the move of CISF contingent deployment.

Visva Bharati established in 1921 by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore, was declared a central university in 1951.

The CISF guards vital installations in the country, including the Delhi Metro, 61 civil airports and organisations in the aerospace and nuclear domain.

It was tasked to extend its armed security cover, exclusively from the existing government sector deployment, to private installations after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks in which Pakistan-based terrorists targeted five-star hotels and other locations killing over 166 people.

Currently, ten installations in the private sector are guarded by the 1.50-lakh personnel strength force that includes Infosys campuses in Bengaluru, Pune and Mysuru and the Reliance refinery in Jamnagar among others.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2r3ala/article30599759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Santiniketan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cisf-deployment-on-campus-visva-bharati-university-may-drop-plan-as-cost-runs-high/article30599749.ece
129,2020/01/19,"Nobody gives NITI Aayog member the right to utter nonsense against us, says Kashmir trade body","The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), an apex trade body, on Sunday condemned NITI Aayog member V.K. Saraswat’s reported remarks that the Union Territory’s economy was not significantly affected by the Internet suspension and the data service was only used to watch “dirty films”, and demanded his immediate removal.

“We condemn these remarks. They are spreading venom against the people of Kashmir. Nobody gives him the right to speak like this about the people of Jammu and Kashmir and utter this nonsense against us,” KCCI president Sheikh Ashiq told PTI.

Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the annual convocation at Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT) in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, on Saturday, Mr. Saraswat said, “What difference does it make if there’s no Internet there (Kashmir)? What do you watch on Internet there? What e-tailing is happening there? Besides watching dirty films, you do nothing there.” \

‘Valley suffering’

Mr. Ashiq said the whole world knows that the Valley is suffering due to the Internet shutdown and the losses to the business sector here have amounted to over ₹18,000 crore in the past six months.

“We at the Chamber know that our economy has been deeply affected by the suspension of Internet services. Every sector of our economy has suffered a great deal. If any person says something like this, it speaks a volume about his mind capacity. He has no right to sit in the NITI Aayog,” he said.

The KCCI recently submitted a detailed report about the business losses in the Kashmir valley to Lieutenant Governor G.C. Murmu and Union minister of Commerce Piyush Goyal as well as MoS PMO Jitendra Singh.

Mr. Ashiq said the Union Territory is going through a very difficult and challenging phase and people like Mr. Saraswat at the NITI Aayog can do no justice to Jammu and Kashmir and demanded his immediate sacking.

“People like him are taking advantage of the situation and talking non-sense. We can read between the lines that such filthy minds can do no justice in the NITI Aayog. We urge the government of India to remove such persons immediately as they can do no justice to the job they are assigned to.

Mr. Ashiq said considering the present state of the economy of not only Kashmir but all over the country “which is moving from bad to worse” and the “failure” to formulate any redressive policy by the government and the NITI Aayog, it would have been better if Mr. Saraswat would have chosen to maintain his silence.

“The statement is not only unbecoming, but also maligns the population of Kashmir. The losses caused to our economy is a matter of record and cannot be swept under the carpet by issuance of absurd and factually incorrect statements,” he said.

Internet services, landline and mobile phones were snapped across Jammu and Kashmir on the eve of Centre’s announcement to scrap special status of the erstwhile state and its bifurcation into Union Territories on August 5.

While most of the services except mobile Internet were restored in Jammu within a week, Kashmir witnessed restoration of landlines and postpaid mobile services and Internet facilities to essential services like hospitals in phases.

On Saturday, The Jammu and Kashmir administration ordered the restoration of the prepaid mobile service in the Valley after over five months of suspension besides the 2G mobile data service on postpaid connections for accessing “whitelisted” sites across the Jammu division.

Saraswat said the suspension of Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir did not have any significant impact on the economy, as people there “did nothing other than watching dirty films online.”

He also said that Internet services were suspended in Jammu and Kashmir to prevent certain elements from “misusing” information that could affect law and order situation there.

Mr. Saraswat was speaking to reporters in Gandhinagar on Saturday after attending the convocation of the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology.

“What difference does it make if there’s no Internet there? What do you watch on Internet there? What e-tailing is happening there? Besides watching dirty films, you do nothing there,” he said.

“If there is no Internet in Kashmir, it does not have any significant effect on the economy,” he added.

Mr. Saraswat said the reason for suspending Internet services in Jammu and Kashmir was to prevent certain elements from misusing information.

“If Article 370 had to be removed, and if Kashmir had to be taken forward, we knew there were elements there which will misuse this kind of information in a manner that will affect the law and order situation,” he said.

Kashmir trade body condemns remarks

The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), an apex trade body, condemned Mr. Saraswat’s remarks that the Union Territory’s economy was not significantly affected by the Internet suspension and the data service was only used to watch “dirty films”, and demanded his immediate removal.

On recent protests in Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Mr. Saraswat said the institution has become a “political battleground” with half of the teachers being “hardcore Leftists“.

Mr. Saraswat also said that protests like those against the Citizenship Amendment Act and in JNU affect the economy.

“The losses are affecting the economy. We are giving people money, but there is no output from them. Government teachers are getting their dues despite the strike.

“A State Assembly has passed a resolution against CAA. It is like making a political statement. We can understand that. But saying they will not implement it, is against the law. It is unconstitutional to say that”, she said.

Ms. Sitharaman was responding to a query from the audience, at an event on the CAA, organised by Chennai Citizens’ Forum, on some States like Kerala having opposed the implementation of the CAA.

“Everybody in this country has the responsibility to implement the law which has been passed in the Parliament,”, the Minister, who is here as part of BJP’s nationwide ‘Jan Jagran Abhiyan’ campaign in support of the Act, said.

The Kerala government last week moved the Supreme Court against the CAA, seeking for the Act to be declared “violative of the principles of equality, freedom and secularism enshrined in the Constitution”.

The amendment bill, currently under the review of the committee, seeks to increase the executive and financial powers of autonomous councils in the sixth schedule areas of the Northeast.

The Congress MP, who was in Shillong to hold a meeting with the representatives of the Meghalaya government and three autonomous district councils (ADCs), said he was apprised of the concerns of local people over the proposed amendment.

He, however, refused to share the details.

“Hopefully, the committee will be able to submit its report to Parliament by March. I am not going to share any details (as of now),” the Rajya Sabha MP told reporters.

In a newspaper interview, she said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had personally assured her that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) was an internal matter of India that would not affect her people.

“We don’t understand why (the Indian government) did it. It was not necessary,” Ms. Hasina told Gulf News in Abu Dhabi where she held high-level meetings. The statement is the first by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh since the controversial law, that has triggered protests across India, was cleared by the Rajya Sabha on December 11.

During the parliamentary debates, Home Minister Amit Shah repeatedly referred to persecution faced by minority communities, mainly the Hindus, in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan arguing that these groups should get citizenship rights in India. Ms. Hasina distanced her country from the line taken by the Indian government.

“It is an internal affair. Bangladesh has always maintained that the CAA and NRC are internal matters of India. The government of India, on their part, has also repeatedly maintained that the NRC is an internal exercise of India, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in person assured me of the same during my visit to New Delhi in October 2019,” she said during the interview.

Ms. Hasina’s government has said that minority communities did not leave her country because of persecution and maintained that there is no reverse migration from India either. “But within India, people are facing many problems,” she declared.

Subsequent to the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, Bangladesh cancelled several high-level meetings to India that included the visits of Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan among others. Last week, Dhaka cancelled the visit of its State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam, who was to address the Raisina Dialogue.

Ms. Hasina highlighted the burden that Myanmar’s Rohingya refugees were placing on her country and said that the continued presence of the million plus Rohingya in Bangladesh would affect security and stability in the South Asian region.

Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh has also filed a similar suit, challenging the constitutional validity of the National Investigation Agency Act.

The rise in retail price inflation to a nearly six-year high of 7.35% in December has led to increasing worries that the Indian economy may be headed towards stagflation. The current rise in retail inflation has been attributed mainly to the rise in the prices of vegetables such as onions. Still, the steady rise in wider inflation figures over the last few months amidst falling economic growth has led to fears of stagflation.

138,2020/01/19,CPI(M) leader Yusuof Tarigami says Bipin Rawat’s ‘deradicalisation camps’ remark shocking,"The comment of the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), General Bipin Rawat, on “deradicalisation camps” is unconstitutional and shocking, CPI(M) leader Yusuof Tarigami has said.

The Union government should come clear on Gen. Rawat’s comments and clarify whether such camps were indeed being run by it, Mr. Tarigami said in a statement.

“It’s shocking to hear such comments. What the General said goes beyond his brief and the BJP government must clear its stand on this issue.” The government should tell the public where these ‘400 camps’ are as stated by Gen. Rawat, Mr. Tarigami said.

“Deradicalisation camps are completely un-Indian and the assumption that they are needed for a certain age group in one area of the country is clearly a fantasy. Radicalisation should not be associated with just one religion. The fact is radicalisation is taking place in other religions too,” he said. There were already many jails, camps and police stations in Kashmir and there was no need for “concentration camps” too.

“If at all there is radicalisation in Kashmir, it is because of disillusionment. Whatever unilateral decisions taken by the Centre on August 5 are bound to increase the disillusionment.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pisqmk/article30595804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19TARIGAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cpim-leader-yusuof-tarigami-says-bipin-rawats-deradicalisation-camps-remark-shocking/article30595805.ece

These implants are used by persons with hearing impairment.

In his letter, he pointed out that cochlear implants attracted five per cent GST and its accessories were taxed at 12-18 per cent. “As per the 2011 Census, there are 1.26 million people with hearing disabilities and a large number of such people are from the poor and vulnerable sections of the population,” Mr. Gandhi wrote, requesting the government to reconsider the tax rates.

Seeks spice park

The Wayanad MP, in separate letters to Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Food Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, also requested the government to set up a spice park and mega food park in his constituency.

Writing to Mr. Goyal, Mr. Gandhi said Wayanad was a major production centre for coffee and spices in Kerala. It was also the largest producer of turmeric and the second largest producer of pepper in the State. However, there was lack of a wider marketing network and value addition facilities for processing the spices. He has urged the Commerce Ministry to set up a spice park in Wayanad to provide the requisite processing facilities.

142,2020/01/19,"A month on, police struggle to make charges stick against anti-CAA protesters in Muzaffarnagar","Almost a month after the police accused around 259 people of rioting, arson and attempt to murder during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Muzaffarnagar and arrested around 82 persons, local courts have granted bail to almost 40 of them, dropping serious charges against them.

On Saturday, three students of madrasa Hoja Ilimiya were granted bail by Chief Judicial Magistrate Ravikant Yadav, after serious charges, including Section 307, were dropped against them. Only Sections 188 (violation of Section 144) and 143 (unlawful assembly) remain against them.

On Friday, District Judge Sanjay Kumar Pachauri allowed the bail pleas of 14 arrested in connection with the protest on December 20, 2019, and directed that they be released after furnishing sureties of Rs 1 lakh each.

Ten students of madrasa Hoja Ilimya, who were arrested from Sadaat Hostel, were granted bail earlier this month. The police did not find any evidence against them except for the violation of prohibitory orders.

Five students of the same madrasa and four government officials were earlier released under Section 169 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for want of evidence.

“It shows the police are struggling to make the charges stick,” said Akram Akhtar, advocate and social activist. “However, the police are still detaining people because they have a long list of unnamed persons to fill. Still, there has been no action against people who targeted shops of Muslims on the day of the protest,” he added.

Local sources said police randomly picked people from the site of protest. A special investigation team went through the CCTV details and released people on its basis. “They have to show that due process is being followed,” said a local journalist, requesting anonymity. He alleged that the release of students was a kind of give and take with the madrasa authorities, considering the latter had almost given a clean chit to the police.

Advocate Ali Zaidi of Human Rights Law Network, who has filed a PIL petition in the Allahabad High Court on police excesses in Muzaffarnagar, said: “The FIR against thousands of unnamed persons could become a tool of repression in the hands of local police and would encourage corruption.” Interestingly, charges are also being added as the police added sections of Juvenile Act, 2015 against 33 people for inciting children to throw stones.

Atul Kumar, Additional District Magistrate, said due process was being followed. “The charges can only be dropped at the stage of chargesheet.

143,2020/01/19,"Behmai massacre case diary missing, judge puts off verdict","The case diary of the Behmai massacre, in which 20 people were killed allegedly by bandit Phoolan Devi’s gang nearly four decades ago, was found missing on Saturday when a special court was to pronounce its verdict, prompting the judge to postpone the matter to January 24.

Special judge (U.P. dacoity-affected area) Sudhir Kumar pulled up the court official for inability to produce the case diary at the time of delivering the verdict and asked him to place it before the court on January 24.

The court is likely to give its verdict on the role of the four surviving accused — Posha, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Shyambabu. While Posha is still in jail, the rest are out on bail. Three other dacoits, including Phoolan Devi’s close friend Man Singh, are absconding.

‘Bandit Queen’ Phoolan Devi, who later entered politics, and her gang members were accused of killing the 20 people belonging to the Thakur community at Behmai village in Kanpur Dehat on February 14, 1981. Phoolan Devi had stormed into Behmai in what was described as an attack to avenge her alleged rape there by two other bandits — Lala Ram and Sri Ram — both Thakurs, a dominant caste in the village.

She had surrendered to the Madhya Pradesh police two years after the incident. She then went on to become a Lok Sabha member from Mirzapur for the first time in 1996 and then in 1999 on Samajwadi Party ticket.

Initially, 35 people, including Phoolan Devi, were named as accused in the case. Eight of them were reportedly killed by the police in separate encounters.

The Behmai killings had a political fallout, when the then U.P. Chief Minister V.P. Singh, who later became the Prime Minister, resigned owning moral responsibility for the massacre.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lvnch5/article30597050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHOOLANDEVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/behmai-massacre-case-diary-missing-judge-puts-off-verdict/article30597051.ece
144,2020/01/19,Explained | Can States challenge the validity of central laws?,"The story so far: Amid nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or CAA, 2019, and the threat of non-cooperation by some States with the Central government’s plan to update the National Population Register (NPR) and possibly establish a National Register of Indian Citizens, Kerala has filed a suit in the Supreme Court of India seeking to declare the CAA as unconstitutional. Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh has also filed a similar suit, challenging the constitutional validity of the National Investigation Agency Act. Both have invoked Article 131, which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the top court to adjudicate disputes between two or more States, or between States and the Centre. Punjab has also decided to challenge the CAA in the Supreme Court.

What does Article 131 say? Why is it necessary?

Article 131 confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Supreme Court in disputes involving States, or the Centre on the one hand and one or more States on the other. This means no other court can entertain such a dispute. It is well-known that both High Courts and the Supreme Court have the power to adjudicate cases against the State and Central governments. In particular, the validity of any executive or legislative action is normally challenged by way of writ petitions — under Article 226 of the Constitution in respect of High Courts, and, in respect to fundamental rights violations, under Article 32 in the Supreme Court.

What happens when a State feels its legal rights have been violated by another State or by the Centre?

Unlike individuals, State governments cannot complain of fundamental rights being violated. Therefore, the Constitution provides that whenever a State feels that its legal rights are under threat or have been violated, it can take the “dispute” to the Supreme Court. States have filed such cases under Article 131 against neighbouring States in respect of river water sharing and boundary disputes. There have been instances of such cases being filed against the Centre too.

What does Kerala’s suit ask for?

Kerala’s suit asks for a declaration that the CAA, 2019, is violative of the Constitution, and against the principle of secularism that is a basic feature of the Constitution. Simultaneously, it challenges the validity of notifications issued under the Passport (Entry into India) Amendment Rules and the Foreigners (Amendment) Order, in 2015-16, as being contrary to the Constitution.

The notifications of 2015 had given exemption to persons belonging to minority communities in Bangladesh and Pakistan — namely, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who were compelled to seek shelter in India due to religious persecution or the fear of religious persecution and entered India on or before December 31, 2014, without valid documents — from the purview of the laws against illegal entry of foreigners into India. In 2016, further notifications were issued to add those who arrived from Afghanistan too. As these notifications formed the basis for creating the categories of people who were not to be treated as illegal migrants, and as the CAA chooses the same groups for conferment of citizenship on a fast-track mode, the Kerala government has challenged the validity of these notifications too. Another reason is that the term “religious persecution” is not found in the CAA, but it mentions that those exempted from the Foreigners’ Act under the 2015 and 2016 notifications will not be treated as “illegal migrants”.

What is the prayer in Chhattisgarh’s suit?

Chhattisgarh has sought a declaration that the NIA Act, 2008, is unconstitutional on the ground that it is “beyond the legislative competence of Parliament”. It argues that ‘Police’ is a subject reserved for the States, and having a central police agency, which has overriding powers over the State police, with no provision for consent from the State government for its operations, is against the division of legislative powers between the Centre and the States. And that it is against the federal spirit of the Constitution.

Is such a suit maintainable?

There are two conflicting opinions of the Supreme Court on this point. In 2011, in State of Madhya Pradesh v. Union of India and Another, the court said: “...when the Central laws can be challenged in the State High Courts as well and also before this Court under Article 32, normally, no recourse can be permitted to challenge the validity of a Central law under the exclusive original jurisdiction of this Court provided under Article 131.”

However, in State of Jharkhand vs. State of Bihar and Another (2014), another Bench said it was unable to accept the view that the constitutionality of a law cannot be raised in a suit under Article 131. Therefore, the matter was referred to a larger Bench for an authoritative pronouncement.

One of the issues to be decided is whether such a suit involves a question “on which the existence or extent of a legal right depends”. Does Kerala’s objection to the CAA involve one of its “legal rights”? Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kummanam Rajasekharan has sought to intervene in the matter against the Kerala government’s plea, contending that Kerala has raised a dispute that does not involve any legal right, but is only a political question. And that, therefore, it cannot file a suit under Article 131 based on political questions. However, possibly in anticipation of such an objection, Kerala’s suit points out that under Article 256 of the Constitution, the State would be compelled to comply with the CAA and rules and orders passed by the Centre. As it believes that these laws and rules are arbitrary, unreasonable, and violative of fundamental rights, a dispute involving law and fact has indeed arisen between Kerala and the Centre. This dispute involves both the legal rights of the State and the fundamental rights and other legal rights of its inhabitants.

What is likely to happen?

Given the reference by a two-judge Bench, the Supreme Court may have to constitute a larger Bench to decide the question whether the suits challenging central laws are maintainable.

If the suits are declared maintainable, the same Bench may also adjudicate the disputes.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2wp83f/article30445707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kerala-Assembly-CAAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/can-states-challenge-the-validity-of-central-laws/article30595797.ece

146,2020/01/19,CPI demands Assembly resolution against CAA,"CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna on Sunday urged Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to ensure adoption of a resolution against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) during the special session of the Assembly beginning on Monday to discuss the capital issue.

Taking a cue from the Kerala and Punjab governments, the YSRCP government should facilitate adoption of a resolution to put pressure on the Central government to rescind the CAA, which was allegedly anti-Muslim.

Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu should also make amends by extending his party’s support for adoption of the resolution unanimously in the Assembly, he said at a rally organised by the Secularism Protection Forum here.

It was unfortunate that both the YSRCP and TDP had backed the CAA in Parliament for their own reasons.

The CPI, along with like-minded parties, would spearhead the ‘Amaravati Chalo’ protest if the YSRCP dilly-dallied on the issue, he warned.

147,2020/01/19,Congress dares Jagan to seek fresh mandate on capital,"The Congress party has dared Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to dissolve the government and seek a fresh mandate on relocating the capital.

The YSRCP government should take a cue from Brexit, where the incumbent government in the U.K. sought a referendum before announcing to withdraw from the European Union, N. Tulasi Reddy, Congress working president, told the media here on Sunday.

Mr. Reddy pointed out that the government could not unilaterally announce such a major policy decision.

“The voters would have rejected the YSRCP had it announced before the elections about its capital plan. Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy himself had accepted on the Floor of the House to continue the capital in and around Vijayawada. His party veteran Ummareddy Venkateswarlu also spoke about Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy building his residence in the capital region. What is he doing now?” Mr. Tulasi Reddy wondered.

While flaying TDP national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu for blowing the “Amaravati bubble” out of proportion and failing to live up to the people’s expectations, Mr. Tulasi Reddy minced no words in attacking Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s decision to move the capital.

He wondered how a State government could change the capital after it had been depicted on the national map.

APS protests

Members of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (APS) and leaders of various political parties have already given a call for ‘Chalo Assembly’ and ‘Jail Bharo’ opposing the State government’s move to set up three capitals.

A few political leaders have gone to the extent of calling upon the protesters to prevent the Ministers and MLAs from attending the Assembly session and disrupt the proceedings.

Members of the APS have intensified their protests as news spread that the government is mulling over discussing ways of setting up the Executive capital in Visakhapatnam, Legislative capital in Amaravati, and Judicial capital in Kurnool and making amends to certain Acts to facilitate the decentralisation process.

Prohibitory orders

Meanwhile, the police have made it clear that there is no permission for staging any kind of protest in the capital villages.

“Section 30 of the Police Act and Section 144 of the Cr.PC are in force in the villages. The people are requested not to violate the prohibitory orders,” Guntur Range IGP Vineet Brijlal said on Sunday.

“We request the APS members and other protesters not to cause any inconvenience to the public representatives, employees of Secretariat and High Court, and the general public. The villagers are advised not to provide accommodation to outsiders,” Mr. Vineet Brijlal said, and warned of action as per law against those who incite violence.

Guntur Urban Superintendent of Police P.H.D. Ramakrishna said that 5,000 police personnel had been deployed to ensure smooth functioning of the three-day Assembly session.

“Elaborate security has been arranged on all the roads leading to the Assembly. We have arranged pickets en route the Assembly. Similarly, pick-up and rope parties, and striking forces have been positioned at many points,” the SP said.

Meanwhile, the police served notices on a few political leaders and protesters asking them not to violate the prohibitory orders in force and indulge in violence during the Assembly session.

“Keeping in view of the recent attack on MLA Pinelli Ramakrishna Reddy’s vehicle and his security personnel at Chinakakani in Guntur district, we have made foolproof security arrangements for all the Ministers and MLAs,” a police officer said.

ERC Chairman Justice (retd.) C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy directed the DISCOMS to set up complaint boxes from the mandal level to the CMDs of DISCOMS in addition to the existing web-based and other complaint receiving systems.

This would enhance accountability among officials thereby ensure better service delivery, he said in a review meeting, according to an official release.

Justice Nagarjuna Reddy has categorically stated that agricultural lands should not be taken without the consent of farmers, for erecting transmission towers and installing High Tension (HT) power lines. He insisted that the power utilities should strictly adhere to rules so that farmers’ livelihood would not be in jeopardy.

The ERC chairman advised Energy Secretary N. Srikant to conduct meetings/video conferences with the District Collectors to see that fair compensation is provided to farmers on whose lands HT lines are laid, without inordinate delay.

Safety standards

He further suggested that an action plan be prepared by the DISCOMs and Chief Electrical Inspectorate for effective implementation of safety standards in DISCOMs to reduce accidents which were likely due to the negligence of power utilities.

The ERC is taking steps for strict monitoring of the standards of performance in DISCOMs and action taken for improving internal efficiencies.

The EU leaders are unhappy with the fact that the committee has not taken any of their views and suggestions into consideration and has given its report that recommends repeal of all the old facilities given to the employees and implementation of the only ones that the government employees have. “The RTC Board is scheduled to meet on Monday and make an official announcement on the issue after the meeting. We want the board members to withdraw their decision or else the employees will be forced to resort to an agitation,” said Y.V. Rao, president of the EU.

153,2020/01/19,"Assembly session begins Monday, govt. to take up three capitals proposal","The Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly session will begin at 11 a.m. on Monday and a decision on the State government’s plans to develop three capitals for “equitable and comprehensive development” is likely to be taken during the session. The government proposes to shift the Executive capital to Visakhapatnam from Amaravati and the High Court to Kurnool.

The government is expected to table the High Power Committee (HPC) report and its findings before the Assembly for discussion.

The HPC was appointed to study the report of the expert committee headed by former civil servant G. N. Rao and that of Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy held a preparatory meeting at his camp office on Sunday to chalk out a strategy to be adopted to get the Bills related to the three capitals’ proposal passed. The details of the meeting have not been disclosed.

No clear indication

It is not clear whether the government will present the Bills or make a statement on its proposals to develop three capitals.

In view of the heightened agitation against the proposal to shift the capital, the government may also come up with a Bill/ statement on Regional Development Boards. The officials and Ministers are tight-lipped in this regard.

The government has reportedly contemplated presenting Bills related to the abolition of the A.P. Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) and the proposal to develop three capitals, decentralisation of administration and development, in the Legislative Assembly.

Governor’s assent

But the Governor’s assent is mandatory if the Bill to repeal the CRDA Act is introduced. It may be a difficult task for the government to obtain the Governor’s nod and present the Bill on the first day of the session as the Governor “can seek legal opinion”.

If the CRDA is scrapped, the rules, notifications and Government Orders issued under the CRDA Act, which sought to develop some 33,000 acres in the capital region of Amaravati, will cease to exist. It will pave the way for shifting the capital. The CRDA Act specified a capital region for the State and shifting of the capital might not be possible unless the Act is repealed.

English medium

The Education Bill 1/1982-(Amendment Act) 2019, which enables English to be introduced as the medium of instruction in all government schools with Telugu as a compulsory subject, is also likely to be introduced during the session.

The Bill, which was passed by a voice vote in the Assembly in the previous session, was not approved in the Council, which sent it back to the Assembly with a few amendments to it.

Though it will be a cakewalk for the ruling YSR Congress Party to get the approval of the Assembly, it will be a Herculean task for the treasury benches to get the nod of the Council as the Opposition TDP has the upper hand in the House.

Though the YSRCP has an absolute majority in the Assembly (151 MLAs out of total 175), the Opposition TDP has 28 members in the 58-member Council (YSRCP has only nine MLCs).

A session of the Legislative Council will be held on January 21.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/assembly-session-begins-monday-govt-to-take-up-three-capitals-proposal/article30601444.ece
154,2020/01/19,TDP ready with its strategy committed to ‘one capital one Assembly’ policy,"With the State government keeping its information relating to the Bills to be presented in the Assembly as a closely ‘guarded secret,’ the Telugu Desam Legislature Party (TDLP) is apparently clueless whether the government would table a Bill on making Visakhapatnam an Executive capital. Notwithstanding, the TDLP has devised a strategy to counter the ruling YSRCP in the Assembly taking all possibilities, permutations and combinations into consideration.

The TDLP, which was presided over by party national president N. Chandrababu Naidu, has decided to oppose the government’s proposal on the capital tooth and nail if the Bill relating to it were tabled. The Telugu Desam, however, is sceptical whether it would be given ‘sufficient time’ to present its views and opinions.

“The TDP will make its stand clear on the capital. The facts will be placed before the House,” said a senior leader.

Party stand

The Telugu Desam Party is committed to ‘one capital one Assembly’ policy. The TDLP will act in the House in accordance with that policy. The TDLP expressed the view that shifting the Capital to Visakhapatnam might not benefit much as the city has already emerged as the financial capital of the State. Also, shifting few offices to North Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema would not yield any result as hyped, according to the leaders.

Interestingly, a few MLAs, including former Minister Ganta Srinivas Rao, Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar, Anagani Satya Prasad, and Adireddi Bhavani did not turn up for the meeting. Also, about 12 MLCs were not present.

The TDP senior leaders, however, say that all the MLAs would be present in the House on Monday. A few MLCs have not come as the Council is slated to begin on January 21. It may be recalled that the TDP already issued a whip that all MLAs should be present and vote in line with party decision in the Assembly.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lomyf1/article30604661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJPAGE4NAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tdp-ready-with-its-strategy-committed-to-one-capital-one-assembly-policy/article30601353.ece
155,2020/01/19,Hopes of Vizagites on Executive capital soar,"The Cabinet meeting and the Assembly session being held on Monday to discuss decentralisation and abrogation of APCRDA Act set expectations soaring on the prospects of declaring Visakhapatnam as the Executive capital of Andhra Pradesh.

YSR Congress Party leaders, including Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana and Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao, have openly challenged those opposing Visakhapatnam as the Executive capital. They have claimed that the idea has been mooted to put an end to the backwardness of North Andhra region.

Prof. K.S. Chalam, who served as member of UPSC as well as NHRC, has told The Hindu that if Visakhapatnam was made the capital, it would compete with New York in 100 years going by its inherent strengths.

Mr. Chalam, who has done extensive research on backwardness in the region, has said they have strongly represented to the Sivaramakrishnan panel with documentary evidence on how North Andhra had been meted out a step-motherly treatment by the powers-that-be.

“No government investment has been made in Visakhapatnam since 1953 and the city has transformed into a growing metropolis due to establishment of Visakhapatnam Port in 1933, Scindia Steam Navigation (now Hindustan Shipyard Ltd) in 1941 and a host of PSUs subsequently.”

“It remained a Buddhist hub since 3rd century BC. It has a glorious history with several geographical advantages,” he has said batting strongly in favour of making Visakhapatnam the capital for administrative convenience.

‘Capital-ready infra’

For Prof. V. Balamohan Das, former Vice-Chancellor of Acharya Nagarjuna University, Visakhapatnam is best suited due to its ‘capital-ready’ infrastructure. “A Greenfield capital at Amaravati will involve a huge investment with very less funding from the Centre. If made Executive capital, Visakhapatnam will need minimal investment. Robust infrastructure, connectivity and cosmopolitan culture are its biggest plus points,” he has averred.

“We are advocating distributed development. The mammoth capital city of Amaravati as conceived by the previous government would have involved a lot of social and environmental costs. We stated this at the time of the release of the Sivaramakrishnan report in 2014 and we reiterate now,” Human Rights Forum AP coordination committee member V.S Krishna has said.

Harbor International School CEO Raghu Raj Yerra says as an entrepreneur in the field of education, he is very elated that Visakhapatnam is being considered as an Executive capital. “It’s long overdue goodwill gesture to the City of Destiny.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pl4616/article30601263.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20ONGVIZAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hopes-of-vizagites-on-executive-capital-soar/article30601264.ece

157,2020/01/19,Horsley Hills adventure festival turns to be a big draw,"The three-day Horsley Hills Adventure Festival organized by the A.P. Tourism Department concluded on Sunday evening, with the place emerging as one of the premier tourism spots for adventure sports.

According to tourism officials, over 20,000 nature lovers and adventure junkies from across the country, mostly from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, took part in the event.

The colonial connection

Horsley Hills, located 1,290 metres above sea level and spread over 2 km radius, is best suited for rock climbing, gliding, trekking and cycling because of its zigzag terrain and a picturesque ghat road flanked by verdant forests.

In fact, it was the scenic beauty, coupled with the pleasant climate, that drew the attention of British officer W.D. Horsley in 1870, who later made it his home. Till Independence, Horsley Hills remained a hot destination for nature lovers, and enjoyed the patronage of the colonial rulers.

Till date, the hill station continues to lure tourists from the Southern States during the weekends. The adventure festival was the first such initiative taken by the tourism department. The district administration had earlier planned the event twice in the last five years, but it has only materialized now.

Kite festival

The festival hosted a number of activities, including spider-web, ladder, balancing beam, zigzag, cargo net, zip line, climbing wall, trampoline, and morning trekking. But the highlight of the event was rock climbing, thoroughly guided by expert coaches. Seconding it was the skating event that drew an impressive number of child participants from all over India, some of whom were national-level skaters.

The festival ended on a colourful note with the conduct of kite festival at Galibanda point on the hills.

District Collector Narayana Bharat Gupta expressed happiness at the overwhelming turnout and said that steps would be taken to introduce the adventure sports here on a permanent basis, apart from launching a special focus on developing infrastructure at multiple levels.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hhli20/article30600550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJHORSLEYHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/horsley-hills-adventure-festival-turns-to-be-a-big-draw/article30600551.ece

163,2020/01/19,"Better late than never, say Chittoor police","Prior to the rape and murder of Hyderabad veterinarian ‘Disha’ in November last year, Chittoor district was rocked by the heinous rape and murder of a five-year-old girl on November 7.

The perpetrator, after sexually assaulting and murdering the child at a marriage hall on the outskirts of Madanapalle town at midnight, threw the girl’s body off the terrace into a 30-foot-deep ditch behind the building.

The brutality of the crime shocked denizens of the district into action, spurring thousands of girls to come out on to the streets demanding swift justice for the victim. Many demanded that the culprit be either hanged in full public view or be shot dead by police in an ‘encounter’. The outpouring of public anger also contributed in large measure to the emergence of the Disha Act.

The accused in the crime, a 25-year-old truck cleaner and a native of Madanapalle, was arrested ten days after the episode. Police had acted swiftly in the case, completing the chargesheet procedure under the POSCO Act within 20 days. Deputy Superintendent of Police (Madanapalle) A. Ravi Manohar Achari said, ""We are expecting the judgment by January end. Once the Disha Act comes into force, such grave crimes against women could be judged in a matter of a week.""

Post the Disha incident in Hyderabad, a 40-year-old tailor had allegedly raped a 12-year-old mentally challenged girl when she came to get her clothes stitched at Pullur Cross junction of S.R. Puram mandal in December last. Deputy SP (Puttur) D. Murali Krishna said that the chargesheet was filed in a record 21 days in this case. In another case, on January 16, a man was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting his minor daughter at Vedurukuppam mandal. ""In this case also, we hope to file the chargesheet within the stipulated time,"" the official said.

Timely justice

Senior police officers maintain that the speed of filing chargesheets in these heinous crimes against women is a prelude to the forthcoming Disha Act. ""The provisions of the Disha Act would definitely go a long way towards curbing crimes against women. Before committing a crime, one would definitely think of the Act,"" Mr. Murali Krishna said.

According to the statistics of the District Crime Records Bureau (Chittoor), as many as 166 cases of outraging the modesty of women were recorded in 2018, followed by 214 in 2019. As many as 64 cases of rape were recorded in two years, followed by 63 cases of women committing suicide. In all, as many as 1,053 cases were registered in the two years under sections dealing with grave crimes against women, including murder for dowry, domestic violence and harassment.

Meanwhile, the Chittoor police are vying to have the first ‘Disha Police Station’ in the State, for which the venue and a separate building are being readied. DIG (Anantapur) Kanti Rana Tata and Superintendent of Police (Chittoor) S. Senthil Kumar wrapped up an initial round of meetings on the setting up of the Disha Police Station in Chittoor.

The move came after a patron filed a complaint with the DSO in this regard.

The customer said that he had asked for drinking water, but the restaurant staff refused to serve him regular water and gave him a bottle of mineral water. The customer did not drink from the bottle, but was reportedly charged by the restaurant for the unopened bottle.

The customer then lodged a complaint with Anantapur District Supply Officer Siva Sankar Reddy, who deputed his staff to the restaurant to verify the complaint. The restaurant staff reportedly claimed that they were unable to serve drinking water as it was not potable, and hence gave the customer a bottle of mineral water.

Mr. Sankar Reddy said that the restaurant was duty-bound to serve water along with food items, and along with ensuring the quality of food, it also has to ensure safe drinking water and cannot charge the customers on that count. In the bill submitted to the DSO, the mineral water bottle was charged at a higher price, which Mr. Reddy said was a violation.

In addition to this, for customers consuming food on their premises, promoting plastic bottles was also a violation as according to the rules laid down by the government, the usage of single-use plastic has to be reduced.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/av6yt1/article30596529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-VJ-RESTAURANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dso-orders-inquiry-as-restaurant-refuses-water/article30596530.ece

167,2020/01/19,On the fast track,"On November 27 last, a woman veterinarian who was returning home after a medical check-up was abducted by four persons near Tondupally toll gate in Hyderabad, allegedly gang raped and murdered. Her charred body was found a day later at an underpass near Chatanpalli.

The incident shook the nation, triggering widespread protests, as it happened after the Nirbhaya gang rape case in New Delhi in 2012.

Post Nirbhaya case, the Union Government passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 (Nirbhaya Act) on March 19, 2013, to speed up such cases and bring more types of offences against women under its ambit.

Taking a cue from this and the Hyderabad incident, the Andhra Pradesh government passed the Disha Act. The Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly passed two Bills — Andhra Pradesh Disha Act (AP Special Courts for Specified Offences against Women and Children Act 2019), and AP Disha Act – Criminal Law (AP Amendment) Act 2019. This Act envisages the completion of investigation in seven days and trial in 14 working days, which gives a total window of 21 days for the trial.

Apprehensions

Though the Disha Act was welcomed by many sections of the people, there were a few, including from the law enforcement agencies and legal fraternity, who expressed apprehensions.

""While on the one hand the Disha Act addresses the issue ‘Justice delayed is justice denied’ on the other, there is apprehension about ‘let a hundred guilty be acquitted, but one innocent should not be convicted’,"" said Kupilli Muralidhar from the District Legal Services Authority.

According to a few law enforcement officers, it may be difficult to complete the investigation within seven days, given the present circumstances of manpower crunch and lack of infrastructure, including availability of adequately-staffed and well-equipped forensic laboratories.

Many police officers feel that forensic reports play a crucial role in the investigation and it is difficult to get a complete report within seven days.

‘Not difficult’

But former Director-General of Police N. Sambasiva Rao differs. According to him, if there is will there is a way. ""With the present advancement in forensic science getting a semen report and matching it with the accused or for that matter a DNA report is not a difficult task. They can be given within three days, if a team is dedicated to the task,"" he said.

The legal fraternity also expressed doubts about the functioning of the legal procedure and lack of dedicated courts to handle such cases.

Direction to officers

To address the issue, Director-General of Police Gautam Sawang has a task cut out for his force and has given a standard operating procedure.

According to the new directive, every city and town will have a dedicated police station for women. And wherever there is a dedicated police station, it will be strengthened with adequate staff and officers and infrastructure.

In tune with that the envisaged Women Police Station (WPS), the WPS in Visakhapatnam is likely to be upgraded as ‘Disha Police Station’ with additional infrastructure very soon.

The WPS will be moved to a new building that is coming up near Yendada to accommodate the required strength, said Commissioner of Police R.K. Meena.

Apart from increasing the strength of the Women Police Station, the officers and staff will get and increase in pay by 30%, to act as a motivational gesture, he said.

It is learnt that the special police station will have a peoples friendly look with counsellors and will be under the control of a DSP or ACP rank officer. The proposal is to have at least three inspectors and five sub-inspectors under the ACP and about 30 constables, said a senior police officer.

All the staff will be trained to handle evidences efficiently using scientific methods from the crime scene, he added.

168,2020/01/19,52 lakh children in State to be given polio vaccine,"Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will launch a Statewide polio immunisation drive on January 19, under which 52.30 lakh children below five years of age will be administered polio drops.

The CM will launch the immunisation drive at his Tadepalli camp office at 10.45 a.m. on Sunday.

National Health Mission, A.P., Programme Manager K. Appa Rao told The Hindu that 1.50 lakh health personnel and volunteers have been deployed to administer the polio drops at 37,493 booths across the State.

The volunteers will go door-to-door from January 20 to 22 to ensure that every child is vaccinated.

Personnel and volunteers have been trained to administer the oral polio vaccines jointly by the Women and Child Welfare, Municipal Administration, MEPMA, Power Supply, Panchayat Raj, Tribal Welfare, Transport and Education departments, Mr. Appa Rao said.

65.75 lakh doses

As many as 65.75 lakh bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine (bOPV) doses have been stocked for the four-day drive. Altogether 1,354 mobile teams would cover high-risk areas (where there are migrants from different States and regions), railway stations, bus stands and children on the move with their parents.

According to a preliminary survey, 93,430 children have been identified at vulnerable locations (slums, construction sites, locations where migratory agriculture and fishermen community reside).

Andhra Pradesh has been polio-free for the past eleven years. The last polio case in Andhra Pradesh was reported in East Godavari in July 2008. The State has maintained international standards of polio surveillance for over 20 years, Mr. Appa Rao said.

Misconceptions

Some parents were found to be deliberately not vaccinating their newborns because of misplaced fears, Mr. Appa Rao said. He added that such fears have no place in today’s society and urged parents to vaccinate their children without fail.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/52-lakh-children-in-state-to-be-given-polio-vaccine/article30596503.ece
169,2020/01/19,‘Need an institution to shore up linguistic scholarship’,"To shore up linguistic scholarship there is an urgent need to set up a school of languages or some such institution akin to that and either the government, universities or prestigious institutions should initiate the task, Dupati (Emesco) Vijay Kumar has suggested.

Addressing a gathering after receiving the 16th annual literary award of Lok Nayak Foundation (LNF) here on Saturday, he said scholarship was in decline and the ability to restore an ancient text by scrutinising it was on the wane in Telugu society. To restore it, after Class V students should be taught English, Telugu and Sanskrit exclusively for 10 years.

Mr. Vijay Kumar suggested that people like Yarlagadda Lakshmi Prasad, Chairman of Official Language Commission and president of LNF, who is close to the Chief Minister should take it up and universities and educationalists like Lavu Rathaiah, who received the Lifetime Achievement Award should also think about it.

Andhra Pradesh High Court Judges A.V. Sesha Sai and K. Vijayalakshmi presented the awards to Mr. Vijay Kumar and Chairman of Vignan Group of Institutions Rathaiah.

Mr. Sesha Sai underlined the importance of mother tongue and literature and arts as they kindle goodness and humanitarian values and foster an atmosphere of peace. The greatness of Telugu was acknowledged by Tamil scholars like Appayya Deekshitulu and Subrahmanya Bharati, he recalled. He lauded the consistent service of Dr. Lakshmi Prasad to Telugu, arts and culture.

The literary award comprising ₹2 lakh and the lifetime award ₹1 lakh are presented every year on January 18 commemorating the death anniversary of former Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao and poet Harivanshrai Bachchan.

Justice Vijayalakshmi said presenting the awards to two persons who hailed from literary and education fields was eminently justified. Recalling the values fostered by NTR, she said he spotted his guru who was instrumental in his love of Telugu language at film function, paid his respects and seated him in the first row.

Mr. Rathaiah suggested people who were rendering noble services to the orphans or other sections of society should be identified and honoured by LNF. He traced his fame to his struggle to earn a living but said he never compromised on values.

Prof. Lakshmi Prasad lauded the vision of Mr. Rathaiah and the publishing record of Mr. Vijay Kumar during the past three decades.

170,2020/01/19,The triumvirate reminiscence about their association,"Political rivals sharing a dais to display camaraderie in public may be a rarity in present times given the toxicity generated because of ideological differences. On Sunday, however, Congress leader and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa and the former MLA A.H. Vishwanath not only shared a dais but also reminisced their association. They just stopped short of heaping praise on one another.

The occasion was the unveiling of a statue of Sangolli Rayanna at Doddakoppalu village in K.R. Nagar taluk of Mysuru district. The three leaders inaugurated the function by lighting the lamp and then took turns to speak. Perhaps sensing the bewilderment of the gathering over them being together at the event, Mr. Siddaramaiah, Mr. Eshwarappa, and Mr. Vishwanath said they were not enemies but only political rivals.

Mr. Siddaramaiah said he and Mr. Vishwanath have a long association since student days. “We studied law in a private college in Mysuru and I was in the final year and Mr. Vishwanath was in the first year of the course. We floated an organisation called Kalidasa Vidyarthi Sangha and I became its president and Mr. Vishwanath was its general secretary,” recalled Mr. Siddaramaiah, pointing out that they wanted to assist Kuruba community students.

“There is no enmity between us and all rivalry is purely political,” said Mr. Siddaramaiah. What matters was human relationship, he added, and reiterated that there was no personal enmity between them.

‘It’s all politics’

“Neither Mr. Vishwanath nor I have any property dispute to fight it over personally. It is all politics. He is in the BJP and I am in the Congress and I strive to ensure his defeat in elections and he does the same. But otherwise, we are not sworn enemies,” said the former Chief Minister.

Speaking in a similar tone, Mr. Eshwarappa recalled that he and Mr. Siddaramaiah had attended many functions and shared the dais during Kempe Gowda Jayanti, Ambedkar Jayanti, and Ramanujacharya Jayanti, and said there was nothing wrong in it.

“I had been highly critical of Mr. Siddaramaiah when he was the Chief Minister and he too has criticised me. We used to slug it out in the Assembly, but follow it up with a tea in the Speaker’s chamber,” said Mr. Eshwarappa.

On his part, Mr. Vishwanath said the contribution of Mr. Siddaramaiah to the development of Nandagad, where Sangolli Rayanna was hanged, was immense.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/f4ojfh/article30601955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGSIDDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/the-triumvirate-reminiscence-about-their-association/article30601956.ece
171,2020/01/19,Yediyurappa: Cabinet expansion two days after returning from Davos,"The vexed issue of Cabinet expansion continues to dog the BJP government even as Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa left Bengaluru on Sunday morning to Davos, Switzerland, to attend the World Economic Forum. Hours before leaving, the Chief Minister said the Cabinet would be expanded within two days after his return from Davos.

“A decision has been made to expand the Cabinet in a day or two after my return to Bengaluru,” Mr. Yediyurappa, who is leading the State team, including Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, told reporters. He is scheduled to return to Bengaluru on January 24.

The Chief Minister said he had held a discussion on Cabinet expansion with Union Home Minister and BJP national president Amit Shah. “I received positive response from Mr. Shah during the talks and the Cabinet will be expanded in two days after my return,” he said.

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said the Cabinet expansion had been delayed a bit owing to lack of clarity and need for further discussion on the issue.

“The Cabinet will be expanded after the Chief Minister’s return,” he said. He said the decision on the post of Deputy Chief Minister would be taken by the party’s central leadership and the Chief Minister.

On new entrants

In Mysuru, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa told reporters that the BJP would not have secured a majority in the Assembly had it not been for the new entrants, who quit the erstwhile coalition government and their respective parties and joined the BJP. “So, it is our duty to repay their debt,” he said.

When asked whether all the new entrants, including A.H. Vishwanath and N. Nagaraju (MTB) who lost the Assembly byelections, would be accommodated in the ministry, Mr. Eshwarappa said he was not aware about it. He said the party was duty-bound to keep the new entrants satisfied. “I am not saying that they should be made Ministers or Deputy Chief Ministers. But, they should be kept satisfied,” he said.

He said he was hopeful about the State having a full team of Ministers soon. Admitting that there was pressure to accommodate the new entrants in the ministry, Mr. Eshwarappa said a solution would be found for the prevailing confusion in the next two to three days and the Cabinet would be expanded soon thereafter.

He attributed “confusion” as the reason for the party failing to reach a majority in the Assembly elections in 2018. But the people voted in favour of a stable government under the BJP in the recent byelections, he maintained.

‘Delay not affecting development works’

Mr. Eshwarappa on Sunday sought to clarify that the delay in expanding the State Cabinet had not affected development works.

Despite the State seeing unprecedented floods, the government faced the situation and ensured that the affected people were provided relief. He accused the Congress of indulging in “anti-people” activities, besides pitting religions and castes against each other. He hit back at the Congress for criticising the BJP’s failure to have a full complement of Ministers even six months after forming the government. “Did the Congress fill all the 34 ministerial berths? They also did not do it till the end of the party government’s term,” Mr. Eshwarappa said.

Instead of criticising the BJP government for the delay in expanding the Ministry, the Congress should bother about having a president for its State and national units. “How many days has it been since Dinesh Gundu Rao resigned as president of the KPCC,” he asked.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ydj4lw/article30601907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THYEDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappa-cabinet-expansion-two-days-after-returning-from-davos/article30601908.ece
172,2020/01/19,Vijayapura DC to issue order on helmets for goverment workers,"Expressing concern over increasing road fatalities owing to people not wearing helmets, Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil has said that soon an order would be issued making it mandatory for government employees and parents to wear helmets while dropping their children at school.

Speaking at the valedictory programme of the 31st National Safety Day on Saturday, he said though there is a law to this effect, many people are not following it. “Wearing helmets is not to avoid police action, but primarily for the safety of people. When people do not care about their own safety, rules need to be framed.”

Mr. Patil said that based on the request of the Superintendent of Police, Prakash Nikam, he would be issuing the order to all government employees.

Expressing regret that many people violate safety rules and perform stunts on their motorcycles, which could lead to fatal accidents, he said that they should not do anything that puts their life in danger. “You may be doing such acts to generate excitement, but the consequences could be fatal. You have a bright career ahead of you... you should act responsibly. Think about your parents before attempting adventures which could turn into misadventures,” he said.

In his address, Mr. Nikam said that on an average, one person dies in Vijayapura district daily in fatal road accidents because of lack of helmet.

Announcing this at a press conference here on Sunday, BJP State general secretary N. Ravi Kumar said the party cadre would unfurl the tricolour in all the 58,000 booths of the State and take up the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in those meetings. All elected representatives would participate in this event that will also mark the end of the party’s outreach programme.

He said the BJP would also utilise the occasion to expose the Congress’ alleged “politics of negativism, duplicity and hypocrisy” on the issue of the CAA.

174,2020/01/19,KFD vaccination: elected representatives being involved to kill misconceptions,"The Department of Health and Family Welfare has involved elected representatives in its drive to remove misconceptions about the vaccination for combating Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) and to create awareness about its importance.

Owing to fears that the KFD vaccine will result in impotence, loss of hair and muscle pain, many people in rural areas have been showing reluctance to get themselves vaccinated. Hoovamma, a 58-year-old woman from Seegemakki village in Tumari Gram Panchayat limits, who passed away owing to KFD recently, was one such victim of misconception. Though the department had launched a vaccination drive at Seegemakki, she refused to take the shot.

Rajesh Suragihalli, District Health Officer, told The Hindu that to clear such misconceptions, local elected representatives are being brought on board to create awareness among people about the importance of the vaccination.

Leading by example

At an awareness programme in Tumari recently, the vaccine was administered on the dais to H. Halappa, MLA for Sagar, and G.T. Sathyanarayana, president of the gram panchayat. Mr. Suragihalli said that this sent across the message that the vaccine was harmless. As many as 158 persons from Seegemakki, who had shown reluctance to get vaccinated, changed their minds after attending the programme. Now, all the residents there have been covered under the vaccination drive, he said.

The DHO also said that those who have missed taking vaccination in the affected areas would be counselled by the gram panchayat members, who will be trained in counselling by the department. In addition to this, a register containing information on the progress achieved under the vaccination drive will be maintained at the gram panchayat office, he added.

At schools in the affected areas, teachers will apprise the students of the importance of the vaccination. Mr. Suragihalli said such sessions have already been held at government schools in Tumari and Aralagodu GP limits in Sagar taluk.

Seven positive cases of KFD, including one fatal one, have been reported in the district since January 1.

175,2020/01/19,Thousands pay tribute to Shivakumara Swami on his first death anniversary,"Thousands of devotees offered prayers at the ‘Gadduge’ where Shivakumara Swami, the late seer of Siddaganga Mutt, was laid to rest on the mutt premises on Sunday. It was the first death anniversary of the seer.

Bhajans were sung at the Gadduge, which was decorated with flowers. Addressing a large gathering on the premises of the mutt, Minister for Kannada and Culture C.T. Ravi admitted that untouchability was still a reality in society and the caste system was weakening the nation.

He called upon people to once again be part of a social movement, like the one led by the 12th century social reformer Basavanna, to eradicate caste system and untouchability. The movement should change the mindset of people and promote universal brotherhood in society, he said.

Attacking the secular political parties, Mr. Ravi said, “It is unfortunate that the so-called secular people are the biggest casteists. If there is no caste system in the nation, such parties will not survive. And yet they claim to be secular.”

On Bharat Ratna

Meanwhile, the seer of Siddaganga Mutt, Siddalinga Swami, said that Shivakumara Swami was now living in the hearts of devotees and had become “Hrudaya Ratna”, and thus there was no need to posthumously confer the Bharat Ratna on him.

He said Shivakumara Swami never expected any awards or honours. “He just worked for the poor by providing free education, free food and free boarding to students, irrespective of their caste and religion, and provided food to all the devotees who visited the mutt.”

Industrialist Mukesh Garg and Maninderjeet Singh Bitta (M.S. Bitta), who is the chairman of the All-India Anti-Terrorist Front, were felicitated at the event. Mr. Garg donated a silver idol of Shivakumara Swami weighing 50 kg to the mutt.

176,2020/01/19,CID takes over investigation of Mangaluru violence,"The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has taken over the investigation into the violence and police firing that left two dead in Mangaluru on December 19. A protest over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, amid prohibitory orders, had turned violent near the office of the Deputy Commissioner and in Bunder area last month.

A team of eight officials, headed by Superintendent of Police (Special Inquiries) Rahul Shahapurwad, is investigating 24 cases of rioting, unlawful assembly, and assault on public servants registered in the Mangaluru South and Mangaluru North police stations. Of these, 11 have been registered in North station. The team officially took over the investigation on January 17. A notification asking the CID to take over the probe was issued on January 10.

Udupi Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha is conducting a magisterial inquiry into the police firing. The CID is probing the 24 cases, including the police firing.

The city police have sourced CCTV camera footage and videos of the violence to arrest a few persons allegedly involved in rioting. A team of city police analysed mobile tower dumps of places of violence and issued notice to around 600 people from Kasaragod district in Kerala. They have been asked to appear before the Mangaluru North police and give statements as police suspect their involvement in unlawful assembly and rioting on December 19. Among these people are women and patients who had come to the city for treatment.

177,2020/01/19,Move to remove leasing curbs in Karnataka based on NITI Aayog model,"The State government’s move to amend Section 5 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961 is based on the Model (Agricultural) Land Leasing Act, 2016 proposed by the Centre’s think tank NITI Aayog to increase investments in agriculture and productivity.

The proposed legislation envisages legalising lease transactions of agricultural land, and the government will not interfere in the lease amount or tenure that the farmer may agree upon with individuals, groups or corporate entities.

The Revenue Department’s argument is that the present land reforms law needs to be tweaked under the changed circumstances. While it was brought in to address the issue of absentee landlords and tenancy — both major problems of the time — the agriculture sector now requires a push in terms of investments and modernisation. This is not forthcoming because of small holdings. Incidentally, the average land holding in Karnataka is about 1.2 hectares.

“Leasing will be primarily aimed at allowing agriculture and allied activities on farmlands that have now been left fallow for various reasons, The leased land cannot be diverted for any other purpose,” a source said, adding that the local tahsildar would be involved in the process.

According to Revenue Department sources, to circumvent the law at present, many farmers enter into mortgage agreements with those interested in cultivating their land. “Not only have mortgage arrangements led to legal disputes, sometimes even over ownership of the land, they have also resulted in land owners receiving the crop compensation in case of crop failure,” the source said.

The benefits

Sources defended the government move, saying that the new Act could be beneficial to all. “On the one hand, new investments can come into the sector and improve productivity, and on the other, it will enable gainful utilisation of fallow land. A person who is interested in agriculture but does not have enough money to purchase land can practise agriculture by leasing the land at a fraction of the cost. Once leasing is legalised, the person taking the land on lease will be eligible for bank loan, input subsidy and compensation for crop loss.”

The flip side

A section of Revenue Department officials believe that removing restrictions on leasing agricultural land would be a big blow to the Land Reforms Act.

They said the amendment to Section 79 A and B brought in by the Siddaramaiah government to enhance the annual income limit of those intending to purchase agricultural land from ₹2 lakh to ₹25 lakh was the first dilution. The Act will lose relevance further if restrictions on leasing are removed, and it will open the floodgates to corporates to enter the agriculture sector.

“Land holdings are small and a large number of people are still dependent on them for their livelihood. The security for small farmers could be seriously compromised by this move,” an official said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1flo5x/article30601779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGAGRICULTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/move-to-remove-leasing-curbs-in-karnataka-based-on-niti-aayog-model/article30601780.ece

He said leaders should avoid repeating politically motivated statements on the Karnataka–Maharashtra border issue.

179,2020/01/19,"Four working presidents in KPCC will ensure regional, caste balance: Satish Jarkiholi","Confirming the proposal to create four posts of working president in the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC), the former Minister Satish Jarkiholi on Sunday said the move was aimed at ensuring regional and caste balance.

Mr. Jarkiholi, who is considered to be in the race for the post, told reporters that a clear picture about the constitution of additional posts of working president in the KPCC would emerge in a week. He attributed the delay to the upcoming elections to the Delhi Assembly.

Mr. Jarkiholi denied that the Congress was riven by factions representing “migrants” and the original or loyal partymen.

He said leaders like him had joined the party 10 years ago and any discussion on the topic of migrants was irrelevant and unnecessary. Mr. Jarkiholi said he had favoured the appointment of one person to the posts of the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and the Congress Legislature Party leader.

Referring to speculation over the imminent induction of new entrants to the BJP, including his brother Ramesh Jarkiholi, into the B.S. Yediyurappa ministry, Mr. Satish Jarkiholi said a few MLAs had been waiting to become Ministers ever since the 2018 Assembly elections.

Right from the day the coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy was sworn in, these leaders were plotting to bring down the regime and become Ministers, he said.

At a press conference here on Friday, D.G. Sagar, president of the organisation, said they would mobilise the people to make the rally a success. “People all over the country are coming out in droves to oppose the CAA and the NRC. Yet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have not heard the people’s voices. We have to continue to protest till the government repeals the CAA and drops the NRC,” he said.

Terming the CAA and the NRC as anti-people, Mr. Sagar said the move would affect not just Muslims, as some people thought or were trying to project, but the poor and deprived sections of all communities such as Dalits, Adivasis and Backward Classes.

“One should be clear that the Aadhaar, EPIC or PAN cards are not enough to prove one’s citizenship in the NRC process. If these documents are valid for proving your citizenship, then the need for NRC would have not arisen and it could have been prepared form the database that the government already had. The government going in for NRC means that one needs to provide land-holding documents and birth certificates of one’s parents. There are 30 crore people who don’t own land. There are more than two crore people who don’t own houses. There are 15 crore belonging to nomadic tribes that don’t have any documents. There are 8.43 crore Adivasis who don’t have any records.

Suresh Kumar, Minister for Primary and Secondary Education, said the opinion of stakeholders in the field of education – teachers, students, academicians and parents – would be elicited on the prevailing system of allocating ranks to districts for SSLC and II PU result.

He was speaking to presspersons after inaugurating a programme marking the centenary year of government higher primary school in Chikkamagadi village in Shikaripur taluk on Saturday. He said the existing system of allocation of ranks to districts on the basis of pass percentage in SSLC and PU result should not be considered infallible. It is a known fact that, it is not possible to assess the level of comprehension and learning of students in this system. The possibility of evolving a more scientific method of analysing academic progress needs to be contemplated, he said.

Referring to the debate on the ranking system, he said that while a section of teachers felt it was necessary to maintain a competitive spirit between districts, there was also the opinion that it was not the right method of analysing academic performance. The State government would take a call on the abolition of ranking system after eliciting the opinion of the stakeholders, he said.

He said measures would be taken to provide uniforms and text books to students of government schools in the first week of June. B.Y. Raghavendra, Shivamogga MP was present.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/system-of-district-rank-allocation-based-on-pass-percentage-not-infallible/article30598756.ece
184,2020/01/19,Call to include youth outside formal education system on electoral roll,"Sanjiv Kumar, Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer, stressed upon the need to enrol youth who have remained outside the formal education system, on the electoral roll. He was speaking at a meeting at the Deputy Commissioner’s office here on Saturday to review the progress of revision of electoral roll in the district.

He said that, as part of the exercise of revision of electoral roll, apart from door-to-door visits for new enrolment, awareness sessions are held at college campuses. Many youth have not enrolled for college. Officials should compare the data with Department of Public Instruction on students who have completed high school and with the Department of PU Education on those who have enrolled for PUC to identify the students and take necessary measures to enlist them on the voters’ list, he said.

Referring to the skewed sex ratio of voters in Sorab taluk where there are 970 women voters for every 1,000 male voters, he directed the officials to probe into the reason and submit a report. Cautioning that deletion of names in the voters’ list without conducting spot inspection may lead to confusion, he directed booth-level officers to personally visit houses that has names to be deleted from the list.

K.B. Sivakumar, DC, said the total population of the district is 18,49,262, of which 14,38,694 names are enrolled that meaning enrolment is at 77.29%, he said.

185,2020/01/19,Smart City Ltd. says it will complete Town Hall underpass by May,"Notwithstanding the delay in commencing civil work for the pedestrian underpass between Mini Vidhana Soudha and Town Hall beneath Maidan Road, Mangalore Smart City Ltd., (MSCL) is confident of completing the ₹6 crore project before the onset of the monsoon.

While the carriageway from A.B. Shetty Circle to Clock Tower was closed for traffic from November 28, no civil work, except the earth work, has commenced so far. Traffic on this stretch has been diverted via Hamilton Circle-Rao and Rao Circle as well as Service Bus Stand Road even as motorists have been criticising the delay in completion of the project.

Charles Lobo, who regularly commutes on his car between Morgan’s Gate and K.S. Rao Road, said crossing Nehru Maidan area has become a nightmare during peak hours. The stretch from Hamilton Circle to Rao and Rao Circle and then till Clock Tower on Bibi Alabi Road/Maidan Road is packed with buses and hawkers. Though potholes and craters on the Service Bus Stand Road are filled, the road remains bumpy because of haphazard work, he lamented.

Mohammed Nazeer, MD, MSCL, however said the actual civil work could not be taken up following the presence of huge bunch of utility cables — telephone and power — on the stretch. “Though we knew their presence beforehand, time was required to shift them,” he told The Hindu.

Mangalore Electricity Supply Company had to shift a 33 kV underground cable supplying power to Forum Fiza Mall. The challenge was the presence of over 50 telephone cables, each with an average 1,200 connections catering to various government and private offices in the Central Business District, belonging to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd., he said.

BSNL had to lay new cables first and cut the old ones before establishing connections to new ones. Only about two cables could be taken up in a day so as not to hamper telephone/broadband connections in the region, he explained.

Shifting of cables is now complete and actual civil works, including construction of a concrete box would soon commence. By March-end, the carriageway would be restored and work beneath the other carriageway would be undertaken. At any cost, the underpass should be ready before the end of May, he said.

Gandhi Park to be spruced up

Gandhi Park in front of Town Hall where the pedestrian underpass connecting Mini Vidhana Soudha and Town Hall beneath Maidan Road opens up, will be spruced up by Mangalore Smart City Ltd.

Besides improving the landscape of the park, the intention was to have regular footfalls in the area so as to discourage nuisance for underpass users, said Chandrakanth Bannoth, MSCL’s Executive Engineer. The presence of people with seating arrangements to relax in the park would discourage nuisance-makers from indulging in other activities, he explained.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xc865n/article30597019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18MNPEDESTRIANUNDERPASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/smart-city-ltd-says-it-will-complete-town-hall-underpass-by-may/article30597020.ece
186,2020/01/19,Kerala mosque hosts a Hindu wedding,"In a show of communal amity, the Cheravally Muslim Jamaath Committee, Kayamkulam, on January 19 hosted a Hindu wedding on the mosque premises.

Sarath Sasi of Krishnapuram and Anju Ashok of Cheravally tied the knot as per Hindu rituals in front of lit traditional lamps. The marriage was solemnised by a Hindu priest.

The Jamaath committee had decked up the place for the function. Members of both the Hindu and Muslim communities turned out in large numbers to witness the marriage. Apart from hosting the wedding, the mosque committee served a vegetarian ‘sadya’ to around 1,000 guests. As part of gifts, Ms. Anju was given 10 sovereigns of gold and ₹2 lakh.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan termed the wedding “an example of unity from Kerala”. He tweeted: “Congratulations to the newlyweds, families, mosque authorities and people of Cheravally”.

The bride had lost her father a couple of years ago. As the family lacked resources to conduct the wedding, Ms. Anju’s mother sought the help of the mosque committee. “She came to my house seeking help for conducting the marriage. She gave a letter, which I presented to the Jamaath committee. We decided to help the family conduct the marriage,” said Nujumudeen Alummoottil, secretary, Cheravally Muslim Jamaath Committee.

Bindu Ashok, mother of Ms. Anju, said the family was thankful to the Jamaath Committee.

187,2020/01/19,Cat stranded atop Metro pillar rescued after five days in Kochi,"A cat’s escapade atop a Kochi Metro pillar and its dramatic rescue brought much of Sahodaran Ayyappan Road to a standstill on Sunday afternoon.

Bijoy K. Peter, an officer of the Fire and Rescue Services, which was assigned on Sunday morning to rescue the cat, remained crouched atop the Metro pillar near Vyttila Junction for about an hour before it could be coaxed out of its spot on the pillar.

As the fire services ladder fell way short, Kochi Metro Rail Ltd. supplied a man lift crane that carried two more officers to the top of the pillar. Manoeuvres from the crane to get the cat into a net failed, and the animal was forced out of its hiding place and pushed straight into a safety net stretched several feet below by animal lovers. A loud cheer from onlookers erupted.

“The cat was scared and would run into corners. It was like working in a small tunnel-like space because my movement on the pillar was severely restricted,” Mr. Peter said.

The added fear that it might climb onto the electrified Metro line kept the personnel on their toes since the trains continued to ply right above.

Five days ago, Rennan Pillai, who runs a store near Vyttila Junction, heard the mewling of a cat, but failed to spot it anywhere at the ground level. A chance glance upwards and he found it perched on a Metro pillar nearby.

“I called the Fire and Rescue Services that day, but they said they rarely carried out animal rescue services anymore. A media report on Sunday morning might have prompted the rescue,” Mr. Rennan said.

Despite its five-day ordeal and exciting fall from a height, the cat was healthy and taken to a vet. How the animal landed on the pillar remains a mystery.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iohk8k/article30602382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20TVKICAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/the-meow-that-kept-kochi-riveted-for-hours/article30602081.ece
188,2020/01/19,Syro-Malabar Church reiterates allegations on ‘planned affairs’,"The synod of bishops of the Syro-Malabar Church has stood firm in its allegations about the occurrences of “inter-religious” love affairs targeted at Christian girls that “tend to endanger religious amity and societal peace”.

It is a fact that such “planned” affairs, targeted at Christian girls, had taken place.

That Christian girls had been recruited into the IS terrorist organisation “should open our eyes”, said a circular issued by the bishops that was read out at many parishes of the Syro-Malabar Church during the course of the mass on Sunday.

The circular was officially issued at the end of the first session of the 28th synod of the bishops here last week and was meant to be read out during the Sunday Mass.

However, some parishes did not read out the circular because they either celebrated the feast of St. Sebastian on Sunday or the parish authorities had not received the copies of the circular, claimed the official spokesman for the Syro-Malabar church here on Sunday.

He said that it was not because of the opposition to the content of the circular that it was not read out in some parishes.

Strong opposition

The clarification came in the wake of opposition to the “love jihad” allegations made by the bishops in their circular after the synod.

Kuriakose Mundadan, senior priest of the Syro-Malabar archdiocese of Ernakulam-Angamaly, had expressed his opposition to the reference.

So did Almaya Munnettam, a group within the Syro-Malabar Church calling for reforms and transparency in the administration.

The ‘love jihad’ allegation was being raised to divert attention from the internal affairs of the Syro-Malabar church, claimed Almaya Munnettam convener Binju John and spokesman Riju Kanjookkaran.

When issues such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was being discussed, live allegations had been mistimed, they alleged.

Meanwhile, the Joint Christian Council has said that attempts by Cardinal George Alencherry, head of the Syro-Malabar Church, to use church members as “commodity for sale” would be resisted strongly.

The Cardinal’s circular alleging ‘love jihad’ only exposed his grovelling before the Bharatiya Janata Party, said the council in a statement issued here on Sunday.

The Cardinal’s attempt to surrender the Catholic church before “communal organisations” such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) would not be successful, the council statement added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/afdl4w/article30467648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvchurch,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/syro-malabar-church-reiterates-allegations-on-planned-affairs/article30602032.ece
189,2020/01/19,CPI(M) call puts Cong. in a bind,"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) central committee’s call on Sunday for an intense and collective movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, has virtually put the Congress and United Democratic Front (UDF) leadership in a bind.

The Congress and the UDF that had shied away from joint protests with the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in the initial phase owing to political compulsions within the party and the front will now have to augment their own protests and also adequately explain the reason for ploughing its own burrow.

The anti-CAA protests across the country had a unique nature. Most of them erupted spontaneously with students and youth in the forefront.

Instead of vying with others to appropriate space for gaining political mileage, the Left parties and others have chosen to lend support to the protest. This experiment seems to have helped catalyse the movement and also prompted 20 parties to come forward to organise joint protests.

The CPI(M) central committee meeting that concluded here on Sunday has also unequivocally said that the anti-CAA platform need not be construed as a formation for fighting future elections and it was only a pivot for coordinating the ongoing agitations.

Cohesive movement

The central committee went a step ahead and clarified that considering the regional political complexities in each State, it may not be imperative for all parties to come together under one platform for a united fight.

Those reluctant to join the stream could have their own programmes too. But it has also underlined the need for a cohesive movement that would lend more vigour to the protests.

An all-party meeting held at the behest of the government had entrusted Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala to chart out a future course of action.

But that proposal remains stillborn in the face of resistance from the Congress and the UDF allies.

The CPI(M) call for unified protests is unlikely to elicit a positive response from the Opposition, especially before the human chain the LDF had planned to form on January 26, but the current trend indicates that the stir is set to intensify in the days ahead.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-call-puts-cong-in-a-bind/article30602018.ece
190,2020/01/19,CPI(M) to launch door-to-door campaign against NPR,"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) central committee has decided to launch a ‘No to NPR’ campaign and door-to-door drive asking people to reject questions from Census personnel on NPR.

Briefing reporters about the deliberations of a three-day central committee meeting that concluded here on Sunday, general secretary Sitaram Yechury said that the door-to-door campaign was aimed at creating public awareness about the link between National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) and educate them on the need to reject questions on NPR. The meeting demanded that the Centre repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019.

Since the Census procedures were set to be launched on April 10, the meeting decided to complete the entire campaign by March 23, marking the martyrdom of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru, and Sukhdev.

Readings of the Preamble of the Constitution will be held on January 26 and campaign for promoting communal harmony will be conducted on January 30.

The meeting demanded that the Centre repeal the directions to State governments to construct detention centres and dismantle the existing centres in Assam.

The committee expressed its strong disapproval of the statement of Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) Bipin Rawat that ‘de-radicalisation camps’ are needed for children who are being radicalised, particularly in Kashmir. “Shockingly, he indicated that such camps are already functioning. The Modi government must immediately clarify if such camps exist in Jammu and Kashmir. The CDS must clarify if such camps are being set up and run at the initiative of the Army,” Mr. Yechury said.

The meeting demanded the restoration of Statehood of Kashmir and lifting of curbs imposed on the State, release of detained political leaders, and restoration of the Internet.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/t0z7oh/article30602000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20TVTVCAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cpim-to-launch-door-to-door-campaign-against-npr/article30602001.ece
191,2020/01/19,Kerala Food Platform from this week,"The Kerala Food Platform (KFP), a futuristic concept that could take the production and availability of safe-to-eat, organic food in the State to the next level, will be launched here this week.

It seeks to bring multiple stakeholders in the agricultural ecosystem on a digital platform, enabling production and delivery using digitally enabled models.

Conceived by the Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-DISC), the KFP will be launched by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan at the Sahakarana Bhavan on Thursday. Modelled on the digital food platform in Dubai, but tweaked to fit local needs, the KFP revolves around emerging global trends in the food sector such as growing demand for healthy food and traceability in food. K-DISC worked with SunTec, which had worked on the UAE project, to evolve the Kerala model.

“It is a mechanism for food security,” Unnikrishnan P.V., strategic advisor, K-DISC, said. “We see a lot of ‘platformisation’ in models like Uber. The benefits of multiple players coming together on a single platform is non-linear and distinct from direct trade. Eventually we want to bring on board all the farmers and a large number of customers,” he said.

The KFP seeks to plug gaps and ensure a higher income for the farmer, and satisfaction for the consumer while building better trust among stakeholders.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-food-platform-from-this-week/article30601840.ece

194,2020/01/19,Congress should think on its own: Jairam Ramesh,"The Congress’ politics cannot be dictated by the CPI(M), feels party MP and former Minister Jairam Ramesh.

“The Congress should not outsource its thinking. It should think on its own,” he said when asked about the party’s role in the ongoing protests against the National Democratic Alliance government, on Sunday. He was talking to a section of the media on the sidelines of the Kerala Literature Festival.

“The Congress has to fight the BJP… There is a BJP trap and a CPI(M) trap, you should avoid both traps,” Mr. Ramesh said. Being a national party, the Congress would have to look at national politics. “Pinarayi Vijayan only looks at Kerala politics. Sitaram Yechury looks at national politics and he has more influence on the Congress than the CPI(M). It is easier for CPI(M) leaders to meet Rahul Gandhi than Congress leaders,” he claimed. Mr. Ramesh said that the CPI(M) was relevant only in one State, but the Congress was relevant in 29 States.

Sensitive issue

The Congress leader said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was a sensitive issue, but the Gross Domestic Product was more important than the CAA and the National Population Register. “The most important issue in India today is economic crisis. Inflation is going up, growth is coming down. Jobs are stagnant, they are being lost. Nobody is talking about it,” he said.

“The BJP wants to keep the debate on the CAA and the NPR. The Congress should lead an agitation on economic crisis, not the CAA or the NPR because economic crisis is not a Hindu-Muslim issue, it affects everybody, whereas people see NPR as a Hindu-Muslim issue,” he said. Mr. Ramesh said that the Congress had to learn to deal with regional parties. They want respect and dignity. “Congress made a mistake in 2009. In 2004, the United Progressive Alliance won and the Congress took all coalition parties together. In 2009, we got 200-odd seats and became very arrogant. There was no Common Minimum Programme in 2009. The BJP is making the same mistake with the regional parties now,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4fy0ys/article30601801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20TVJAIRAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/congress-should-think-onits-own-jairam-ramesh/article30601795.ece

196,2020/01/19,State government puts on hold Open University of Kerala move,"Objections raised by the influential lobby of parallel colleges appears to have prompted the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government to slow pedal on its avowed stance of establishing an Open university in the State.

With time running out for the government to meet its target of operationalising the proposed Open University of Kerala (OUK) by the next academic year, academicians fear the State might squander yet another opportunity to realise its dream that has been in the pipeline as early as 1983.

The varsity was among the promises made by the Left Democratic Front (LDF) in its pre-poll manifesto.

Based on a comprehensive report submitted by noted academician J. Prabash, who was designated the special officer for the endeavour, Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel had declared that the OUK would come into being from the 2020-21 academic year.

Distance learning

It was also recommended to instruct the existing universities to discontinue offering programmes through the distance and private registration modes.

Currently, the Kerala, Calicut and Kannur Universities offer 17 UG, 16 PG and two certificate courses in the distance mode. While the Mahatma Gandhi and Kerala Universities enable students to enrol for UG courses through private registration, only the former offers the opportunity to pursue PG courses in the mode.

In the 2018-19 academic year alone, 93,155 students enrolled for distance education courses and 25,488 registered through the private mode. The move to subsume private registrations had irked parallel college managements which had launched a series of demonstrations across the State.

Recently, the Parallel College Association sought the intervention of the Governor, Chief Minister and leaders of various political parties to reconsider the move.

Affecting students

According to Jiji Varghese, State president of the association, the government’s decision to do away with private registrations could affect nearly 1.25 lakh students, most of those who hailed from economically-disadvantaged sections, who depended upon parallel colleges for higher studies.

Moreover, around 25,000 workers, including teachers, of the 700-odd parallel colleges in the State would be rendered unemployed.

He added that the uncertainty over recognition of certificates issued by an Open university could also prompt job-seekers to pursue courses in other States.

The complexities associated with redeploying the teachers of distance education programmes to the proposed varsity or retaining them in the parent universities is also believed to have created a predicament.

UGC criterion

Currently, none of the four universities satisfied the University Grants Commission’s (UGC) criterion of having National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) accreditation of A+ grade with a minimum CGPA of 3.26 on a four-point scale to offer open and distance learning programmes.

“The universities have been conducting these courses on short-term exemptions. The deficiency could come to haunt us if we failed to establish the OUK before the UGC decided to strictly enforce its norms. Concerns regarding the validity of certificates issued by the university could be resolved by taking up the issue with the agencies concerned,” a source said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-government-puts-on-hold-open-university-of-kerala-move/article30601766.ece

198,2020/01/19,Theatre of Quietude: Poignant tales told by silences,"Stories told by embodied silences. Phillip Zarilli, internationally well-known director, actor/performer, is inspired by the ‘Theatre of Quietude’, where there are no words, only subtle performances.

Told By the Wind, by Mr. Zarilli’s Llanarth Group, to be staged on the inaugural day of the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) on Monday, is a quiet sensory poetry, which will trigger the imagination of the audience.

“Told By the Wind is inspired by the notion of the word, quiet, which creates an opportunity for the audience to imaginatively enter into what is happening on the stage,” says Mr. Zarilli, who is an Emeritus Professor of Performance Practice at Exeter University in the U.K.

Passivity

“The basic principle of quietude is what the Japanese playwright Ota Shogo terms ‘the power of passivity’. Passivity in art refers to the making of aesthetic distance. Instead of trying to aggressively transmit meaning to the audience, passivity exercises a spirit of ‘self reliance’ that compels the audience to attend, focus and participate imaginatively in the pursuit of signification, meaning and pleasure. Thus passivity paradoxically engages the audience in a dynamic exchange of energy.”

Two figures, two lives and multiple time space — Told By the Wind is a new performance movement and text that dance in an inner space. Stories are evoked and told by embodied silences, splintered interactions and slowed down motion. It is a sensory engagement of the performer as he senses the wind.

“It is not a play, in the traditional sense. But a co-created performance. It is not obvious. There is no straight forward narration. It triggers the imagination of the viewers and give them scope to interpret in their own way,” Mr. Zarilli said.

Meditative

The 55-minute performance is intimate and meditative. It is a requiem for the unseen. The audience will be invited to slow down, listen and breathe with the performers, engaging in a process of dynamic imagining, in the midst of ‘quietude’.

Seven years in Kerala

203,2020/01/19,CAA petition in SC: Kerala Governor seeks report from LDF govt,"Kerala Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has sought a report from the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front government for moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship Amendment Act without informing him.

The office of Raj Bhavan sought the report from the Chief Secretary of the State.

“The Governor’s office has sought a report from the Chief Secretary for not informing him about the state’s move to approach the apex court against the CAA,” a top source from Raj Bhavan told PTI on Sunday.

The LDF government had on January 13 moved the top court challenging the Act and had sought to declare it as ultra vires of the Constitution.

Attacking Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, Mr. Khan had earlier said the public affairs and the business of the government cannot be run in accordance with the “whims of an individual or a political party” and everyone has to respect the rules.

Kerala was the first state to pass a resolution in the State Assembly against the CAA and to knock on the doors of the top court, challenging the new law.

The Governor, who has made his displeasure known public, had told reporters in Delhi that as per Rules of Business Section 34(2) sub section 5, the State government should inform the Governor on matters that affect the relations between the State and the Centre.

However, the State has maintained that it had not violated any rules and no deliberate attempts had been made to challenge the authority of the Governor’s office.

Law Minister A K Balan had said on Saturday that the government would clear all apprehensions raised by Khan.

A day after CPI(M) mouthpiece Deshabhimani attacked the Governor in a hard hitting editorial, party State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on Sunday accused Mr. Khan of unnecessarily interfering in the day-to-day affairs of the government.

“The Governor is defaming a State government which was elected by the people of the State. The post of Governor is not to defame the State government,” he said in an article in the party newspaper.

Meanwhile, Mr. Khan, who was scheduled to attend a public function at Kozhikode on Sunday, cancelled it, citing security reasons.

The Governor was scheduled to attend a session at the Kerala Literary Festival (KLF).

“The organisers told us it would be difficult for them to follow the security protocol for the Governor as the KLF is a function which is being attended by thousands of people. They requested us to change the date,” Raj Bhavan sources said.

There were reports suggesting that the Governor cancelled the event fearing protest from anti-CAA agitators at the literary function.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a6hmdf/article30600029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Kerala-Governor,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-governor-seeks-report-from-government-on-caa-suit-in-supreme-court/article30599483.ece

We then traced the identity of her husband by tracking the registration details of the car,” said an officer with the Adimaly police station. While collecting her statement, Ms. Lailamani told the police that she and her husband were on their way to their son’s residence at Erattayar, near Kattappana. “After reaching Adimaly, her husband got out of the car and did not return,” the official added.

Meanwhile, Lailamani’s son Manjith here on Saturday approached the police after coming to know about her ordeal from the media. Manjith, who is the elder son of Lailamani from her first marriage, currently resides at Kallar in Nedumkandam.

212,2020/01/19,It is the judiciary’s business to protect the Constitution: ex-judge,"“Over the last one month, thousands of protesters on the streets across the country have been reading the Preamble of the Constitution for the judiciary to hear. It is the judiciary’s business to protect the Constitution,” Justice K. Chandru, former Madras High Court Judge, said here on Saturday.

“It was a Supreme Court judgment which decided the definition of secularism, and it said that the State will not take sides,” he said, addressing the 9th annual Jesuit Alumni National Congress.

He said the SC judgment on the Ayodhya dispute was given as though it was a minor land dispute. “People who, for years, complained that matters of faith can’t be heard by the Supreme Court, celebrated the verdict,” he said.

Justice Chandru said recent incidents, including the decision to bring Delhi under the National Security Act, reminded him of the Emergency of 1975. “The then Attorney General wrote, saying that the freedom of expression and all other rights under the Constitution were suspended during the Emergency. Even leaders who hold high positions of power in the Cabinet now were detained for over a year during that time,” he said.

“If anyone asks for proof of one’s citizenship, ask them to read Article 5 of the Constitution,” he said.

Later in the day, Justice Chandru spoke on the challenges facing the Constitution at an event organised by Vaanam, a Tiruchi-based forum.

Condemning the State government and the police for coming down heavily on residents who drew kolams outside houses to express their opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Justice Chandru said the people understood the laws of the land better than the lawmakers.

Mr. Rao, also the city president of the party, accused the ruling partymen of colluding with land grabbers, encroaching into water bodies and public spaces like parks. Therefore, protection and improvement of parks, playgrounds and libraries are among the priorities for the BJP in the urban areas.

Provision of potable drinking water, preventive health, cleanliness and sanitation, integrated long term development plan with focus on improving upon the of backward areas, providing skill development and training centres to give a fillip to the small and medium scale enterprises for employment to the youth are among the assurances made in the manifesto.

The party has also promised computerisation of municipal records, toll free number for grievance redressal, especially those of land disputes, developing burial grounds, providing freezer vans, timely deliverance of certificates through the citizen service centres, pensions to the needy and so on.

Abhishek Reddy, said that police planted ‘some Maoist literature’ in his house and later showed it as ‘material recovered in the searches’.

The Bench noted that the professor’s case posed questions not only about an individual’s personal liberty but also the issue of protecting fundamental rights of a citizen. The matter also pertained to protection of institutions of higher learning from “being interfered by the State”, the order said.

Manner of arrest

The manner of arrests of ‘Maoist sympathisers’, timing (either at dead of night or at early hours) and their production ‘routinely’ before a magistrate raise concerns of the court. “A slim possibility does exist that human rights and constitutional mandates are being violated by the State”, the Bench said in the order. The Bench remarked that most of the detained persons in ‘Maoist sympathisers’ case alleged that Maoist literature was planted in their residences by the police.

Referring to the police claim that lot of Maoist literature was recovered from Mr. Kaseem’s house, the Bench said it was important to ascertain content and nature of the literature seized. It instructed the Police Department to indicate which books, pamphlets and documents the State had found objectionable. This was crucial because the arrested professor had been teaching Dalit and Revolutionary literature which question fundamental principles and beliefs of society, the order said.

‘Present evidence’

Referring to the remand report in which the police accused the professor of collecting money from businessmen and contractors and passing on it to the Maoist party, the Bench instructed Advocate General to present evidence before it on the matter. Evidence should also be furnished to substantiate the allegation that Mr. Kaseem participated in Maoist party meetings in Chhattisgarh State, the order said.

Lawyer V. Raghunath, who presented arguments in the habeas corpus petition, later told media persons that a bail petition seeking the professor’s release would be filed on Monday. He said the Bench had directed the authorities to consider the request of the professor for shifting him from Sangareddy prison to Cherlapally Central Prison.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/5r1hkt/article30601354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20KASIM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/professors-arrest-raises-concerns-if-state-is-silencing-dissent-voices-hc/article30601356.ece
218,2020/01/19,Why was Kaseem not held for 14 years: HC to Telangana govt.,"Observing that the case of arrested associate professor of Osmania University Chinthakindi Kaseem ‘acquired unique colour’, the Telangana High Court on Sunday directed the Advocate General to explain why the police failed to act against the professor in cases registered against him in 2012 and 2019.

A Bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy passed the direction, after hearing contentions of the counsels of the government and the professor for over two hours at CJ’s residence here at Banjara Hills. Following the Bench’s order in the Mr. Kaseem’s habeas corpus petition which was heard the previous day, the Mulugu Police of Siddipet Commissionerate brought him to the CJ’s residence amidst tight security.

After recording the arrested professor’s statement and contentions of both the sides, the Bench noted that it was ‘rather surprising that police had never moved against Mr. Kaseem for past 14 years despite accusing him of involvement in five criminal cases’. “It is only suddenly after the lapse of inordinate period of 14 years that the police has woken up to the threat posed by the professor both to society and to the State at large,” the Bench said in its order. According to the details presented by the police a case was first registered against Mr. Kaseem in 2006 at Amrabad in Nagarkurnool district.

Status sought

The Bench said Mr. Kaseem was not even aware of the three First Information Reports (FIRs) registered against him in 2016 and 2019, as the investigators never approached him on these matters. Expressing concern over this, the Bench instructed the AG to explain status of investigation in these three cases.

“Why the police has failed to take any action against the professor in these FIRs?” the Bench specifically wanted to know. Referring to police claim that 54 persons (including Mr. Kaseem and his wife) were made the accused in a case registered in 2016, the HC asked the police to inform exactly how many persons were arrested in that case.

‘Declared absconder’

As police declared Mr. Kaseem as an absconder in a case registered in 2016 (in which the Mulugu case arrested him now), the Bench asked what steps the police had taken to declare him as an absconding offender. Police were also instructed to present papers which were submitted to the lower court to declare him as an absconding offender.

The matter was posted to Friday for hearing, directing the AG to file a detailed counter affidavit by Thursday. Mr. Kaseem, who was already remanded in judicial custody by a magistrate, was shifted to Sangareddy prison.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/k9dicn/article30601189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20PROFKASEEM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kaseems-is-unique-case-explain-why-not-held-for-14-years-hc/article30601190.ece
219,2020/01/19,BJP leaders accused of nominating ‘wrong’ candidates,"As campaigning for the January 22 municipal elections comes to a close on Monday, BJP leaders in Adilabad and Bhainsa municipalities stand accused of selecting ‘wrong’ candidates.

The party leaders have ignored candidates who had clear winning chances thereby losing any advantage they may have had over TRS and Congress in these municipalities, according to party cadre.

In Bhainsa, Nirmal district BJP chief Rama Devi was publicly accused of ‘selling’ tickets to the detriment of committed partymen and those who had winning chances. She was accosted by angry partymen, who openly accused her in the presence of Adilabad MP Soyam Bapu and MLC N. Ramchander Rao on January 13 when they had come visiting to Bhainsa town after the communal violence.

Leaders in Adilabad were even accused of colluding with the TRS in selecting weak candidates from many a ward. “This will ensure that the TRS wins without facing a challenge,” a local partyman said.

“The BJP has some advantage due to polarisation caused by the recent pro and anti CAA-NRC protests.

I will hand over the persons who try to give money to cast vote in the elections to the police”, a poster warning politicians was seen at a small-time laundry shop in Vavilalapalli locality of Karimnagar town on Sunday.

As part of the voters’ awareness programme, the Lok Satta Udyama Samstha district unit started distributing posters educating people to discourage the role of money and gifts in the ensuing municipal elections.

When the Lok Satta voluntary organisations approached the laundry shop, its owner Balaiah readily agreed to display the poster in his shop and support the cause of protection of democracy.

Lok Satta district president N. Srinivas and secretary Prakash Holla were main participants of this campaign. They appealed to voters to not give a chance to politicians to use their money power.

Opposing the freebies being announced by politicians, the Lok Satta demanded that the government should accord priority to education and health. They also called upon voters to exercise their franchise without fail and protect democracy.

222,2020/01/19,A quaint custom comes to an end,"This nondescript village in Yedapally mandal some 25 km from the district headquarters had a strange claim to fame — almost all the 250 families had the grooms leave their homes to stay with his bride and in-laws after marriage called Illarikam Alludu.

This tradition of Illarikam Alludu in this village has almost come to an end with the families discontinuing it and there being only one such Illarikam Alludu of the yesteryears — Chepuri China Laxma Goud — remaining alive.

What made the village with a little over 800 population stand out was that nearly all the 250 families in the village, belonging to BC, SC and ST adopted the sons-in-law. Today all of them have started giving it up slowly. On the other hand, the sons-in-law who had shifted in with their brides through the yesteryears have passed away one after another. The village does not have even a single OC family and all are living depending on agriculture or farm-related activity.

“We don’t know how and when the tradition started but it was alive till recent past. However, the latest generation has not been practising it. We almost said goodbye to it. Only one Illarikam Alludu remains now in the entire village,” said 35-year-old Godugu Hanmanth, husband of the village Sarpanch Rajyalaxmi.

One Maskuri Gangadhar whose father had come for Illarikam to his grandparents’ family, said that in their house alone there used to be four such sons-in-law. As many as 64 family members lived under one roof and after the passing away of grandparents the families divided. Their progeny have been living in the 100-year-old house spread over one acre that has been partitioned by the inheriting families.

An educated young farmer, Srinivas, said that in olden days the village had a higher female population than male population and the parents also wanted to see their daughters live with them. This had laid the foundation for the tradition Another plausible reason was that as cultivation required menfolk the households preferred to bring their sons-in-law home than send their daughters away, he explained.

Though the women population is still a little higher in the village the practice was given up now, said one housewife Swaroopa who did her graduation. Significantly the custom has not been followed by the Muslim families.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wl818y/article30600210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20JAMLAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/a-quaint-custom-comes-to-an-end/article30600212.ece
223,2020/01/19,More women will be seen in the new Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar,"The coming Council of the Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar (MCK) will sport a diffferent look and voice. Women will have a bigger say in the next council as nearly half the number of seats of the total 60 municipal divisions are reserved for women. In another 14 general divisions too they are taking on their male rivals.

Besides, women have outnumbered men in contesting the MCK elections. The figures are revealing. In 30 municipal divisions reserved for women, a total of 369 have remained in fray. While in the remaining 30 divisions reserved for men, only 168 are in the contest. In the 14 general seats, 19 women are contesting the elections, and are giving a tough fight to their male opponents.

Following the active participation of women in the last Municipal Council, the BJP had allocated four seats to women candidates in the general seats, and the TRS had fielded a woman in a general seat. In the remaining nine general divisions too, women are in the fight.

Fighting as independents too

BJP candidates, including former corporator Gugilla Jayashree remained in the fray from the 36th division, former corporator Choppari Jayashree is fighting from the 13th division, former corporator Raparthi Vijaya from the 58th division, and political novice S. Manjulavani was fielded from the 12th division. The TRS had fielded former corporator Katla Vidya from 9th division. Besides, several women candidates are in the fray as independents in the general seats.

In a first in MCK’s history, two women corporators belonging to the TRS were elected unopposed in this election. Challa Swaroopa Rani from the 37th division and Tula Rajeshwari from the 20th division have already tasted victory and gave a boost to other women contestants’ campaigning.. Surprisingly, a total of 12 women candidates are competing from the 32nd division in Karimnagar.

Giving a tough fight

Female contestants in the general seats are giving a tough fight to their male counterparts in the electioneering.

224,2020/01/19,Telangana government is curbing dissent: Haragopal,"Having political ideology and sympathy is not a crime, and by arresting an eminent scholar like Chintakindi Kaseem, the State government wants to create fear in the society to curb dissent, said Prof. Haragopal, convener of Forum Against Repression.

Condemning the arrest of Kaseem, an associate professor in Telugu Department of Osmania University, Prof. Haragopal said “fear and fascism are interrelated, and the government is using it to curb dissent. They would have served notices before arresting him,” he said while addressing a press conference hours after Mulugu police of Siddipet Commissionerate arrested Kaseem in a 2016 case. According to him, the State government is competing with the Centre in fascism with the ‘wicked’ Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, against those who played a key role in the separate Telangana movement, by making ‘arbitrary arrests’ -- and to prevent them from getting bail. “Even when the Maoist party was strong in the State, they (the government) never used the UAP Act. Now, whoever questions the government is being booked under the Act,” he said, while demanding the government to release Kaseem and 16 others, who were arrested for having links with Maoist party, immediately, and scrap the UAP Act.

Prof. Haragopal said that during the agitation for separate State movement, Prof. Kaseem inspired lakhs of people with his speeches.

Earlier, Prof. Gaddam Laxman, State President of Civil Liberties Committee, alleged that Mulugu police have planted incriminating material in Kaseem’s house during the search, and arresting an eminent professor is a humiliation for the family and society, he said.

“How can they barge into a university professor’s house on the campus premises without taking permission from the Vice-Chancellor or registrar. The arrest itself is illegal. It has become a habit to Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao and police,” he said. At least 50 people in 10 vehicles have reached the Professor’s house and broke open the doors, Prof. Laxman added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/jccwmo/article30598870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy19kashim1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-government-is-curbing-dissent-haragopal/article30598871.ece

Given in recognition of its enterprise resource planning (ERP) project, the award was received by Chief General Manager (IS&ERP) A. Ramesh at the 53rd CSI annual convention held in Bhubaneswar on January 17. Director General of Dr. MCRHRD Institute B.P. Acharya, who was the special guest on the occasion, complimented Genco for its splendid work in the field of information technology.

In line with their business strategy and expansion plans, TS-Genco had replaced the existing in-house software application by implementing centralised ERP solutions across all its plants and corporate office. The ERP initiative in TS-Genco was taken up in the name of “TS-SHAKTHI” (TS-Genco System to Harness Ample Knowledge Transformation for Harmony and Integration).

Two projects were taken up as part of the initiative for implementation of e-office (SAP-FLM) to leverage the business and to use state-of-the-art executive dashboard for effective decision making using SAP analytics. The e-office solution was inaugurated with the pilot go-live from February 22, 2018 at the corporate office and its roll-out for generating stations was completed in September 2018 -- in three phases, according to Mr. Ramesh.

Mr. Ramesh explained that the state-of-the-art executive dashboard for effective decision-making was launched to make use of huge transactional data being generated in ERP system. The dashboard has enabled TS-Genco to take quick and informed decisions at senior level management with the help of a mobile application to bring important key performance indicators (KPIs) such as online generation, state demand and reservoir levels on one unified platform.

A jury of experts and the award secretariat from CSI-SIG visited the TS-Genco ERP project office as part of a field visit on November 18 last year and selected the project for the final round of selection. Final presentation of the shortlisted projects to the jury was made on December at the University of Hyderabad, where the project was declared winner of “Award of Excellence” from a large number of nominations and presentations, comprehensive questioning and cross examination.

226,2020/01/19,Present ‘arrested professor’: HC,"The Telangana High Court on Saturday directed the Gajwel police of Siddipet commissionerate to produce associate professor Chintakindi Kaseem, whom they arrested, before it on Sunday morning.

The order was passed by a bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, after hearing a habeas corpus petition.

The plea was filed by Civil Liberties Committee Telangana State president Gaddam Laxman by moving a House Motion.

Saturday being a holiday for the HC, the bench heard the contentions of the petitioner’s lawyer V. Raghunath and government counsel at the residence of the Chief Justice here. The bench directed the police to present the associate professor before it at the CJ’s residence at 10.30 a.m. on Sunday.

“It is surprising that in a First Information Report registered four years ago, the police have not been able to arrest the professor,” the bench observed in its order. The bench also noted that a professor engaged in conducting classes in the university was claimed to be absconding from the university.

“Therefore, the stand being taken by the State is rather unbelievable,” the bench said in its order. The House Motion was moved by Mr. Laxman around 10 a.m. even as police were searching the professor’s house.

The bookshelves in the quarters of professor Kaseem

The HC Registry informed the petitioner to appear at the CJ’s residence where the bench headed by him would hear the matter at 5 p.m.

While presenting his arguments, lawyer Raghunath said detention and house arrest of the professor in the name of searches was illegal. They broke open the rear doors of his house and terrorised his family members, he charged.

The lawyer told media persons that the CJ had sought to know from the police if they had taken permission of Osmania University Vice-Chancellor before conducting searches in the professor’s house.

According to the lawyer, the CJ had told Special Government Pleader Harinder Prasad, who appeared on behalf of the government, that he had noticed during a visit to Warangal that none of the nearly 3,000 non-bailable warrants had been executed by the police. The SGP said the police were about to present the arrested professor before a magistrate in Gajwel.

227,2020/01/19,Meerut violence: victims’ kin seek judicial intervention,"It has been a month since Mohd Salahuddin is seeking justice for his deceased brother. He claims he has video evidence of December 20, 2019, which suggests that his brother Aleem was possibly killed in police firing on Hapur Road during the Anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest.

“When the magisterial inquiry began, the additional district magistrate told local newspapers that the Senior Superintendent of Police has told him through a letter that somebody had dropped Aleem’s body at the district hospital. I think I not only lost my brother, but we also lost faith in humanity on December 20. No representative of the district administration or the ruling political party has visited us in the last one month,” he told The Hindu.

The police, he said, claim 36 unarmed policemen were cornered by the agitators in Bhawani Market. They don’t say that it was the Muslim shopkeepers who protected them from the protesters till the reinforcement arrived. “How can I approach an inquiry committee with evidence in such an atmosphere,” he asked, adding that he would approach the court for justice. “Even the local Muslim leaders failed us. They could not get the post-mortem report released on time.”

Forensic reports

Meanwhile, both the police as well as lawyers of the deceased are waiting for the forensic reports to prove their version of what transpired on December 20.

The distance from which the bullets were fired is crucial. Interestingly, in most cases, the bullets have left the body.

Ali Zaidi, a Delhi-based Supreme Court lawyer, who is handling the case of Aleem and four others who died of gunshot injuries on December 20, said they would lodge an FIR against the police and are contemplating approaching the Supreme Court to shift the investigation out of Uttar Pradesh.

“We don’t trust the local police to conduct a fair investigation against themselves. They have not been able to tell whose bullets killed these five men. The post-mortem report of two of them has not been released. The father and uncle of a witness were detained and were threatened that their names would be included in the list of protesters,” he alleged.

Meanwhile, the police are building a narrative around the role of the Popular Front of India, whose 10 alleged members have been arrested, behind the protest and ensuing violence in Meerut.

Ram Arj, SP (Crime), who is heading the SIT, said there was a difference between allegation and scientific evidence. “The fact that we have arrested only 54 out of hundreds named in the FIR shows that we don’t want any innocent to suffer. We are not holding back anybody's post -mortem report. There is nothing to fear, those who have evidence should come forward,” he said.

Refusing to divulge who killed the five men, Mr. Arj said: “The investigation is still on. We are still waiting for results from the forensic lab. What I can say is that we have recovered one 9 mm pistol, 32 bore pistol, 315 bore country-made pistols and live cartridges from the arrested persons.”

In Bijnor, Afzal Ahmad Ansari advocate and uncle of Suleman, who was allegedly killed by police in self-defence, rejected the idea of a magisterial inquiry.

“Though we have been approached by the police, we don’t want to record testimonies in front of an officer who ordered firing on December 20. Our demand for a separate FIR against the police has not been met. We have approached the Allahabad High Court and will plead the case to be shifted to some other district,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8dnt09/article30602046.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19-MEERUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/meerut-violence-victims-kin-seek-judicial-intervention/article30602047.ece

Sulav Karmakar, a student of the History Department, is the third person to be arrested in connection with the incident that left several men injured on January 15. Karmakar was picked up from Godda in Jharkhand, police said.

Two TMCP leaders — Achintya Bagdi and Saber Ali — were arrested earlier for their alleged involvement in the assault on Left-leaning students. The attack took place a week after the BJP Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta was heckled by Left-leaning students after he came to deliver a lecture on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on January 8. An SFI leader of the university alleged that the attackers said the assault was a fallout of the demonstration the Left students held during Mr. Dasgupta’s visit to the campus.

Mr. Dasgupta, Visva-Bharati Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakraborty and others had to remain confined for around eight hours in a building of the university outside which hundreds of Left-leaning students staged a sit-in, accusing the politician of promoting hatred among communities.

229,2020/01/19,Mark pre-British rule inhabitants as indigenous: Assamese Muslims,"An organisation representing Assamese Muslims has said only the communities that inhabited Assam before the advent of the British deserve Constitutional safeguards as indigenous people.

This has attained significance in the wake of suggestions by the Bharatiya Janata Party, ruling Assam in alliance with two regional parties, that 1951 be the cut-off year for determining citizens with special concessions for non-Muslim settlers.

Assam, then comprising much of present-day northeast, came under British rule after the Treaty of Yandaboo in February 1826 that ended a prolonged war with the Burmese who had invaded and taken control of the region.

Constitutional safeguards

“If 1951 is regarded as the cut-off year to provide Constitutional safeguards, will those who had migrated to Assam and got their names included in the 1951 National Register of Citizens be protected?” asked Hafijul Ahmed, president of the All Assam Goria Moria Deshi Jatiya Parishad.

Goria, Moria and Deshi are some of the categories of Assamese Muslims who distinguish themselves from the Bengali-speaking migrants and resent being equated with them.

“Indigenous people had converted to Islam to form these communities. But we are often regarded as Bangladeshi migrants because of our religion. By setting 1951 as the cut-off date, the identity of these communities, relevant since the Ahom era [13th century], will be under threat,” Mr. Ahmed told newspersons on Sunday.

Insisting that Constitutional safeguards should not be based on some year or date, leaders of the Parishad said selecting 1951 as the cut-off date would enable the Bhatiali, Mymensinga, Dhakai, Sylheti, Pabnaya and Boguraya (Muslims from areas now in Bangladesh) to get the indigenous tag.

Assam Agitation

“This will go against the spirit of the Assam Agitation, which was against illegal immigration from Bangladesh and prescribed March 25, 1971, as the cut-off date for detecting and deporting foreigners,” Mr. Ahmed said.

The NRC in Assam was updated on the basis of the Assam Accord date.

Citizens under the banner of ‘Goa Unity Forum’ gathered in Ponda town of South Goa district on Saturday and held a protest rally. Addressing the rally, retired IAS officer Arvind Bhatikar, who has been spearheading anti-CAA protests in Goa, claimed the new citizenship law will “destroy India” and said, “There is need that we must uphold the Constitution of India. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act is discriminatory and against the Constitution.”

Speaking at the protest, Sahitya Akademi Award winning Konkani writer N. Shivdas said the Constitution is like a “holy book” that unites people of all religions. “We all must uphold and protect this holy book,” he said. Congress MLA Ravi Naik said that CAA was “not only against the Muslim community but also against Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.”

However, BJP leaders in Goa took to social media to condemn the protest. “Why Azadi slogans at Ponda rally? #CAA is a law. Not a word about it. Only emotive, misguiding speeches. Palpable desperation of Congress and like minded!” BJP’s Goa general secretary and former MP Narendra Sawaikar tweeted. In another tweet, he uploaded a picture of a protester holding a placard with the message: “We Stand with JNU” and added, “Authorities need to find the source of such posters at Ponda rally.”

BJP’s South Goa district general secretary Navin Pai Raikar also hit out at the protesters. “These are migrants who live in #Goa on government doles.

“Instead of Hindi, English and Urdu, the names of railway stations on platform signboards across Uttarakhand will now be written in Hindi, English and Sanskrit,” he said.

“Since Sanskrit is the second official language of Uttarakhand, the names of railway stations written in Urdu on platform signboards in the state will be replaced with those in Sanskrit,” the official said.

The names of railway stations in Uttarakhand on platform signboards still appear in Urdu as most of them belong to the period when the state was part of Uttar Pradesh where Urdu is the second official language.

However, as per rules of the Railway Manual appropriate change should have been made on these signboards in 2010 after Sanskrit was made the second official language of the state, he said.

Sanskrit was made the second official language of Uttarakhand in 2010 during the chief ministership of Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who is now Union HRD Minister. However, not much will change in the spelling of the names of railway stations in Uttarakhand when they are written in Sanskrit as both Hindi and Sanskrit use the same Devnagri script.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sanskrit-to-replace-urdu-on-railway-signboards-in-uttarakhand/article30599212.ece
232,2020/01/19,"CAA protest: Emergency days were better, says septuagenarian lawyer out of Lucknow jail after a month","The situation during the Emergency in 1975 was “better” than it is today, claimed septuagenarian advocate and activist Mohammad Shoaib on Sunday after spending almost a month in jail in connection with the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

After stepping out of the Lucknow district jail, on bail, Mr. Shoaib, who also spent time in jail during the Emergency imposed by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and was part of the Socialist Party, said the situation today seemed worse for dissenters.

“The situation during the Emergency was better than this. That Emergency was declared but the situation was not as bad. Back then, when we were taken to jail, we were all kept together and provided B-class facilities,” Mr. Shoaib said. “But here we were locked up with criminals and they tried to harass us in as many ways as they could.”

He alleged that during interrogation, a police officer abused him and when he asked him to stop, threatened him that his family “would rot in jail for life.” “Dozagh bana dunga (will make it hell for your family), [he said],” Mr. Shoaib said.

‘Anti-people policies’

While accusing the U.P. police of oppressing the Rihai Manch, an outfit headed by him that provides legal help to victims of hate crimes and those implicated in “false” terror cases, the lawyer said, “We will continue to speak against the oppressive and anti-people policies of the government.”

Mr. Shoaib was granted bail by a Lucknow court last week in connection with the violence in the State capital during the anti-CAA protests on December 19. He was among the more than 1,240 persons arrested by police over the violent protests in Uttar Pradesh.

On police radar many times in the past for his activism, in 2008, he was also brutally assaulted by fellow lawyers in Lucknow and Faizabad, in the court compound as they did not want him appearing for terror accused persons. Over the years, Mr. Shoaib is credited with getting around a dozen persons acquitted of terror cases.

Soon after his release, Mr. Shoaib said his priority would be the release of other protesters still in jail. “We will get them out and then carry forward this movement. This movement won’t stop,” he said.

He urged the Opposition parties to “break their silence” on the issue and stand with the people.

According to the FIR lodged at Hazratganj police station on December 19, Mr. Shoaib faces several serious charges such as rioting, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy, even though his name does not feature in it.

The police, however, had alleged that Rihai Manch instigated the violence and named it in the FIR along with the Popular Front of India, the AISA and the BAMCEF, among others, as conspirators.

In its submission before the Allahabad High Court, which was hearing a habeas corpus writ filed on behalf of Mr. Shoaib, the additional government advocate recently quoted police records to say that he was arrested at 8.45 a.m. on December 20 from the Hotel Clarks Avadh intersection, a couple of km away from the advocate’s residence.

The contention was rubbished by the lawyer’s family. His wife Malka Bi alleged foul play in the police version as her husband did not even attend the protest and was under house arrest.

“When a person was at home, how can he be part of a riot? Police said they found him near Clarks Avadh. If he is in police custody how can he reach Clarks Avadh,” she asked recently while talking to The Hindu.

233,2020/01/19,Shutdown in Shirdi over birthplace row,"The temple town of Shirdi in Ahmednagar district observed a total shutdown on Sunday in protest against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s reported statement that Pathri in Parbhani district was Sai Baba’s birthplace.

While the Sai Baba temple remained open for devotees and tourists, Shirdi’s marketplace and establishments downed shutters in an unprecedented shutdown in the history of the town.

The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust and other social outfits made provisions for tea, breakfast and meals in front of the temple to mitigate the inconvenience to visitors.

Also Read Row breaks out over Sai Baba’s birthplace

Residents of around 25 villages near Shirdi, too, joined ranks to support the bandh.

The Shirdi shutdown was countered by events and demonstrations by residents of Pathri to convince the locals of Shirdi that the Parbhani village was indeed Sai Baba’s birthplace.

Sena MPs split

The controversy created a split in the ranks of the Shiv Sena, with the party’s MPs from Shirdi and Parbhani batting for their regional claims.

While Shirdi MP Sadashiv Lokhande participated in a protest march in the town, Parbhani MP Sanjay Jadhav countered the claims of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust, saying that the Sri Sai Janmasthan Temple Trust in Parbhani had 29 pieces of proof that Pathri was indeed the saint’s birthplace.

Mr. Lokhande said, “I am a Sai bhakt [devotee] first and then an MP… Sai Baba came to Shirdi when he was 16 years of age. The great man always transcended caste and religion and never revealed his birthplace or caste. I will be talking to the Chief Minister tonight and will be leading a delegation from Shirdi to meet him tomorrow.”

At the same time, he stressed that neither he nor anybody else in Shirdi was opposed to Pathri’s development.

“The Chief Minister has announced a grant of ₹100 crore for Pathri’s development … While I am all for that, the government ought not to say that the Parbhani village was Sai Baba’s birthplace,” the MP said, while promising that devotees would not be inconvenienced during the indefinite shutdown.

Fear of competition

In response to the locals and temple trust authorities of Shirdi, their counterparts in Parbhani have claimed that the former were afraid that the development of Pathri would have a detrimental effect on Shirdi’s economy.

“This is a silly controversy … Every time, we see leaders from western Maharashtra play politics over every issue the moment they sense a threat to the status quo. But this time, we have solid proof in the form of municipal records and other sources that Pathri is indeed Sai Baba’s birthplace. The folks at Shirdi are going to have to accept the truth …Why are they getting worried about their existence if their consciences are clear?” asked Mr. Jadhav.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and MLC Babajani Durrani, a trustee of the Sri Sai Janmasthan Temple in Parbhani, accused the Shirdi Trust of deliberately doing away with proof that showed Pathri to be the saint’s place of birth.

“Marathwada is the birthplace of a number of saints, including Dnyaneshwar. There should be no question of controversy on this issue of Sai Baba’s birth ... In fact, a 1972 biography of Sai Baba published by the Shirdi Sansthan mentions Pathri to be his place of birth. It seems they are worried that if Pathri is developed, Shirdi will not attract the same footfall,” he said.

In Parbhani, a bhajan demonstration was observed in front of the district Collectorate, with locals conducting a ‘Sai Jaagar’ programmes to “awaken” their counterparts in Shirdi to the truth about the saint’s real birthplace.

Ironically, even as 30-odd villages observed a total shutdown, it was business as usual in Loni village, the hometown of Congress-turned-Bharatiya Janata Party leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, one of the most vociferous proponents of the bandh.

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar urged opposing parties to take a conciliatory approach to resolve the impasse, saying that the State government was taking necessary steps so that the shutdown would be called off soon. “The Chief Minister has called for a meeting tomorrow, in which both contending parties will present their case. Till that time, it is pointless to hurt anyone’s sentiments without reason,” said Mr. Pawar.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cszvhg/article30572343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/shirdi-bandh-shops-eateries-local-transport-shut/article30599017.ece
234,2020/01/19,Watch | U.P. Police accused of ‘stealing’ blankets of women CAA protesters,"“Kambal Chor U.P. Police (Blanket thief, U.P. police)” was trending on Twitter on Sunday after women protesters holding a sit-in against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at Lucknow’s iconic Clocktower accused the police of snatching away their supplies, food items and blankets in the night.

Protesters posted videos showing policemen carrying away the supplies with them late on Saturday even as those demonstrating at the site raised an objection.

“Yogi’s police looting things from mothers and sisters. Look how they are looting things from the Clocktower,” Congress worker Sadaf Jafar posted on social media along with a video of the police carrying away the items.

Another protester said on Sunday morning, the third day of the protest: “There is no cooperation from the police. They snatched our blankets in the night. They didn’t give us the permission to put up a shelter. They took away all the eatables and blankets arranged by us from home.”

Braving the cold and foggy conditions, at least 500 women and children have been holding a sit-in under the Ghantaghar or Clocktower in old Lucknow since Friday. A heavy police force has been deployed at the site. On Saturday evening, the Rapid Action Force too staged a march around the Clocktower.

Since Saturday evening, police restricted entry of men into the protest zone, which was dominated by the presence of women raising slogans and holding up banners and placards against the CAA and the proposed nationwide National Register Citizens. Police said this was done on the request of the women protesters to prevent anti-social elements from sabotaging the demonstration.

Additional DCP Vikas Chandra Tripathi on Saturday evening said “legal action” would be taken against the protesters for violation of Section 144, which restricts assembly of more than four people. The protest is “illegal,” he told The Hindu, adding there was no question of providing permission to the protesters to hold their sit-in.

U.P. police issue clarification

Mr. Tripathi said some outfits were distributing blankets during the “illegal” dharna, following which a large number of people nearby, who were not a part of the demonstration, were also coming to collect the blankets.

“Police removed the blankets and the people of the organisation as per law,” he said, urging people not to spread rumours.

In another tweet, the U.P. police said they prevented some people from putting up a shelter with ropes and bamboo sticks. “Kambalo ko vidhik tarike se kabze mein liya gaya (The blankets were seized as per the legal process),” police said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ku8f7e/article30599070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/clocktowerjfif,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/up-police-accused-of-stealing-blankets-of-women-caa-protesters/article30598986.ece

237,2020/01/19,"Odisha to spend nearly ₹3,500 cr. on temples","At a time when temple politics dominates the political narrative in the country with the BJP remaining ahead of others, the ruling Biju Janata Dal does not seem to be lagging behind in Odisha.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, in his fifth term, has decided to spend nearly ₹3,500 crore on development of temples and their surroundings, much to the delight of the people in the State.

Mr. Patnaik has chalked out grandiose plans to transform Puri into a world heritage city, akin to Kashi Vishwanath corridor project. He has embarked upon redeveloping the surroundings of Lord Jagannath temple, the cultural nerve centre of the State, and development of infrastructure in the pilgrim town.

Initially, convincing people to hand over their ancestral land and homes for the project had appeared to be difficult. But Mr. Patnaik pursued with his mission and obstructions have started disappearing fast.

For the development of Puri, the State government has announced an expenditure of ₹3,208 crore under the Augmentation Basic Amenities and Development of Heritage and Architecture (ABADHA) scheme over three years. While ₹719 crore has been earmarked for 2019-20, the cost of the projects would be around ₹1,402 crore and ₹1,087 crore in 2020-21 and 2021-22, respectively.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1al2lj/article30597366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19PATNAIK2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-to-spend-nearly-3500-cr-on-temples/article30597367.ece

239,2020/01/19,M.P. focuses on reviving threatened tree species,"In a marked shift from the British-era focus on high-value timber to indigenous species having traditional value, the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department in 2019 planted 70 lakh saplings of such threatened tree species in a bid to revive biodiversity, support livelihoods and combat climate change.

Largest forest cover

With around a quarter of its area under forests, Madhya Pradesh, according to the India State of Forest Report, 2019, has the largest forest cover of 77,482.49 sq. km in the country. And of the 216 naturally occurring tree species in the State, 32 face the threat of extinction, said P.C. Dubey, Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Research and Extension Wing.

Under working plans prepared by 11 locals units across the State, the threatened species were identified as having less than 1% of cover in forests, based on surveys in 300-400 plots of 0.1 hectare each selected randomly in each district. Moreover, the wing collated data based on field studies and reviewed third-party studies by research institutes.

A species was deemed threatened also due to the present threat and future threat perception to it, explained Mr. Dubey, adding that saplings were nurtured in government-run nurseries in their local conditions.

‘Local situations’

When reasons for the scant availability of a species, and its low density and germination rate are local, reads the plan document, there is a need to find solutions in local situations too.

The threatened species include bija, having high timber and fodder value, used to cure diabetes and make concussion equipment; tinsa, used to improve fertility in women; salai, producing resin and gum; and dahiman, used to cure high blood pressure.

“We plan to revive the traditional wisdom as well as boost livelihoods with the involvement of locals, in line with the State Forest Policy, 2005 and State vision document,” said Mr. Dubey.

The species, being revived in compliance with International Union for Conservation of Nature guidelines, could also withstand harsh climatic conditions, and vagaries of nature, thereby proving useful to combat climate change and mitigate its effects, added Mr. Dubey.

Lack of awareness

Lack of awareness on the traditional importance of the species was a major reason for their endangerment, he claimed. “Besides, the British and the department for too long focused on timber of greater economic value like sal. For the first time in the country, we have taken initiative in identifying species under threat and taking steps to protect them. Now, at least 10% of all plantations in the State will have the species under threat.”

Mr. Singh was inducted into the SP in the presence of party chief Akhilesh Yadav and SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav. Some Bahujan Samaj Party leaders also joined the SP at the party headquarters here.

Mr. Singh and some others were expelled from HYV, formed by Adityanath in 2002, on charges of indiscipline in 2017. He had then created a splinter outfit and declared himself its national president.

Welcoming Mr. Singh and others to the SP fold, Mr. Akhilesh said, “The days of the Adityanath government are numbered and the countdown has already begun.”

He said the BJP government has slapped cases against the Opposition leaders for protesting against its policies. “The government is doing injustice from day one and false cases are being lodged for protesting,” said Mr. Akhilesh. He added that the BJP is only promoting communalism and creating a Hindu-Muslim divide.

On the occasion, Mr. Mulayam Singh termed the youth as the future of the SP and said that farmers, youth and traders have to be strengthened to make India a developed country.

Mr. Singh’s shift of loyalty assumes significance as the HYV was founded to promote “Hindutva and nationalism” and went on to play a significant role in shaping Adityanath’s political rise in the State.

Special judge (U.P. dacoity-affected area) Sudhir Kumar pulled up the court official for inability to produce the case diary at the time of delivering the verdict and asked him to place it before the court on January 24.

The court is likely to give its verdict on the role of the four surviving accused — Posha, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Shyambabu. While Posha is still in jail, the rest are out on bail. Three other dacoits, including Phoolan Devi’s close friend Man Singh, are absconding.

State party chief Sunil Jakhar, in a recently held meeting with the new leadership of the Youth Congress and the party’s women wing, had conveyed to leaders and workers the need to ensure that people across Punjab are made aware of the work done by the Amarinder government.

“All wings of the party, including the youth and women wings, would make people aware, be it in cities, towns or villages, about the development work done by the Congress government in Punjab. They would also expose the anti-people policies of the BJP-led government at the Centre. It would be a continuous process,” he told The Hindu on Saturday.

Similarly, 44 lakh families have been covered by the health insurance scheme and the beneficiaries were provided cash-free treatment worth ₹5 lakh... these are a few accomplishments among others,” said Mr. Jakhar.

He alleged that the BJP was indulging in politics of hate for petty gains. “The BJP government, which has failed on all issues of development, employment for youth, education, controlling inflation etc., was now cultivating hate,” he said, adding that the party cadre would expose the wrong-doings of the Narendra Modi government and motivate people to rise to the occasion to protect the basic structure of the Indian Constitution.

244,2020/01/19,Maharashtra will oppose any attempt to forcefully control population,"Maharashtra government has warned that it would strongly oppose any attempts by the Centre to impose a two-child norm in the State.

Maharashtra’s Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik launched a scathing attack on Saturday against Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat on his statement favouring a ‘two-child policy’ for the country. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader said Maharashtra government will also legally fight a two-child norm.

Maharashtra already has several population control regulations in place and does not need a ‘forceful vasectomy’ policy for controlling population, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leader said.

“Mohan Bhagwatji wants a two-child law and can have his view. He may not be aware that Maharashtra already has several laws on this (population control), as do many other States. Still, if Bhagwatji wants to forcefully do vasectomies then let Modiji make such a law and we will see,” Mr. Malik said

The Minister also raked up, for context, the ‘Emergency era’ of 1976 when Congress leader Sanjay Gandhi had launched a compulsory sterilisation programme to check population growth. The NCP leader said the RSS must not forget those days and how the previous attempt to forcefully implement the policy ended up in the dumps. “We saw in past what happened with this policy when implemented during the Emergency. Let the RSS or the government take the step and see its repercussions once again,” he cautioned.

Earlier, there were reports highlighting the Sangh’s attempts at pushing the Narendra Modi government to introduce a population control policy. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat brought up the issue during a speech at the Moradabad Institute of Technology (MIT) earlier this week, clarifying the policy was not specific to any particular region.

The RSS chief said the policy was the need of the hour but it was up to the Central government to take a final call on it.

245,2020/01/19,Congress targets Haryana government over infighting,"The Congress hit out at the BJP-led Haryana government on Saturday, accusing it of paying no heed to people’s issues due to their internal conflicts.

Control over CID

The charge comes amid an ongoing tussle between Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar and Home Minister Anil Vij over control of the Criminal Investigation Department.

State Congress unit chief and Rajya Sabha MP Kumari Selja said on Saturday that the tussle between the Chief Minister and Home Minister clearly shows that for BJP leaders, clinging on to the CID was more important than people’s welfare.

Ms. Selja, addressing party workers in Sirsa, said that cases of crime and atrocities against women are increasing rapidly in Haryana, which is at third position in the country on such crimes.

Initial inquiry had revealed that Mr. Mishra’s actual income between May 13, 2007, and October 5, 2011, was about ₹1.57 crore, but he had allegedly spent more than ₹7.61 crore. Further investigation into the sources of assets purchased by the former Minister and his family members in the name of a trust named “Samiti” and institutes is under way, said the agency.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ed-attaches-assets-of-former-up-minister/article30597113.ece
247,2020/01/19,Derara Hurisa beats the Tata Mumbai Marathon record in borrowed shoes,"Ethiopians Brihanu Testome, Ayele Abshero and Derara Hurisa chatted among themselves as they strode along the Tata Mumbai Marathon route, before Hurisa took charge to finish in two hours, eight minutes, nine seconds — under the course record 2:08:35 (Gideon Kipketer, 2016).

Hurisa earned $45,000 first prize, plus a $15,000 bonus for the record. He also dragged Ayele (2:08:20) and Testome (2:08:26) under the course mark. The first seven runners in men’s elite category finished under 2:10min in this IAAF Gold Label event, run along a slightly revised course, in cooler January weather and pushed by pacemakers for a major part of the race.

The women’s winner, Ethiopian Amane Beriso (2:24:51s) did not get on top of the conditions and struggled in the last phase. But, with the nearest challenger far behind, she held on to breast the tape first, but missed the course record of 2:24:33s (Valentine Kipkieter, 2014). She will also be richer by $45,000.

Long-limbed pace-setter Sylvester Kipketer loped ahead of Amane from start to finish, even alerted the Ethiopian to forget fatigue and put in a burst to the tape as the course record was within grasp till the end. Rodah Jepkorir finished in 2:27:14 for the silver while Haven Hailu bagged the bronze in 2:28:56.

The men’s race turned into an engrossing tussle, seven remaining in the lead pack after the pace-setters had exited. Defending champion Cosmas Lagat from Kenya also faded away, supposedly due to injury. Ayele remained the name to watch (personal best 2:04:23). “My body felt good at the 30km mark and thoughts in my mind changed from finishing to running in record-breaking time.”

However, running in borrowed shoes, Hurisa stole the show with a stunning burst to leave his fellow countrymen behind. The champion is a cross-country runner with no marathon experience. “I knew Ayele is experienced over this distance and looked to him to show the way. I kept telling him to take charge of the race. Sensing that he was holding back, I decided to finish,” said Hurisa, a World junior athletics participant for Ethiopia in cross country.

His shoes were borrowed from Abraham Girma, a fellow elite runner. “I lost my regular shoes in flight,” said the champion. The TMM is organised by Procam International.

The results: Marathon: Elite men: 1. Derara Hurisa (Eth) 2:08:09; 2. Ayele Abshero (Eth) 2:08:20; 3. Bhiranu Tsehome (Eth) 2:08:26. Indians: 1. Srinu Bugatha 2:18:44; 2. Sher Singh 2:24:00; 3. Durga Bahadur B 2:24:03.

248,2020/01/19,Maharashtra stars excel at the Khelo India Youth Games,"Pune swimmer Mihir Ambre secured two more gold medals by winning the under-21 boys’ 100m butterfly crown and contributing in 4x100m medley relay victory as Maharashtra collected four titles on the third day of swimming at the Khelo India Youth Games here on Sunday.

Ambre’s time of 54.91, below his personal best of 54.1, was good enough to earn him a convincing victory ahead of Delhi’s Sameer Sejwal (57.43) and Karnataka’s Sanjay C.J. (57.52).

The 19-year-old, who had also won the 50m butterfly, repeated his Khelo India performance in Pune where he had claimed both titles in under-17 age group.

Apeksha Fernandes (girls’ under-17, 400m individual medley, 5:12.19), Kenisha Gupta (girls’ under-17, 100m freestyle, 59.14) lifted Maharashtra’s showing.

Mihir Ambre, Rudranish Mishra and Aaron Fernandes helped Maharashtra make light of the five-second lead that India’s best backstroke swimmer Srihari Nataraj of Karnataka had opened up over Suchit Patil. Maharashtra timed 3:56.83 to win the 4x100m medley relay by 0.24 seconds.

Anurag Singh (boys’ under-21, 400m freestyle, 4:08.09), Bikram Changmai (boys’ under-17, 100m butterfly, 56.64) and boys’ under-17 team (4x100 medley, 4:00.63) earned three crowns for Delhi.

Shivangi Sarma of Assam claimed her fourth gold medal (girls’ under-21, 100m freestyle, 59.26) in a lop-sided contest, featuring only four swimmers.

WEIGHTLIFTING: Maharashtra lifters claimed three gold medals in the weightlifting arena.

Prajakta Khalkar (snatch 81kg, clean and jerk 100kg, total 181kg) took the girls’ under-21 64kg title, while Abhishek Nipane (114, 154, 268) and Kiran Marathe (111, 140, 251) won the 73kg boys’ under-21 and under-17 crowns respectively.

Tamil Nadu had a fruitful day as Y. Poorna Sri (75, 90, 165) picked up the 64kg title and M. Lekhamaalya (75, 95, 170) secured the 71kg top honour in girls’ under-17 events.

WRESTLING: Haryana wrestlers rose to the expectation to secure five titles, while Maharashtra and Punjab athletes took two apiece in under-21 events.

Rohit Dahiya (61kg), Akash Dahiya (65kg), Sanjeev Kumar (70kg) among boys, Tamanna (68kg) and Karuna (76kg) among girls boosted Haryana.

Vijay Patil (57kg) and Pruthviraj Patil (97kg) were the gold medallists from Maharashtra, while Prateek Singh (74kg) and Loveleen Kaur (62kg) won top honours for Punjab.

Bharti Baghal (57kg) was the lone winner from Uttar Pradesh.

KHO KHO: Maharashtra made a clean sweep, winning all four titles in under-21 and under-17 boys and girls.

249,2020/01/19,Kasuza and Masvaure score fifties in Zimbabwe’s first test against Sri Lanka,"Kevin Kasuza struck a half-century on debut while opening partner Prince Masvaure recorded his maiden 50 as Zimbabwe finished the first day of the first cricket Test against Sri Lanka on 189/2 here.

Masvaure, playing in his third Test, made 55 before he was caught by Dimuth Karunaratne off slow left-arm bowler Lasith Embuldeniya.

Kasuza, one of three Zimbabwe players handed their Test debut, survived a dropped chance off a miscued hook shot before bringing up his own half-century. He eventually fell leg before to Lasith Kumara for 63 after facing 214 balls and spending more than five hours at the crease.

250,2020/01/19,‘Dhoni will be retained by CSK in 2021’,"M.S. Dhoni “will be retained” by Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the 2021 IPL auction irrespective of whether he plays for India again or not, asserted former BCCI president N. Srinivasan.

The lack of a BCCI central contract for the World Cup-winning captain has sparked fresh rumours of his retirement but Srinivasan, who is the vice-president and managing director of Indian Cements which own CSK, made it clear that Dhoni will continue to play for his franchise.

“People keep saying when will he... how long will he play, etc. He will play. I can assure you. He will play this year. Next year he will go (to) the auction; he will be retained. So there is no doubt in anybody’s mind,” Srinivasan said at an India Cements event.

251,2020/01/19,South Africa on the brink of innings defeat against England,"England captain Joe Root produced a Test-best bowling performance to push South Africa to the brink on the fourth day of the third Test here on Sunday.

Root took four for 31 as South Africa slumped to 102 for six after being forced to follow-on. The hosts were still 188 runs short of avoiding an innings defeat, with England seemingly assured of taking an unbeatable 2-1 series lead into the final Test in Johannesburg from Friday.

England dominated the day despite a second lengthy rain break in two days.

It needed only 28 balls to dismiss South Africa’s last four batsmen for the addition of a single run at the start of play, with Stuart Broad picking up three of the wickets without conceding a run.

South Africa were all out for 209 and Root immediately enforced the follow-on.

Rain early in South Africa’s second innings threatened to thwart England’s push for victory but fast bowler Mark Wood struck twice when play resumed more than three hours later.

Wood used his extreme pace to send Dean Elgar’s off stump flying out of the ground before he had Zubayr Hamza feeling for a ball outside his leg stump to present a catch to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.

Then it was over to Root, who in 90 previous Tests had never taken more than two wickets in an innings.

Bowling from the end where fellow off-spinner Dom Bess took five wickets in the first innings, he trapped Pieter Malan leg before wicket in the last over before tea.

Root took three more wickets after the interval.

Rassie van der Dussen was superbly caught at short leg by Ollie Pope and first innings top-scorer Quinton de Kock fell to a leaping catch at backward point by a leaping Wood.

South Africa captain Faf du Plessis was sixth out after making 36, his highest score of what has been a poor series for him. He was another bat-pad victim, giving Pope his fifth catch of the match.

In overcast conditions at the start of play, Broad and Sam Curran achieved some swing with a ball which was almost new, but they were aided by some poor shots by the South African batsmen.

Broad struck with the fourth delivery of the morning when Vernon Philander missed a drive against a full delivery which swung in between bat and pad. He was out for 27.

Curran uprooted De Kock’s middle stump with the fifth ball of the next over with the left-hander missing an extravagant drive against a ball angled in from the left-armed bowler.

De Kock had not added to his overnight score of 63.

Keshav Maharaj was bowled off a bottom edge when he tried to pull a ball from Broad before Kagiso Rabada, who scored the only run in the collapse, hit a simple catch to mid-off to give Broad his third wicket.

Broad finished with three for 30.

252,2020/01/19,Prithvi Shaw slams 150 in India-A’s 12-run win,"Prithvi Shaw slammed a 100-ball 150 in India-A’s 12-run victory over New Zealand XI in the second practice game on Sunday. The 20-year-old Shaw struck 22 fours and two sixes.

The first Test starts on Feb. 21 at Hamilton and the second match is scheduled in Christchurch, starting Feb. 29.

India-A was all out for 372 in 49.2 overs and restricted the host to 360 for six to register its second win of the tour.

Mayank Agarwal (32) and Shaw stitched an 89-run opening stand but the former was dismissed by pacer Andrew Hazeldine. Skipper Shubman Gill (24), Suryakumar Yadav (26) and Ishan Kishan (14), alongside Shaw, kept the scoreboard ticking, helping India reach 241 in 31 overs.

After Shaw’s dismissal in the beginning of the 35th over, all-rounder Vijay Shankar stamped his authority with a 41-ball 58.

Needing 373, New Zealand suffered an early blow with opener Katene Clarke (1) departing in the second over. Josh Clarkson (14) soon followed, leaving the home team struggling at 27 for two. Opener Jack Boyle (130) and Finn Allen (87) kept New Zealand in the fight before the hosts ran out of overs.

For India, right-arm medium-pacer Ishan Porel (2/39) and spinner Krunal Pandya (2/50) grabbed two wickets each.

Batting first, India scored 297 for four and then bowled out Sri Lanka for 207 with spinners Siddhesh Veer and Ravi Bishnoi getting two wickets apiece.

Asked to bat, the Indians produced a team effort with all the top and middle-order batsmen making useful contributions to post a big score.

Garg’s 56 came off 72 balls with two boundaries while Jaiswal needed 74 deliveries for his 59 (8x4). Jurel hit three fours and one six in his 48-ball unbeaten knock.

254,2020/01/19,Former cricketer Man Mohan Sood passes away,"Former Test batsman and National selector Man Mohan Sood passed away here on Sunday morning. He was 80.

A batsman with flair to play strokes, Sood made his First Class debut against Services at Ferozeshah Kotla in 1957 and played his final Ranji Trophy match against Jammu and Kashmir at Srinagar in 1964. “I remember getting Sood in both the innings when I first played against Delhi (in 1962). He was a very friendly person with a great sense of humour. He did a superb job as a selector,” said former India captain and left-arm spinner Bishan Singh Bedi.

His lone Test appearance came against Richie Benaud-led Australia at Madras in 1960 when India lost by an innings and 55 runs. Sood fell to left-arm fast Alan Davidson in both the innings (0 and 3). In the first innings he was stumped by Wally Grout.

Remembering the dismissal, former India batsman Chandu Borde said, “Davidson used to bowl spin too at times and that’s why the scoreboard says stumped. Sood was a wonderful colleague with me in the selection committee (1985-86) and would come well-prepared. He was a fine batsman too.”

Popular in DDCA

Sood was a popular administrator at the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). “He backed the players always and was known for his cricketing acumen. A rare gentleman at the DDCA,” said former Test speedster Atul Wassan.

Sood served as an administrator at the DDCA and was respected by the players for his support. “He would take personal interest to ensure we got the best of facilities,” said former India all-rounder Manoj Prabhakar.

255,2020/01/19,A Rohit-Kohli show as India clinch the three-ODI series with a decisive chase against Australia,"Rohit Sharma’s love affair with the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium continued, while Virat Kohli made amends for his poor record at the venue. The duo came good on the day to power India to a seven-wicket win in the series-deciding third ODI against Australia here on Sunday.

Rohit, who has scored 44, 209 and 65 in his three previous ODIs at this venue, smacked an entertaining 128-ball 119. Unlike Rohit, Kohli did not enjoy a good ODI record in the city, with a highest score of 34 in five games here. The Indian captain set the record straight, registering a typically stylish 89.

A 137-run second-wicket partnership between Rohit and Kohli was instrumental in the home team reaching the 287-run target with 15 balls to spare. The pair made light of the absence of Shikhar Dhawan, who suffered a shoulder injury while fielding. Dhawan, seen sitting in the dressing room with his arm in a sling, was unable to bat.

All class

Rohit was all class from the start, cutting and driving the pacers Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc. He soon upped the ante, gaining maximums with a lofted back-foot shot and a perfectly-timed flick. Later on, when the spinners came on, the big crowd were treated to the power-hitting side of his batting. Even a marginally short delivery was dispatched deep into the mid-wicket stands.

The visitor could do little to stop the flow of runs, even after Rohit and Kohli were taken out. Shreyas Iyer (44 n.o.) was up to the task, completing the job with Manish Pandey (8 n.o.). After electing to bat, Australia rode on an excellent 131 from Steve Smith to post a good score. Smith came to the middle in the fourth over, after Mohammed Shami got David Warner to poke at a length ball outside off.

Tough going

The early going was tough for Smith —a terrible mix-up resulting in the run-out of captain Aaron Finch for 19. Smith was nearly involved in another run-out, when next man Marnus Labuschagne took on Yuzvendra Chahal’s throw from the deep. Bowler Kuldeep Yadav, however, failed to collect the throw and handed Labuschagne a life on eight.

The duo put on 127 for the third wicket, seeing Australia through a tricky phase. Smith was most efficient, avoiding risks while scoring at a brisk pace. He started with a controlled pull off Shami, consciously keeping the ball down to evade the fine-leg trap.

With the calling now sorted out, Smith and Labuschagne ran well between the wickets. At this stage, Australia looked set for a huge total, but Kohli put paid to these hopes. With a supremely athletic effort, he plucked a low catch at cover to remove Labuschagne. Labuschagne, who had struck the drive sweetly, could not believe his luck.

In a surprise move, Mitchell Starc came in at three-down as a pinch hitter, but the move did not work. His wild slog only went as far as deep mid-wicket, giving Ravindra Jadeja his second scalp of the over. Smith carried on, bringing up his ninth ODI ton. His last ODI century, incidentally, came exactly three years ago (against Pakistan at Perth). It took a fine running catch by Shreyas to end his stay. The fans, witness to a classy knock, applauded Smith as he walked off.

Mohammed Shami, whose quick yorkers blasted Pat Cummins and Adam Zampa out, finished with four for 63. Jasprit Bumrah went wicketless, but showed great control to concede just 38 runs in his 10 overs.

256,2020/01/19,"Dream come true, says Siddarth","It was an eventful day for debutant Tamil Nadu left-arm spinner M. Siddarth, who claimed 4/32 in 17.4 overs against Railways in the Ranji Trophy clash here on Sunday.

Siddarth ripped through the Railways top order and was well supported by R. Ashwin, who also took four wickets.

About the wicket, Siddarth said: “We don’t generally see the ball turn too much at the start of play. However, the pitch wasn’t a rank turner. The odd balls did turn and it worked in our favour.

“I wanted to vary the pace and bowl in the right areas. It gave me the desired results. This is one of my most memorable moments and being able to perform well in the Ranji Trophy was a dream come true. I will look forward to make a good contribution in the second innings as well.”

Long spells

Siddarth and Ashwin were bowling in tandem from the 13th over. About Ashwin, Siddarth said, “Ashwin is a legend and to be sharing the stage with someone with so much experience is an honour. He knows how to execute the plan perfectly and according to the match situation.”

On bowling 17 overs on the trot, Siddarth said, “I am used to bowling long spells from my junior days and it has become a habit. I am happy that I am able to contribute well in these spells.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dream-come-true-says-siddarth/article30600904.ece
257,2020/01/19,Vidarbha hits back to cut short Delhi’s joy,"Delhi’s joy of restricting Vidarbha to 179 proved short-lived as Aditya Thakare brought Vidarbha right back into its Ranji Trophy match by reducing the host to 41 for four at close of the opening day’s action at the Ferozshah Kotla ground here on Sunday.

On a grassy pitch, in cold conditions, Delhi could have done better after winning the toss but for a few slipped catches and veteran Wasim Jaffer’s classy innings of 83.

Simarjeet Singh proved Delhi’s spearhead as he removed openers Faiz Fazal and S. R. Ramaswamy and returned to put the finishing touches to Vidarbha innings with a four-wicket haul.

Ishant Sharma, who took three wickets, got the prized scalp of Jaffer. He bowled Jaffer just when the batsman was raising visions of his 41st century in the National championship.

Standing firm

On a bowler’s day, Jaffer’s knock stood out. He knew which deliveries to leave outside the off-stump and dealt well with Delhi’s all-pace attack. Walking in at 13 for one, Jaffer produced an innings of substance before his dismissal made it 162 for seven for Vidarbha. His 131-ball innings included 11 hits to the boundary.

When Delhi batted, things went smoothly until the first 22 runs before Thakare sent back four batsmen in the space of 13 runs.

With Umesh Yadav keeping up the pressure from the other end, Thakare claimed dividends for his disciplined line and incoming deliveries. He struck the most lethal blow with the one that forced skipper Dhruv Shorey to play and the resultant outside edge of the bat was taken by wicketkeeper.

With the conditions helping the pacers, Vidarbha will be looking to strike early on Monday to maximise its gains. Delhi, with in-from Nitish Rana still in, and three other batsmen capable of giving ample support, is not without hope of giving a better account of its batting.

258,2020/01/19,A special hundred for Abhinav Mukund,"Abhinav Mukund can surprise you. Expect him to grind out a hundred in his 100th Ranji Trophy match for Tamil Nadu and he can leave everyone stunned with a rousing onslaught to reach a century between lunch and tea.

A 100 in 100 it was for this old soldier for Tamil Nadu — actually Abhinav is only 30 — who appears to have been with the State side forever. Abhinav displayed no nerves during his 100th match. In fact, he celebrated the occasion.

“There was some bonhomie in the dressing room in the morning about my 100th Ranji match but that was about it. I wanted to make the occasion memorable,” he said.

Then he launched into the Railways attack. “This has to be among my best hundreds in the Ranji Trophy. I had never previously got a century in a session for State. I thought I batted fluently,” said the southpaw.

Remembering his long journey — Abhinav made his first class debut in 2007 — he said, “Getting into the Tamil Nadu side is so difficult in itself. And to stay there for so long is very satisfying,” he said.

Along the road, Abhinav recalled his triple hundred against Maharashtra in the Ranji Trophy. “That innings is still fresh in my mind,” Abhinav said.

This counter-puncher with a short-backlift and a big heart feels he can still make it to the Indian team. “Believing is everything,” he said.

259,2020/01/19,Manoj Tiwary shines with unbeaten ton in Ranji Trophy,"Manoj Tiwary is one of the more accomplished batsmen you would come across in the Ranji Trophy. Hyderabad’s bowlers were reminded of that fact at the Bengal Cricket Academy Ground on a mostly cool, cloudy Sunday.

His unbeaten 156 (212b, 357min, 15x4, 3x6) has put Bengal in a rather strong position by stumps on the opening day of the Group A match. A score of 366 for five must definitely be something the host would have taken when it chose to bat after winning the toss.

It may have been Tiwary’s intelligently paced innings that has put Hyderabad on to the back foot so early in the match, but Shreevats Goswami (95, 182b, 14x4) and Anustup Majumdar (59, 86b, 8x4) also deserve credit for lending their senior partner admirable support. At 60 for three, things could easily have gone wrong for Bengal.

Bad start

The host had begun disastrously, with opener Abhishek Raman edging Ravi Kiran behind in the very first over. Then captain Abhimanyu Easwaran, on whose head the crown seems to lie uneasily, fell lbw to a ball that kept low from Ravi Teja, as Bengal slid to 22 for two.

Then debutant Kazi Saifi, who was showing promise, was caught at slip off Saaketh Sai Ram in his first over. But strangely, the off-spinner was replaced in the very next over by left-arm tweaker Tanay Thyagarajan, who was greeted by Tiwary with a six over deep mid-on.

That was the stage of the match when Tiwary rightly decided counter-attacking was the best defence. It has been a magnificent innings; he gave one chance though to the covers off Ravi Teja, while on 48.

Goswami had no such luck though: he was caught smartly at slip by Saaketh off Ravi Kiran. But it was a mystery why he was so impatient to return to the dressing room, going for an unnecessary slash outside the off stump, with minutes left for the close.

Tiwary, who had reached his hundred with a four and a six, acknowledged the support he received from his partners. “This has already become one of my favourite knocks,” Tiwary said. “I had to keep on batting after losing those early wickets.”

The scores: Bengal – Ist Innings: Abhishek Raman c Sumanth b Ravi Kiran 0, Abhimanyu Easwaran lbw b Ravi Teja 12, Kazi Saifi c Jaweed b Saaketh 27, Manoj Tiwary (batting) 156, Anustup Majumdar c Sumanth b Mehdi 59, Shreevats Goswami c Saaketh b Ravi Kiran 95, Sheryan Chakraborty (batting) 0; Extras (b-12, lb-2, w-3) 17; Total (for five wkts. in 90 overs): 366.

A call on his participation in the match will be taken after further assessment, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said in a statement.

Dhawan was taken off the field after he got inured in the fifth over of the game at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.

“Shikhar Dhawan has gone for an x-ray. A call on him being available for the game will be taken once he is back and assessed,” the BCCI said.

The left-handed batsman had dived to save an Aaron Finch shot in the cover region before hurting his shoulder. He then walked out and was replaced by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal on the field.

261,2020/01/19,There is no doubt Dhoni will be retained by CSK in 2021: N. Srinivasan,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni “will be retained” by Chennai Super Kings in the 2021 IPL auctions irrespective of whether he plays for India again or not, asserted former BCCI president N. Srinivasan.

The lack of a BCCI central contract for the two-time former World Cup winning captain has sparked fresh rumours of his retirement in the last few days but Srinivasan, who is the vice-president and managing director of Indian Cements, owners of CSK, made it clear that Dhoni will continue to play for his franchise.

“People keep saying when will he... how long will he play, etc. He will play. I can assure you. He will play this year. Next year he will go (to) the auction; he will be retained. So there is no doubt in anybody’s mind,” Srinivasan said at an entrepreneurship event on Saturday.

Dhoni has been a part of CSK since the IPL’s inaugural edition in 2008 and apart from the two seasons when the franchise was suspended, the wicket-keeper batsman has led the team admirably, guiding it to three title triumphs.

The 38-year-old was on Thursday dropped from the BCCI’s list of centrally contracted players, raising fresh doubts on the future of the former India captain who has not played since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand in July last year.

Dhoni also recently returned to training, batting fluently in the Jharkhand team nets.

He was in the A category, which fetches a player ₹5 crore as annual retainership, until last year.

The vice-president of the CSK Fans Association A.R.R. Sriram was happy about Srinivasan’s statement.

“We are pretty sure that MS will be retained. There is no CSK without Dhoni. We won’t let him go into the auction pool,” Sriram said.

J. Sivakumar, an admirer of Dhoni and member of the fans club, echoed similar views and said the India Cements boss’ words were music to his ears.

Dhoni’s contract not being renewed was not exactly a surprise as he has not played a competitive game since that World Cup semifinal on July 9. He has been on an sabbatical and has refused to divulge his future plans.

One of the biggest names in Indian cricket, Dhoni led India to two world titles — the 2007 World T20 in South Africa and the 2011 ODI World Cup at home.

The veteran has played 90 Tests, 350 ODIs and 98 T20 Internationals for India, accumulating over 17,000 runs and effecting a staggering 829 dismissals behind the stumps.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/article23325620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MS%20Dhoni%20Chepauk,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/there-is-no-doubt-dhoni-will-be-retained-by-csk-in-2021-n-srinivasan/article30599472.ece
262,2020/01/19,Indian team sports black arm bands in honour of Bapu Nadkarni,"Members of the Indian cricket team on January 19 sported black arm bands to honour former all-rounder Bapu Nadkarni, who died earlier this week.

Nadkarni was 86 and is survived by his wife and two daughters. He breathed his last on January 17.

The Indian team took the field for the series-deciding third ODI against Australia wearing black arm bands as a mark of respect for Nadkarni.

Nadkarni, a left-handed batsman and slow-left arm orthodox bowler, played 41 Tests in which he scored 1,414 runs and grabbed 88 wickets with 6/43 as his best bowling figures.

Nadkarni was a Mumbai stalwart having played 191 first-class matches and taken 500 wickets and scored 8,880 runs.

The Nashik-born Nadkarni made his Test debut against New Zealand in Delhi in 1955 and played his last Test at Auckland against the same opponents in 1968 under MAK Pataudi’s captaincy.

He rose to fame after he bowled 21 successive maidens.

263,2020/01/19,Ranji Trophy: Bengal desperately seeks a win,"“Bengal lost to Vidarbha inside two days, right?” said the cab driver. “But Hyderabad is playing even worse.”

You don’t exactly expect the average Indian cricket fan to follow the domestic cricket so well, but then this is Kolkata, a city that is more passionate about sport than any other in the country.

That statement by the knowledgeable cricket fan, namely Krishna Chhetri, during the drive from the airport to this small city on the eastern side of Hoogly River, just about sums up the scenario ahead of the Ranji Trophy match between Bengal and Hyderabad, which gets underway at the Bengal Cricket Academy Ground on Sunday.

The host’s coach Arun Lal is still smarting from that nine-wicket defeat to the defending champion at Nagpur last week.

“It was prepared as a square-turner,” said the former India opener. “All the teams in the Ranji Trophy are so desperate for wins that they try to make wickets that don’t last the full four days.”

Sporting wicket

It was in search of a win that Bengal moved this match from the Eden Gardens, though.

“It would always either be a seaming track or a flat wicket at the Eden Gardens,” reasoned Lal.

“I was hoping we would get more turn from this wicket, but it looks like a good one for batting for the first two days, and the spinners could come into play only later.”

Setback

The coach admits the absence of Ishan Porel, who is in New Zealand with the India A team, is a setback. And he wants Abhimanyu Easwaran to start scoring heavily once again.

“I hope he isn’t burdened by the captaincy,” he said.

The skipper may not have scored a fifty yet this season, but his team is reasonably placed still with 12 points from four games. Hyderabad, on the other hand, has just six points from five matches — it lost four of them — and is placed 16th among the 18 teams that make up Group A and B.

Like Bengal, it also has to overcome the loss of a key pace bowler to the India A team — Mohammed Siraj, who had taken seven wickets in the team’s solitary win, against Kerala.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/iwfa99/article30598275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19-BEN-HYD-CUGC770C33G3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bengal-desperately-seeking-a-win/article30599085.ece
264,2020/01/19,Ranji Trophy | Tamil Nadu has to get its act together,"It’s time Tamil Nadu delivered collectively. So far, this Ranji season, the side has been performing in fits and starts.

Dinesh Karthiik conjured a fabulous hundred in the marquee clash against Karnataka at Dindigul but there was none to support him. When somebody else put his hand up for the side, the others did not respond. This is a sign of a struggling side.

The host has to get its act together against Railways in the Ranji Elite clash beginning at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium from Sunday.

Tamil Nadu has just five points from five, while Railways has 13 from an equal number of games.

Indeed, the different arms of this Tamil Nadu team have not moved in cohesion. And the team is coming up short at crunch times, unable to drive home its advantage.

Bereft of ideas

The attack appears to run out of ideas when up against a right-left combination.

Tamil Nadu has to find answers, even if it only has the slimmest of chances for qualification following a disastrous start.

Lively left-armer T. Natarajan, likely to be the lone paceman in the XI on what could be a spinner-friendly surface, can also create the rough for off-spin ace R. Ashwin to exploit.

Tamil Nadu has strength in batting but the likes of Abhinav Mukund, the Baba brothers, Dinesh Karthik, and the in-form Kaushik Gandhi will have to fire together. The emphasis should be on patience, right shot selection and building partnerships.

Combative team

Railways is a combative team. The side, however, is not without chinks in batting.

While Dinesh Mor is the leading scorer with 315 at 52.50, the next highest aggregate is that of Karn Sharma, better known for his leg-spin, with 244.

However, in a blow for Railways, Karn is grappling with a shoulder injury and is unavailable against Tamil Nadu. Railways has been dependent on its pacemen — Himanshu Sangwan (25 scalps), T. Pradeep (21) and Amit Mishra (21) — this season.

The seamers will be tested here.

Tamil Nadu has to develop killer instinct.

265,2020/01/19,Coimbatore’s wait for defence sector opportunities continues,"It was in 2018 that Coimbatore’s aspiration to become a manufacturing hub for the defence sector got much visibility as the then Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman assured her support to Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) that wanted to supply to the sector.

With a few companies, with different scales of manufacturing, already supplying to the defence sector, the industry had made a presentation to the Minister on the manufacturing capabilities of Coimbatore in the sector. The aim was to provide new opportunities to the MSMEs by supporting them to tap the potential in the defence sector.

Since then there had been meetings, project proposals, exhibitions, awareness programmes, and several efforts to bring to the city a Defence Innovation Hub and an incubation facility. Last year, the Tamil Nadu Defence Corridor was also launched, including Coimbatore in the corridor.

At present, less than 50 companies are supplying to the defence sector.

Detailed project report

The Coimbatore District Small Industries Association (Codissia) has submitted detailed project reports (DPR) for both the projects - the Defence Innovation Hub is a ₹45-crore project with ₹15 crore coming as grant, ₹5 crore as soft loan, ₹10 crore from the Atal Innovation Mission and another ₹10 crore and land and building from the Association. The other is the incubation facility in which the Government and the Association will contribute ₹10 crore each during a period of five years. The Government has approved both the project reports. But, it has decided to combine both. Hence, the final nod is awaited, industry sources said.

According to R. Ramamoorthy, president of Codissia, the innovation and incubation facilities will be housed in the same building. While the innovation centre will work on 70 products for the defence sector, the incubation facility will incubate seven projects a year. “Over a period of time, with several meetings, the projects have evolved. When approved and implemented, this project with both, the innovation and incubation facilities in the same building, will be the first of its kind in the country for the defence sector,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Association is co-ordinating with the Defence agencies. It is sourcing the tender documents and sharing with its members here so that they get an idea about the scope, their manufacturing capabilities and where the industry needs to improve, Mr. Ramamoorthy added.

The Codissia formed a single company, combining both the projects, a year ago and it is now trying to involve start-ups and commence works on defence projects possible. The Defence project was aimed at the future, to give a boost to the MSMEs here. However, with the current slowdown and hardly any signs of revival of demand, the manufacturing units here need the domestic Defence sector to take off so that they get orders, an industry source said.

Sub-contract opportunities

The Coimbatore Tirupur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneur Association (COTMA) president C. Sivakumar said that only if the big companies get orders from the defence sector would the micro units get sub-contract opportunities. At present, units that were already supplying to defence continue to do so and the volume was not much. “It is very difficult for the micro sector to supply directly to the defence. Recently, we participated in a meeting with the Railways and some of us visited Perambur too. But, they are taking a lot of time to even finalise vendors and it involves a lot of procedures,” he said.

Common facilities

Another industry source said that MSMEs were reluctant to invest on their own in defence product manufacturing as the volume required was minimum. For some products they need to invest in drawing and developing a prototype and it was expensive. Common facilities would help in developing such products. “The ecosystem has to develop and it will take time. If the entire MSME segment here should benefit from the defence sector, the common facilities should take off,” the source said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/yhtov5/article30602224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB20VISUALEDUCATIONAIDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatores-wait-for-defence-sector-opportunities-continues/article30602225.ece

The Corporation had seized the one-time use plastic goods that the State government had banned January 1, 2019 onwards and they included carry bags, spoons and plastic-coated paper cups.

Sources in the company said it would segregate and shred the plastic goods, mix it with bitumen at a certain proportion and then add a patented stabiliser to produce polymer modified bitumen (PMB) cubes of 11 kg each.

The seized plastic that the Corporation handed over to the company would help it produce around 300 such cubes, which would then be mixed with pre-heated bitumen to lay roads.

The sources said the company had supplied to the PMB cubes to contractors engaged to lay rural roads under various Central and State government schemes.

They also said that the Corporation had also approached the company to supply the cubes to its contractors for lay such roads in Coimbatore.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corporation-sells-19-tonnes-of-seized-plastic-goods/article30597346.ece

The detention orders were served on the trio on Saturday at the Coimbatore Central Prison where they are currently lodged in judicial custody, said the police.

A statement issued by the police said that Police Commissioner Sumit Sharan issued orders invoking provisions of the Goondas Act against the three accused -- Subash, former employee of the fuel station who shot the video in his mobile phone, journalist K. Maruthachalam, who allegedly used the video for a news report in a web channel, and a 35-year-old man from Rathinapuri, husband of one the affected women, who allegedly shared the video to the journalist.

273,2020/01/19,Dusty roads trouble Vadavalli residents,"In Kare Gowder Layout, Kalveerampalayam, Vadavalli, every passing vehicle, be it a two-wheeler or a four-wheeler, leaves a trail of dust.

The dust that is kicked up from the under-construction road appears as though the place is covered with fog. It is takes about two minutes for the dust to settle down, rues S. Ramalingam, a resident of the nearby Thoppil Nagar, where the problem is no different from the Layout.

The residents of the Layout, Thoppil Nagar and a few other areas in Vadavalli – Wards 16 and 17 of the Coimbatore Corporation – have been living with the problem for about a month now, after the civic body started work to re-build roads.

Ever since the work started, we have been covered under a blanket of dust that gets settled on almost everything both within and without houses, says K. Maragatham, a resident of the Layout. The dust has also left the residents, young and old alike, coughing and having breathing problems.

Mr. Ramalingam says the children find it difficult to play outside. For Kare Gowder Layout resident R. Ramanathan even riding his scooter on the road has become a problem. Aside from the dust, the loose stones pose a challenge to rider’s safety, he complains.

In the Layout’s main road the dust never settles because it is one of the approach roads that takes motorists to Marudhamalai Road. As vehicles keep moving, the dust gets kicked up even before it is settled, he adds.

The problem in Thoppil Nagar is the same and road users in the neighbourhood use the road to reach Marudhamalai Road, Mr. Ramalingam complements.

The Coimbatore Corporation officials say that the contractor engaged to lay roads in the area had spread wet mix macadem – a mixture of blue metal and quarry dust – to prepare the ground. Only after the wet mix macadem settles on the road, will they complete the work by adding the bitumen top.

The completion work will start by Monday and get over in a week thereafter, they add.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/6bcgyq/article30596549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB19KAREGOWDERLAYOUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/dusty-roads-trouble-vadavalli-residents/article30596550.ece
274,2020/01/19,Give list of govt. bungalows under illegal occupation: Delhi HC,"The Delhi High Court has asked the Centre to give details of the government bungalows in the national capital which are being occupied by persons who are no longer MPs, MLAs or bureaucrats.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar wanted to know the details of the alleged illegal occupants of official accommodation and if the occupants were holding any post and how long they had been in illegal occupancy.

“Lot of people are occupying government bungalows without holding any post,” the court observed, while giving an oral direction to the Centre.

It gave the direction while hearing a petition on illegal occupancy.

The court also issued notice to the Centre, the Delhi government and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on a fresh petition seeking official residential accommodation for judicial officers. It listed both cases together for hearing on February 5.

The latest plea contended that several judicial officers did not have an official residence, due to which they have to opt for rented accommodation at far off places.

The petition claimed that it results in hardship not only to the judicial officer, but also litigants, accused, lawyers and police officers who may have to urgently move the judge at his home for any interim relief or order.

The plea further said 126 judicial officers were appointed by a notification dated May 21, 2019, but no government accommodation was available to them.

It has sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government to provide official residential accommodation to the Delhi Judicial Service officers by purchasing, at concessional rates, around 140 CWG flats available with the DDA.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/p94jk/article29753637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/give-list-of-govt-bungalows-under-illegal-occupation-delhi-hc/article30600819.ece
275,2020/01/19,"AAP government ‘trying to save’ Nirbhaya case convicts, alleges BJP","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday accused the Arvind Kejriwal-led government of ‘trying to save’ the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape case instead of ensuring justice to her family, as it trained guns at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) over delay in their hanging.

At a press conference held at the party headquarters, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari also condemned the suggestion made by senior lawyer Indira Jaising to pardon the Nirbhaya convicts, and questioned her links with the Arvind Kejriwal government.

Mr. Tiwari also referred to Ms. Jaising’s representations of Mr. Kejriwal’s government in the past as he sought to put the AAP dispensation in the dock over her remarks.

“The Tihar jail comes under the Delhi government, and the convicts, who should have been informed about the 2017 verdict soon after, were informed two years later in 2019,” Mr. Tiwari claimed.

“It shows that first the AAP-led government delayed the hanging and now trying to save the four convicts,” he alleged. “And then, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia holds a press conference to say, ‘police is delaying’ the proceedings,” Mr. Tiwari added.

A 23-year-old paramedic student, who came to be known as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons, including the four death row convicts, before being thrown out on the road. She succumbed to her injuries a fortnight later at a hospital in Singapore.

Nirbhaya’s father on Saturday had said that Ms. Jaising should be ashamed of herself for suggesting pardon for the four convicts in his daughter’s gruesome gangrape case and added that his family is not as ‘large-hearted’ as Congress leader Sonia Gandhi.

He also demanded an apology from Ms. Jaising, who is known for her stand against capital punishment.

In a tweet on Friday, Ms. Jaising has said that she fully identifies with the pain of Nirbhaya’s mother and urged her to follow the example of Sonia Gandhi who forgave Nalini (one of the seven life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination) and said she did not want death penalty for her.

“We are with you but against death penalty,” she said.

BJP national general secretary Saroj Pandey and party leader Shazia Ilmi were also present during the press conference.

Ms. Pandey also sought to link suggestion made by Ms. Jaising to the AAP government and said, “This is the worst form of politics.”

“Jaising herself is a woman, she should have thought a thousand times before making that suggestion. And, people very well know her link with the AAP... We condemn this,” she added.

Ms. Pandey said that Nirbhaya’s mother and her family, and the entire country waited for justice for them, but it is being delayed. Ms. Ilmi also linked the senior lawyer’s remarks and her prior association with the Kejriwal-led party. She alleged that the Kejriwal government had changed the Tihar Jail Manual, and a notice was to given to the convicts when their appeals were rejected by a court in 2017, upholding the sentence awarded earlier.

“That notice was to be given in May 2017 but instead given to them in October 2019. Isn’t that a criminal lapse?” Ms. Ilmi added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nighd8/article28116178.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-MANOJTIWARI-SKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-government-trying-to-save-nirbhaya-case-convicts-alleges-bjp/article30600260.ece
276,2020/01/19,JNUSU to move high court on Jan. 19 for quashing new hostel manual,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union on January 19 said it will approach the Delhi High Court on January 20 seeking a direction for quashing the new hostel manual which has provisions for fee hike.

In a statement, the students’ body said it will be filing the plea on Monday against the Inter-Hall Administration (IHA) manual which, it claimed, was passed “illegally” in October without taking the feedback of the Union.

The petition shall also seek registration at “old rates without late fines”, they said.

The JNUSU, which has been on a strike on the issue for close to three months, urged the students to continue the boycott of registration and all academic activities.

Early this month, the university had witnessed tussle between student groups over the issue of registration. Amid the stir, masked men had gone on a rampage on January 5 in the campus assaulting students and teachers and storming hostels, drawing widespread outrage.

The JNUSU also appealed to students to boycott exams and classes till they get “buffer time” to complete the academic backlog of the Monsoon Semester 2019.

“Furthermore, taking exams and/or classes at this juncture will only create more chaos and ruckus and lead to another bifurcation in the student community that has been resolutely and unitedly fighting tooth and nail against this draconian VC and his political masters,” the JNUSU said.

They also demanded that the JNU administration “annul and completely quash all punitive actions on students who have been struggling against the exorbitant fee hike”.

According to the agitating students, they were not invited to the meeting where the IHA Manual was passed, which according to them has provisions for hostel fee hike and no reservation policy for students from marginalised sections for getting hostel accommodation.

The university had offered a partial rollback of fee hike by offering relaxation for students belonging to below poverty line (BPL) category in November.

When the agitation by students refused to end, the administration had formed a high-level committee to discuss the revised hostel manual and hostel charges.

The committee had recommended that the utility and service charge be reduced from ₹2,000 per month to ₹1,000 for all students.

The Human Resource Development Ministry had also intervened and held negotiations with the administration and students. It had said that the UGC will take care of the service and utility charges.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7bvek4/article30600063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnusu-to-move-high-court-on-jan-19-for-quashing-new-hostel-manual/article30600064.ece
277,2020/01/19,Air India reinstates senior pilot found guilty of sexual harassment,"A senior Air India pilot who was suspended in May last year after being accused of sexual harassment by a woman colleague was found guilty by an internal committee of the airline but has been reinstated recently, senior officials said.

The committee imposed a “major penalty” on Captain Sachin Gupta, who has now appealed to the next authority against the punishment, they said.

In response to specific queries on the matter, P S Negi, Regional Director (Northern Region), Air India, told PTI, “The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) of Air India conducted the enquiry proceedings and found Captain Sachin Gupta guilty of the charges of misconduct.”

The immediate competent disciplinary authority has imposed a “major penalty” as per the company’s service regulation that is applicable to Captain Sachin Gupta, he said.

“In keeping with these service regulations, Captain Sachin Gupta has now appealed to the next higher authority/CMD (Chairman and Managing Director) against the punishment awarded. The said appeal on merit will be examined and considered by the competent appellate authority in due course of time,” he added.

Another senior Air India official told PTI on condition of anonymity that Gupta has been “reinstated as instructor“.

Air India had suspended Gupta last year over the sexual harassment allegations, telling him that “pending (an) enquiry... during the period of suspension, you (Gupta) will not enter the premises of Air India Limited without written permission“.

According to a complaint filed by the woman pilot, the alleged incident took place on May 5 last year in Hyderabad, where she was being trained by Gupta.

“I was left shocked at this behaviour and felt extremely uncomfortable, scared and humiliated,” she said.

The woman said she felt “morally obliged” to report the matter to the airline so that such behaviour is not repeated with anyone else in the future.

On May 16 last year, Air India CMD Ashwani Lohani had told employees that sexual harassment cases are “often” being witnessed at Air India and the airline needs to come down “very, very heavily” on such offenders.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/d54llv/article30599114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19AIRINDIA-STAKESALE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/air-india-reinstates-senior-pilot-found-guilty-of-sexual-harassment/article30599107.ece
278,2020/01/19,There must be a system to ensure rape convicts are punished within 6 months: Kejriwal,"Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said a system needs to be developed to ensure that rape convicts are punished within six months.

Reacting to the verdict in the 2013 Gandhi Nagar rape case, Mr. Kejriwal said it took seven years to find the accused guilty.

“We need to all come together and correct this system. If we want to ensure that no one misbehaves with our sisters and daughters we need to develop a system that ensures that the accused are punished within six months,” he tweeted.

Two men accused of kidnapping and raping a five-year-old girl in Delhi in 2013 were held guilty on Saturday by a city court.

The girl was raped in April 2013, four months after a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, Nirbhaya, was raped on December 16, 2012, in a running bus in south Delhi’s Munirka.

Nirbhaya had succumbed to injuries in Singapore hospital. All four surviving convicts in the Nirbhaya case have been ordered to be hanged till death on February 1.

279,2020/01/19,"Sisodia slams BJP, Cong. over private schools","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Saturday attacked the BJP and Congress over private schools turning into just “profit-making businesses” in States ruled by them.

It also challenged the two parties to show at least one State where excess fee charged by private schools had been refunded.

“Earlier, families of politicians ran private schools... in these areas, government schools were closed,” senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia said, adding: “In the last five years, we did not allow private schools to be just profit-making businesses.”

The Education Minister said that 198 private schools in Delhi had refunded ₹32 crore to 78,000 students, “a first in anywhere in India”.

“In Delhi, 364 schools are on government land... they were given land either for ₹1 or at highly subsidised rates during the 1970s and 1980s... as per the agreement, the schools can only increase the fee after taking permission from the government. But till 2015, nobody used this clause,” said Mr. Sisodia.

He added that before 2015, such schools were increasing fees by 12%-15% every year, “which translates to a 75% increase over five years”. “In 2016-17, we invoked the clause and out of 364 schools, 334 were not allowed to increase the fee,” he said.

Mr. Sisodia added that in 2017-18 and 2018-19, no school was allowed to increase the fee and in 2019-20 also only 309 were not permitted to increase the fee.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gi37mx/article30598822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19DESISO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sisodia-slams-bjp-cong-over-private-schools/article30598823.ece

282,2020/01/19,AAP MLA Adarsh Shastri joins Cong.,"Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA from Dwarka Adarsh Shastri joined the Congress on Saturday following which he accused AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal of “flouting all democratic norms to sell tickets for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections for ₹10 crore to ₹20 crore”.

Welcoming Mr. Shastri into the party fold, Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra termed it a “ghar wapsi”. He also attacked the Delhi government for “failing on all fronts, throwing its idealism to the winds, indulging in corruption, and exhibiting total indifference towards the the people of Delhi”.

“The Kejriwal-led government came to power with the specific agenda of ending corruption and implementing Swaraj and Lokpal... though it has passed the Lokpal Bill in the Assembly, the AAP government has not taken any step to enforce it... the irony is that after being in power for five years, Kejriwal himself has become a symbol of corruption,” Mr. Chopra said.

Mr. Shastri attacked the CM for “belittling the self-respect” of his party’s legislators. He said he had left his job with a multinational company to join AAP as he had thought that an “honest man would herald clean politics”. “I changed my opinion of AAP after it sold tickets through two MPs, instead of giving them to committed AAP volunteers... there was huge corruption in AAP’s ticket distribution for the municipal polls,” Mr. Shastri alleged.

“Mr. Kejriwal will be best remembered for spreading corruption in politics... I had requested him to give tickets to devoted AAP workers, but he instead sold them for ₹10 crore to ₹20 crore... Kejriwal treats MLAs like bonded labour,” he said.

A speeding car had hit the woman from behind when she was walking to a nearby place from her house. She suffered fracture in the leg and other injuries.

The Presiding Officer of the Tribunal, Paramjit Singh, decided the claim amount, and the liability of the insurance company of the offending vehicle, on the basis of the evidence presented by the injured petitioner.

The Tribunal, however, allowed the insurance company to recover the compensation amount from the driver and the owner of the offending car as the driver could not prove that he had a valid licence at the time of the accident.

Complainant L.G. Dass from Delhi said despite reserving an AC III-tier berth by paying ₹450 for travel between Jalandhar to Ambala, he found that the berth occupied by another passenger.

“He was shocked to see that a lady was sleeping on the berth and on being asked to vacate the same, she insulted the complainant. After much insistence, the lady showed two tickets to the complainant...issued by the Railways for allotting the same berth and coach,” the Bench observed while noting the allegations in the plea.

“In these peculiar circumstances, the complainant had no option but to accommodate the lady and allow her to use his berth which caused him physical and mental pain during the five-hour journey and the coach attendant even refused to provide the complaint book to the complainant,” the Bench added.

287,2020/01/19,Congress names 54 in first list,"The Delhi Congress on Saturday released its first list of 54 candidates for the February 8 Assembly elections.

The list is a mix of Congress veterans, leaders who have switched over from the Aam Aadmi Party, as well as first-timers and new faces.

The party has not declared candidates for 16 seats, including the New Delhi constituency from where AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal is contesting.

The party is also in talks with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) for a seat-share in four to five seats in areas dominated by Purvanchalis.

Names of city unit chief Subhash Chopra and other senior leaders like Ajay Maken and J.P. Aggarwal who had fought the Lok Sabha election are not in the list.

The party has fielded former Union Minister Krishna Tirath from Patel Nagar and former Delhi Minister Arvinder Lovely from Gandhi Nagar. Former Delhi Minister Ashok Kumar Walia will contest from Krishna Nagar constituency. All three working presidents of the Delhi Congress when Sheila Dikshit was the party chief have been given tickets. Haroon Yusuf will contest from Ballimaran; Rajesh Lilothia from Mongolpuri; and Devender Yadav from Badli.

Former AAP leader Alka Lamba, who switched over to the Congress, has been fielded from Chandni Chowk; AAP’s Dwarka MLA Adarsh Shastri, who joined the party on Saturday, was given a ticket from the constituency.

Mr. Shastri, the grandson of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, also held the posts of national spokesperson and co-convener of overseas affairs cell of the Aam Aadmi Party.

Election campaign committee chairman Kirti Azad’s wife Poonam Azad will contest from Sangam Vihar. She will be among six women candidates that have been declared in the first list. The party has fielded Lakshman Rawat against Manish Sisodia from Patparganj.

The Congress has looked towards young candidates in Abhishek Dutt from Karturba Nagar, Radhika Khera from Janakpuri and Delhi Congress chief Shubhash Chopra’s daughter Shivani Chopra from Kalkaji.

In the 2015 Delhi Assembly elections, the Congress failed to win a single seat.

However, in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, it improved its voteshare and was in second place in five out of the seven seats, giving the party hope that it will be able to win back its support that moved to AAP in 2015.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wz5var/article30597289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHI-DECIDER-LOGO-singlecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/congress-names-54-in-first-list/article30597291.ece

The police here contacted the SHO of Morkahi police station in Khagaria and informed him about the child. The boy’s picture was shared on WhatsApp.

“The boy’s family members could not be contacted by the SHO there due to distance of the villages from police station Morkahi and odd timings,” the DCP said. Following this, efforts were made to contact other authorities in the district.

291,2020/01/19,2013 Gandhi Nagar rape convict assaults journalist,"A journalist, who was reporting on the proceedings at Karkardooma Court for the 2013 Gandhi Nagar rape case, was assaulted by one of the convicts on Saturday afternoon, the police said.

The woman, working with television media, said all the reporters were outside the courtroom when the incident happened.

Many journalists were recording convict Pradeep being escorted out of the courtroom by police officers when he started abusing the mediapersons.

Convict turns violent

The convict then suddenly turned violent and attacked the journalist, she told the police.

The reporter said he first slapped her and then hit her arm after which her phone, with which she was recording the video, fell on the floor.

The woman then submitted a complaint with the police regarding the attack after which she was taken for medical examination.

The police said a case under Sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against Pradeep.

292,2020/01/19,Anti-CAA demonstration at Jama Masjid,"Hundreds of people gathered at Jama Masjid on Saturday to register their protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

A candlelight march was also organised by the Not In My Name campaign, from Lal Kuan to Jama Masjid.

“When Mahatma Gandhi kept his last fast in this city, between January 13 and January 18, 1948, there was hatred being spread everywhere. It was similar to the kind of hatred we are seeing today. He broke his fast only after the signing of the Delhi declaration where two of the signatories were the RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha.It was because of this fast that Mahatma Gandhi was killed a few days later and that hatred is still affecting us to this day,” said Rahul Roy, co-organiser of the campaign.

“Hindustan hum sabka hain (India belongs to each one of us),” said Mr. Roy amid cheers from the crowd. “The Constitution is the only document which has tied the nation together,” he added.

‘Our kids are not safe’

Fareeda Begum, a resident of Matia Mahal who had come to the protest, said: “We have been coming here for the last one month. Why are Narendra Modi and Amit Shah doing this to us? Our kids are not safe and are not able to study. We all saw what happened at Jamia Millia Islamia... our parents do not even know where their [birth, residence] documents are. What do we do?”

Rihana, a housewife, said: “We will continue the demonstrations as long as we live. If the Prime Minister and the Home Minister are adamant about not revoking the new law, then we want to tell them that we are equally adamant. We will not move till CAA is revoked.”

Another resident of the area, 65-year-old Fasloor Rahman, said: “My parents were not educated and I have lived here my entire life. So what happens to me if I cannot provide documents? Do I have to go to a detention centre? Amid children being sexually exploited to massive unemployment in the country, the government brings in this new law.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vh98tt/article30597237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19DEJAMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/anti-caa-demonstration-at-jama-masjid/article30597238.ece
293,2020/01/19,"DU takes a leaf out of JNU, JMI to raise protest banner","The ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and violence on universities across the country have triggered unprecedented demonstrations at Delhi University.

Recently, the university’s North Campus witnessed one of the largest mobilisation of students on January 8 when thousands of them took out a rally here.

Boycotting classes

The students of St. Stephen’s College had on the same day boycotted their classes to hold a public meeting where they read out the Preamble to protest CAA. Some students of Jesus & Mary College (JMC) have been holding regular silent demonstrations outside their college for at least a week now.

In protest against the CAA, students of colleges such as Ram Lal Anand College, Ramjas College, Hansraj College, Indraprastha College for Women, Dyal Singh College, Zakir Husain Delhi College also held public meetings.

“At Jawaharlal Nehru University [JNU], at Aligarh Muslim University [AMU], we know that there will be protests but the Delhi University has a very diverse composition with a huge number of right-wing members. So, the students of DU holding such protests is very heartening,” said former president of Delhi University Teachers’ Association (DUTA) Nandita Narain.

‘Seriousness of situation’

With the violence at Jamia Milia Islamia (JMI) and JNU, Ms. Narain said: “Some ice had broken. Some students would protest up to a point but not come out on the streets for the same. Now, they are willing to come out because they are seeing how serious the situation is...Because you feel anybody could be a target and they don’t want to lose freedom of expression. If everything becomes a farce, then there is no point in having a university.”

The university, however, has not been a stranger to large scale protests, she said highlighting similar large scale mobilisation during violence at Ramjas College. However, then there were more people from the city as opposed to the number of students, she added.

Other stakeholders at DU also argued that there has been a fundamental change. Aditya Krishnan, a student of MA history at the university, said it the protests erupted as if a powder keg had gone off. He called violence at JMI and JNU “an Enfield rifle moment”. “I came to protests the passing of Article 370 but at that time, there very few people...around 50-70. At that time, I thought India had lost the art of protest. I never expected this,” he said. Commenting on the lack of such mobilisation in the past, student-activist Kawalpreet Kaur said there was a kind of apathy among students which restricted them from taking to the streets.

“Earlier, they did not care what is happening in society,” she said, adding that a change was seen in the last few years. The fear of violence by ABVP members (like the one in JNU) was a cause of concern, she said, adding: “But now the fear has gone.”

“Shaheen Bagh has been a big example. It has been a motivation for the students that people coming out and reclaiming their own spaces, their own streets. It sends out a message that they should not fear anymore,” she said.

Others such as Komal Rawat from Campus Law Centre (CLC) and Amaiya Sharma from Miranda House College said the dominance of the right-wing student group ABVP and fear of violence were reasons for the lack of such demonstrations.

“Now we have seen such attacks right here on the campus and you feel like it might happen to you,” said Ms. Sharma, who was participating in the protests here for the first time. Ms. Rawat said concerns about maintaining a 70% attendance record and the fact that the university is not a closed campus like JNU were hindrances to large scale mobilisation.

Similar protests

Women’s rights activist and teacher at JMC Maya John pointed out at some instances of large scale demonstrations in the past, such as when students came out commemorating violence during the Babri Masjid demolition and others.

But with the current protests, the participation of colleges such as JMC and Delhi School of Economics was unprecedented, she said. She said protests against the CAA and National Register for Citizens (NRC) are very emotive. The continuous protests, debates and dialogues especially in universities like JMI and JNU where students were attacked, had been a trigger for the DU students, she said.

Ms. John believed that the current protests were a culmination of various atrocities allegedly committed by the current government. She said people have been watching this government closely and felt strongly about what it has done in Kashmir, its duplicity...whatever the students have seen in the last two-three months, have agitated them.

Stakeholders of the university believe that the protests will continue. Many said if even if mobilisation does not take place at the university-level, scores of simultaneous stirs taking place across the city would see participation and support from the students here.

294,2020/01/19,Action and consequence,"Sukracharya warns Mahabali not to give land to Vamana. He says that Vamana is none other than Vishnu Himself. But Bali says that if indeed Vamana is Vishnu, then it is an honour for Bali to be asked to give something to Him. Sukracharya, taking the form of a bee, blocks the outlet in the vessel of water, for without the pouring of water, no ‘daana’ is complete. Vishnu uses a blade of grass to poke Sukracharya’s eye and blinds him. Periyazhvar, describing this incident, lauds the Lord as the One with the Sudarsana in His hand. The Lord did not use His discus, but used a piece of grass. Periyazhvar speaks of Sudarshana in this context to show that whatever the Lord uses as a weapon, Sudarsana is present in it, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse.

Sukracharya was only telling the truth when he warned Bali about Vamana. Not a word of what he said was untrue. Vamana was indeed Vishnu, and He had indeed come to deprive Bali of territory over which he was ruling. So, why was Sukracharya punished for being honest? Why did he lose an eye? This was a question once posed by a sishya to his guru. The latter answered that it was a sin to stop ‘daana’, and that is what Sukracharya had attempted. That is why he was punished. Then the sishya asked, “If, as you say, ‘daana’ is so virtuous, why was Bali punished? After he only gave to Vamana.”

The guru replied, “It is important to obey one’s guru, because he always has his sishya’s welfare in mind. Sukracharaya advised Bali not to trust Vamana and tried his best to prevent him from giving land to Vamana. But Bali paid no attention to his guru. So, for the sin of disobeying his guru, he was punished.” So, for every sin, there is some punishment. No one can escape the consequence of his or her actions.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/action-and-consequence/article30601851.ece

There are two traffic diversions that are causing severe traffic delays and inconvenience to commuters at the HiTec City area. Traffic is being diverted via a dirt road opposite Radisson Hotel towards Rolling Meadows and Ramky Towers. The road is hardly in a motorable condition and there is no signage to indicate the new diversion. Similarly, traffic is being diverted to another dirt road adjacent to the new Meenakshi-Deloitte Towers due to APTransco cable laying work. These diversions are being created without proper alternative arrangements that pose risk to the safety of commuters.

296,2020/01/19,Family robbed in South Africa to get ₹2 lakh compensation,"A city-based family, which was robbed during a trip to South Africa, was in for a relief after a consumer forum ruled that the agency which had arranged for their travel cannot wash their hands off of the safety of their customers. The forum ordered the company to pay ₹2 lakh as compensation and ₹70,000 towards loss of property.

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Hyderabad – III was dealing with a complaint filed by Avinash Gupta (64) who said he had approached Beacon Holidays Pvt. Ltd. for a 10-day South Africa package tour. It included round-trip tickets, accommodation and entry tickets to certain places, for which ₹3.46 lakh was paid.

However, on June 18, 2016, the last day of their trip, after they had checked out of their hotel, the car in which they were travelling was intercepted by unknown persons who robbed them of their valuables and $600. The complainant also alleged that the driver was in cahoots with those who had robbed them.

A complaint was registered at a local police station. The incident was also brought to the attention of the Tourism Business Council of South Africa.

For its part, the travel agency stated that this was the first time that their customers had been robbed. They also said that their South African vendors are persons of repute and that they are not responsible for the robbery.

Taking submissions of both parties into consideration, the forum stated that the travel agency cannot wash its hands off of the ‘ill fated incident’ and that the complainant is liable to be compensated on a ‘non-standard basis’.

298,2020/01/19,How did TRS get ₹188 crore donations this year: Revanth,"Telangana Congress working president and Malkajgiri MP, A. Revanth Reddy, wanted to know how come the donations to TRS party had increased to ₹188 crore this year from ₹ 24 crore last year.

“When the economy is down, who is donating to the party,” he asked, and alleged that the TRS collected money through electoral bonds for which it need not furnish the details.

In an open letter to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Mr. Reddy also demanded an inquiry into the increase in the assets of TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao from ₹8 crore in 2014 to ₹ 41 crore in 2018. Or else, I will approach the court seeking a direction for inquiry, he said.

He claimed that the sudden increase of assets is suspicious and the market value is much more than what was declared in the affidavits filed during the Assembly elections.

Mr. Reddy reminded Mr. Rao’s repeated statements of not sparing even his family members if found indulging in corruption, and said the Chief Minister has the moral responsibility to respond to the letter.

The Malkajgiri MP also claimed that increase in assets was linked to the government’s repeated announcements of reviewing G.O. 111., which links some villages in the catchment area of Gandipet lake. Did Mr. K.T. Rama Rao benefit promising reviewing the GO?, he asked.

299,2020/01/19,TRS has aligned itself with MIM: Laxman,"Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has been winning elections consistently for the last six years and it is high time for people to puncture the ‘car’ tyre as it failed to improve functioning of the municipal bodies, says State Bharatiya Janata Party president K. Laxman, in the run up to the Urban Local Body (ULB) polls.

Do you think ULB polls is a kind of referendum for the second term TRS government?

This is not a referendum, it is more about its abysmal performance in urban areas and for not fulfilling the promises made. It has deprived municipal bodies of adequate funds and has made State Finance Commission (SFC) ineffective. The government has to explain why urban areas are in such a bad shape - roads, drains and basic civic amenities.

Where do you think the TRS government stands in administration of urban regions?

Why should people vote for TRS in municipal elections? Close to 40% population live in urban areas but what have they done to improve the ULBs and living standards? How many two bedroom houses have they constructed after promising 500-1,000 in each. The educated unemployed have been ignored with recruitment mostly in police to protect themselves. Where are the skill development centres?

What do you think of K.T. Rama Rao’s work as Municipal Administration & Urban Development Minister?

He has has utterly failed in his job. Nothing moves in municipalities without paying a bribe whether it is a birth certificate or a death certificate. Online services at the citizen services centres are not working, and even in Hyderabad, it is taking six or more months to get building permissions. In his Sircilla, the municipal chairman was openly supporting corrupt practices. There is neither transparency nor accountability in understaffed ULBs.

Where do you think the government has specifically failed in urban regions?

They promised the moon stating that all the municipal areas will have underground drainage network and will be totally open defecation free but this has not happened. Street lights don’t work and the Centre’s grants for improving sanitation and buying new buses for the TSRTC has not been taken up. Regularisation of scores of employees working as contract staff in ULBs has not materialised.

Do you think the furore over Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will have an impact?

Local issues will gain prominence but CAA too will be part of the overall campaign. People are also closely watching the debate to understand which side each party is on the national security issues. Of course, the corruption free, welfare and development oriented record of Modi government will have some resonance.

Will you be able to repeat the Lok Sabha polls performance?

We created history in Parliament polls and won four seats contesting independently. That we are contesting 80% of seats on our own for the first time in municipal areas itself is a victory for us. We are pitted against money, muscle and liquor mafia of the ruling party, which has totally aligned with the MIM.

300,2020/01/19,Absolutely no chance for breach of voting secrecy: SEC,"The Telangana State Election Commission has asserted that there is absolutely no chance of breach of secrecy of voting of any voter and exhorted the electors to exercise their voting rights without any fear.

The SEC averred that any attempt to breach the secrecy of voting would be thwarted and severest punishment would be given to such perpetrators. The police authorities concerned had been directed to initiate prompt action in the event of any such case coming to their notice.

The commission said secrecy of voting is the fundamental feature of all elections and the SEC made fool proof arrangements to prevent any breach of secrecy either on the day of poll or on the day of counting.

Multi-layered security

The ballot boxes would be stored in strong rooms with multi-layered security with total transparency during the interregnum too and there is no chance of breaching this security.

Section 212 of the Telangana Municipalities Act 2019 makes it an offence to cause any break in the secrecy of voting and anybody attempting to break the law would be sent to jail for three months with a provision of imposition of fine too.

The Indian Penal Code Section 171C read with Section 171F imposes one-year jail term to anybody exerting or attempting to exert undue influence/interference with the free exercise of any electoral rights, the SEC added.

Meanwhile, the Commission had ordered the officials concerned to declare a local holiday on the polling day in the areas which were going to polls on January 22 and January 24.

302,2020/01/19,Prof. Kaseem sent to 14 days judicial remand,"Osmania University Associate Professor Chintakindi Kaseem was sent to 14 days’ judicial remand in the wee hours of Sunday. He was presented before First Class Magistrate Saritha by the Mulugu Police at about 3.30 a.m. and the judge ordered for his judicial remand. Later, Prof. Kaseem was shifted to Sangareddy District Jail located at Kandi mandal headquarters.

It may be recalled that a team of police officials had reached Prof. Kaseem’s house on the Osmania University campus at 7 a.m. on Saturday with a search warrant from the court. The search continued till 10 a.m. in the presence of the academic’s family members. Police seized a laptop, a personal computer, mobile phones, pen drives, some other electronic gadgets, and banned revolutionary literature. He was recently appointed as general secretary to the Viplava Rachayitala Sangham (VIRASAM) or Revolutionary Writers’ Association.

Police informed that Kaseem was in contact with CPI (Maoist) State Committee member Hari Bhushan, alias Jagan and other top leaders, and continued activities with the money supplied by them. He was also accused in six other cases.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/prof-kaseem-sent-to-14-days-judicial-remand/article30601180.ece
303,2020/01/19,"Release my son, he is innocent, Kaseem’s mother urges government","Veeramma, the mother of Chintakindi Kaseem, an associate professor with Osmania University, who was arrested by Siddipet police for suspected links with Maoists, said her son is innocent and was a good teacher.

“What mistake has my son committed? He fought for separate Statehood for Telangana. Was that a crime?” questioned Ms. Veeramma, while wiping tears as she continued to speak on the hardship brought on her son. Speaking to media persons here on Sunday, she said that her husband cannot live without seeing their son and demanded that the State government release him immediately. Further, Haragopal of Revolutionary Writers Association (Virasam) said that Kaseem endeared himself to the students and people of Telangana. “His speeches during the Telangana movement were so influential that lakhs of people used to wait for him at the public meetings for listening to him,” he said.

“Today morning when I asked a TRS party leader why the State government is arresting people, he told me that they want to create fear in the society to curb dissent,” Haragopal said.

Although there are no Maoist activities since the formation of separate State, the police are arresting revolutionary writers, human rights activities and several others by booking them under ‘wicked’ Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, only to deprive them of bail, he added. “More than 90 % of UAPA cases were acquitted by the various courts across the country,” he observed.

Further, he condemned the entry of people inside the prestigious education institution without seeking due permission from the Vice-Chancellor or the Registrar. “Police cannot enter the university premises without taking permission from the administration,” he said.

On Saturday, Mulugu police of Siddipet Commissionerate searched and arrested Kaseem from his house in the staff quarters on the Osmania University campus. Earlier, Virasam president Arsavelli Krishna said that Kaseem was arrested as he strongly opposed the undemocratic and autocratic rule of ruling TRS party.

Human Rights Forum (HRF) on Sunday condemned the arrest of Osmania University Associate Professor Chintakindi Kaseem.

In a statement, HRF coordination committee member Jeevan Kumar said that the police are creating fear in the society by arresting people like Kaseem and others.

“At a time when the State government and the police department claimed that there is no Maoist movements in the State, why they are arresting people,” he questioned.

He demanded the government to release Kaseem and others who were arrested for allegedly having links with Maoists.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/mthtzj/article30601167.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy19NSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/release-my-son-as-he-is-innocent-kaseems-mother-urges-govt/article30601168.ece

305,2020/01/19,Mahesh Babu’s Humbl Co. joins hands with Myntra,"Humbl Co, a menswear brand launched by actor Mahesh Babu six months ago, on Saturday announced its association with leading fashion portal Myntra.

Riding on the crest of success after his recent Telugu film, “Sari Leru Neekevvaru”, the actor came personally to announce the association, to take his apparel brand all across the country and enhance its reach, especially in Tier II and Tier III cities, where Myntra has a strong presence.

Talking about Humbl Co brand sweatshirts, hoodies, shirts, T-shirts and bottom wear, which will be now be available on Myntra, Mr. Mahesh Babu said it conveys the philosophy of “stay humble, real and simple”. “The values of simplicity and humility that I believe in form the core of the brand’s mission statement,” he said.

He said that the journey so far after launching the brand for which he gives credit to his wife Namrata has been memorable and he was now excited with the brand’s association with Myntra as it gives access to pan India audience.

Accepting compliments for the success of his latest film, Mr Mahesh sporting a simple blue shirt, his favourite colour incidentally said association with Myntra just happened and they were not looking at any other online brand for now.

He also said he was not thinking of any other commercial venture and “right now Humbl co is special for us’.

Though his brand is associated with Myntra to facilitate online shopping, Mahesh Babu admitted he did not shop personally as all his shopping was done for him by his wife. “ I am married to Namratha for 15 years now and dated her for five years before that. Thus for the last 20 years I have not been shopping for my clothes,” he said answering a query with a smile.

But would he shop for his children? “ you know how this generation is. They can get what they want. Yes sometimes when we we go abroad I do shop” he said.

Asked about what role he enjoyed most, being an entrepreneur or an actor, he said, “acting is my life and I enjoy it the most. My wife takes care of entrepreneurship”.

Asked about his favourite design and colour he said checks shirt and blue colour.” I am some one who can attend an award function with a checks shirt,”.

On his next film, he said he was now on a two-month break and after three months, new movie would be announced.

Mr. Amar Nagaram, Head Myntra Jabong said associating with Mahesh Babu’s brand Humbl Co was the perfect match for them as men’s wear was growing at 100 per cent year on year. Men’s casual and Western wear was attracting lot of traction.The kind of fandom Mahesh enjoyed, fans would be delighted to see his brands available online and clothes reflecting his style.

He said Myntra has 3,000 brands and the portal was launching a brand first time from the Souther part of the country.

306,2020/01/19,15% properties in city may be un-assessed or under-assessed,"Satellite survey of city’s properties has the potential to bring a windfall to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), if carried out to the end, and tax levied thereof on un-assessed properties.

As can be gauged from the trend so far, nearly 15 per cent of the total properties in the city could have been un-assessed or under-assessed in terms of property tax calculation.

GHMC had taken up satellite imaging and survey of properties in the city to bring all un-assessed and under-assessed structures into tax purview by the end of 2019.

Successfully carried out in Moosapet circle, the project entails capturing satellite images of properties and identifying the un-assessed and under-assessed ones among them, through physical verification. All the properties will be geo-tagged after inspection.

The project, however, has been delayed due to various technical and logistical snags, and the corporation could complete only a minuscule portion by the year-end.

For the survey, the city has been divided into several dockets, the number of which has been finally fixed at 350. Of these, survey has been taken up in 107 dockets in the first phase, covering more than 5.4 lakh properties.

As things stand now, satellite imaging has been completed for all these properties, and field verification is going on. So far, more than 45,000 properties have been inspected physically and geo-tagged, officials informed. Of these, over 6,600 properties were found to have been either un-assessed or under-assessed, which constitute almost 15 per cent of the total.

The maximum number of un-assessed properties have been found in the Kukatpally zone, while Khairatabad zone is home to most of the under- assessed structures, officials informed.

If the ratio is replicated across the city, the corporation could become a lot richer simply by re-assessing the structures for property tax. As per the data from the Town Planning wing, the city has close to 15 lakh properties, which have been constructed following all legal parameters.

Of these, 12 lakh properties are listed as residential, about 2.5 lakh are non-residential, and 40,000 are mixed. The revenue through property tax from them for the year 2018-19 amounted to ₹1,400 crore.

The pilot project done in Moosapet had yielded the corporation an additional revenue of ₹21 crore.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bb88vy/article30596691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-PROPERTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/15-properties-in-city-may-be-un-assessed-or-under-assessed/article30596690.ece
307,2020/01/19,A tough road ahead for pedestrians,"City roads are set to pose tougher challenges to pedestrians, if decisions taken at the City Convergence meeting on Saturday are to be implemented on ground.

One among the decisions was to remove gaps in the central medians on the Metro Rail corridors. Though the medians were built without gaps initially, they were later broken at some places to allow drainage of excess water during monsoon. The gaps, wherever they exist, are serving as unauthorised pedestrian crossings, to remove which a decision was taken in Saturday’s meeting.

Instead, walkers will be directed through signage towards foot over bridges (FOBs), a statement from GHMC informed. In areas where vehicle traffic is very high, railings will be erected on central medians to prevent pedestrian crossing.

The meeting under the chairmanship of GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar also took a decision to conduct a study towards re-engineering of the roads in 52 identified black spots where accidents recur despite various safety measures. Road engineering, Traffic and Transport officials will take up the joint study, it informed.

Service road will be developed on the 11-km stretch between Mehdipatnam and Gachibowli, and footpaths too will be modernised on this stretch. Traffic issues will be addressed also on the road between Dilsukhnagar and L.B. Nagar, where the stretch is narrow, the statement said.

The Commissioner has directed the Hyderabad Metro Rail authorities to shift the bus shelters built by them to alternative locations suggested by traffic police, in view of several of them being closer to junctions, resulting in traffic jams. It has also been decided to provide signage about speed limits on major city roads to prevent accidents.

The meeting, conducted at the Police Commissionerate, also discussed women’s safety issues in the city. Crimes such as chain snatching and harassment may be curbed by increasing lighting on roads and colonies where several educational institutes, coaching centres and companies exist, the meeting decided.

Directions have been given to the HMWS&SB officials to plug leakages on war footing in areas such as Chandrayangutta, Banjara Hills, Malkajgiri, and others.

309,2020/01/19,The Mind Matters: How Tamil Nadu is coping with high prevalence of mental illnesses,"It is more than two years since Akila*, in her early 50s, had a visitor from home. She remembers being unwell and uncared for, going without food, sleep and a bath for days, and developing a fear of water. As her symptoms worsened, her son left her at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in Chennai where she was diagnosed with Bipolar Affective Disorder. He has not returned since, and her daughter, whom she remembers seeing two years ago, expressed her inability to take her back home. The campus is her home now, and Akila, who has improved with treatment, is no longer keen on going back either

Almost a decade ago, the death of her husband sent Bairavi*, now aged 38, into depression. Upset and sleepless is how she could explain her state then. But she knew she needed help. Diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, she spent the next few years in treatment and rehabilitation at The Banyan. After spending nearly five years away from her daughter, Bairavi is back home, managing the NGO’s office in a district in Tamil Nadu, enthusiastically reaching out to people like her.

Jency* was in her early twenties when her mother was diagnosed with mental illness. Her mother’s death by suicide left a permanent scar. Years later, Jency found herself in the midst of a sea of emotions precipitated by the death of her husband’s friend. She feared losing her husband. That marked the beginning of her long struggle with bipolar disorder. A six-month-long stint in a health care institution enabled her to put the pieces of her life back together. Tackling relapses, she knew advocacy was her strength and embarked on a new journey

Mental illness changed the lives of these three women. Like hundreds of people in the same situation, Akila, Bairavi and Jency are still not understood by the vast majority. The reasons: lack of awareness and stigma attached to mental disorders.

The problem partly lies in differentiating mental health from physical health. From there on, it takes a different path; a path in which availability and access to mental health services, adequate mental health professionals, affordable treatment leading to rehabilitation and integration into society become issues.

Disease burden

The recently-published ‘The burden of mental disorders across the States of India: the Global Burden of Disease Study 1990-2017’ (Lancet Psychiatry, 2019) says mental disorders are among the leading causes of the non-fatal disease burden in India. Giving the prevalence and disease burden of each mental disorder for the States, it finds that the proportional contribution of mental disorders to the total disease burden in India has almost doubled since 1990.

The prevalence of mental disorders that predominantly manifest during adulthood – depressive and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder – was generally higher in the more developed southern States than in the less developed northern States, it says.

Tamil Nadu, being one of the States in the high socio-demographic index group, accounted for a high prevalence of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and schizophrenia.

The crude Disability Adjusted Life Years (a summary measure of total health loss) rate of depressive disorders was highest in T.N. in this group.

Commenting on the study, R. Thara, vice-chairperson of Schizophrenia Research Foundation, says that there has been no country-wide look at the burden of mental disorders so far.

“The Global Burden of Disease study is not prevalence or an epidemiological study. The data was collated from experts. Nevertheless, it gives us an overview of the prevalence of mental disorders,” she says.

With better literacy rates and mental healthcare services, southern States such as T.N. and Kerala have accounted for higher rates of depressive and anxiety disorders and schizophrenia.

“We need to see if this is due to better reporting or a true reflection of prevalence rates. How are we going to handle this? We need to think about increasing awareness on mental health, early diagnosis and treatment, and reduction of stigma,” she adds.

Modernisation and urbanisation are among the likely causes for this high prevalence. Vandana Gopikumar, co-founder, The Banyan, feels that urbanisation has resulted in migration, cultural disaffiliation, identity crisis and certainly overcrowding, all of which may have an impact on mental health. “Nuclearisation of families has many gains, but it has also resulted in decreased support networks,” she adds.

C. Ramasubramanian, former State Nodal Officer for Mental Health Programme, attributes the rise in the numbers of depressive and anxiety disorder to the isolation caused by urbanisation. Even in tier-2 cities such as Madurai, joint families have disintegrated to form nuclear families which make individuals ‘islands’, he says.

Access to services

Dr. Thara says: “Our research has shown that in rural areas, 80-85% persons do not access mental health services and remain untreated for 10-12 years. Despite a fairly good District Mental Health Programme in the State, the distance to the nearest medical facility is still huge.

When treatments are not accessible, disease burden increases, observes Anna Tharyan, retired professor of psychiatry, Christian Medical College, Vellore. “Psychological treatment is even less accessible than medical treatment, especially to low and middle socio-economic populations in rural areas. Non-availability of psychiatric treatment at primary and secondary level government hospitals means that the financially deprived cannot access care.”

It is here that primary health care should play a larger role.

“Today, we have technology to address most of the problems of mental health at the primary and secondary care level but its implementation is ineffective. The emphasis is on starting invention as early as possible. The primary health care system, which comprises the first contact care, should identify persons with mental illness and bring them to care,” says K.V. Kishore Kumar, director, The Banyan.

Less-recognised areas

Certain areas continue to be less recognised — post-partum depression, substance/alcohol abuse and domestic violence.

The study observed sex differentials in the distribution of mental disorders; higher prevalence of both depressive and anxiety disorders in women than in men could be related to gender discrimination, violence, sexual abuse, antenatal and postnatal stress and adverse socio-cultural norms.

Mental health is not without newer challenges, especially involving the young. The rapidity of social changes is a huge factor. Social networking, gadget addiction and having virtual friends than real friends, experts add.

Sapna Bangar, psychiatrist and head, Mpower-The Centre, Mumbai, says children are not taught to take ‘no’ for an answer and are given more privileges; as a result, they, as a generation, have poor resilience and poor coping strategies.

Are there strong links between mental disorders and suicides? Lakshmi Vijayakumar, psychiatrist and founder of SNEHA, says depression is an important factor associated with suicide but not the only factor. One-third of persons who die by suicide are addicted to alcohol or are under the influence of alcohol. “Here, we need to look at triad of depression-alcoholism-suicide,” she says.

Where T.N. stands

For a State that leads in a number of health indicators, T.N. has come a long way in establishing mental health services, but more needs to be done, say experts.

P. Poorna Chandrika, director of Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Chennai, says, “When compared to other States, Tamil Nadu is way ahead in providing mental health services.”

Under the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP), which was launched in 1997 and expanded to 32 districts over the years, every district has two psychiatrists, a clinical psychologist, psychiatric nurse and social worker, and 10 beds allotted for psychiatric patients in district hospitals.

IMH, one of the largest treatment facilities in T.N., is currently home to around 900 patients. A document of the Department of Health and Family Welfare shows that IMH catered to an average of 341 out-patients per day during 2017-2018 and 352 during 2018-2019. Its in-patient figures were 861 per day during 2017-2018 and 833 during 2018-2019. But it is the average length of stay of each patient that makes IMH different from other institutions – 97 days in 2017-2018 and 102 in 2018-2019.

‘Mindset must change’

“The mindset of people should change. Institutions such as IMH are hospitals and not asylums. Integrating persons, who improve with treatment, back in society is crucial, and we are taking steps towards it by providing training, and creating job opportunities for many of them,” Dr. Chandrika adds.

Implementation of DMHP varies from place to place.

A 10-bedded psychiatric ward at Usilampatti’s Government Hospital is occupied by patients with reported fever cases. “It is common for us to utilise the psychiatric ward because there are only a few people who ever get admitted. Some visit the doctor at the out-patient wing if there is a necessity but it is not used much,” says a nurse.

Usilampatti Government Hospital is a telling sign of the ground-level execution of the mental health programme in Madurai. Although several institutional arrangements are made for the effective implementation of the mental health programme here, the work on the ground does not measure up.

There are districts that are trend-setters. Take Pudukottai for instance. Its DMHP programme officer, R. Karthik Deivanayagam, says a special helpline for people to contact in case of emergencies was launched, and it receives at least five such calls a day. Among other initiatives, Mental Health Clubs at various government schools and colleges, and village mental health committees at the panchayat level are being formed.

He says that interdepartmental dependence is required across all medical domains, not just in mental health.

""If a patient has a cardiac problem, is he/she not referred to the cardiologist? Similarly, a psychiatric referral must also be resorted to,"" he says. The biomedical approach to medicine, wherein medicines are prescribed for all illnesses, must be discouraged, he adds.

At the school level, the city corporation and M. S. Chellamuthu Trust have begun ‘Happy Schooling’ at 24 schools in Madurai city. The programme is aimed at promoting emotional well-being among the students.

Revathi Mohan, a psychologist from Thiruchengode, says that though counsellors are appointed in many schools, they are not utilised well.

Need of the moment

Long-term care is one of the many challenges. Ms. Gopikumar, points out, “In keeping with the Mental Healthcare Act, Mental Health Policy and Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, it is essential that inclusive living options be provided for such persons when they seek it.”

Dr. Bangar says the immediate need is to improve the healthcare budget as the government spends less than one per cent on mental healthcare, when the need is four to five per cent.

There is a need for more number of mental health professionals.

Social workers dedicated to mental health at the block primary health centres and creating posts of deputy director for mental health at the district-level are important, say officials. A senior psychiatrist says a line listing of all cases is essential.

“Attitudes change by contact and experience. Therefore, we need to have more people with mental health issues in the workforce and greater diversity in communities. Challenging prejudice and stigma requires determination, persistence and radical empathy. That alone will ensure lasting change and better help-seeking patterns,” Ms. Gopikumar sums up.

310,2020/01/19,What is the source of the new SARS-like disease reported in China?,"The story so far: On December 31, 2019, China informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of an unknown cause in Wuhan City in Hubei province. A few patients in Wuhan had been suffering from respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia since early December. Besides providing care, Chinese public health officials began carrying out environmental assessments at the wholesale market and trying to identify the microbe causing the outbreak.

How was the virus identified as a coronavirus?

On January 9, 2020, WHO issued a statement saying Chinese researchers have made “preliminary determination” of the virus as a novel coronavirus in a person with pneumonia. They were able to determine the virus by sequencing the genome using an isolate taken from an infected patient. WHO tweeted: “Preliminary identification of a novel virus in a short period of time is a notable achievement and demonstrates China’s increased capacity to manage new outbreaks.”

Public health experts are yet to identify the source of the new virus.

What are coronaviruses?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less severe common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). While the SARS coronavirus is thought to be an animal virus from an as-yet-uncertain animal reservoir, perhaps bats, that spread to other animals (civet cats) and first infected humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002, the MERS coronavirus was passed on from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012.

Has China shared the genome sequence data?

On January 11, China shared the whole genome sequence data with WHO and submitted them to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) platform to allow researchers across the world to access the data. Sharing the data with GISAID will help other countries to quickly identify the virus, provide care, and also develop specific diagnostic kits, drugs and even vaccines. Since January 11, five more genome sequences have been submitted to GISAID.

How many have been infected?

Using the genomic test kit, China was able to accurately identify that only 41 of the 59 suspected cases have been infected. On January 17, four more cases were reported by the Wuhan health department. According to WHO, the clinical signs and symptoms of the patients are mainly fever and fatigue, accompanied by dry cough, with a few experiencing difficulty in breathing. Chest radiographs showed fluid in both lungs.

As of January 17, two people had died.

Has the virus been able to spread among humans?

WHO has said 763 people, including medical staff, who have come in close contact with patients infected with the novel coronavirus, have been identified for close monitoring. Based on preliminary epidemiological investigation, most of the patients had come in close contact with animals or frequently visited a wholesale seafood market (which authorities in Wuhan said was the centre of the outbreak, and closed since January 1).

But in the case of the Japanese man who had travelled to Wuhan and found to be infected with the new virus, the transmission does not seem to be from animals as the person did not visit the Huanan seafood market.

According to WHO, the fact that certain cases do not seem linked with the seafood market would mean that the possibility of “limited human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded”.

Has the virus been seen in people outside China?

On January 8, a 61-year-old woman who had travelled from Wuhan to Thailand was hospitalised and mild pneumonia was diagnosed. Thermal surveillance at the one of the airports in Bangkok detected the febrile illness of the traveller. Subsequent testing confirmed that the woman, a Chinese national, was that country’s first imported case of a ‘novel’ coronavirus infection. She had not visited the Wuhan seafood market but instead another market where freshly slaughtered animals are sold. A second case was seen in Thailand on Friday, January 17 in a 74-year-old Chinese woman who travelled from Wuhan. On January 16, Japan reported a case of a man in his 30s who was infected with the new coronavirus. He has been discharged from hospital.

Are there any travel restrictions to China?

India has issued a travel advisory asking citizens to follow certain precautionary measures while visiting China. “WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available”. It does not recommend that travellers take any specific measures either. However, WHO provides general tips to reduce the risk of infection such as washing hands with soap and water, covering one’s nose and mouth while sneezing and coughing, avoiding contact with anyone who has cold or flu-like symptoms, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoid making unprotected contact with wild or farm animals.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/dagus6/article30595785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THiStock-939349794,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-alert/article30595786.ece

312,2020/01/19,CAA violates basic principles of India’s founding: Bhushan,"The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is discriminatory and arbitrary and violates the fundamental principles of India’s founding, said senior advocate Prashant Bhushan.

Speaking to The Hindu here on Saturday, he said the Act discriminated on the basis of religion and so violated the principles that have been fundamental to the understanding of India. He was in the city to speak at a convention organised against the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and CAA.

Mr. Bhushan said the recent invocation of the UAPA in a case implicating young people in Kerala showed how draconian the law was. The Act gives arbitrary power to the police to designate anyone or any organisation as terrorist. Addressing the convention, he said the burden of proof now rested with the person or persons accused of any act that appeared to be disruptive. As a result, thousands of people languish in Indian jails under wrongful detention because they have to prove their innocence.

The Act provides arbitrary powers to the State. The National Security Act too fell in the same category as was shown in the case of Chandrashekhar Azad, who underwent long detention, he added.

The CAA is also arbitrary in its choice of countries for India to provide citizenship. It leaves out countries like Sri Lanka and Nepal while choosing Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. The basis for providing refuge and citizenship is also religious persecution and not any other reason, Mr. Bhushan observed.

The convention was organised by People United against UAPA. Abha Muraleedharan, former judge of the Kerala High Court P.K. Shamsudheen, John Joseph, K.P. Sethunath, and Smriti Shashidharan spoke.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/rebzgo/article30597300.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-KI-UAPA-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/caa-violates-basic-principles-of-indias-founding-bhushan/article30597301.ece
313,2020/01/19,One more arrested in gold heist case,"The Crime Branch (CB) made a third arrest in quick succession in connection with the heist of around 20 kg of gold valued at ₹6 crore from Binanipuram in May last year.

The arrested is Jamal, 40, of Thodupuzha. He was charged with disposing of the stolen gold. Jamal is the third person to be arrested by the investigation agency in the last four days on similar charges.

The alleged robbery took place on the night of May 9 last year when the car transporting 20 kg of gold to be refined and enhanced in purity came under attack from two motorcycle-borne assailants after it halted for the security guard near the gate at CGR Metalloys Private Limited at Binanipuram.

According to CB sources, Jamal was an accomplice of Ajmal, 36, of Madakkathanam near Muvattupuzha, one of the two who were arrested on the charge of disposing of over 2 kg of the stolen gold to jewellery outlets near Kottayam.

314,2020/01/19,"Sprinklers used at Maradu ineffective, says NGT panel","The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Maradu Municipality to ensure adequate use of sprinklers and fencing around the nearly 76,000 tonnes of debris that emerged following the demolition of the four apartment buildings.

SLMC Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, who visited the sites on Saturday, observed that the sprinklers provided for dust management were not effective. Sound and dust control measures have to be strengthened by providing revolving type jet sprinklers to get a rainy effect, he said.

Mr. Pillai suggested provision of additional barriers with metal sheets and specific dust control facilities like double-layered garden at the sites. There should also be periodic wetting of roads and CCTV surveillance of the sites, he said.

The Maradu Municipality will be responsible for debris removal as per the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules - 2016 and the Supreme Court directive.

The civic authorities have been told to report the plans for removal of debris, the site to which it will be transferred, and details of units engaged for reprocessing debris.

They have to report the steps taken till now and come up with a plan to complete the removal of debris within the time frame specified by the apex court.

The municipal authorities have been asked to appear before the SLMC in Thiruvananthapuram on January 24. The committee will also ask Snehil Kumar Singh, Revenue Divisional Officer, Fort Kochi, who was in charge of the demolition, to appear before it on January 24.

Officials of the Pollution Control Board (PCB), who accompanied the SLMC Chairman, pointed out that they had issued a letter to the municipality immediately after the demolition, asking it to ensure proper use of sprinklers to contain dust.

M.A. Baiju, Chief Environmental Engineer, PCB, Ernakulam, said the contractors engaged for removing debris had submitted an application, seeking the board’s authorisation for storage and processing of debris for manufacture of products like sand and construction materials.

A hearing is being planned in which they will explain the plan of action, he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/tozoz0/article30597239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-KI-MARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/sprinklers-used-at-maradu-ineffective-says-ngt-panel/article30597240.ece
315,2020/01/19,Connectivity issues ailing boat service,"The sole service between Vyttila and Kakkanad continues to bleed the State Water Transport Department (SWTD) financially as the expenses far outweigh the revenue generated thanks to poor patronage.

Though the service remains suspended for a week now owing to the annual maintenance work on the boat, the fact that none has really missed it tells a tale. The service is set to resume on Monday.

The service was launched between Vyttila and Chittethukara with much fanfare in 2014 and was even popular for a brief while, especially with the Infopark-based techies thanks mainly to the free feeder service operated by Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL). However, it changed the moment KMRL withdrew the feeder service owing to audit objections, and things have steadily gone downhill since then.

Hardly a fraction of the boat with capacity to carry up to 100 passengers gets filled up during most of its 16 services a day except for the average occupancy during peak hours. The service needs around 100 litres of diesel, besides the daily wages of five workers.

“While the daily collections hover in the region of ₹2,500 to ₹3,000, the expenses almost breach ₹10,000. However, we are not driven by profit motive and hence continue to operate it as a service,” said M. Sujith, traffic superintendent, SWTD, Ernakulam region.

Poor connectivity

The absence of connectivity from Chittethukara to Kakkanad and Infopark remains the single biggest bane of the service, driving away potential passengers, including those from the Vyttila Mobility Hub who otherwise would have preferred it to the heavily congested roads.

“We have for long been demanding the extension of the service to Infopark. Till then, a feeder service can be deployed from Chittethukara, and techies will be more than willing to pay for it,” said Aneesh Panthalani, president, Progressive Techies, a combine of IT employees.

Meanwhile, KMRL is planning to connect the Vyttila-Kakkanad stretch under its ambitious Water Metro project. “The route will be served in the first phase of the project, and work on the boat jetty has already started. The plan is to kick-start the project towards the end of this year,” said KMRL sources.

Notwithstanding Water Metro services, the SWTD may have to continue with its service at a much affordable rate.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/connectivity-issues-ailing-boat-service/article30597210.ece
316,2020/01/19,SWTD clears chaos at boat jetties,"After the initial chaos following the withdrawal of gate checkers at boat jetties in the district, the State Water Transport Department (SWTD) has managed to restore normalcy by deploying security watchers and spare staff.

Four security watchers deployed outside the district were deployed as gate checkers on Friday with two more joining the ranks on Saturday. Besides, the services of spare staff put on standby at jetties during duty time to replace employees on duty, if need be, was also availed of.

“Another 25 security watchers are to be recruited through the employment exchange on a six-month contract on January 25. A pool of 10 security checkers will be enough as gate checkers, and the remaining four needed to plug the gap could be deployed from this lot,” said M. Sujith, traffic superintendent, SWTD, Ernakulam region.

Though the SWTD operates boat services from 5 a.m. to 9.30 p.m, gate checkers are needed in full strength mostly during morning and evening peak hours between 8.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. and 4 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. This is likely to be addressed by the soon-to-be-recruited contract watchers who could be deployed on a 12-hour shift between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.

The SWTD had to withdraw the services of gate checkers deployed from its own crew strength allotted in accordance with the number of boats, following audit objection over the arrangement, resulting in engagement of daily wage workers for boat operations to make up for manpower shortage.

As many as 15 employees split into three teams of five members — a boat master, skip, driver, and two helpers — have been allotted for seamless operation of boat services on shift basis while also covering employees’ weekly off. Out of these, seven employees were deployed as gate checkers adjoining five ticket counters at Ernakulam, Willingdon Island, Fort Kochi, and Vypeen.

“We broached the subject with service organisations thoroughly foreseeing chaos over withdrawal of gate checkers. Though the idea of deploying checking staff at gates were fleetingly explored, it had to be dropped as organisations resisted it, maintaining that they could be posted aboard boats alone,” said Mr. Sujith.

Passengers after purchasing tickets had to queue up before gate checkers before proceeding in an orderly manner to board boats.

Things went smooth initially after gate checkers were withdrawn last week as passengers were unaware of the development and boarded boats in a disciplined manner. However, chaos set in after they realised that there were no gate checkers any longer, and passengers, even those without tickets, boarded boats unchecked. This led to overload and delayed services, sparking off heated exchanges between passengers and boat crew.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/n7mquv/article30597197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-KI-SWTD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/swtd-clears-chaos-at-boat-jetties/article30597198.ece
317,2020/01/19,Ernakulam staring at a water crisis,"Shortage of water at the Bhoothathankettu barrage has affected water supply in areas of Ernakulam fed by the Periyar Valley irrigation scheme and led to rise in salinity in the Kadambrayar river, according to Irrigation Department officials.

Tailrace discharge from the Idamalayar hydroelectric project mainly feeds the Periyar Valley canals that run a length of 750 km across Kothamangalam, Muvattupuzha, Aluva, Paravur, Kunnathunad and Kanayannur taluks. The canals mostly meet irrigation purposes in these areas when the barrage is opened in early January every year.

“A minimum level of 34.95 metres must be maintained at the Bhoothathankettu barrage to ensure distribution of water through the canals under the Periyar Valley project. Only if the level is maintained can the various sluices and channels, particularly those at an elevation, be filled,” said an official associated with the project. “But power generation at the Idamalayar power house has reduced, particularly since last week after the hartal, leading to a drastic fall in the level of water at the barrage to around 32.85 metres.”

Repeated requests to the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) to increase power generation did not yield results till two days ago, when the level rose by around 40 metres. “The KSEB is required to ensure that the Irrigation Department’s need of 4 million metre cube per day for the Periyar Valley canals is met, but they have cited repairs of a generator as the reason for shortage,” another Irrigation Department official said.

However, a KSEB engineer in charge of the Idamalayar dam maintained that electricity production levels had not dipped recently, and that they had experienced no shortage of water.

Several rural water supply schemes under the Perumbavoor section, in which pump houses draw from the Periyar Valley canals, have been affected for the past few weeks, said a Kerala Water Authority (KWA) official.

Water to Kochi could be indirectly affected by this shortage. Since the canals flow into the Kadambrayar and the Periyar, the shortage of water could lead to a reverse flow of saline water and a consequent increase in salinity in the two rivers. The recent water shortage at Infopark which relies partly on the Kadambrayar that has seen an inflow of saline water in the past few weeks, could be attributed to this, the Irrigation Department official said.

“The shortage we experience in the later summer months has set in now. Since the water table dipped after the floods, the demand has gone up, and cultivators are dependent on the Periyar Valley project for water supply,” the official added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/57j1oe/article30597177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19-KI-EDAMALAYAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ernakulam-staring-at-a-water-crisis/article30597178.ece

319,2020/01/19,‘Krishna Menon drafted Constitution’s preamble’,"Every student today is reading the preamble of the Indian Constitution in the protests [against the Citizenship Amendment Act]. “Guess who wrote it? Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon,” claimed senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh at the Kerala Literature Festival on Sunday.

Mr. Ramesh was attending a discussion on his biography of the late former Defence Minister, along with Shashi Tharoor, MP, and Janaki Ram, Menon’s grand-niece.

“From 1933, he was bombarding Jawaharlal Nehru with ideas on a Constituent Assembly. Gandhi was not enamoured. Only Nehru agreed,” Mr. Ramesh said. Finally Gandhi changed his mind and it became a reality in 1946. “It was he who drafted the preamble and added the words independent, sovereign, republic into it,” Mr. Ramesh said.

The Congress leader pointed out that Menon was the spokesman for Indian independence in Britain. “...All Indian history textbooks teach us that the Indian freedom movement was essentially a freedom movement fought in India. That is true. But there is another strand of freedom movement, which was negotiations between the Indian National Congress and the Labour Party that lasted for 12 years,” Mr. Ramesh said. In those negotiations, Menon was a pivotal figure because of his relationship with economist Harold Lasky, and British politicians Stafford Cripps and Clement Attlee. “The fact that Indian independence came on the agenda of the Labour Party in the later ’30s and continued thereafter was entirely Menon’s contribution,” he said.

Though Menon was portrayed as a villain after India’s war with China in 1962, he had always argued that the border dispute should be solved only through dialogue. However, his views were not listened to at that time, Mr. Ramesh added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/krishna-menon-drafted-constitutions-preamble/article30601379.ece

321,2020/01/19,Violence in local body polls deplored,"Tamil Nadu Government Employees’ Association has proposed to conduct a series of protests against the police inaction against those who unleashed violence during the January 11 indirect election for the posts of Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson in four panchayat unions in Virudhunagar district.

A resolution to this effect was passed at the district office-bearers meeting held here on Saturday.

Its president K. Liyakat Ali said the district administration swung into action to hold the election in a short duration of time. “There was absolutely no violence in the direct election where lakhs of people came out to vote. However, during the indirect election wherein only a handful of elected representatives needed to cast their votes, there was so much violence in four out of 11 panchayat unions,” he said.

Violent incidents were reported at Narikudi, Rajapalayam, Watrap and Sattur unions.

“It was the ruling party cadre who unleashed violence in all four places. Ballot papers were torn, ballot box was broken, a Deputy Superintendent of Police was assaulted with machete and election officials had to be protected by the police by locking them inside rooms,” the resolution said.

It was the worst violence the district has ever faced in the five rural body elections held so far, he said.

Condemning that the cadre had targeted Returning Officers, he said officials and employees, especially women were under fear to conduct re-poll.

“Except for the violent incident that led to assault of police officer at Narikudi, perpetrators of crime in other three unions are yet to be arrested,” the resolution said.

The association sought booking of AIADMK councillors who instigated violence.

“In the fight among political parties, a junior assistant and two office assistants were transferred from Sivakasi union. Government employees can work only as per the established rules and punishing them for doing their duty is undemocratic,” the president said.

In an election-related rivalry, K. Balraj (52), who lost the rural local body election to the post of president of Uthapuram panchayat near Usilampatti, allegedly assaulted to death another candidate, N. Muthiah (50), on Saturday.

Police said that both Muthiah and Balraj belonged to an upper caste, and Muthiah was the community leader. After both of them had filed their nominations, Balraj convinced Muthiah that two candidates contesting from the same community would split the community votes and wanted him to withdraw his candidature in favour of Balraj.

The police said that Muthiah claimed that he had already spent money for the election and promised to withdraw if he was compensated for the election expenses. Balraj gave him ₹15,000.

However, Muthiah later claimed that he could not withdraw his nomination as the last date for withdrawal was already over. But he campaigned for Balraj and sought votes for him. When the election results were announced, Balraj lost the poll to one Murugan of Melapatti.

On Saturday afternoon, Balraj, along with some of his supporters, went to the house of Muthiah and picked a quarrel with him, accusing Muthiah of not having kept his promise of garnering votes for him.

They insisted that Muthiah should return the money. As the quarrel turned into a scuffle, Muthiah fell unconscious and he was rushed to Elumalai Primary Health Centre, where he was declared dead.

As usual, thousands of migratory birds have arrived at irrigation tanks in the Tamirabharani basin and thousands of local birds started breeding in their regular nests.

As most of the rain-fed and system tanks in these districts are brimming with water, the number of birds camping in these water bodies has increased substantially.

ATREE’s Agasthyamalai Community Conservation Centre, St., John’s College, Palayamkottai, Pearl City Nature Society, Thoothukudi, and Nellai Nature Club, Tirunelveli, are organising the count this year in coordination with Tamil Nadu Forest Department, Tirunelveli division.

Flow of water from forests in the Western Ghats into streams and rivers feeds a large network of tanks in these districts and supports over 100 species of waterbirds and many of them are migratory species.

Irrigation tanks are full of water this year due to good rain and some tanks are very clean and hold more water this time than last year thanks to the efforts of voluntary organisations and district administration in desilting and proper maintenance.

Important water bodies such as Koonthankulam, Thirupudaimaruthur, Vijayanarayanam and Gangaikondan in Tirunelveli district, Vagaikulam in Tenkasi district and Kadambakulam, Perunkulam, Arumugamangalam, Vellur and Melputhukudi Sunai in Thoothukudi districts attract a large number of waterbirds during the winter season. These birds play a very important role in the ecosystem and local people have strong cultural links with these birds.

“But there are encroachments, pollution and urbanization and there is no concern for biodiversity. With increasing demand for water for development and human consumption, these wetlands are in great danger. The people around these wetlands should be aware of value of the natural resources and protect them against damage for the benefit of people and biodiversity. The waterbird count is an effort to bring attention of local citizens to these wetlands,” said M. Mathivanan, coordinator, TWC.

Padma, said that although the team has been performing intense diagnosis of foetus with detailed scans in the past, there were several complications which may arise, including the improper formation of organs, problems relating to the presence of amniotic fluid and issues like Down Syndrome.

“Advanced technology has helped us treat major issues and selectively terminate pregnancies of foetuses which may go on to have a complicated life ahead,” she said.

She added that experimental surgeries inside the uterus are being performed outside the country and will soon arrive to India. The fetal medicine department, she said, would be prepared to deal with all stages of pregnancies.

T. Mukuntharajan, Interventional Radiologist, said that if more people end up consulting doctors in early stages of pregnancies, complications for the parent and child can be averted. He said that MMHRC had the equipment and infrastructure to handle complex cases.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/fetal-medicine-department-inaugurated/article30600660.ece
329,2020/01/19,Pollution caused by ongoing development works results in health hazards,"MADURAI

Construction of new bridges in the city is welcome, but at the same time as pollution caused by the ongoing development works has resulted in health hazards to road users, according to doctors at Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH).

The debris on New Natham Road up to Oomachikulam police station is posing a major health hazard. Kalavasal junction is another major point, where bridge work has resulted in chaos among vehicle users and is causing irritation to shopkeepers due to accumulated debris and other heavy metals.

At the time of commencement of the mega work on New Natham Road, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials promised to keep the stretch motorable and the contractor firm assured to sprinkle water now and then. They also gave an assurance to repair and black-top the surface where potholes had developed. However, in reality, the promises appear to have gone with the wind, road users fume.

The State government had announced construction of two bridges – one spanning about eight km at ₹ 700 crore along New Natham Road and another at Kalavasal intersection at ₹ 40 crore – and the quantum of dust crossed the permissible levels that many vehicle users have complained of respiratory problems.

According to the GRH doctors, dust and fumes from building materials, which were lying at the sites here, would affect lungs. “It is more than smoking a cigarette,” pulmonologist M. Palaniappan said, adding the atmospheric air pollution might be well above the 100 ppm in these pockets, while 50 ppm or below is considered to be quality air worth inhaling.

According to former Vice-Chancellor of Periyar University and MKU Professor K. Muthuchezhiyan, the impact of particulate or dust pollution in the city may lead to non-fatal heart attack, irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased lung function and increased respiratory symptoms.

Dust pollution is most visible in Kalavasal, Periyar bus stand, Goripalayam and Palanganatham, according to a study conducted as a part of research activities. They are vulnerable and prone to particulate pollution.

It contained solid particles and the dust from a construction material from unpaved roads or bridges caused irritation to lungs. The wind turbulence in these areas, mainly released from metal-containing particles, was from frictional forces such as wear of tyres and application of brakes.

Prof. Muthuchelian said that scientific analysis revealed that pollution levels were as high as 100 microns particulate nature in cubic metre released in Goripalayam. These, he added, were due to release of silica, nitrate, sulphate and other heavy metals.

By planting saplings in these stretches, the pollution level could be reduced, Dr. Palaniappan said, and a senior physician at the GRH said special masks used by doctors handling critical patients alone had the capability to protect the nasal ways. Wearing full-mask helmets might help to an extent in protecting the hair from the dust and dirt, but inhaling the atmospheric air would cause throat irritation, he noted.

The residential welfare associations along New Natham Road have appealed to the Corporation of Madurai to inspect the construction site and advise the NHAI and the contract firm to do the needful.

According to K.S. Arjunan of Sri Nagar near Iyer Bungalow, TANGEDCO issued power shutdown details through the media to facilitate the construction of the bridge work and there was no other relief from the contract firm or the NHAI engineers to the consumers.

The absence of traffic police and lack of street lights at night have resulted in freak accidents. On many occasions, people travelling on the stretch for the first time had narrow escape. Recently, on New Year’s eve, Oomachikulam police had a tough time as many fell from vehicles as the surface was uneven. Many bikers had to be assisted by the police.

KR. Gnanasambandan, a resident of Narayanapuram, said that there was no signboard or reflector stickers to guide road users at night. It was highly dangerous to use New Natham Road as the contractors were least worried about public safety, he charged.

An engineer supervising the bridge work, however, said that they were sprinkling water periodically and ensured that the dust was under control. There were signboards cautioning the road users at select points, he said.

During the transportation of construction materials to the work sites, the contractor’s staff took adequate safety measures as per the standard operations and even blocked vehicular movement for short periods, he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dc9rlk/article30600583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA20CITY-DUST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/pollution-caused-by-ongoing-development-works-results-in-health-hazards/article30600584.ece

336,2020/01/19,Procession adds colour to festival,"A procession added colour to the Paryaya festival celebrations here on Saturday. About 50 cultural troupes and 15 tableaux participated in it. The procession began at 2.30 a.m. from Jodu Katte, passed through Court Road, Diana Circle, Tenkapete, and culminated on Car Street. A large number of people stood on the side of the roads and watched the procession.

While Ishapriya Tirtha Swami, junior seer of Admar Mutt, was carried in a palanquin by the devotees, the palanquins of other seers of Ashta Mutts — Vidyasagara Tirtha Swami of Krishnapur Mutt, Vishwaprasanna Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt, Vidyavallabha Tirtha Swami of Kaniyur Mutt, and Vishwavallabha Tirtha Swami of Sode Mutt — were mounted on decorated carriages.

The practice of mounting palanquins on decorated carriages was started by the late Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt.

A large number of devotees participated in the Maha Anna Santharpane and had their meals. The practice of holding the public Paryaya Durbar at Rajangana in the morning immediately after the ascension to the Paryaya Peetha and holding of the traditional Paryaya Durbar at Badagu Malige was given up this time. The public Paryaya Durbar was held in the afternoon and began at 3.20 p.m. The Paryaya Durbar stage was decorated with different types of flowers.

337,2020/01/19,Ishapriya Tirtha ascends Paryaya Peetha,"Ishapriya Tirtha Swami, junior seer of Admar Mutt, ascended the Paryaya Peetha, also called the Sarvajna Peetha, at Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple here on Saturday. It will be his first Paryaya. The present Paryaya (2020-22) is the 250th Paryaya since the biennial Paryaya system began in 1522.

Ishapriya Tirtha’s ascension gives him the rights to worship Lord Krishna and manage the affairs of the Krishna Mutt/Temple for the next two years.

The idol of Lord Krishna was installed at the temple here by the exponent of Dwaita philosophy Sri Madhwacharaya about 800 years ago. The seers of Ashta Mutts propagate the Dwaita philosophy.

Ishapriya Tirtha went to Danda Tirtha near Kaup, about 12 kilometres from Udupi, and had a dip there at 1.20 a.m. He arrived at Jodu Katte here at 1.50 a.m., where he was welcomed by a large number of devotees and a grand procession began from Jodu Katte.

The devotees carried the presiding deity of the Palimar Mutt – Chaturbhuja Kaliyamardana Krishna in a palanquin. The seers of the Ashta Mutts sat in palanquins and followed the chief deity, with Ishapriya Tirtha leading them. These included Vidyasagara Tirtha Swami of Krishnapur Mutt, Vishwaprasanna Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt, Vidyavallabha Tirtha Swami of Kaniyur Mutt, and Vishwavallabha Tirtha Swami of Sode Mutt.

After having a darshan of Lord Krishna through the Kanakana Kindi at 4.50 a.m., Ishapriya Tirtha offered prayers at the Chandramouleshwara and Ananteshwara temples. He then came to the entrance of the Sri Krishna Temple, where he was welcomed by the outgoing Paryaya seer, Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Palimar Mutt.

Both seers entered the temple and offered prayers to Lord Krishna and Lord Hanuman. Then Vidyadeesha Tirtha, who completed his second Paryaya, handed over the Akshaya patre and sattuga (vessel and ladle dating back to the times of Sri Madhwacharya) and the keys to the sanctum sanctorum to Ishapriya Tirtha, marking the formal transfer of authority from one Mutt to another, to Vishwapriya Tirtha Swami, senior seer of Admar Mutt, who then handed it over to Ishapriya Tirtha Swami.

Ishapriya Tirtha ascended the Peetha at 5.57 a.m. The seers of other Ashta Mutts were later felicitated at Badagu Malige.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/1q0n2q/article30596671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGPALANQUIN-Standalone,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ishapriya-tirtha-ascends-paryaya-peetha/article30596672.ece
338,2020/01/19,Religious texts have solutions to problems: Ishapriya Tirtha Swami,"Ishapriya Tirtha Swami, junior seer of Admar Mutt, said on Saturday that people should follow the path shown by Lord Krishna. He was delivering his acceptance speech after ascending the Paryaya Peetha at the public Paryaya Durbar function held at Rajangana, here. The Admar seer said that all people had problems. Religious texts and the stories in epics, such as the Mahabharata, had solutions to all problems. Lord Krishna was an administrator, a family man, and also good at politics. He had shown how people should excel in their fields, he said.

It was the exponent of Dwaita philosophy, Sri Madhwacharya, who had started the Paryaya system. It was Sri Madhwacharya who guided the success of all the Paryayas, the seer said.

Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami of Palimar Mutt, who descended the Parayaya Peetha, said that he was delighted at Ishapriya Tirtha Swami ascending the Paryaya Peetha. The Palimar seer said that the seers of the Ashta Mutts missed the presence of Vishwesha Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt, who passed away on December 29, 2019.

“He had a lot of achievements to his credit in different fields. It was he who had constructed the Rajangana and later renovated it twice. We all salute his contribution and get inspiration from him,” he said.

“Let the two-year Paryaya of Ishapriya Tirtha be a success and let all his projects get implemented,” Vidyadheesha Tirtha Swami said.

Vishwaprasanna Tirtha Swami of Pejawar Mutt said that it was incumbent upon the younger generation to follow the path shown by their elders. People should realize the importance of their rich cultural and spiritual heritage, cherish it and follow it.

“It is lamentable that people realise the importance of our culture only when foreigners laud it. It is the duty of parents to explain their children about religion and culture,” the Pejawar seer said.

339,2020/01/19,Spiritual leaders show path of contentment: Sitharaman,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday that people can find contentment if they only followed the path shown by gurus or spiritual leaders.

She was giving the felicitation address at the public Paryaya Durbar function held at Rajangana here.

Lauding the contribution of the Ashta Mutts, Ms. Sitharaman said that these mutts had not just given the message of bhakti or devotion but also promoted the oneness of India. It was these gurus which had told the people to follow the right path and exhorted them to do their duty.

It was essential that people follow the path shown by the gurus, she said.

Commending Ishapriya Tirtha Swami for promoting environment protection, Ms. Sitharaman said that the seer was focusing on reducing the use of plastic during his two-year Paryaya period. This showed that it was not just the government but also the spiritual leaders who worked for the good of the society, he said.

Highlighting the importance of the Paryaya system, Ms. Sitharaman delved into the history of the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple.

She said that the exponent of Dwaita philosopy, Sri Madhwacharya had helped rescued a boat in distress near Malpe and found the idol of Lord Krishna in a lump of ‘gopichandan’ which he installed at the Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple in 1278. He then established the eight mutts or ‘Ashta Mutts’ and ordained seers for each of them to worship Lord Krishna in 1298. The Paryayas then lasted for two months each.

It was the seer, Sri Vadiraja, who converted the two-month Paryaya to a two-year Paryaya in 1522 and this tradition was being followed to this day. This heritage was not just historical but also took people back to their roots, Ms. Sitharaman said.

In his felicitation address, M. Veerappa Moily, former Chief Minister, said that Sri Madhwacharya gave spiritual constitution to the country.

342,2020/01/19,Rai charges BJP with dividing society on communal lines,"The former Minister B. Ramanath Rai on Saturday charged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with targeting minority communities and dividing society.

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Rai referred to the protest against the installation of the statue of Jesus Christ in Kanakapura taluk and said one leader of a Hindu outfit from Dakshina Kannada went to Kanakapura to lead the rally and delivered an inciting speech.

Christians in Dakshina Kannada want communal harmony and whenever their places of worship were attacked, they held peaceful protests demanding justice, he claimed.

The community is peace-loving while their contribution to society has been immense. However, the BJP in order to get political mileage is provoking minority communities so that community members resort to protests, he alleged.

Speaking about the accommodating nature of Christians, Mr. Rai said he recently visited New Jersey and a temple there. He was told that the temple was once a church and was donated to be converted as a temple.

Mr. Rai claimed that the gesture was in respect of India that is known for unity in diversity.

Mr. Rai said that branding people anti-Hindu or anti-Muslim or anti-Christian, when they speak about communal harmony, was not good for society.

“Would Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, Vallabhbhai Patel and others who spoke about harmony be branded anti-Hindu?”

The Congress is opposing the CAA, the NRC and the NPR on the ground that they are unconstitutional. The BJP, however, has been inciting people in the name of religion.

Providing opportunities

Currently North America continues to provide a lot of opportunity for the company and it has been trying to cultivate new markets in Europe. “We are looking at Germany, Switzerland in addition to our traditional markets such as France, Nordics,” he said.

“Our strategy remains growing large accounts and opening new accounts, which will become invest accounts in the future. We focus on creating differentiation in focus areas such as analytics experience, automation IoT and cloud. And these are the areas where we continue to focus and make investments,” he added

Since going public the company has done six acquisitions and each one of these capability led acquisitions, actually fits into these buckets, where these have positioned the company very differently in front of its customers, he said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/a80o1e/article30595627.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19BUSANJAYJALONA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/in-fy20-lt-infotech-eyes-double-digit-growth/article30595628.ece
344,2020/01/19,Is the Indian economy staring at stagflation?,"The story so far: The rise in retail price inflation to a nearly six-year high of 7.35% in December has led to increasing worries that the Indian economy may be headed towards stagflation. The current rise in retail inflation has been attributed mainly to the rise in the prices of vegetables such as onions. Still, the steady rise in wider inflation figures over the last few months amidst falling economic growth has led to fears of stagflation. Notably, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh writing in The Hindu in November had warned about the imminent risk of stagflation facing the economy.

What is stagflation?

Stagflation is an economic scenario where an economy faces both high inflation and low growth (and high unemployment) at the same time. The Indian economy has now faced six consecutive quarters of slowing growth since 2018. Economic growth in the second quarter ending September, the most recent quarter for which data is available, was just 4.5%. For the whole year, growth is expected to be around 5%. Most economists have blamed the slowdown on the lack of sufficient consumer demand for goods and services. In fact, insufficient demand was cited as the primary reason behind the low price inflation that was prevalent in the economy until recently. Subsequently, the government and many analysts prodded the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut interest rates in order to boost demand. This led to significant friction between the government and the RBI that led to the exit of several top-ranking officials (including the RBI’s former Governor) from the central bank. Eventually, the RBI under Governor Shaktikanta Das obliged by cutting its benchmark interest rate, the repo rate, five times in 2019.

The expectation among analysts was that these interest rate cuts would spur demand and boost the economy. In the second half of 2019, prices of goods began to rise at a faster pace on the back of the RBI’s rate cuts. But the growth rate of the economy continued to fall significantly. This combination of rising prices and falling growth has led many to believe that India may be sliding into stagflation. Perhaps the only thing right now that stops many from concluding that the economy is in full-fledged stagflation is the fact that core inflation, which excludes items such as vegetables whose prices are too volatile, remains within the RBI’s targeted range.

Can economists explain stagflation?

The conventional view among economists is that there is an inverse relationship between economic growth and inflation. The idea was first proposed by New Zealand economist William Phillips, after whom the “Phillips Curve” is named, based on statistical studies of inflation and unemployment. It later gained widespread acceptance among mainstream economists. The inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment was seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis that inflation helps the economy function at its full potential. The logic behind the belief is that, at least in the short term, inflation (by boosting nominal wages but not real wages) can trick workers in an economy to accept lower real wages. Without inflation, it is argued, workers would be unwilling to accept these lower real wages, which in turn would lead to higher unemployment and decreased output in the economy. At the same time, economists argue that an inflation rate beyond a certain level, at which point labour and other resources in the economy are fully employed, will have no employment or growth benefits. Accordingly, policymakers are often advised to maintain a certain inflation rate to ensure that unemployment is kept to a minimum and the economy is operating at full capacity. The simultaneous presence of high inflation and low economic growth under stagflation, however, challenges the conventional view that inflation helps an economy operate at full capacity. It was the stagflation in the United States in the 1970s, caused by rising oil prices after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut supplies abruptly, which first led many to question the validity of the Phillips Curve.

Why is stagflation a problem?

Economists who believe that the current slowdown is due to the lack of sufficient consumer demand prescribe greater spending by the government and the central bank to resuscitate the economy. But stagflation essentially ties the hands of the government and the central bank from taking such countercyclical policy steps. With retail inflation now well above the RBI’s targeted range of 2-6%, the central bank is unlikely to assist the economy any time soon by cutting its benchmark interest rate. If the central bank decides to inject fresh money into the economy either by cutting its benchmark interest rate or other unconventional means, it could lead to a further rise in prices and make things worse. A similar rise in inflation could result if the government engages in deficit spending that is funded by the RBI. All this is considered to be bad news at a time when the economy, with significant unemployed resources, is not functioning at its full capacity. Stagflation can also be politically costly to the ruling government. On the one hand, the slowdown in growth could affect peoples’ incomes. On the other, higher inflation could cause a reduction in people’s standard of living as they can afford fewer things.

What is the way out?

Economists are divided along ideological lines on what needs to be done for an economy to recover from stagflation. Some economists suggest that policymakers should stop worrying about inflation and instead focus exclusively on boosting aggregate demand in the economy. India’s nominal GDP growth, a measure of the overall level of spending in the economy, is expected to hit a 42-year low of 7.5% this year. They consider the RBI’s target of keeping inflation from rising above 6% as an arbitrary one and believe that the central bank should further ease its policy stance and the government should spend more on infrastructure and other sectors to boost the economy.

Another point raised by these economists is that inflation on the broader level, as measured by the core inflation figures, remains within the RBI’s target range. Core inflation in December was at 3.7%. So greater spending by the government and the RBI will not cause inflation levels to run out of control, they argue. Others, however, are more cautious about advocating a big-spending approach to rescue the economy from stagflation. They point to the fact that monetary easing in the last one year has only raised prices without leading to higher growth rates. So injecting further liquidity into the economy may only stoke higher inflation without boosting economic growth.

Some economists even see the severe drop in consumer demand simply as a symptom rather than as the primary cause behind the current slowdown. According to this view, it is natural for spending to drop after the end of a credit-fuelled boom. India’s growth rate, it is worth noting, was boosted by the availability of easy credit over the last decade, or even longer. Further credit expansion by the central bank and debt-fuelled government spending, these economists argue, will not lead to genuine and sustainable economic growth but only to another unsustainable boom followed by a bust. So they instead advocate supply-side reforms to bring about genuine economic growth.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/ea3874/article24988484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20thrupee,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/is-the-indian-economy-staring-at-stagflation/article30595793.ece
