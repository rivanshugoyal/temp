0,2020/01/27,Badminton | Aces put it across Raptors in a see-saw battle; Adcocks deliver,"It was a see-saw battle between two potent teams, decided only in the final game of the final match. Chris Adcock and Gabrielle Adcock defeated Chan Peng Soon and Eom Hye Won to clinch the tie for Pune 7 Aces here on Monday.

For the rest of the night, there was hardly anything to separate the teams.

Kazumasa Sakai gave Aces the lead, defeating Ansal Yadav in the first men’s singles by employing an aggressive brand of badminton. Ansal kept Sakai moving about the court with his choice of placement, and in the first game, the two contestants were separated by just a point. But Sakai was undeterred; he kept smashing and closed the contest without much ado.

All eyes were on B. Sai Praneeth, the World No. 11, to level the scores and he did. He had the all-round game to unsettle Loh Kean Yew, but suffered a blip towards the end of the first game. Yew was quick and aggressive, and ran away with his momentum to claim a 1-0 lead in the contest, the winning stroke a fierce smash.

The tables turned in the second game as Sai Praneeth led 8-3 at the break. As he revealed to Sportstar later: “In the first game, we started equally and suddenly, he started playing really fast. He changed his pace suddenly and I made a few mistakes. In the second game, initially I got the lead and then I actually got to know how to play because I got a strategy.”

The strategy was to slow the pace of play, and it worked well. Both players were able to capitalise on the slightest opportunity to smash the shuttle-cock, and Sai Praneeth was excellent with his defence as well, retrieving intrepidly. He had the momentum towards the end of the third game, and walked away with a convincing win.

Raptors’ Trump match was expectedly one-sided. Tai Tzu Ying, the World No. 2, brushed aside Rituparna Das with relative ease, albeit with a brief spell of resistance by the Indian.

Aces’ Trump match was then claimed by the strong men’s doubles pair of Chirag Shetty and Hendra Setiawan. The two trailed for a considerable period in the first game but eventually found their rhythm.

It was left to the Adcocks to decide the winner.

The results:

Bengaluru Raptors lost to Pune 7 Aces 4-3 (Ansal Yadav lost to Kazumasa Sakai 14-15, 9-15; B. Sai Praneeth bt Lon Kean Yew 10-15, 15-7, 15-8; Tai Tzu Ying bt Rituparna Das 15-3, 15-9; Arun George & Rian Agung Saputro lost to Chirag Shetty & Hendra Setiawan 14-15, 3-15; Chan Peng Soon & Eom Hye Won lost to Chris Adcock & Gabrielle Adcock 10-15, 15-11, 15-12).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/87cb/article30669037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28-BAD,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/badminton-aces-put-it-across-raptors-in-a-see-saw-battle-adcocks-deliver/article30669038.ece
1,2020/01/27,Golf | Leishman pips Rahm to title,"Australia's Marc Leishman fired eight birdies in a seven-under 65 on Sunday to win the US PGA Tour title at Torrey Pines by one stroke from overnight leader Jon Rahm.

Leishman started the day four shots behind Spain's Rahm, but his storming run gave him a 15-under total of 273.

McIlroy third

Rahm, meanwhile, fired a two-under 70 for 274, two shots in front of American Brandt Snedeker and Rory McIlroy — the Northern Ireland star who could have regained the World No. 1 ranking with a victory.

Leishman drained par-saving putts on the 12th and 14th, and rebounded from his ony bogey of the day on the 17th with a birdie on the last hole that proved enough for victory.

McIlroy and Rahm struggled in the final group, Rahm playing his first five holes in four-over with two bogeys and a double-bogey. An eagle and four of his five birdies on the back nine — including three birdies to end his round — weren't enough to compensate.

McIlroy, meanwhile, began bogey-bogey on the way to 69.

Tiger Woods missed the green on his opening approach and began with a bogey but dropped his approach inches from the cup on the second to set up a birdie and added another tap-in birdie on the par-5 sixth to pull within three strokes of the lead.

The 15-time Major champion finished with four birdies in a two-under 70 that left him tied for ninth on 279. He remains in search of a record 83rd career PGA Tour victory — having tied Sam Snead's mark at the Zozo Championship in Japan in October.

‘Do it for Mamba’

As he came off the course Woods learned of the death in a helicopter crash of Kobe Bryant — the NBA great who started his pro career the same year as Woods.

“People were yelling, 'Do it for Mamba.' Now I understand,” Woods said. “Unbelievably sad.”

Top scores: 273: Marc Leishman (Aus) 68, 72, 68, 65; 274: Jon Rahm (Esp) 68, 71, 65, 70; 276: Brandt Snedeker (USA) 69, 67, 72, 68; Rory McIlroy (NIR) 67, 73, 67, 69.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/hhubs9/article30669012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28PINES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/golf-leishman-pips-rahm-to-title/article30669013.ece
2,2020/01/27,Tata Steel Masters | Viswanathan Anand finishes joint sixth,"Five-time champion Viswanathan Anand finished tied sixth after drawing his 13th-round encounter with Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda in 23 moves in the Tata Steel Masters chess tournament here on Sunday.

Anand aggregated 6.5 points from 13 rounds and shared the sixth spot with three others.

Signs off in style

Fabiano Caruana, assured of the title before the final round, signed off with a win over Russia’s Vladislav Artemiev and matched the record winning score of 10 points from 13 rounds.

Since 1980, when the event became a 13-round competition, only Garry Kasparov (1999) and Magnus Carlsen (2013) have won by scoring 10 points.

Two other previous champions, who won by a two-point margin over nine rounds, were Max Euwe (1952) and Fredrik Olafsson (1959).

Since the inception of the event in 1939, Viktor Korchnoi’s three-point winning margin in 1968, when he scored 12 points from 15 rounds, remains the biggest.

In the Challengers category, Surya Shekhar Ganguly (7.5) drew with Anton Smirnov to finish fifth.

Nihal Sarin (7) defeated Rauf Mamedov to share the sixth spot.

Spain’s David Anton Guijarro won the title with 8.5 points and qualified for next year’s Masters’ section.

The results (13th round): Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Pol) drew with Viswanathan Anand; Vladislav Artemiev (Rus) lost to Fabiano Caruana (USA); Wesley So (USA) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor); Anish Giri (Ned) drew with Jorden van Foreest (Ned); Alireza Fiourzja (FIDE) drew with Daniil Dubov (Rus); Yu Yangyi (Chn) drew with Jeffery Xiong (USA); Vladislav Kovalev (Blr) drew with Nikita Vatiugov (Rus).

Final standing: 1. Caruana (10 points), 2. Carlsen (8), 3. So (7.5), 4-5. Foreest, Dubov (7 each), 6-9. Giri, Anand, Duda, Firouzja (6.5 each), 10-11. Xiong, Artemiev (6 each), 12. Vitiugov (5), 13.

3,2020/01/27,Table tennis | Ankita back with a bang,"For Ankita Das, injuries have helped learn some harsh realities of life. Now on a comeback trail after a ligament tear kept her away for a year, the 2014 National champion is quietly trying to prove her detractors wrong.

On the opening day of the team events of the National table tennis championship here, the 30th-ranked Ankita produced flashes of her brilliance to down 14th-ranked Railway-rival Kaushani Nath in five sets.

Morale-booster

The Siliguri-based Ankita, playing for Bengal ‘B’, scored a morale-boosting win in the opening encounter against former champion Railways.

“In the past year, I have realised only family and close friends help you in times of distress. When I was recuperating from injury, the attitude of my so-called friends from the table tennis circle left me shattered. I needed help from a psychologist to bounce back. Now I am out to prove a point,” said the country’s lone female qualifier in table tennis for the 2012 London Olympics.

After Ankita’s fighting 11-9, 6-11, 5-11, 11-7, 11-8 win, the bespectacled Sagarika Mukherjee twice brought Railways back in the tie by scoring over Sataporni De (11-6, 14-12, 11-8) and Ankita (11-7, 6-11, 11-7, 11-5). In between Sagarika’s twin-strikes, Nikita Sarkar humbled the experienced Railway girl Moumita Dutta 11-1, 11-7, 11-9 in the third singles.

With the teams locked 2-2, Kaushani won the first set 11-8 and Sataporni took the second at 13-11, in the deciding rubber, when the match was abruptly halted to commence the opening ceremony!

This decision presented another example of how less-important players are made to feel on the field of play, that too in the National championship. With all the other matches over for the day, a 15-20 minute wait to complete this match would have not done the championship any harm.

Going by the script

The men’s team action went as per expectations. With holder Petroleum squad expected to arrive on Tuesday to commence its title-defence, last year’s runner-up Gujarat, semifinalists Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, host Telangana, Maharashtra-A, Bengal-A, TNTTA, Railways, Bengal-B, Haryana and Rajasthan have virtually ensured their places in the pre-quarterfinals.

A few surprises came when Telangana stunned UP 3-1 and TTTA humbled last year’s pre-quarterfinalists Karnataka 3-2.

In the women’s section, champion Bengal-A, Petroleum, TTTA, Maharashtra-B, Maharashtra-A, Telangana, Karnataka, Assam, Railways and Bengal-B stayed on course for a place in the round of 16.

In the only minor surprise, Assam’s Trisha Gogoi won her matches against higher-ranked Gujarat’s Namna Jaiswal and Frenaz Chipia in her team’s 3-2 win.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ndndkx/article30668833.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28ANKITA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/table-tennis-ankita-back-with-a-bang/article30668834.ece

5,2020/01/27,Kobe Bryant – basketball superstar and global icon,"The news of retired basketball superstar Kobe Bryant killed along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and others in a helicopter crash has shocked the world. Bryant was poised to receive the Holy Grail of basketball – entering the prestigious Hall of Fame later this year.

Instead, the world will mourn the tragic and premature death of a once-in-a-generation basketball achiever, a five-time National Basketball Association (NBA) championship winner, a former NBA Most Valuable Player, 11-time All NBA first-teamer, 18-time All Star, 9-time All NBA Defensive Team member and owner of other accomplishments.

For all these accolades, Bryant, who wanted to be called the “Black Mamba”, will be known for being the closest to basketball’s best-ever player – Michael Jordan. Bryant was Jordanesque (both were 6’6’’ tall and listed at 220 pounds for large parts of their career) in most aspects of his game – he could score in the paint, rattle the rims with dunks, shoot the three from the perimeter, hit contested shots with a defender’s hand in his face, take over during clutch moments and play the closer, rev up his defensive intensity when needed and bottle up opponent wing players; all of which contributed to his winning five championships with the only team he played for – the Los Angeles Lakers. He was also Jordanesque in his maniacal intensity, whether it was in turning up for practice and goading his teammates to improve, using the NBA off-season to add newer aspects to his repertoire, working on his physical fitness in order to compete and play gruelling minutes game after game and in his dedication to win it all.

Bryant came up just short in the Jordan comparison on one key metric – efficiency. His devotion to doing-it-all led him to take outrageous shots and complaints about hogging the ball and despite his humongous success, he didn’t really scale the Jordan peak. That accolade could be soon owned by current day Laker great LeBron James, but Bryant’s stardom and popularity was as high as any other NBA superstar’s and will remain so. Bryant’s legacy firmly establishes him among the top dozen NBA players ever, with some situating him closer to the Top 6 – a spectacular feat for a player who joined the league right after finishing up high school and remaining with the Lakers all his career.

O’Neal-Bryant dynasty

Kobe’s game also evolved over the years since his NBA entry. In his keenness to emulate Jordan, he started off as a gunner – who could forget his air ball shots against Utah Jazz in the 1997 playoffs? Under the tutelage of coach Phil Jackson, though, Bryant mellowed and bought into the team concept and soon formed a dominant partnership with the-force-of-nature center Shaquille O’Neal. The O’Neal-Bryant dynasty lasted till 2004 with three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002. Bryant and the Lakers were down and out till Jackson returned as coach again in the late 2000s and forged yet another winning team, this time revolving around Bryant’s stardom and leading to two more championships in 2009 and 2010.

In the later phase of his career, Bryant had his detractors who focussed on his return to “hero-ball”, seeking to do it all by himself, instead of buying into Jackson’s winning recipe, the “Triangle Offence”. But even Bryant’s outrageous shot-taking and his endeavour for oneupmanship on the court had its benefits. With defenders drawn to him, Bryant’s misses increased the probability for an offensive rebound for his teammates – something that teammates like Pau Gasol and Lamar Odom feasted on.

Genial and urbane

Off the court, the genial and urbane Bryant was a global icon. Having been brought up as a child in Italy, where his father Joel “Jellybean” Bryant played professional basketball, Kobe was fluent in Italian and Spanish, which helped him reach out to legions of fans in Europe and Latin America. His image suffered a huge blemish after he was accused of raping a 19-year-old in 2003. Bryant always maintained that he had only engaged in consensual sex. After the accuser refused to testify in court, he reached a civil settlement and apologised for the acts, but the incident hurt his legacy both on and off the court. The incident coincided with a tumultuous season for the Lakers in 2004, who disbanded with the departure of the other superstar Shaquille O’Neal.

In his twilight years, the Lakers were a much weaker squad and Bryant played out his career after suffering a devastating Achilles heel injury. His last game with the Lakers as a 38-year-old, however, was memorable – he scored 60 points in a win against the Utah Jazz even as the Lakers finished with a dismal 17-65 record.

Academy Award

After retirement, Bryant focused on venture capital, investing in different businesses such as media, data and technology and also won the Academy Award for the best animated short film, ‘Dear Basketball’ in 2018. His 13-year-old daughter Gianna was also an aspiring basketball player and had her life tragically cut short along with her father’s yesterday.

For a basketball fan, the enduring memory of Bryant would be the shooting guard dribbling the ball down court, swarmed by defenders, going past the paint and pulling up a mid-range elbow jumper for a two pointer with the clock running out. The mid-range pull-up jumper was his go-to move, a shot that he could probably take blindly. He was equally adept at taking fade-aways (another Jordan signature) and using elegant footwork and vertical hang-time to gain space and score at the rim. A man all about balletic grace and robotic intensity, it is unfortunate that his life has been cut short by a tragic accident.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ygwppn/article30663162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKPEOPLE-KOBEBRYANT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/kobe-bryant-basketball-superstar-and-global-icon/article30663163.ece
6,2020/01/27,NBA legend Kobe Bryant killed in helicopter crash,"Basketball icon Kobe Bryant died Sunday in a helicopter crash in Southern California. He was 41.

TMZ first reported Bryant's death. ABC News in Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Times are among the entities that confirmed the death of the former Los Angeles Lakers superstar.

TMZ reported that Bryant's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, also died in the crash. TMZ cited a family representative as the source.

Chief Daryl Osby of the Los Angeles County Fire Department said nobody survived the crash into a hill in Calabasas, which is approximately 30 miles west of Los Angeles. Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said nine people were on the helicopter — a pilot and eight passengers.

Villanueva declined to release identities, saying “it would be entirely inappropriate right now” before coroners go through their process.

Multiple entities reported that Kobe and Gianna were on their way to a basketball tournament in nearby Thousand Oaks.

Tributes pour in

The news of Bryant's death sent shockwaves through the sports world and beyond.

“The NBA family is devastated by the tragic passing of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna,” NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. “For 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning.""

“He was one of the most extraordinary players in the history of our game with accomplishments that are legendary: five NBA championships, an NBA MVP award, 18 NBA All-Star selections, and two Olympic gold medals. But he will be remembered most for inspiring people around the world to pick up a basketball and compete to the very best of their ability. He was generous with the wisdom he acquired and saw it as his mission to share it with future generations of players, taking special delight in passing down his love of the game to Gianna. We send our heartfelt condolences to his wife, Vanessa, and their family, the Lakers organization and the entire sports world,” read the statement.

Former president Barack Obama was among the hundreds of people weighing in on the tragedy.

“Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act,” Obama said on Twitter. “To lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.”

Orange Coast College announced that baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife Keri and daughter Alyssa were among the people killed in the crash.

Alyssa Altobelli was a basketball teammate of Gianni Bryant. John Altobelli, 56, was entering his 28th season as the community college's baseball coach. He won four state championships and recorded his 700th career win last season.

“John meant so much to not only Orange Coast College, but to baseball,” Orange Coast athletic director Jason Kehler said in a statement. “He truly personified what it means to be a baseball coach. The passion that he put into the game, but more importantly his athletes, was second to none -- he treated them like family. Our deepest condolences go out to the Altobelli family during this time of tragedy.”

Details emerging

A fire broke out after the plane landed and emergency personnel responded but found no survivors, according to TMZ.

TMZ reported that eyewitnesses to the crash heard the helicopter sputtering before it went down.

Onlookers came to the scene and stared toward the hill as the brush was still smoldering. People were also gathering at Staples Center, the home of the Lakers, in downtown Los Angeles.

The cause of the crash is under investigation.

After attending high school in suburban Philadelphia, Bryant was the 13th overall pick of the 1996 draft, selected by Charlotte, which traded his rights to the Lakers in exchange for center Vlade Divac. He spent the next 20 seasons in Los Angeles before retiring following the 2015-16 season.

Bryant won five NBA championships for the Lakers and amassed a number of accolades. He was the NBA's Most Valuable Player in 2007-08, a 15-time All-NBA selection, 18-time All-Star and 12-time All-Defensive team member. He twice was named MVP of the NBA Finals and was the All-Star Game MVP four times.

Bryant played in 1,346 career games and retired as the third-leading scorer in NBA history with 33,643 points. On Saturday night, Lakers star LeBron James passed him on the all-time list when he scored 29 points against the Philadelphia 76ers. Bryant stands behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone and James on the all-time list.

Bryant sent out a congratulatory tweet to James on Saturday night.

“Continuing to move the game forward @KingJames. Much respect my brother,” Bryant tweeted.

On Jan. 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors. It is the second-highest total in NBA history, behind only Wilt Chamberlain's famed 100-point game in 1962.

His final game was one for the ages as Bryant scored 60 points during a 101-96 victory over the Utah Jazz on April 13, 2016.

Bryant also won the 1997 NBA Slam Dunk Contest at age 18, the youngest to win the popular event.

Both numbers Bryant wore for the Lakers — 8 and 24 — were retired by the club.

He won Olympic gold medals for the United States in 2008 and 2012 and is among the candidates this year for induction into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.

Reaction from the basketball world and beyond had a recurring theme — disbelief over the news — and one of those grieving was Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal, a former teammate of Bryant's on the Lakers.

“There's no words to express the pain Im going through with this tragedy of loosing my neice Gigi & my brother @kobebryant I love u and u will be missed. My condolences goes out to the Bryant family and the families of the other passengers on board. IM SICK RIGHT NOW,” O'Neal tweeted.

Tweeted former NBA star Dwyane Wade: “Nooooooooooo God please No!”

The sentiments continued all over Twitter.

Pau Gasol, a former Lakers teammate, expressed disbelief: “Beyond devastated... my big brother... I can't, I just can't believe it.”

“I'm stunned. Words can't even come close to describing it. Just an incredibly sad and tragic day,” former Chicago Bulls star and NBA Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen tweeted.

Tweeted Cleveland Cavaliers forward Kevin Love: “Please no. Please god no. It can't be true.”

Clippers coach Doc Rivers expressed his somber thoughts prior to Sunday's road game with the Orlando Magic.

“The news is just devastating to everybody who knew him, knew him a long time,” Rivers told reporters. “... He means a lot to me, obviously, he was such a great opponent, that's what you want in sports.

“He had that DNA that very few athletes could ever have, the Tiger Woods, the Michael Jordans. I was getting to know him more since he retired. ... Yeah, this is a tough one. We have to go play. The news is just so devastating for (his wife) Vanessa, and his family. Just so many people he touched.”

Six years into his NBA career, in July 2003, a 19-year-old hotel worker in Colorado accused Bryant of rape, leading to his arrest. Bryant admitted to a sexual encounter with the woman but said the act was consensual.

When the woman declined to participate in the criminal case, the district attorney dropped the charges and he later settled a civil case out of court in 2005. Bryant did not admit guilt.

Bryant released a statement through his attorneys after the settlement:

“Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. ... After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”

After retirement, Bryant turned his focus to both business and entertainment. He won an Academy Award in the animated short category in 2018 for his work on Dear Basketball, sharing it with Disney animator Glen Keane.

He also saw a $6 million investment he had made in sports drink BodyArmor turn into a $200 million windfall.

Before entering the NBA, Bryant was a star at Lower Merion High in the Philadelphia area and led the school to the 1996 state championship.

“Aces nation has lost its heartbeat,” coach Gregg Downer said in a statement through the Lower Merion school district.

Director of school and community relations Amy Buckman read a statement from outside Kobe Bryant Gymnasium on the Lower Merion campus.

“The Lower Merion school district community is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of our most illustrious alumni in Kobe Bryant,” Buckman said. ”Mr. Bryant's connection to Lower Merion high school, where he played basketball prior to joining the NBA, has raised the profile of our high school and our district throughout the world. Our school community will always be grateful for his ongoing generosity to his alma mater, including the dedication of our Kobe Bryant gymnasium and his support of our girls and boys basketball team.”

A moment of silence was held before Sunday's game in Denver between the Nuggets and Houston Rockets. The public address announcer ended the tribute with “Rest In Peace, Mamba,” referencing Bryant's nickname.

The Toronto Raptors and San Antonio Spurs began their game by letting the 24-second clock run out on both club's first possession, in honor of Bryant's No. 24.

Bryant was also honored outside of NBA circles as a moment of silence was held in his memory prior to a game between San Diego State and UNLV in Las Vegas.

Bryant is the son of former NBA player Joe “Jellybean” Bryant, who played eight seasons with three teams from 1975-83. In 2001, he married Vanessa Laine, and they had four daughters: Natalia Diamante, 17; Gianna Maria-Onore, 13; Bianka Bella, 3; and Capri Kobe, born last June.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/kfof30/article30661117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06isbs-bryant-lG1C530K8P3jpgjpg-27jan,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/kobe-bryant-dies-in-helicopter-crash-in-california/article30661101.ece
7,2020/01/27,Srikanth worried but hopeful of Olympic qualification,"With three months left for the end of the qualification period for the Tokyo Olympics, K. Srikanth is in a race against time.

Battling injury and poor form, the former World No.1 has slipped to 26th in the BWF Race to Tokyo rankings, with B. Sai Praneeth (11), Sourabh Verma (21) and P. Kashyap (22) all positioned ahead of him. As per the BWF’s qualification system, a country may have a maximum of two athletes in each event, provided both are ranked in the top 16 (as of April 28, 2020).

“If I can really get back to the form I was in, then those rankings won’t really matter. There are four Super Series tournaments, the Badminton Asia team championships and individual championships before the qualification period ends. I’m looking at playing them really well. The first thing I’m thinking about is qualifying for the Olympics,” he said on Sunday.

The prospect of not qualifying for the Olympics worried him, admitted the 26-year-old, who was in the city to inaugurate a 4500-square-foot Li Ning ‘superstore’

Time running out

“It’s something that comes once in four years. From 2016, I’ve been the highest-ranked player and suddenly because of the injury I’ve dropped. There will be a little bit of worry for sure. If it was 2018 or 2019 I wouldn’t have worried so much. Because I would have had that 12-month period to come back. Now I have only three months to come back” he said.

Srikanth has endured a rough start to 2020, crashing out in the first round in the Malaysia, Indonesia and the Thailand Masters. The knee injury he suffered last May has proven to be a massive setback.

“I really got injured at the wrong time, when the Olympic qualification period had just started. The injury didn’t let me play the way I wanted to. I was struggling to move on court,” he said.

Impact of injury

The injury’s impact has been as much mental as it has been physical. “After a point, if you’re not really able to play for five-six months, that really stays in your mind,” Srikanth felt.

“Now, every time I want to push myself, in the back of my head I’m scared somewhere if the injury will come back again. But in the last two months, I have been able to do well. I have been doing full sessions. The next three months...I will take it as it comes.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/vr6v3a/article30659454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27SRIKANTH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/srikanth-worried-but-hopeful-of-olympic-qualification/article30659455.ece

12,2020/01/27,Australian Open | Nadal rides out Kyrgios challenge to reach quarter-finals,"Rafael Nadal won a grudge match with Nick Kyrgios to reach the Australian Open quarterfinals and keep the heat on Roger Federer’s record for Grand Slam titles on Monday.

The World No. 1, labelled “super salty” by Kyrgios after he criticised the Australian’s behaviour last year, fought off a furious challenge to go through 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(6), 7-6(4).

As the tennis world mourned the death of Kobe Bryant, Kyrgios arrived at the Rod Laver Arena wearing an LA Lakers shirt.

Court honoured

There was also controversy as Australia’s Margaret Court, often criticised for her deeply conservative views, was honoured for her 1970 calendar-year Grand Slam.

Nadal and Kyrgios had been feuding after some bad-tempered matches but the Spaniard said he was impressed by what he’d seen from the often-temperamental Australian at this tournament.

Fighting back

Kyrgios fought back to challenge Nadal in a high-octane clash played in good spirit, with a polite handshake afterwards — a far cry from some of their previous exchanges.

“When he is playing like today with this positive attitude he gives a lot of positive things to our sport,” said the Spaniard.

“He’s one of the highest talents we have on our tour and I like the Nick Kyrgios during the whole of this tournament.”

13,2020/01/27,Parliamentary panel wants encryption broken in fight against child porn,"Law enforcement agencies should be able to break end-to-end encryption to hunt down distributors of child pornography online, a parliamentary panel has urged as the nation looks to regulate social media.

The panel met officials of companies such as Google , Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp before preparing Saturday's report, which will be considered by several ministries in drafting future policies and law.

“It is a challenge to our collective conscience,” the panel said in the 21-page report reviewed by Reuters, referring to child pornography online.

It sought the “breaking of end-to-end encryption to trace distributors of child pornography”, saying India should require that the originator or sender of such messages be traced once law enforcement becomes aware of the sharing of such content.

The call comes as India finalises other rules to force social media giants to deploy automated tools against unlawful content, fanning industry fears that more regulation could boost compliance requirements.

Facebook's WhatsApp has already been at odds with the government, which has been pushing it to reveal the originators of messages on its platform, amid reports that rumours spread via WhatsApp have led to mob lynchings in recent years.

WhatsApp, which counts India as its biggest market with more than 400 million users, says it provides end-to-end encryption to help protect user privacy, and messages cannot be deciphered by the company or others.

“If a company offers breaking such encryption for child porn, then it will be asked by all agencies,” an industry source who sought anonymity said of the panel recommendation.

“It's like opening secure borders.”

Between 1998 and 2017, about 3.8 million reports of online child sexual abuse imagery originated from India, the world's highest such figure, says the U.S. National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

The panel also recommended mandating Internet service providers to “proactively” monitor, remove and report such content to the authorities. Online search websites should also block searches for child pornography sites, it added.

Adult sections denying entry to underage children should also be incorporated into streaming platforms such as Netflix and social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, the panel added.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/news/8nsz0h/article29499571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-Smartphone-encryption-privacy-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/parliamentary-panel-wants-encryption-broken-in-fight-against-child-porn/article30664815.ece
14,2020/01/27,Facebook blames Apple iOS for Bezos phone hacking,"Facebook has blamed Apple’s operating system for the hacking of Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos’ phone, saying WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption is unhackable.

Investigators believe that Bezos’s iPhone was compromised after he received a 4.4MB video file containing malware via WhatsApp -- in the same way when phones of 1,400 select journalists and human rights activists were broken into by Pegasus software from Israel-based NSO Group last year.

In an interview to the BBC last week, Facebook’s Vice President of Global Affairs and Communications, Nick Clegg, said it wasn’t WhatsApp’s fault because end-to-end encryption is unhackable and blamed Apple’s operating system for Bezos’ episode.

“It sounds like something on the, you know, what they call the operate, operated on the phone itself. It can’t have been anything on the, when the message was sent, in transit, because that’s end-to-end encrypted on WhatsApp,” Clegg told the show host.

Clegg compared the hack to opening a malicious email, saying that “it only comes to life when you open it.”

According to a report from FTI Consulting, a firm that has investigated Bezos’ phone, after that the video file was received, Bezos’ phone started sending unusually large amounts of outbound data, including his intimate messages with his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez.

Also read:

According to Clegg, “something” must have affected the phone’s operating system.

“As sure as you can be that the technology of end-to-end encryption cannot, other than unless you have handset, or you have the message at either end, cannot be hacked into,” he was quoted as saying.

Apple was yet to comment on Facebook’s statement.

The NSO Group has denied it was part of Bezos’ hacking.

WhatsApp provides end-to-end encryption by default, which means only the sender and recipient can view the messages. But the piece of NSO Group software exploited WhatsApp’s video calling system by installing the spyware via missed calls to snoop on the selected users.

According to leading tech policy and media consultant Prasanto K. Roy, end-to-end encrypted apps (E2EE) do provide security, and messages or calls cannot be intercepted and decrypted en route without enormous computing resources.

“But once anyone can get to your handset, whether a human or a piece of software, the encryption doesn’t matter anymore. Because on your handset, it’s all decrypted,” Roy told IANS recently.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/9lj695/article30572806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jeff-Bezos1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/facebook-blames-apple-ios-for-bezos-phone-hacking/article30663412.ece

17,2020/01/27,The infinite hypnosis of the infinite scroll,"It hit me at the middle of my workday. After a three-hour marathon of trying to meet a deadline, I took a break from my laptop screen and walked over to the water cooler — but when I reached there, I realised that I was still screenbound.

This was not the first time I was going from one screen to another. And I am not the first person to use my mobile less for ‘real’ communication and more for endless consumption. I had just scrolled past at least 30 posts alternating between news, outrage, meme, and dog videos — but I could not recall any in particular. One chunk of content blurred into the next, aided by the fog in my brain.

I had to snap out of the hypnotism of infinite scroll.

The overload

According to Reuters Institute’s 2019 ‘India Digital News Report’, “India is emerging as an overwhelmingly mobile-first, and for many mobile-only, media market for internet use broadly, and for online news use specifically”. They found that of their respondents, 68% identify smartphones as their main device for online news, with 31% saying they only use mobile devices to access online news. “Other social media widely used for news include Instagram (26%), Twitter (18%), and Facebook Messenger (16%).”

Despite being in the industry, it isn’t my organisation’s news app that I used to read from, but articles that came to my feed on Twitter. This will seem like an overwritten tale, but there was a time when the first 40 minutes of my day consisted solely of scrolling through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and sharing scanned articles through the direct share button, without exiting the primary apps. I didn’t need to slow down with a newspaper (or its native app for that matter).

There was no reason to look up and look out into the real world either. Sometimes, sucked as I was into the infinitely pouring Magic Treacle Jug of content that I could flick with my thumb, I’d have the most bizarre thoughts: if a crime were to take place on this metro train car, and the suspects are the persons right opposite me, would I be able to help the police with details for a sketch? The infinite scroll had me. It grabbed my eyeballs and didn’t let me look up and around.

Attention-seeking?

“What we are seeing today is just a result of how most tech platforms are making their revenue. Of course, the design incentives are to maximise the amount of time the user spends on the platform, but they are also [to increase engagement] for targeted advertisements. They generate more data on you, so that they can get you to spend more time on their platforms, and because you spend more time there, you give them more data — it is a vicious cycle,” says Gurshabad Grover, research manager at the Centre for Internet and Society, Bengaluru. “As the Free Software Foundation has been putting it for years, we are not the users, we are the used. We are not paying for these services; we are the commodity. This is the attention economy we live in now.”

This wasn’t just on social media. Initially hailed as a revolutionary element of UI design, the infinite scroll quickly became dangerous, making the millions who thumbed along, susceptible to addictive behaviours and patterns.

In his 2017 book Irresistible, Adam Alter, a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business, talks about people slipping into behavioural addictions like online shopping. One example mentioned in the book talks about an “accomplished” woman who had accumulated $80,000 in debt.

It doesn’t take longer than a minute to discover what aids this. Go to a fast fashion site like Asos or H&M and accessory sites like Daily Objects. Select a category, say, of mobile phone cases, and watch the never-ending options unravel as you keep pushing your trackpad up and your screen down. You could have found a case you like, but you don’t stop: perhaps there is another one that is a little better, let us scroll more, just in case.

The infinite scroll is easy navigability in terms of reducing the number of taps or clicks, but it is infinitely debilitating in how it results in decision fatigue, feelings of being frequently overwhelmed, and an overall waste of time.

Sophisticated stream

This is a “dark pattern”. The term, first coined in 2010 by UX designer Harry Brignull, underpins the deceptiveness of certain UI/UX designs in exploiting human psychology. The infinite scroll — whose tangible equivalent is facing a waterfall all day — is possibly the simplest dark pattern.

Features like ‘customers also bought’ on e-commerce sites, or ‘people you may know’ on Facebook are all subsets of the infinite scroll, getting you to invest time and reveal preferences and instincts that you wouldn’t otherwise want to.

“Transactional apps have understood that scrolling is not enough,” says Arjun Arunkumar, UX design lead at Swiggy. “They want users to stop and make a decision, and therefore started [avenues of] discovery,” he says. This is a more sophisticated path towards infinite scrolling in that, the platforms let you personalise how you want to stay glued to them. Therefore, allowing food and restaurant aggregator apps to access my location, means that I’ve let them give me hundreds of options based on distance to where I am.

“This builds up perception of massive choice,” he says, adding that the user will feel like everything that they need can be found on a particular app which does this personalisation well. “The premise is to piggyback on user behaviour. It is a known fact that people engage with scroll, and we build widgets for decisions around this,” Arjun adds.

The scroll on non-commerce apps (like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn) is evolving too. The newsfeed now consists of not only direct updates from the people I’m following, but of other things they’ve commented on or liked too. More intrusively, Twitter also throws into my newsfeed updates from people who are followed by those I follow.

Arjun looks at this phenomenon positively: “People benefit a lot, you get massive reach [on your posts]. Many people are thankful for posts [getting amplified] on LinkedIn. It helps during tough [job-hunt] times.”

The problem is when data from these algorithms are used to dictate creation. Take Netflix’s recommendation engine, for instance. Gurshabad notes that they “take pride in” it, and “it is these very user behaviour statistics that help them make new shows.”

This was obvious in some Netflix original movies my account recommended to me after a Sunday of Hugh Grant rom-coms. The actors were unknown, but the tropes were so templated that it was comical. Yet, I continued to watch, ignoring legendary auteurs and giving into algorithm-driven screenplays — it gave me exactly what I was subconsciously attuned to expect.

Breaking out

“Even though users are beginning to realise [the dangers of] this, one area that is still lacking is a social movement around it. A lot of these platforms are becoming oligopolies, and therefore they don’t have incentive to change — I say this with hesitance, but even if a social movement starts, it is difficult to make a switch,” says Gurshabad.

For me, stopping this unending hypnosis became necessary as I found myself disconnected with the people and spaces around me. I started with the easiest option. Facebook was low-risk, since it was mostly only filled with wedding and baby updates. Twitter too went off my phone — I assigned a work purpose to it, which was news and article-sharing. What was tough, more so for those who wanted to stay connected to me, was my decision to go off Whatsapp.

“Measure something if you want to change it,” says Gurshabad, when asked for the best hack to stay connected without being subject to hyper-consumption. “All smartphones now have a feature where you can see screen-time. Many users don’t realise the amount of time they are spending, without the data to show for it. Personally, I have seen a lot of people change their habits like this,” he adds.

Walking the talk

It has been about 15 months since I have been Whatsapp-free, and what Gurshabad says is true. My phone memory and the one in my head are GBs lighter (think Whatsapp’s infinite scroll into chat history, where you can keep re-reading conversations, going up, and up, and up), and my screen time automatically went from a 10-hour-per-day average to five.

I found less intrusive chat apps for those with whom I needed to stay in daily touch — the more obscure the app, the less its features to keep us hooked unnecessarily.

I did retain the other trap on my phone, Instagram. The platform, which didn’t even introduce web profiles until two years after it launched, is clear in its mobile-first brief and wouldn’t let me post from a desktop.

In ‘Do Social Network Sites Enhance or Undermine Subjective Well-Being? A Critical Review’, a 2017 study published in Social Issues and Policy Review, the authors say that passively using social media may have negative consequence on subjective well-being, while active usage seems to stimulate “feelings of social connectedness”.

The definitions of active and passive engagements can be subjective. For me, following social media hygiene as noted by The Minimalists duo Joshua Fields Millburn and Ryan Nicodemus helped for Instagram.

I trimmed the number of accounts I follow to under a 100. And the contacts who, out of social decorum I can’t unfollow, I muted.

Now, in just a few brief minutes, it tells me, “You’re all caught up”, and I snap back into the real world, notice my desk, leave my phone on it, and head over to fill my bottle at the water cooler.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/xxxt89/article30665552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/infinitescroll2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/how-the-infinite-scroll-creates-major-disruption-in-social-routines-and-mental-health/article30666353.ece
18,2020/01/27,Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visits virus-hit Wuhan as toll rises to 81,"Chinese Premier Li Keqiang will “inspect and direct” efforts to control a virus outbreak in the central city of Wuhan and promised reinforcements, as provincial authorities faced accusations from the public of a failure to respond in time.

Mr. Li, clad in a blue protective suit and mask, thanked medical workers in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and the epicentre of the outbreak, as the death toll rose on Monday to 81.

“Li ... thanked frontline medical workers for their all-out efforts in treating patients and urged them to pay attention to their own protection,” Xinhua news agency said. “He required efforts to guarantee medical resources supply, race against time to treat patients and ensure adequate market supply and stable prices.”

He said 2,500 more medical workers would arrive in the next two days. Mr. Li is the most senior leader to visit Wuhan since the outbreak began. He inspected efforts to contain the epidemic and was shown on state television leading medical workers in chants of “Wuhan jiayou!” — an exhortation to keep their strength up.

He also visited the construction site of a new hospital due to be built in days.

On China's heavily censored social media, where dissent is typically suppressed, local officials have borne the brunt of mounting public anger about the handling of the virus.

Some lashed out at the Hubei Governor, who had to correct himself twice during a news conference over the number of face masks being produced in the province.

“If he can mess up the data multiple times, no wonder the disease has spread so severely,” one Weibo user said.

Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang told state broadcaster CCTV the city’s management of the crisis was “not good enough” — rare public self-criticism for a Chinese official — and said he was willing to resign.

Virtual lockdown

The city of 11 million people is in virtual lockdown and much of Hubei, home to nearly 60 million people, is under some kind of travel curb. People from Hubei have come under scrutiny within mainland China as well, with many facing suspicion from officials about their recent travels.

“Hubei people are getting discriminated against,” a Wuhan resident complained on the Weibo social media platform.

A county in northern China is offering 1,000 yuan ($145) to tipsters who report the presence of anyone from Wuhan who has not registered with authorities, local government TV said.

A small number of cases linked to people who travelled from Wuhan have been confirmed in more than 10 countries, including Thailand, France, Japan and the U.S., but no deaths have been reported outside China. Cambodia confirmed its first case on Monday.

Investors are worried about the impact on travel, tourism and broader economic activity. The consensus is that in the short term, economic output will be hit as Chinese authorities impose travel restrictions and extend the Lunar New Year holiday to limit the spread of the virus.

The total number of confirmed cases in China rose to 2,835, with about half in the central province of Hubei.

As worry grew around the world, Hong Kong, which has had eight confirmed cases, banned entry to people who had visited Hubei in the past 14 days.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9bffk5/article30668738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-patient,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-premier-li-keqiang-visits-virus-hit-wuhan-as-toll-rises-to-81/article30668739.ece

20,2020/01/27,Donald Trump denies telling Bolton Ukraine aid was tied to probe,"President Donald Trump on Monday denied that he told his former National Security Advisor John Bolton that military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev investigating his political rivals.

Mr. Trump’s tweets came after The New York Times reported on Sunday that Mr. Bolton alleges as much in a draft of his upcoming book.

“I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Monday. “If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.”

Citing Mr .Bolton’s unpublished manuscript, NYT wrote that Mr. Trump told Mr. Bolton he wanted to keep frozen $391 million in aid to Ukraine until Kiev helped with a probe into his Democratic rival Joe Biden.

Mr. Trump was impeached last month for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

House of Representatives prosecutors have spent three days laying out a detailed case that Mr. Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart to open investigation into Mr. Biden and the former Vice-President’s son Hunter, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas firm.

Democrats quickly seized on the report to press demands that Mr. Bolton and other key officials be called testify in Trump’s impeachment trial.

A key point of Mr. Trump’s impeachment defence has been that there was no quid-pro-quo. Mr. Trump’s team has maintained that the holdup in aid was separate from his requests for an investigation into the Bidens.

22,2020/01/27,Two Iraqi protesters killed as anti-government unrest persists,"Unidentified gunmen allegedly shot dead two protesters in the southern Iraqi city of Nassiriya after security forces began a crackdown on demonstrations against the country’s largely Iran-backed ruling elite.

At least 75 protesters were wounded in clashes in Nassiriya overnight when security forces attempted to move them away from bridges in the city, police and health source said. On Monday, clashes resumed in central Baghdad as police fired tear gas at demonstrators.

Security officials said the two protesters in Nassiriya were killed late on Sunday by unknown gunmen in four pick-up trucks who attacked the protest camp and set fire to demonstrators’ tents before fleeing the scene.

Anti-government protests erupted in Baghdad on Oct. 1 and quickly turned violent. Security forces and unidentified gunmen have shot protesters dead. Nearly 500 people have been killed in the unrest.

The protests are an unprecedented leaderless challenge to Iraq’s Shi’ite Muslim-dominated elite, which emerged after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003.

Demonstrators are demanding that all parties and politicians be removed, free and fair elections be held and corruption rooted out. The government has responded with violence and piecemeal reform. The international community has condemned the violence but not intervened to stop it.

Operations by security forces to remove the protest camps started after populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said on Saturday he would halt the involvement of his supporters.

Moqtada al-Sadr had backed the demands of protesters for the removal of corrupt politicians and for the provision of services and jobs soon after the demonstrations began in October, but stopped short of calling all his followers to join in.

Demonstrations continued in Baghdad where security forces used tear gas against protesters in central Baghdad. Protests also continued in many southern cities on Monday, resisting repeated attempts by security forces to end their protests.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trcjzb/article30668432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Iraq-police,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-iraqi-protesters-killed-as-anti-government-unrest-persists/article30668433.ece
23,2020/01/27,"Iran airliner crash-lands on highway, injuring two","An ageing Iranian passenger airliner carrying 144 people crash-landed on a runway and skidded onto a major highway next to an airport on Monday, the latest crash in the Islamic Republic as U.S. sanctions bar it from parts or new aircraft.

Authorities said two people suffered injuries in the hard landing of the McDonnell Douglas MD-83 flown by Caspian Airlines in Mahshahr, a city in Iran’s oil-rich southwestern Khuzestan province.

Passengers, apparently in shock, calmly exited the aircraft with their carry-on baggage out of a door near the cockpit and another over the plane’s wing, video from Iran’s Civil Aviation Network News showed. A flight attendant shouted at passengers to calmly walk away as another crew member joined her on the wing.

We crashed. We crashed but we are unhurt, a male passenger said in Farsi in the video. “My hand is shaking. Provincial airport director Mohammad Reza Rezanian said all of the passengers had been safely taken off the plane, which had been flying a route from the Iranian capital, Tehran, some 610km (380 miles) northeast of Mahshahr.”

The plane carried 136 passengers and eight crew members, authorities said.

It seems that tragedy was narrowly avoided, however, as images from the scene showed the plane had ground to a halt not far from a populated area. The plane also missed traffic on a major highway linking Mahshahr to Imam Khomeini Port.

Iranian state television said the plane involved in Monday’s crash-landing came in harder than usual and lost its landing gear as it hit the tarmac.

No landing gear could be seen in pictures of the plane after the crash, but it was not immediately clear if it failed to deploy or somehow collapsed as the jet hit runway at about 7.35 a.m. local time.

The accident is under investigation, officials said.

The McDonnell Douglas MD-83, a single-aisle workhorse introduced in the mid-1980s, largely has been phased out of commercial air travel in the West. American Airlines retired the last of its MD-80 fleet in September.

The plane involved in Monday’s crash-landing in Iran, registered as EP-CPZ, was more than 25 years old. It had flown for airlines in France, Canada, the U.S., Colombia, Burkina Faso and Ukraine before being registered to Caspian Airlines in August 2012.

The incident comes as Iran is still coping with the aftermath of the accidental downing of a Ukrainian airliner over Tehran. The plane was shot down by the Revolutionary Guard earlier this month amid heightened tensions with the United States, killing all 176 people aboard.

Maintenance information regarding the American-built MD-83 that crashed on Monday was not immediately available. However, Iran has struggled to obtain parts for its ageing fleet of airliners amid sanctions by the US.

Under its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, Iran could purchase new aircraft and had lined up tens of billions of dollars in deals with Airbus and Boeing Co., which owns McDonnell Douglas. However, the manufacturers backed away under increasing pressure by President Donald Trump, who ultimately withdrew the U.S. from the nuclear deal in May 2018 and increased tensions with Tehran.

Iran has suffered a series of major aviation disasters in recent decades as its fleet aged. That includes the 2009 crash of a Soviet-era Tupolev Tu-154M flown by Caspian Airlines that took off from Tehran heading to Armenia. Investigators believe an engine failure in plane’s tail caused pilots to lose control and smash into the ground at a high speed, killing all 168 people on board.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/w2xbgb/article30666381.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27IN-IRANPLANECRASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-airliner-crash-lands-on-highway-injuring-two/article30666323.ece
24,2020/01/27,Afghan passenger plane crashes in Taliban-held eastern Ghazni province,"A passenger plane from Afghanistan’s Ariana Airlines crashed on Monday in a Taliban-held area of the eastern Ghazni province, local officials said.

Arif Noori, spokesman for the provincial Governor, said the plane went down around 1-10 p.m. local time (8-40 a.m. GMT) in Deh Yak district, which is held by the Taliban. Two provincial council members also confirmed the crash.

The conflicting accounts could not immediately be reconciled. The number of people on board and their fate was not immediately known, nor was the cause of the crash.

The mountainous Ghazni province sits in the foothills of the Hindu Kush mountains and is bitterly cold in winter. The Taliban control or hold sway over around half the country.

The last major commercial air crash in Afghanistan occurred in 2005, when a Kam Air flight from the western city of Herat to the capital, Kabul, crashed into the mountains as it tried to land in snowy weather.

The war however has seen a number of deadly crashes of military aircraft. One of the most spectacular occurred in 2013 when an American Boeing 747 cargo jet crashed shortly after takeoff from Bagram air base north of Kabul en route to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. All seven crew member were killed. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board investigation found inadequately-secured cargo had shifted during flight, causing damage to the control systems that “rendered the airplane uncontrollable.”

Afghanistan’s aviation industry suffered desperately during the rule of the Taliban when Ariana, its only airline at the time, was subject to punishing sanctions and allowed to fly only to Saudi Arabia for Hajj pilgrimage flights.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/fza6wh/article30665977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CaptureJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/afghan-passenger-plane-crashes-in-taliban-held-eastern-ghazni-province/article30665941.ece
25,2020/01/27,"Slovenia’s PM steps down, urges country to hold early vote","Slovenia’s Prime Minister announced his resignation on January 27 and urged the country to hold an early general election.

Prime Minister Marjan Sarec said he was resigning because of the crumbling support for his minority government in the small European Union nation of 2 million.

Mr. Sarec said he will submit his resignation to the country’s parliament. Lawmakers can then try to form a new government, but Mr. Sarec said he believed an early election was a better option.

“I cannot fulfil people’s expectations at the moment,” Mr. Sarec said, according to the STA news agency. “But I can fulfil them after the elections.”

Finance Minister Andrej Bartoncelj also resigned earlier on January 27.

Mr. Sarec, a former actor and comedian, became the head of Slovenia’s government in 2018. He gathered a liberal coalition sidelining a right-wing party that won most votes at a parliamentary election in June 2018.

Mr. Sarec said he wants to go into an early election and “let people decide whether they trust me,” said the STA report.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eo0gbj/article30665871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26MARJANSAREC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/slovenias-pm-steps-down-urges-country-to-hold-early-vote/article30665872.ece
26,2020/01/27,Iranians should not let Trump harm national unity: Rouhani,"Iranians should not allow U.S. President Donald Trump's “maximum pressure” approach to harm national unity ahead of parliamentary elections, President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on his official website.

Iran's clerical rulers face challenges in keeping the economy afloat under increasingly tough U.S. sanctions imposed by Washington after it withdrew in 2018 from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. Vital oil exports have been slashed.

“We should not let Trump succeed in creating gaps between the establishment and people ... We should remain united ... Don't turn your back on [Feb. 21] elections. Let's have a high turn out,” Mr. Rouhani said.

Iran's hardline Guardians Council, which vets all election candidates, has disqualified about 9,000 of the 14,000 who registered to run in the elections. Moderates say in most cities they have no candidates to enter the race.

Since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, its rulers have swept aside challenges to their grip on power. But the gap between them and the people has widened since last year, when hundreds were killed in anti-government protests.

Tehran also risks a legitimacy crisis amid mounting public fury and international criticism over the belated admission of blame by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards for shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane by mistake.

Angry Iranians took to streets to protest against the delayed admission by the Guards.

The distrust between the rulers and the ruled, combined with economic hardship, bodes ill for the parliamentary vote in February, when Iran's rulers typically seek a high turnout to show their legitimacy, even if the outcome will not change any major policy.

“I am calling on our nation to vote,” Mr. Rouhani said. “Even if you have criticism over issues and problems, please cast your vote.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/27a2mv/article29510590.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-ROUHANI-THNAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iranians-should-not-let-trump-harm-national-unity-rouhani-says/article30663698.ece
27,2020/01/27,Pro-Pakistan elements infiltrating anti-CAA protests in U.S.; pushing own agenda: Indian-Americans leader,"Pro-Pakistani elements have infiltrated the anti-CAA protests in the US to execute their hidden agenda against India, an Indian-American community leader has said.

During a recent protest against the CAA in Washington DC, posters were seen reflective of the presence of pro-Pakistani elements.

Not only this, at least two Pakistani-Americans were among the main organisers of the anti-CAA protests in Washington DC on Sunday, claimed Indian-American community leader Adapa Prasad.

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) came into force in India last December amid protests in India and around the world.

The Indian government has stressed that the new Act does not deny any citizenship rights but has been brought in to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and provide them citizenship.

“Darakshan Raja, a Pakistani-American activist who also co-ordinates Kashmiri separatist protests in Washington DC area along with another Pakistani-American Muslim activist named Khudai Tanveer, were one of the main coordinators of the anti-CAA protests,” Mr. Prasad told PTI.

Mr. Prasad and his team shared videos and pictures of the individuals from the anti-CAA protests in Washington DC, which was attended by more than 500 Indian-Americans from in and around the city.

Mr. Prasad said one of the posters written in Urdu said Hans ke Liya hai Pakistan, Larr ke lengey Hindustan .

“This in English means we easily got Pakistan, now we will fight out to get India,” he said as he shared the picture of the said poster.

“This is disgusting. Pro-ISI and pro-Pakistani elements are using this protest to execute their hidden agenda which is depicted in their own poster,” Mr. Prasad said.

He said the protests are also being misused by pro-Khalistani activists to push their agenda.

“Arjun Sethi, a pro Khalistani activist, was also amongst the coordinators of the anti-CAA rally,” Prasad said.

Mr. Sethi had recently testified before a Congressional Committee on Kashmir.

In recent weeks, some of the Indian-Americans, during private conversation in WhatsApp groups, had expressed apprehensions that their anti-CAA protests could be misused by elements close to ISI and Pakistan.

There had been moments during which the organisers of these protests had increased scrutiny of those trying to lead the anti-CAA protests.

“It could be a trap to portray Indians and Indian Muslims in a negative light by someone, Mike Ghouse, an Indian-American who is the president of Washington DC-based Center for Pluralism, said in a recent blog.

Most of these anti-CAA protestors chant Bharat Mata Ki Jia and carry Indian national flag.

Some of the eye witnesses told PTI that the “Hindustan Pakistan” poster written in Urdu were withdrawn quickly after it came to the notice of some of the organizers.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/2hlrqj/article30624343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGPROTESTFLAGCAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pro-pakistan-elements-infiltrating-anti-caa-protests-in-us-pushing-own-agenda-indian-americans-leader/article30663341.ece
28,2020/01/27,Trump to unveil Middle East peace plan to Israeli leaders this week,"U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to disclose details of his long-delayed Middle East peace proposal to Israeli leaders on Monday, as he attempts to generate some momentum towards resolving one of the world's most intractable problems.

Mr. Trump will hold separate, back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, the head of the centrist Blue and White Party, who is Netanyahu's rival in March 2 elections.

On Tuesday, Mr. Trump will deliver joint remarks with Mr. Netanyahu at the White House, where the president may reveal details of his peace proposal.

The two days of foreign policy meetings will provide Mr. Trump with a contrast from the trial in the Republican-led Senate that is weighing articles of impeachment against him approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives.

But whether it truly will jumpstart the long-stalled effort to bring Israelis and Palestinians together is far from certain.

Palestinians have refused to engage the Trump administration on the effort and roundly denounced a $50-billion economic revival plan it set forth last July to lift the Palestinian and neighboring Arab state economies.

Palestinians fear the plan will dash their hopes for an independent state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

The White House hope was that if Mr. Trump could get the support of both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz for the plan, it would help provide some momentum. A U.S. official said Mr. Trump wants to know both Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz are on board with the plan before announcing it.

Trumps message to both: “You have six weeks to get this [plan] going, if you want it,” the official said.

Having both leaders present helps take the politics out of the effort, said a U.S. source familiar with internal deliberations.

“The rationale...is it depoliticizes this to the point that, no matter what happens on March 2, the two leaders of the two largest parties can potentially be supportive,” the source said.

The Trump plan is the product of three years' effort by senior advisers Jared Kushner and Avi Berkowitz, as well as Jason Greenblatt, who left the government last autumn.

Mr. Trump last year had hoped to release his secret proposal aimed at triggering negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, but was forced to delay it as Mr. Netanyahu struggled to form a governing coalition.

The proposal, more than 50 pages long, aims to take on some of the most difficult issues separating the two, such as the status of Jerusalem. Palestinians want the citys eastern part as their future capital.

Mr. Trump, talking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, said he was eager to release his plan.

“They say that's the hardest of all deals. I love doing deals,” he said.

Mr. Netanyahu, a veteran right-wing leader, faces political and legal troubles at home as he heads for his third election in less than a year, and was indicted on criminal charges in November. He denies any wrongdoing.

Mr. Netanyahu's principal domestic political rival, Mr. Gantz, a centrist former general, last week lifted his objection to having the peace plan published before Israel's March election. He had previously seen it as interference in the vote.

“I am looking forward to meeting the president - a president of utmost friendliness to the State of Israel - on a matter that is very important for the State of Israel - with national, strategic and security ramifications,” Mr. Gantz told reporters as he landed in Washington on Sunday.

“We will hold a back-and-forth, get to know one another, and take it from there.”

But Mr. Trump, preoccupied with November's re-election bid, faces his own political clock, and can ill afford to wait months for Israel to decide its next prime minister, a U.S. official said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wfx0u6/article27397939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-MIDEASTPLAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-to-unveil-middle-east-peace-plan-to-israeli-leaders-this-week/article30663203.ece

The Southeast Asian travel and tourism hub, which recorded its lowest growth rate in a decade last year at 0.7%, has reported four cases of the coronavirus that has killed 80 people in China so far.

30,2020/01/27,Trump wanted aid to Ukraine frozen until it helped on probes of political rivals: report,"U.S. President Donald Trump told a then-top aide in August he wanted to freeze security aid to Ukraine until officials there helped with investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, the New York Times reported on Sunday.

Mr. Trump's statement was described in an unpublished manuscript by former White House national security adviser John Bolton, the Times said in a report that could raise pressure on Republicans to call Mr. Bolton as a witness in Mr. Trump's Senate impeachment trial.

The report, which did not quote the manuscript but cited multiple people describing Mr. Bolton's account, may undercut a key element of Mr. Trump's defense: that there was no quid pro quo when he asked Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskiy to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden in a July phone call.

Mr. Biden is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to oppose Mr. Trump in the Nov. 3 election. His son worked for a Ukrainian energy firm while Mr. Biden was vice president.

In a statement, an attorney for Mr. Bolton suggested that the Times account was accurate and said he had submitted Mr. Bolton's book manuscript to the National Security Council on Dec. 30, a standard security review for classified information.

“It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript,” the attorney, Charles Cooper, said.

The report drew Democratic demands that the Republican-led Senate, which is conducting a trial on whether to remove Mr. Trump from office after his Dec. 18 impeachment by the Democratic-led House of Representatives, call Mr. Bolton as a witness.

Democrats need to win over at least four Senate Republicans to approve the calling of witnesses. Mr. Bolton said this month he was willing to testify in the trial if a Senate subpoena was issued.

Lawyers for Mr. Trump are scheduled on Monday to resume their defense in the impeachment trial stemming from his dealings with Ukraine. A showdown vote on calling witnesses could loom later in the week.

Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and calls the impeachment process a sham. The White House, which with Senate Republican leaders has resisted calling witnesses, did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the New York Times report, nor did Jay Sekulow, who is helping lead the Republican president's defense.

'No defensible reason to wait'

“There can be no doubt now that Mr. Bolton directly contradicts the heart of the Presidents defense and therefore must be called as a witness at the impeachment trial of President Trump,” the seven Democratic House “managers” prosecuting the case against Mr. Trump in the Senate said in a statement.

“There is no defensible reason to wait until his book is published, when the information he has to offer is critical to the most important decision Senators must now make whether to convict the President of impeachable offenses,” it added.

Democrats have said they are eager to hear testimony by Mr. Bolton, who was involved, as his own lawyer previously said, in ”many relevant meetings and conversations” involving issues at the heart of Mr. Trumps impeachment.

Mr. Bolton left his post in September after disagreements with the president. Mr. Trump said he fired him. Mr. Bolton said he quit.

Its clearly damaging, Jonathan Turley, a professor at George Washington University Law School, who was the only witness called by Republicans in the House impeachment proceedings, said of the Times report. It will fuel demands to hear from Mr. Bolton and other witnesses.

But he said the timing just before the first full day of argument by the White House team fueled suspicion it was part of an organized effort and that the senators may not react as the leakers intended.

While the Senate is highly unlikely to remove Mr. Trump from office, he is seeking to limit political damage to his re-election bid.

Long-standing grievances

The House impeached Mr. Trump on charges of abusing the powers of his office by asking Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and of obstructing a congressional inquiry into his conduct.

Mr. Trump's defense argued neither impeachment charge constituted a crime or impeachable offense, that he was within his rights as president to make decisions about foreign policy and what information to give Congress, and that the House pursued a flawed and one-sided process before impeaching him.

According to the New York Times, Mr. Bolton spoke to Mr. Trump in August and raised the $391 million in congressionally approved aid to Ukraine for its war in the countrys east against Russian-backed separatists.

Officials had frozen the aid, and a deadline was looming to begin sending it, Mr. Bolton noted, according to the newspaper.

Mr. Trump had previously rebuffed senior U.S. officials who had called for the aid to be restored, the newspaper said, airing his long-standing grievances about Ukraine, which mixed legitimate efforts by some Ukrainians to back his Democratic 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, with unsupported accusations and outright conspiracy theories about the country.

The newspaper reported that the president's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had also spent months stoking the presidents paranoia about the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the time, Marie Yovanovitch, alleging that she was openly anti-Trump and should be dismissed.

In his August 2019 discussion with Mr. Bolton, the newspaper said Mr. Trump appeared focused on the theories Giuliani had shared with him and had replied to Boltons question that he preferred sending no assistance to Ukraine until officials had turned over all materials they had about the investigation that related to Mr. Biden and supporters of Ms. Clinton in Ukraine.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v8i4x0/article30361757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Trump,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-wanted-aid-to-ukraine-frozen-until-it-helped-on-probes-of-political-rivals/article30662836.ece

The mayor of the Hubei province capital Wuhan, which has emerged as the epicentre of the epidemic outbreak, said he expects another 1,000 new patients in the city, official media reported.

There are signs showing the virus is becoming more transmissible. These walking ‘contagious agents’ [hidden carriers] make controlling the outbreak a lot more difficult, he said.

Mayor Zhou Xianwang said “it was possible to add about 1,000 cases” based on the number of patients in hospital being tested or undergoing observation in the city.

A high power committee, formed to fight the coronavirus epidemic under the chairpersonship of Premier Li Keqiang, on Sunday said the virus’ ability to spread was getting stronger and announced a slew of measures to combat it.

To curb the epidemic, China has decided to adopt a host of measures including delaying and reducing conferences and major events, extending the current Spring Festival holidays and supporting online work.

To reduce population flows, the meeting decided on measures such as extending the Spring Festival holiday, which is scheduled between Jan 24 and 30, and delaying the start of the spring semester at colleges and schools.

It called for maximum efforts to reduce the mortality rate of patients and enhance their treatment.

More research will be conducted on cured patients and treatment measures will be further refined, with more training programmes scheduled for medical workers, an official statement said.

35,2020/01/27,20 Mali soldiers killed at army camp attack near Mali-Mauritania border,"Gunmen attacked an army camp in Mali near the border with Mauritania, killing 20 soldiers Sunday, the government and armed forces said.

The camp in Sokolo in the Segou region remains under the control of Mali’s military, the armed forces said in a statement on Twitter.

Mali’s government said there was significant material damage in the attack, and that reinforcements have been dispatched. Aerial reconnaissance is under way to track down the gunmen, it said in a statement condemning the attack.

Souleymane Maiga, a resident of Sokolo, said the attackers had temporarily taken control of the camp. “The army camp was attacked this morning by gunmen,” he said.

“The attackers temporarily took control of the camp and destroyed everything before leaving. Many of the soldiers who were in the camp took refuge in the village,” he added.

The attack wasn’t claimed but bears the hallmarks of jihadi groups linked to Al-Qaida that are based in the Wagadu forest, located about 50 km from the attacked village.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/4b435b/article30660496.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001O79YPjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/20-mali-soldiers-killed-at-army-camp-attack-near-mali-mauritania-border/article30660495.ece
36,2020/01/27,Protests at Republic Day events across U.S. call for repeal of Citizenship Amendment Act,"A coalition of diaspora organisations marked Republic Day in Washington D.C. by gathering to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and related recent policies of the government as part of a U.S. wide “Day of Action”.

Among the demands of the protesters are that the U.S. State Department “heed the recommendation of the USCIRF [U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom] and impose sanctions on India’s Home Minister Amit Shah,” a statement from the “Coalition to Stop Genocide”, the banner under which the groups have organized, said.

The groups also want U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to designate India in the U.S.’s International Religious Freedom index as one of the 10 countries with severe religious freedoms violations. Protesters are also petitioning U.S. President Donald Trump to ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi to repeal the CAA during Mr. Trump’s proposed visit to India at the end of February.

Some 500-800 individuals were expected, as per Khalid Ansari, one of the organisers, to participate in the Washington DC rally which started at the White House Ellipse and ended at the Indian Embassy about three to four hours later.

Shortly before 11 a.m. those who had gathered near the White House sang Saare Jahan se Accha. A few individuals waved full-size Indian flags, some carried smaller Indian and U.S. flags, while others periodically shouted, ‘Bharat mata ki jai [Victory to Mother India]’.

Vision of a democracy

“Black civil rights activists made this country [the U.S.] a democracy. Where do we find ourselves as Indian Muslims in this moment is to actualise that vision of a democracy,” Sana Qutubuddin, Advocacy Coordinator for the Indian American Muslim Council, told the crowd at the Ellipse.

“Today ideologies of fascism, authoritarianism and Hindutva supremacy are consuming India,” civil rights activist and law professor Arjun Sethi said. Mr. Sethi explained the CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam and restrictions in the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370 (special status for the former State) to the crowd.

The groups and individuals participating are primarily from the Indian-American community, Mr. Ansari said, but other organizations had come to show solidarity. Individuals from other countries were also present, as indicated by a show of hands , prompted by one of the organisers.

“It’s a legislation passed by Parliament. Every citizen has a right to peacefully protest,” an Indian diplomat told The Hindu. “So if it is an Indian law you are protesting, why do you have others there?” the diplomat said.

The protestors ended their rally outside the Indian Embassy. A security cordon had been placed right around the Embassy and police had blocked off a part of Massachusetts Avenue, where the Embassy is.

“ We are not here for a competition We are here for people to understand what the rest of our families back home are going through, what fears we have, “ Ms. Irshad (who only gave her first name) a DC area resident from Bangalore said.

“This is a competition ,” she said pointing to a few individuals on the Embassy side of the security cordon, including Cultural Diplomat at the Indian Embassy Mr. Moxraj, who was shouting slogans at the protestors via a megaphone.

“We are not here for a competition.” Ms Irshad said.

37,2020/01/27,Netflix’s ‘The Goop Lab’: A peek into Gwyneth Paltrow’s holistic wellness empire,"I’ve always told people that my mum was a bit of a hippie growing up. What I really mean is that she is what many in the New Age community call ‘a seeker’ — someone who is looking for answers to the big questions about life and the universe and, fundamentally, happiness and our purpose in it all. As a child, I was often swept along on her many quests. There was the time I was inducted into Reiki on a visit home from boarding school. She told my father and I that we weren’t getting up from the dining table until we figured out where in our chakras our spiritual blocks were, and the crystals we could use to help us move past them. Then there was a phase with Vedic shlokas, a brief stint with yoga and a short one with Wicca. I went along on this journey with a relatively open mind at first, but the more I saw her pivot, and the older I got, the more I started viewing all things New Age with scepticism at best, and all-out derision at worst.

Filling a void?

This isn’t to say I begrudge her any of it, but you’ll understand why I’ve always given Gwyneth Paltrow and her holistic, female-centric portal, Goop, a wide berth. From detox powders and rose quartz-infused water bottles to vaginal steaming accoutrements with dubious claims to improve health — many of which have led to lawsuits from health practitioners — Goop is all about shilling better mental and spiritual health to a largely female audience with spare cash to spend on finding, well, whatever it is they’re looking for, really.

And if Goop is the perfect commercialisation of the search for meaning in perfectly-curated, shoppable form, the new Netflix docuseries, The Goop Lab, is the ideal view into the Goop Lifestyle. Here, members of the team (mostly white, which should come as no surprise to anyone) spend six episodes trying out New Age crazes. This includes doing magic mushrooms in Jamaica in a bid to find out more about their place in the universe. The bit where the guide tells the group, without a hint of irony, that locals have used it to cure physical ailments and can’t figure out why westerners want to take it solely to get high was my favourite. They try something called ‘snowga’ and jump into freezing Lake Tahoe wearing little more than bikinis, attend psychic workshops and find out about their “real” age, which is apparently different from how old they really are.

To each their own

I’m not going to lie, the series gave me a bit of anxiety — watching them go from one experience to another in each episode felt just a little too familiar — but I also can’t stop thinking about how much truth there is to the phrase, ‘to each their own’. It is one I’ve been pondering a lot lately, thanks to having spent months in therapy working through the exact issues I’ve detailed in this piece. Therapy that I’ve paid, what some might call, ludicrously high hourly rates for. Is that really so different from what Goop’s members and the lifestyle brand’s followers are doing?

Some of Goop’s loudest detractors point to the fact that the brand encourages and benefits from selling expensive things to people who are looking for answers, happiness, balance, whatever you’d like to call it. But isn’t the same true of people who go to therapy, or take a holiday to unwind, or spend money on anything that isn’t an absolute necessity? So, should you watch the docuseries? Sure. Some of you may want to watch it the way you do a safari, or any reality series: observing others living their lives in ways so alien to yours that they may as well be another species. Some of you may want to watch it to find inspiration for things that you can try out in your life as part of your quest for spiritual, mental, or physical wholeness. Either way, it will either be entertaining or informative — which is what all good content is, after all. And that may be the secret to Paltrow’s empire.

46,2020/01/27,Tougher norms likely for related-party transactions,"A panel appointed by the capital markets regulator has proposed significant changes to strengthen the regulatory framework for related-party transactions that have been the subject of many corporate governance matters.

A working group, put in place by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in November 2019, has proposed tweaking the definition of ‘related party’. It also proposed that an audit committee approval must be made mandatory for transactions between a listed entity or its subsidiary with its related party.

Definition of RPTs

“... recommended broadening the definition of RPTs (related-party transactions) to include transactions which are undertaken, whether directly or indirectly, with the intention of benefitting related parties,” stated the report while highlighting the fact that entities have used innovative structures in the past to avoid compliance and disclosure requirements.

The panel has proposed that any entity related to the promoter or promoter group should be considered a related party. Further, any entity holding — directly or indirectly along with their relatives — 20% or more stake in the company should also be considered a related party.

The panel also stated that the current regulations appear insufficient to cover transactions wherein a listed entity could transfer its assets to its subsidiary, which thereon, could deal with a related party of the listed firm. In such instances, the panel has proposed that prior approval of the audit committee should be made mandatory.

Such prior approval would be mandatory if the subsidiary of a listed entity enters into a transaction whose value exceeds 10% of the annual total revenues, total assets or net worth of the subsidiary.

Further, to ascertain the materiality of a related-party transaction for prior approval, the panel has proposed lowering the threshold from the current 10% of the annual consolidated turnover to 5%.

47,2020/01/27,"In lawsuit against USCIS, entities seek $350 mn in H-1B fee refunds","A group of entities including a representative assocation, employment and staffing firms in the U.S. has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for unlawfully charging tech firms $350 million in H-1B visa fees. The complaint said, “Defendant has unlawfully charged United States companies approximately $350 million dollars in visa fees over the past six years.”

The case has been filed by ITServe Alliance, iTech US, SmartWorks and Saxon Global. “These companies have presence in India and it is understood that they have been hiring foreign workers, mostly from India, on behalf of small and mid-tier tech firms in U.S.,” said a California-based legal professional.

“Plaintiffs now seek a refund. For the reasons below, this court must set aside visa denials based on the non-payment of this unlawful fee, enjoin the agency from continuing to charge this fee, and refund all payment of these fees for the past 6 years,” the complaint stated.

If won, many U.S. tech firms represented by the plaintiffs, stand a chance to get significant refunds.

The lawsuit will succeed if the plaintiffs can convince the court that the USCIS is unlawfully charging ‘50/50’ companies (businesses with at least 50 employees and 50% of their workforce in H-1B or L status) a $4,000 fee for H-1B visa holders who change status inside the U.S.

The plaintiffs argue the fee should be charged only when a H-1B professional enters the U.S., said a Forbes report. As per the complaint, “An application for a change of status is not an application for admission.”

49,2020/01/27,Singapore air show: IAF aerobatic team Sarang cannot take part due to delay in Ministry approval,"Extreme delay in getting approval from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has meant that the Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter aerobatic team Sarang cannot perform at the Singapore air show 2020. The rejection comes despite Singapore giving extra time for confirmation, official sources said.

“Singapore has conveyed that with very limited time for the commencement of the airshow, there are significant airspace and safety considerations involved which cannot be met within the remaining time frame,” a Defence source said.

The Singapore air show is scheduled from February 11 to 16 at the Changi exhibition centre. The source said approvals were delayed at various levels in the MoD and hence the final decision was delayed. “The file has been with the MoD for over a month with no observations,” the source added.

Delhi unresponsive

“We were hoping the Sarang team would join in. The deadline was December end. But they have still not responded. We cannot wait indefinitely as there are lot of arrangements to be made,” diplomatic sources told The Hindu.

In addition to the participation of Sarang team, Singapore also requested quick confirmation of the participation of IAF Chief at the airshow which is also pending with just two weeks left to the airshow. On this, Singapore has conveyed that they look forward to welcome the participation of ACM Bhadauria and asked India to confirm his participation at the earliest in order to make the necessary arrangements.

Diplomatic sources expressed confidence that the IAF Chief would be able to participate in the airshow. “We ware waiting the confirmation. If it is too delayed they wont get the preferred time for bilateral interactions with various visiting delegations,” a source added.

There are more than 50 countries participating in the Singapore airshow and it is a good opportunity to interact with the visiting military delegations, another source stated.

The Sarang team flies four indigenously built ALH Dhruv helicopters painted in red and white and a peacock figure at the each side of the fuselage. It was formed in 2002 and coincidentally the first public display was on February 23, 2004 during Asian Aerospace at Singapore.The Sarang team is based at Sulur near Coimbatore.

Commenting on the development, former Navy Chief Adm Arun Prakash said on Twitter, “This is Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for participation or visit abroad of Indian military personnel - no matter how high ranking.

The government also came out sharply against the EU Parliament’s decision to discuss the Citizenship Amendment Act, with Minister of Law and Justice Ravi Shankar Prasad dismissing the resolutions critical of India as driven by “Left Parties,” and reiterated the law was India’s “internal matter”.

“Lots of Left parties [at the EU Parliament] have sought this resolution and our External Affairs Minister will engage with them and explain our position,” Mr. Prasad said on Monday, accusing the MEPs of not being “objective”.

The MEA has made no official comment on the draft resolutions, which are backed by six political groups, representing 626 MEPs of the total Parliament strength of 751. While the harshest resolution, invoking the UN Security Council on Kashmir, indeed comes from the “Left-leaning” European United Left/Nordic Green Left group (GUE/NGL); the largest number of MPs belong to the centre-right European People's Party, (EPP) and the centrist Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, S&D.

In addition, at least six to seven of the MEPs, who had been invited to visit Jammu and Kashmir in October 2019 by the government, are members of centrist and right-leaning groups like Renew and European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), which have also tabled resolutions against the government’s actions over the CAA and Article 370.

Distancing itself from the outcome of the resolutions to be debated and voted on later this week, the European Union’s Foreign office said it did not represent the official EU position.

“It is important to recall that these texts are only drafts tabled by various political groups in the European Parliament. Let me also remind you that the opinions expressed by the European Parliament and its Members do not represent the official position of the European Union,” Virginie Battu-Henriksson, EU Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy responded to specific questions from The Hindu.

A French diplomatic source also said Paris continues to believe the CAA is “India’s internal political matter”, and the European Parliament is “an institution independent of Member States and the European Commission.”

However, Ms. Henriksson declined to respond to a question about the government’s call for the EU Parliament to rethink its decision to discuss the CAA.

51,2020/01/27,Coronavirus: Flight to evacuate Indians from Wuhan put on hold,"Hours after earmarking an aircraft on standby for an evacuation flight to Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak, Air India officials called it off on Monday.

Sounded out by the government, Air India pulled out a Boeing 747 for the sensitive operation. “The 423-seater double-decker jumbo aircraft will bring back, among others, students stranded in Wuhan,” an airline official said in Mumbai. The 12-member crew, rostered for a 5 p.m. departure, had been pulled out, he said. It was not clear whether a team of doctors would travel along.

The official said there was a need for clarity on some points. As crew members would run a risk, many said they expected full-body protection kits. There were also questions within the airline on the protocol to be followed to ensure that everyone on the aircraft stood protected, and the aircraft itself did not become a carrier of the virus.

A senior official of the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation said no permission or special dispensation had so far been sought, or granted, for any evacuation flight to Wuhan from any Indian city.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/e0oo1h/article30668358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-AIRINDIA-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-flight-to-evacuate-indians-from-wuhan-put-on-hold/article30668357.ece

The MGSIPA commenced training for the Bangladesh premier civil service, in collaboration with the National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG), said an official statement.

The Bangladesh Administrative Services Officers, who are participating in the programme, include those in the rank of Additional Deputy Commissioners, Additional District Magistrates and Chief Executive Officers of administrative departments. India and Bangladesh signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for training the Bangladeshi civil servants at the National Centre for Good Governance, Mussoorie.

53,2020/01/27,Erasure of ‘Sher-i-Kashmir’ sparks furore,"Regional parties on Monday took strong note of the J&K administration’s decision to drop the title ‘Sher-i-Kashmir’ from police awards, named after National Conference (NC) founder Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah.

NC district president Peer Afaq accused the Union Territory administration of “moves to trim every single symbol of J&K’s political individuality”.

“This administration is after the Sheikh because he is central figure of J&K and will continue to remain so. Such distortions are aimed at changing the history and will not work,” Mr. Afaq said.

“The words ‘Sher-i-Kashmir Police Medal for Gallantry and Sher-i-Kashmir police medal for meritorious service’ shall henceforth be read as ‘Jammu and Kashmir police medal for gallantry and Jammu and Kashmir police medal for meritorious service,” reads the order issued by Principal Secretary, Home Department, Shaleen Kabra.

Mr. Abdullah, who earned the title ‘Sher-i-Kashmir’ (Lion of Kashmir) for working towards a secular and democratic State, was the main political figure in J&K in 1947, who supported the accession of the State with the Union of India and rejected Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s two-nation theory.

‘Very disturbing’

Senior CPI(M) leader M.Y. Tarigami termed the order “highly disturbing”.

“No words are enough to condemn such foolish orders of the administration. By removing names of great leaders like Sheikh sahib, they cannot succeed. Sheikh sahib is a historic personality and his contribution to the history of Kashmir cannot be erased,” said Mr. Tarigami.

Unhappy with the decision, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Muzaffar Baig said, “Sheikh was the tallest leader J&K has produced. I have tremendous respect for him even if I have disagreement with his certain decisions. I don't know [by] who and why this decision was taken.”

The latest development comes just a month after Sheikh Abdullah’s birthday was dropped from the list of State holidays.

“We need not panic as India has not reported any confirmed Novel Coronavirus case. Since we have a direct flight connectivity to Malaysia and Nepal has one confirmed case, we are taking all possible precautionary steps,” said Nikunja Bihari Dhal, State Health and Family Welfare Secretary.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Dhal attended a video-conferencing with Union Health and Family Welfare Secretary for firming up a combined strategy to deal with the outbreak.

“The Biju Patnaik International Airport has not figured in the screening list for the virus outbreak. We have requested the Civil Aviation Ministry to include it so that the suspected case could be detected at the airport itself,” he said.

The State government has opened special wards at the SCB Medical College Hospital, Cuttack, the AIIMS and the Capital Hospital, Bhubaneswar, and the District Headquarters Hospital, Rourkela, for handling the cases, if any, in isolation.

“To sensitise healthcare providers, we have convened a meeting of the heads of all 32 headquarter hospitals in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. They will be handed over basic guidelines pertaining to the coronavirus,” he said.

“Since no vaccine has been developed for the Novel Coronavirus infection, people should take precautions at their own level. Everyone must refrain from touching their mouth and nose with hands. It is advisable to wash hands frequently.”

55,2020/01/27,Fadnavis warns of agitation if Marathwada projects are halted,"Widespread agitations will be held if the Uddhav Thackeray government tries to halt or slow down projects started by the earlier BJP-led dispensation to tackle drought in Maharashtra’s Marathwada region, former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Monday.

He was speaking to reporters in Aurangabad during a one-day token hunger strike by party colleague and former minister Pankaja Munde against what the BJP has claimed is the neglect of the drought-prone region.

“Our government sought permission to construct new projects in Marathwada. We had sanctioned a water grid for the region and had even made of a draft of the plan. These projects should not be halted or slowed down (by the MVA government),” Mr. Fadnavis said.

“If this (water grid) project is brought to a halt, then widespread agitations under the leadership of Pankaja Munde will be held,” he warned.

Mr. Munde said the Fadnavis government had sanctioned works worth ₹32,000 crore and people expected the State government to complete them in time without bias.

“I will meet Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray to discuss issues related to Marathwada. I hope the government will not do anything that will force us to increase the intensity of this agitation,” the former Parli MLA said.

Phulambri MLA and former Assembly Speaker Haribhau Bagade, who was also part of the one-day protest, raised doubts on whether the Shiv-Sena-NCP-Congress government would complete the Mumbai-Nagpur Samruddhi Corridor in time.

57,2020/01/27,"BJP doesn’t want to open Shaheen Bagh route, it’s doing “dirty politics” over this issue: Arvind Kejriwal","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday accused the BJP of playing “dirty politics” over the Shaheen Bagh protest. He dared the Union government to open the road that has been closed due to the agitation, saying they have his permission if they need it.

Mr. Kejriwal said the BJP does not want to open the stretch of the Kalindi Kunj road where anti-CAA protests are going on for over a month as the saffron party is doing “dirty politics” over it.

“Law and order in the national capital entirely lies with the Centre and if they are saying that they need permission from me, I am giving them permission, open the road in one hour,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal said the road is closed in Shaheen Bagh due to which a lot of people are being inconvenienced.

“School children face inconvenience. Passing of ambulances is an issue. The journey that used to be 40-minutes-long is now taking 2-3 hours. I have said this a number of times that everyone can protest democratically but that protest should not hassle people,” he said.

He hit out at BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad over the Shaheen Bagh protest. Mr. Kejriwal asked why Home Minister Amit Shah and Union Ministers Piyush Goyal and Ravi Shankar Prasad were not going to Shaheen Bagh to talk to the people and get them to open the route.

“I can give you this in writing, the BJP does not want to open the route in Shaheen Bagh. It will remain closed till February 8 (election day) and it will open on February 9,” he told reporters.

In a tweet later, Mr. Kejriwal again asked BJP leaders to go to Shaheen Bagh to get the blockade cleared.

“BJP leaders should immediately go to Shaheen Bagh and talk to them [protesters] and get the road reopened,” Mr. Kejriwal tweeted soon after Ravi Shankar Prasad questioned his silence.

Protesters opposing the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and a planned pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC) have been sitting on protest at Shaheen Bagh for over a month now.

The agitators said they will continue their agitation until the government decides to roll back the contentious law and scrap NRC.

58,2020/01/27,Ravi Shankar Prasad hits out at Shaheen Bagh protest,"Senior BJP leader and Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Monday alleged that the Shaheen Bagh protest in Delhi was “a textbook case of a few hundred people trying to suppress the silent majority”, offering a platform to the tukde tukde gang under the guise of opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

He said those trying to fragment India were getting cover at Shaheen Bagh, where the tricolours were being waved. “It is offering a platform to tukde tukde gang elements under the garb of opposition to the CAA. This protest is not just a protest against the CAA, it is a protest against [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi,” Mr. Prasad said at a press conference.

His words echoed a series of tweets from BJP president J.P. Nadda, who accused the Aam Aadmi Party government of being tardy in sanctioning the prosecution of cases against former JNU Students Union president Kanhaiya Kumar and others, referred to by the ruling party as part of the tukde tukde gang.

Mr. Prasad accused both the AAP and the Congress of vote bank politics. “It is important to bring the truth out. [Congress leader] Rahul Gandhi went to the JNU when the tukde tukde gang was raising slogans to divide India. [Delhi Chief Minister Arvind] Kejriwalji also went there. This is their truth, and it is only for vote bank.”

Commuters in distress

He said lakhs of commuters were in distress as they could not go to work, shops were shut and their children were unable to go to school because of the “roadblock [created] by Shaheen Bagh protesters.” He questioned why Mr. Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia were not listening to the “silent” voices of those distressed by the blocking of the road.

Responding to Mr. Prasad’s allegations, Mr. Kejriwal said BJP leaders should immediately go to Shaheen Bagh, talk to protesters and open the road. “People are distressed because of closed roads at Shaheen Bagh. The BJP does not want that the roads be opened. The BJP is playing dirty politics. The BJP leaders should go to Shaheen Bagh, talk to people, and open the road,” he wrote on Twitter in Hindi.

In response to Mr. Prasad’s comments, Congress leader P. Chidambaram wrote on Twitter: “Now, the Law Minister calls the protesters at Shaheen Bagh as part of the tukde tukde gang. The real tukde tukde gang is the ruling party that is determined to divide India on religious lines.”

PTI adds

Mr. Prasad questioned the objectivity of members of European Union (EU) Parliament who have backed resolutions against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), asking if they ever raised their voices over “victimisation” of minority Hindus and Sikhs in Pakistan.

His assertion came after close to 600 lawmakers in the 751-member Parliament moved six resolutions against the CAA, saying the enactment of the law marked a dangerous shift in India’s citizenship regime.

“The government of India has already explained that it [the CAA] is our internal matter. We believe in engagement. Lots of Left Parties there have sought this resolution and our External Affairs Minister will engage with them and explain our position,” Mr. Prasad told a press conference at the Delhi BJP office.

The powerful 28-nation bloc is set to debate and vote on the motion tabled by a large chunk of its members against the CAA.

Asked about the upcoming EU Parliament’s debate, Mr. Prasad asked a counter question, “Have my esteemed friends of the EU Parliament sought to raise a voice over “victimisation” of Hindu girls or a Sikh Granthi’s daughter in Pakistan? It is high time they also needed to be objective.”

The EU Parliament should not take any action questioning the rights and authority of democratically elected legislatures, government sources had said on Sunday.

India hopes that the “sponsors and supporters” of the resolutions will engage with the government to get a full and accurate assessment of facts before they proceed further, the sources had said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/zfj1h/article30109657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29PRASAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eu-parliamentarians-must-speak-against-pakistan-atrocities-on-hindus-sikhs-ravi-shankar-prasad/article30666731.ece

The trial court has issued black warrants for the execution of all the four convicts — Mukesh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Kumar Sharma and Akshay Kumar — at 6 a.m. on February 1.

As the last-ditch attempt, Mukesh through his counsel on Monday sought an urgent hearing on his plea against dismissal of the mercy plea before the top court.

""If somebody is going to be hanged then nothing can be more urgent than this,"" a bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde said while assuring Mukesh's lawyer that his plea would be given due weightage by the mentioning officer.

""Execution case will be given top priority,"" said the Bench, which also comprised Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant.

Later in the day, the mentioning officer considered the urgency of Mukesh's plea and ordered its listing before a three-judge Bench comprising Justices R. Bhanunathi, Ashok Bhushan and A.S. Bopanna at 12.30 p.m. on January 28.

Mukesh had moved the mercy plea after the Supreme Court dismissed his curative petition against his conviction and death sentence. The apex court had also rejected the curative petition of another death row convict Akshay (31).

The other two convicts, Pawan (25) and Vinay, are yet to file curative petitions before the Supreme Court.

The 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"" (the fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in South Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

Six people — Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay, Pawan, Ram Singh and a juvenile — were named as accused. The trial of the five adult men began in a special fast-track court in March 2013.

The prime accused, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar jail days after the trial began.

The juvenile, who was said to be the most brutal of the attackers, was put in a correctional home for three years. He was released in 2015 and sent to an undisclosed location amid concerns over a threat to his life. The juvenile, when released, was 20 years old.

Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay and Pawan were convicted and sentenced to death in September 2013.

On Saturday, a Delhi court said that no further directions were required on a plea by the lawyer of the death row convicts alleging that prison authorities were not handing over certain documents required to file mercy and curative petitions, and disposed of the petition.

Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Kumar Jain said the convicts' lawyer can take pictures of the relevant documents, diary and paintings from the Tihar jail authorities.

62,2020/01/27,We know political parties use SC as a forum to settle scores: CJI,"Chief Justice S.A. Bobde on Monday orally let know that the court is indeed conscious that political parties use it as a forum to settle scores.

The remark came while hearing a petition filed by senior advocate and BJP leader Gaurav Bhatia for a CBI investigation into the deaths of three BJP workers — Shaktipad Sarkar, Tirlochan Mahato and Dulal Kumar — in West Bengal’s Purulia district. Mr. Bhatia claimed that the “brutal killings”, with the body of Kumar found hanging from a high-tension electric post, exemplified the violence meted out by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) to its political rivals.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for the West Bengal government, countered by questioning Mr. Bhatia’s intentions in filing the petition. Mr. Sibal said the court should first examine the issue whether a member of a political party could really file public interest petitions.

To this, Chief Justice Bobde indicated that this was a phenomenon the court has seen on both sides of the political divide. “We are conscious that Opposition parties are also using the forum of this court. This [argument] goes for both sides,” the CJI replied to Mr. Sibal.

Claiming the case to harbour political motives, Mr. Sibal said a board of five doctors had already certified Kumar’s death as suicide. The police have already filed a closure report. Mr. Bhatia has submitted that the trio were threatened by “TMC goons”. However, the court asked the State government to file a response within four weeks.

A similar interaction had occurred between the Bench and Mr. Sibal in the same case in February 2019. The case was then heard by a Bench led by Justice (now retired) A.K. Sikri.

To a question by Justice Sikri as to “what is happening in West Bengal government”, Mr. Sibal, at the time, had retorted “what is happening in the CBI?”. This was heard at the time the CBI was making attempts to arrest then Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar for tampering with evidence in connection with the Sarada chit fund scam.

In the past hearings in the case, the court had voiced doubts whether it should enter the realm of facts in criminal cases like this. Mr. Sibal had agued that factual evidence should be best left to the Magistrate’s court concerned. The court had even asked whether the CBI could investigate cases in West Bengal considering the fact that the State government had withdrawn general consent to CBI’s jurisdiction within its territory.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/iykmu4/article30647848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bobde-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/we-know-political-parties-use-sc-as-a-forum-to-settle-scores-cji/article30666008.ece
63,2020/01/27,SC seeks Maharashtra’s reply on Gawli’s appeal against life term in Sena corporator’s murder case,"The Supreme Court on Monday sought response from the Maharashtra government on a plea by gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli challenging the life term awarded to him in the 2008 murder of Shiv Sena corporator Kamlakar Jamsandekar.

Mr. Jamsandekar was shot dead in his house on March 2, 2007 by two persons, allegedly hired by associates of Gawli who was the then sitting MLA.

Gawli’s appeal challenging the verdict of the Bombay High Court, which had upheld the life term awarded to him by a trial court in the case, came up for hearing before a Bench comprising Justices R. Banumathi and A. S. Bopanna.

The Bench agreed to hear the appeal and issued notice to the State.

The High Court had on December 9, 2019 upheld Gawli’s conviction and life term awarded to him by trial court under various provisions of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA).

Besides Gawli, it had also upheld the conviction and sentence imposed on several other accused in the case by the trial court in August 2012.

“The involvement of accused one Arun Gawli in the murder of Kamalakar Jamsandekar has been proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt,” the High Court had said in its verdict.

According to the prosecution, Mr. Jamsandekar was murdered at the behest of Gawli and the charge sheet filed by the police in the trial court had said that Gawli’s gang was allegedly paid ₹30 lakh for killing the Sena corporator over a land deal in suburban Mumbai.

Gawli, arrested on May 21, 2008, is currently lodged in jail in Maharashtra.

The prosecution had alleged that several accused in the case were members of organised crime syndicate headed by Gawli and they had hatched a conspiracy to kill Mr. Jamsandekar due to political rivalry.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vcnyos/article30665956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THARUNGAWLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-seeks-maharashtras-reply-on-gawlis-appeal-against-life-term-in-sena-corporators-murder-case/article30665957.ece

“The present revision petition has no merits,” the court said.

The additional public prosecutor said Pawan was trying to stall the execution by moving petitions through his father.

Advocate A.P. Singh, appearing for Pawan’s father, claimed that Pawan was a victim of media trial. The sole eyewitness, a friend of the 23-year-old victim, was accompanying her in the bus when the gruesome incident took place. He too had sustained injuries.

A Delhi court had on January 6 dismissed Gupta’s complaint against the sole witness in the matter alleging that he was a “motivated witness.” Pawan’s father had challenged the order in the sessions court.

65,2020/01/27,Delhi HC rejects bail plea of Bhushan Steel ex-CFO Nittin Johari,"The Delhi High Court on Monday dismissed the bail plea of Bhushan Steel’s former chief financial officer Nittin Johari, who was arrested by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) for alleged fraudulent activities.

The verdict by Justice Brijesh Sethi came after the Supreme Court set aside the bail granted to Johari by the High Court in August last year and asked it to hear the matter afresh.

The details of the High Court’s decision to reject his bail plea would be available when the judgment is uploaded on its website.

The apex court’s order had come on an appeal by the SFIO challenging the August 14, 2019 order of the high court.

Johari was arrested by SFIO on May 2, 2019 for alleged fraudulent activities, including filing false documents with various banks.

SFIO had said Johari was managing the affairs of Bhushan Steel and was looking after raising of funds from banks and financial institutions and was also one of the signatories to the financial statements of the company till fiscal year 2016-17.

SFIO had said that during the probe it found there were several alleged fraudulent practices at the company, including manipulations of accounts and financial statements during the term of Johari.

In its order, the High Court had said that it became evident that the “mind and will of the accused company are the main accused – Brij Bhushan Singal and Neeraj Singal, who had been actually controlling the company”.

The High Court had observed that it is a matter of record that main accused Brij Bhushan Singal has not been arrested and co-accused Neeraj Singal has already been granted bail.

SFIO had claimed that Johari was a member of the committee of board of directors on borrowing, investment and loans along with former promoters Brij Bhushan Singal and Neeraj Singal.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-hc-rejects-bail-plea-of-bhushan-steel-ex-cfo-nittin-johari/article30665856.ece
66,2020/01/27,"2G scam case: CBI appeal infructuous in view of new anti-graft law, A. Raja tells HC","Former Union telecom minister A. Raja on Monday told the Delhi High Court that the CBI’s appeal against his and others’ acquittal in the 2G spectrum scam case has become infructuous with the coming of the new anti-corruption law.

Senior advocate Abhishek M Singhvi, appearing for Mr. Raja, told the court that the graft charges levelled against him and others in the case have been omitted in the new Prevention of Corruption Act of 2018 and therefore, prosecution in the instant matter cannot go on.

Apart from Mr. Raja, his then private secretary R. K. Chandolia and former telecom secretary Siddharth Behura have also raised the issue in separate applications filed by them.

During the brief hearing before Justice Brijesh Sethi, the CBI contended that the applications were not sustainable as this specific issue had been raised in the replies filed in response to the agency’s appeal.

However, the CBI’s stand was opposed by Mr. Singhvi who said this specific issue, of what happens to older cases in light of the new law, has been referred to the high court by a trial court dealing with a corruption matter and is still pending here.

Besides that, the changes in the new Prevention of Corruption Act have also been challenged in the Supreme Court where it is still pending, he said, adding that in the present circumstances, the high court may have to refer the issue to the Supreme Court.

Justice Sethi, after hearing the brief arguments, listed the matter for further hearing on January 31.

The CBI and the Enforcement Directorate have challenged the acquittal of all the individuals and companies in the 2G scam corruption and money laundering cases by the trial court.

The CBI had also filed an appeal challenging the acquittal of Essar Group promoters Ravi Kant Ruia and Anshuman Ruia and six others in a separate case arising out of the 2G scam probe.

A special court on December 21, 2017 had acquitted Mr. Raja, DMK MP Kanimozhi and others in CBI and ED cases related to the scam. It had acquitted 17 others, including DMK supremo M. Karunanidhi’s wife Dayalu Ammal, Vinod Goenka, Asif Balwa, film producer Karim Morani, P. Amirtham and Sharad Kumar, director of Kalaignar TV in the ED case.

On the same day, the trial court had also acquitted Mr. Behura, Mr. Chandolia, Unitech Ltd MD Sanjay Chandra and three top executives of Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (RADAG)—Gautam Doshi, Surendra Pipara and Hari Nair—in the CBI’s 2G case.

Swan Telecom promoters Shahid Usman Balwa and Vinod Goenka and directors of Kusegaon Fruits and Vegetables Pvt. Ltd Asif Balwa and Rajiv Agarwal were also acquitted in the CBI case.

On March 19, 2018, the ED had approached the high court challenging the special court’s order acquitting all the accused.

A day later, the CBI too had challenged in the high court the acquittal of the accused in the case.

The ED, in its charge sheet, had alleged that ₹200 crore was paid by STPL promoters to DMK-run Kalaignar TV.

The CBI had alleged that there was a loss of ₹30,984 crore to the exchequer in allocation of licences for the 2G spectrum which were scrapped by the top court on February 2, 2012.

Special Judge O. P. Saini (now retired), however, held that the prosecution had “miserably failed” to prove the charges. The special court, which was set up on March 14, 2011 for hearing 2G cases exclusively, had also acquitted Mr. Ruias and others in a separate case arising out of the 2G scam probe.

In the CBI case, Mr. Raja, Ms. Kanimozhi and 15 others were tried under provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2013 dealing with offences of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery, abusing official position, criminal misconduct by public servant and taking bribe.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/15ifr1/article30665838.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THARAJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2g-scam-case-cbi-appeal-infructuous-in-view-of-new-anti-graft-law-a-raja-tells-hc/article30665839.ece
67,2020/01/27,No scope for outside interference in India’s internal matters: Venkaiah Naidu,"Vice President Venkaiah Naidu on Monday indirectly hit out the European Union (EU) lawmakers for moving resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019, saying India didn’t need “advice or guidance” and there was no scope for outside interference in India's internal matters.

An overwhelming majority of members in the European Parliament have filed six scathing resolutions on the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the amended Citizenship Act.

Mr. Naidu was speaking at the release of a book TRG-An Enigma, a biography of Tilak Raj Gupta, an educationist who pioneered the public school movement in India by taking over the Hans Raj Model School, Punjabi Bagh, New Delhi in 1970. The function was held at his residence in the Capital.

“Our polity and democracy do provide enough space for expressing differences and dissent whenever warranted. As a result, we have emerged as the most vibrant democracy in the world,” Mr. Naidu said.

Some efforts were being made outside India to comment on legislations passed by the Indian Parliament. This was done based on “inadequate knowledge” and “insufficient understanding”. “Such efforts were totally uncalled for and unwarranted. As a mature republic and democratic polity, we are capable of addressing the concerns of any of our citizens and we need no advice or guidance in such matters from others,” he said.

India had withstood various challenges as a republic for 70 years and was now more united than ever before, No one should have concerns in this regard, he said.

“We as a nation are committed to the cardinal principle of ensuring Justice, Liberty and Equality for all of our citizens. While we are capable of addressing our internal matters as evidenced over the last 70 years, let others do so in their respective domain,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aiinmw/article30657633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THNAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-scope-for-outside-interference-in-indias-internal-matters-venkaiah-naidu/article30665676.ece
68,2020/01/27,"CAA: ‘They are mad people. They can do anything’, says Yashwant Sinha","“Pagal log hai. Kuch bhi kar sakte hai [They are mad people. They can do anything]”, quipped former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday on the possibility of the Union government enforcing President's rule in the States ruled by Opposition parties if they refused to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) for a long period.

While pointing out the opinion of experts that as per constitutional position, the States could not defy the Centre's law, he said the “full cooperation” of the States was required to implement anything.

Mr. Sinha said if the Centre issued instructions to the State governments to implement the law but theysat on it for say, six months or two years, “the only instrument the government” has is Article 356 of the Constitution, President's rule.

The situation had led to a state of “constitutional crisis”, Mr. Sinha told reporters here at a joint press conference with Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav.

Mr. Sinha, who was in Lucknow as part of his nationwide Gandhi Peace March, slammed the BJP government for not reaching out to people who are “in fear” and protesting against the CAA and proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

'Botched up exercise'

Calling the NRC in Assam a “botched up exercise,” he said that despite the experience in the State, Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced on the floor of Parliament that there would be a nationwide NRC, without any estimation of the costs and machinery required for it.

He listed three reasons for opposing the CAA. First, he argued, the CAA went against the “basic structure of the Constitution”. Second, it was not required, he said, arguing that the government already had the power to grant citizenship to anybody it wished as per the original law. Third, the “language used in the law” by the government would make it hard to be implemented. “Maybe, their intent is not to implement it but to mislead people”.

Mr. Sinha accused the BJP of trying to divide people along religious lines. “We are going back to the pre-1947 era”, he said.

Mr. Sinha also spoke out in support of the women protesting against the CAA in several cities, terming these sit-ins “spontaneous”.

For that reason, he claimed, ""They [protests] won't be easily suppressed or brought to an end despite the oppression”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7vw2b8/article30665289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YASHWANTSINHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-they-are-mad-people-they-can-do-anything-says-yashwant-sinha/article30665290.ece
69,2020/01/27,"Provisions in Act to protect transgenders totally toothless, says plea in SC","The Supreme Court on Monday asked the government to explain why a law meant to protect the transgender community requires a magistrate’s certificate as a prior condition for the State to even identify a transperson.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued formal notice to the government on the petition filed by Swati Bidhan Baruah, an Assam-based advocate and transgender rights activist, who argued that the “right to self-identification forms part of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution”.

The petitioner, a trans person who was a part of the one of the first litigation for transgender rights in the Bombay High Court, contended that the Transgender (Protection of Rights) Act of 2019 has “instead of furthering or protecting the fundamental rights of transpersons, violates and facilitates the violation of their rights to life, privacy and equality”.

The petition, represented by advocate Rashmi Nandakumar, argued, “The Act provides for a method of state-identification of trans persons by a process of certification by the District Magistrate. The petitioner submits that this method is a disproportionate invasion into the right to privacy of trans persons and is manifestly arbitrary.”

The Act, the plea said, actually sets the clock back and negated even the protections secured to trans persons by the Supreme Court through its 2014 judgment in the NALSA case, which had recognised the discrimination suffered by trans persons and directed the government to protect their fundamental rights.

The petition said the provisions in the Act, intended to grant a right against non-discrimination, were completely toothless. It pointed out that the Act provided “as little as six months’ imprisonment” for person found guilty of endangering the life of or for sexual abuse of a transperson. “The provision violates the right to life of trans persons by prescribing grossly inadequate punishment for heinous acts,” it said.

The apex court had directed the government to include the transgender community to be treated as Socially and Educationally Backward Classes of citizens for the purposes of reservation in education and public sector employment. The Act, however, contained no such measure, it said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k9p0rb/article30066995.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13TRANSGENDERSRALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/provisions-in-act-to-protect-transgenders-totally-toothless-says-plea-in-sc/article30664981.ece
70,2020/01/27,CAA rules expected to seek ‘proof of religion’,"The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) rules are expected to seek “proof of religion” as mentioned in government records, a senior official of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said on Monday.

The draft CAA, 2019, rules are likely to seek documents from applicants that they entered India before December 31, 2014 and that they belong to the six religions exempted under the Act.

The Assam government had requested the MHA to impose a three-month time limit to apply under the CAA and not keep it “open-ended”.

“Any of the applicants living in India before 2014 will have some government document or the other where they would have mentioned their religion, they will have to submit this as proof,” said the official.

The CAA has the provision to grant citizenship to members of six undocumented minority communities — Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who entered India before December 31, 2014.

Though the Act does not mention “persecuted minorities”, the term was included in the statement of objects when the Bill was introduced in Parliament.

Many Opposition members had raised objection on how it will be proved if an applicant indeed was persecuted on religious grounds in the neighbouring countries.

The official said the States would have no role in implementation of the CAA, as citizenship was the domain of the Centre. “The only hiccup will come during the verification stage when the role of local police comes into play, even that can be conducted by central agencies,” added the official.

The West Bengal Legislative Assembly on Monday passed a resolution opposing the CAA. The Rajasthan, Kerala and Punjab Assemblies had passed a similar resolution. Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh wrote an open letter on January 3 that the CAA could be misused for infiltration in the country as “any person claiming to be of the six religions could simply apply in terms of the amended law, prove entry on/before the cut off date and be eligible for citizenship.”

An official said that all applications under the CAA would have to be made online and the final decision to grant citizenship rested with the MHA

Several groups in Assam have opposed the CAA as it ‘violates’ the provision of the 1985 Assam Accord that called for “detection and deportation” of all persons who entered the State from Bangladesh post March 24, 1971.

The Supreme Court-monitored Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC), published on August 31 last, which excluded 19 lakh of the 3.4 crore applicants, was a fallout of the Assam Accord.

The CAA was passed by Parliament on December 11. The MHA notified that the provisions would come into force from January 10.

71,2020/01/27,SC seeks govt response to three Bihar residents' plea to quash NPR notification,"The Supreme Court on Monday sought the government’s response on a petition filed by three residents of Bihar to quash a Ministry of Home Affairs notification for the conduct of the National Population Register (NPR) exercise from April to September 2020.

A Bench led by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde issued formal notice to the government on the petition filed by Udagar Ram, from Madhubani district in the State, and two others.

“The entire exercise of creation and updation of the National Population Register is a gross invasion of privacy of private citizens. The nature of the exercise is manifestly arbitrary with no grounds of ‘doubtfulness’ being specified apart from no guarantee of protection and security of the data/information so collected. Such a database would erode basic freedoms that the persons within India currently enjoy,” the petition, represented by advocate M.R. Shamshad, contended.

The petition said Section 14-A of The Citizenship Act, 1955, and The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, and the Home Ministry notification of July 31, 2019, for conduct of the NPR are violative of the fundamental rights of the Constitution.

It said through the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, the State seeks to invade the privacy of private persons without first establishing that they were acting in an unlawful manner.

There is no probable cause for the State to inquire into the personal details of a private citizen unless an investigation has revealed that the entire population has acted in an unlawful manner, the petition said.

Further, the unlawful State Action of creation and updation of the NPR under the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 is sought to be piggy-backed on the exercise of the first phase of Census of India, 2021.

“Needless to say that the Census is carried out under a wholly different authority, i.e. the Census Commissioner under the aegis of the Census Act, 1948. The Census Act, 1948, also provides that no information collected during the census would be used in civil or criminal proceedings nor would be disclosed, the information collected under the NPR exercise is not guaranteed the same protection,” the petition said.

The Census Act also makes it mandatory for the person to answer the questions asked by a Census Officer, there is no such compulsion in the NPR updation/creation exercise and the NPR Manual does not instruct field workers to clarify the same to persons being asked questions.

Further still, the information being collected under the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 is not guaranteed any protection from misuse under the Rules.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eze8s1/article30653886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-THGRP-COURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-seeks-govt-response-to-plea-by-three-bihar-residents-to-quash-npr-notification/article30664414.ece

While the Mumbai patient, a resident of Tardeo, had visited Shanghai and Guangzhou, the 40-year-old from Pune had recently travelled to Shanghai.

BMC’s executive health officer Dr. Padmaja Keskar said that the Tardeo resident had cough since the past five days and has had one episode of fever on Sunday. “The patient stayed in Shanghai from January 3 to 7 and then in Guangzhou from January 7 to 11. He took a flight via Hong Kong and landed in Mumbai on January 11,” said Dr. Keskar adding that he has no history of contact with any person with similar illness or history of travel to a fish market during his stay.

“The patient is vitally stable and has been put on symptomatic treatment,” said Dr. Keskar. According to the Centere for Disease Control and Prevention, many of the patients in the outbreak of respiratory illness caused by nCoV in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread.

State’s epidemiologist Dr. Pradeep Awate said the Pune patient returned to Mumbai on January 10 and developed symptoms after which he was placed under isolation on Monday.

Discharge policy, repeated tests

Meanwhile, three patients quarantined earlier in Mumbai have tested negative for nCoV but continue to be under observation. State health officials who drafted a discharge policy for these patients said that they will continue to remain in the isolation ward till their repeat samples also test negative. “Fresh samples will be collected on fourth day of admission and once these repeat samples test negative, the patients will be discharged,” said Dr. Archana Patil of Directorate of Health Services (DHS), Maharashtra.

As many as 3,756 travellers were screened till January 26 at the Mumbai airport of which 15 were from Maharashtra. Of these, a total of four are now admitted in Mumbai and one in Pune. The State health officials have urged people to call 104 helpline for queries about nCoV.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less severe ailments, such as the common cold, and others more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

73,2020/01/27,"Muslim personal law is a 'cultural issue', inextricably interwoven with Islam: AIMPLB","The Muslim personal law, which allows practices like polygamy and nikah halala, is a “cultural issue” and inextricably interwoven with the religion of Islam. The Constitution allows the continuance of the different practices of various religions until the State succeeds in its endeavour to secure a Universal Civil Code (UCC), the All Indian Muslim Personal Law Board explained to the Supreme Court on Monday.

The Board, which represents multiple schools of thought in Islam and is committed to protect Muslim personal law in the country, said personal laws do not derive their validity from legislature or any other competent authority. Their sources are the scriptural texts of their respective religions. The personal law does not fall within the definition of ‘laws’ under Article 13 of the Constitution. The validity of a personal law cannot be challenged on the basis of the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution.

The arguments were made in an application filed by the Board seeking impleadment in a writ petition filed by Supreme Court advocate Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay for a judicial declaration that polygamy and nikah halala (bar against remarriage with divorced husband without an intervening marriage with another man) were unconstitutional. The petition wants the court to declare Section 2 of the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 violative of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution, insofar as it seeks to recognise and validate polygamy and nikah halala. Mr. Upadhyay has contended that a “ban on polygamy and nikah halala has been the need of the hour to secure basic rights and in the interest of public order, morality and health”.

But the Board said the petition is a push for a judicial pronouncement to bring the UCC. It argued that even Article 44 of the Constitution only says the State should try for bringing UCC. Article 44 is a directive principle of State policy and not enforceable. Article 44, by necessary implication, recognises the plurality of faiths and permits their continuance.

The application points out that the apex court, in its 1997 judgment in the Ahmedabad Women Action Group case, had already refused to examine whether polygamy in Muslim personal law is illegal and an act of cruelty to women. The court had said the issue should be dealt with by the legislature and not the courts.

Mr. Upadhyay had argued that the practices of polygamy and nikah halala were a cause of injury to women.

The petition had referred to how the apex court had held the instant talaq unconstitutional in August 2017.

However, the Board said the rights of Muslim women were already secure under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act of 1986. The validity of the Act was upheld by the apex court in 2001, it argued.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/jpn9rr/article30370828.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kannur1RegionGCM6SO3DG3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aimplb-moves-sc-for-impleadment-in-pleas-challenging-validity-of-polygamy-nikah-halala/article30663993.ece

A government statement on Monday said arrangements for transport and quarantine of those returning would be made by the Ministries of Health and Civil Aviation. Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba reviewed the situation with the Secretaries of the Ministries of Health, External Affairs, Civil Aviation, Labour and Defence, among others.

After a case was confirmed in Nepal, India has strengthened vigil at the Panitanki entry point in West Bengal.

“We are on high vigil in districts bordering Nepal. Health teams have been deployed at border outposts with Nepal at Jhulaghat and Jauljibi in Pithoragarh,” said a senior official of the Health Ministry.

Health Secretary Preeti Sudan chaired a video conference with the Chief Secretaries and the Directors-General of Police of Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal and Sikkim, which border Nepal, and senior officials of other States to review preparedness.

Negative so far

The virus has so far killed more than 50 people globally. with Wuhan city seeing a rapidly expanding quarantine effort marked by transport shutdowns and other restrictions on movement. In India, as on Monday, 14 samples were screened for the virus and none has tested positive, and 29,707 passengers of 137 flights have been screened.

“The current estimates of the new coronavirus show an incubation period of 2-10 days. These estimates will be refined as more data become available. We are constantly in touch with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to tackle the situation,” said an official of the Health Ministry.

The World Health Organization (WHO) urged countries in South-East Asia to remain vigilant and strengthen readiness to rapidly detect any case of importation of the virus and prevent its spread. “It is time to focus all efforts on readiness guided by whatever is known about the new coronavirus,” said Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO South-East Asia Region.

She said the WHO was working with the countries to roll out guidelines, prioritising reviewing and building capacities for laboratory diagnostic, including referral of specimens and diagnosis; trainings in case management, specimen collection and transportation, and infection prevention and control; logistics support and communicating risks and promoting desired behavior in the community. Two countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region — Thailand and Nepal — have reported confirmed cases.

The Health Ministry maintained that passengers were being screened at 7 airports in India and risk communication and self-declaration were being done at 12 other airports.

'Timely action is key'

“The States have been asked to ensure that medical officers are deputed to coordinate with the airport authorities, while tertiary hospitals are also identified for these airports. They have also been given protocols for contact tracing, and timely collection and transport of samples of suspected cases. The States also need to assess the requirement of personal protection equipment and masks and undertake necessary procurement to ensure sufficient supply,” the Health Secretary said

She said the States were advised to depute a nodal officer for coordinating the efforts of different agencies and update the Union Health Ministry. “The Shipping Ministry has informed that communication has been sent to the port authorities.

Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Monday asked counsel for Nirbhaya gang rape convict Mukesh Singh to approach the Supreme Court registry for urgent listing of the condemned man’s plea against the President's rejection of his mercy petition on January 17.

The Chief Justice orally observed that the plea of a man, whose execution is scheduled for February 1, ought to be given top priority.

The Bench, also comprising Justices Ashol Bhushan and A.S. Bopanna would hear the plea at 12.30 p.m. on Tuesday.

The petition, filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, has sought a stay of the execution of the death warrant. The Sessions Court had ordered the death sentence to be carried out on February 1.

Mukesh has asked the court to call for his medical records, dating back to the time of his arrest and incarceration, which were placed before the President for a decision on his mercy plea. He has also sought for the jail records of his solitary confinement. Death row convicts are placed in solitary confinement.

This development comes shortly after the Supreme Court had rejected a juvenility plea made by another Nirbhaya convict Pawan Kumar Gupta. Pawan had claimed he was a juvenile at the time of the crime.

The Supreme Court had also recently dismissed a review petition filed by another one of the four condemned men, Akshay Singh, to review its May 5, 2017 judgment confirming death penalty in the case.

Akshay, Mukesh, Pawan and Vinay had brutally gangraped a 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012. She died of her injuries a few days later.

76,2020/01/27,"Now, govt goes for 100% stake sale of Air India","The Union government on Monday invited bids for 100% stake sale of Air India (AI) and transfer of management control along with its complete share in two subsidiaries-low-cost international carrier Air India Express and ground-handling arm AISATS. The government has offered to hive off liabilities worth nearly Rs 40,000 crore to sweeten the deal.

This is the second attempt in two years by the Narendra Modi-led government at privatising the national carrier. On May 31, 2018, when the deadline for bids closed, not even a single private player had shown interest.

On the table is 100% stake in AI, 100% stake in AI Express Limited (AIXL) and all of the government's 50% stake in AI-SATS, which is a joint venture with Singapore-based ground handling company SATS Limited.

The new buyer will get a total of 146 aircraft, 56% of which are owned by the airline group, while the remaining are on lease. It will also benefit from as much as 50% of international market share held by Indian airlines as well as the airline’s 4,400 airport slots at airports in the country and 3,300 slots in 42 countries, which will be available at least for six months after the sale is complete. As many as 9,617 permanent employees, including pilots and cabin crew with deep technical and operational expertise, will be up for grabs along with the airline’s brand as well as the famous “Maharaja” and “Flying swan” logos.

Any private or public limited company, a corporate body and a fund with a net value of Rs 3,500 crore will be eligible to bid. The last date for submitting interest to the transaction advisor is March 17 and the outcome of this round will be known by March 31, following which qualified bidders will be given two months to submit financial bids.

Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri said at a press conference, “There is a lot of interest [in Air India's sale]. Today's attempt is qualitative different from the previous attempt. Air India and Air India Express are a great asset”.

The liabilities

But the private player keen to buy Air India will also have to take on liabilities of Rs. 32,474 crore, which includes the airline's debt of Rs 23,286 crore. The government will absorb Rs 56,334 crore in liabilities, including Rs 36,670 crore of debt. These have been transferred to a special vehicle known as Air India Assets Holding Limited (AIAHL), which will also comprise real estate and other assets worth Rs 17,000 crore. Therefore, the net liability to be borne by the government will be Rs 39,259 crore.

“The debt which has been built up due to cumulative losses isn’t the debt which can be passed on because it will not be sustainable. Sustainable debt equal the written down value of the assets, which is basically the planes in this case,” Secretary, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), T K Pandey, told reporters.

Kapil Kaul, CEO of aviation consultancy CAPA, said, “A clean exit by the government and exclusion of the entire non-aircraft related debt signal a bold reform and a very determined effort to exit the airline to allow the tax payers funds to be utilised for the government's social agenda. This may be the single biggest write-off by the government”.

As far as the future of the employees is concerned, Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani said, “All employees will go to the new buyer. There are no excess employees in Air India”. The buyer should retain these employees for a certain lock-in period, which would be divulged in the share purchasing agreement. The government was exploring different modalities to ensure that the retired staff have a medical cover, he added.

After the sale is over, government employees will no more be required to travel mandatorily by Air India to seek a full refund.

The bid document also states that the existing FDI (foreign direct investment) policy, which allows a foreign airline to buy upto 49% in Air India will continue to apply. The substantial ownership and control will also have to rest with an Indian national.

Asked how the attempt to sell the airline was different from the previous one, Secretary of Ministry of Civil Aviation P S Kharola said, “This time we have offered 100% equity sale, while it was 76% sale last time. Last time, we said we will remove a debt of Rs 29,000, while this time we have said the debt will be fixed at Rs 23,000 crore, which gives a lot of certainty in the minds of the bidder”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2o50mi/article30662854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRINDIA-STAKESALETHNAKa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-invites-bids-for-100-stake-sale-in-air-india/article30662855.ece
77,2020/01/27,National Commission for Protection of Child Rights needs counselling on own rules: Activists,"Activists, lawyers, academicians and many others have written collectively to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) asking it to counsel its own top brass on the law from which it derives its powers as well as international covenants it was created to safeguard instead of issuing orders to ‘identify’ and ‘counsel’ children at the site of anti-CAA protest in Shaheen Bagh here.

“We condemn the blatantly political intervention of the NCPCR in the Shaheen Bagh protests by threatening action against the children of the women protesting there. Many of the undersigned have been regularly joining the protests at Shaheen Bagh and have witnessed the children there firsthand. The children are secure in the company of their mothers, grandmothers, aunts, neighbours and friends. They are not in the least traumatised,” reads the letter, which has urged Chairperson of the NCPCR Priyank Kanoongo to withdraw its orders. The signatories include well-known lawyer Geeta Ramaseshan, writer and women’s rights activist Susie Tharu, film-makers Sherna Dastur and Samina Mishra, All India Democratic Women’s Association, among many others.

Last week, the NCPCR wrote to the District Magistrate of south-east Delhi to instruct police officials to identify children suffering from “mental trauma” due to ‘rumours’ and send them for counselling, while referring to the protest at the Shaheen Bagh. The DM has to submit a report within 10 days of receiving the letter.

The letter cites from rules of the NCPCR to demonstrate that its order contravenes them. As per the rules, the rights’ body must “ensure its work is directly informed by views of children to reflect their priorities and perspectives”.

It adds that it is the NCPCR’s duty to report to higher authorities if children have expressed the fear of loss of citizenship and being thrown into detention camps. Referring to the Commissions for the Protection of Child Rights Act, 2005, which gave birth to the NCPCR, the signatories ask why it did not conduct its own enquiry before writing to the DM.

It also refers to several Sections under the United National Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the right to freedom of assembly, expression and thought to show how the NCPCR has turned a blind eye to the very law it was constituted to protect and uphold.

The signatories have also questioned why the NCPCR responded to an anonymous complaint while its own code of conduct forbids it from doing so. The have also appealed to the DM to meet and allow them to present evidence to bolster their case.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/national-commission-for-protection-of-child-rights-needs-counselling-on-own-rules-activists/article30661037.ece
78,2020/01/27,Anti-CAA resolutions are political statements: Shashi Tharoor,"Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said the resolutions against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, passed by several Assemblies recently, were “political statements” through which they had conveyed their apprehensions over the Centre’s intent behind linking nationality with religion. “The States want the Union government to know of their unhappiness,” he said.

Interacting with journalists at the Jaipur Literature Festival, Mr. Tharoor said the Centre should listen to the views of the States, as it would need their cooperation if it wanted to move forward from the CAA for preparing the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“What will the Centre do if the States refuse to make their employees available for enumeration? The idea of mentioning dubious citizenship against names in the proposed NRC is purely the BJP’s creation... It is rightly being opposed,” the former Union Minister said.

The Thiruvananthapuram MP said Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s victory would be completed if the CAA-led to NPR and NRC in which large sections of population would be deprived of their rights if they failed to prove their citizenship. “A choice between Jinnah’s idea of the nation and Mahatma Gandhi’s idea is still available to us. The BJP is justifying Jinnah’s logic through CAA.”

Mr. Tharoor said the enactment of the CAA and the BJP’s intention to bring in the NPR and the NRC amounted to fulfilment of Jinnah’s two-nation theory with which the Lahore resolution was passed in 1940. “From wherever Jinnah is, he would say he was right that Muslims were a separate nation and deserved a separate homeland because Hindus could not be just towards them,” he said.

The Congress leader said he had tried to stop the introduction of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament and spoken against it with a firm belief that religion could never be the basis for determining the citizenship. “Mahatma Gandhi and all of our freedom fighters believed that all religions were equal. Prayers from all religions were recited in Gandhiji’s meetings... Even if you are an atheist, this is your country.”

Asked about the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi giving subsidised electricity and water supply to the people, Mr. Tharoor said the Congress was in favour of giving revenue earned by the State to poor sections of society, who could not enjoy the benefits of economy. “If you give subsidies to the undeserving people, the State will go bankrupt,” he said.

Earlier, Mr. Tharoor’s latest book, “The New World Disorder and the Indian Imperative”, which he has co-authored with Observer Research Foundation’s president Samir Saran, was launched at a session at the JLF. The two authors conversed with Irish economist and writer David McWilliams at the session.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/6izq5w/article30660952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13Jaipur-Literature-Festival2601JPR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/anti-caa-resolutions-are-political-statements-shashi-tharoor/article30660953.ece
79,2020/01/27,"Economic slowdown may impact poverty alleviation, says Abhijit Banerjee","Nobel laureate and economist Abhijit Banerjee on Sunday said the slowdown in the economy, which had posed a serious challenge to the country, might adversely impact poverty alleviation because the urban and rural sectors depended on each other for creation of jobs and availability of low-skilled workers. “There is no early end to the economic slowdown that has gripped India,” he said.

At a session on “Poor economics: fighting global poverty” at the Jaipur Literature Festival here, Dr. Banerjee said it might take a long time to get out of the difficult situation, as there was not enough money to improve the economy. “There is a need to work on several things gradually. We have a great demand deficit... People are not spending because they are not confident.”

The Indian-American economist, who along with two others won the Nobel Economics Prize in 2019, said the slowdown in the urban sector was bound to have “negative consequences” for the entire economy. “Besides, the banking sector is stressed and the government is not in a position to bail it out,” he said.

Laying emphasis on a multi-pronged approach for poverty alleviation, Dr. Banerjee said it required “many silver pallets rather than a single silver bullet” to deal with the issue. “Like cancer, poverty has several problems. Some people are education-poor, some are health-poor and some asset-poor. You have to figure out what is missing.”

Dr. Banerjee said the subsidies were important for the poor and should not be done away with. The people living in abysmal poverty should be helped with some assets, he said, adding that it would encourage them to keep trying and work harder. “The confusion arises when subsidies are given to those who may not need them,” he said.

The 58-year-old economist said the country needed a “better Opposition” for effective governance. “When the Opposition is weak, it can lead to a situation where the government can think it can do anything.”

Even the ruling party should want a better Opposition to keep it under check, Dr. Banerjee said, while affirming that the link between authoritarianism and economic success was often an illusion. He said the foreign investors would get nervous if the government failed to provide them with the reliable data, which would help in more investments and ensure global participation.

Asked if could have won the Nobel Prize if working in India, Dr. Banerjee said he had benefited enormously from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is Professor of Economics, as it has the world’s best Ph.D. students. “My students, friends and collaborators have worked for me. There is no dearth of talent here [in India] but bringing together people on a large scale changes it... It is difficult to do it alone.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8f80c7/article30660727.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06Jaipur-Literature-Festival2601JPR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/economic-slowdown-may-impact-poverty-alleviation-says-abhijit-banerjee/article30660728.ece
80,2020/01/27,Oncologist from Chennai among Padma awardees from Assam,"Boxer Mangte Chungjeijang Mary Kom of Manipur leads the list of 15 Padma awardees from the northeast followed by former Nagaland Chief Minister S.C. Jamir, once the bete noire of the extremist National Socialist Council of Nagaland.

Olympic medallist and the only woman to become World Amateur Boxing champion six times, Ms Kom is among seven to be named for the Padma Vibhushan while Mr. Jamir is among 17 on the Padma Bhushan list.

But the buzz in the northeast has been around 13 Padma Shri awardees — five from Assam, two each from Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram and one each from Manipur, Meghalaya, Sikkim and Tripura.

Home away from home

Two of the awardees who made the region their home, are from south India. Oncologist Ravi Kannan is from Chennai and heads a cancer hospital in southern Assam’s Silchar while social worker Sathyanarayanan Mundayoor, popularly know as ‘Uncle Sir’, who fuelled a book-reading revolution in Arunachal Pradesh, is from Kerala.

“When I came to teach at a Vivekananda Kendra school here, people found it difficult to pronounce my name. Children started calling me Uncle Moosa and it stuck. Many call me Uncle Sir too,” said Mr. Mundayoor, who opened the Bamboosa Library in Lohit district headquarters Tezu in 2007 and encouraged the locals to set up “book repositories” in villages.

Around the same time that year, Dr. Kannan joined the Cachar Cancer Hospital after quitting the non-profit Adyar Cancer Institute in Chennai. Under his stewardship, the Assam hospital has expanded from 25 to 100 beds besides regularly organising home visits and satellite clinics to take cancer care to remote villages.

“I never imagined I would be spending so many years and make Assam my home,” Dr Kannan told newspersons in Silchar some time ago.

Honouring dance

The other Padma Shri winners from Assam include Indira P.P. Bora, who played a key role in taking Sattriya dance out of the confines of satras, or Vaishnavite monasteries, to the world beyond which led to the Sangeet Natak Akademi recognising it as one of India’s classical dance forms two decades ago.

The others from Assam are Kushal Konwar Sarma, a veterinarian who has earned the moniker ‘Haathi (elephant) Doctor” for his expertise on pachyderms, Assamese writer and educationist Jogendra Nath Phukan, and Lil Bahadur Chettri, a Nepali writer whose novel Bassain (Mountains Painted with Turmeric) was turned into an Oscar-nominated film.

Nurturing nature

Growing turmeric of the unique, high-curcumin Lakadong variety earned the Padma Shri for Meghalaya’s Trinity Saioo. A teacher, she has mobilised more than 800 women to grow this tuber sustainably in the Jaintia Hills.

“My teaching experience helped add science and pest management to the traditional but low-yielding way of growing the Lakadong turmeric, which is high on demand,” she said.

Apart from Ms. Kom, two sportspersons from the northeast — archer Tarundeep Rai of Sikkim and footballer Oinam Bembem Devi of Manipur — were conferred Padma Shri.

Kamlova and Lalbiakthanga Pachuau of Mizoram and Benichandra Jamatia of Tripura were conferred the award for literature and education.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oncologist-from-chennai-among-padma-awardees-from-assam/article30661253.ece
81,2020/01/27,It’s a long road to joy for these adopted children,"Nine-year old Arun (name changed) was returned by three families between 2015 and 2019 after he spent varying periods — four months to nearly two years — with them as either their adopted son or soon-to-be adopted son. Now, the government’s apex adoption body has stopped any further attempts at placing him with a family so he can be counselled and healed of the trauma caused by multiple rejections.

The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) has recorded 246 instances of disruption over a period of five years between 2014-15 and 2018-19, which translates into six in 400 children being returned at an advanced stage of adoption. On an average there are 4,000 legal adoptions annually within and from India, as per official data. With the number of such cases showing a recent increase, CARA has begun a nationwide capacity building programme for social workers who help assess the suitability of the adoptive family and prepare a child for a new home.

CARA’s CEO, Lt. Col. Deepak Kumar, says, “This is not a happy situation. Children returning to the institution after being placed with a family face rejection and are scarred for a long time. In order to check this trend we formed a sub-committee of experts last year who travelled to different States to help us build capacity among social workers. A media report cited that there were 1,100 disruptions over the last five years, which is incorrect, as the correct figure is 246. We need to understand the difference between parents withdrawing from the adoption process for various reasons after accepting the profile of a child, and those who return the child after taking them in pre-adoption foster care, which is called disruption. While the former is about helping parents take an informed decision on adoption, the latter is completely detrimental to the best interests of the child.”

He adds that there have also been 10 dissolutions since 2015 when CARA underwent a massive reform. In such cases, parents return the child after they have received the adoption order from a court, which can take a year, if not more.

Adjustment problems

Arun was returned for varying reasons. First, the single adoptive father reported that there were problems in adjustment between his first adopted son and Arun. The second time, the adoptive family, not fully recovered from the loss of their 21-year-old biological child, would compare him with Arun and could not accept the new member. A third family saw that Arun could not forget the relationship he had developed with the earlier family with whom he had spent nearly two years and was unable to erase those memories, and thought it best to return him.

Last January, CARA formed a nine-member sub-committee of child rights activists, members of SC-appointed child welfare committees (CWCs), and adoptive parents. The panel developed a training curriculum and held three-day workshops in 12 States. The objective was to educate social workers about their responsibilities such as ensuring vaccination, adequate nutrition and medical assistance, and addressing special needs of children. The trainees learn to better assess the suitability of parents who wish to adopt and to counsel and prepare children, especially the older ones.

“The response has been very overwhelming and for most participants it is their first such training exercise. We try to use our personal experiences and teach the social workers to put themselves in the place of the prospective parents and to understand the anxiety and vulnerabilities of parents. At the same time, the children can’t be treated like files and papers. For these children adoption is not merely about a new home, or toys or a cycle. The child has to be taught about permanence of a relationship and familial bonds,” says Seema Khandekar who is part of the sub-committee, Chairperson of a CWC in New Delhi and a mother to two adoptive daughters.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/s6wf9h/article30660772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/orphan-p1-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/its-a-long-road-to-joy-for-these-adopted-children/article30660773.ece
82,2020/01/27,Fund crunch hits MGNREGA scheme,"The Centre is on the verge of running out of funds for the crucial Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme.

More than 96% of the allocated money has already been spent or is needed to pay pending dues, with less than ₹2,500 crore left to sustain the scheme for the next two months.

Fifteen States are already in the red. According to the scheme’s financial statement as on January 26, Rajasthan has the highest negative net balance of ₹620 crore, followed by ₹323 crore in Uttar Pradesh.

In fact, the situation on the ground may be worse as States do not always enter pending payments into the information system. “January, February and March are months with little agricultural activity, when rural workers desperately need employment. However, the scheme is running out of money, and will enter next year with pending liabilities,” said Rakshita Swamy of the People’s Action for Employment Guarantee movement.

A number of economists have recommended that putting money into the hands of rural consumers via MGNREGA is key to kickstarting the economy. However, this year’s budget allocation was ₹60,000 crore, lower than the amount spent in the previous year.

Also Read What is the lowdown on MGNREGA funding?

In Rajasthan, for example, workers wages have not been paid since the end of the October. Last week, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanding that the Centre immediately release pending dues of ₹1,950 crore.

“There is an outstanding liability of ₹848 crore for payment of wages and ₹1102 crore for materials,” Mr Gehlot said in the letter, a copy of which has been seen by The Hindu.

“Rajasthan has been able to generate Fund Transfer Orders for payment of wages within 15 days for 99.57% of workers and within 8 days for 90.31% of workers, which is an unprecedented achievement.” But wages have not been paid to workers since October 11, 2019 as the Centre has not released funds. This is contrary to the spirit of the Act and violates the principle of rights-based implementation of the MGNREGA scheme.”

After the letter was sent, the Centre released about ₹200 crore and cleared dues until the end of October, said a senior Rajasthan official who did not wish to be named.

“There is a high demand for work this year as the rural economy is in distress and informal employment has also collapsed. Our original labour budget was for 23 crore person-days, but that was revised to 30 crore person days and we will definitely exceed that by the end of the year,” said the official.

“Apart from pending dues which the CM has mentioned, we will need another ₹600 to 700 crore,” he added.

Also Read Government to peg MGNREGA wages to inflation in bid to hike incomes

Other States still have funds remaining, but activists say this is only because they are actively suppressing demand and turning workers away. In Karnataka, where many districts have been declared drought-hit, people are eligible for 150 days of work. However, they are not even able to get work for 100 days, says Abhay Kumar, State coordinator of the Grameen Coolie Karmikara Sangathan (GCKS), a registered union for rural workers.

“Wages have not been paid since October. When there are huge pending dues, the State government does not want to be liable to pay interest for delayed wages, so they suppress demand. Workers are being turned away from panchayat offices saying there is no available work, or they are being discouraged from demanding work by being told there will be a four month delay in wage payment,” said Mr. Kumar.

He is also a member of the Central Employment Guarantee Council, a forum that has not met in two years despite it being mandatory to hold a meeting every six months. The GCKS is planning to file a Public Interest Litigation petition in the State High Court, demanding immediate payment of wages, as well as compensation for delays beyond the minimal interest.

This year’s budget allocation for the scheme was only ₹60,000 crore, lower than the amount spent in the previous year.

“January, February and March are months with little agricultural activity, when rural workers desperately need employment and MGNREGA sees huge demand. However, the scheme is already running out of money, and will enter next year with pending liabilities yet again,” said Rakshita Swamy of the People’s Action for Employment Guarantee movement, expressing the hope that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will announce a more generous allocation for the scheme in the upcoming Budget.

Addressing the fourth batch of the secretaries who had just completed their two-week long training at the District Police Training Centre, the SP said that despite best efforts of the police, the incidence of child marriages, women trafficking, dowry harassment, suicides among women, eve-teasing and ragging were pervasive in the society, particularly in the rural areas.

Mr. Senthil Kumar said the newly-trained batches should work at the grass-root level, be in touch with the police officials at the village and mandal level and strive to eliminate the evils from the society.

“The station house officers must extend the best cooperation to the women protection secretaries. Their mutual cooperation would help reduce crimes against women and children,” the SP said.

The senior police officers said that the Mahila Samrakshana secretaries could take the lead in initiating the sensitization drive for the parents and girl students. Problems such as stalking, blackmailing, circumstances, which lead to abetment of suicides, could be tackled through awareness programmes and interaction with those facing the threats, the police personnel observed.

With a timeframe of about 60 days from the Republic Day to Ugadi in March, the civic body has come up with the slogan ‘Every Saturday Sundara Anantha Day’ with the focus of the campaign being cleanliness, filling of potholes, repairing and painting the boundary walls and road dividers, widening of existing roads, and development of greenery at all possible places.

MP donates pay

District Collector Gandham Chandrudu, who is the special officer of the AMC, formally launched the programme by accepting a cheque for ₹1.75 lakh from Anantapur MP Talari Rangaiah (one month’s pay) towards the cleanliness drive.

The special sanitation programme will identify small stretches of roads and drains every week for the NGOs, government officials, students and the general public to take up the drive, on 34 roads.

In order to make the city ‘pothole free’ by the end of February, an estimated 3,600 sq.mt of potholes have been identified and widening of 31 major roads to ease the traffic congestion with a total length of 12.34 km has also been proposed.

An area of 1,32,575 sq.ft of wall and 56,023 sq.ft of dividers have also been identified on all the major roads for painting that will depict portraits of prominent persons and historical places highlighting the culture and tradition of Anantapur district.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/citizens-drive-to-beautify-anantapur-launched/article30667782.ece
88,2020/01/27,Kurnool lawyers stage protest,"Lawyers sat down in protest at the Gandhi statue near the Zilla Parishad office in the city on Monday demanding that all political parties must accept the High Court being set up in Kurnool. They criticised the TDP for blocking the Bill in Legislative Council and termed the move by the party as anti-constitutional.

Kurnool District Bar Associations’ Joint Action Committee Convener Y. Jaya Raju said that the move by the TDP was deplorable. “The TDP misused a constitutional forum like the Council for their personal gains,” he added.

Mr. Jaya Raju welcomed the YSRCP government’s move to abolish the Legislative Council. “As they have not discharged their constitutional responsibility, and as they are only making politics out of it, there is no use of continuing the Council,” he added.

The protests got support from Kurnool MP Sanjeev Kumar and Bojja Dasaradha Rami Reddy, president of the Rayalaseema Saguneeti Sadhana Samithi.

Mr. Kumar said that former Chief Minister and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu was doing injustice to the people of Rayalaseema. “Being a person from Rayalaseema, he is hoodwinking the people of Rayalaseema,” he added. The MP said that the government would make sure that all regions would develop equally.

Mr. Rami Reddy alleged that political parties had been hoodwinking Rayalaseema people since 1953. “In 1953 political parties made sure that there was no water for the region. In 1956, the capital was shifted from Kurnool to Hyderabad. In 2014, Rayalaseema was again kept aside due to Samaikya Andhra agitation and Amaravati was declared the capital city,” he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kurnool-lawyers-stage-protest/article30667751.ece

He said it was a black day in democracy as the Legislative Assembly passed a resolution abolishing the Council on Monday. He said the government chose to screen Shariff's ruling on decentralisation and repeal of CRDA Bills in Assembly and at the same time it should have shown how Ministers and ruling party MLCs behaved with the Chairman after he gave his ruling.

Mr. Nazeer said it was not right to criticise the Chairman who discharged his Constitutional duty. He said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was going ahead with his decisions without taking views of seniors and others into consideration.

94,2020/01/27,Guntur Collector allays fears on tremors,"Seismic changes below the earth’s surface are causing tremors in Guntur and Krishna districts which are not alarming, said District Collector I. Samuel Ananda Kumar.

There was some panic early on Monday when tremors were felt at Bellamkonda and Atchampet.

Mr. Samuel Ananda Kumar told media persons that tremors were felt at Bellamkonda, Vellaturu mandals for about four minutes. “The tremors are now new in these parts as tectonic plates below the earth’s surface move slightly and sometimes, the tremors are not felt at all. The CSIR-NGRI Seismological Centre at Mylavaram has reported 13 tremors since December 2019 and chief scientist from CSIR-NGRI, Hyderabad was here recently to examine this phenomenon and the studies proved that there was nothing alarming about this incident,” said the Collector.

Accelerometer sensors

The phenomenon could also be due to continuous rainfall witnessed in 2019 as water could have seeped into the earth’s surface and the tectonic plates adjust by themselves. The phenomenon is good as it could prevent earth quakes. The Irrigation Department has also placed accelerometer sensors at Pulichintala reservoir to verify if there was any impact on the dam too, the Collector said.

“This type of tremors are described as after shocks and the studies said that there were 42 after shocks in this region from December 2019 and the after shock on Sunday was recorded at 1.7 on Richter Scale. After speaking to scientists at NGRI, Hyderabad, I came to a conclusion that there was no need for any panic,’’ said Mr. Samuel.

The district administration has also arranged accelerometers at Papayepalem near Bellamkonda.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/guntur-collector-allays-fears-on-tremors/article30667367.ece

Rajasekhara Reddy to revive the Council.

Telugu Desam leader and MLA Kinjarapu Atchannaidu told reporters at the party office in Mangalagiri that Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy was trying to undo the legacy of YSR by taking the decision to dissolve the Council.

In the video footage, Mr. Naidu was seen speaking against the Council by making a strong pitch against its revival stating that the exercise would impose a heavy financial burden on the State and delay the passage of bills.

“Now, we have 294 members in the Legislative Assembly, who are young, intelligent and educated. What is the need of the Legislative Council, when we have such a large number of educated people in the House, except for rehabilitating disgruntled Congress leaders? Further, the council can block the passage of bills up to a maximum period of four months,” questioned Mr. Naidu in 2004.

103,2020/01/27,Excise officials launch massive campaign to destroy ganja plantations in Vizag Agency,"Officials from the Visakhapatnam rural police and the Excise and Prohibition Department are on a massive campaign to destroy ganja plantations across various Agency mandals in Visakhapatnam district.

Since the last three weeks, ganja plantations in about 512 acres in the areas of Paderu and Pedabayulu interior areas have been destroyed. Officials say that each acre of ganja plantations can yield around 500 to 700 kg ganja. Approximately ₹75 crore worth ganja is estimated to be have been destroyed and the campaign is expected to continue for the next couple of weeks.

Security issues

Conducting raids over the ganja plantations and destroying them during cultivation stage is not a new strategy from the officials. During the year 2018-19, hundreds of ganja plantations spread across 10 mandals in the Agency areas of the district had been damaged. However after the brutal murder of Araku TDP MLA Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former MLA Siveri Soma by the Left Wing Extremists (LWE) on September 24, 2018, such raids were stopped due to security issues. Even in the year 2019, there was no permission from rural police to take up any such campaign due to LWE movement in several regions.

Delay in campaign

According to officials, most of the crop was harvested during the late November or early December. However, many farmers are yet to receive crop in several areas.

“Due to cyclones, heavy rainfall and flood-like situation last year, many farmers started cultivation late. Moreover during June 2019, when we created awareness about the action initiated against ganja cultivation and their producers, many farmers took time to start cultivating the crop, feeling that their crop might be also damaged. So there are still plenty of acres left where farmers need to get the crop,” said Inspector of Special Task Force (STF) of Excise and Prohibition Department, Anakapalle, K. Kameswara Rao.

According to a senior official from the Excise Department, based on credible information, the police and the excise teams are able to conduct raids in interior locations on hilly terrains.

“We are taking the help of drones after reaching specific locations. After confirmation, the plantations are being destroyed. Raids will continue in many more locations,” he said.

However, it was learnt that the officials were asked not to conduct any raids in areas of G. Madugula, Munchingputtu, G.K. Veedhi and Chintapalle due to the LWE movement.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/excise-officials-launch-massive-campaign-to-destroy-ganja-plantations-in-vizag-agency/article30666293.ece

105,2020/01/27,A healthy campaign to reduce mortality,"The ‘100,000 Lives Campaign’ has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality in the American health care system as quality came to play a pivotal role. As its title suggests, the initiative is aimed at saving 100,000 lives every year by adopting proven best practices in hospitals across the entire spectrum of services and the results have been impressive.

T.S. Ravi Kumar, president of All India Institute of Medical Sciences at Mangalagiri (AIIMS-M) in Guntur district, has conceived a similar strategy for India to save 300,000 lives every year keeping in view the need to mitigate the phenomenal disease burden imposed by the lack of access to quality medical care.

As one of a 10-member committee, which drafted the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s Global Patient Safety Interprofessional Curriculum Guide, Dr. Ravi Kumar reported to the Director-General of Health Services (DGHS), which nominated him to be a part of the WHO exercise, that a set of ‘never events’ have to be followed in hospitals so that morbidity and deaths can be reduced.

‘Never events’

Some ‘never events’ might look trivial, like preventing a patient from slipping and falling at hospitals, but they are important for sending back the disease-stricken people home hale and heartly. Then there are far more serious and dangerous ‘never events’ like the ‘retention of foreign objects’ in operated patients, according to him.

“These are all preventable harms, which the patient safety cell of DGHS has taken note of. It is fine-tuning the National Patient Safety Framework for achieving the desired outcome. A delegation of the WHO will be coming to India soon for taking the joint initiative forward,” Dr. Ravi Kumar said in an exclusive interview to The Hindu. Dr. Ravi Kumar observed that there were mistakes in nursing care, mismatched blood transfusions, deaths of low-risk mothers etc. which could be prevented. Besides, there were ‘near misses’ of unplanned events which could have fatal consequences for the patients, Dr. Kumar said, recalling the anxious moments he had been through while assisting Ellison C. Pierce who is considered a pioneer in reducing anaesthesia-related fatalities, in the performance of a liver surgery at the Harvard University when something went wrong but the patient was saved.

As far as the quality of health care at AIIMS-M is concerned, Dr. Ravi Kumar said he formed a patient safety group there for adopting best practices before the likely launch of in-patient services by the end of 2020. He was roping in some of the world’s best medical institutions like Mount Sinai and UT Southwestern Medical Centres and has already tied up academic and research collaboration with the IIT-Madras.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2jp33t/article30662945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VJPAGE3AIIMS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a-healthy-campaign-to-reduce-mortality/article30662946.ece

“Farmers can expect to see Krishna water quenching their parched lands during the coming kharif season,” said District Collector Pola Bhaskar after taking stock of the situation.

Nallamala Sagar Reservoir, designed to draw Krishna water from the foreshore of Srisailam Reservoir, has already come to fruition with the filling of Sunkesula, Gottipadia and Kakarla gaps.

114,2020/01/27,Decision on abolition of Council today: Minister,"Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana has said that the government would come out with a clear decision on the abolition of the Legislative Council on January 27.

Addressing mediapersons at the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) central office on Sunday, Mr. Satyanarayana said people should think whether the Council was necessary, alleging that it had flouted norms in dealing with the government business, for political reasons. This was what had happened to the decentralisation and CRDA repeal Bills in the Council after the Assembly had sent them as per established procedures, he added.

He recalled that N.T. Rama Rao had abolished the Council when he was the Chief Minister and the same media which had supported it then was now raising a hue and cry as the State government wanted to do the same thing to ensure that the Upper House did not come in the way of important Bills related to development and welfare.

The claims that the YSRCP was trying to win the support of TDP MLCs through dubious means were baseless, the Minister added.

‘Only advisory role’

At a separate press meet, government advisor (public affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy felt the need for discussing the relevance of the Council in view of the ‘undemocratic stand taken by it’ on the decentralisation and CRDA repeal Bills passed by the Assembly. He asserted that the Council was only advisory in nature and it should have adhered to rules.

He alleged that former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had provoked his party MLCs to stall the government business (Bills) to achieve his political objectives. The reference of the two Bills to a select committee by the Council Chairman was not in accordance with the rules. The Bills could only be delayed but not stopped altogether, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/decision-on-abolition-of-council-today-minister/article30660644.ece
115,2020/01/27,APS gearing up to intensify agitation,"Even as the Jagan Mohan Reddy government is mulling options to steer clear of all obstructions to implement its proposed shifting of the capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam, members of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (APS), spearheading a prolonged protest by farmers of the capital region, are gearing up to intensify their agitation.

The farmers’ protest entered the 40th day on Sunday.

On the sidelines of a ‘yagam’ being performed at Uddandarayapalem, samithi convener Sudhakar said that despite protests by people of all sections in the State and many farmers sacrificing their lives for the cause, the government was in a hurry to shift the capital.

“We will not allow this to happen and we are confident that the court will take cognisance of the farmers’ woes,” he said.

The High Court on Thursday ordered the government not to shift any government office out of Amaravati until further orders.

The invocation of Rule 71 in the Legislative Council by Leader of the Opposition Yanamala Ramakrishnudu had given the much-need breather to the Opposition TDP to plan its future course of action.

Divergent views

The development also caused a divide among the samithi members.

A few active members are of the view that the protest should be temporarily stopped in order to save the energy till the movement is taken to its logical conclusion.

“There is no question of any break at this point. We cannot allow this movement to get diluted at any cost. It’s a do-or-die battle for the farmers who are out on the road, seeking a fair deal from the government,” said Karthik Tummala, State coordinator of the samithi.

He said the protesters were not on the road for the last two days because they were denied permission by the authorities on account of the Republic Day celebrations.

The samithi members said they would use this time to fan out across the 13 districts and educate the people on the bane of shifting the capital out of Amaravati.

Dr. Karthik, who is also secretary of the Indian Medical Association, said they would explain the people what kind of development had already happened in the Amaravati region, and what more could be done within the available budget.

‘Constitutional calamity’

Senior advocate Jandhyala Ravishankar said that the government had led the State into a “constitutional calamity.”

Referring to the proposal to scrap the Legislative Council, he reminds of Article 169 of the Constitution that deals with creation and abolition of the Council.

“There’s a detailed process involved in it. One cannot have the Council abolished simply because it has not passed a Bill you want it to,” he said, adding that the government would witness many writs filed against its decision in the days to come.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aps-gearing-up-to-intensify-agitation/article30660622.ece

Addressing the 71st Republic Day celebrations, the first after the YSR Congress Party came to power in the State, at the IGMC stadium here on Sunday, Mr. Harichandan laid emphasis on the government’s three capitals plan.

“Emphasising on equitable distribution of resources and balanced development of all regions, the State Cabinet has taken a historic decision to distribute and decentralise the capital functions of the State,” the Governor said.

The Governor spoke at length about the government’s flagship Navaratnalu schemes that were aimed at benefiting all sections of people.

In this context, he referred to the schemes such as Rythu Bharosa, Jalayagnam, Amma Vodi, English medium in all State-run schools, implementation of prohibition in phased manner, and the village secretariat system.

Referring to the housing scheme, which was another flagship programme of the government, the Governor said, “The government will distribute house sites pattas to 25 lakh families. They will be registered in the name of women.”

“Merger of APSRTC with the government, launching of Kadapa Steel Plant, new sand policy, and Bill ensuring 75% reservation to locals in employment are the other steps taken by the government to ensure welfare of all sections of people,” he said.

Mr. Harichandan also mentioned about the Disha Bill that was passed in the Assembly recently with an aim to check crime against girls and women.

Referring to the Polavaram project, the Governor said that it would be completed by 2021.

Interestingly, the Governor did not mention about the reverse tendering policy the government had adopted in the Irrigation and other departments, through which it was said to have saved a lot of money. There was also no mention about the inter-linking of rivers.

117,2020/01/27,Freedom fighter bats for centralised capital,"Nonagenarian freedom fighter G. Vandanam has opined that the truncated Andhra Pradesh needs a centralised capital.

Talking to The Hindu during the Republic Day celebrations here on Sunday, Mr. Vandanam said, “What we need is focused development. The State with scarce resources after bifurcation can ill-afford to have multiple capitals as it struggles to cope with the bifurcation blues.”

“The available resources should be spent on developing a single centralised capital at a place that is almost equidistant from every corner of the State,” said Mr. Vandanam, who is one of the very few surviving freedom fighters in Prakasam district.

The essential characteristic of parliamentary democracy was fusion of the executive and the legislature, he said.

Plight of farmers

“The idea of decentralised capitals is not in the larger interests of the State,” he said, arguing that it was not correct to conclude that decentralised capitals would pave the way for decentralised development.

“It is a pity that the farmers who had parted with their land for the capital are now left in the lurch,” he observed.

“The fruits of development have not trickled down to the downtrodden sections of people even after seven decades of Independence,” he lamented.

Endorsing his views, Tanguturi Gopalakrishna, grandson of freedom fighter and first Chief Minister of Andhra State Prakasam Pantulu, said, “Visakhapatanam, at one far end of the State, is not accessible to people from most parts of the State.”

The capital should be developed in the region where large tracts of government land was available, he said, and demanded that justice be done to the farmers who had parted with their land for the capital.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/m7lw9e/article30660563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VJPG4-VANDANAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/freedom-fighter-bats-for-centralised-capital/article30660564.ece

Mr. Harichandan also took stock of the situation from the government, and is likely to submit a report to the Centre on the situation arising out of the government’s decision on decentralisation of capital.

The Governor enquired with Mr. Seetharam about the Bills passed in the Assembly on decentralisation and repeal of the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA).

The Speaker apprised Mr. Harichandan about the legislative business on the cards.

Mr. Shariff is understood to have explained about the two Bills which came to the Council from the Assembly and their reference to a select committee.

Report to Centre

Mr. Harichandan also summoned Chief Minister’s Principal Secretary Praveen Prakash and asked about the developments from the government side.

119,2020/01/27,Cabinet likely to take a decision on abolition of Council,"The Cabinet meeting, scheduled for Monday, is likely to take a decision on abolishing the Legislative Council. The government may table a resolution in the Assembly to this effect after a short discussion on the developments that followed the passage of the decentralisation and repeal of CRDA Bills in the House. The Legislative Council’s decision to refer them to a select committee kicked up a controversy.

The ruling YSR Congress Party is, sources say, is seriously contemplating abolishing the Council in the wake of the recent developments. The government would first initiate a discussion on the subject before tabling the resolution. Parliament would have to approve the resolution passed in the Assembly and abolish the Council. “ I don’t see any hurdle in getting it cleared in Parliament. It is a matter of days,” said a senior leader.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, on Thursday, had dropped hints that the Council would be abolished. “We need to seriously think whether we need to have such a House which appears to be functioning with only political motives,” he had said in the Assembly. He further said it was not mandatory to have the Council. “So let us discuss the issue further on Monday and take a decision on whether or not to continue the Council,” he had said.

Meanwhile, the Telugu Desam Party decided to stay away from the Assembly proceedings. The legislature party meeting chaired by national president N. Chandrababu Naidu felt that it was unconstitutional to discuss the proceedings in the Legislative Council, in the Assembly. Hence, the Opposition party decided not to attend the proceedings.

Mr. Naidu said the party would recognise the services of leaders, who stand by it during difficult times. “Don’t get carried away by the allurements by the ruling party,” he reportedly told his party colleagues.

Later, talking to reporters, TDP MLC Batchula Arjunudu said the government had decided to abolish the Council as the TDP did not dance to the tune so the ruling party. The YSR Congress Party was going against public opinion. It had no respect for the law and the Constitution, he alleged.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cabinet-likely-to-take-a-decision-on-abolition-of-council/article30660452.ece
120,2020/01/27,A small stretch of road turns into a ‘healthcare hub’,"The setting up of many public healthcare institutions on one particular stretch of the busy KRS Road here has turned the area into a potential hub for all major healthcare services and has scope for developing more facilities for patients’ ease.

Health Minister B. Sriramulu, who was in Mysuru recently, was perhaps hinting at these hospitals – some have become functional and a few are in the process of becoming operational – when he announced to make Mysuru a “healthcare hub.”

Eight major hospitals are located on the stretch between Vontikoppal Temple junction and Outer Ring Road (ORR) junction on KRS Road in a distance of less than five km.

They include the 350-bed Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, the 100-bed renovated ESI Hospital, the Government Nature Cure and Yoga Medical College, the Epidemic Diseases (ED) Hospital and the PKTB Sanatorium (both are old institutions), the 100-bed Trauma Care Centre, the 300-bed District Hospital (which was opened on Thursday) and the under-construction 250-bed Super Speciality Hospital.

“It’s not common to find so many public healthcare facilities located within a short distance on one particular stretch of road. If more facilities are brought in, making it a healthcare hub, it will largely benefit patients since services for primary care, secondary care, tertiary care, super speciality care and cardiac care are available within easily reachable distance,” said District Health Officer Venkatesh.

Sources in the health sector said facilities such as Sri Jayadeva Institute, which provides advanced cardiac care, have the potential to make the area a “medical tourism hub”.

Land availability

The PKTB Sanatorium has plenty of land under the control of the Medical Education Department and, therefore, some of the healthcare projects are located there since land is not ava

ilable within the city limits. More land is available for accommodating any new health project.

With the launch of new hospitals, the stretch has turned busy and the road connecting these facilities had been developed with ample lighting.

The super speciality hospital was earlier proposed on the premises of 1,000-bed K.R. Hospital but was later shifted to the Sanatorium campus after the district hospital was also identified nearby.

The K.R. Hospital, located in the city centre, offers basic public healthcare with over a dozen speciality services such as nephrology, neurology, urology and neurosurgery.

Healthcare services for factory workers and others have improved with the launch of the renovated 100-bed Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Hospital.

The modernised ESI Hospital provides in-patient and outpatient treatment facilities in many specialities. Insured persons hailing from six districts — Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan, Kodagu, and Chikkamagaluru — are using the services. Mysuru district alone has about 1.7 lakh insured persons. Earlier, the hospital existed on 3.48 acres of land.

New building

The old building was demolished and a new, improved one had been built in its place. ESI Hospital is close to the Metagalli and Hebbal industrial areas where many factories and industrial units are located.

On an average, 3,000 people use outpatient care at K.R. Hospital daily. Patients from neighbouring districts also come over, increasing the load on the existing infrastructure.

122,2020/01/27,Farmers launch indefinite dharna seeking MSP,"Farmers on Monday launched an indefinite dharna under the aegis of the Karnataka Raita Sena demanding minimum support price (MSP) for crops here.

In Dharwad, sena head Viresh Sobaradmath is leading the agitation in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office. A similar protest would be subsequently held in front of all the district administration offices across the State, the protesters said.

Mr. Sobaradmath said that both the Union and State governments have remained indifferent to the plight of the farmers in the State, particularly those in North Karnataka.

The farmers condition is deplorable due to natural vagaries. After a series of drought for four years, flash floods last year created havoc in North Karnataka. The hopes of farmers who invested in their fields borrowing loans from banks and private moneylenders have been washed away in the floods. The condition of farmers is highly sensitive and if it is not solved, it will spell doom for the agriculture sector in the State, he said.

Overcoming all odds of nature, some farmers have grown crops but again unscientific pricing by traders and dalals in the APMCs has hit them hard. As a majority of gram panchayats do not have scientific foodgrains-storing godowns, the farmers are forced to sell their produce early. Encashing on this, the traders in the APMCs have been duping the farmers by quoting poor prices for their crops.

Due to this, the farmers are unable to get even the invested amount and are left in the lurch, he said.

Mr. Sobaradmath demanded that the government take steps and announce minimum support price for crops to protect farmers from the clutches of traders and merchants. The Centre has announced minimum support price for six crops — green gram ₹ 6,975, cotton ₹ 5,450, black gram ₹ 5,600, maize ₹ 1,700, wheat ₹ 1,840 and Bengal gram ₹ 4,620. However, this cannot be considered scientific because farmers have invested more money to raise these crops. Therefore, the State government should announce additional support price over the minimum support price announced by the Union government, he said.

The minimum support price for green gram should be fixed at ₹ 9,975 per quintal, ₹ 7,450 per quintal for cotton, ₹ 8,600 per quintal for black gram, ₹ 2,700 per quintal for maize, ₹ 2,800 per quintal for wheat and ₹ 7,620 per quintal for Bengal gram. The minimum support price should be ₹ 3,570 per quintal for jowar, ₹ 7,650 for sunflower and ₹ 8,000 for safflower seeds, he added.

He further said that the officials are hand-in-glove with traders and the procurement centres are opened only after farmers sell their crops. Therefore, the government should take steps to open procurement centres well in advance in the taluk and hobli level, Mr. Sobaradmath said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jkisbc/article30668465.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28HBDHARWADFARMERS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmers-launch-indefinite-dharna-seeking-msp/article30668466.ece
123,2020/01/27,Yediyurappa promises all aid for rebuilding flood-hit Kodagu,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced in Madikeri on Monday that his government was ready to provide all for rebuilding Kodagu which was battered by back-to-back floods and landslides in 2018 and 2019. “I want to see Kodagu, which is described as Kashmir of the South, to return to its lost glory, giving boost to tourism development,” he said.

Speaking after laying the foundation stone for 450-bed hospital block of Kodagu Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) here, he said 250 houses had been constructed for the flood victims of 2018 and some of them have been distributed to them. Infosys Foundation had been constructing 200 houses for the displaced persons. In 2019, as many as 2,333 houses had been destroyed in the calamity and ₹12.30 crore had been released for the construction of houses for the flood victims.

Mr. Yediyurappa said the State government has released ₹100 crore for the flood relief works and a grant of ₹10 crore had been sanctioned as per the NDRF norms.

He said his government has accorded priority for health, education and agriculture. Government hospitals will be improved as poor patients are largely dependent on them for healthcare. “The infrastructural needs of the health sector will be met.”

Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Medical Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan, Minister in-charge of Kodagu district V. Somanna, Appachu Ranjan and K.G. Bopaiah, MLAs, and Pratap Simha, MP,were present.

Later, Mr. Appachu Ranjan presented a memorandum to the Chief Minister with a list of demands in view of the damage Kodagu had suffered. He urged Mr. Yediyurappa to give special attention for bringing the district back to its original glory, providing all necessary assistance.

In the memorandum, Mr. Ranjan sought an assistance of ₹130 crore for clearing silt built up in Harangi backwaters, Hattihole in Madapura, and the Cauvery river as he blamed silt for floods in areas close to places including Kushalnagar. In the budget, Mr .Yediyurappa had set aside ₹1 crore for the work but the department concerned has put the estimate at ₹130 crore.

The budget allocation for the work had not been released even today. Floods are happening even if there was moderate rainfall in the area, as seen in Kushalnagar town in 2018 and 2019. “As there is threat of floods in the coming monsoon, the funds should be released on priority,” he said.

The MLA also urged the Chief Minister to direct the officials to implement his order on providing free power to farmers’ pumpsets (up to 10 HP) in the district.

Mr .Yediyurappa promised to positively look into the MLA’s demands on returning to Bengaluru.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappa-promises-all-aid-for-rebuilding-flood-hit-kodagu/article30666401.ece
124,2020/01/27,Clearance for Vijayapura airport project soon: Karjol,"Minister for Public Works and Social Welfare Govind Karjol has said that the airport project for Vijayapura will get clearance in the next budget.

With regard to appointment of Assistant Engineers and Junior Engineers, he said that the government has decided to appoint 925 posts through KPSC. “Since the government has received complaints that appointment of officials through PWD was leading to corruption, we decided to get these appointments through KPSC for maintaining transparency.”

Admitting that some people have gone to court against this order, Mr. Karjol however claimed that the stay would soon be vacated and appointment process would be completed.

With regard to filling up of backlog posts, the Minister said that within three months, some 2,508 backlog posts vacant in different departments would be filled up.

About the Social Welfare Department, he said that a significant change has been made in ‘Airawata’ scheme in which a taxi is given to people of SC/ST community under subsidy for self-employment. “Now, the government has decided to give permission to buy either SUV (like Tempo Trax, a 10-seater vehicle) or mini-goods vehicle. No permission will be given for taxis”, he said. Mentioning the reason, Mr. Karjol said that taxis are not giving adequate earnings to the beneficiaries, which is defeating the very objective of giving subsidy.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/umrkr8/article30666017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VIJAYAPURAKARJOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/clearance-for-vijayapura-airport-project-soon-karjol/article30665521.ece

Referring to Mahatma Gandhi’s book, India of my dreams, Mr. Patil said that in the book, Mahatma Gandhi mentions that while the poor have a voice to raise in India, it has no place for divisions such as upper or lower caste as it the nation for the people that gives equality.

“Mahatma Gandhi dreamed of such a nation that preaches, propagates and follows the rules of equality in all spheres and is without any gender bias,” he said.

He stated that a healthy democracy gives more importance to tolerance and shows respect to all citizens rather than speaking of mere geographical unity.

Not disputing the fact that the Constitution gives several rights to citizens, Mr. Patil, however, added that people should also know that they have responsibilities, along with rights, to their nation which would make a person a better citizen.

134,2020/01/27,Land acquisition will cause biggest jump in Yettinahole project bill,"The State’s ambitious Yettinahole drinking water project is staring at its cost more than doubling — from about ₹13,000 crore when originally planned to ₹25,000 crore now. While the steepest hike has come in the cost of land acquisition, other factors include Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the cost of canal work and roadwork.

The cost of land acquisition has jumped from about ₹460 crore to ₹4,105 crore. While the government estimated the acquisition cost at ₹4 lakh per acre acquired for construction of gravity canal, reservoir and lift area, the revised Land Acquisition Act of 2014 made the compensation payable four times the market value, drastically altering the scheme of things.

About 12,000 acres in Hassan and Tumakuru districts is to be acquired for the 248-km stretch of gravity canal. A top Irrigation Department official said, “The land acquisition cost, which was 150% to 200% of the land value, has shot up to about 400%. The cost of acquiring land for the reservoir at Koratagere is also to go up.”

Pipes add up

If the initial plan for the canal and feeder was to be open, it was decided to have pipes. Also, as the project gained pace, feeders to new areas in Ramanagaram and Bengaluru Rural were added. The net result is the escalation of cost of canal work from ₹4,514 crore to ₹7,981 crore. The feeder cost has gone up from ₹1,910 crore to ₹6,551 crore.

This apart, the introduction of GST midway through the project in 2017 has added ₹466 crore to the project (at a rate of 12%). This cost was not envisioned when the project was approved. Adding another ₹450 crore is the plan to develop roads.

Sources in the Irrigation Department said they were now calculating the precise escalation of project cost and a report would be submitted to the government in about two weeks. While the project, when launched, had a completion deadline of June 2020, it is running behind schedule.

“Even if the land acquisition is completed now, it could take about two years to complete the project. But the acquisition issue has left the completion date hanging,” a source said, adding that to reduce further escalation of costs the government needed to quickly resolve the land acquisition issue at Byramangala village in Koratagere. “For an ongoing work, cost escalation has been worked out to be 3-4%. The problem could be for works that are yet to start, where the escalation of cost could be as much as 10%.”

Defending the escalation, a senior irrigation official said that such escalations were common for a large project. “All works are not tendered together, but are taken up in phases. Rising acquisition cost was not foreseen. Even with all this, the pace of the project is quite good. Many projects like Upper Bhadra are languishing for decades.”

Water to rivers

Not waiting for the project to be completed, the Irrigation Department now plans to pump water from Yettinahole from this monsoon.

“The lift component part, including the pumps and power house, is ready. We want to take up a trial of lifting water from Yettinahole this monsoon and letting it [flow] to Hemavati reservoir at Gorur in Hassan from near Sakleshpur,” an official source said. In about eight months, when the gravity canal is ready till near Arsikere area, water will be pumped into Vedavati river, a tributary of the Tungabhadra, which will flow into Vani Vilas Sagar reservoir in Hiriyur taluk of Chitradurga district.

Compensating farmers

The delay in the State government’s decision on compensating the farmers of Koratagere, where a reservoir is planned at Bhairagondlu, remains a concern for concern for officials. For, by delaying approval of an additional burden of ₹300 crore, which will be the cost of meeting the demand of farmers in Koratagere, the State could be staring at an annual escalation of about ₹600 crore, an official said.

“Though a decision to compensate the Koratagere farmers on a par with [those of] Doddaballapur will be a departure from the provisions of the law, it could be done as it is a drinking water project. The file is in the Chief Minister’s Office,” the official said.

While farmers in Doddaballapur are getting a compensation of ₹32 lakh an acre, the farmers of Koratagere are getting ₹8 lakh an acre, as the guidance values are ₹8 lakh and ₹2 lakh an acre, respectively.

However, another senior irrigation official said the government was worried that giving special treatment to farmers in Koratagere could lead to similar demands from farmers elsewhere. “Already, the Almatti project is affected as compensation for submergence of land if the height increases from 521 feet to 524 feet is to be about ₹40,000 crore,” the official said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/16h8p6/article30660393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGYETTINAHOLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/land-acquisition-will-cause-biggest-jump-in-yettinahole-project-bill/article30660360.ece
135,2020/01/27,"Can’t remove SC, ST midday meal workers based on caste: DPI tells schools","Coming down heavily on school managements discriminating against midday meal workers belonging to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities, the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) has warned of action if any school is found to be removing such workers without reason.

In a circular issued last week, the department stated that if SC/ST midday meal workers are removed from work, the Deputy Directors of Public Instruction (DDPI) need to verify the matter and ensure that they are reinstated if the reason for termination of service is not found to be valid. If the DDPI finds the reason valid, another worker belonging to the same category has to be appointed in their place.

The department has also categorically said that midday meal workers should be used only to cook noon meals and not to prepare meals for private functions, including those held by teachers.

These instructions have been issued after a section of midday meal workers carried out a strike last week, affecting the supply of midday meals at some schools for a day. The workers also brought it to the department’s notice that they were being exploited and their husbands were being asked to work as watchmen at schools late at night. The department, in the new guidelines, has prohibited this.

Matters of quality regarding midday meals have also been raised, with the department saying that if any of the ingredients were spoilt, they should be discarded and fresh provisions used. The provisions should be allotted to midday meal workers and helpers based on the attendance of students. The department has also noted that some heads of schools were directing workers to clean and use spoilt provisions. A strict direction has been issued stating that if the health of any of student is affected because of this, action will be initiated against the officials concerned. The guidelines also order the formation of a committee to which the workers can report cases of physical and mental harassment.

H.K. Ramachandrappa, honorary president, Karnataka State Midday Meal Workers Federation, welcomed the move to inquire into reasons for removal of workers. He said there was a need for due diligence in carrying out such investigations.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cant-remove-sc-st-midday-meal-workers-based-on-caste-dpi-tells-schools/article30660326.ece
136,2020/01/27,Padma reward for Karnataka couple’s untiring effort,"A late-evening phone call from the Ministry of Home Affairs on Saturday left K.V. Sampath Kumar and his wife Vidushi K.S. Jayalakshmi perplexed. Apart from saying a terse “congratulations”, the caller asked the couple to immediately send by email their full names in English and Hindi. When Mr. Kumar ventured to ask the reason for it, the caller merely said it was confidential. “You will know soon,” he said, before hanging up.

Another call a few hours later — around 8 p.m. — left the couple in a state of shock. “We received the news of being selected for the Padma Shri,” said Mr. Kumar, who along with his wife multitasks as editor, publisher, proofreader and reporter of India’s, and perhaps the world’s, only Sanskrit newspaper, Sudharma.

“We were stunned for a while as the news left us wondering whether we had done anything of significance to merit a national award,” said Mr. Kumar, amid taking phone calls to thank his readers and well-wishers, who kept calling him throughout the day with congratulations. “I did not know that my name had been proposed. I salute the person who suggested my name along with that of my wife and dedicate this award to the memory of my late father, who started this venture.”

The award and national recognition could not have come at a more appropriate time, as the Sanskrit daily — which has a circulation of nearly 3,500 — is set to celebrate its golden jubilee next month. Launched in 1970 by Mr. Kumar’s father, Pandit K.N. Varadaraja Iyengar, it was an enterprise with a difference — not for profit, but to disseminate news in Sanskrit to keep the “language of the gods” alive and conserve a slice of Indian culture while dispelling the notion that Sanskrit was “dead” or “only for vidwans”. Though a lot of students study Sanskrit in schools even today, it is more because of the perception that it is a “scoring subject”, said Mr. Kumar.

Initially, people were sceptical about the paper’s viability, but Iyengar, with his zest for news and Sanskrit, kept the enterprise alive and extracted a promise from his son and daughter-in-law to keep Sudharma alive.

Today, the paper has about 3,500 subscribers for the print version and is despatched to readers across India by post. The paper has also kept pace with the changing times and launched an online version, which is available to subscribers for a fee of ₹500.

But, as Mr. Kumar and Ms. Vijayalakshmi pointed out, the future is bleak, given the spiralling costs of printing and distribution. In fact, it has brought the couple to a state of near bankruptcy. To tide over the difficulties, they have published calendars in Sanskrit to generate additional funds. With hardly any advertisement support from the government or from private entrepreneurs, Sudharma is dependent on subscription fee and donations. “It will be easy to shut down the publication, but the challenge to keep it alive. We are committed to taking it forward,” Ms. Vijayalakshmi said.

The couple are bracing for the golden jubilee celebrations of Sudharma, which will be held in the city on February 29 and March 1.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/r0a5gl/article30660322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGMYSPADMASHRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/padma-reward-for-karnataka-couples-untiring-effort/article30660323.ece
137,2020/01/27,"‘Transition’ is ready for ₹10,000","At a time when the huge budgets of some films are highlighted as part of their promotion, a young film crew is showing the way with their frugal filmmaking techniques. The crew, all below the age of 21, have managed to complete a full-length feature film, titled ‘Transition’, at ₹10,000. The film is the result of a collective effort of a group of youth who took time out from their busy schedules to complete the film.

Krishnanunni Mangalath, the film’s director, who has also done the cinematography, editing and some of the other post-production work, says that the film would not have happened if not for the group of friends.

“We made our first short film as soon as we completed Class 10. Since then, we have worked in 15 short films, out of which I directed four. For quite some time, we have been thinking of taking this to the next level and making a full-length feature film. We did not set out to make a film at ₹10,000. It is just that we somehow ended up making the film at that cost, due to our methods,” says Krishnanunni.

A joint effort

The film was shot in an old Canon 7D camera, which he borrowed from a friend’s father. The few slow-motion shots were taken on a mobile camera. The sounds and music work were done by two of his friends for free. The post-production work was done in Krishnanunni’s laptop using a basic editing software. Much of the expense, he says, was spent in travelling.

Experimental film

“Part of the film is set in Madurai, as we are showing that the protagonist is coming from Madurai to Thiruvananthapuram with a specific purpose. The film is structured as a series of conversations between him and a few of the people he meet here. It is an experimental film. We are planning to send it to a few film festivals,” says Krishanunni.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/afun0c/article30669310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvsrp,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/transition-is-ready-for-10000/article30669311.ece
138,2020/01/27,Talks to solve dispute over Shane Nigam fail,"The Association of Malayalam Movie Artistes (AMMA) has rejected a demand by the Kerala Film Producers Association that actor Shane Nigam should pay a compensation of ₹1 crore. The demand for the compensation was raised during a meeting between the two film industry unions here on Monday, said AMMA general secretary Edavela Babu.

He said there was no reason at all for the actor to pay the compensation. In fact, AMMA representatives said at the meeting that Shane should be given remuneration only after completing the project. “But we cannot agree to their latest demand”. Further decision on the issue would be taken at the executive committee meeting of AMMA, he added.

The artistes’ union felt there was an agreement that the issues would be addressed after Shane completed the dubbing of a stalled film. However, asking for monetary compensation after the dubbing was completed was not fair.

The quarrel between Shane Nigam and the Kerala Film Producers Association had started after the former alleged that he had received death threats from Joby George, producer of his movie Veyil, for changing his hairstyle for the movie Qurbani.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/talks-to-solve-dispute-over-shane-nigam-fail/article30669290.ece
139,2020/01/27,Minorities’ turnout in human chain bothers UDF,"The enthusiastic minority participation in the human chain formed across the State at the behest of the Left Democratic Front against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on Sunday has caused much discomfort in the United Democratic Front that is yet to crystallise a strategy for winning the confidence of such sections.

Legions of members of the Muslim community that thronged the protest venues in the Malabar region, mainly the stronghold of the Indian Union Muslim League, and the conspicuous presence of the Christian community, including nuns in the Congress bastions, rendered a jolt to the UDF.

But for stray efforts, mostly at the initiative of allies like the IUML and individual leaders, the front has still not been able to launch a solid movement against the CAA. In contrast, LDF had first launched a joint programme with the Opposition and then organised pan Kerala protests for which it extended an invitation to the UDF too.

LDF’s tactic

While the UDF resolved against holding hands with its political foes, the LDF made considerable headway with its workers conducting door-to-door campaigns and addressing family gatherings to mobilise support for the chain.

The outcome was quite evident in the huge turnout all over the State, especially in those districts in Malabar, where the minority communities are a force to reckon with.

The LDF had declared that all those who share an angst about the political developments in the country since the notification of the Act could join the human chain as a mass movement and it need not be construed as a political formation with an eye on the elections. Thus stance gave confidence to those sections that had developed a cold feet to become part of the chain.

Though IUML and Congress leaders chose to brush aside minorities’ participation as a normal response to an action which upheld their cause, it is likely to have more serious ramifications for the UDF.

The LDF has succeeded to a considerable extent in capturing the ground that the UDF ceded for want of a clear strategy and regaining it would not be easy either.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pcjwhl/article30669272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TVPAGE4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/minorities-turnout-in-human-chain-bothers-udf/article30669273.ece

Both departments have agreed to employ the PRICE (project information and cost estimation) software, which they use for preparing project estimates and issuing online approvals, for the purpose. The National Informatics Centre (NIC) has been assigned the job of integrating KWA and PWD offices in all 14 districts online, a KWA official said.

Govt. sets up panel

The State government has also set up a panel headed by B. Ashok, Secretary, Water Resources, for preparing the road map and action plan for the project.

Moving to the online platform is expected to avert blame games and speed up permits for ‘road cutting’ work. Now, this is a time-consuming process. Under the new system, KWA and PWD officers will undertake site inspections jointly and paperwork will migrate online, which will speed things up, a KWA official said.

This is also the latest in a series of measures adopted by the KWA to avoid disputes with the PWD over road-cutting.

Following incidents where KWA officials were summoned to police stations over disputes, the KWA had asked its officers to strictly adhere to norms when carrying out leak-rectification work.

144,2020/01/27,KMRL probing ways to mop up additional revenue to tide over loss,"The spiralling of Kochi Metro’s net loss from ₹167 crore in 2017-18 to ₹281 crore in 2018-19 has set officials of Kochi Metro Rail Limited scouting for avenues to increase non-fare-box collection.

According to metro sources, the 32% increase in daily passenger patronage in 2019 as compared to 2018, thanks to the opening of the 5.5-km-long Maharaja’s College-Thykoodam extension, is in itself a sign that ridership and subsequently income would increase with every extension. The over 1-km-long extension to Pettah and the metro’s further 1.50-km extension to S.N. Junction in Thripunithura will further increase the footfall.

The Thykoodam extension resulted in average daily ridership touching 68,000, with weekends witnessing 72,000 commuters relying on the metro. It crossed the 1-lakh mark twice, including the Christmas-New Year season. But the ridership was well short of the 2.75-lakh mentioned in the metro’s detailed project report. The ridership in 2019 was 88,83,184 till September 3. It was 77,14,836 from September 4 to December 30.

“The increase in the number of commuters has resulted in the metro achieving operational profit. Still, the 23.5-km-long metro is incurring approximately ₹10 lakh net loss per day. The loss was about ₹20 lakh in 2017, when the 12-km Aluva-Palarivattom stretch was commissioned. It is here that non-fare-box revenue or non-ticketing revenue gains relevance,” metro sources said.

KMRL Managing Director Alkesh Kumar Sharma said additional revenue was important since the repayment of loan availed in 2015 from French lending agency AFD and banks has begun. “Moreover, operational expenses would increase due to depreciation of capital – as in increased expenses to maintain metro trains, civil structures and the like. Keeping this in mind, we have intensified the hunt to monetise land. An entertainment hub titled Bliss City is expected to come up in Kakkanad.”

Already, Kochi metro’s non-fare-box revenue from the sale of advertisement space and commercial space within stations constitute around 40% of its total income. This is one of the highest among metros in the country, said Mr. Sharma.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kmrl-probing-ways-to-mop-up-alternative-revenue-to-tide-over-loss/article30669099.ece
145,2020/01/27,Bypass project: girder placed on ROB,"In a major step towards the completion of the much delayed Alappuzha bypass project, the installation of girders as part of the construction of a rail overbridge (ROB) at Malikamukku has begun.

The Alappuzha bypass project consists of two RoBs at Malikamukku and Kuthirapanthy.

Officials said that the first girder had been fixed at Malikamukku in the early hours of Monday in the presence of officials with the railway and National Highways Authority of India. Rest four girders will be installed in the coming days. For carrying out the work, the Railways has announced regulation of train services for two hours on the coastal route till January 30.

Earlier, the bypass project had come to a halt after a delay in getting permission from Railways to place girders above the railway track. After inspecting the girders brought for the construction of the RoBs, Railways recommended structural changes and denied permission for starting the work.

After several months of delay, necessary changes have been made in the girders as per the direction of the railway authorities. The authorities later conducted a second inspection of the girders and submitted a report to the Chief Bridge Engineer. The nod to place the girders was received earlier this month.

Officials said that necessary changes were being made on five girders of the second RoB at Kuthirapanthy. The girders will be provided to railway authorities for inspection after modifications, officials added.

Meanwhile, Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran has directed authorities to complete the bypass project by April 30.

The Alappuzha bypass project was first mooted four decades ago. However, it had remained on paper until the work got under way on April 10, 2015. The project, which was set to be completed in September 2017 got delayed on account of various reasons. The deadline was initially extended to May 28, 2018 and further to August 31, 2018.

Almost complete

According to officials, the majority of the project has been completed, but the bypass can only be opened to traffic after the completion of two RoBs.

The 6.8-km two-lane bypass road will link Kommady on the north and Kalarcode on the south and pass by the western side of National Highway 66.

The project is being implemented at a cost of ₹348.43 crore with equal shares borne by the Union and the State governments.

147,2020/01/27,"A funny, yet deep take on death industry","At a time when dying is really expensive, Scott Tumbull, a former funeral director, and artiste Lara Thoms talk about the business of death, in a surprisingly casual and pleasant way.

The Director, a play by APHIDS Group from Australia staged at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala on Monday, is a performance that demystifies and exposes the layers of the death industry in a satirical manner.

The one-hour performance balances macabre reality, playfulness and the tragic elements of death. It never slipped, not even for a second, to the shade of grief and despair.

From his long association with the death industry, Tumbull digs a little deeper on what happens after we go. While discussing this taboo but universal topic, they do not leave any detailing, including the smell of a crematorium, the tools of the mortuary, music of funeral, flowers or driving tractors into a funeral chapel.

Lucrative business

When death brings grief for somebody, it is a lucrative business for some others. There are various levels of bargaining, quality checks, and value-added services.

As the funeral director and theatre director, Turnbull and Thoms ask each other to perform their tasks, share knowledge and give feedback on each other’s actions. The artistes involve in meaningful exchange with audiences through performance and critical dialogue.

Lara Thoms, a queer artiste, is the director of the play. “The Director questions the Western death industry that does not offer many options to grieving families. It is an industry that encourages outsourcing all aspects of death care at great expense,” says Lara Thoms. “Scott and I met in 2016, and he was a rare find when it comes to the funeral business — someone who was able to perform traditional, over-priced funerals for a multinational company alongside installing eclectic installations in his chapel or hand-making cat coffins. This dichotomy was fascinating to me. The Director is ultimately a conversation between two friends about something that is uncomfortable for Westerners to talk about,” says Lara Thoms.

Collaborative and future-focused, APHIDS is led by Eugenia Lim, Lara Thoms and Mish Grigor.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-funny-yet-deep-take-on-death-industry/article30669083.ece
148,2020/01/27,Steps to tackle water scarcity in Kottayam,"Amid reports about water-level in rivers and the ground becoming precarious, the authorities have embarked on a contingency plan to tackle the impending drought situation in Kottayam.

According to officials with the Irrigation Department, plans are afoot to construct five temporary bunds across the Meenachil River to prevent intrusion of saline water from Vembanad.

“The State government has accorded a financial sanction of ₹65 lakh for constructing the bunds, which will come up along the downstream on the western side of Kottayam Town,” said a senior official.

According to him, water-levels in Manimalayar and Meenachil rivers, two major drinking water sources in the district, have already hit the bottom.

“The river beds of these water bodies, which together feed most part of the district, had gone dry by the end of December itself. Taking a serious note of the situation, directions have been issued to complete the annual maintenance works of all regulators and check dams at the earliest so as to store maximum quantity of water at the intake points.” the official added.

Officials with the Ground Water Department said that the drop in river water levels also has a significant impact on the ground water in the region.

The District officer of the Ground Water Department has sought requirements of the various local bodies regarding the bore-wells, hand pumps and minor irrigation projects.

Further, directions have been issued to the Assistant Executive Engineers at Kottayam, Pala and Ponkunnam offices to ensure efficient distribution of drinking water in the coming summer.

The situation in the western parts including Kumarakom is not rosy either, where the access to clean drinking water has always been a problem.

150,2020/01/27,Space Park to ink 2 MoUs this week,"Space Park, being developed here by the State government with help from the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and industry, will ink two memorandum of understanding (MoU) later this week which will give it and academic institutions a global connect with the space industry.

A signing of MoU with the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), Colorado, and Space Generation Advisory Council (SGAC), Austria, is one of the highlights of a two-day international conclave on space technology planned by Space Park on Friday and Saturday at Kovalam.

Vehicle

The MoU with LASP will serve as a vehicle for connecting academic institutions in Kerala with LASP, Space Park special officer Santhosh Kurup told The Hindu.

LASP is a research institute established in 1948 at the University of Colorado Boulder, US. Its research areas include solar influences, atmospheric processes of earth and other planets and space weather. “The MoU will enable Space Park to connect organisations and academic institutions in the State such as universities and engineering colleges interested in science missions with LASP,” Mr. Kurup said.

SGAC in support of the UN Programme on space applications is one of the largest networks of young space enthusiasts and professionals.

On the one hand, the MoU will help Space Park establish a global presence by becoming a part of the SGAC community, Mr. Kurup said.

“At some point in the future, Space Park hopes to play the role of policy maker at the national level. SGAC’s inputs in policy decisions will be helpful,” he said.

On the other, it will help space enthusiasts in Kerala link up with the large community of space enthusiasts who are part of SGAC. A third MoU, with the Confederation of Indian Industry, also will be signed during the conclave. By developing the Space Park, the government intends to promote Thiruvananthapuram as the Space City of the country, IT Secretary M. Sivasankar said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/space-park-to-ink-2-mous-this-week/article30669065.ece
151,2020/01/27,Role of theatre in addressing issues of migrant people,"A seminar on ‘Theatre of Migration and Citizenship’ organised as part of the ITFoK discussed the insecurities and uncertainties faced by migrants and the role of theatre in addressing these issues.

Amitesh Grover, ITFoK festival director, moderated the session featuring Lars Oyno, Norwegian actor, director and playwright who helmed Grusomhetens Theater; Inua Ellams, Nigerian-born poet, playwright and performer; and Jacob Boehme, Melbourne- born theatre maker and choreographer. The common factor that connected them all was migration and citizenship-based issues they faced.

Contemporary topics

Artistes had to focus on contemporary topics and create political or revolutionary theatre. They should respond to corruption and other issues related to the State, said Oyno. “Theatres are always forced to entertain, so it must entertain; a theatre that does not entertain does not function. Also, a theatre must communicate with the audience. Artistes should find ways to communicate with all categories of audience. Artistes must take the risk of presenting the contemporary realities. Artiste should be bold,” he said.

Inua Ellams, creator of An Evening with Immigrant , who was born to a Muslim father and a Catholic mother, suffered a lot with the issues of migration. He shared the incidents of British colonisation of Africa and its effects on the northern and southern parts. As a result of colonisation, people lost their jobs, cattle and land, and were forced to move to different parts. Due to those experiences, the themes of his works mainly stuck to identity, displacement and destiny. Jacob Boehme, whose mother is a fifth-generation Australian and father a British, also shared his experiences on citizenship issues. He shared the problems faced by his grandmother, who was a black woman. She was given an exemption certificate, which she had to carry all the time and produce to the police whenever asked to.

153,2020/01/27,"Kerala CM writes to PM, seeks special flight to airlift Indians from Wuhan","Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take steps to operate a special flight to Wuhan or a nearby functional airport and airlift the Indian nationals stranded there in view of the worsening novel corona virus (nCova) infection in the Chinese province.

Expressing the concern of the State, the Chief Minister in a letter to the Prime Minister on Monday pointed out that information from the relatives of the students from Kerala studying in various universities in Wuhan showed that the situation was grave and that the Yichang area had also been affected.

Medical assistance

“It may be appropriate to consider operating a special flight to Wuhan or a nearby functional airport and airlift the Indian nationals stranded there and bring them back to India,” said Mr. Vijayan. The State was ready to offer the assistance of medical professionals in case the Indians being evacuated from Wuhan were to be medically attended to.

The Chief Minister pointed out in the letter that he had written to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on January 24 seeking a comprehensive assessment of the emerging situation and to provide necessary assistance to the people of Indian origin, most of whom were students of Wuhan University.

The Prime Minister has also been requested to give necessary instruction to the Indian Embassy in China to act pro-actively and provide necessary assistance and reassurance to Indians, including Keralites, stranded in Wuhan and Yichang.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jyon7w/article30290702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11PINARAYIVIJAYAN-13dec-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-seeks-special-flight-to-airlift-indians/article30669041.ece
154,2020/01/27,Coronavirus: 5 put in isolation wards in Kerala,"Even as the Health Department continues the surveillance, quarantine and observation of people in the State with a recent travel history to China, given the speed with which the 2019-nCoV (novel Coronavirus) has been spreading across the globe and the surprisingly high number of people coming into the State from China, one should naturally expect to find a positive case sooner or later, infectious diseases experts believe.

Till Monday, the Health Department has located 436 people in the State with a recent travel history to China. Five of them, with mild flu-like symptoms, have been put in isolation wards in hospitals as a matter of “abundant caution”. The rest (431) have been advised home quarantine for 28 days from the day of their departure from China.

Local health workers will be in touch with these persons for daily follow-up.

Advisories

The department has issued separate advisories for those on home quarantine as well as the general public. Any query should be addressed to the 24x7 helpline Disha (0471-2552056 / 1056).

Outbreak Monitoring Units (OMUs) were set up in all Medical Colleges in the State which had to maintain a high level of alert and monitor patients in emergency wing and OP clinics, triage them and isolate those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as they could be the “super-spreaders” in any infectious disease outbreaks.

“When the alert on nCoV came, all hospitals had already been revising and updating their emergency preparedness measures, infection control protocols and conducting mock drills to test the alertness of healthcare workers because after two consecutive years of dealing with Nipah, December-May is a period when the entire health system is put on Nipah-alert. OMUs in MCHs are all geared up to handle any health emergencies,” a senior Infectious Diseases expert at Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, said.

156,2020/01/27,CBI takes over probe into Kerala custodial death case,"The CBI has registered a case against seven policemen after it took over the probe into the alleged custodial torture, leading to the death, of a 49-year-old man, in Kerala’s Idukki in June last year.

Those named in the FIR are the then sub-inspector, Sabu K.A., assistant sub-inspectors Regimon C.B. and Roy P. Varghese, civil police officers Jithin K. George, Niyas S. and Sajeev Antony, and Home Guard James K.M. They were all posted at the Nedumkandam police station.

It is alleged that Rajkumar, facing charges of financial fraud, was picked up on the night of June 12, 2019, and subjected to third-degree torture during interrogation. The accused policemen claimed to have taken him into custody on June 16 last. He died five days later in the Peermedu sub-jail.

Multiple injuries

It was initially claimed that Rajkumar died of a natural cause, but a fresh post-mortem revealed multiple injuries, including fractures, contusions and bleeding. He was allegedly beaten up with canes, and chilli powder was used to torture him. The State government had ordered the Crime Branch to probe the death. But Rajkumar’s family moved the High Court for a CBI probe. In October 2019, the court directed the CBI to get all documents from the police.

Rajkumar’s family approached the High Court again, arguing that the CBI was yet to take over the probe. The State government submitted that it had already issued a notification referring the case to the CBI.

Subsequently, earlier this month, the High Court directed the agency to re-register the FIR immediately.

Some of the accused got bail last year. However, the Supreme Court cancelled their bail on December 16, 2019, pointing to the nature and number of the injuries — 22 — and the fact that the accused was in police custody and the previous report indicated no such injury on his person.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/m8nu56/article30661302.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cbi-takes-over-probe-into-kerala-custodial-death-case/article30661303.ece
157,2020/01/27,Nivetha Thomas on being 'Thalaivar's daughter' and life post 'Darbar',"Nivetha Thomas is candid when she says one of her immediate thoughts when she was offered to play Rajinikanth’s daughter in director A R Murugadoss’ Darbar is that she can speak Tamil on screen again, after Papanasam (the 2015 remake of Drishyam starring Kamal Haasan and Gauthami). Then, the other aspects sunk in. Like the father-daughter storyline was pivotal to the story and she had something substantial in a film starring Rajinikanth.

Chennai-based actor and architect Nivetha began her acting career with Malayalam and then Tamil films, and in the last few years became a name to reckon with in Telugu cinema, since her debut in Gentleman (2016) to her last release, the crime-comedy caper Brochevarevarura (2019).

Talking about playing a daughter of a veteran star actor, again, after Papanasam, she says, “I look at what character I get to do in each film, not if it’s that of a leading lady or some other part. When I got this part, I felt happy that I haven’t been stuck with an image.”

Post the release of Darbar, she hasn’t stopped answering adulatory phone calls or social media messages. “I thought the frenzy would be for a couple of days post release, but it’s been two weeks,” she says with a laugh.

After she was signed for Darbar, Nivetha went to AVM Studios in Chennai where Rajinikanth was in a photo shoot. “That’s when it actually sunk in, that I was standing in front of THE Rajinikanth. I was asked to be part of one of the photo sessions,” she recalls.

Nivetha felt the father-daughter on-screen bond would work best if she actually shared a rapport with the superstar, and found him easy to approach and talk to: “From day one, I would talk to him and discuss the method of work.”

She didn’t have the luxury of pre-production script reading sessions where actors get to understand each other’s working methods. “Each film unit and director work differently and I’ve learnt to go with the flow. With Darbar, I went straight to shoot and from time to time would have discussions about my scenes. It’s a mass film and the audience would primarily come to watch Rajini sir. Keeping with the film’s format, I understood that I needed to peak every emotion rather than keep it subtle, and at the same time not go over the top. In the end, I knew that if something happened to Rajinikanth’s daughter in the film, it has to be enacted in a way that the audience empathises with her plight,” Nivetha explains.

She’s happy she’s being appreciated as “Thalaivar’s daughter” and is keen to do more Tamil films, “Something has to pique my interest though. I wouldn’t do a film in any language just for the sake of it.”

Meanwhile, in Telugu she has finished shooting for her mentor Indraganti Mohanakrishna’s action thriller V starring Nani, Sudheer Babu, and Aditi Rao Hydari. Word in the film circles is that she’s also part of the Telugu remake of Pink starring Pawan Kalyan and the remake of Korean film Midnight Runners. She refrains from commenting. Prod her some more and she says, “I can neither confirm nor deny these films.”

I remind her that the last time we spoke prior to the release of Brochevarevarura, she ‘neither confirmed nor denied’ that she was part of Darbar. Is this a similar case? “I won’t say anything,” she laughs heartily.

When Nivetha debuted in Telugu cinema, everyone on sets would see her study during break time and complete her bachelor course in architecture. There were times when she wondered why she took on the gruelling schedule of academics and cinema, but in hindsight, says architecture made her appreciate a creative field like cinema even more.

When she debuted as a child artist in Malayalam cinema in 2008, at the age of eight, it wasn’t like she had a gnawing passion for cinema. “After years I realised how much I loved it. At one point, I was keen to pursue aeronautical engineering. One of my teachers said I wouldn’t be able to act in films if I took up a course like aeronautical engineering. That’s when I realised I loved cinema and didn’t want to give it up,” she recalls.

Nivetha’s priority is cinema. An architectural project will involve time and commitment and that will have to wait.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/zgdam6/article30665244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nivetha,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nivetha-thomas-on-being-thalaivars-daughter-and-life-post-darbar/article30665247.ece
158,2020/01/27,‘Server Sundaram’ will bring out all facets of Santhanam: Anand Balki,"“I have learnt many lessons in life,” says Anand Balki, whose début film starring Santhanam, Server Sundaram, is finally releasing on January 31, after a delay of over two-and-a-half years. “I learnt that it is best to keep calm, be patient and not get emotional. This may be my first film, but I have been an entrepreneur for 15 years and therefore, handled the situation well,” he says, adding, “Idhu enakku padam illai, paadam.”

What was the reason for this unforeseen delay? Anand explains: “Once the film was completed, the producers (Kenanya Films and Miraacle Movies) handed it over to a distributor they trusted, who in turn handed it over to a sub-distributor. This sub-distributor mismanaged the entire thing and even played a lot of dirty games. I stood by the producers and sorted out all issues one after the other, closed off the debts of the sub-distributor, and with the intervention of Producers Council, we are now ready to release the film.”

Santhanam, on his part, lent a helping hand by foregoing a substantial part of his remuneration for the film. “He helped us get out of this difficult situation,” he says. A hotel management graduate, Anand gained considerable experience as a chef and later moved on to sales at a five-star hotel in Chennai. Later, he established an event management company. The movie buff that he is, he has also donned minor roles in a couple of films. When Anand came up with the premise of a story that he thought will be relevant today, he began writing the script. Not surprisingly, the chef-turned-filmmaker chose food as the central theme for his narration. “This is the first Indian film to be made entirely on food, and all events and emotions thematically align with food,” says Anand.

Once he penned it, he shared the script with his close friend, fashion photographer G Venket Ram. “After reading it, he asked me who I had in mind for the lead role, and I was keen on Santhanam,” says Anand about the film that revolves around an engineering drop-out whose father compels him to take up hotel management, and how he goes on to become a master chef.

Anand met Santhanam on the sets of Nanbenda, and narrated his script. He reconnected with the actor after eight months. “Enga poitinga Anand?,’ he asked me, “I was waiting to hear from you. I’m on board.” The filmmaker calls Santhanam a ‘one-take artiste’, and adds that the way he observes and improvises scenes is brilliant. He says that there is even a tearjerker scene involving the comedian-actor. “Server Sundaram will bring out all facets of the acting talent of Santhanam, and he beautifully balances comedy and seriousness,” says the director.

The Nagesh link Ace comedian Nagesh’s grandson Bijesh Nagesh, cast as a catering college student, plays the second lead in the film. In 1964, Nagesh played the lead role in a classic with the same title. “When I did a screen test, I had goosebumps,” says director Anand, who feels that Bijesh has a striking resemblance in his expression and body language to Nagesh.

Anand roped in his friends from the food industry as consultants as there was a lot of work involved, especially the spot cooking sequences shot in Goa and Dubai. The film also showcases 35 dishes, with Chef Venkatesh Bhatt being the chief consultant and Chef Raja Rajan Paul contributing inputs. “A film on food comes with a lot of challenges. Shooting live cooking where an array of dishes are displayed is not an easy task. When we were shooting the spot cooking sequence in Goa, there was a sudden downpour but we continued to shoot. Similarly, in the climax sequence shot in Dubai, the temperature was 46 degrees Celsius and we had to shoot in this temperature for three days, and it involved 25 junior artistes from various nationalities.”

Food is medicine Two songs from the film, composed by Santhosh Narayanan, have been garnering a lot of attention. ‘Unave Marundhu’, a song that talks about the medicinal value of the ancient Tamil way of eating, food preference and order of eating a meal, has been written by Vivek and rendered by Carnatic singers Ranjani and Gayatri. ‘Gama Gama’, rendered by folk musician Anthony Daasan and penned by Vivek, lists popular food items from every nook and corner of Tamil Nadu.

Server Sundaram will be the launchpad for 20 newcomers, and for some senior artistes (Rajan and Balaji), it is a comeback film. The female lead, Vaibhavi Shandilya, a Kathak dancer and Marathi theatre artiste, makes her début in Tamil. Veteran comedian Nagesh’s eldest grandson Bijesh makes his acting début in the film. Incidentally, the director was keen on using the title from Nagesh’s cult classic Server Sundaram (1964) directed by Krishnan-Panju. The rights for the title were with AVM and it was after completely reading the script, that they agreed to part with it. “It is destiny that the film is releasing on Nagesh’s death anniversary, and I consider it a blessing,” says Anand, who has already signed two films.

Apart from being a drama, the film will also have a strong message for society. “You are what you eat. We are misled by corporates and are missing out on our traditional nutritious food. Today, families don’t even sit together to share a meal, and are increasingly ignoring fitness and well being,” he says, “My film also talks about traditional food items of the State. I also insist on using the term samayal kalaignan, instead of samayalkaaran.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9ii6ji/article30663582.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MPServerSundaram005JPGCR2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/server-sundaram-will-bring-out-all-facets-of-santhanam-anand-balki/article30663584.ece

160,2020/01/27,Karti Chidambaram gets temporary relief from Madras HC in “tax evasion” case,"The Madras High Court on Monday extended till February 12 the interim stay granted by it on the proceedings against Congress MP Karti Chidambaram and his wife in connection with a case of alleged income tax evasion, pending before a special court here.

Justice M. Sundar passed the order on a petition by Karti Chidambaram, son of former union minister P. Chidambaram, and his wife Srinidhi seeking to stall proceedings against them in the special court constituted to hear cases related to MPs and MLAs after hearing arguments by senior counsel K T S Tulsi.

Tulsi, who appeared for the petitioners, argued that reassessment (of income) was time-barred under Section 153 (A) of the Income Tax Act.

The Court had on last Tuesday granted interim stay till Monday (January 27) on the matter releated to the alleged non-disclosure of ₹6.38 crore income by Mr. Karti and ₹1.35 crore by his wife in 2015.

The special court, which had earlier dismissed their discharge pleas, was to have framed charges against the petitioners on January 21.

With the extension of the interim stay, the special court cannot proceed with the framing of charges till February 12.

According to the Income Tax department, Mr. Karti, elected to Lok Sabha from Sivaganga constituency in the 2019 elections, and his wife had received the amount in cash for the sale of land at Muttukadu near here years ago but allegedly did not disclose it in their I-T returns.

The petitioners have also challenged the case being heard by the special court for MPs and MLAs on the ground that the transaction was completed and returns of income were filed in 2015 when Karti was not a member of Parliament.

The deputy director of income tax Investigation, Chennai, had filed a complaint on September 12, 2018 against the petitioners before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court-II (Economic Offences) for offences under sections 276c(1) and 277 of the I-T Act.

​The train would be very helpful for pilgrims and tourists from Kerala and southern districts of Tamil Nadu to visit Thirunallar in Karaikal district, and Nagore and Velankanni. Also, there is no train connecting Karaikal with the southern end of Kanyakumari, according to V.R. Dhanaseelane, president of Karaikal District Citizens’ Welfare Association.​

When the demand was raised by the travelling public in 2015, Southern Railway had responded by stating that the feasibility will be examined once the Punalur-Sengottai section opens.​ Since the section was opened two years ago, and a double line introduced between Thanjavur and Tiruchi, the train could be introduced via Thanjavur, Tiruchi, Madurai and Virudhunagar, Mr. Dhanaseelane, who is also the president of Karaikal Rail Users’ Welfare Association explained.​

In a letter to the Principal Chief Operations Manager, Neetu Ittyerah, during her visit to the town earlier this month, the Karaikal Rail Users’ Welfare Association requested the official for reintroduction of the fast passenger train in the interests of pilgrims and tourists.​

The association also conveyed to the visiting official the potential of operating new trains between Karaikal and other destinations: Karaikal Ajmere (on weekly basis); Karaikal-Patna via Vijayawada (on weekly basis); Karaikal-Rameswaram via Thiruvarur, Thiruthuraipoondi, Muthupettai, Adhirampattinam, Pattukkottai, Karaikudi and Manamadurai; and Karaikal-Thiruchendur via Thanjavur, Tiruchi, Madurai and Tirunelveli.​",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rail-travellers-seek-reintroduction-of-nagore-kollam-train/article30664324.ece
162,2020/01/27,"Tamil Nadu villagers use gram sabhas to oppose hydrocarbon, India-based Neutrino Observatory projects","Villagers in different parts of Tamil Nadu used gram sabha meetings, organised on Republic Day, to pass resolutions against initiatives such as the hydrocarbon exploration and India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) projects, which, they feared, would be detrimental to their respective regions.

Arguing that the hydrocarbon exploration project, for which the Union government recently did away with the need to obtain environmental clearance and hold public consultations, would adversely affect the fertile agricultural belt, several panchayats in Pudukottai, Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts adopted resolutions at the gram sabha meetings.

Acknowledging that a resolution against implementation of hydrocarbon project was adopted at Neduvasal Kizhakku panchayat, its president K. Dakshinamurthy told The Hindu that a petition containing signatures of around 300 to 400 villagers opposing the project was handed over to the panchayat.

A resolution was adopted to the effect that the project should not be implemented in fertile areas in Pudukottai district.

Mr. Dakshinamurthy said the views of the villagers should be taken before implementing any project which could affect their livelihood.

The resolutions were adopted at other panchayats as well, including Pullanviduthi and L.N. Puram in Pudukottai district; Kadiramangalam, Kathirinatham, Pillayarpatti, Ambalapattu Therkku, Ambalapattu Vadakku and Rajendram panchayats in Thanjavur district, and Koodur, Varambiam, Kothamangalam, Adhirangam and Kattimedu panchayats in Tiruvarur district.

Mr. Dakshinamurthy, however, said the project could be taken up in non-agricultural areas. He said a copy of the resolution would be handed over to the Block Development Officer for submission to the District Collectorate.

K. Paneerselvam, president of Pullanviduthi panchayat in Pudukottai district, said a similar resolution was adopted.

Mr. Paneerselvam said Pullanviduthi and other nearby villages in its vicinity were highly fertile and implementation of the project would affect the agricultural community, farm labourers and others dependent on this profession. The project would eventually result in migration of farm labourers to towns and cities in search of employment, he feared. The villagers were slowly recovering from the Gaja cyclone and the rural economy was in a very bad state.

C. Chinnadurai of L.N. Puram panchayat in Pudukottai district said the first resolution to be adopted at the Gram Sabha meeting was on opposing the hydrocarbon project.

Villagers of Pottipuram panchayat in Theni district passed a resolution against the INO. The meeting was chaired by village panchayat president Selvaraj to whom the villagers unanimously urged that the observatory should not be allowed to take roots in the village.

“We strongly oppose the project as it is harmful to the environment and the Western Ghats. There are seven villages in the Pottipuram panchayat and the residents of all the villages are together in this decision,” said a resident, Muthuliram, from Ramakrishnapuram village.

In Kadalur panchayat under R.S. Mangalam union in Ramanathapuram district, villagers passed a resolution against the 2x800 MW Uppur Supercritical Thermal power plant, a project of ₹12,655 crore. It faced opposition from the villagers ever since the foundation stone was laid in 2016.

The Kadalur panchayat comprises five villages and has 5,000 people and over 3,200 voters. “The area falls under the ecosensitive zone as there are mangroves and wetlands. Even as construction is on for the plant, debris is being dumped in the sea that affects fishing. Moreover, we will lose about 300 acres of agriculture land if the plant is allowed,” said Murugavalli Balan, the panchayat president.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xqa3l5/article30661330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26GRAMSABHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-villagers-use-gram-sabhas-to-oppose-hydrocarbon-india-based-neutrino-observatory-projects/article30661331.ece
163,2020/01/27,Accused held for extortion involved in cases in Kerala: police,"Five men from Palakkad, Kerala, who were arrested for abduction and extorting money from a garment businessman after luring him with a woman near Valparai, were involved in similar cases in Kerala, police said.

On Friday, the Aliyar police arrested Senthilkumar, 56, Kamaal, 51, Sathish, 31 and Ajayan, 38 and a woman named Sudha, 30 and Prasanth, 24 on Saturday in connection with the case.

While the woman is from Tiruppur, the men are from Palakkad. The police said that cases were filed against the five men in Kerala earlier for similar complaints, but no case was filed against the woman.

Assaulted by five men

According to the police, the 32-year-old businessman received a phone call from Sudha in December 2019. She invited him to a building in Poovalaparuthi village in Anamalai for a New Year party on December 31, where the complainant was assaulted by the five men and taken to Kerala.

The gang took away his car, jewellery and ₹ 27,500 in cash from the complainant and dropped him in Pollachi on January 2, police said.

He lodged a complaint with the Aliyar police on January 23, following which the police registered a case under Section 395 (Punishment for dacoity) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested the accused.

164,2020/01/27,TNPSC scam: accused re-marked scripts in a moving vehicle and replaced them,"The Crime Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police on Sunday arrested H. Omkanthan, 45, a TNPSC record clerk, for allegedly handing over the key to a safe containing answer script bundles to prime suspect Jayakumar of Chennai, who made fresh entries on select papers and replaced them at an opportune time. The police searched Omkanthan’s premises and seized a couple of mobile phones.

Investigators said the accused, in a midnight operation, took away the answer scripts of the TNPSC Group-IV Services examination from a vehicle and tampered with them, before replacing them.

Investigation revealed that Jayakumar had approached Omkanthan, seeking his help to access the answer scripts, and had offered him ₹15 lakh as a bribe. After taking ₹2 lakh as an advance, the clerk managed to get himself posted in Ramanathapuram district for examination duty on September 1, 2019.

Omkanthan was part of a team also comprising another TNPSC employee, Manickavel, and a police constable entrusted with transporting the answer scripts from the Sivaganga treasury to the TNPSC headquarters in Chennai in a parcel vehicle. After collecting the sealed bundles of answer scripts around 8 p.m., the team left for Chennai, and Jayakumar followed it in another vehicle.

At 10.30 p.m., the team stopped for dinner. While the others were in the restaurant, Omkanthan handed over the key to the safe to Jayakumar, who took select bundles away in his car. During the next few hours, he made fresh entries on the answer scripts of candidates from whom he had taken money. However, he could mark answers only on 39 answer scripts owing to time constraints.

When the escort team stopped near Vikravandi for tea, Jayakumar replaced the bundles, returned the key to Omkanthan and fled. The record clerk was aware that some candidates had used evaporative ink to mark answers, and that Jayakumar had made fresh entries.

The answer scripts reached the TNPSC headquarters shortly after noon. The offence took place in the intervening night of September 1 and 2, 2019 along the Sivaganga-Chennai national highway.

While a search is on for Jayakumar, a special team has arrested A. Balasundaraj, 45, of Seelayampatti in Theni district, who was a middleman in the scam.

Parrying questions on whether the TNPSC staff had checked the seal on the safe and the answer script bundles when they received the consignment, a CB-CID official said the investigation had revealed that both the seals were tampered with. The statement of the accused would further be corroborated with technical evidence, he said.

The CB-CID has so far arrested 9 persons, including three candidates, in connection with the scam. Investigation is on to determine who leaked the question paper to the prime suspect.

Candidates in soup

Sources in the investigation agency said all the 99 candidates who had paid for clearing the examination fraudulently and had used the pens with evaporative ink provided by the accused would have to face action, irrespective of whether or not they had passed.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnpsc-scam-accused-re-marked-scripts-in-a-moving-vehicle-and-replaced-them/article30661202.ece
165,2020/01/27,Robbers fleeing from police killed in accident,"A robbery attempt ended in disaster after two persons of a five-member gang were killed in a road accident while trying to escape from the police on Saturday.

Two suspects, including a 17-year-old first year engineering student, were arrested. Another suspect, also an engineering student, is absconding, police said.

The two who died in the accident were identified as Sathish, 20, and Yuvaraj, 19. Naveen has been arrested and the 17-year old student has been sent to the Government Observation Home in Kellys.

According to police, the juvenile, identifying himself as a woman, befriended Shanmugasundaram, 37, of Erode on social media. The main suspect Aadhi, 21, an engineering student, spoke to Shanmugasundaram and asked him to come to Madhavaram.

On Saturday, Shanmugasundaram arrived in the early hours and called the ‘girl’. Subsequently, Aadhi, Naveen, Yuvaraj, and Satish went to the spot and forced Shanmugasundaram to part with his belongings.

They snatched his ATM debit card and took the PIN number. While Naveen, Yuvaraj and Satish took it to the nearest ATM to withdraw money, a police patrol team spotted Aadhi, the juvenile and Shanmugasundaram and approached them.

166,2020/01/27,A-G stumbles upon his office history dating back to 1828,"If there is one place in Chennai where you can see, touch and feel historical remnants at every turn of your eye, it is the iconic Madras High Court building. Every brick in this building is steeped in history and it is here that Advocate General (A-G) Vijay Narayan recently stumbled upon the history of his own office since 1828.

Amazed to have discovered a nearly 200-year-old treasure trove of official communication between his English predecessors and top government officials of the colonial era, the A-G digitised the entire set of documents running into thousands of pages which were rotting in cupboards and turning brittle due to passage of time.

Issue of charter

It was on June 26, 1852 that Queen Victoria issued a charter to establish the High Court of Judicature at Madras for the Presidency of Madras. However, it was preceded by many other courts established here since 1687 and they included the Supreme Court of Judicature at Fort St. George established by George the third on December 26, 1800.

The documents digitised include those penned when the Supreme Court at Madras was in existence. Mostly handwritten in cursive, the documents show that communication between the Chief Secretary to Government and the Advocate General had always ended with an interesting complimentary closing ‘Your most obedient servant.’

A further rummage through these materials leads to legal opinions given by the Advocates General on varied issues, including those relating to the erstwhile Binny Mills in Chennai, establishment of the famous Demonte Colony near St. Mary’s Road here, sale of properties belonging to the then Nawabs and even on criminal cases booked against Englishmen.

An interesting letter among them is the one penned on January 22, 1862 by the then Advocate General T. Sydney Smith to the Chief Secretary. In that letter, Mr. Smith states that the only case in which he considered it necessary to appear for the Crown during the first criminal sessions of that year was a case of manslaughter (culpable homicide not amounting to murder).

In that case, one Thomas George Saunders of the Telegraph department had been charged with manslaughter of his horse keeper Ramudu in Nellore (now in Andhra Pradesh) on November 30, 1861. Stating that the prisoner was acquitted from the case by the presiding judge, Mr. Smith said he completely concurred with the decision.

“The alleged cause of death was a kick on the testicles but while there was nothing to show that the death resulted from any injury to those parts and much to show that the death resulted from natural causes as the Zillah surgeon deposed he had no doubt the evidence of the alleged kick was most unsatisfactory.

“It was only deposed to by two little boys of 8 and 12 years old who in many material respects contradicted with each other grossly and moreover on cross examination contradicted themselves and swore to particulars utterly incredible. These boys, moreover, it appears, were kept together in the house of Mr. Holman, Inspector of Police at Nellore for eight days and not allowed to leave it till they had made statements before the Magistrate,” the A-G said.

Further, referring to the Inspector having kept another witness in the case handcuffed for three days, Mr. Smith said: “It is chiefly on this account that I bring this case to the notice of His Excellency the Governor in Council. There is nothing before me to show that Mr. Holman, in doing so, was actuated by any improper motives.

‘Mistaken notion’

“Giving him the fullest credit for acting only from mistaken zeal, it is plain that he has a very mistaken notion of his duty as Inspector of Police.” Records further show that the Chief Secretary, in turn, had communicated the A-G’s letter to the then Inspector General of Police on January 30, 1862 and also marked a copy to the A-G’s office.

However, what action was taken against the Inspector is not found in the records. “Reading these records itself is a very difficult process because they are handwritten. The papers are also very fragile. So, I handed the job to a company that uses robotic arms to lift the documents and scan them and they charged me just ₹3 a page,” the A-G Mr. Narayan said.

The digitised documents include legal opinions given by Vanbakam Bhashyam Iyengar, the first Indian Advocate General of the Madras High Court, in 1897, when he was initially appointed as Acting AG before being made permanent. It is also interesting to note that only 45 lawyers had so far been able to make it to the post of Advocate General of Madras High Court since 1853.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/uhwmax/article30661120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THDOCUMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a-g-stumbles-upon-his-office-history-dating-back-to-1828/article30661125.ece

In a statement, he warned that the recommendation is very dangerous.

“The HLG’s argument that public health and hospitals are under the State List, while subjects like medical education, population control and family planning, should be pushed to concurrent list is frivolous. It also amounts to taking away State autonomy,” Dr. Ramadoss said.

169,2020/01/27,Coronavirus effect: kin of students studying in China a worried lot,"Relatives of students from Tamil Nadu studying in universities in China are gripped by anxiety and helplessness in the backdrop of the outbreak of coronavirus in China.

Hundreds of students from the State are pursuing higher education in various universities in China. Their relatives have been trying to reach out to them for several days now.

P. Arun, a resident of Pudukottai, said he was worried about the well-being of his brother P. Manishankar, a student of Wuhan University.

“The assurance on Sunday morning by the Central government to safeguard Indian students in China has given us hopes. But, there has been no further update. We feel helpless and expect some quick action,” Mr. Arun said.

Ravi, whose son, Robin Raj, from Nagapattinam, is studying medicine at the Wuhan university, sounded relieved after a telephonic talk with his son in the afternoon.

“I could gauge from our conversation that the Chinese authorities have planned to translocate the stranded people in Wuhan to a neighbouring province. As of now, no one has been permitted to go from Wuhan,” he said. A student from Tenkasi, who is pursuing medicine in Qingdao, said that since it is vacation time, many students had already left for their home town in Tamil Nadu.

“There are about 150 students pursuing medicine here. Some students who decided to stay back have booked tickets to Tamil Nadu last week since a few cases were reported in Qingdao as well,” said the student.

Centre in touch

Central government officials are in touch with Indian students in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei province. They are also talking with local governments regarding their safety and the possibility of their return, sources said.

The officials are contacting universities to find out about the re-opening dates and several institutions have deferred the reopening. Students have been advised to avoid non-essential travel.

Meanwhile, the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine along with Airports Authority of India officials, continues to screen passengers from China at airports in Chennai, Tiruchi and Coimbatore. Isolation wards are ready in all government medical college hospitals. K. Kolandaswamy, director of public health, said thermal screening along with symptomatic screening was being done at the airports.

170,2020/01/27,Coverage under PM-KISAN not even 50%,"Only 45% of farmers in the State have been enrolled under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), a Central scheme of cash support for farmers, which will complete its first year of implementation in a few weeks.

Though there are about 79.38 lakh farm holdings (regarded as farmers) in the State as per the Agricultural Census 2015-16, only around 35.54 lakh farmers have been covered under the scheme. The figure cited by the State government is 36.73 lakh.

Various reasons

A number of reasons have been attributed for the current situation of coverage. Primarily, the presence of multiple holders of land documents (’patta’, ‘chitta’ and ‘adangal’) within a family has brought down the figure of beneficiaries, as the scheme does not recognise them within the same family.

“The cash support is meant for a family and not an individual,” clarifies a senior official of the State Agriculture Department. A number of people have been excluded owing to the eligibility conditions of the scheme. Furthermore, as the scheme is for landowners, tenants have been excluded from it.

S. Venkatesan, a farmer who hails from Cuddalore district, estimates conservatively that 10% to 20% of eligible farmers in his district have not been covered due to a number of procedural hassles such as the insistence on having an SB account in a nationalised bank and the long waiting period for inclusion after submission of documents.

He suggests that the authorities make public at periodic intervals the lists of beneficiaries, district-wise, so that those who satisfy the conditions of the scheme would not have to submit the documents over and over again.

But Seeniappan, a farmer from Chinnapudur village in Dharmapuri district, has a different story to narrate. “If you submit the proper documents, you are included,” he says, recalling that originally, he was not a beneficiary as he does not come under the category of “small and marginal farmers” but under “other (big) farmers”.

After the scheme’s ambit was expanded in June last year to include all types of farmers, regardless of landholding, he has received two instalments of the cash support.

Thangaraj and his wife, who own half-an-acre in Kothapalli village of Dindigul district, did not experience any problem in getting covered even during the launch of the scheme about an year ago.

Appreciating the Central and State governments for implementing the scheme, Mr. Thangaraj says he has been using the cash for buying fodder.

G. Ajeethan, technical secretary to the Consortium of Indian Farmers’ Associations, and a farmer based in Mohanur of Namakkal district, says that though the authorities are, in a phased manner, covering eligible farmers, there are still issues being faced by the community of agriculturists at the time of authentication of bank accounts and verification of documents, the process of which, he says, is “quite rigorous”. There is a clamour among the farmers for enhancement of the amount of cash support.

SB account

However, the official explains that the insistence on having an SB account in a nationalised bank is being made as most of the farmers had originally given details of bank accounts which were linked to Kisan Credit Cards or loan accounts.

But “the Central government has given instructions not to adjust the scheme’s cash support to any liability of the farmers, including loans,” the official points out.

Acknowledging that the verification, of which there are multiple levels, may cause delays, the official says this ensures “less errors”.

To increase the coverage, the State government has been pursuing with the Centre the inclusion of around 1.24 lakh lessee farmers who are using lands of temples in the State, the official adds.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vgpeyc/article30661058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PM-KISANcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/coverage-under-pm-kisan-not-even-50/article30660897.ece
171,2020/01/27,Sena Medal for Dhoni’s Army buddy,"“Army is a way of life,” says Captain A. Ranjith Kumar, a native of Tamil Nadu who has been selected for the Army's Sena Medal (Gallantry) this year for his key role in an operation in the Kashmir Valley.

Being the son of an employee of a Sainik School in Tiruppur district, it was natural for him to aspire to get into the military school.

“Through the Army, one can serve the country while also pursuing their dreams. In my case, adventure is my passion,” says the paratrooper attached to the 23rd battalion of the prestigious Parachute Regiment, which recently received the Army chief's citation award.

Captain Kumar was part of an operation in the Kashmir Valley in which key extremists were eliminated. The details of the operation cannot be published for security reasons.

“We spent about two years collecting intelligence and planning our strategy. We coordinated with various government agencies, and it eventually paid off,” says the officer over the phone from Delhi.

Captain Kumar and former India cricket captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni became friends when the latter was made an honorary Lieutenant Colonel in the Territorial Army and underwent training. Captain Kumar fondly remembers playing carrom and table tennis with the cricketing legend.

“We met during our para jumps. He is a good friend and like a mentor. After my father and my school, Dhoni has been a great source of support and motivation,” says Captain Kumar, who was recently adjudged the best in the High Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg . He has also trained with the U.S. Special Forces.

It was an unnecessary controversy, created by various Periyarist movements. I stand by Mr. Rajinikanth, who had refused to apologise because he did not utter a single word against Periyar or his works, philosophy and reservation policy. He has no ulterior motives. He spoke about the rally, in which Hindu Gods were depicted in a derogatory manner, only to praise Thuglak founder Cho. Ramasamy and describe how he became popular across the country. The DMK government led by Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) sought to prevent the sale of the magazine carrying the pictures in question to avoid a Hindu backlash in the 1971 election. It drew the nation’s attention. By ganging up against Mr. Rajinikanth, the Periyarists have once again brought the denigration of Hindu deities to the limelight, and now, those incidents are haunting them.

Hasn’t the reaction to the actor’s comments proved that Periyar continues to enjoy a prominent place in Tamil society and among Tamils?

It is also my wish that Periyar should always have a prominent place in Tamil society. We should be grateful to him. I have even told Mr. Rajinikanth that even when he was 95, unmindful of the pain caused by hernia and having to carry a catheter to facilitate urination, Periyar addressed the people, and I remain a witness to his commitment. You cannot come across a leader like him, who had toiled for the welfare of the people. Mr. Rajinikanth told me that he was amazed by Periyar’s dedication.

On the one hand, you admire Periyar, and on the other, you castigate the Dravidian Movement..

Except Periyar, all the others are selfish. Periyar was a personification of self-denial. Never in his life did he seek to do anything for self-benefit, and you cannot find that virtue in any of the other Dravidian leaders. The leaders of the DMK and the AIADMK do not possess even an iota of that virtue. Periyar made his last speech on December 19, 1973 and spelt out the basic principles of a man of self-respect. They are atheism, anti-religion, anti-Congress, anti-Gandhi and anti-Brahminism. This is his true will, as it was espoused by him a week before his death. He never supported the Congress, but only expressed solidarity with Kamaraj.

But Mr. Rajinikanth’s speech is being seen as a stand favouring the BJP...

That is why I want to make it clear that even if Mr. Rajinikanth enters into an alliance with the BJP, it is a different matter...He is entering politics to protect the interests of every section of society. He refuses to be confined to the sectarian politics of casteism and religion. When Jayalalithaa joined hands with the BJP in 1998, the Periyarists and DMK leader Karunanidhi accused her of letting poisonous snakes into Tamil Nadu. He described the BJP leaders as “Pandarams and Paradeshis”. In one year, he formed an alliance with the BJP and became part of the government.DMK founder Anna entered into an alliance with RajajiIf Anna joined forces with Rajaji or Kalaignar joined hands with the BJP, you say it was electoral strategy. Why then do you come to the conclusion that Mr. Rajinikanth will change if he forms an alliance with the BJP?

Can individuals like Mr. Rajinikanth bring about change in politics?

If a person who does not want a single penny for his personal benefit enters politics, everything will fall into place. Reformation should begin at the top. When the entire Cabinet is against corruption, the IAS officers in Fort St. George will realise that they can command respect only if they are straightforward. But Rome was not built in a day. I will not say that corruption will disappear the day Mr. Rajinikanth assumes office. But the work to eradicate corruption will begin.

What is your assessment of the political trend in the State for the 2021 Assembly polls?

The Assembly election will entail a direct contest between Mr. Rajinikanth and DMK leader M.K. Stalin. The AIADMK will have no role to play. It is power and money that cement the AIADMK’s place in politics. Anarchy and confusion will prevail in the party on the day it loses power, and this will lead to the party losing the ‘Two Leaves’ symbol. But the DMK has a base and enjoys 20 to 25% vote bank. Barring the corrupt, all followers of MGR in the AIADMK will switch loyalty to Mr. Rajinikanth. Though Mr. Stalin has the advantage of a strong party organisation, women voters will favour Mr. Rajinikanth. Even Kalaignar could not win over women voters in toto. Women mostly favoured MGR and Jayalalithaa, and will now vote for Mr. Rajinikanth.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8b7pzn/article30660737.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27TAMILARUVIMANIAN2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tying-up-with-bjp-doesnt-mean-accepting-its-ideology/article30660738.ece

The party, with the support of its ally AIMIM retained the NMC, winning the Mayor post and giving up the Deputy Mayor post to the latter.

177,2020/01/27,Jagan seeks exemption from CBI court appearance,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, who is facing a batch of quid pro quo cases registered by the CBI at a special court here, has moved Telangana High Court seeking exemption from court appearances.

Eleven criminal petitions were filed by Mr. Reddy in the HC to permit appearance of his lawyer on his behalf in the 11 charge-sheets filed by the CBI. He challenged the CBI special court’s order given on November 1, 2019 dismissing his petition seeking exemption from court appearances.

Mr. Reddy stated that he had to attend to official duties in his capacity as CM and it was becoming difficult to appear before the court regularly. He stated that security issues, huge expenses and protocol rules were involved in his journey from Vijayawada to Hyderabad.

Earlier, the HC rejected his petitions for exemption from court appearances. However, in the changed scenario of he becoming the CM of the State and the need to look after the administrative responsibility, the exemption from court appearances was needed, he stated.

All the 11 petitions were listed for hearing before Justice G. Sri Devi bench on Tuesday. During the previous hearing by the CBI special court, which was holding the proceedings in-camera, reportedly told Mr. Reddy’s counsel that his petitions to dispense with presence would not be allowed.

Mr. Reddy, who had attended the special court while being the main opposition leader in AP Assembly, became the Chief Minister in 2019 elections. The special court had exempted him from court appearance from time to time after he became CM but passed a direction insisting his presence in the court a few days ago.

For the first time, Mr. Reddy appeared before the court on this January 9.

179,2020/01/27,Suryapet Collector transferred,"District Collector D. Amoy Kumar has been transferred to Rangareddy district as Collector with immediate effect following concerns raised by the State Election Commission on Monday.

He was also the District Election Officer for the gram panchayat elections, the general election, the Huzurnagar by-election in October 2019 and the recently-concluded urban local body polls.

The transfer of Mr. Kumar on the day of election of chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of various municipalities on Monday, assumes significance, after the Congress registered a strong protest in connection with election of chairperson and vice-chairperson in Nereducherla municipality.

The municipal commissioner of Nereducherla, accepted the option of Congress Rajya Sabha MP KVP Ramachandra Rao, given on January 25, as ex-officio member of Nereducherla and replied the same day informing about the special meeting for the election on Monday.

Uttam’s protest

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, following the development, launched a sit-in protest outside the District Collector’s residence late on Sunday night. However, his repeated pleas to Mr. Kumar to rectify the anomaly went in vain.

Ramachandra Rao who preferred to cast his vote as ex-officio member from Nereducherla. The Congress members raised objections to the decision and staged impromptu protests.

The matter was later taken to the notice of the State Election Commission where the Congress members complained about the “unilateral action” of the returning officer. The SEC, after thorough examination of the issue, announced that it had suspended the orders issued by the Nereducherla Municipal Commissioner rejecting the option exercised by Dr. Ramachandra Rao.

“KVP Ramachandra Rao’s eligibility as ex-officio voter, a Rajya Sabha member representing Telangana, was accepted and he was invited for voting. But TRS Minister Jagadish Reddy brought pressure and forced the Commissioner to remove the vote,” he alleged.

Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy’s protest against removing Mr. Ramachandra Rao’s option started outside the District Collector’s residence late night on Sunday, and continued outside the Nereducerla Municipal Office till the State Election Commission (SEC) intervened on Monday morning.

Telangana MP

The Nalgonda MP who spoke with media, disclosing the Rajya Sabha member’s documents, said Mr. Ramachandra Rao was still representing Telangana with nodal district as Hyderabad for MPLADS and other protocol.

“The Rajya Sabha website says it, his Parliament ID card says it; the Commissioner had accepted, and later on January 26 he sent a notice rejecting his option. This clearly is the index of TRS’ faith in democracy,” the Congress leader said.

Intervening just before the election at 11 a.m. on Monday, the SEC suspended the decision of Nereducherla Commissioner in rejecting the option of Mr. Ramachandra Rao.

“The plenary powers of Superintendence and control of elections to ULBs are vested in the SEC. The Commissioner’s action appears without any jurisdiction, legal basis and taken in haste,” it noted, with instructions that the election could be held at 4 p.m. the same day, or the next day.

Alleging unilateral decisions and corruption in distributing tickets to wards, the party leaders and workers raised the slogan of “Payal Shankar Hatao, BJP Bachao” at a press conference here.

Party State Executive Comittee member Ch. Suhasini Reddy said party workers had it enough and decided to revolt after the Municipal election. “No one will leave the party but will refuse to work under the incumbent,” she said.

Chances lost

Office bearers from mandals and towns narrated their experiences in denial of tickets to eligible and deserving candidates even in the Panchayat Raj and Zilla Parishad and Mandal Parishad elections. “Had it not been for Mr. Shankar’s unilateral decisions in allocation of tickets, the BJP would have had its candidate getting elected as Adilabad ZP chairperson,” party vice president Dipak Singh Shekhawat alleged.

This has enabled the latter to get its councillors elected to the crucial posts.

Competition from the opposition party looked very likely as its candidates had won in five wards - same as the TRS - of the total 12 wards, while the BJP and an independent won from the remaining two in the newly formed urban local body (ULB).

Councillor elect absent

In fact, one Congress councillor elect absented herself from the crucial meeting to elect the top two incumbents during the day, while the independent candidate supported the TRS candidates making it easy for the ruling party. The proceeedings saw Ankam Rajender and Abdul Khaleel of the TRS getting elected as chairman and vice chairman respectively.

The going was much easy for the TRS in nine of the remaining 10 municipalities in the former composite Adilabad district. The only ULB to have eluded the ruling party was Bhainsa, which saw the All India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen’s (AIMIM) Sabiha Begum and Jabir Ahmed getting elected as chairperson and vice chairperson respectively.

191,2020/01/27,Indecision over part of Anjanagiri reservoir bund delays its completion,"Indecision over the type of structure or bund to plug the gap between two hillocks as part of the construction of Anjanagiri reservoir, a key component of Palamuru-Rangareddy Lift Irrigation Scheme, is likely to delay the completion of the first storage point of the project.

Of the three reaches of bund construction to form the reservoir, work is nearing completion in two reaches — one and three — but it is yet to take-off in reach-two. According to the project engineers, of the 11.22 km length required to form the reservoir bund, construction of 6.5 km length bund is required to be formed in three reaches and the surrounding hillocks form the remaining 4.72 km of bund.

After the water is lifted from Srisailam reservoir, it first reaches Anjanagiri reservoir, being constructed between Anjangiri and Narlapur villages, for its onward journey. The reservoir is displacing (submergence) Anjanagiri, Sunnapu Thanda, Vadde Gudiselu and part of Borabada villages in Kollapur mandal. Project officials stated that implementation of relief and rehabilitation package has been completed for all affected villages, except a few individual farmers, as per GO 123.

After finding no trace of rock base even after drilling for over 30 metres in the gorge between the two hillocks which forms reach-two of the reservoir bund running for a length of 675m at the top and 220m at the bottom, the project engineers approached experts of Tehri Dam in Uttarakhand, which has the highest rock-fill dam (RFD) in the world at 264 m and can withstand earthquakes in the magnitude of even 10 on the Richter scale.

A team of Tehri experts led by Executive Director of Tehri Hydro Power Corporation Rajeev Vaishnoi visited the Anajanagiri site in February last and recommended construction of RFD there. According to official sources, it did not make further progress after the corporation asked for ₹50 lakh consultation for sharing the technology. The reach-two of Anjanagiri reservoir bund requires a height of 74 m.

During Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s visit to project works in August-end last year, when the engineers explained about borrowing RFD technology, the former was understood to have suggested altering the reservoir bund design. The alternative link avoiding the original reach-two location would, however, increase the project cost by ₹120 crore and at the same time would reduce the reservoir storage capacity by 2.2 tmc from the original 8.51 tmc ft.

When contacted, project officials stated that there was no clearance for either of the possible ways to complete the reach-two of the Anjanagiri reservoir bund.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/urmq06/article30662979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26ANJANAGIRIRESERVOIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/indecision-over-part-of-anjanagiri-reservoir-bund-delays-its-completion/article30662980.ece
192,2020/01/27,Governor hosts ‘At Home’ on Republic Day,"Governor Dr. Tamilisai Soundararajan on Sunday hosted the traditional ‘At Home’ on the sprawling lawns of Raj Bhavan here to mark 71st Republic Day.

The event witnessed the participation of Chief Justice of Telangana High Court Raghvendra Singh Chauhan, Chief Minister K Chandrasekar Rao, Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy, State Legislative Assembly Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, senior politicians from different parties, bureaucrats, police officers, as well as officials from the Armed forces.

Prominent among those who attended the At Home include former Maharashtra Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao, actor Brahamanandam, Telangana Ministers Mohammed Mahmood Ali, Satyavathi Rathod, Puvvada Ajay Kumar and TRS Parliamentary Party leader K Keshava Rao.

In addition to that, Malkajgiri MP A Revanth Reddy, BJP State president K Laxman, MLC N. Ramchander Rao, TDP State president L Ramana, CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy and other senior leaders of various political parties attended.

193,2020/01/27,Meditation in bronze: Kamla Ravikumar’s exhibition puts the spotlight on yoga,"On close inspection, Kamla Ravikumar’s work in copper looks like abstract curves. But take a step back and look at it again, a human figurine performing a yoga asana presents itself.

In her recently-concluded exhibition ‘Body, Mind and Soul’ at Centre for Soft Power in Kotturpuram, the artist featured a collection of works in bronze, copper, acrylic and mixed media — all under the common theme of yoga.

While you have the dhyani mudra, navasana, chakravakasana as bronze sculptures, you have the apana asana made of copper wire. “I had tried plaster of Paris, fiber glass and bronze so far, and I thought why not try a different medium? I am also a stain glass artist and I use a lot of copper wire for that. I was playing around with one, and accidentally made a very unusual human form. That’s when the idea of experimenting with yoga poses in copper struck me.”

Kamala has been working towards this collection of yoga art since three years, but her passion for yoga started seven years ago. “I got a teachers’ training certificate from Yoga Rakshanam in Besant Nagar. That’s where I used to practice,” she says.

It was yoga, she reveals, that helped her cope with a serious illness. Though she refuses to divulge how she battled the illness (“I want my art to represent me, not the disease,” she says), she is enthusiastic about the role yoga played in it. “It gives your body discipline and relaxes you when you are going through huge amounts of stress.”

In fact, there is much similarity between the practice of art and yoga. The room at Centre for Soft Power has a calming vibe to it, helped by a couple of paintings of meditative faces, titled Zen 1 and 2. Their eyes closed, the chakra between the eyebrows pulsates, creating ripples around it, while the two backgrounds sit in contrast — one of modern geometry, in black silver and hot pink, and the other a joyful yellow.

“When I have had a bad day, and I come back and paint, it calms me down, Even more so when I am doing these paintings,” she says, waving her hand around. Right up the front is the dhyani mudra, that she practises every morning before doing pranayama.

In her paintings of matsyasana and bitilasana, human figures appear against the backdrop of the animals they are inspired by. “I hope that this will make it easier to understand and remember the poses,” she says. The paintings also incorporate tribal art styles of Madhubani and Gond. “I teach many Korean students Warli art, there is a lot of interest in this area.”

Kamla’s works can be bought together, or as separate asanas.

194,2020/01/27,We stroll through the artists’ workspaces and processes at Cholamandal Artists’ Village,"The unforgiving afternoon sun flits through the trees, as small groups trickle into the expansive Cholamandal Artists’ Village, hoping to catch a glimpse of what makes the village exclusive. A hotbed of arts, the self-governing establishment, set up by KCS Paniker in 1966, is caught in a time warp — away from the noise of the city, predominantly housing artists who live in a world of motifs. Save a few new buildings and roads, not much has changed — for instance, the open air theatre, now brimming with fallen leaves, still houses the stone sculpture of the family riding a two wheeler, by Vasudevan Namboodiri.

Today, the roads that branch out into galleries and residences, are lined with construction debris. But this doesn’t deter the students, art connoisseurs and families, who devote their weekend to meet veteran artists whose works often surface in the city’s gallery spaces as part of Open Studios. Anyone is welcome into their workspaces and homes — as artworks and sculptures flank the studio, their creator is seen interacting with enthusiasts.

When I walk into sculptor P S Nandhan’s home, he is knee-deep in a conversation with a couple of art students, who listen to him intently. He tells them that perseverance and practice are what made his work what it is today. His crowded studio houses everything from paintings and sketches to sculptures. “I started off with paintings, but slowly, they translated into sculptures. You see, art is everywhere,” says Nandhan pointing to his Budhha series done in unbaked clay. A recurring motif, in his works, is that of intertwined human figures — this element resonates in his sculptures as well. An unfinished abstract work portraying an embrace, done in wood, is testimony to the same.

Artist Sailesh BO’s workspace, beyond the open air theatre, is a cocoon of colours. Outside the studio, hang small figurines — his signature representations of animal heads married to human bodies, in yogic poses. The same concept is translated into canvases, which are stacked inside the studio. A colourful palette and many brushes dipped in water, and an unfinished abstract painting, suggest that the artist had left the studio only moments ago. Meanwhile, S G Vasudev’s gallery space, in the same backyard, emanates a soft yellow glow. Apart from a few smaller works — some of them from his Rhapsody series — those on display are mostly in the form of merchandise such as mugs, coasters and notepads, which are also on sale.

The ground floor of Bhagwan and Prasida Chavan’s residence is replete with mini looms, wound on which are yarns of every colour; an indigo door mat is being woven. Upstairs is where artist Bhagwan works — his abstract pieces, earlier and others, adorn every wall on the top floor. To the backdrop of a 1990s Hindi classic, guests stroll through, as if in a gallery. He admits that his latest works look different in terms of technique. “I would call this series a process. I used to do a lot with the drip technique, which has now changed to become more definite,” says Bhagwan. Blues, greens and blacks intertwine to form a grid of colours on his canvases.

An attempt to encourage dialogue within the community, Open Studios thus tries to subvert the notion that art and its creator should remain distanced from the viewer.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/mffccc/article30665934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28MPPSNANDHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/we-stroll-through-the-artists-workspaces-and-processes-at-cholamandal-artists-village/article30665936.ece
195,2020/01/27,VR Chennai’s public art project centres around the theme of sustainability,"Against the backdrop of a well-lit, swanky Marks and Spencer showroom stands a fish, cordoned off but bang in the middle of a crowded passage through which scattered crowds pass by every minute.

The fish has plastic bottles for its scales and a styrofoam plate for an eye. Patches of blue peep from its feeble brown skin that is made of cloth. One of the many such surprising finds at VR Chennai’s vast corridors, the fish is artist Karthikeyan’s attempt at portraying sustainability in a tangible manner. Another is the authoritative human figure (with folded hands) made entirely with a wooden chequerboard. On him are pawns, some on the verge of being knocked over, while others stuck firmly to his body. This creation of artist Yuvaraj Velu, the Strategist, thus explores the universal phenomena of good and evil.

Inclusive art

The second edition of Madras Art Guild is a collaborative effort mounted on a scale larger than the previous year’s, with art works and installations flanking every 100 metres of the mall’s ground floor. Centered around the theme of sustainability, the public art initiative, which will span over a month, is an attempt at making art accessible for artists and connoisseurs alike, and encourages active participation of the student community across Tamil Nadu, along with veteran artists. The installations, designed to invite passers-by to engage with them, are often met with confused faces, who finally resort to clicking selfies. Many linger while some miss them altogether. However, the idea welcomes people from all walks of life to stop, take a pause and reflect. Which is also why they are not distanced from the viewer through vitrines or encasements. Though cordoned off, viewers are expected to approach and observe them closely.

While the ground floor is dotted by installations from collectives, art students and veteran artists alike, the Fine Art Room in Madras House displays the canvases and paintings. “It is incredible how all the artists who have participated have come onboard with the theme,” says curator Sumi Gupta, adding, “Not just in terms of the concept, but in terms of materials — made from found objects, brick, wood, garbage and so on.”

Another idea was to expand the spectrum of art by going beyond fine art and installations, and to include a fashion show featuring ‘wearable art’ by students of National Institute of Fashion Technology. These creations will later be displayed on mannequins as part of the festival. “Other than the fine art, sculptures and installations, we will be having art cinema screenings and conducting workshops for children and adults, all centered around this topical theme,” says Sumi.

Breaking tradition

A lot of collaborations this year were born out of the response received last year, she adds. Premier institutions like the Government College of Fine Arts in Chennai, College of Fine Arts in Kumbakonam, Cholamandal Artists’ Village and Chennai Photo Biennale have come onboard with students’ and alumni contributions. Indian Garbage Collective, a team of young artists who collects junk and transforms them into installations — imagine a dragonfly, whose parts are made from discarded PVC pipes — has displayed quite a few works. These installations stand alongside works of reputed artists like Seema Kohli, Parvathi Nayar, Jacob Jebaraj and Michael Wegener.

“Traditionally, art is restricted to galleries, and is associated with socialising. We are trying to break that notion. Public art has the ability to transform the environment. Whether you like it or not, you will still have a reaction to it. In that sense, having such a venue, and the space that comes with it, is important,” says Sumi.

The idea is to engage with the art, in a way that every single viewer finds comfortable. But does the essence of an artwork get lost in the chaos associated with the space? “On the contrary, I think it gets magnified. Amidst the noise, you can concentrate on an element of beauty, thought and craftsmanship where you least expect it. In a gallery, you are almost desensitised. Here, it wows you,” she adds.

196,2020/01/27,Colourful boats and Tom Burckhardt’s imagination,"When artist Tom Burckhardt came to Kochi for his art residency at Pepper House, Fort Kochi, last December, his area of interest was the ‘panchavarna’ colour scheme of Kerala mural paintings. That is until his first day at Pepper House, where the windows of his room opened to an array of eye-catchingly colourful fishing boats, sporting distinctive colours and patterns, parked in the waters. The sight inspired Tom to find out more about them.

The artworks inspired by what he saw and experienced here will be on display at an ‘open studio’ at Pepper House. A cardboard installation by him was part of the Kochi Muziris Biennale (2016) on display at Aspinwall.

As part of his research, Tom came across the State government mandate that requires fishing boats to observe a specific pattern in colouring. As per it fishing boats in Kerala are always painted blue and scarlet (red)/ orange whereas the ones from Tamil Nadu are green and the others with white as their primary colour are from the Maldives. Tom replaced his painting kit with enamel paints procured from local paint stores to use the same colour as that of the fishing boats for his abstractions to come to life.

“Abstractions are challenging,” the 55 year-old artist says, as these necessitate a heightened state of creativity to make the work feel real to the viewer. Apart form the abstractions that form part of his work, Tom maintains a sketchbook where he makes portraits of people he meets while bicycling around Fort Kochi.

Tom has immersed himself in colours all his life as an artist who graduated with a degree in painting from the State University of New York. Born into a family of artists, his love for art began as kid - he was interested in making comic books and clay models.

He is all set to carry his abstract art work to the State University in New York where he will be lecturing on the same.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/r5zbme/article30663425.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWN0424jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/tom-burckhardts-current-abstracts-done-as-part-of-his-pepper-house-residency-are-inspired-by-the-fishing-boats/article30663428.ece

198,2020/01/27,Locusts spotted in Punjab and Haryana villages bordering Rajasthan,"Presence of locusts in a few villages of Punjab and Haryana bordering Rajasthan has raised anxiety among farmers about their crops. The agriculture departments of both the States have asked the farmers not to panic as it was “not a serious threat”'.

Experts believe that appearance of locusts in winter months is a new phenomenon and may be linked to climate change. The surveillance by the scientists of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) and officials of the State agriculture department has revealed the presence of locusts in small numbers or groups (of 5 to 20) in districts of Fazilka, Muktsar and Bathinda.

Dr. P.K. Chhuneja, Head of the Department of Entomology at PAU said: “These hoppers in small numbers or groups do not cause any economic damage to crops unless they appear in swarms. The current excursions of locust hoppers are well monitored and suitable control measures are in place. These small non-breeding groups do not carry any serious threat.”

India has not witnessed any full blown locust cycles after 1962, however, during 1978 and 1993, large-scale upsurges were observed. The locust attack has been reported since past several days in parts of Rajasthan which has emanated from the desert areas in Pakistan.

Harmeet Singh of Bharati Kisan Union (Kadiyan) told The Hindu that presence of locusts has been reported by farmers in a few villages in Bathinda, Fazilka and Muktsar, and hence State government should not leave anything to chance.

‘No locust attack’

Punjab Agriculture Secretary Kahan Singh Pannu, meanwhile said that so far there’s no attack of locusts in Punjab. “Farmers should not to be panicky as the officials of the department are in constant touch with the agri-experts of Rajasthan and the Centre government. Besides, the State government has already made elaborate arrangements to combat any unforeseen exigency in this regard, he said.

In Haryana, locusts were spotted by farmers in few villages of Sirsa district adjacent Rajasthan. Ram Pratap Sihag, Joint Director (Agriculture), said locusts were spotted in very few numbers and not in swarms. “There's nothing to worry,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/locusts-spotted-in-punjab-and-haryana-villages-bordering-rajasthan/article30669152.ece
199,2020/01/27,Training for civil servants from Bangladesh at Punjab institute,"The Mahatma Gandhi State Institute of Public Administration, Punjab, (MGSIPA) on Monday joined a select set of training institutes in the country that have been chosen for training top civil servants from other nations.

MGSIPA commenced training of civil servants from Bangladesh, in collaboration with the National Centre for Good Governance (NCGG) here, said an official statement.

The Bangladesh Administrative Services officers who are participating in the programme include those in the rank of Additional Deputy Commissioners, Additional District Magistrates and Chief Executive Officers of different administrative departments. India and Bangladesh had signed a Memorandum of Understanding for training of civil servants from Bangladesh at the National Centre for Good Governance, Mussoorie, in Uttarakhand.

Best practices

“Such programme also integrates cross-country experiences and best practices in field administration and good governance,” Mr. Sidhu said.

200,2020/01/27,Call for ban on surrogate tobacco advertising,"After the Presidential assent to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Amendment Bill prohibiting the opening and running of hookah bars in Rajasthan, voluntary groups working for tobacco control here have called for a ban on surrogate advertising of tobacco products. The tobacco industry is looking for new consumers and is trying the “catch them young” tactics, said the groups.

Bar on Hookah bars

The Amendment Bill, passed by the State Assembly on August 2, 2019, brought hookah bars within the ambit of the Act of 2003 regulating the trade, production and supply of tobacco products. Assembly Speaker C.P. Joshi informed the House on Friday that the President had assented to the Bill.

The State government had also imposed a ban on e-cigarettes and prohibited the sale of ‘paan masala’ containing nicotine, magnesium carbonate and mineral oil last year. The tobacco control programmes launched in the State were included among the best initiatives in the country, for which a presentation was made at a national summit in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, in November last year.

“single largest barrier”

Voluntary groups which have undertaken a sustained campaign for tobacco control for the last four years said on Monday that surrogate advertising, with the endorsement by film actors and celebrities, was indirectly promoting cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol under the guise of other products.

The tobacco industry was the “single largest barrier” to effective implementation of tobacco control policies, according to health activists.

Jayesh Joshi, secretary of Banswara-based Vaagdhara group, said one of the techniques of surrogate advertising was the display of hoardings and billboards with the pictures of mouth fresheners, ‘elaichi’ and paan masala at prominent places in the cities. This type of indirect advertising was a ploy to deceive the law enforcement authorities, he said.

The groups made a reference to the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, to which India is a party, laying down that there should not be any interference and influence of the tobacco industry on public health policies of the State. Mr. Joshi said the tobacco industry should be held responsible for the tobacco menace in Rajasthan, where a large number of people had died of mouth cancer.

Indian Asthma Care Society secretary Dharamveer Katewa said the State government should come out of the shadows of tobacco industry and implement the laws in accordance with the WHO convention.

The voluntary groups once again called for enforcement of a vendor licensing mechanism to control and regulate the sale of tobacco products.

Licensing policy

The State government had authorised municipal bodies in 2018 to regulate the sale of tobacco products. Since the Global Adult Tobacco Survey 2016-17 has found 24.7 % of adults in Rajasthan as tobacco users, the licensing policy’s formulation will save healthcare costs, increase labour productivity and reduce human suffering.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/call-for-ban-on-surrogate-tobacco-advertising/article30669107.ece

Kapoor, a Panipat based RTI activist.

Salaries, allowances

The annual budget of the SIC has increased 35 times to ₹8.75 crore from ₹25 lakh over the past 14 years, but a major share of it, around ₹52.14 crore, was spent on the salaries and allowances of the Information Commissioners and the staff and the other office expenses.

The SIC spent only 0.03 % of the total budget so far, which comes around ₹1.59 lakh, on holding five programmes, three in Panchkula and one each in Hisar and Kurukshetra, from 2009-2011 to create awareness on the law.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/60-of-haryana-rti-pleas-on-police-dept/article30669089.ece

204,2020/01/27,"President’s Rule in ‘rebel’ States not beyond this govt., says Sinha","Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha on Monday did not rule out the possibility of the Union government enforcing President’s Rule in the States ruled by Opposition parties if they refused to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) for a long period.

“Pagal log hain, kuch bhi kar sakte hai [they are mad people, they can do anything],” Mr. Sinha told reporters here at a joint press conference with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav.

While pointing out the opinion of experts that as per constitutional position, the States could not defy the Centre’s law, he said “full cooperation” of the States was required to implement anything.

Mr. Sinha said if the Centre issued instructions to the State governments to implement the law but they sat on it, for say six months or two years, “the only instrument the government” has is Article 356 of the Constitution, President’s rule. The situation has led to a state of “constitutional crisis”, he said.

Mr. Sinha, who was in Lucknow as part of his nationwide Gandhi Peace March, slammed the BJP government for not reaching out to people who are “in fear” and protesting against the CAA and proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Calling the NRC in Assam a “botched up exercise”, he said that despite the experience in the State, Union Home Minister Amit Shah announced on the floor of Parliament that there would be a nationwide NRC, without any estimation of the costs and machinery required for it.

He listed three reasons for opposing the CAA. First, he argued, the Act went against the “basic structure of the Constitution”. Second, it was not required, he said, arguing that the government already had the power to grant citizenship to anybody it wished as per the original law. Third, the “language used in the law” by the government would make it hard to be implemented. “Maybe, their intent is not to implement it but to mislead people,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rhroxt/article30669061.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27-YASHWANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/presidents-rule-in-rebel-states-not-beyond-this-govt-says-sinha/article30669062.ece
205,2020/01/27,AMU students continue to boycott their exams,"Aligarh Muslim University students continued to boycott exams on Monday, demanding resignation of the Vice-Chancellor and the Registrar. The students have been protesting against the police action of December 15.

“According to the new schedule, the exams were supposed to start in the Engineering Faculty on Monday but a group of students who are protesting against the CAA-NRC forced students not to take the exam. Right now, only Monday’s paper has been rescheduled as we are trying to convince the students to appear in exams and continue with their protests simultaneously,” said a university spokesperson.

“If the exams are further rescheduled, it is going to affect those who are to sit for the engineering entrance exams,” he added.

Release of Faraz

One of the reasons for rescheduling the Monday exam was that students were protesting till the early hours of the day for the release of Mujtaba Faraz.

Mr. Faraz, arrested on Sunday under Section 151 of CrPC for heckling the V-C during his Republic Day speech, was released on Monday around noon.

Interestingly, Mr. Faraz was being described by the university administration as an outsider, but on Monday, two university teachers took his surety after which he was released.

Muted stand on Sharjeel

In a related development, the protesting students have taken a muted stand on Sharjeel Imam, who has been booked for allegedly making a seditious speech in AMU on January 16.

“A section of students feel that it was not seditious while others feel it was.

207,2020/01/27,Police team searches for JNU student Sharjeel Imam in Patna,"A day after a police team searched the ancestral house of Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam at Kako in Jehanabad, Bihar, and questioned some of his relatives, the team on Monday searched for him in Patna’s Muslim-dominated Subzibagh area where an anti-CAA-NRC-NPR protest has been on for several weeks.

Speaking to journalists at Kako, Sharjeel’s mother said her son was innocent and “his comments are being misconstrued”.

“We have not brought up our sons like this… they can never ever say anything against the country… we have been born and brought up here… where we would go from this place,” she said.

Asked why he was absconding, she added, “Because of the situation… definitely, I will ask Sharjeel to come before authorities and explain his words to them.”

Sharjeel’s uncle Irshad Imam said, “It is for taking mileage in the Delhi Assembly election that Sharjeel’s comment is being misinterpreted and he is being hounded… out of his 40-minute video, only four seconds are being shown to accuse him. Is this fair to accuse someone anti-national?”

Case filed in Arunachal

Meanwhile, the Arunachal Pradesh police have filed a case against Sharjeel Imam for “spewing venom” against the northeastern States.

Superintendent of Police of the Special Branch Navdeep Singh Brar said the case was registered under the Indian Penal Code at the Crime Branch police station in the capital Itangar on Sunday.

Sharjeel’s father Akbar Imam, who is no more, had contested the November 2005 Assembly elections on the JD(U) ticket from Jehanabad. He lost the poll narrowly by 447 votes against RJD candidate S.N. Yadav. Locals said the family is well educated and respected in Kako and Sharjeel is said to be a bright student since childhood. He has done his Masters in Computer Science from IIT-Mumbai.

Earlier on Sunday, Sharjeel’s ancestral house at Kako in Jehanabad was raided and some of his relatives were interrogated for his whereabouts. But, Sharjeel was not found. “His last phone tower connection was found in Patna so the Central agency team had come here to look for Sharjeel,” said a senior police official.

‘No one held’

Jehanabad Superintendent of Police Manish Kumar on Sunday said a team of Central agencies had sought support from the local police to conduct raid at Sharjeel’s house and two persons were interrogated but, later they were let free… no one was arrested or detained.” Mr. Kumar refused to give any more details saying, “Since the FIR against Sharjeel is not lodged here, we cannot say much on it… we just cooperated with the Central agencies.”

Like other districts in Bihar, in Jehanabad too, anti-CAA-NRC-NPR protest has been going on for over 10 days near Arwal Mor in the town.

208,2020/01/27,Maoists on the backfoot in remote Swabhiman Anchal in Odisha,"With many villagers starting to resist Maoist opposition to developmental work including road construction, the ultras have started to lose support and are on the backfoot in the remote Swabhiman Anchal of Odisha’s Malkangiri district.

On January 25 night, one armed Maoist was killed and another was seriously injured when inhabitants of Janturai village of the Jodambo panchayat bravely retaliated in self-defence against a group of armed Maoists, who had come to terrorise the villagers asking them to oppose the road construction in their area. The enraged Maoists torched over 10 houses at Jodambo on Sunday morning. For the safety of the villagers who have parted ways with the Maoists, security has been enhanced in the area. Victims of the Maoist arson have been rehabilitated and the administration has declared compensation for their loss.

Lack of road communication with mainland Odisha kept Swabhiman Anchal, the erstwhile cut-off area of the Balimela reservoir, underdeveloped. Proximity with the Maoist-prone regions of adjoining Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh had made it a safe haven of Naxalites for decades.

The Gurupriya bridge connected this cut-off area with the mainland in 2018. The State government initiated a special package for the development of Swabhiman Anchal that included laying roads to connect around 150 remote villages as well as projects to provide basic amenities. Enhancement of road communication has increased area domination and penetration of security personnel to facilitate road construction and developmental projects.

The people, deprived of the benefits of the projects of the government, have now realised that the Maoists are the stumbling blocks for their development. “These villagers now feel that after 70 years of Independence they should no more use mules for their transportation only because the Maoists oppose road connectivity,” said DIG, south-west range, Shefeen Ahmed K.

The recent establishment of a camp of security personnel at Hantalguda has also facilitated the public delivery system in this remote region. It has turned the sentiments of the villagers against the Maoist cadres and their ‘illogical’ anti-development propaganda. “The villagers of Jodambo, Badapada, Paparmetla panchayats, who were traditionally supporting Maoists out of fear, have started to realise the importance of being part of the mainstream after a series of government initiatives,” said Malkangiri SP Khilari Rishikesh Dnyandeo.

A joint operation named “Operation Swabhiman” was taken up for ghat cutting work of around 9 km from Hantalguda to Jodambo, which will further increase road connectivity. The twin strategy of presence of security forces and development is hoped to bring past supporters of the Maoists too into the mainstream.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maoists-on-the-backfoot-in-remote-swabhiman-anchal-in-odisha/article30667616.ece
209,2020/01/27,Analysis | Several obstacles on the political front in Jammu and Kashmir,"This January 26, the government of India announced that it was awarding the Padma Bhushan, one of India’s highest civilian honours, to People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leader Muzaffar Baig. A month before that, a group of eight PDP leaders, led by Altaf Bukhari, spoke of the need for a “new political formation” in Jammu and Kashmir. The eight leaders were expelled from the PDP as they also met a group of visiting diplomats last month.

While the two events seem to indicate that there may be some effort to shore up whatever middle ground there remains in Jammu and Kashmir on the political front, it comes up against several obstacles from the get go.

The first big question to tackle is the one of political legitimacy. The continued incarceration of three former Chief Ministers - Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq and Omar Abdullah - apart from several other political leaders and activists hardly provides ground for any meaningful political engagement at this point. Those wishing to engage in political activity will have to first deal with the existing political parties and their cadre and support base, who will be loath to come out in support for a new formation while political leaders are still in jail. Any political activity without the release of these leaders, at the same time endorsed by New Delhi, will have to take into account that it will be viewed with a move from the Centre and not a spontaneous upsurge.

Quite apart from the rather diffused process through which political legitimacy is constructed, the purely administrative task of delimitation of Assembly constituencies, required as Jammu and Kashmir is now a Union Territory bereft of Ladakh and has a new Assembly provided under the States Reorganisation Act, has seen no forward movement till date. The delimitation exercise, even if it is undertaken within the next month by the Election Commission (no indication that it would be so, however) will take at least a year to be concluded satisfactorily and for polls then to take place.

Within this conundrum of administrative asks and questions of political legitimacy, the BJP is itself facing some anger from its Jammu unit. The party has a large support base in Jammu and feels that it has not been able to leverage the political dividends of reading down Article 370, a key ideological goal of the BJP because of no forward movement on just when the Assembly polls will be held. Jammu’s old plaint, that its own political character was dominated by events in the Kashmir Valley, still stands.

So for those watching Mr. Bukhari’s moves or the Padma for Mr. Baig as political tea leaves for what lies ahead, these are stand alone events, with the long game of political engagement at least 18 months away.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/klmx0/article30666960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BUKHARIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/analysis-several-obstacles-on-political-front-in-jammu-and-kashmir/article30666961.ece
210,2020/01/27,Row over dropping ‘Sher-e-Kashmir’: NC alleges vendetta,"The National Conference (NC) on January 27 took strong exception to the dropping of words ‘Sher-e-Kashmir’, an epithet used for the party founder Sheikh Abdullah, from the nomenclature of Jammu and Kashmir police medals.

The party, whose top leaders are in detention since the scrapping of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5 last year, alleged that the administration was taking its “vendetta to a higher level” and distorting history with this move.

“It is a calibrated effort to trim every single symbol of J-K’s political individuality. The present ruling dispensation in New Delhi, heaving with subjective prejudices and complexes against ideals revolving around the Indian Constitution and the spirit of its accommodative federalism, hasn’t ceased its witch-hunt against everything recognizable with Sheikh Muhammad Abdullah,” district president of the party Peer Afaq Ahmad alleged in a statement.

He said the step should be seen as yet another glaring attempt “aimed at distorting J-K’s history”

“His (Abdullah’s) persona is above petty recognitions, and awards. A conscious leader, he preached to his countrymen to overcome timidity and prejudices,” Mr. Ahmad said, adding his vision of J&K was shorn of regional and religious prejudices.

He claimed the present ruling dispensation “still fears a leader, who has physically left the world three decades back”.

NC spokesman Imran Nani Far also criticised BJP leader Nirmal Singh’s reported remarks against Sheikh Abdullah.

The Jammu and Kashmir administration had on January 26 announced the change in nomenclature of police medal for gallantry and police medal for meritorious service

Principal Secretary, Home Department, Shaleen Kabra, in an order, had said that ‘Sher-e-Kashmir police medal for gallantry and Sher-e-Kashmir police medal for meritorious service’ shall henceforth be read as ‘Jammu and Kashmir police medal for gallantry and Jammu and Kashmir police medal for meritorious service’.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xj0x2o/article30666271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHEIKHABDULLAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/row-over-dropping-sher-e-kashmir-nc-alleges-vendetta-attempt-to-distort-history/article30666272.ece
211,2020/01/27,"Bodo Accord will usher in a new dawn of peace, harmony and togetherness: PM Modi","Hailing the accord signed with Bodo groups on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it would usher in a new dawn of peace, harmony and togetherness and that those associated with armed resistance groups would now enter the mainstream and contribute to the nation’s progress.

He said the accord will lead to transformative results for Bodos as it successfully brings together leading stakeholders under one framework and would help Bodo people get access to development-oriented initiatives.

“Ushering in a new dawn of peace, harmony and togetherness! Today is a very special day for India. The Accord with Bodo groups, which has been inked today will lead to transformative results for the Bodo people,” the Prime Minister tweeted on Twitter.

He said the Accord stands out for many reasons as it successfully brings together the leading stakeholders under one framework.

“Those who were previously associated with armed resistance groups will now be entering the mainstream and contributing to our nation’s progress,” he said.

In a series of tweets, the Prime Minister said the accord with Bodo groups will further protect and popularise the unique culture of the Bodo people.

“They will get access to a wide range of development oriented initiatives. We are committed to doing everything possible to help the Bodo people realise their aspirations,” he said.

The government on Monday signed an accord with the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB), one of the dreaded insurgent groups of Assam, providing political and economic bonanza sans a separate State or Union Territory.

The All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU), which has been spearheading a movement for a Bodoland State since 1972, and another group called United Bodo People’s Organisation were also signatories to the accord.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p966um/article30658284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bodo-accord-will-usher-in-a-new-dawn-of-peace-harmony-and-togetherness-pm-modi/article30666053.ece
212,2020/01/27,"Govt signs accord with NDFB, ABSU to resolve Bodo issue","The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the Assam government and the Bodo groups on Monday signed an agreement to redraw and rename the Bodoland Territorial Area District (BTAD) in Assam, currently spread over four districts of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri.

As per the agreement, villages dominated by Bodos that were presently outside the BTAD would be included and those with non-Bodo population would be excluded, Assam Finance Minister Hemanta Biswa Sarma said. Bodos living in the hills would be conferred a Scheduled Hill Tribe status, he noted.

Mr. Sarma asserted that as of now the agreement had not addressed the issue of “citizenship or work permit” for non-domiciles in the BTAD, to be renamed as the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR).

Several Bodo groups led by the All Bodo Students Union (ABSU) have been demanding a separate land for the ethnic community since 1972, a movement that has claimed nearly 4,000 lives.

Pact will end crisis: Shah

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who presided over the event, said the signing of the agreement would “end the 50-year-old Bodo crisis.”

“Today, Assam is united. Around 1500 cadres of NDFB(P), NDFB(RD) and NDFB(S) will be rehabilitated by Centre and Assam Government. They will be assimilated in the mainstream and will surrender on January 30 on Bapu’s death anniversary. No one will be called a militant now, they all are our brothers and sisters,” Mr. Shah said.

The memorandum of settlement says that the criminal cases registered against members of the NDFB factions for “non-heinous” crimes shall be withdrawn by the Assam government and in cases of heinous crimes it will be reviewed. Civilians numbering 2,823, 239 security personnel and 939 Bodo cadres have been killed so far.

Mr. Shah said that the families of those killed during the Bodo movement would get Rs. 5 lakh each. “Final and comprehensive solution to their demands has been made, while retaining the territorial integrity of Assam. After the agreement, the NDFB factions will leave the path of violence, surrender their weapons and disband their armed organisations within a month of signing the deal.” A Special Development Package of Rs. 1500 Crore would be given by the Centre to undertake specific projects for the development of Bodo areas, he added.

When asked if the agreement was Article 370 (revoked from J&K) in a new form since it ensured special status and further autonomy for the Bodos, Mr. Shah said, “Is it your demand that Article 370 should be brought back?""

The signing of the agreement was attended by Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Director of Intelligence Bureau Arvinda Kumar.

Giving the contours of the memorandum, Mr. Sarma said, “A committee will decide the exclusion and inclusion of new areas in the BTAD. Subsequent to this alteration, the total number of Assembly seats will go up to 60, from the existing 40. In this committee, both the representatives of the ABSU as well as the present BTC will be present.” Bodo with Devnagri script would be the associate official language for the entire Assam.

The first Bodo accord was signed with the ABSU in 1993, leading to the creation of a Bodoland Autonomous Council with limited political powers. The BTC was created in 2003 with some more financial and other powers.

The BTAD and other areas mentioned under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution have been exempted from the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, that enables undocumented non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014 to apply for Indian citizenship.

Recently, the MHA and the Assam government signed a suspension of operations (SoO) agreement with the NDFB-S, led by its chairman B Saoraigwra, Around 40 members of the NDFB, including Mr. Saoraigwra, were brought back from Myanmar on January 11.

The other faction of the NDFB, led by IK Songbijit, who was expelled from the group, is not a signatory to this pact. The NDFB (S) has been involved in several incidents in Assam, including the December 2014 one in which 76 persons were killed.

The blockade, which started on Sunday evening, continued till 2 a.m. and the University cancelled an exam scheduled for Monday in view of the situation, the official said.

AMU Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor was on Sunday heckled by a group of students during his Republic Day speech here soon after he termed as “unfortunate” the recent happenings on the campus and said peaceful protests will be allowed on any issue within the ambit of law.

Four students identified as Tahir Azmi, Rafiuddin, Sudhir Gulati and A Mujtaba Faraz, who were involved in the heckling, were handed over to police. In the afternoon, a group of protesters collected at the gate of the AMU Proctor’s office demanding the release of the four.

Three students were later released by the police. AMU Proctor Prof Afifullah Khan, said three students had been released whereas Faraz was sent to jail.

As the news spread in the campus, huge crowds of protesters started collecting near the Purani Chungi gate of the University and blocked the Aligarh-Moradabad Highway.

In view of the protests, exams of the AMU Engineering College were cancelled on Monday.

AMU Proctor, Prof Afifullah Khan told PTI, “The examinations which were to be held at the AMU Engineering College on Monday could not be held as a large number of protesters collected at the gates of the Zakir Hussain College of Engineering.

Referring to the students’ demand for the release of Faraz, the Proctor said a group of teachers and top university officials have met senior district officials and, We are hopeful that Faraz will be out on bail .

214,2020/01/27,West Bengal Assembly passes resolution against CAA,"The West Bengal Legislative Assembly on Monday passed a resolution urging the Union government to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The resolution, moved by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee under Rule 169 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the Assembly, was passed unanimously by the House, with Congress and Left members, along with those of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC), supporting it. The BJP opposed it.

The resolution noted that since the CAA was passed there was violence in “almost every State.” In the CAA, “religion has been used as a yardstick to measure eligibility to apply for Indian citizenship” and “the ruling party in the Centre has been driving a wedge among the people using religion [thus] damaging human rights,” it said.

The resolution criticised the Centre for issuing a notice to conduct a National Population Register (NPR) and a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) “without clear guidelines”, creating “panic among people”. It pointed out that on July 31, 2018, the State Assembly passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of the NRC in Assam, and followed it with another resolution on September 6, 2019 that opposed NRC in West Bengal.

“This House has been informed by the news media that the Prime Minister has informed that the CAA will not be used to take away anyone’s right to citizenship. However, [this information] has not been mentioned in the CAA, which has created confusion,” the Monday resolution said.

A humanity issue: Mamata

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee described the CAA as something that was against the spirit of the Constitution and demanded its repeal. “It is not a small Hindu Muslim issue...the issue is of humanity...this law is a shame on humanity.” The BJP was trying to do some experiments based on their party manifesto and it did not care about the country, she alleged.

Ms. Banerjee said the Left and Congress MLAs should not raise slogans comparing her with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Modi and Didi are not same. This slogan will get back to you as a boomerang…[Our] votes were not transferred to the BJP, it was your votes. This is not the time to fight among us, but fight against dictatorship”.

The CAA, the NPR and the NRC were all the part of the same plan. “We will not accept CAA, NPR and NRC”. People were living in fear and queuing up for all kinds of certificate. The BJP was immersed in politics of hatred and that was the reason why everyone in the Assembly was opposing the resolution except three or four (BJP) members. “You [BJP] can continue with your politics of vendetta. We are ready to fight the BJP politically on this,” the Chief Minister said.

Fight BJP jointly, says Mannan

Leader of the Opposition Abdul Mannan welcomed the resolution and referred to the unprecedented security arrangements in the city when the Prime Minister visited Kolkata earlier this month. The anger of people was so much that he had to travel by air and water and avoided roads. Political parties opposed to fascist policies should leave small differences and join the fight against BJP. To fight Hitler, Stalin and Churchill had to come together, he added.

Leader of the Left Legislature Party Sujan Chakraborty, while supporting the resolution, said the CAA was not only anti-Muslim but anti-poor also. He spoke about the protests in the country against the CAA. The new law had sullied the image of the country in global platform. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) MLA suggested that the State government start the practice of reading the preamble of the Constitution in schools.

A similar proposal was made by Mr. Mannan.

BJP MLA Swadhin Sarkar thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah for passing the resolution. Opposing the resolution, Mr. Sarkar referred to the violence in certain parts of the State while opposing the Act. The CAA would not have any affect on the existing citizens of the country, he pointed out.

All India Forward Bloc member Ali Imran Ramz said the TMC accepted the proposal of Opposition parties brought earlier this year that Bengal would have been “the first or second to pass the resolution but now the State is fourth to pass the resolution”. He described the NPR as the first step towards a nationwide NRC, and urged the Chief Minister not to suspend the NPR exercise for time being but completely reject it.

Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) MLA Rohit Sharma supported the resolution,saying the CAA was a foul cry of turning a “secular India into Hindu rashtra”.

Superintendent of Police of the Special Branch Navdeep Singh Brar said the case was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code at the Crime Branch police station in State capital Itangar on Sunday.

“We acted on inputs regarding the circulation of a viral video on social media platforms inciting secession of Assam and other northeastern States, including Arunachal Pradesh, from the rest of the country for creating communal disharmony and hampering the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of India,” he told The Hindu on Monday.

A special investigation team had taken up the case and the contents of the video would be sent to a forensic laboratory for collecting scientific evidence, he said. Efforts were on to track those who made, uploaded and circulated the video.

On Sunday, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu tweeted: “This kind of provocation inciting secession of Assam & other NE states... will not be tolerated.”

On January 25, the Assam police filed a sedition case against Mr. Imam under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act read with relevant sections of the IPC. This followed Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma’s announcement that a criminal case would be filed against him for “instigating people to cut off Assam for at least two-three months, if not forever”.

Mr. Imam, a former Jawaharlal Nehru University student, purportedly said Bengali Hindus and Muslims were being killed in Assam through the National Population Register and the CAA.

The families of victims have been sheltered and provided security by the police, said Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of police, south-west range Shefeen Ahmed K. It is alleged that Maoists have kidnapped two men and a woman from Jodamba. Security forces have started a massive combing operation in the region.

The incident at Janturai village is first of its kind in Malkangiri district. According to Malkangiri Superintendent of Police Khilari Rishikesh Dnyandeo, on Saturday night around 20 to 25 armed Maoists and their supporters reached Janturai to threaten the villagers to oppose developmental works including road construction as well as not to celebrate Republic Day. It led to an altercation between Maoists and villagers. Maoists tried to target some Janturai inhabitants and even fired from their guns to terrorise the villagers.

Shot arrows

To save their lives, the villagers retaliated by pelting stones and also shot arrows at the ultras. Naxalites had never expected such brave retaliation and preferred to escape from the spot. But two of them were seriously injured who could not escape out. One of them succumbed to injuries, while the other was arrested by police.

“This incident hints that inhabitants of Swabhiman Anchal, who after remaining cut off by the Balimela reservoir till 2018, now want development and basic amenities. The villagers are frustrated with the activities of Maoists, who have become an obstacle in the path of development of their area,” said Mr. Shefeen. Swabhiman Anchal got direct road connectivity to mainland Odisha through the Gurupriya bridge. It was a major Maoist stronghold. Gurupriya bridge has increased penetration of security personnel in the area. At present, roads are being laid to connect its interior villages, which is opposed by Maoists.

Exchange of fire

In another development, an exchange of fire occurred between the Maoists and security forces in the Ambadhani jungle between Lekhapadar and Dangamati in Rayagada district on Sunday. Combing operation is still continues in the area and there were no reports of any casualty or injury. On January 12, Maoists resorted to arson at a construction firm involved in the PMGSY road construction work in this area.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maoist-killed-as-odisha-villagers-in-swabhiman-anchal-retaliate/article30661349.ece

Three seats were won by Left-leaning student outfits and the NSUI, while one seat went to an independent candidate. All the five candidates fielded by the ABVP lost.

Elections for all five seats were held on Friday.

The Birsa Ambedkar Phule Students’ Association, the Students’ Federation of India and the Left Democratic Students Federation won one seat each and the NSUI, the student wing of the Congress, bagged one.

Of the eleven schools in the University, elections were held at five – the School of Languages, International Relations, Library Science, Environmental and Social Science.

Of the eleven schools in the University, elections were held at five – School of Languages, School of International Studies, School of Library and Information Science, School of Environment and Sustainable Development, and School of Social Sciences.

Following its drubbing at the hustings, the ABVP in a statement alleged that the University violated its own norms to help Left-leaning students win the election.

According to the ABVP, as per the rules, the varsity was supposed to keep classes closed during voting on January 22. However, the laboratory and other facilities were functioning, which prevented students from voting and taking part in the electoral process.

Meanwhile, in a separate statement, ABVP State functionary Himalaya Singh Jhala also claimed that the ABVP had already won five seats uncontested in the Central University of Gujarat.

“Despite the continuous illegal interference by the Left faculty in the Central University of Gujarat, the ABVP has won five seats in the student council election,” he added.

“At the same time, the Left coalition and Congress student organisations [NSUI, SFI, DISF, BAPSA] contested jointly and the entire coalition was also able to find candidates for only six seats, while the ABVP contested 10 seats and won five” Mr. Jhala said, adding that the ABVP has representation from every Department in the Central University of Gujarat and has emerged as the single largest student organisation in the varsity.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/abvp-loses-elections-in-gujarats-central-university/article30661292.ece

Governor Ganeshi Lal hoisted the tri-colour and took the salute at the State level celebration held at Mahatma Gandhi Marg. A total of 48 contingents took part in the parade and seven tableaus, showcasing the achievements of different organisations, were presented.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, who usually hoists the flag at Cuttack, chose to witness the celebration from the spectators’ enclosure. Mr. Patnaik, however, paid tribute to freedom fighters in a video message.

219,2020/01/27,"Father, daughter duo gets Padma Shri for 30-year-long conservation experiment","Radha Mohan, a retired economics professor and his conservationist daughter, Sabarmatee, have been conferred with the Padma Shri – a recognition for their decades-long efforts to transform a barren land into a lush food forest in Odisha’s Nayagarh district.

Founded by the duo in 1990, Sambhav, the resource centre, has become a torch-bearer in the field of conservation, agriculture and organic farming.

“We did not start the centre in the hope of any recognition. We wanted to prove a point how ecology can be restored in a totally degraded land without the use of external inputs including fertilisers and pesticides. We have followed ecological principles only,” said Professor Radha Mohan.

When they landed near Odagaon, 110 km from Bhubaneswar, the land was completely barren. They started using ecological waste to create the top soil and subsequently began planting trees.

As a result, 36 hectares of degraded land now boasts of rare varieties of clove bean, jack bean, black rice and sword bean apart from a number of other food trees. The forest has over 1,000 species of plants and 500 varieties of rice, and supports a seed bank with 700 indigenous varieties of seeds.

While Professor Radha Mohan, a former information commissioner of Odisha, often shuttles between Bhubaneswar and the farm in Nayagarh district, his daughter, Sabarmatee, has been dedicatedly experimenting with different conservation models to improve the lives of the local farmers.

The Padma Shri was also bestowed upon Dayamanti Beshra, a prominent Santhali researcher, for her contribution to the field of education and literature. Hailing from a poor family in Mayurbhanj, Ms. Beshra completed her education mostly on government stipends.

The writer is one of the leading lights of Santhali literature and her research has contributed to the vanishing tribal language regaining its prominence in the Santhal tribal-dominated regions of the State. Since 2011, she has been publishing Karam Dar, the first Santhali women’s magazine. Ms Beshra was also honoured with the Sahitya Akademi award.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/father-daughter-duo-gets-padma-shri-for-30-year-long-conservation-experiment/article30661226.ece

“The situation is under control now, and we’ll register a case against those who pelted stones and stoked tension. No injuries have been reported,” said B.S. Chouhan, DIG, Jabalpur.

After concluding a tiranga rally in favour of the contentious law on the occasion of the Republic Day, its 500-700 participants began advancing towards another rally against it nearby. Seeing them approaching, its participants got ready for an imminent face-off, he added.

“We barricaded the route 100 metres ahead of the other rally having around 4,000-5,000 persons. But then, some persons from neighbouring streets began pelting stones, and we had to disperse everyone using cannons and tear gas shells,” he said.

“They claimed the anti-CAA group had blocked the roads which was disrupting everyday life,” Bharat Yadav, Collector, told reporters. “We told them even they had permission until today, they will be convinced to clear the roads.”

Stating that no such permissions which disrupted the traffic flow would be granted, he said, “School examinations are forthcoming and such blocking of roads affects administrative work. Permission to submit memorandums may be granted.”

While prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were in force in the area, both the rallies had permission from the police.

It urged the government to take immediate action to penalise the perpetrators of violence against students.

The MLA Executive Council condemned the physical assaults on those who have exercised their “rights of assembly and dissent” in opposing the CAA. “These protests question new steps that allow state discrimination against citizens purely on the basis of religion and thus contravene India’s own constitutional commitment to secularism,” said the statement. “The Indian government has responded to protests against the Act with unprecedented violence on campuses and in the public sphere and routinely criminalises the assembly of five or more people in order to sanction its brutality in suppressing the protests.”

The MLA called for “the immediate cessation of sanctioned violence on campus in India and the assault on the democratic principles of equality, freedom, and the right to espouse viewpoints without fear of reprisal.” It urged the government to protect academic freedom and create stable conditions for open dialogue on any proposed changes in the university and on State policy, citizenship, immigration and Assembly.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/international-academic-body-condemns-violence-on-campuses/article30660784.ece

Mr. Ghosh, 52, had unsuccessfully contested the 2013 Assembly elections from Ramnagar in Agartala. He later joined the Congress after being expelled from the BJP for allegedly indulging in anti-party activities.

Police said his wife and few neighbours took the advocate to the hospital after he reportedly fell unconscious at his chamber at Krishnanagar. He was bleeding from nose when he was taken to hospital and doctors suspected cardiac arrest as the reason for his death, the police said.

The lawyer’s father-in-law complained that his son-in-law was murdered and the police should probe in that angle. He claimed that a relative of Mr. Ghosh, Sukanta Sen, had borrowed ₹15 lakh from the lawyer and he suspected the latter for ‘organising the murder’.

A police officer said they were waiting for the post-mortem report to know the cause of death.

223,2020/01/27,Haryana CM sells ‘old’ school project,"Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal at a function here over the weekend suggested that the management committees of private schools should adopt government schools in their neighbourhood.

But a similar project launched in his own constituency had sank without a trace five years ago because of alleged lack of coordination and apathy of the government officials.

As per the official press statement, Mr. Lal in his address at the function to lay the foundation stone of a school building in Dhankot village on Saturday claimed that private schools in Karnal had adopted 50 government schools, but District Education Officer Ravinder Chaudhary, when contacted, said he had no information about any such programme being run in the district.

“It usually takes a few days for the information to reach us. It must be at the higher administrative level. I have no clue about it,” said Mr. Chaudhary.

Rajan Lamba, president of Sahodaya Schools Complex Karnal, an association of the CBSE-affiliated schools of the district, told The Hindu over phone that around a dozen private schools in Karnal had adopted a few government schools in their neigbourhood soon after the Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in October 2014 at the behest of Mr. Lal, but the project failed within six months.

“Exhorted by the Chief Minister, the management of around a dozen schools came forward to work in tandem with the government schools in their neighbourhood. But it failed to work because of a host of factors. We offered our playgrounds, laboratories and even staff to help the government schools, but the principals of these schools mistook it for an interference in their functioning and never co-operated,” said Dr. Lamba.

He said that almost after six months of efforts, the private schools slowly withdrew themselves from the programme.

‘No mechanism’

Dr. Lamba, also principal of Tagore Bal Niketan School, said there was no mechanism for the feedback, no recognition for the good work done by the private schools and no one in the administration would listen to them.

“The government schools have more qualified and better paid staff than private institutes.

In his speech on the 71st Republic Day, Capt. Amarinder asserted that the secular foundations of India’s Constitution would continue to stand firm as he unfurled the tricolour, and also took the salute at a colourful parade in Mohali.

Emphasising the need for quality and more relevant education, Captain Amarinder announced that 19 new IITs would be established in the State, along with new medical colleges at Mohali, Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur.

The Chief Minister reiterated his government’s commitment to farmer welfare. “Farmers have earned ₹44,000 crore more in the last six seasons of our government as compared to the corresponding period of the previous government, as a result of steps to ensure smooth procurement, check on exploitation of farmers and streamlining of transport and labour operations,” he said.

225,2020/01/27,Anti-CAA resolutions are a political statement: Tharoor,"Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor on Sunday said the resolutions against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, passed by several State Assemblies recently, were a “political statement” through which they had conveyed their apprehensions about the Centre’s intent behind linking nationality with religion. “The States want the Union government to know of their unhappiness,” he said.

Interacting with journalists at the Jaipur Literature Festival here, Mr. Tharoor said the Centre should listen to the views of the States, as it would need their cooperation if it wanted to move forward from the CAA for preparing the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“What will the Centre do if the States refuse to make their employees available for enumeration? The idea of mentioning dubious citizenship against names in the proposed NRC is purely the BJP’s creation... It is rightly being opposed,” Mr. Tharoor, a former Union Minister, said.

The Thiruvananthapuram MP asserted that Pakistan founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s victory would be completed if the CAA led to NPR and NRC in which large sections of population would be deprived of their rights if they failed to prove their citizenship. “A choice between Jinnah’s idea of the nation and Mahatma Gandhi’s idea is still available to us. The BJP is justifying Jinnah's logic through CAA.”

Later, three students — Siddharth Gulati and Tahir Azmi of the Faculty of Engineering and Rafiuddin of the Faculty of Arts — were released, but Mujtaba Faraz was arrested.

Aligarh Senior Superintendent of Police Akash Kulhary said Mr. Faraz was not a student of AMU and hence was arrested for violating prohibitory orders and disturbing peace. The students were handed over to the police by the proctorial team of AMU.

Demanding the release of Mr. Faraz, students came out of the campus and blocked the road near Chungi Chauraha, leading to a possible confrontation with the police. Mr Kulhary said they were in touch with the university administration but refused to comment on the possible action against the students. Till late evening, a group of students was negotiating with the district administration for Mr. Faraz’s release.

“Mr. Faraz completed his post-graduation last year and has applied for Ph.D. The university administration is trying to scuttle the peaceful protest by bringing out minor technical issues,” said a student, requesting anonymity. University officials refused to come on record but a source close to the administration alleged that Mr. Faraz had a criminal record.

Ansab Aamir, a student of the Engineering Faculty, said the students raised slogans when the V-C began his speech at the Strachey Hall. “Standing in the last row, they were chanting ‘V-C go back’ and showing placards, demanding his resignation. Soon, the proctor team came and took them away,” said Mr. Aamir.

‘Ironic situation’

He said it was ironic that on one hand, the V-C said in his speech that the university was committed to allowing peaceful protest on any issue within the ambit of law and on the other, he not only allowed protesting students to be roughly picked up by the proctorial team but also hand them over to the police.

232,2020/01/27,Elephant calf separated from herd harassed,"An 8-month-old elephant calf that got separated from its herd is being taunted by youth of the villages on the fringes of the Sanamavu reserve forest here. Even as the videos shot by the locals showed a heckling, chasing and taunting by local youth surrounding the agitated calf, the forest department has stepped back waiting to act.

A few days ago, the calf that had lost it's way, straying off from its herd was tranquillized and let off into the forests by the forest department that had claimed that the calf would rejoin its herd. However, the calf that was evidently not let off deep enough inside the forest to enable it to find the herd was seen back outside the forest fringes. Over the last week, the calf was found straying back outside Sanamavu.

Even as videos showing an unruly youth chasing after the agitated calf pushing it to provocation, the department had not stepped in to warn the local youth, or initiated any action.

No efforts were made to guide the calf back into the forests. When contacted, Seetharaman, forest ranger, Hosur said, “these were patta lands and the public cannot be controlled as it was likely to lead to law and order issue. We are constrained. But our staff are monitoring the calf and will soon guide it back to the forests.”

The calf had been returning frequently for the past few days. But, the animal cannot be relocated and will have rejoin its herd, says Seetharaman.

According to the forester Kaliappan, the public action was violative despite ‘awareness given to the villages surrounding Sanamavu RF’. “We hope to send the calf back inside in two days,” Kaliappan told The Hindu.

The forest department, as have repeated incidents of human-animal conflict has shown, is blasé about reckless public behaviour that has often hindered rescue processes, where elephants have been endangered by accidents, say forest officials.

The carcass of the leopard was found in a tea estate at Vellamalai on Saturday. It was found around 200 metre away from a reserve forest area coming under Akkamalai beat of Valparai forest range. Workers, who went to that part of the estate to pluck tea leaves on Saturday morning, found the carcass and informed the Forest Department.

A.S. Marimuthu, Deputy Field Director of Anamalai Tiger Reserve under which the area falls, said that the carcass was autopsied on Sunday.

“Autopsy findings suggested that the leopard could have been injured in a fight with another leopard which is highly possible as it is a territorial animal. Such fights also occur when two males fight for a female for mating. The animal was young and it could have had a fatal fight with a bigger cat,” he said.

It was also found that the leopard had preyed on a Nilgiri langur, remains of which was found in its stomach in the autopsy.

234,2020/01/27,Tiruppur Collector assures action against RI,"Following complaints of a Revenue Inspector (RI) allegedly threatening a Village Administrative Officer (VAO) for seizing two trucks transporting sand, District Collector K. Vijayakarthikeyan assured action here on Monday.

“It is still under investigation. After investigating, the District Revenue Officer will definitely take action,” he told reporters. Mr. Vijayakarthikeyan also asserted that strict action would be taken against any officials charged with corrupt activities.

An audio clip of the conversation, which was said to be between Palladam RI Eswari and the VAO of Kattur Village Panchayat (Pongalur Block), has gone viral on social media platforms since Monday. In the alleged clip, the RI was heard admonishing the VAO for seizing two trucks which were allegedly transporting sand. While the RI was heard saying that the lorries were seized because they did not carry necessary permits, the RI was heard urging the VAO to release the trucks.

A senior official from Revenue Department said that a show-cause notice has been served on the RI and an inquiry would be conducted into this issue.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tiruppur-collector-assures-action-against-ri/article30669094.ece
235,2020/01/27,Lessons from Rajasthan; Pichwai workshop by Kalyanmal Sahu,"Kalyanmal Sahu describes a normal morning back home in Ajmer. “I help my family with the household chores and drop off my grandchildren at school. After that I sit in my room and do Pichwai art. It usually goes on till mid night.” Pichwai is the backdrop usually to idols of Lord Krishna in temples in Rajasthan. Sixty-three-year-old Kalyanmal is a national award winning artist who was invited here to conduct a five-day workshop at PSG College of Technology.

Kalyanmal has been painting for 45 years and he recounts how necessity made him pick up Pichwai. “I had an art-loving neighbour in my village who collected paintings from around the country and took pains to tell us about them. That was also the time when my family was going through financial difficulties and I needed a job. I learnt Pichwai through trial and error and now my children too practise it,” he says. Like it is with so many traditional craft, the demand for Pichwai and awareness about it is dwindling.“The Government does not provide any support to the artists and most of the younger generation is not interested to take it up. It is a sad reality.”

But Kalyanmal has not lost hope as he says he has been travelling the country for the last 10 years holding workshops and classes. “I hope my students will carry the tradition forward.” He says to keep the art relevant, the Pichwai painting technique is now being used on pendants, wall hangings, book covers and more.

Speaking about how he goes about teaching his students, Kalyanmal says he starts with the basics — creating natural colours that are extracted from soil, leaves and soot. He then teaches students to prepare the cloth before the drawing.“It is difficult for beginners to do the work on cloth. So I teach them do it on a piece of paper before. The brush is made from squirrel fur,” he points out.

Kalyanmal uses gold foil too. “The gold dust is very fine and I hold my breath when I work with it. But the results are worth it,” he smiles. He draws the attention of the participants to the traditional elements of a Pichwai. “The human figures will have lotus petal shaped eyes and traditional Rajasthani garments. The painting will also usually have elements associated with river Yamuna — for example the lotus flowers and mango trees on its bank.”",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tkajid/article30664480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WORKSHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/on-pichwai-workshop-by-kalyanmal-sahu-at-coimbatore/article30664481.ece
236,2020/01/27,Myriad art; An exhibition in Coimbatore,"Four professors of Visual Comunication from of Hindusthan College of Arts and Science — A Charles, K Arun Prasath, J Jesen and K Mohamed Faruk — present ‘And I Thought’, an exhibition of their paintings and sculpture. They have experimented with different techniques, forms and drawn from varied inspirations to come up with the collection, they say.

In a work that he calls ‘Depth’, Charles has used the liquid art technique. “It is a difficult process where multiple shades of paint are first added in layers to a bowl before poured on to a canvas. The colours will form a unique pattern as it flows. It takes four days to dry, but I think the wait is worth it.” Another painting has a forest with sunlight seeping through. “I observed this dramatic scene during an art camp in Tiruchirapalli. Right then and there I painted the scene on a canvas in front of my students,” he recalls.

Arun’s works have taken the form of water colour paintings inspired by his train journeys to Goa. “The rural areas that I passed were serene and rich in greenery and water bodies. I clicked photographs which I later painted into my canvas.” Pointing to his painting called the ‘Rapid Transit’ that two boats on a river, he recalls, “I saw villagers getting into these boats with their bags full of things they had bought at the market. They rowed so effortlessly and at such a great speed that I lost sight of them in a few minutes. It is still vivid in my memory,” he says.

For Jesen the South Indian woman is his muse for sculptures. He researched on the styles of jewellery that the women used down the ages. “ An 80-year-old women I met at Tirunelveli told me how she used to stuff little packets filled with mud into the holes in her lobes to make them bigger. That was the fashion then.” He uses clay to form the mould and then sculpts using resin and fibre before painting them a copper colour. “It gives an antique finish that I like,” he says.

Faruk enjoys pencil and watercolour. “For me reproducing something as it is very challenging,” he says. Pointing to his favourite painting of a green bird with long beak, he says, “I am not sure what bird is it. I it online and knew that I had to draw it.

According to S. Jothibasu, a CPI(M) committee member for Sulur taluk who was present at the meeting, panchayat president B. Savithri did not accept the resolution as it was “against the government.” A minor argument broke out during the course of the meeting as the replies to queries were allegedly given by Ms. Savithri’s husband and former panchayat president Shanmugasundaram and not by her, Mr. Jothibasu said.

240,2020/01/27,Work on integrated bus stand begins amid unanswered questions,"On January 24, Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani kick-started the work to construct an integrated bus terminus at Vellalore by participating in the ground-breaking ceremony.

The Coimbatore Corporation, with financial support from the State Government, will construct in the next two years the terminus on 61.62 acre land near its dump yard at ₹ 168 crore.

The State Government took over the project about four months ago after the Central Government attempted to build a bus port under the Bharat Mala scheme. Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had made an announcement in this regard here in December 2017 that the Central Government would fund two bus port projects in the State – one in Salem and another in Coimbatore.

Consequent upon the Central Government’s decision, the Coimbatore Corporation shared with the National Highways the detailed project report it had prepared to construct a new bus stand. After a series of back and forth correspondences, the State Government decided to take over the project by funding 50% of the project cost. The Corporation was to bear the rest.

Sources familiar with the developments said, the National Highways’ queries related to the bus port project were what the Corporation proposed to do with the dump yard, which had around 19 lakh cubic metre accumulated waste, and the expansion of roads around the proposed bus port to ensure easy movement of buses.

As the State Government and the Corporation were insistent on having the bus port at Vellalore and as the National Highways was unhappy with the location, the Government decided to take over the project.

The sources said the Highways was concerned about the width of the Podanur-Chettipalayam Road being inadequate to accommodate the increased bus movement, the absence of wide roads from Vellalore to Singanallur and, similarly, from Vellalore to the Chengapalli-Walayar Bypass Road.

Minister Mr. Velumani, however, said that the Government decided to go ahead with the Corporation's plan to construct the bus terminus at Vellalore because it could not find an alternative land.

Further justifying the decision, he said the waste lying accumulated at the Vellalore yard would not be a problem as the Corporation would soon start processing it, and, the State Government had proposed to construct a grade separator (elevated corridor) from the Chengapalli-Walayar Bypass to the bus terminus.

If the State Government and Corporation had drawn such plans why was it that they were unable to respond satisfactorily to the queries the National Highways had raised, asked Coimbatore Consumer Cause secretary K. Kathirmathiyon.

The land that the Government and Corporation had finalised for the bus terminus would serve no purpose because connecting Vellalore to the city and roads that led to towns nearby would always be a problem.

By constructing the bus terminus at Vellalore, how does the Government or Corporation propose to serve buses from Mettupalayam, Sathyamangalam, Tiruppur or Erode. If the Government or Corporation did not have a plan, it only showed that they have not thought through the bus terminus plan in a comprehensive fashion but were interested only in constructing a new facility.

If buses from Mettupalayam or Sathyamangalam or Ooty were to pass through Gandhipuram to reach Vellalore, how would it ease congestion within the city, something that the Minister and the Corporation had been talking about as the prime objective behind the bus terminus project.

And, if the Government were to order the termination of all buses in Vellalore and introduce additional bus service to city, it would again lead to congestion.

Besides, the commuters would be forced to spend more – from their starting point to Vellalore and from there to the city, Mr. Kathirmathiyon pointed out.

Corporation officials, however, said they were yet to work out such operational details but proposed to do so within the two years it took to construct the terminus. Similarly, the Corporation was yet to talk to the State Highways for widening the approach roads to the terminus.

This was nothing short of the ‘cutting the foot to suit the boot’ approach, the consumer activist quipped. In addition to the location of the Vellalore bus terminus, the absence of proper connectivity, the possibility of commuters paying more, there was another issue that the Corporation seemed to be oblivious to.

The Madras High Court had in an order clearly said that buses to destinations less than 55 km would necessarily have to reach Gandhipuram. How the Corporation planned to get around this and given the others challenges, it seemed to have gone ahead with the bus terminus project without addressing all issues, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/676a67/article30660358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB27-BUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/work-on-integrated-bus-stand-begins-amid-unanswered-questions/article30660359.ece
241,2020/01/27,Student attempts world record with mosaic of national flag,"A college student attempted to enter the Guinness World Records by creating a sticker mosaic art of the national flag using 90,000 square stickers in Tiruppur.

M. Praveen Kumar, a fourth-year B. Arch student at a private university in Eachanari, Coimbatore, displayed the artwork at a private school on Peruntholuvu Road on the occasion of Republic Day.

242,2020/01/27,Ranji Trophy | Belligerent Sarfaraz at it again,"Sarfaraz Khan (226 n.o., 213b, 32x4, 4x6) continued his sensational form with a stellar unbeaten double hundred to bail Mumbai out of trouble on the opening day of the Ranji Trophy Group B match against Himachal Pradesh at the scenic HPCA Stadium on Monday.

Sarfaraz’s belligerent innings, days after his unbeaten 301, along with sensible knocks by captain Aditya Tare (62, 100b, 8x4) and Shubham Ranjane (44 n.o., 75b, 7x4) meant Mumbai not only recovered from a precarious 16 for three but ended the opening day at 372 for five.

After asking Mumbai to bat, the new-ball duo of Abhinay Kanwar and Vaibhav Arora sent back the top-three, but nothing went in Himachal’s favour after that.

Shouldering arms

Arora sent down two charming in-swingers in the fourth over that got the openers — both shouldering arms. Jay Bista was rapped on the pads and Bhupen Lalwani’s off-stump was uprooted.

When Kanwar castled Hardik Tamore, who was late on the ball off a straight one in the next over, Mumbai was in danger of folding up early. But, Sarfaraz took the pressure off a stuttering Siddhesh Lad by taking the attack to the opposition. Once the moisture evaporated, Sarfaraz was into his stride.

Despite losing Lad, Sarfaraz crossed fifty as Mumbai ended the session at 118 for four. The next two sessions saw Sarfaraz literally kill the contest. He raced from 52 to 100 in just half an hour after lunch, with his five fours in a Pankaj Jaswal over being the highlight.

Similarly, despite watching Tare chase a wide one from Raghav Dhawan to be caught behind and end the 143-run partnership, Sarfaraz launched another assault after tea. The bowlers were left clueless as he raced from 132 to 200 off just 43 balls.

Ranjane and Sarfaraz have put on 158 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket off 157 balls.

The scores:

Mumbai — 1st innings: Jay Bista lbw b Arora 12, Bhupen Lalwani b Arora 1, Hardik Tamore lbw b Kanwar 2, Siddhesh Lad b Dhawan 20, Sarfaraz Khan (batting) 226, Aditya Tare c Kalsi b Dhawan 62, Shubham Ranjane (batting) 44; Extras (w-5): 5; Total (for 5 wkts. in 75 overs): 372.

243,2020/01/27,Johannesburg Test | England beat South Africa by 191 runs to take series 3-1,"England bowled South Africa out for 274 runs on Monday to win the fourth Test at The Wanderers by 191 runs and ensure an emphatic 3-1 series victory.

Mark Wood took four wickets as the home team crumbled in the evening session after threatening to offer stoic resistance earlier in the day.

England completed the task with a day to spare with South Africa falling well short of their 466-run target in what would have been the highest fourth innings Test chase.

The success is a massive boost for a young English team who overcame several obstacles on a tough tour and questions over Joe Root's captaincy.

“It took a lot to pick ourselves up after losing the first Test and that's been extremely pleasing. It's taken a big effort from every one and it's a very exciting time for English cricket,” said Root as he took the series trophy.

For South Africa it marked a 108-year low as they lost for the eighth time in their last nine Tests for their worst run since 10 defeats in 11 Tests between 1910 and 1912.

Wood took 4-54 -- finishing with nine wickets in the game -- and Stuart Broad and Ben Stokes added two more for England as they took the last six South African wickets for 39 runs.

The home team were facing a near impossible target of 466 and provided a flicker of resistance but lost wickets at crucial intervals.

“England were better than us in every department with both ball and bat,” said home skipper Faf du Plessis.

“We have to give them credit for being the better team.”

Rassie van der Dussen scored 98, falling agonisingly short of a maiden Test century, before being tricked into offering an easy catch, just five balls after Du Plessis had been bowled by Stokes for 35.

Their 92-run partnership for the third wicket kept alive unlikely home hopes after South Africa were 90-2 at lunch.

Quinton de Kock hit another swashbuckling knock, but by the time he fell for 39 runs, with eight wickets down, the contest was already over.

Van der Dussen was given out leg before wicket to Chris Woakes with just the third ball he faced on Monday and almost ran out of time as he dithered over whether to review, but then won a reprieve as the ball was shown to be missing the wickets.

He took advantage to hit 15 fours and two sixes in a boundary-filled innings and will be livid with the way he went out, essentially ending hopes of fairytale for both himself and his team.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i7mr1x/article30668331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WOODK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/johannesburg-test-england-beat-south-africa-by-191-runs-to-take-series-3-1/article30668332.ece
244,2020/01/27,Sivaramakrishnan likely to head the selection panel,"According to the new constitution of the Board, “The senior most Test cap among the members of the [senior selection] committee shall be appointed as the chairman.”

Among the three candidates vying for the two vacancies, L. Sivaramakrishnan, Venkatesh Prasad and Ajit Agarkar — the tenures of selection panel chief M.S.K. Prasad and Gagan Khoda are coming to an end — the former India and Tamil Nadu leg-spinner is tipped to be the chairman since the Board of Control for Cricket (BCCI) rules back him.

Sivaramakrishnan made his Test debut way back in 1983 — he was a teenage prodigy — against Clive Lloyd’s mighty West Indians in Antigua. Subsequently, Siva represented India in nine Tests, 16 ODIs, and played 76 First Class games.

Prasad, a crafty seamer, first played a Test against England in 1996, Birmingham, and went on to play 33 Tests, 161 ODIs and 123 First Class games. Pace bowling all-rounder Agarkar’s Test versus Zimbabwe in Harare, 1998, was his first. He turned out in 26 Tests and 191 ODIs, apart from showcasing his skills in 110 First Class matches.

Qualifying yardstick

The BCCI’s qualifying yardstick for senior national selectors are — 1: seven Test matches or, 2: 30 First Class matches or, 3. 10 ODIs and 20 First Class matches.

And every member of the selection committee should have retired from the game five years previously.

The men’s selection panel will appoint the captain for the team, who shall be an ex-Officio member of the committee. The captain, however, shall not be entitled to vote.

In the event of there being an equality of votes in the appointment of the captain, the chairperson will have the casting vote.

Rules favour Siva

Indeed, the board rules have made Siva a favourite for the chairman’s job; he is the senior-most according to its own laws.

Agarkar donned the Test cap only in the late 90s and Prasad, who made his Test debut in the mid-90s, has completed one-and-a-half years as a BCCI junior selector which leave his position in the senior panel a bit uncertain.

The three remaining selectors, Sarandeep Singh, Debang Gandhi and Jatin Paranje, represented India much later than Siva. Jatin, in fact, played only ODIs.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5g00v1/article30668207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28SIVA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sivaramakrishnan-likely-to-head-the-selection-panel/article30668208.ece
245,2020/01/27,Still have time to work on our mistakes before T20 World Cup: Seifert,"New Zealand wicketkeeper Tim Seifert is not too worried about the team’s first two defeats in the T20I series against India affecting the team’s World T20 preparations as he feels they still have time to get their act together before the tournament kicks off in October.

“We are not playing our best at the moment. There are 20 odd games before the World Cup, and that tournament is the pinnacle, so we will get there (in preparation),” Seifert said here on Wednesday.

Seifert said the team would like to replicate the 2019 tour of India, where New Zealand came out 2-1 victorious in the three-match series.

Not the end of the world

“We have lost the first two games but we haven’t played badly. We definitely haven’t played our best though while India has played very well. If we lose the series on Wednesday, it is not the end of the world. But if we can turn things around, and win, we will take things from there,” he said.

He also heaped praise on India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.

“Even in the first game, Bumrah bowled slower balls that were going wider. Normally, death bowlers get into straighter lines, plus yorkers and mix it with chest height. He kind of changes things a lot and is tougher to play,” Seifert said.

“The ball was holding a lot more which made it tougher. So sometimes as a batsman you have to move away from the stumps and see if they bowl straight. I was backing myself to do something different instead of just standing there at the wicket,” said the stumper, who remained unbeaten on 33 off 26 balls.

Tricky

“It was tricky and the ball was holding a little bit. When Kane (Williamson) got out in the over against Yuzvendra Chahal, we knew it was the over to push because they had Bumrah coming back,” he added.

He also said Indian batters adapted well to their conditions.

“Indian batsmen showed how to get under the ball and time it. They showed it a couple of times and on the slower wickets you just have to keep it like that. Once you lose your shape, you are not in position,” he said.

“Try to get them (bowlers) off line or off balance, try to get into that position to hit good balls. That’s T20 cricket as well. Sometimes it’s going 100% but some times you have to take a breath and re-assess. Indian batters did that well.

“To be honest, in the first game they were 110/1 and they had wickets in hand. We didn’t bowl too badly in that first game. In the second game, we only got 130 and it is tough to bowl at Eden Park (with that total),” said Seifert.

“170 was the target in mind but once you get 130 on the board, that was going to be very hard at Eden Park against a team that is very strong and playing really well.

247,2020/01/27,Railways finds the going tough,"For a large part of Monday Railways, hosting its penultimate game of the season, struggled to get going, the mood in the dressing room and the performance on field mirroring the dark, overcast conditions.

The host was reduced to 98/6 in 49 overs when play was called off on the opening day due to bad light, a condition that had, accompanied by a slight drizzle and mist, wiped out the entire morning session. Karnataka won the toss and elected to field.

Captain Arindam Ghosh was unbeaten on 32 and Avinash Yadav on 29, adding 53 for the sixth wicket for a desperate fightback against the Karnataka seamers who had to simply stick to the basics to reap the reward.

Railways officials admitted their batsmen stayed back when they should have played forward to counter the low bounce. The surface at Karnail Singh Stadium has, traditionally, been a batsman’s delight. And regardless of the pitch having been relaid or the heavy conditions, it stayed true to form with little assistance for the bowlers.

Abhimanyu Mithun began the charge when Ashish Sehrawat top-edged a short, wide delivery to the wicketkeeper in the third over. Mrunal Devdhar and Saurabh Singh hung around, fending off the bowlers but unable to add much to the total.

Mahesh Rawat, playing his first game and Dinesh Mor, the youngster who has replaced him behind the stumps, were both beaten by the low bounce from left-arm seamer Prateek Jain before Avinash joined his skipper for grinding out the remaining 24.5 overs for the day.

“Honestly, this is not a pitch for fast bowling but I managed to land in the right areas and the ball was moving a bit initially. But there is not much support and it will only assist the batsmen in the coming days. The ball will keep low and it will be important to bowl a tight line here,” Prateek, who picked up four wickets, admitted.

With conditions unlikely to get better over the coming days, Karnataka would be desperate to get bat as soon as possible on day two seeking a result.

The scores:

Railways — 1st innings: Mrunal Devdhar lbw b Prateek 12, Ashish Sehrawat c Sharath b Mithun 0, Saurabh Singh b Prateek 7, Arindam Ghosh (batting) 32, Mahesh Rawat b Prateek 0, Dinesh Mor b Prateek 4, Harsh Tyagi c Sharath b Mithun 9, Avinash Yadav (batting) 29, Extras (b-1, lb-2, nb-2): 5; Total (for six wkts. in 49 overs): 98.

Fall of wickets: 1-5, 2-20, 3-23, 4-23, 5-29, 6-45.

Karnataka bowling: Abhimanyu Mithun 8-4-18-2, Prateek Jain 13-7-14-4, Ronit More 6-2-10-0, K.

248,2020/01/27,"No change in IPL night game start timing of 8 p.m., final in Mumbai","The title clash of the Indian Premier League (IPL) will be held in Mumbai on May 24 and the night matches will have the usual 8 p.m. start as the Governing Council decided against changing the timings, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly announced on Monday.

“There will be no change in the timing of IPL night games. It will start from 8 pm like earlier years,” Ganguly told reporters after the IPL Governing Council meeting.

“We will have only five double headers (4pm and 8 pm) this time. We have decided to reduce the number of double headers,” Ganguly said adding that the “final will be held in Mumbai.”

In a first, concussion substitute and ‘third umpire no ball’ will also be introduced in the upcoming edition of the popular T20 league, the former India captain informed.

“The concussion substitute and the no ball rule are new additions for the season,” he said.

Players’ safety has assumed significance of late with incidents of cricketers getting injured while batting increasing.

New concussion rules were introduced in Test format as well last year. Australian batsman Steve Smith was replaced by Marnus Labuschagne on Day 5 of the second Ashes 2019 Test at Lord’s under the rules.

Recently young Indian batsman Rishabh Pant also suffered from concussion after being hit on his helmet by Pat Cummins during the first ODI between India and Australia on January 14. KL Raul had kept wickets in place of Pant.

The third umpire will now make the exclusive ‘no ball’ call instead of the on-field umpires. It was trialled during the recent India and West Indies ODI series.

All Stars Game

In a noble gesture, the BCCI will have an ‘All Stars Game’ between all top international players before the start of the IPL on March 29 for a charitable cause.

The venue for the game, though, has not been decided as yet. Ganguly said the BCCI will handover the proceeds to an appropriate forum.

“It will be an IPL All Stars Game three days before the start of the IPL. The venue is not Ahmedabad as it is still not match ready. We have not decided on where we will make the donation,” the BCCI president said.

Asked about the meeting with National Cricket Academy chief Rahul Dravid, Ganguly said that there have been extensive discussions about revamping the facility, which has been under the scanner of late.

“As it has already been reported, we will have a nutritionist and biomechanics bowling coach at the NCA,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/r6b9z2/article30666832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUMBAIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/no-change-in-ipl-night-game-start-timing-of-8-pm-final-in-mumbai/article30666833.ece
249,2020/01/27,Pakistan vs Bangladesh | Third T20 washed out,"Pakistan retained its No. 1 ranking in the Twenty20 format after rain washed out the third and final match of the series against Bangladesh on Monday.

Rain arrived an hour before the scheduled toss at 1.30 p.m. local time (0830 GMT) before umpires called off the play at 3.55 p.m. local time, to the disappointment of around 5,000 fans at the Gaddafi Stadium.

Pakistan clinched the series 2-0 after beating Bangladesh by five wickets and nine wickets, respectively.

The No. 1 ranking, which Pakistan earned in January 2018, was under threat after the team lost eight of its nine T20s in 2019, but the recall of veteran batsmen Shoaib Malik and Mohammad Hafeez strengthened the batting line-up. Malik scored an unbeaten 58 in the first match, while Hafeez remained not out on 67 in the second game in two easy run-chases.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/4nc36l/article30666164.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LAHOREKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pakistan-vs-bangladesh-third-t20-washed-out/article30666165.ece
250,2020/01/27,Congress meets NHRC officials over police ‘brutalities’ on anti-CAA protesters in U.P.,"The Congress on Monday approached the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to demand action against Uttar Pradesh police officials who allegedly committed atrocities on people protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), with former party chief Rahul Gandhi accusing the State government of going to war against its own people.

The delegation, led by Mr. Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, submitted a detailed 31-page memorandum, including video clips and photographs as “evidence of atrocities” and human rights violations by U.P. police officials against whom no official complaint has been registered.

“The NHRC must act decisively to protect the idea of India & the Constitutional rights of our citizens,” Mr. Gandhi said in a tweet.

In the memorandum to the NHRC, the party alleged that the BJP government in the State “treats its own citizens like criminals”.

‘Reckless government’

“Given the role of a reckless State government that views the law and Constitution as mere inconveniences, the duty of institutions such as the NHRC to act as checks and balances and to embody and protect the values enshrined in the Constitution of India becomes paramount,” the Congress memorandum said.

The party argued that the NHRC has always stood tall with its glorious history when other institutions have fallen short.

253,2020/01/27,Role of relocated IGNCA as cultural space could be expanded: Minister,"The Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) is not only set to be relocated from its current home on Man Singh Road as a part of the government’s redevelopment of Central Vista, but an expansion of its role as a cultural space was also being considered, according to Culture Minister Prahlad Singh Patel.

Mr. Patel told The Hindu on Sunday that “open discussions” would be held on the facilities that will come up in the new IGNCA complex. As a part of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry’s revamp of Central Vista, IGNCA is among the buildings proposed to be demolished in order to make way for 10 new government office buildings by 2024, according to the draft master plan. A “national cultural centre” on a 15-acre plot near Jamnagar House has been proposed to replace it, according to a source involved in the planning. The source added that officials of the IGNCA were being consulted on the requirements from a new building.

Mr. Patel said the IGNCA’s existing role, that of a centre for research, publication, events and training, would remain, but additional facilities could be added.

“We will have open discussions with stakeholders on this. For example, we want to revive the Buddhism circuit and want to have an office of the International Buddhist Conclave. When the location is shifted, we will have to decide the different wings in the complex, perhaps an IBC office. Or if we want to set up a chair, these kinds of activities will be in this cultural space,” he said, adding that the new building would be constructed accordingly.

Citing the example of the under-construction Museum on Prime Ministers, Mr. Patel said: “Like there is one museum for all Prime Ministers, there should be one space for cultural activities. Visitors are not looking at which party the Prime Minister belonged to.”

IGNCA, which was set up in 1985 under the Culture Ministry in honour of late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi after her death in 1984, is meant to be a resource centre for the arts and to provide a forum for creative and critical dialogue, according to its stated aims and objectives.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/3yzbx0/article30660940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL27-PRAHLADSINGHPATEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/role-of-relocated-ignca-as-cultural-space-could-be-expanded-minister/article30660941.ece

255,2020/01/27,Demonstration held in Gurugram to celebrate constitutional values,"Several residents, under the aegis of Gurgaon Nagrik Ekta Manch, held a demonstration at upscale DLF Phase-IV’s Galleria Market on Sunday evening to mark the 71st Republic Day.

Altaf Ahmad, a member of the organisation, said the demonstration was to “celebrate the core values of the Constitution” and similar events were held on Friday and Saturday as well in the run-up to Republic Day.

The group held two 10-minute separate demonstrations in the market.

Mr. Ahmad, along with other members of the manch, sat in a circle with the copy of the Constitution for a few minutes in silence before dispersing.

Mr. Ahmad loudly recited the Preamble of the Constitution with the demonstrators repeating after him.

They also sang Saare Jahan Se Accha.

Independent film-maker Rahul Roy, another member of the outfit, said the aim of the demonstration was to “put constitutional values in the public space as much as possible”: “It is sad that we are living in a time when even holding up a banner with ‘Secular India’ written on it is seen as provocative.

‘Institutes in crisis’

Manch member advocate Monu Kuhar, who is also a human rights activist, said that major institutes of the country are already facing a credibility crisis under the Narendra Modi government and now the educational institutes and the Constitution were also under threat.

He said that every citizen was duty-bound to stand up for the values of the Constitution.

Some shoppers also joined the demonstration.

Tabrez Alam, along with his minor son, decided to be a part of the demonstration.

Ms. Akhtar had said that Delhi Police entered the university campus on December 15 without permission and the process of filing a complaint against them had begun.

257,2020/01/27,Dadis of Shaheen Bagh hoist Tricolour on R-Day,"On Sunday, as the nation celebrated the 71st Republic Day, thousands of people flocked to Shaheen Bagh, where people have been on a sit-in against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act for over a month, to hoist the national flag.

The Tricolour was unfurled by the ‘dadis’ who have been spearheading the anti-CAA protest, along with the mother of Rohith Vemula, a former student of the University of Hyderabad whose suicide led to widespread outrage as a case of discrimination against Dalits.

After singing the national anthem, the protesters resumed their demonstration on the arterial road.

Shaheen Bagh resident and businesswoman Roohi, who has been a regular at the protest since it began on December 15, said: “I make time everyday after work to come to the protest”.

On being asked why she was against the CAA, Ms. Roohi said: “It is not written in the Constitution that one can give certain rights to a person based on his or her religion. Also, who has proper documents these days? Today, it is the Muslims, tomorrow it will be other minorities such as the Sikhs and the Christians.”

Protest swells

The demonstration, which has been going on for over 40 days, has attracted a number of people from all over the country.

Twenty-nine-year-old Hasan Raza, a resident of Saharsa District in Bihar, said he has been in Delhi for the last five days just to join the Shaheen Bagh protest.

“Nowhere else will you see more Tricolours in the hands of the people than what you see here today,” Mr. Raza, who previously worked as a translator.

He said everyone involved in the protest was waiting for the Central government to respond to their demands.

“When the Supreme Court gave the Babri Masjid verdict, everybody appreciated it, including those from the Muslim community, as we wanted to bury the past and look forward to a peaceful future,” he added.

“The CAA is a different story altogether. Why should only the Muslims be forced to show their papers? The Constitution is same for all, hence it should apply to all,” he said, adding that he does not plan to go back home till the protest ends.

Mohamud Muklesh, a businessman from Najafgarh, said he has been bringing refreshments such as samosas, biscuits and water for the protesters. He added that he had bought the items with his own money.

Mr. Muklesh rued that the government has not been responding to the protest.

Nasir Ahmad, a businessman from neighbouring Maharani Bagh, said the Centre has been ignoring their protest. “This issue is out of the hands of the Delhi government,” he added.

“There has been a lot of misinformation doing the rounds in the media and the social media about the protesters here. Some people say we are having a picnic here. Is sitting on a road a picnic?” Mr. Ahmad remarked.

“The Constitution, which was framed by Bhim Rao Ambedkar, should be the basis of all law framed in the country. The current government cannot just frame a law as per their wishes,” he added.

Supporting the cause

At the protest site, Tamanna Sharma, a green entrepreneur who was seen picking up litter in the area, said: “We feel that this is our way of supporting the cause. If the protest site stays clean, people can protest longer.”

“If we lose out on the Constitution, we lose out on the environment. People don’t have documents in the jungle, so it is the easiest way to take away the rights and land from tribals living in the jungle,” she added.

Asked what she would do with the bags of litter collected so far, Ms. Sharma said it will be given to the local municipality.

Jamia Hamdard University students Nilofar and Ashar Azizi said they had come to Shaheen Bagh, along with 200 fellow students, with black balloons as a mark of protest against the “kaala kaanoon (Black Law)”.

The students also marked Republic Day as ‘Constitution Protection Day’.

Mr. Azizi said: “We cannot afford to lose this war against the citizenship law... Imagine if a pan-India National Register of Citizens happens, millions will become Stateless. It will create a humanitarian crisis.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1ckvh6/article30660797.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27DEBAGH1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dadis-of-shaheen-bagh-hoist-tricolour-on-r-day/article30660802.ece
258,2020/01/27,Local elections are fought on local issues: DPCC chief Subhash Chopra,"The people of Delhi are looking to the Congress once again to continue the 15-year development journey set in motion by late Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) chief Subhash Chopra told The Hindu in a recent interview. Excerpts:

In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Congress improved its vote share and in five out of seven seats it came in second after the BJP. Do you think this performance will improve in the Assembly elections? And what lessons has the Congress learnt from its defeat in the 2015 Assembly elections?

The 2015 Assembly elections were very different. It was contested on the basis of the Jan Lokpal Bill and a corruption-free society. Now, the issues are different and the main plank is development. This is a local election and one should always fight a local election on local issues. When the Congress government came to power in Delhi, there was no electricity and no water. Over 15 years, under the leadership of Sheila Dikshit, we solved the electricity and water problems, we built the Delhi Metro, we built infrastructure like flyovers, we introduced CNG to tackle pollution. Delhi even won an award for the best green city in the country.

Arvind Kejriwal came with the slogan of Jan Lokpal and a corruption-free society. Not only has he not been able to achieve that, he stopped the development work of the Congress and was unable to maintain the pace of development. People of Delhi want the Congress back so that the transformation of Delhi can continue, and we are confident that we will get a majority and form the government.

The Congress has taken a stand against the CAA, the NRC and the NPR and has said that it will include it in its manifesto as well. You have said that the election will be fought on local issues but do you think this will be a major election plank? Why do you think the AAP has been cautions with its stand?

Delhi is a mini-India and we have been against this plan of the BJP to polarise society since the time the Citizenship Amendment Bill was tabled. The BJP government has added six new clauses to the National Population Register (NPR) to harass the poor. It is not something that impacts only a single community, but the country as a whole and we will not introduce it in Delhi, like several non-BJP governed States have done. As far as Mr. Kejriwal is concerned, I don’t understand how a person who sat on dharna outside the Rail Bhawan to get three police officers suspended is so silent now when students of Jamia Millia Islamia were beaten up after the police entered the library on campus without asking for permission from the university Vice Chancellor. The same police stood as spectators waiting for the VC to call them in when masked goons beat up students at JNU. The CM was in his bungalow sleeping and a month after the incidents, with an eye on votes, made a statement that his party was against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. AAP has not had a word of sympathy for the women of Shaheen Bagh. It is the Congress that has been with the students and people of Delhi who are fighting to save the Constitution and the future of India. AAP is the ‘B-team’ of the BJP.

Why are you saying that AAP is the ‘B-team’ of the BJP?

The India Against Corruption movement brought the BJP to power at the Centre and AAP to power in Delhi. Since then, people who were members of the party like Prashant Bhushan, Ashutosh, Yogendra Yadav and Kumar Vishwas have all left AAP. There must be something wrong if the 10-20 people who genuinely wanted a corruption-free society have left the party. Instead of sending one of the genuine people in the party to the Rajya Sabha, the AAP nominated two rich people. This shows that Mr. Kejriwal is only after money. The movement that brought him to power has been diluted and even the people who founded the movement have left because they have seen the reality of the party from inside. Moreover, AAP fought its last election asking for full statehood for Delhi, but when a full State like Jammu and Kashmir was turned into a Union Territory and bifurcated, Mr. Kejriwal supported the move.

AAP has gone on a media blitzkrieg showing its achievements over the past five years. How will the Congress counter AAP’s claims of development?

In which field has Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal achieved anything? The only department in which he has got 100% marks is in the field of advertising where he has wasted the money of the taxpayers. That money could have been put to better use to actually bring about concrete development. Otherwise, I do not see any department where he can boast that he has achieved something.

As far as free electricity is concerned, the Congress government was the first to start subsidy in electricity. We will ensure that when we come to power that the benefit will reach the people of Delhi directly. On the other hand, reports have shown that Delhi’s water is not safe for drinking. We will be launching a scheme to ensure water security and provide cash back to those consumers who make judicious use of water so that we will not face a water shortage in the future.

The Congress and AAP have been focusing their respective campaigns on development, but the BJP has been raking up a lot of national issues and one candidate has been reprimanded for certain objectionable statements. How will the Congress ensure that local issues are discussed?

The BJP is constantly trying to polarise the election. There was no reason for violence in Delhi; the Capital never saw such violence earlier. Why have those people who have indulged in violence not been booked yet?

AAP has particularly been publicising development in the education and healthcare sector. How do you see their claims?

When it comes to education, children have dropped out of school, and AAP has built only a handful of new schools instead of the 500 promised in its manifesto. In fact, it has converted playgrounds that are essential for children into classrooms.

In the health sector too, we brought the scheme of opening 27 new hospitals but they abandoned it. They are boasting that they have improved the healthcare sector but at the same time the CM and the Deputy CM have spent lakhs of money getting treatment from hospitals outside Delhi.

AAP was unable to give pension to widows, senior citizens and the disabled and they are claiming that they have done so much work in Delhi. A government that cannot even give pension is spending so much on advertising its work. That is why the Congress will provide ₹5,000 as pension in a new scheme named after former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit who was the mother of Delhi.

Regularisation of unauthorised colonies is a major election plank. The Congress has opposed the scheme. How will you explain to residents of unauthorised colonies why you have opposed the scheme?

Forty percent of people living in unauthorised colonies will not benefit from the Central government’s scheme. The BJP said it will give registration to everybody. But till today, they have given only 20 registrations. Why have registrations not been given to people? The BJP is just waiting for another 10-15 days and after that they will forget about the scheme. It was only a scheme brought out for the election.

The Congress has announced a mix of young and senior faces but many senior leaders are missing. Why are you not contesting?

If I contest, then who will manage the election of the other candidates? My daughter is contesting. And, it is not because of me that she is contesting, but because of her own merit. And, like her, there are many faces that have been working for the party in the background and it is now time for such educated young people to come to the forefront.

Why did the Congress give the Rashtriya Janata Dal four seats?

We have a national alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav’s party and we formed an alliance in Delhi as there was a demand from pockets in the city that have a large Bihari population. We have done this to give respect to the people of Bihar who live in Delhi.

259,2020/01/27,Court relief for convict in drunk driving case,"A Delhi court has modified the six-month simple imprisonment of a man to the period already served in a drunk driving case on the grounds of his poor economic background and clean past image.

A Magistrate court had held the man guilty of drunk driving and had ordered him to pay ₹10,000 as fine and serve six-months simple imprisonment. For the offence of driving a vehicle without a valid licence, he was fined ₹5,000.

In the appeal, the man did not challenge the conviction but sought modification of the sentence as he is the sole breadwinner of his family that includes his aged parents.

“Considering the fact that appellant is the sole breadwinner in his family and he is not convicted by any court of law prior to the trial court, the interest of justice would be served if appellant is sentenced for the period already undergone by him,” Additional District Judge Deepak Jagotra said, adding that the fine amount shall remain the same as awarded by the trial court.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-relief-for-convict-in-drunk-driving-case/article30660713.ece

261,2020/01/27,"In video message, Kejriwal flays Amit Shah for ‘insulting’ Delhiites","Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday released a video message on his Twitter handle, saying Home Minister Amit Shah has been “insulting” the people of Delhi in his campaign speeches, “which is not right”.

“In the last five years, the people of Delhi have worked very hard to improve our city. Two crore people got together to fix our schools, hospitals, electricity and water supply. But Mr. Shah comes daily and makes fun of the hard work of the people,” Mr. Kejriwal said, adding that a few days ago the Home Minister had said that no CCTV cameras were installed in the city, “...the next day, people sent him a CCTV recording of his own speech”.

In the video message, the CM said: “Delhiites have installed two lakh cameras so far. How many cameras have you [Mr. Shah] installed in Delhi? Not even one right? Instead of making fun of the people, it would have been better if your government had installed some cameras here.”

Mr. Kejriwal also listed out achievements in the field of education and congratulated the children for achieving a pass percentage of 96%. He also thanked the parents and 65,000 teachers for their efforts.

“In the history of India, no State has ever had a pass percentage of over 96% in government schools. The other States record results in the range of 40%-50%. The people of Delhi are proud of their children’s success,” Mr. Kejriwal said, adding that over 400 children from government schools have cleared the IIT JEE exam. “You [Mr. Shah] take some time out so that I can take you to some schools. I assure you that you will love meeting the children. Your negativity will also go away,” Mr. Kejriwal added.

The AAP leader ended the video by saying: “We, the two crore people of Delhi are like one family irrespective of which party we belong to. We stand by each other in good and bad times. Together, we have improved our city. I hope you will stop insulting the achievements of Delhiites.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/in-video-message-kejriwal-flays-amit-shah-for-insulting-delhiites/article30660693.ece

263,2020/01/27,Songs of dusk: The stories behind hymns like “Abide with me”,"With “Abide with me” being restored for the Beating the Retreat ceremony at Rajpath, it’s worth noting that the hymn is not confined to religious belief, but is universal in its humanistic appeal. Mercifully, it abides, to enthrall the hearts of those who wait a year to witness its public performance to military rhythm, as perhaps nowhere else in the world, much to the glory of India’s secular credentials.

“Abide With Me” was composed by an ailing Rev. Henry F. Lyte (1793-1847) while on a voyage from England to Italy for recuperation. He died soon after. The words, “Abide with me, fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens, Lord with me abide... Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day; Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away…”, harks back to a gloomy evening. Darkness probably hovered all around and the sick person, who wondered if his end was near, with the lingering hope that God’s mercy would abide with him.

Old friends

Most of these hymns one remembers were sung to music by T. L. D’Cruz in the Mayapuri parish of West Delhi and the choir in the Sacred Heart Cathedral. So when you suddenly awake from slumber because of a power cut and hear the nightjar, remember that like the hymns, it’s Nature's way of comforting and strengthening us for the travails of the coming day. For that matter didn’t Josh Malihabadi make the Urdu Manzil in the Jama Masjid echo to his matutinal verses long before the sun rose above the ramparts of the Red Fort in a bijli-pani hassle-free Delhi?

The best songs have been sung at night, whether by the bulbul, nightingale, courtesan, poet, lover, mendicant, the terminally ill or the watchman, depressed or elated. There’s nothing surprising about this because night is the time when one can reflect in the eloquent silence of darkness.

The hymnal, We Celebrate, reprinted by the Delhi Archdiocese at Chuna Mandi, Paharganj, in 1998 contains many hymns which may be regarded as God-given songs in the night. This hymnal is an extension of the one originally published by the Agra Archdiocese of which Delhi was once a part.

It was in 1859 that Monsignor Persico brought one of the first pipe organs in the Indian subcontinent for the Agra Cathedral from Belgium. It remained in service until 1883, when a new organ, costing ₹10,000 (a big amount then) replaced it in the rear balcony of the Cathedral nave.

In later years, this organ became little short of a museum piece — there was hardly anybody to play it after Mother Mary St. Berdnadine, the organist for 50 years, died in 1937. It is said that she played the organ so loudly that the Cathedral walls shuddered with the vibrant notes.

Trying times

Now, 83 years after the death of Mother Bernadine of the Society of Jesus & Mary, one has come across a collection of hymns by Col Henry Garispy of the US Branch of the Salvation Army, aptly entitled Songs in the Night. The Colonel has also given the history behind the hymns which are sung not only in India, but all over the world. Many of these hymns originated during the American Civil War in the mid 19th century.

There were many poignant occasions when now-famous songs were composed. “Silent night, holy night …” the Christmas hymn, was written during a crisis in the small church of St. Nicholos in a little Austrian town in 1813. “What a friend we have in Jesus” was written by Joseph Scriven (1819-86), an Irishman, to comfort his ill mother. “Precious Lord, take my hand, lead me home…” was composed by Thomas Dorsey after his wife died in childbirth and soon after his infant son too, in Chicago. “Lead kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom” came to Cardinal Newman in the 19th century, while his ship was becalmed in the Mediterranean and he became sick and doubted whether he would reach his home shore safely.

For Mahtama Gandhi “Abide with me” was a prayer for courage and strength during the frustrating years of the freedom struggle. Thankfully, it will continue to be a part of the parade at Rajpath.

265,2020/01/27,Driving away the isolation ward blues,"Long stay at hospitals makes anyone yearn to return home. More so, when admitted on mere suspicion of an infection or disease. The predicament of some of those admitted to the Isolation Wards of Sir Ronald Ross Institute for Tropical and Communicable Diseases (Fever Hospital), Nallakunta is similar. They have been admitted there on the suspicion that they might have contacted Novel Cornonavirus (nCoV).

In a first at any State government hospital, State Health Department officials have provided television sets with cable connection and newspapers in the Isolation Wards as an attempt to keep the in-patients engaged. The facilities were provided on priority basis.

Till date, five persons were admitted at the hospital’s isolation ward which is located in the interior part of the hospital. Whoever is suspected to be having nCoV is allotted a bed in the large hall. Only doctors, nurses, staff are allowed to enter the wards.

All the five in-patients were discharged from the hospital. Sources said that within a few hours of getting admitted, a few of them wanted to go home. In fact, one of them was persistent to leave and repeatedly placed the request with an official at the hospital. State Health Department officials said that anyone who stays at hospitals will get bored and will be anxious too.

“Television sets with a cable connection were provided to prevent them from getting bored,” said Dr K Shankar, superintendent of the Fever Hospital. Newspapers in three languages are being supplied to them.

266,2020/01/27,Ex-officio voters tilt hung municipalities for TRS,"The ex-officio member votes of as many as four MLCs and one MLA (the highest), combined with ‘strategic silence’ of six BJP members at voting, resulted in the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi clinch the crucial Nalgonda municipality on Monday.

Nalgonda legislator K. Bhupal Reddy, MLCs including Legislative Council Chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy, Palla Rajeshwar Reddy, Nethi Vidyasagar and Tera Chinnappa Reddy, with support of an independent candidate and an AIMIM-elected corporator, catapulted TRS numbers from 20 to 27.

E-communication

Interestingly, an official online communication from BJP Nalgonda earlier in the day, that its chairman candidate Bandaru Prasad would take oath as vice-chairman became talk of the town. However, when all the TRS and its alliance members left the office post-chairman election, the vice-chairman voting only ended in “postponed for want of quorum of 27 members.”

High tension prevailed in Choutuppal, when Munugode MLA Komatireddy Rajagopal Reddy got into a heated exchange with the three CPI(M) members, who till Monday were supporting the Congress and turned in favour of TRS before voting.

Mr. Rajagopal Reddy’s comments on ex-officio members, TRS attempts to clinch Yadagirigutta, among others, also sparked outrage. Mr. Reddy was detained by the police for a brief time, which in turn caused Congress activists to sit in protest on the NH-65 near Choutuppal.

Ex-officio members were crucial in tilting the victory for TRS in Bhuvanagiri, Yadagirigutta, Chityal and Halia, where the local legislators exercised their votes. Voting in Nereducherla municipality was postponed to Tuesday following intervention of the State Election Commission regarding the option of Congress MP K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao.

267,2020/01/27,Second sample from city tests negative for nCoV,"The test results of swab samples collected from a person admitted at isolation ward of Fever Hospital turned negative for Novel Coronavirus (nCoV). This is the second sample sent from Hyderabad which tested negative for nCoV. Officials initially mulled to send the samples of two others, but decided against it as they did not have symptoms.

“The second sample sent from here tested negative,” said Dr. K Shankar, superintendent of Fever Hospital. Telangana Health Department officials said that they were instructed to collect samples from people who have travel history to China and experience symptoms such as cold, cough, breathlessness. Besides, if anyone in close contact with the person who has returned from China, like spouse or parents, experience the symptoms, their samples too will be collected.

“If someone has only travel history and does not show any symptoms, he or she will be closely observed even if at home,” Dr Shankar said.

Health Department officials said that as incubation period of nCoV varies from person to person, some show symptoms in five days, some take a little longer. So, people who have a travel history but do not experience any symptoms will be closely monitored for 28 days after returning from China.

In the past one week, a total of five persons were isolated at Fever Hospital. Samples were collected from only two as they had travel history to China and experienced the symptoms. Of the three remaining, two had the travel history, and the fifth was in close contact with one of them. All five were discharged on different days.

268,2020/01/27,Global cooperation needed to contain Coronavirus: Venkaiah,"Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Monday voiced his concern over the spread of Coronavirus and underscored the need for global cooperation for early detection and control of the spread of the disease.

The virus strain was spreading rapidly across nations and causing a major concern to health authorities, he noted and pointed out that the periodic outbreak of new viruses not only highlight our vulnerability to diseases but also the need to take steps on a global scale to contain any serious fallout.

Mr. Naidu, addressing scientists and research scholars and others at the CSIR-Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CCMB) at its campus, said: “There are new challenges to scientists with climate change, pollution, new viruses, new diseases, resistance to antibiotics and so on. There have been advancements in science and technology over the years, but we cannot afford to be complacent and sit back on our laurels.”

Modern medicine has been facing a serious threat as many antibiotics might eventually become ineffective and if it continues unchecked, even a common infection could turn into a health threat. Hence, it was imperative to develop new antibiotics apart from preventing drug resistance.

The Vice-President urged scientists to focus more on agriculture considering the difficulties of farmers, so that the production is more from pest/diseases resistant crops giving remunerative prices. He was enthused about the new rice variety, developed by CCMB scientists here in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Rice Research ‘Samba Masuri’, a pest resistant and diabetic-friendly rice adopted by farmers in eight States spread over three lakh hectares and a turnover of ₹2,880 crore.

“I am told the farmers’ benefit is about ₹550 crore. This should be taken to all States across the country,” he said and said scientific research should ultimately lead to improving people’s lives. CCMB has made pioneering work in population genetics, DNA fingerprinting, molecular biology, protection of endangered animals and so on, he noted and wanted it to develop rapid DNA testing kits to detect genetic disorders of rare diseases.

It is providing diagnostic testing and counselling for 35 rare diseases. “It is important to predict and prevent genetic diseases as more than 70 million Indians are estimated to be suffering from genetic disorders and also take up campaigns on a massive scale to create awareness among the people about the health risks associated with consanguineous marriages. The private sector too should chip in and set up a fund to fund scientific and technological research,” he observed.

Labs like CCMB should become global hubs in their respective scientific fields, he felt and called for encouraging young scientists to take up challenging research assignments and come up with innovative ideas. Earlier, he went around the exhibits which highlighted the research activities undertaken by CCMB accompanied by Director Dr. Rakesh Mishra and others.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tnv728/article30668364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy27CCMB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/global-cooperation-needed-to-contain-coronavirus-venkaiah/article30668365.ece
269,2020/01/27,Roads being re-carpeted under CRMP,"Two stretches of road in Charminar Zone are the first ones to be re-carpeted under the much publicised Comprehensive Road Maintenance Programme (CRMP) by GHMC. Both are located in Rajendranagar circle, officials informed.

The first stretch is the main thoroughfare of Upparpally, the corridor between pillar numbers 170 and 191 of the PVNR Express Highway, and the next is the major connecting road near pillar number 270 of the circle. The re-carpeting work involves milling of the existing road, and re-laying the stretch with BT.

Under the CRMP, private agencies have been handed over the maintenance of major stretches of road in the city for five years, for a contract value of ₹1,827 crore. Maintenance of a total of 709 km road length has been given out to five agencies in all the six zones under the programme, with an aim to improve the infrastructural services to the citizens. As per the agreement, all the stretches should be re-carpeted at least once during the five-year period.

“We have given instructions to agencies that milling should be part of the re-carpeting works, and over-laying of the existing road is not permitted,” informed Chief Engineer (Maintenance) Mohd. Ziauddin.

Road re-carpeting works are scheduled to be launched in other zones too starting from this week, he said. Other than re-carpeting, private road maintenance works have also begun on several stretches in the city, under the programme launched since December 10.

270,2020/01/27,"No bar on designing, budgeting for new Secretariat building: Telangana HC","The State government is at liberty to go ahead with the works relating to designing of the proposed new Secretariat building and estimation of the cost, the Telangana High Court said on Monday.

No order staying the designing of new Secretariat building was passed by the HC, noted a division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy. Hearing a batch of PIL pleas challenging the government’s decision to construct a new Secretariat, the bench made it clear that it had only asked the government not to pull down the existing Secretariat complex.

When the petitions came up for hearing on Monday, the bench sought to know from the government if designs for the new Secretariat were finalised and the budget estimates were completed. The Additional Advocate General J. Ramchander Rao informed the HC that government had not taken further steps over construction of the new Secretariat since the matter was sub-judice with the PIL pleas pending.

The CJ said that the pleas could not be adjudicated unless the government spells its ideas on the designs and budget estimates of Secretariat project. Mr. Rao explained that the government was of the view that the money spent on designs of the building would go waste if the petitions were eventually allowed and hence no further steps were taken. There was no bar on the government to explore designs for the proposed new Secretariat building and finalising budget for its construction, the bench observed. The AAG said that the government contemplated creation of nearly 8 lakh to 9 lakh square feet of office space in the new Secretariat building. It would cost close to ₹400 crore, he said.

However, the bench wanted to know how would the budget estimates can be made without having a design in first place. If plans and designs were made available, proposals could be received to construct the same with lesser cost, the bench said. Observing that a counter affidavit filed by the government did not have precise details of its plans on the proposed building, the bench instructed it to file a detailed affidavit on the matter.

274,2020/01/27,A ‘deep dive’ into indie music next for Amit Trivedi,"As per his own admission, Amit Trivedi does not hide emotions well. “Whatever I feel, reflects easily on my face. One look and you’ll know something is up with me,” he says.

It is this expressiveness that shines through in his songs — be it the grunge anger of Dev D that took India by surprise, the stirrings of quiet hope in Queen, or the excitement of new-found love in Andhadhun.

And it is this same expressiveness that has led to Indradhanush, the three-hour concert he brought to YMCA Grounds, Chennai, over the weekend. “Indradhanush is based on seven different emotions that we all experience, which we can equate to the seven colours of the rainbow.” The concert raised funds for RYA Cosmo Elite Foundation’s project, E-bank, which provides free medical equipment for people in need.

In for the ride

With a strong team of singers backing Amit: Meghna Mishra, Arun Kamath, Yashita Sharma and Devender Pal Singh, Indradhanush is an audio-visual delight.

Kicking the concert off with Love, what Amit calls ‘the most powerful emotion’, the performers belt out ‘Naina Da Kya Kasoor’, ‘Pashmina’ and ‘Kaafirana’. For ‘Iktara’, he invites the hundreds gathered under the open sky to sing together, karaoke style.

For all the vagaries of modern love, its story is predictable. You meet someone, feel butterflies in your stomach, fall in love and they eventually leave you, pushing you in a pit of sadness (the depth of which can be compared only to the last time you were, and the next time you will be dumped). But from all the resulting anger, followed by fear, hope rises like a phoenix, and you are grateful that your friends still have your back.

It is almost as if the first half of Indradhanush is taking you through these stages of grief.

After Love comes Sadness, and Devender sets the mood with a soulful rendition of ‘Ikk Kudi’. It’s not all about love though. Amit sings ‘Zinda’, as he imagines the Earth, burdened by climate change, would.

But it is the next segment, Anger, that we have all been waiting for. A grunge version of ‘Emotional Atyachar’, stripped of its comic shehnai, and drilled in by the heartbeats of drums. “I think it’s one of my most overrated songs,” shrugs Amit. The screams in response would say otherwise. In 2009, the song not only gave the world a glimpse of Nawazuddin Siddiqui in an Elvis Presley costume, well before he gained the accolades he has today, it also became India’s breakup anthem for years to come.

And then follows Hope. “Do you have the freedom to say no?” These words flash on the screen, as visuals of secularism and protests play on stage to the tune of ‘Aazaadiyaan’ and ‘Maanjha’. It’s a subtle attempt at addressing the anti-CAA/NRC protests, admits Amit.

New horizons

The second half of Indradhanush seems less about emotions, and more of an excuse for Amit to show off his well-deserved reputation of versatility.

In the Friendship segment, he sits down on stage with his singers to jam acoustic versions of ‘Shaam’ and ‘Gubbare’. The next segment explored cultural roots, and in doing so, had Amit perform the folk fusion numbers he is famous for. Hopping from Maharashtra (‘Navrai majhi’) to Gujarat (‘Shubharambh’), the ensemble proves that nothing gets the audience going like the Indian dhol. Behind us, the audience breaks into an impromptu garba.

“If there is an instrument that is generally used to elicit a particular emotion — for instance, a solo violin for sadness — I will make sure I don’t use it for that purpose,” says Amit, explaining why he loves to experiment with sounds. The same shehnai that he used to introduce comedy in the bitterness of ‘Emotional Atyachar’, was used to turn garba strains into a hip dance number for ‘Shubharambh’.

But the experimenting so far, has always been limited to what the script demands. As a music producer, Amit is very conscious of the director’s vision, preferring to leave him/her in charge. “That’s how it should be, cinema is the biggest medium. You are just one of the technicians helping that cause.”

However, he admits that sometimes, it can get restrictive. And then there are movies like Bombay Velvet which tanked massively. “You put all your energy into making music that is interwoven with the film. So for anybody to enjoy the music, they have to like the films. When they don’t, it is a waste of years of hard work. Most of my pieces then don’t get a chance to come out of the film and stand alone as radio-friendly hits,” says Amit.

But things are changing: his next project is going to be a “full-fledged, deep dive” into indie music, one that he will start soon after his birthday in April.

Although he hasn’t dabbled in Kollywood yet (Queen’s official Tamil remake, for which he composed the music, still has not seen the light of day), he looks forward to working with his contemporaries Anirudh, Santhosh Narayanan, Ghibran, Justin Prabhakaran and Harris Jayaraj. “According to me, there are basically two schools of music, that we follow even in Mumbai — Illaiyaraaja and AR Rahman.”

Meanwhile, Chennai is more than ready to accept his non-Tamil music. As he ends the evening with the chaotic Dance emotion, hundreds of people throw their hands up in the air, doing bhangra to ‘London Thumakda’.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/7pnooc/article30665651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDRADHANUSHMUSCICONCERT4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/amit-trivedi-indradhanush-concert-in-chennai/article30665652.ece
275,2020/01/27,Ariana Grande reacts to Billie Eilish shouting her out at Grammys,"Pop star Ariana Grande’s reaction to Billie Eilish’s acceptance speech at the Grammy Award ceremony here on Sunday has got people talking.

Billie took to the stage after winning album of the year for “When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?” Not only did the “Bad Guy” artiste make history after nabbing seven nominations in the top four major categories, she became the youngest artiste to ever win album of the year.

“Ay, please, sit down,” Billie began her speech with her brother Finneas O’Connell standing right by her side, reports eonline.com.

“Can I just say that I think Ariana deserves this. Thank U, Next... and I think it deserves (it) more than anything in the world.”

However, Ariana shook her head and mouthed the words “no, no, no”.

Ariana also blew air kisses and motioned her hands up and down to the 18-year-old after being praised.

“I love you so much,” Billie continued to the “Bloodline” singer, adding, “I’m not going to waste your time, I’m really not, I love you, thank you for this.”

Finneas shared his thoughts on the album he helped produce and co-write.

“Thank you to the Recording Academy, thank you again to our team, our family, to the people that have supported us from the beginning,” he said.

“To me, we didn’t make an album to win a Grammy... we wrote an album about depression, suicidal thought, climate change and being the bad guy, whatever that means.”

He concluded by saying: “We stand up here confused and grateful.”

Despite not winning in that category, Ariana was living her best life. “I had a great mf time tonight (sic.),” she wrote on Twitter with a short video clip of herself. “Thank u for everything.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/lgmv0z/article30665009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AWARDS-GRAMMYS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ariana-grande-reacts-to-billie-eilish-shouting-her-out-at-grammys/article30665010.ece
276,2020/01/27,Chennai Street Band shows us how to soul-search on the go,"Imagine going on a solo road trip one sunny Sunday morning, with the whole affair — right from meeting strangers and learning from their experience, to creating memories. It isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. It is something you would rather put off for another day. But Chennai-based musician Srihari Jagannathan decided one fine day to pack up, get on the road and take a journey that led him to his first album Payanangal.

“Life threw me a different spin. There’s a point in everybody’s life when you lose yourself. You don’t know where you are. I was completely lost. I started journalling my unexpressed emotions during my first solo trip. I bought this handmade paper diary in Varkala, and journalled around 400 pages... that became the album,” says Srihari. Payanangal, he adds, is a journey of a guy who has invested in a person, and that person has left, but towards the end of the album “he still feels whole”.

“He moves from a point where he projects his love onto somebody else to projecting it all onto himself,” says the Chennai Street Band frontman. On the guitars are Renin Raphael and Akshay Yesodharan. “It’s a concept album. There is a story going on throughout the album. That really got my attention. I’ve always wanted to do something like that,” says Renin, who hails from Delhi. The band includes Adithya Gopi on bass, Sebastian Satish on keys and sound engineer Nikhilesh.

Finding common ground

Though the band got its two guitarists on board recently, it thrives on the process of making music together. “Srihari gives us the liberty to listen to the song, read the lyrics, and play what we feel like... put our emotions to it and make it colourful,” says drummer Goutham Healer, who has been with the band since its inception. For Akshay, understanding what Jagannathan had in mind for the album when he joined the band last year was a journey in itself. “I got on board with the band and the album per se for the last three songs. At that point, I did not really understand the vision. But when I got into the studio, finished recording the acoustic and guitar parts, I thought to myself, ‘Now it makes sense.’ By the time we recorded the last song I got where he was coming from.”

Srihari says, “I underwent a transformation throughout the album myself. When I wrote ‘Mayavi’, the first person to listen to the song was the girl I meant it for. I recorded a one minute snippet and sent it to her and she cried. I felt that it was honest... It might not be a great musical piece, but if it has the right emotions, it works.” Renin remarks, “My favourite song [from the album] is ‘Ezhuva Maname’. It has a great guitar solo.”

Adds Srihari, “‘Ezhu Vaa’ is the toughest song that I wrote. At that time, I could not even wake up, I literally wanted to stop doing everything.” He wanted to motivate himself and was tired of listening to everybody else’s motivational songs. “I used to listen to Aerosmith’s ‘Dream On’ every day. But I wanted to write one for myself and that’s when ‘Ezhu Vaa’ happened. That’s the most special song personally for me. I realised that what I went through is probably common for everybody. There was a time when I was completely broken and didn’t have the energy to get up. And nobody quite understood it. But (after the trip) I was in a place with better perspective,” says Srihari.

The album recently debuted live at Bay 146 in Savera, Chennai, and is available on Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube. At the end of the day, Jagannathan says, “If you plug in the album on a day when you don’t feel great, and it comes and hugs you, I’ve done what I wanted to do with the album.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/e5wvui/article30662701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHENNAISTREETBAND3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/chennai-street-band-shows-us-how-to-soul-search-on-the-go/article30662703.ece
277,2020/01/27,Renovation of Madurai's Maiya Mandapam to be completed in two weeks,"Renovation of centuries-old Maiya Mandapam in the Vaigai near Albert Victor Bridge in Madurai will be completed in the next couple of weeks, according to officials of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department.

Joint Commissioner N. Natarajan said earlier the deities of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple used to be brought to the mandapam during the Tamil month of Maasi for ‘theerthavari’. “After many decades, the ritual will be performed at the mandapam this year, after the completion of restoration work,” he said.

The mandapam, which is an integral part of festivities associated with Madurai and the Vaigai, was in a dilapidated condition for many decades. “During the last century, the condition of the mandapam had deteriorated and the entire northern portion was in a decrepit state,” said an official.

Hence, the restoration of the mandapam was undertaken at a cost of around ₹1 crore after dismantling the entire structure, the official added.

Fifteen of the 36 original pillars, which were damaged, are now replaced. The pillars are arranged in six rows and six columns. “The stones have been chosen in such a way that they resemble the existing pillars,” he said.

The roof of the mandapam has been replaced with new slabs and cut stones will be used for the floor.

The Joint Commissioner said that retaining walls around the mandapam had also been constructed to prevent erosion due to the river water. “While digging the ground for the renovation work, we found portions of the retaining wall that had existed earlier. So, we connected those portions and built the wall,” he said.

“The mandapam used to be a spot for the residents to hang out. In the evenings, friends and families used to chat and spend time at the mandapam,” said B. Muthukumar, a resident of Sellur. “It would be great if officials make the mandapam usable for the public again,” he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/nf8qiu/article30670388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28MDUVAIGAIMAIYAMANDAPAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/renovation-of-maiya-mandapam-to-be-completed-in-two-weeks-madurai/article30668989.ece
278,2020/01/27,‘Shortage of skilled workforce a concern in clothing industry’,"A two-day international conference on skills for clothing sector, sponsored under Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) scheme and organised by Alagappa Institute of Skill Development of Alagappa University, Karaikudi, was inaugurated on January 22.

University Vice-Chancellor N. Rajendran, in his presidential address, said that clothing industry is one of the oldest sectors that contributes a major share to the Indian economy. He said that this is the second largest employer in the country after agricultural sector.

“Unprecedented technological transformations and a shortage of skilled workforce is a major concern for the industry. Hence, the focus must be to create an effective policy framework towards offering quality vocational training to the students during their graduation,” he said.

G.L.D. Wickramasinghe, former Vice-Chancellor of University of Vocational Technology, Sri Lanka, inaugurated the conference. In his address, he explained the modern trends and techniques used in global clothing sector. Further, he urged the students to develop interest towards research to develop good products and become successful entrepreneurs.

K. Murugesh Babu from the College of Textile and Clothing Engineering, Soochow University, China, delivered the keynote address.

In his address, he illustrated how the modern technological advancements like Computer Aided Design (CAD), Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality have changed the nature of the clothing sector.

During the conference, Alagappa Institute of Skill Development signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Anugraha Fashion Knitwear, a leading export industry in Tirupur.

281,2020/01/27,Declare Cauvery delta region as protected agricultural zone: PMK,"Tamil Nadu State Assembly should pass a resolution declaring Cauvery Delta region as a Protected Agricultural zone to safeguard the foodgrains bowl of the State, Pattali Makkal Katchi leader, Anbumani Ramadoss, said.

Talking to reporters here on Monday, Dr. Anbumani said that hydrocarbon projects would ruin the Delta region. After granting four licences for hydrocarbon extraction in 3,200 sq km in five Delta districts. Now announcement of granting licence for the fifth project covering 4,500 sq km has been made.

Stating that he himself has spoken against the Hydrocarban projects in Tamil Nadu with the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi and having raised the issue in the Parliament also several times, he said the only way to protect the Delta region was through a legislation declaring the Delta Region as a Protected Agricultural Zone where only agriculture and agri-related industries alone should be allowed.

To a question about several gram panchayats in Delta region having passed resolution against the Hydrocarbon project, Dr. Anbumani said that the government should respect the sentiments of the people.

Gram sabha meetings are recognised by the Constitution and their resolutions should be respected, he added.

Dr. Anbumani opposed imposing public examination on students of 5th class. Under the Right to Education Act, mandatory 100% pass up to 8th class was assured. However, the Centre had brought a change and thereby recommended that students of class 5 and 8 should take up public examination. “However, it is not mandatory for the State Governments to implement the recommendation,” he said.

Stating that failure of students would lead to drop outs in class five. Students might take up their family occupation. Public examination at 5th class will no way ensure higher quality of education, he said.

Instead, the State Government should improve the infrastructure of Government schools, employ quality teacher and implement quality teaching methodologies, he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/declare-cauvery-delta-region-as-protected-agricultural-zone-pmk/article30667871.ece

He was delivering V.R. Lakshmi Narayanan Memorial Lecture on ‘The role and rights of human rights defenders’ at SOCO Trust here on Monday. Mr. Parashar, who spent several years at the NHRC in various capacities, called for the State to protect human rights defenders at any cost. Mr. Parashar also said that the NHRC went through several transformations during his time there.

“In the initial stages, the NHRC came in for criticism for not including a woman member to oversee the proceedings. There was a threat of India’s invitation to the United Nations being withdrawn because we did not accommodate women then,” he said.

Though there had been women members since then, only in 2019 a provision to include a woman representative in the Commission was officially made.

The world of human rights defenders today was under threat as they were being attacked and faced threat while doing their work. “We have observed cases where people have been killed. The effective functioning of the NHRC can take place only if the State Human Rights Commission works in tandem,” he said.

He stressed that the State must provide compensation to victims on time and ensure speedy, transparent justice.

A section of the residents of Ilaththur village in the district had appealed to Collector G.K. Arun Sundar Thayalan to instruct the police to withdraw the case filed against 12 villagers for conducting temple function-related cultural programmes after 10 p.m.

In their petition, the Ilaththur villagers said the temple festival in the village was organised between January 3 and 5 and a debate was conducted as part of the celebration. When the ‘pattimantram’ got extended beyond 10 p.m., the police asked the organisers to wind up the programme. As the debate was conducted even after 10 p.m., the police, after 15 days, have registered a case against 12 persons from Ilaththur. Hence, the Collector should conduct an inquiry on this issue and ask the police to withdraw the case, the petitioners said, who also staged a demonstration before submitting the petition.

Congress functionary 68-year-old Chinnappan of Subramaniapuram in Sivagiri taluk, who came to the Collectorate with the party flag, threw the copies of his land document, saying that the officials were refusing to take action on his petition seeking cancellation of the forged documents with which five persons had usurped 10 acres of his land.

“Though I’m running from pillar to post for the past 15 years to cancel this forged document, the officials are supporting the culprits. If the officials still refuse to render justice to me, I’ll commit suicide right on the Collectorate premises,” Mr. Chinnappan said.

286,2020/01/27,‘Allow country boats to Katchatheevu church festival’,"RAMANATHAPURAM

Representatives from Traditional Fishermen Federation petitioned Collector K. Veera Rgahava Rao on Monday, seeking his intervention in stopping ticketed mechanized boats from taking pilgrims to the St. Antony’s Feast at Katchatheevu, scheduled to be held on March 6 and 7.

The fishermen stated that tourists are being fleeced with exorbitant ticket rates by unauthorized boat owners and demanded that country boats should be allowed instead.

“The traditional fishing boats measuring 40 feet in length and 12 feet in height is approved as per rules and can be taken for ferrying passengers, while mechanised boats are used only for fishing. The traditional boats were banned from taking pilgrims to the festival and we fought it in the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court to get it approved again,” said X. Chinnathambi, coordinator of the federation.

This will be the 10th year of the festival that resumed in 2010 after the Sri Lankan civil war that lasted from 1983 to 2009 and about 3000 pilgrims are expected to travel from India to Katchatheevu.

“Last year, we had about 2229 pilgrims and they were ferried in 63 mechanised and 15 country boats. Each boat will carry 30 pilgrims and five crew members,” said S. Devasakayam, Parish Priest, St. Joseph’s Church, Rameswaram, where applications are submitted for attending the festival.

“It’s impossible to ferry passenger without a ticket as it process involves fuel and food expenses for the boats and the crew apart from snacks and water for the passengers during the 2.5 hours ferry. The coordinating committee for the festival also involves fishermen representatives and every year, we taken them into consultation,” added the priest.

A ticket of ₹ 1,500 per person is collected and the application needs to be attached with a copy of the Adhaar card, a police verification certificate for people working in private firms and a no-objection certificate from the higher officials for government employees.

The age group of pilgrims is restricted from five to 70, due to safety issues and life jackets are provided for the travellers by the Fisheries department.

However, Mr. Chinnathambi said that there are agents who fleece tourists with ticket rates as high as ₹10,000 and above. “Over the years, the festival has attracted people from across the Country, including places in Kerala and Karanataka. The number of passengers is restricted every year and because of inflow of tourists, families of fishermen get relegated to a second place. We from the fishermen community have been going in country boats traditionally with our kith and kin without a ticket. We want to celebrate the festival in the traditional way without a fee on it,” he added.

This year, the invitation for the festival has been received from the Jaffna Bishop Rev. Justin B. Gnanaprakasam and the Collector is expected to convene a meeting in the coming weeks. The festival will commence on March 6 evening with flag-hoisting and a holy mass and adoration ceremony after which the feast mass will be conducted on March 7 morning.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/emszlm/article30667290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28RMD-BOAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/allow-country-boats-to-katchatheevu-church-festival/article30667291.ece

The ration card portability scheme under the ‘One nation, one ration card’, enabling the cardholders to buy the essential commodities from any ration shop across the country, will be introduced in the district on February 1, Collector Sandeep Nanduri has said.

Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Mr. Sandeep said the ‘One nation, one ration card’ scheme was to be introduced in the district in February as the scheme would be in force across the country from June 1 onwards. As the State government had agreed to this scheme, the Tamil Nadu Government had ordered for the trial run of this scheme in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts.

“Hence, the cardholders of the district can buy essential commodities from any ration shop in the district with their card. The difficulties, if any, to be identified during the trial run will be weeded out. The district administration has made arrangements for a meeting of the Taluk Supplies Officers and the officials from the Department of Cooperation for a comprehensive discussion to identify the problems and practical difficulties involved in this move,” Mr. Sandeep said.

Since the officials had no idea about the quantum of essential commodities to be sent to each ration shop in the wake of this trial run of ration card portability scheme, all shops would be provided with excess quantity of essential commodities to meet the demand. After the end of the trial run, the quantum of essential commodities to be sent to each ration shop would be determined based on the demand.

On the conduct of postponed indirect elections for the posts in rural local bodies, including for the posts of chairman and vice-chairman of Kovilpatti panchayat union, Mr. Sandeep said it would be held on January 30.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ration-card-portability-trial-run-in-thoothukudi-district-from-february-1/article30666653.ece
291,2020/01/27,Teppakulam getting ready for a ‘float’ festival this time,"MADURAI

Devotees and onlookers will see Meenakshi Sundareswar Temple’s decorated float move in a brimming Teppakulam after a long time on February 8.

Speaking to The Hindu, Joint Commissioner of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department N. Natarajan said that they had asked the makers of the float from Thanjavur to pay special attention to detail this time.

Every year, the festival is celebrated on the full moon day of the Tamil month of Thai, when presiding deities Goddess Meenakshi and Lord Sundareswarar are taken around the tank on a decorated float. This year, with water being diverted directly from the Vaigai, temple officials promise that it will be a sight to behold.

The bright and colourful float that usually attracts thousands of people to the Teppakulam every year had to be physically carried around the temple tank on foot due to the lack of water last year. Earlier, the temple administration had to pump water to a minimum of five feet in the tank covering an area of 1,000 ft x 950 ft to a depth of 14 feet.

“Although the tank reached its full level earlier in January, the level has depleted a bit now. We will draw more water to fill it soon, ensure proper lighting facility and erect high barricades. The float will also have to receive a stability certificate from Public Works Department,” Mr. Natarajan said.

He said that the police would be setting up watchtowers and public address systems at the site apart from patrolling the area to avoid any untoward incidents.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/teppakulam-getting-ready-for-a-float-festival-this-time-madurai/article30666554.ece
292,2020/01/27,Police thwart suicide bid by usury victims at Tirunelveli Collectorate,"TIRUNELVELI

The alert police and the fire and rescue services personnel stationed on the Collectorate premises thwarted suicide bid by two women, who, both usury victims, attempted to immolate themselves after pouring kerosene on them on Monday.

When the people started entering the Collectorate with petitions, two women standing near the District Development Council Hall, where the weekly grievance day meeting would usually be held, poured kerosene on them and tried to light the matches. However, the police and the fire and rescue services personnel, who would be stationed there on Mondays to thwart suicide attempts, acted swiftly to thwart their self-immolation bid.

Police, who picked up M. Krishnaveni, 31, and her co-sister P. Bama, 29, of Chidambarapuram near Kalakkad in the district for interrogation, said the women had borrowed ₹ 2.40 lakh from two women from the same area for a business venture. Though they reportedly had repaid ₹ 7 lakh towards principal and the interest, the usurers were threatening them to settle the loan they had availed.

“We’ve repaid over ₹ 7 lakh for the ₹ 2.40 lakh we’d borrowed. When the moneylenders started threatening us, we filed complaints with the Kalakkad Police Station. Since the police did not take any action against the usurers, we decided to end our life on the Collectorate premises,” Krishnaveni said.

Even as the police were taking the women to their vehicle after pouring water on them, District Revenue Officer B. Muthuramalingam, who was on his way to the grievance redressal meet, inquired about the women.

As Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish also came down from her chamber to walk towards the District Development Council Hall for the meeting, she inquired about their grievances and advised them not to take extreme steps to end their life.

She also assured them that the police concerned would conduct an impartial investigation on their earlier petitions to render them justice.

Since the visitors are thoroughly frisked by the police at the main entrance of the Collectorate after a usury victim set afire his wife and two children before killing himself in a similar fashion on the Collectorate premises in October 2017, the women had sneaked into the Collectorate through a small opening made to facilitate ongoing construction activities.

Even as the ruckus caused by the sisters was subsiding, Chitrai from Alangulam, who had also come along with his son to submit a petition, fell down suddenly on the ground saying that she had chewed and eaten the seeds of a poisonous plant grown on the Collectorate premises as an ornamental plant for its beautiful flowers. He was rushed to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital immediately in an ambulance.

293,2020/01/27,‘Take stringent action against attackers at toll plaza’,"TIRUNELVELI

Functionaries of various outfits here have jointly appealed to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish to book cases under stringent sections of law against those who attacked a group of people from Kerala at Nanguneri toll plaza on Sunday.

Led by M. Eranian of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, a group of party cadre affiliated to various outfits, submitted a petition seeking action. The petitioners said a gang, reportedly working with the Nanguneri toll plaza, had verbally abused them with clubs, had been booked under ordinary sections instead of invoking punitive sections against the attackers.

When P. Kannappan was the Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tirunelveli range, he, following a similar unpleasant incident, made it mandatory that everyone posted at this toll plaza should get ‘police verification certificate’ before being stationed there for toll collection, he said.

Moreover, everyone should wear identity card while on duty at the toll plaza, he pointed out.

‘Stop work’

A group of residents from Kumaresan Nagar on Thiyagaraja Nagar Extension in ward 19 submitted a petition seeking the Collector’s intervention to stop the ongoing preliminary work on the construction of underground drainage pumping station in their area. The petitioners said a public utility land at the entrance of their area had been allotted for the construction of underground drainage pumping station.

Since the public utility land in the low lying area would usually witness water stagnation during rainy season, the proposed pumping station would make the situation from bad to worse to cause unbearable foul odour and spreading of contagious diseases.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/55pme8/article30666301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA28TVL-WARD19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/take-stringent-action-against-attackers-at-toll-plaza/article30666302.ece

They were speaking at a grievance redressal meeting on Monday.

Treasurer of the association P. Thavamani Devi, said that young students of the Denotified Tribes community were to receive ₹ 1,000 a month for their education as scholarship. “However, officials at the District Administration and the School Education Department do not know where one can procure scholarship application forms. If this basic need is not addressed, how are we expected to grow in the field of education and find jobs?” she asked.

She added that though the Central government promised to care for Hindus, her community was being looked down upon. “We are probably not Hindu enough. We are asserting our rights after many years and this is not being appreciated by the Centre and the State governments,” she said.

Ms. Devi said that many DNT children come from socially and economically backward homes. “Many of these children have only single parents or are cared for by their grandparents. How are they expected to continue studying when they are in abject poverty?” she asked.

The members sought immediate assistance from the district administration.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hm3i57/article30665459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27JANTH--DENOTIFIED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/scholarships-for-children-from-denotified-tribes-sought-in-madurai/article30665460.ece

At the grievance redressal meeting on Monday, District Secretary, M. Xavier Irudhayaraj of the party said that at least 25,000 acres of Panchami land in Madurai were being held by members of different castes. “Legislators and bureaucrats all over Tamil Nadu act like they are empathetic to the Dalit struggle and want to eradicate untouchability. However, everyone talks and never acts,” he said. He added that apart from not providing Panchami lands in villages, rural upper castes continue to use derogatory slang against SC residents.

K. B. Karthikeyan, the party’s legal representative, said that the situation is not any better in cities. “In Ellis Nagar in Madurai, areas which are being termed as encroachments by the Madurai Corporation, are mostly Dalit settlements. The supposed notices sent by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board to these houses do not possess any statutory provisions under which the encroachments are to be removed,” he said.

The police said that the accused had plotted to murder a rival in the recently-concluded rural local body elections.

The police said that five men, identified as Selvakumar (40), Ramalingam (40), Murugan (28), Anthony and Athimuthu (28), were allegedly hired by Selvamary, the daughter of Rajamani, the newly-elected village Panchayat president of O. Karisalkulam village in Kamuthi Union. The men were hired to kill Pandi who had contested against Rajamani and lost in the elections. Pandi had filed a case in court challenging the victory of Rajamani, due to which enmity brewed between the two parties, said the police.

On Sunday, upon receiving information about the weapons concealed in a secret place in Thoppadaipatti village, near Kamuthi, the police conducted a search and found the rifle and billhooks. “The men and Selvamary have been arrested and police personnel have been posted in the village to monitor the tense situation as the opposite gang could indulge in violence,” said a senior official.

Member of Parliament (Rajya Sabha) T.K. Rangarajan said India must inculcate compulsory sports and fitness in education like China and Jamaica.

But the trend was reversing in schools with additional stress on academics, Mr. Rangarajan said, adding there was abundant talent that could be shaped well here. He was speaking at the valedictory of the sixth edition Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) sports meet here on Sunday.

“It is wonderful to see that a State-level sporting event of such a large scale being conducted in Madurai. In the future, sports must reach every union and every village. Students from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes should be encouraged to take sports seriously,” he said.

He said sports provided a means for students to learn important life lessons and gave them the opportunity to get government jobs. Supporting this view, former Communist Party of India MLA N. Nanmaran said opportunities for training and representing India at the national level must be given to fisherfolk and children from the streets who performed gymnastics to earn their daily bread.

“They have natural talent. Why look beyond them?” he asked. He also said female athletes in the meet were tremendously fast and must grow to eventually represent the country at international meets.

Mr. Nanmaran and Mr. Rangarajan congratulated the winners in various categories, including under 12, under 16 and under 18 categories. “The fact that the event highlighted the ill-effects of drug abuse must be lauded,” said Mr. Rangarajan.

301,2020/01/27,Those opposed to India are funding anti-CAA protests: MP,"Those opposed to India and terrorist organisations have been funding the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests, Member of Parliament Shobha Karandlaje said here on Monday. Speaking at the “Jana Jagruti Samavesha” in support of CAA, Ms. Karandlaje said that there are reports that ₹ 120 crore was deposited in 73 bank accounts of those associated with People’s Front of India for the anti-CAA protests. “An inquiry is already on and facts will come out shortly,” she said.

Union Minister for Chemicals and Fertilizers D.V. Sadananda Gowda accused the Congress of launching a proxy protest against CAA using the Social Democratic Party of India, PFI and other organisations. Rumours are being spread to create fear among minorities.

“We are keeping a close watch on these activities. The Union government will take appropriate action,” he said and added that there was no question of going back on the implementation of CAA. The Act shows the humane face of India in handling the issue of persecuted minority communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, he said.

State BJP president and Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel said that by mocking at the tough action of the police against the violent protests here on December 19, the former Chief Ministers Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy have brought down the confidence of the police force. This was nothing but an anti-national act, he said.

District in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojari said that those who threw stones and petrol-filled bottles on the police by wearing masks on December 19 cannot be called as innocents.

302,2020/01/27,‘States passing resolutions against CAA are committing a blunder against Constitution’,"Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday said that States that are adopting resolutions not to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act are committing a blunder against the Constitution and exhorted them not to commit such a mistake.

Speaking at the “Jana Jagruthi Samavesha” organised to create awareness on CAA by the Bharatiya Janata Party here, Mr. Singh advised States to desist from doing so. He said that Mahatma Gandhi had asked the then Prime Minister late Jawaharlal Nehru to grant citizenship to religious minorities coming from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The Modi-led NDA government at the Centre was only fulfilling the wish of Mahatma Gandhi now, he added.

Mr. Singh brushed aside the charge that Muslims from these three countries were not being offered citizenship stating they were theocratic States representing Islam. In such an event, Muslims in those countries were not subjected to religious persecution, the Minister said. On the other hand, India that respects all religions has been a secular country where all the 72 sects of Islam co-existed, he added.

The Minister said that concerted efforts were being made to create a division between Hindus and Muslims in the name of CAA and urged the BJP cadre to reach out to Muslims to enlighten them about the provisions of the Act.

Muslims assured

Stating that fear was being created among Muslims about the National Register of Citizenship, Mr. Singh said that the Union government was yet to take it up for discussion. “Nobody can touch Indian Muslims and throw them out. If any Muslim faces such a situation, the BJP would stand by him,” he assured. There was no question of snatching away the citizenship of 130 crore people of India, he asserted.

The Minister noted that the Modi-led government has given citizenship to over 600 Muslims, including singer Adnan Sami, who have come over from other countries in the last six years.

About the National Population Register (NPR), Mr. Singh said that the exercise was started in 2010 by the United Progressive Alliance-led government at the Centre.

The State government has been reaching out to farmers, fishermen, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, minorities, women and backward classes. Each one of these sections of society were direct beneficiaries of various government schemes, he said. A lot of importance, he said, was being given to improving the livelihood of fishermen . The State government took a decision to pay ₹ 60.54 crore towards waiving loan taken by 23,000 fisherwomen in the coastal belt. As many as 1,291 country boats received ₹ 7.92 lakh litres of kerosene in Dakshina Kannada between April 2019 and September 2019.

312,2020/01/27,From selling oranges to winning a Padmashri,"Harekala Hajabba did not make much of his presence at the Republic Day celebrations at the Nehru Maidan here on Sunday. He had been invited by the district administration for felicitations as he was among others in the State chosen for the Padmashri award.

Like during the earlier felicitations and award ceremonies, Mr. Hajabba, a wayside orange seller who founded a government school in his village out of donations collected, funds from the government and his contributions, was more focussed about the school. While thanking elected representatives and officials who greeted him at the Nehru Maidan, Mr. Hajabba was seeking their help to get a pre-university college for his village. At present, the village has a government school for classes 1 to 10. He wanted the help of the Revenue Department for a survey of 1.3 acres of land purchased by him out of the ₹ 5 lakh cash prize he received for the school.

He did not want the children of his village to have difficulty in speaking English as he has faced. “This is a dream I still continue to pursue. Whatever cash awards I get, I spend them on the school,” he said.

His selection for the Padmashri, Mr. Hajabba said, came as a surprise. “I was in a queue at the ration shop to get 35 kg rice at noon (on Saturday) when I received the call from New Delhi. I could not understand much as the caller spoke in Hindi. I handed over my mobile phone to autorickshaw driver Abbas who was standing nearby. He also could not understand much but only said that I had been conferred with the Padmashri award,” he said.

To get confirmation, Mr. Hajabba said, he came all the way to Mangaluru to meet a senior journalist, whom he knows. It was at 4 p.m. when he returned home that he got confirmation about his award. “All these awards are being given by God. I did not imagine that a person from a poor background will be selected for such a coveted award,” Mr. Hajabba said, with all humbleness

To a question whether his usual white shirt and white dhoti will change when he goes to receive the award, he said, “No way.” Mr. Hajabba added: “As I have done earlier, I will go in my usual attire.”

Hajabba thanked the Union and State governments, the elected representatives, officials and media for supporting his cause.

Harekala Hajabba, who is in his 60s now, has been eking out a living by selling oranges at the Central Market here. One day, a foreigner asked him the price of a kg of orange. He could not answer the query as he did not know English. Mr. Hajabba did not want the children of his Harekala village, on the outskirts of Mangaluru, to face a similar situation and decided to start a primary school.

The school was started in a madrasa in June 1999. Later, it became a government school where classes till 10 are being held now. Mr. Hajabba has built the school with grants from the government and from donors. Initially, he contributed ₹ 5,000, which was his savings from selling oranges. He had ensured that the school got more than one acre land.

He bagged the CNN IBN’s Real Heros Award in 2009. The ₹ 5 lakh cash award he received was used to purchase land for the school.

Mr. Hajabba’s achievement has become a subject of study in under-graduate courses in Mangalore, Davangere and Kuvempu universities. In addition, Kannada-medium schools in Kerala have been teaching about him for Class 8 and Class 10 students.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/b5axyf/article30660476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27MNHAREKALAHAJABBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/from-selling-oranges-to-winning-a-padmashri/article30660477.ece

The company had reported a ₹485 crore net profit during the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal. Total revenue grew by 14% to ₹4,384 crore from the ₹3,850 crore reported during the year-ago period.

“The profits were impacted due to a trigger-based impairment charge taken on a few products, including generic gNuvaring.

The current quarter’s performance has been good across all our businesses and we achieved strong EBITDA margins,” said Saumen Chakraborty, chief financial officer, DRL, adding the erosion in the value of gNuvaring led to an impairment charge of ₹1,113 crore while the same for other products was ₹206 crore, taking the total impairment to ₹ 1,320 crore.

The company, however, achieved the highest-ever quarterly revenue without any one-offs during the third quarter.

This could be seen from the fact that earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation grew by 24.1% while margin rose by 24.5%. Profit before tax would be at ₹793 crore, excluding the impairment.

DRL registered an increase in revenue from India, Europe, North America and emerging markets driven by new product launches. It ended the quarter with a net cash surplus of ₹414 crore and was considering inorganic growth in some spaces as an option.

The expenditure on R&D was ₹395 crore accounting for 9% of sales.

314,2020/01/27,Daimler unveils BS-VI BharatBenz vehicles,"Daimler India Commercial Vehicles (DICV) on Monday unveiled its all-new range of BS-VI compliant BharatBenz vehicles, the prices of which will be announced later.

The new product portfolio, comprising over a dozen medium and heavy duty trucks and buses, is now available for pre-bookings and will be introduced in the market depending on the fuel availability in each region.

Top company officials said the range may be priced 10 to 15% more than BS-IV models as the material cost in the new models have been significantly higher. But the BS-VI products are 10% more fuel efficient than BS-IV units and the annual maintenance contracts of BS-VI models costs 6% less than the BS-IV models.

Satyakam Arya, MD and CEO, DICV, said, “BharatBenz’s new CV range offers Indian customers the solution they need for the future, setting new benchmarks for medium and heavy duty trucks with improved fuel efficiency, safety and connectivity.”

Daimler’s new generation of CVs are packed with industry-leading fuel efficiency, safety, comfort and reliability, the company said.

With the new generation of BharatBenz trucks, DICV has decided to move away from the traditional tonnage classification. Instead, it will focus on customising vehicles for use applications and targeting specific sectors such as e-commerce.

The company said its buses would come with the new electrical and electronic architecture ‘ETec’ that offers an advanced human interface, easy fault detection and next-generation electronics. The BharatBenz trucks and buses will be powered by OM926 engine and 4D34i. The key differentiator in technology will be the after-treatment systems used in the vehicles.

The company’s trucks come with a up to six-year standard warranty and industry-best extended warranty of up to eight8 years. The trucks 20% percent longerwill have service intervals up to 20 percent longer.

For complying with BS-VI norms, the company leveraged Daimler’s global network of technological expertise to quickly and efficiently localise proven Euro6 technologies for use in the Indian market.

With a ₹500-crore investment, DICV developed new facilities and over 1,000 new parts for BS-VI, all this while achieving localisation of above 80%, company officials said.

In addition to completing over 5.2 million kilometers of BS VI testing in India, DICV is also gearing up its after-sales network with learnings from other markets.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/b9olav/article30668804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27thBUDICVFrom-L-to-R---Mr-Thomas-FrickeDaimler-Buses-India-Mr-Satyak,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/daimler-unveils-bs-vi-bharatbenz-vehicles/article30668805.ece

As part of the strategy, the company will be focussing on Nissan as its primary brand, Nissan Motor India managing director Rakesh Srivastava said. However, Datsun brand will not be discontinued.

“We are re-orienting out strategy. The revival in sales will happen by bringing newer products in the market. For that, going forward, Nissan will become primary brand for us. It will have multiple product introductions. Nissan will drive our business,” Mr. Srivastava said.

He added that while product roadmap for both brands – Nissan and Datsun – were being firmed up, this year, the company would be bringing in an all-new compact SUV. “It will be a global product that will first be introduced in the Indian market. We plan to launch at least one new product every year going forward.”

Asked about Datsun, Mr. Srivastava said, “Datsun will continue to co-exist. For Datsun, the global direction is that Nissan being a global brand will continue to work worldwide and Datsun will become the responsibility of the hosting nation. And they need to take decisions on products. So, it will not be global call, but our call.”

Datsun currently contributes about 70% of the vehicle sales for the company.

While Mr. Srivastava stressed that the company is targeting to build a ‘profitable and sustainable business’ in India, he did not give any timeline for it.

In September 2018, Nissan had announced its ‘MOVE 2022’ strategy to position Nissan as premium mainstream brand in India building on the company’s SUV heritage. As part of it, it had launched SUV Kicks last year. On the transition to BS-VI, he added that Nissan would not offer small diesel engines, but was working on its line-up for both petrol and bigger diesel engine vehicles to comply with the new emission norm.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/tltkd/article30668379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THBURAKESH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/nissan-to-revive-india-business-continue-datsun/article30668380.ece

Russia claims that this nuclear-armed HGV can fly at over 20 times the speed of sound and is capable of such manoeuvring as to be “invulnerable to interception by any existing and prospective missile defence means of the potential adversary”. With this induction, it appears that Russia has beaten the U.S. and China in deploying the HGV. But China and the U.S. are also close on the heels: the U.S. has moved from the research to the development stage, and China demonstrated the DF-17, a medium-range missile with the HGV, at the military parade in October 2019. The induction of such capability is inevitable in the next few years. But is it going to be a game changer?

A hypersonic delivery system is essentially a ballistic or cruise missile that can fly for long distances and at speeds higher than 5 Mach at lower altitudes. This allows it to evade interception from current Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD). It can also execute a high degree of manoeuvres.

Fearful that U.S. BMD that can intercept ballistic missiles would erode their nuclear deterrence, Russia and China had been in search of such a capability ever since the U.S. walked out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty in 2002. Believing that hypersonic HGVs and hypersonic cruise missiles will re-establish lost strategic stability, Russia has declared such missiles as nuclear capable, while China has declared them dual-use capable. On the other hand, the U.S. explains this capability mainly for attacking time-sensitive targets as part of its prompt global strike strategy and hence has designated them a conventional role.

Risks of misperception

How would the induction of hypersonics complicate security concerns? First, we must realise that these missiles are being added to the military capabilities of countries that possess nuclear weapons. For these nations, the concern is always an attack on nuclear assets to degrade retaliation. Another layer of complication is added by the fact that these missiles bring in warhead and destination ambiguities. In both cases, when an adversary’s early warning detects such missiles headed in its direction, but cannot be sure whether they are conventional or nuclear-armed, nor ascertain the target they are headed towards, the tendency would be to assume the worst. For an adversary that faces a country with a BMD but itself has a small nuclear arsenal, it would fear that even conventionally armed hypersonic missiles could destroy a portion of its nuclear assets. The tendency could then be to shift to more trigger-ready postures such as launch on warning or launch under attack to ostensibly enhance deterrence. But such shifts would also bring risks of misperception and miscalculation in moments of crisis.

Offence-defence spiral

Second, the induction of hypersonics would lead to an offence-defence spiral. According to reports, the U.S. has begun finding ways of either strengthening its BMD or looking for countermeasures to defeat hypersonics, besides having an arsenal of its own of the same kind. The stage appears set for an arms race instability given that the three major players in this game have the financial wherewithal and technological capability to play along. This looks particularly imminent in the absence of any strategic dialogue or arms control.

A third implication would be to take offence-defence developments into outer space. Counter-measures to hypersonics have been envisaged through placement of sensors and interceptors in outer space. While none of this is going to be easy or quick, weaponisation of outer space would, neverthless, be a distinct possibility once hypersonic inductions become the norm.

Thus induction of this technology would likely prove to be a transitory advantage eventually leading nations into a strategic trap. India needs to make a cool-headed assessment of its own deterrence requirements and choose its pathways wisely.

322,2020/01/27,Black and grey: On terror funding and Pakistan,"The deliberations, in Beijing, of the Asia-Pacific joint group of the global watchdog on terror financing and money laundering, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), gave Pakistan some encouraging news: that it had progressed in its efforts to avoid a blacklisting. A final decision will be taken at a plenary meeting of the body, expected in Paris next month: in keeping Pakistan on the current “grey list”, downgrading it to a “black list”, or letting it off altogether for the moment. The 39-member body had determined that Pakistan was to be placed on the grey list in 2018, and presented it a 27-point list of actions. These included freezing the funds of UN Security Council entities such as 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed and the LeT, the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other Taliban-affiliated groups. The actions entailed a sustained effort to bring legal action against these groups, and also called for changes to Pakistani law in line with global standards for measures against money laundering and financing terrorism. Unlike in October 2019, when Pakistan had completed five points, the Beijing meeting has cleared it on 14 points. While Pakistan’s progress will come as a disappointment to India — it wants more scrutiny of Pakistan’s support to terror groups lest Islamabad feels it has been let off the hook — there are a few points to consider. First, the grey listing is not new. Pakistan was placed on it in 2012, and was removed in 2015 after it passed a National Action Plan to deal with terrorism following the 2014 Peshawar School massacre. It was also placed under severe restrictions in the years 2008-2012, after the Mumbai attack. Second, this last grey list period has already seen some Indian demands met, including the chargesheeting of Hafiz Saeed for terror financing, and the addition of JeM chief Masood Azhar to the UNSC 1267 list. Finally, although the FATF is a technical organisation, there is no doubting that geopolitics and bilateral deals play a part in deciding outcomes.

As a result, New Delhi must study the politics behind Pakistan’s FATF “progress”. Officials have suggested that Pakistan’s role in ensuring Taliban talks are brought to a successful conclusion soon may have weighed with the U.S. and its allies in the grouping. Other countries may have determined that with China in the president’s chair, and the backing of Turkey and Malaysia, Pakistan could escape being blacklisted in any case, and dropped the effort. India’s recent troubles on the international stage, including the UNSC where China has been allowed to raise the Kashmir issue twice in five months, after nearly five decades, may also be a reason its objections at the Beijing discussions were not considered as carefully as in the past.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/black-and-grey-on-terror-funding-and-pakistan/article30659873.ece
323,2020/01/27,Dubious decision: On NIA takeover of Bhima Koregaon case,"The Home Ministry’s abrupt decision to transfer the investigation into the Bhima Koregaon cases in Maharashtra to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is an unwarranted interference in the police powers of the State. It is clearly aimed at preventing the new regime in Maharashtra from reviewing the controversial probe done under the BJP-led government through a Special Investigation Team of its own. The Pune police have filed a charge sheet against known rights defenders and activists on the grave charge of being part of a Maoist plot against the government, basing their claim on purported material seized from computers during raids. What began as a case relating to alleged provocative speeches during the ‘Elgar Parishad’, an event held on December 31, 2017, to commemorate a military victory of Dalits against the Peshwa army 200 years earlier, followed by some incidents of violence, was then transformed into a sinister plot to overthrow the government, allegedly at the behest of the Communist Party of India (Maoist). The police conducted raids across the country and named some activists and lawyers in the FIR. Even though there was an outlandish claim based on a letter of doubtful authenticity that there was an assassination plot against the Prime Minister, this allegation did not find place in the FIR, or remand applications. Despite its inter-State ramifications, the State government vehemently opposed a petition in the Supreme Court for a court-monitored independent probe. At that time, the Centre, also helmed by the BJP, expressed no inclination to hand over the probe to the NIA, even though sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) were invoked.

Significantly, the Supreme Court, by a 2-1 majority, declined to intervene with the police probe, remaining unmoved by the arguments of scholars such as Romila Thapar and Prabhat Patnaik that it was an attempt to hound rights defenders and suppress political dissent. The Union government cannot now turn around and claim that it is a fit case for an NIA probe. A provision in the NIA Act does allow the Centre to give a suo motu direction to the NIA to take over any investigation, if offences listed in a schedule to the Act are committed. The Centre’s suo motu power is likely to be tested for its constitutionality when Chhattisgarh’s suit against the NIA comes up. The episode highlights fears expressed by some States that their police power would be compromised if the NIA was established. But what is legally questionable now is not the Centre’s power, but whether such a decision is tenable at this stage, long after it became common knowledge that an offence under UAPA had taken place and its ramifications known. The inevitable conclusion is that the Centre’s intervention is a ploy to continue the political narrative that the lawyers and activists sympathetic towards the cause of tribal people in conflict-hit areas are ‘urban Naxals’ or Maoists.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dubious-decision-the-hindu-editorial-on-nia-taking-over-bhima-koregaon-case-probe/article30659880.ece
324,2020/01/27,Varthur lake to be rejuvenated at an estimated cost of ₹119 crore,"After Bellandur lake, the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) has finally called for tenders for the rejuvenation and development of the downstream Varthur lake at an estimated cost of ₹119 crore.

According to BDA officials, rejuvenation of the lake will be taken up in two phases. In the first phase, the lake would be desilted. In the second phase, the bund of the lake will be strengthened, a wet land will be formed, an idol-immersion tank will be constructed, lights and CCTVs will be installed. “A park and an amphitheatre are also planned. Everything will be done keeping ecology, flora and fauna in mind,” the official said.

Senior officials of the BDA said the work is expected to be completed in 18 months, excluding the monsoon; and the rejuvenation is expected to done within 22 months.

Speaking to The Hindu, K. Mahadevegowda of BDA said they were following the NGT committee orders. “As per the NGT committee directions, we have already started draining out water from the Varthur lake and it is expected to be completed within 20 days. We have also made sure that no sewage enters the lake,” he said.

NGT committee

The BDA has been pulled up by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) time and again for failing to rejuvenate the lake. The NGT appointed a committee to oversee the protection and rejuvenation of Agara, Bellandur and Varthur lakes in December 2018.

In its report submitted to the NGT in September last year, the committee pulled up the government over ‘patent non-compliance in critical areas’ in matters relating to the highly polluted Bellandur, Agara and Varthur lakes.

Earlier this month, BDA called the tender for rejuvenation of Bellandur lake with an estimated cost of ₹250 crore.

Santosh Hegde, former Lokayukta, who also is heading the committee for rejuvenation of Bellandur and Varthur lakes appointed by the NGT, said the panel would closely monitor the rejuvenation work of both the lakes and submit reports to the NGT.

“We have called a meeting regarding the progress in the first week of February. We will get a clear picture, including detailed information on the tender,” he said. He also said the NGT had directed him to submit a progress report by the end of March.

U.V. Singh, member of the committee, said the committee has made various recommendations regarding rejuvenation, including desilting, fencing, clearing encroachments. “There are certain works that need to be completed by the end of March. By calling the tender, the BDA has followed the directions given by the NGT,” he said.

Scientific process

Residents are hoping for the rejuvenation process to begin at the earliest and be done scientifically. Vishnu Prasad of Bellandur Development Forum said the rejuvenation work should be done in consultation with ecologists, geologists, hydro-geologists.

Today last date for Bellandur tender

The last day to bid for the tenders called to rejuvenate Bellandur lake is Tuesday.

Speaking about clearing encroachments in Bellandur lake, U.V. Singh, member of the NGT committee, said most of the encroachments around the lake have been cleared. Various agencies, including, BBMP, BWSSB, Minor Irrigation Department, were a part of the process and their co-operation was vital in the rejuvenation, he added.

BDA officials said draining out of water from Bellandur was almost complete. “There is a patch of defence land towards one side of the lake where the water diversion is yet to be completed. We have written to them regarding it and will be completing the work soon. That apart, water diverting work is complete,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/8oqm10/article30668484.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGVARTHURLAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/varthur-lake-to-be-rejuvenated-at-an-estimated-cost-of-119-crore/article30668486.ece
325,2020/01/27,Alarm foils ATM robbery bid; two arrested,"An alarm that went off in the ATM kiosk as it was cut open by robbers not only helped the police prevent the robbery, but has also led to three earlier cases being cracked.

In the wee hours of Sunday, the city police control room received a call from the State Bank of India that one of their ATMs around Mysuru Road was probably being burgled. The message was soon relayed to the police on night patrol.

“We had no specific information which ATM kiosk was being burgled. So multiple Hoysala response teams went checking all SBI ATM kiosks in the larger area around Mysuru Road,” said B Ramesh, DCP (West).

One of the teams found shutters pulled down on one of the SBI ATM kiosks and the cops found fire sparks coming from inside. Alerted by this, they broke open the door to find that two men who had broken open the ATM using a gas cutter and had accessed the money inside – ₹15.04 lakh. The duo tried to attack the cops with an iron rod, but were soon overpowered and apprehended.

The arrested have been identified as Harsha Arora, 41 and Sarabjit, 40, both hailing from Punjab. “The duo pasted chewing gum on the CCTV cameras in the ATM kiosk and sprayed it with black paint to ensure their faces were not captured by the cameras. They had used a gas cutter to cut open the machine and accessed the money. They would have fled from the scene in a matter of minutes. Our team reached there in the nick of time,” Mr. Ramesh said.

The duo came to the city three months ago and claimed to have been working in a private firm, which was yet to be verified, sources said.

Their interrogation has revealed that the duo were involved in three ATM robberies, one of which was successful. “They have now confessed to have carried out the ATM robbery in Parappana Agrahara on January 2 earlier this year where ₹23.05 lakh was stolen. The duo have also attempted to rob two ATM kiosks in the city, but failed. These cases are being probed,” a senior police official said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/alarm-foils-atm-robbery-bid-two-arrested/article30668076.ece
326,2020/01/27,BBMP to write to IAF over chopper kicking up dust on Republic Day,"Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar will write to the Indian Air Force on the incident of a helicopter that showered flower petals on the podium, as a welcome gesture on Republic Day, but flew too low resulting in a dust storm.

This occurred after Governor Vajubhai Vala unfurled the national flag at Maneshaw Parade Grounds in the city.

The helicopter, which flew low over the podium and showered flowers as is customary, kicked up dust — up to 10-15 feet high — as Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, DG Neelamani Raju, Mr. Anil Kumar and City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao were on the podium.

Mr. Yediyurappa was reportedly upset over the incident. Dignitaries on the podium and others next to the podium, besides hundreds of spectators were seen protecting themselves from the dust storm which engulfed them.

Mr. Anil Kumar said, “The low flying of the chopper not only violated the VIP safety zone but also disturbed the event due to the small dust storm it created.” He also said the chopper had not taken part in the three day rehearsal, including the full dress rehearsal, citing weather.

A police official, who was at the spot, said the chopper flew lower than normal. Another official reasoned that the chopper must have flown low to avoid birds.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-to-write-to-iaf-over-chopper-kicking-up-dust-on-republic-day/article30668032.ece
327,2020/01/27,HC asks BMRCL not to shift or cut trees as per expert panel’s ‘permission’,"The Karnataka High Court on Monday directed the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL) not to act upon the permission, purportedly given by an expert committee, either to cut or relocate trees for metro project without the prior approval of the court.

A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar, pointed out that the BMRCL had relocated some trees based on the “permission” given by the expert committee but the counsel could not produce the copies of the permission.

Also, neither the State government nor the BBMP were able to immediately produce a copy of the “permission” given to the BMRCL or the decision taken by the committee on BMRCL’s application.

The Bench issued the direction during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Dattatraya T. Devare and Bangalore Environment Trust.

Meanwhile, the Bench directed the government to explain its conduct of unilaterally separating Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural areas from the BBMP jurisdiction for the purpose of appointing the tree officer without taking permission of the court.

It was pointed out by petitioner’s counsel that the government issued a notification on January 14, 2020, separating Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural district for the purpose of Karnataka Preservation of Trees (KPT) Act, 1976.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-asks-bmrcl-not-to-shift-or-cut-trees-as-per-expert-panels-permission/article30667800.ece
328,2020/01/27,Republic facing its fourth crisis: Ramachandra Guha,"The Indian Republic, as it completes seven decades, is living through its fourth big crisis, historian Ramachandra Guha said while delivering a lecture, ‘The Republic at 70’, at Bengaluru International Centre on Sunday.

He said the earlier three crises were in the 1960s, which saw the death of two Prime Ministers, India being defeated by China and food shortage; the Emergency of the 1970s; and the rise of communalism in the early 1990s.

Exploring the contours of this crisis, Mr. Guha listed four aspects: deepening religious divisions, persistence of social inequality, growing environmental degradation and decline in autonomy of democratic public institutions.

He termed the deepening religious divisions the most grave threat. “We have a majority of people today who think we should be a Hindu country, and Hindus have really become a majority with a minority complex. This is manifested in the most blatantly discriminatory Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The CAA will change the very character of India.”

Uniform civil code

He was also critical of the Congress, especially Rajiv Gandhi, who, in the 1980s, ‘lost an opportunity’ to usher in uniform civil code, but instead wilted and ceded ground to Hindutva. He termed the period from 1989-1993, which saw the rise of communalism, riots, destruction of Babri Masjid and economic crisis, as one of the earlier crisis the republic had been through.

The undermining of public institutions, including the RBI, the Army and the Election Commission of India in recent times, he said, was another fault line of the crisis that the republic faces today. He drew comparison to the Emergency in the 1970s, which he termed the second crisis the republic faced. But he said he was sceptical of the ‘hyperbole’ comparing the situation today to Nazi Germany. He said the present crisis was not apocalyptic yet, and said the republic had been through such crises before and had come out of it.

He said federalism, with many States outside the Bharatiya Janata Party’s grip today, unlike during the Emergency when most States were ruled by the Congress, was a bulwark against creeping authoritarianism.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/290ot/article30662602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THGUHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/republic-facing-its-fourth-crisis-ramachandra-guha/article30662603.ece

331,2020/01/27,"Nearly, 68,000 commuters used Chennai Metro’s share car and share auto services in December","Chennai Metro Rail’s feeder service has been witnessing a gradual increase in the number of people travelling through share car and share autorickshaw services. In the last month, there has been a 5% increase in the total number of commuters who used these last mile connectivity services -- share car and share autorickshaw.

From 64,774 passengers in November, the numbers went up marginally to 67,963 in December. Share car and share autorickshaw services have been running for a flat fare of ₹10 and ₹5 respectively from various stations including Koyambedu, Anna Nagar East, Alandur, Thirumangalam, St. Thomas Mount, Vadapalani, AG-DMS, Arumbakkam, Nehru Park, Kilpauk, Saidapet and Chennai airport, taking commuters in and around these stations.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the patronage has been increasing the past few months, particularly because of Chennai airport station. “We get nearly 12,000 passengers travelling a month. These commuters usually come from various areas like Pammal, Chrompet and recently, we provided connectivity to MEPZ too.

333,2020/01/27,Writers fighting their way back into relevance in Tamil cinema,"The Tamil film industry, which was once driven by powerful scripts and dialogues, is slowly exploring ways to put writers back in the driver’s seat. While busy production houses such as S.R. Prabhu’s Dream Warrior Productions and S. Sashikanth’s YNOT Studios already have a creative team consisting of writers that work on scripts before going on the floors. Even smaller production houses such as Century Films International, producers of Amala Paul’s Adho Andha Paravai Pola, have taken to this idea.

Amala Paul’s next, Adho Andha Paravai Pola, is not just a full-length action flick shot in a jungle on a shoestring budget, but is also a project put together and executed by the film’s writer Arun Rajagopalan, who is also the film’s creative producer.

With the film releasing on February 14 after more than 2 years in production, Arun says that the unclear economics related to pitching a female-centric film back in 2016, negotiating the reluctance of established film-makers to work on scripts by other writers and helming a female-centric action flick worked in his favour.

“Back in 2016, OTT markets were at a very nascent stage and I didn’t even have a reference in Tamil about how one could make a movie headlined by a female star. We didn’t know how to work out the economics of the film. This meant that I had to take the ownership of the film right from the very beginning,” says Arun Rajagopalan.

He says that he worked closely with the film’s producer, Jones, and put together an entire team right from recruiting the actor, director and film’s cinematographer. Having earned the producer’s trust, Arun says that he also had to get involved in ensuring that the film’s production costs stayed within the planned budget by cutting unnecessary costs and getting the most out of the creative team.

The film’s trailer which was released recently is being noted for Amala Paul’s effort in pulling off the stunts sequences.

334,2020/01/27,"Keep choke hazards out of reach of children, Chennai doctors say","Last month, doctors at a children’s hospital in Chennai saw their youngest patient with food stuck in the airway -- a four-month-old baby, who was fed a peanut by a three-year-old sibling. Paediatricians say nuts are a complete no-no for children aged less than five years. Also, objects such as button batteries and beads should be kept out of reach of children due to the danger of choking that they present.

Every year, the Institute of Child Health (ICH) and Hospital for Children receives 40 to 50 children with ‘foreign bodies stuck in the airway’. The majority of them are in the age group of one to two years; a stage when children are starting to explore things. Though extremely rare, they have also received a few cases of babies aged 0 to 6 months.

“In the majority of cases, it is peanuts that get caught in the airway. ‘Sapota’ seeds and button batteries. The latter is very dangerous and can erode the insides. Parents should immediately suspect foreign body ingestion if the child has a sudden onset of cough and breathing difficulty,” said Rema Chandramohan, director of ICH.

At Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital (KKCTH), where S. Thirunavukkarasu, consultant - paediatric ENT and airway surgeon, used telescopic forceps to remove the peanut from the airway of the four-month-old baby, a total of 384 children have been treated over the last five years for aerodigestive tract (nose, throat, airway and foodpipe) foreign bodies.

“While peanuts are the most common in cases involving the airway, we are seeing a high number of children who have swallowed button batteries that are caught in the digestive tract, of late. This is because of access to gadgets and toys that have button batteries. When these batteries come in contact with saliva, they could start leaking an alkaline solution. This is dangerous and should be removed immediately,” he said.

S. Balasubramanian, medical director of KKCTH, said nuts, hard candies, fruits with seeds such as grapes, sapota, or dates should not be given to children below five years. “Keep button batteries, small plastic whistles and beads of jewellery out of reach of children. Preventing accidents in children is important, and parents should be sensitised during health check-ups and dietary visits,” he said.

A. K. Koushik, assistant professor, medical gastroenterology, Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre, said awareness on seeking appropriate medical care was crucial to prevent complications. “If a child swallows a foreign body at 10 p.m., where will parents take him or her? If they take the child to a centre that is not equipped to handle such cases, the child could end up in surgery due to mismanagement,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/keep-choke-hazards-out-of-reach-of-children-chennai-doctors-say/article30663725.ece
335,2020/01/27,Japanese technology-based sewage treatment plant launched in Chennai,"With growing awareness about sewage recycling in the city, a new technology was recently launched to cater to the domestic sector.

HECS Private Ltd., in collaboration with Daiki Axis Company, Japan recently launched ‘Johkasou’ , a Japanese technology-based packaged sewage treatment plant for the domestic, industrial and commercial sectors in the city, a press release said.

Several apartment complexes in the city’s fringes recycle waste water through their own sewage treatment plants (STP).

On the Japanese STP technology, J.R. Moses, chief executive officer, HECS private limited, said these plants are designed with a treatment capacity to handle 1 kilo litre a day to 50 kilo litre a day. “They are mass manufactured, whereby the cost of STPs are kept low while maintaining quality standard,” he said.

As the technology was soft launched in 2018, the plants are being operated in about 50 locations across South India. It was found that the maintenance cost was about 80% lower compared to other technologies.

Elaborating on the ‘Johkasou’ technology, Hiroshi Ogame, president, Daiki Axis, Japan, said the decentralised mode of sewage treatment helped in mitigating pollution in Japan’s water bodies. Some of its advantages include high levels of energy efficiency, complete automation and there was no need of dedicated operators. It does not produce a noise or smell.

There are plans to set up a manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu. A technical presentation of the Johkasou technology was also part of the event.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/n6mrot/article30663626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27JANTH-JapTechjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/japanese-technology-based-sewage-treatment-plant-launched-in-chennai/article30663628.ece
336,2020/01/27,Six arrested for attempt to hurl bombs at ‘Thughlak’ editor’s home in Chennai,"Six suspects have been apprehended by the Mylapore police for allegedly attempting to hurl bombs at the residence of Thughlak magazine editor, S. Gurumurthy, in Mylapore in the early hours of Sunday.

At 3.15 a.m., a group of unidentified persons arrived in motorcycles at Mr. Gurumurthy’s residence, located in Thyagarajapuram, Mylapore. Two of them alighted from the motorcycle and ran with a yellow cloth bag towards the gate. Alert police personnel guarding the premises chased them, and the duo abandoned their attempt and fled. Deputy Commissioner of Mylapore visited the spot.

After scrutinising of CCTV footage, Mylapore police apprehended six persons from a Periyarist outfit, suspecting their involvement. The alleged attempt is seen as a response to actor Rajinikanth’ s controversial speech about the 1971 Salem rally organised by Periyar, at a Thughlak magazine function recently.

A senior police said they were booked under section 436 (Mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause destroy a house) of the Indian Penal Code. Further interrogations are on.

337,2020/01/27,"NGT slams Kamarajar Port, North Chennai Thermal Power Station for polluting Ennore Creek","The Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has slammed the Kamarajar Port Ltd (KPL) and the North Chennai Thermal Power Station (NCTPS) for failing to clear the pollution caused by them in the Ennore Creek.

The Bench in particular came down heavily on the NCTPS, observing if State-owned industries themselves don’t comply with norms, it will send a wrong message to other industries.

The Bench also imposed an interim penalty of ₹8.34 crore on KPL as environmental compensation and ordered the port to deposit the amount with the Central Pollution Control Board within two months.

Based on a report submitted by a joint committee, the bench observed that “the violation still continues. Till the entire dump has been removed and damage caused to the environment is restored to its original position, M/s. Kamarajar Port Ltd., is liable to pay compensation”.

The Bench of Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta also directed the committee to look at measures to remediate the Creek and the cost required for it.

The Central Pollution Control Board which submitted its findings before the Tribunal found through satellite images, and site visits in late 2019 that the dredged material dumped in the nine dumping sites falling under CRZ notified area have not yet been fully removed.

“The mangroves in the area may be lost due to dumping in the nine sites. Currently, the mangroves in the area are very thin. The port authority has not adopted any scientific methods to remediate the soil or to restore the soil / mangroves to regional conditions. Though efforts were made to remove the dump falling with CRZ area, it is observed that it is not fully removed and dredged material is still lying in the CRZ area,” the report said.

The report also found high concentration levels of elements such as magnesium, aluminium, iron, potassium, chromium, lead and calcium in the soil in all the dumpsites used by KPL. The committee found that the high concentrations were found at a depth of 100 cm below the ground “indicating that the metals have leached from the dredged material dump sites”.

While the Committee pointed to improper handling of raw material, coal, iron ore, and other products by KPL and fly ash handling by NCTPS as primary reasons, it also held that the Ennore Creek is a recipient of domestic waste water from small scale industries, garages from Chennai city and marine outfall from industries are located in the Manali Industrial Estate near the port.

“Due to these reasons the soil near to the shore may be contaminated with chemical elements and heavy metals.""

With regard to the NCTPS, the Bench criticised the Committee for not making any attempt to consider the remediation measure to be undertaken and for relying only on the timeline provided by NCTPS to remove the fly ash.

Buckingham Canal

It was submitted before the Tribunal that the PWD had already commenced dredging of the Buckingham Canal and deposited the dredged ash and silt on the banks of the Canal. A timeline extending till 2022 was submitted to clear the Creek and the Canal of fly ash.

“As per the Fly Ash Disposal Notification 2017, the time line provided for 100% disposal is already over and no further extension has been given by the MoEF in this regard. So non-disposal of fly ash within the stipulated time will amount to serious violation,” the Bench said and slammed the CPCB for not even mentioning whether the direction issued by the Principal Bench over compensation has been complied with or not by the NCTPS.

The Bench held that the CPCB will have to fix the timeline for remediation than relying on the timeline provided by the NCTPS.

“If the State owned industries itself are not complying with the directions and if they are violating the norms under the hope that they will not be proceeded against and only directions will be issued to rectify the deficiencies then it will give a wrong message to other industries as well who may be tempted to violate the norms,” the Bench said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ngt-slams-kamarajar-port-north-chennai-thermal-power-station-for-polluting-ennore-creek/article30662591.ece

This is the first gram sabha meeting after representatives were elected in the recently held elections to the rural local bodies.

In Sirupuzhal Pettai village panchayat, a resolution was taken against board exams for class V and VIII students.

“It will be a burden on children. Hence we passed a resolution against it. Besides, we focussed on improving bus services and the need for adequate staff in the primary health centres,” said M. Ravikumar, union councillor.

In Pettykuppam village panchayat, a resolution was taken against the Amma Drinking Water plant. “Amma water supplied across the State is drawn from Pettykuppam. Groundwater, which was earlier available at 40 feet, has gone down to 240 feet. Due to this agriculture has been affected,” said P. Loganathan, a ward member.

At Light House Kuppam, president M. Gajendran led the villagers in passing a resolution seeking construction of gryones at the estuary to the Pulicat lake to keep it open throughout the year. “The lake needs urgent attention since it is getting silted up due to lack of enough tidal action,” he said.

340,2020/01/27,Toll plaza in Chengalpattu vandalised after altercation,"A toll plaza in Chengalpattu was vandalised after a fight erupted between staff of the toll plaza and crew of a government bus, during the early hours of Sunday. The police are yet to register an FIR in connection with the case.

According to the police, an SETC bus from Chennai was heading towards Tirunelveli. Around 1 a.m., it reached the Paranur toll plaza in Chengalpattu. The staff of the toll plaza asked the bus crew to pay toll charges, and conductor Pasumpon got down and went towards Muthu, who works at the plaza.

Support for conductor

“The two were arguing about payment, and suddenly it turned into an altercation. The toll staff assaulted Pasumpon. Seeing this, passengers got down from the bus and came in support of the conductor,” said a police officer.

Drivers and conductors of other buses that were near the plaza also came out in support. “Several crew members arrived at the spot, and the toll plaza was vandalised in the melee. No one was seriously injured in the incident,” said the officer.

The police are yet to register a case. “Counters in all lanes and boom barriers have been damaged. The plaza did not function on Sunday morning,” said the officer.

National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials said the bus had entered the extreme lane — the one for cash payment — at 1 a.m. When the booth operator requested for toll fee, a quarrel ensued. The bus driver parked the vehicle in such a manner that other vehicles could not cross the plaza, officials said.

Getting FASTag cards

Crew members of other buses and passengers in other vehicles were agitated and indulged in vandalism. The entire plaza, including the computers, ETC equipment and booths were damaged. “The quantum of loss is being ascertained. We have written to the State Transport Department, asking them to get radio frequency-enabled FASTag cards for making payments.

341,2020/01/27,"Forget burglars, this dog kept police at bay","In an unusual request, the T.N. Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) were called in on Sunday to assist in arresting a man accused under the POCSO Act as the latter’s aggressive pet dog kept the police team at bay.

According to police sources, the Villivakkam All Women Police Station (AWPS) received a complaint from a woman that her husband Balaraman had sexually harassed their second daughter. After investigation, Villivakkam AWPS inspector Uma Maheshwari went to arrest the offender around 4 a.m. on Sunday. “The suspect’s mother first said that he was not at home. However, the police found that he was on the first floor,” a senior police officer said. But when the police team tried to enter the house, Balaraman’s pet dog began barking and would not allow the police personnel to approach him.

Given the dog’s aggressive behaviour, the police called in the Villivakkam TNFRS personnel to remove the dog. A team lead by Villivakkam Station Fire Officer P. Mannar reached the spot quickly. “They went to a neighbouring house and using an equipment for rescuing dogs from wells, they caught the canine,” the officer said. The police team then went in and nabbed Balaraman. A case has been registered under the POCSO Act. “This is an example of excellent co-ordination we have with other departments.

342,2020/01/27,‘India needs a cohesive policy for e-vehicle push’,"Auto industry veteran V. Sumantran said the country needed a more cohesive policy than ‘Make in India’ in its push towards electrification of vehicles and to compete with China.

“In the push towards electric vehicles, most automakers are outsourcing critical systems like motors and battery packs. They will only manage their brand, interior and user experience. India will do well to keep that part of supply chain within the country,” he said.

Dr. Sumantran was speaking on the topic ‘Auto Industry- Present and Future Tense’, organised by The Triplicane Cultural Academy and The Kasturi Srinivasan Library, to mark the 66th anniversary of the academy.

“In terms of supply chain for electrification, China is a major threat. Once their market flattens, they will look at other attractive markets, and India is one of them,” said Dr. Sumantran, chairman of Celeris Technologies, and former vice-chairman of Ashok Leyland.

“In this regard, we need a more cohesive policy, which comprises an investment policy and trade pacts that let the value addition happen in India. If the domestic industry is encouraged and protected, the Chinese challenge can be overcome,” he said.

Dr. Sumantran said even if 30-40% of two-wheelers and buses in India have to migrate to electrification by 2025-26, it would require a battery capacity of 30-40 gigawatt-hour, with an investment of about ₹30,000-40,000 crore.

He said one of the encouraging signs was that two-wheeler makers Bajaj and TVS Motor recently launched electric two-wheelers, which were designed in India with indigenous components.

“If this trend is taken forward by Indian automakers, we will be in a good position. Startups like Ather are also doing well,” Dr. Sumantran said.

He also said that cars would take a longer time in India to shift to electrification.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/gto4b/article30660827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26SUMANTRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/india-needs-a-cohesive-policy-for-e-vehicle-push/article30660829.ece

345,2020/01/27,Whistling unites 50 Indians from across the globe,"On the 71st Republic Day, 50 members of the Indian Whistlers’ Association (IWA) whistled the song Mile Sur Mera Tumhara, from 18 cities in India, the U.S. and Malaysia, to send across a message of national integration and create awareness about the art of whistling.

The whistlers, transcending diversities in language, ethnicity and religion, came together and performed in the whistling tribute, ‘MSMT 2020’, released on social media on the eve of Republic Day. In the 6.11-minute video, some whistlers performed in front of different landmarks in their respective cities.

The video starts with Rigveda Deshpande, president, IWA, performing a solo portion in front of the Gateway of India. Following this, participants from places like Pune, Delhi, Chennai, Ernakulam, the U.S. and Malaysia whistle their parts alone, or in chorus.

Kush Bafna, an IWA member, is seen whistling the song, standing in front of the Ripon Buildings in Chennai, while another member, Vivek Venkatramani, is in front of the Schmidt Memorial at Elliot’s Beach.

“The video features whistlers from the age of 13 to those who are 71. The production took close to three months, and was meticulously planned,” said IWA founder-president Rigveda Deshpandey, who is also the director of the project.

Mr. Venkatramani said that the association was working towards achieving its dream of creating a Guinness World Record, with more than 1,000 people whistling together.

346,2020/01/27,Parking management system hit by glitches,"Glitches in the parking management system that was launched recently have led to civic issues in many localities.

For example, the photo of the number plate of a car parked in the parking slot does not match the data generated in the system.

The camera has started capturing number plates of cars parked in the area, but the system has not been able to decode them.

This has caused difficulty for officials involved in regulating parking in areas such as T. Nagar and Besant Nagar.

Unable to take action

The Command and Control Centre at the Ripon Buildings has not been able to use the facility to regulate parking in areas such as T. Nagar. Officials are unable to take action on violators due to the glitches.

If the system is used to penalise parking violators, officials will end up punishing innocent people.

So the system is being used manually. The automated parking management system is not yet automated, even after inauguration, said sources.

1.5 lakh parking slots

The parking management system is expected to help motorists book parking slots through a mobile app to ease traffic congestion.

The original proposal was to cover 12,500 parking slots in areas such as T. Nagar, Besant Nagar, Marina beach, Purasawalkam and Anna Nagar. Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash, at a press meet on Friday, said the city would get 1.5 lakh parking slots to ease traffic congestion on city roads.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/parking-management-system-hit-by-glitches/article30660716.ece
347,2020/01/27,‘Live remote monitoring’ to address civic issues to roll out soon,"The smart city project for addressing civic issues by systematic analysis of data collected by the Chennai Corporation and other civic agencies through ‘live remote monitoring’ is set to roll out shortly.

There have been demands that the Corporation must ensure that local residents in each area have a greater role in deciding locations for installation of ‘live remote monitoring facilities’, including facial recognition cameras and vehicle number plate recognition cameras.

The Corporation and other civic agencies will install at least 20,000 cameras with facilities for facial recognition and vehicle number plate recognition this year. The cameras will also automatically detect potholes, identify encroachments, check parking violations, monitor accidents and track crime.

Former Chennai Corporation floor leader V. Sukumar Babu said the officials were selecting locations for installation of cameras without consulting locals.

“If the officials intend to analyse civic issues, they should first talk to the people. They conducted a workshop 18 months ago on smart city mission. No public consultation has been conducted so far. Residents should know about the significance of selecting a particular location for camera surveillance,” he said.

Public consultation

Mugalivakkam resident S. Kannan said the Corporation should conduct public consultation with residents’ associations to finalise locations of the cameras for reducing the dumping of waste in residential areas.

The Corporation has identified 6,000 spots where dumping of garbage happens in the city. Over 400 locations are categorised as “chronic” in terms of dumping of garbage, affecting public health. “We plan to erect smart poles in such locations with cameras that can do facial recognition. We are erecting 100 poles for such cameras to monitor street littering,” said an official.

S. Mangala Raj, former councillor, said the system might detect open defecation near garbage bins, causing embarrassment to the Corporation, which has wrongly claimed that the city is ‘open defecation-free’. “They should construct better toilets in every locality before installing facial recognition cameras for surveillance. They should ensure dignity of each individual,” he said.

Corporation officials said ‘video analytics’, which involves the systematic analysis of real-time data collected by the camera through the ₹150-crore Command and Control Centre at the Ripon Buildings, would send alerts to officials concerned for immediate action.

The system would also send alerts on rash driving, vandalism, gesture-based SOS recognition, accident, chain snatching, eve-teasing, stalking, abduction, and child labour.

In the first phase, the camera-based video analytics will be commissioned at major transit points, railway junctions, airport, bus terminus, places of worship, cinema halls, schools, bus route roads, colleges, universities, Metro stations, government offices and slums.

Parking violations

Chennai Smart City is installing 668 cameras, which will capture parking violations and encroachments.

The police are expected to install 10,000 cameras, which will be integrated with the Command and Control Centre at the Ripon Buildings. The Nirbhaya Fund will be used to install 7,000 cameras and Smart City funds will be used to install 2,000 cameras, officials said. “All these cameras will have facial recognition by August,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sufugq/article30660708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THSMART,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/live-remote-monitoring-to-address-civic-issues-to-roll-out-soon/article30660709.ece

Police said, a shopkeeper in Ritchie Street on January 24 pasted a poster inside his shop supporting CAA. On seeing this, some persons questioned him and subsequently an argument ensued. The shopkeeper lodged a complaint with the station and based on it, the six persons were detained, police sources said. They were then let off the same day.

In the morning of January 26, some miscreants threw eggs at the shop, and the shopkeeper filed a fresh complaint.

Police said they detained the same six persons based on evidence. Out of the six, three are being inquired, the police added.

While there were rumours that the protest on January 26 night was anti-CAA, police said it was not true.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wj7zb/article30660542.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-01-26-at-111508-PM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hundreds-protest-outside-chintadripet-police-station-in-chennai/article30660543.ece
349,2020/01/27,Coronavirus outbreak,"The outbreak of coronavirus in China is giving serious cause for concern, if not trepidation. China’s National Health Commission has confirmed at least 56 deaths and around 2,000 cases of coronavirus infection since the contagious and deadly disease emerged sometime in December 2019. The WHO has not yet declared it a global health emergency. Still, it is feared that it may become a pandemic disease despite the slew of measures taken to stop its spread.

The new viral threat has put millions of people on lockdown and cast a shadow on the Lunar New Year events. It not only hurts the economy, but has also exacted $145 million for containment. The empty shops and markets, the imposition of travel restrictions, the cancellation of flights and trains in and around the virus-stricken regions, the closure of some sections of the Great Wall of China and Disney resorts to visitors, the ban on trade in wild animals, and the construction of two new hospitals in the worst-affected Wuhan on a war footing bespeak the scale, severity and seriousness of the problem.

Named “2019- Novel Coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”, the pathogen appears to have originated in a fish and animal market in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province. Experts have confirmed animal-to-human and human-to-human transmission of the new strain. Symptoms include dry cough, fever, fatigue, muscle aches and acute breathing difficulty. The incubation period for the virus can last from 10 to 14 days. The infection can cause pneumonia, respiratory distress, kidney failure and in some cases, in which immunity is weak, even death.

As of now, there is no vaccine against coronavirus infection. There is also no cure for the 2019-nCoV. Nevertheless, the virus’s genetic code has been sequenced by Chinese scientists incredibly quickly, giving rise to the hope that a vaccine and a drug could be developed soon. Now there is only ‘supportive care’ to people infected with coronavirus. Recommended measures to reduce the risk of transmission include wearing face-masks and protective suits, washing hands and avoidance of contacts with infected persons and animals. There is no room for complacency; China and the rest of the world must be on full alert and take all possible measures to combat the new, never-before encountered pestilence.

351,2020/01/27,Women of science,"I refer to “Why are there more men than women in the STEM field” (Science page, Jan. 26). The history of science is a history of the women’s contributions being overlooked. Nobel Prizes in general have a gender problem. Superlatives like “brilliant” and “genius” are used more for men. Marie Curie did break the glass ceiling by winning two Nobel Prizes, but that did not lead to greater recognition for other women scientists. Rosalind Franklin’s X-ray crystallography data led to the discovery of the Double Helix but Francis Crick and James Watson won the Nobel. Lise Meitner, along with Otto Hahn and Otto Robert Frisch, was behind the discovery of nuclear fission of uranium and was nominated for the Nobel many times but it was Hahn who got the award. In the field of medicine, a review by the Harvard Business Review found that though women constituted 34% of U.S. physicians, only 18% were hospital CEOs were women.

352,2020/01/27,MPs with criminal cases,"It may be a bit too much to expect our Parliament to enact a “strong law” to prevent politicians facing trial for serious crimes from contesting elections, with 43% of parliamentarians facing criminal cases and 29% facing serious criminal cases (Front page, “Aspirants with criminal past should not get ticket, EC tells SC,” Jan. 25). Instead, the Supreme Court by itself should take up the task of laying down guidelines. There have been several precedents. For instance, the apex court’s verdict in Vishaka v. State of Rajasthan (1997), in the absence of legislation, provided an overarching framework in dealing with cases of sexual harassment at workplace.

Kosaraju Chandramouli,

While the helplessness of the Election Commission in failing to stop criminalisation of politics is understandable, its proposition to the apex court to ask political parties not to give tickets to those with criminal antecedents is rather surprising. Undoubtedly, the court’s request to the petitioners themselves to come up with a ‘joint proposal’ is welcome. However, one fails to understand how and whether such proposals can ever be implemented without a statute, enacting which is Parliament’s prerogative. There are several stinging judgments that have been treated with scant respect by all political parties. It will require great magnanimity on the part of our parties to cleanse themselves.

353,2020/01/27,Fear-mongering on CAA,"All political parties, be it Congress or Left, must look at the larger national perspective (“Fear-mongering on CAA is a threat”, Jan. 25). The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was passed by a majority of elected representatives in Parliament and the Supreme Court is now seized of the matter regarding the constitutionality of the impugned law. The Prime Minister has also promised that it will not impact on Indian citizens. The CAA will grant fast-track citizenship to Hindus and other small groups of immigrants who faced persecution in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on grounds of religion. The fear-mongering concerning the CAA is unfair and motivated.

Kangayam R. Narasimhan,

Chennai

It is disappointing that Rajasthan and Telangana have joined the list of States that have opposed the CAA. When it comes to matters of national importance, political parties must avoid projecting their own personal decisions. Vote bank strategies should not influence a State’s decision. The reason for implementation of the CAA is to ensure that people with dubious identity are weeded out for our own safety. Farsightedness is essential in such matters. One can understand individuals protesting but not States as a whole. These opposing States may become safe havens for those who have hidden agendas and this will only nullify the whole exercise. The reason for their opposition to the CAA is not any policy decision but the fear that the BJP’s stocks will soar higher. By the time these States realise their mistakes, it may be a bit too late. It is unfortunate that in this time of crisis, there is no neutral and respected statesman who can be informative in order to bring uniformity.

Observing it, one question I repeatedly ask myself is: What message does such grandeur send out? My problem is not with celebrating nationhood, but the manner in which we do it. Such naked show of ‘military might’ may look flattering, but how does it benefit us as a nation? Yes, we are all proud Indians, but can we not commemorate the occasion by actually contributing towards nation building in some way, instead of doing and watching ceremonious parades that meaninglessly exhibit combat capabilities on the streets? Maybe, we can spend the day doing something as simple as planting trees or cleaning our locality or even distributing books free of cost to those unable to afford basic education?

356,2020/01/27,The enemies of writing,"How do journalists report pain, loss and grief without exhibiting voyeuristic tendencies? If these are policy-induced tragedies, how can they write about the inhuman elements of the policy and the havoc such a policy wrecks on people’s lives? Journalists who report on issues that have a profound impact on people’s lives recognise that the unfolding tragedies often go beyond the conventional understanding of the tragedy of the commons. A short news report, which is either a cryptic statement about the unimaginative policy or one that provides data on loss, does not have the potential to understand pain. Long-form reportage captures the ‘tragedy of the commons’.

New fears among repatriates

A Ground Zero report, “Fifty years on, new fears for repatriates” (The Hindu, January 25, 2020), is an example of effective long-form journalism. This report captures the fear among repatriates from Sri Lanka, who settled in the Nilgiris many decades ago. They are victims of policies adopted by the Governments of Sri Lanka and India. The report documents not only the uncertain migratory journey from the hills of central Sri Lanka to the plantation regions of Tamil Nadu, but also the arbitrariness with which the state apparatus decided who can opt for which citizenship. A recurring subject during my reporting days was the statelessness in Sri Lanka among the ‘up-country Tamils’, an euphemism for describing a huge section of the population who were brought as indentured labour to plant extensive cash crops in Sri Lanka.

As the National Register of Citizens is being widely discussed in various fora, it is important to know what it means to be rendered stateless. The plight of the up-country Tamils in Sri Lanka reminds us that policies cannot be made on the basis of the whims of leaders. They require wide consultations. In October 1964, Prime Ministers Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Lal Bahadur Shastri signed an accord which arbitrarily determined the future of nearly a million people who were rendered stateless by legislation in 1948 and 1949. The Sirimavo-Shastri Pact divided the stateless people on a ratio of seven is to four between India and Sri Lanka, respectively. Of the 9.75 lakh stateless persons, 5.25 lakh were to be repatriated to India, while 3 lakh were to be granted Sri Lankan citizenship. The fate of another 1.5 lakh people was kept in abeyance. In 1974, Prime Ministers Bandaranaike and Indira Gandhi signed another accord, which divided these people equally — 75,000 each between the two countries. And these agreements were signed without taking into account the views of the people concerned.

I remember how the founder of the Ceylon Workers’ Congress, Saumiyamoorthy Thondaman, tried to address the multiple issues that flowed from the ignominy of being stateless and finally persuaded the Sri Lankan government to grant citizenship to people who remained in Sri Lanka. One of the issues I had to confront at that time was dealing with policymakers who failed to distinguish between the repatriates, who were in India because of an agreement between the two nation states, and the Sri Lankan Tamils, who had come as refugees fleeing violence. It remains a poignant reminder that whenever Union governments come up with a systemically flawed policy, it is the State governments that have to pay a higher price.

Journalism, an early warning system

George Packer, 2019 winner of the Hitchens Prize, titled his acceptance speech, “The enemies of writing”. In that piece, he says a writer who’s afraid to tell people what they don’t want to hear has chosen the wrong trade. Journalism is not about reporting what people want to hear. It is about being an early warning system, a wake-up call, and a recorder of the lives of the people. Mr. Packer makes a distinction between politicians, and activists and writers, which includes journalists. He argues that the former are representatives, while writers “are individuals whose job is to find language that can cross the unfathomable gap separating us from one another”. He asked writers and journalists to consciously shun the thought police because a writer who carries the thought police in his head ends up producing words that soon become lifeless.

Long-form reportage gives journalists space to both confront the enemies of writing and expose policy-induced tragedies, which are on the rise.

359,2020/01/27,An innovation that ended as a failure,"We often busy ourselves with scientific stories and the success they inspire. So much so that we sometimes even make the mistake of assuming that all such innovations turn out to be winners. But by simply looking around ourselves, and by learning from our own personal experiences, we do know that this can surely not be the case all the time. The story of Corfam, a synthetic substitute for leather first unveiled to the public in 1964, refers to one such incident.

Be it shoes, handbags or wallets, leather continues to be a popular material to work with, even now. It was the case over a hundred years ago as well, and it also implied that the stage was set for synthetic substitutes to compete with it.

DuPont enters the scene

The search for a synthetic replacement for leather began early in the 20th Century. The chemicals company DuPont, which would go on to have tremendous success with another synthetic material nylon from the 1930s, entered the business as early as 1910. They did this by buying the Fabrikoid Company that specialised in producing nitrocellulose-coated cotton fabric. This fabric was mainly employed in binding books and in the automotive industry, but could be made into other objects as well.

It was only in the 1950s that DuPont scientists finally succeeded in creating a material that not only looked like leather, but also had a highly shiny gloss surface. The substance was poromeric, meaning it was made by bonding a plastic-like coating on a fibrous base substrate. The term “poromeric” was coined by DuPont, deriving from the words “porous” and “polymeric”.

Its shiny appearance along with its high cost of production led DuPont to market the material mainly as footwear, especially as dress shoes. With employees agreeing to wear such shoes for a certain amount of time and provide feedback, DuPont had over 15,000 wear-tested shoes by 1962.

One step forward, many steps backward

The material, branded as Corfam, was brought to the shoe industry in the 1963 Chicago Shoe Show. Even though primarily targeting the footwear market, other items, including handbags, were made of Corfam and tested. On January 27, 1964, the public was made aware of Corfam’s existence.

DuPont believed that they had a winner in their hands. They were so overconfident that they predicted that by the 1980s, a quarter of the footwear market would be using Corfam. Production and sales did start off as per their outlook, with nearly 7.5 million Corfam shoes made and sold by 1969.

By then, however, problems started cropping up. Shoes made of Corfam didn’t breathe like those made of real leather, resulting in users complaining about hot feet. Corfam didn’t stretch like real leather either, which meant that users had to get an exact fit while buying.

These reasons, along with the increasing popularity of vinyl shoes, meant that consumers started moving away from this product. Sales plummeted so much that DuPont ended the project in 1971, merely seven years after starting production and trumpeting their success.

A business lesson

Even though poromeric shoes continue to exist, especially in military circles, Corfam was doomed. It is for this reason that Corfam, despite being a scientific success, is more often referred to in business lessons. For a new product vying for a share in an existing market should not just be happy to match with the competition, but should probably outdo it in more ways than one.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/ri85ti/article30650753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27isbsbrownjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/an-innovation-that-ended-as-a-failure/article30650754.ece

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Narayanasamy said himself, Speaker V.P. Sivakolundhu, Member of Parliament V. Vaithilingam and a few Ministers attended the event, the customary reception hosted by the Lieutenant Governor on the Republic Day evening, as invitees to wish the gathering.

The Chief Minister said that without giving information, the Lt. Governor’s Office decided to felicitate Padma award-winners and give awards to officials.

‘No information’

“We did not have any information on the felicitation part. The Lt. Governor cannot take unilateral decision on selecting officials for awards,” he said.

The Lt. Governor’s decision to honour two officials for attending to “maximum” number of grievances was itself a flawed policy. The proper procedure to attend public grievances was through the Ministry. A grievance received by the Lt. Governor’s office had to be forwarded to the Secretary for follow up in consultation with the Minister concerned, the Chief Minister said.

364,2020/01/27,Puducherry Assembly Committee on Privileges summons Chief Secretary,"The Assembly Committee on Privileges on Monday summoned Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar as part of the proceedings against him for floating an advertisement to appoint a State Election Commissioner in violation of a ruling given by Speaker V. P Sivakolundhu.

The Committee, headed by Deputy Speaker M.N.R Balan, inquired with the Chief Secretary about the circumstances leading to the floating of the advertisement despite an Assembly resolution giving powers to the elected government to appoint the SEC. Further proceedings would be initiated after internal deliberations, a government source told The Hindu.

Mr. Kumar is the second Chief Secretary in the Union Territory to be summoned by the Privileges Committee. In 2009, the Committee had initiated proceedings against then Chief Secretary Rakesh Behari for making certain disrespectful remarks against Ministers and legislators during an internal official meeting. The proceedings were stopped in between as Behari moved out of the UT, the source added..

The Committee began proceedings on the SEC appointment issue earlier this month after Congress legislator T. Djeamourthy complained about breach of privilege by officials in the appointment of the poll officer.

The government had appointed former bureaucrat T. M Balakrishnan, last year, as SEC after Speaker V. P Sivakolundhu gave a ruling bestowing power to appoint the election officer with the elected government.

365,2020/01/27,Delay in setting up cashew cluster affects industry in Panruti,"A want of innovation and a delay in setting up a cluster for cashews aimed at boosting production, revenue and broad-basing opportunities, have adversely impacted the cashew industry in Panruti, Tamil Nadu’s cashew hub. ​

​The scenario has compelled several cashew processing units in the region to cut down on their production over the years. The industry in Panruti may soon face a threat like of that in Kerala, if the government fails to come to its rescue, say exporters. ​

​Panruti has identified itself with production of cashews, but the farmers are adopting virtually outdated, traditional and unscientific methods of cultivation. Consequently, the investment has been on the high side while output has reduced. ​Out of the total 1,42,000 hectares under cashew cultivation in Tamil Nadu, Panruti accounts for about 35,000 hectares. There are around 32 export-oriented cashew production units in Panruti besides 250 processing units and more than 500 cottage industries. ​

“Although at the national level, the yield of cashew nuts is 756 kg per hectare, Panruti and Tamil Nadu as a whole shows production levels of 478 kg per hectares. This is very bad from the point of view of the sustenance of farmers,” says M. Ramakrishnan, secretary of Tamil Nadu Cashew Exporters and Processors Association. ​

Farmers are also keeping their fingers crossed because of a lack of patronage from the government to increase the area under cultivation and quantity of processing. ​The old system of cultivation, lack of subsidies for purchase of machinery, hesitation on the part of farmers to switch over to cultivate hybrid varieties and adopt mechanisation, have been contributing to poor value realisation of produce. Most of the crops in Panruti are over 50 years old resulting in low yield, Mr. Ramakrishnan added. ​

​For many years now, farmers in Panruti have been demanding a cluster for cashews and also for cold storage to keep the occupation going. While States like Kerala and Goa have been marching ahead, Tamil Nadu and more particularly Panruti has been lagging behind due to want of innovation. ​

​“Thousands of farmers in the region are cultivating cashews on a large scale and they are supplying the raw nuts to the market. While the demand is on the rise, value realisation of our products is very meagre. The establishment of a cluster would not only benefit farmers but also those involved in the production, processing and marketing of cashews in the region,” says Gowthaman, a farmer of Panruti. ​

​According to N. Malarvasagam, Managing Director of Srinivasa Cashews, “The industry also lacks a full-fledged warehousing facility and drying yard for nuts. The cashew nut Agricultural Export Zone (AEZ) in Kadampuliyur near Panruti does not suit the needs of the industry here and is now virtually under the control of a monopoly. The AEZ, a joint venture between the Government and a private player has now been leased and most of the export units have been using their own packaging and grading facilities.” ​",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/7lbk8z/article30664591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27JANTH-CASHEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/delay-in-setting-up-cashew-cluster-affects-industry-in-panruti/article30664592.ece
366,2020/01/27,Fear of closure leaves AFT workers in the lurch,"Amid the ongoing tussle between Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi and Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on closure of the century-old Anglo French Textiles (AFT) mills, the future of 675 workers in the mill is at stake.

The Industries Department’s decision to close down the mill under Section 25-O of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, has sparked resentment among trade unions, triggering panic among the workers.

The move has triggered a war of words between the Lt. Governor and the Chief Minister. While Ms. Bedi says an expert committee had recommended closure of the mill, Mr. Narayanasamy hit back stating that the recommendation of the government for introduction of voluntary retirement scheme had been rejected by the Lt. Governor who insisted on closing down the unit. He said the Cabinet headed by him had taken a decision that the mill should never be closed.

The management has not offered any clarity on the future operations in the mill. There is a sense of fear among workers and employees that the mill will not be reopened once it is closed.

One of the few surviving industrial vestiges from the colonial era, the Anglo-French Textiles, once known as Rodier Mill, was established in 1898 by a firm with its headquarters in London.

Pride of Puducherry

In 1899, the mill was even provided with a railway branch line connecting the Puducherry-Villupuram railway mainline to facilitate freight movement and went on to become a major exporter of cotton fabrics to the U.S., the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Australia and Belgium.

The mill was a major source of revenue to both the Union and Puducherry governments after the specially floated Pondicherry Textile Corporation (PTC) took over the administration of the mill in 1984. The mill was the main source of supply of material to the Indian Air Force and Navy for its requirement of parachutes.

“The Congress fought the election in 1985 only by projecting the AFT mill issue and because of the promise given by the then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the mill was taken over by the territorial government and gave a guarantee of livelihood to workers. The administration by an IAS officer P.M. Nair as managing director gave a new life to the mill.

“In fact products made in the mill were much sought after by tourists. But over the years the mill was not managed properly leading to the present situation. On no account, the mill should be closed,” said S. Nadarajan, a senior citizen.

“To be an employee or a worker in the AFT was a prestige for the workers. The mill is a landmark in the industrial growth of Puducherry but over the years constant intervention by political parties crippled the smooth working of the undertaking,” said an official on condition of anonymity.

AITUC general secretary V.S. Abishegam blamed the ruling Congress and the AINRC for the present mess. The government should have taken steps to prevent the trend of loss in the initial stage itself but when the situation became worse, the intervention of administration led to the slow decline in the production, he charged.

The Industries Department had issued a similar order for closure of the mill in 2010 but the AITUC resorted to a legal recourse and the Madras High Court ordered that status quo be maintained, he pointed out.

While operations in the mill continued, the previous AINRC regime announced a VRS package and announced lay off in November 2013, which had been continuing till date. The mill, which once had a strength of over 6,600 workers, now had a meagre strength of 675, he said.

Mr. Abishegam said until the financial year 1993-94, the AFT, Swadeshi and Bharathi Mills fetched ₹250 crore revenue to the Union government through exports. But the Union government had not done anything to renovate these mills, he alleged.

Mr. Narayanasamy and AINRC founder N. Rangasamy had failed to follow up on their plea to the Centre to earmark ₹500 crore to revive the mill, he said.

Workers were now caught in the crossfire between Lieutenant Governor and the Chief Minister. The mill workers were living in abject poverty with wages not paid to service workers and dues to retired personnel not settled.

CPI(M) secretary R. Rajangam said that there was still room for rehabilitation of the mill either by appointing experts or by resorting to effective strategy to ensure its functioning as before.

The AFT, along with Swadeshi and Bharathi mills, were a major source of revenue and employment. The government could adopt a pragmatic approach and all the mills could be integrated and brought under one roof to facilitate large scale production, he suggested.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/kf025f/article30662845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THAFTMILL02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/fear-of-closure-leaves-aft-workers-in-the-lurch/article30662846.ece

368,2020/01/27,Rural agri policy soon to encourage tourism sector: Bedi,"A rural and agri tourism policy will be published shortly to encourage rural and agriculture tourism and build on the momentum in the tourism sector, Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi said on Sunday.

In her message at the 71st Republic Day celebrations at the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex, Uppalam, the Lt. Governor noted that the tourism sector was gaining momentum in the Union Territory with tourist arrivals clocking a significant growth of 8% over the previous year.

Pointing out that the Puducherry government has initiated various projects with Central assistance to strengthen tourism sector in the Union Territory, Ms. Bedi said the administration proposed to operate various theme-based tours such as e-bike tour, heritage tour, spiritual tour, eco tour and adventure tour.

Ms. Bedi also highlighted the Union Territory’s achievements in health, implementation of national programmes, the Ayushman Bharat programme for upgrading public health centres and sub-centres and tie-ups with multi-specialty hospitals to extend specialised services for the poor.

Pointing to agriculture as a focus area which provided sustenance to 50% of the Union Territory’s population, the Lt. Governor said various schemes had been implemented for betterment of farmers’ welfare such as mechanisation, water management and groundwater conservation.

Under the crop insurance scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana had enrolled 4,997 farmers in Puducherry, 4,803 farmers in Karaikal and 473 ryots in Yanam.

It is proposed to implement Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana in Puducherry to encourage organic farming, the Lt. Governor said.

A new scheme of financial assistance to farmer producer companies will also be implemented to provide subsidy to farmer producers organisations to supply paddy and vegetable seeds.

Ms. Bedi also highlighted the various initiatives taken in the fisheries and animal husbandry sectors.

Quality education

The Government prioritised providing quality education at affordable cost and had launched various initiatives such as free uniforms, learning resources, breakfast scheme and Re. 1 transport to check school drop-outs.

A slew of pre-matric and post-matric scholarships were also sanctioned to OBC and minority communities. On the higher education front, Ms. Bedi said NEET coaching would be revamped so that more Government school students will be able to crack the entrance test.

Towards providing the right stimulus for industrial growth by encouraging MSMEs, the government had opened a portal for ease of doing business and a capital investment subsidy has been released to 32 units under ‘Motivation of Entrepreneurs to Start Industries and Fiscal Assistance to Industries’ initiative.

Schemes to uplift and improve socio-economic status of marginalised sections, targeting 2,000 woman farmers under the Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana, social security cushion to unorganised labour and skill development youth in coastal areas were also flagged in the Lt. Governor’s message.

On Puducherry being adjudged the best among Union Territories in good governance by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances, the Lt. Governor complimented the Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, elected representatives and official machinery for the achievement.

Welfare schemes

Noting the commendable law and order situation due to efficient policing, the Lt. Governor said the government would carry forward people-friendly policies, programmes and schemes for prosperity and welfare of the people.

“The Government shall continue its endeavour to maintain the sizeable allocation for various welfare oriented and developmental programmes,” Ms. Bedi said.

Action will also be taken to fill up vacant posts in government departments through promotion and direct recruitment.

Pointing out that the Constitution envisaged fundamental rights and democratic values based on principles of justice and equality, the Lt. Governor called for pledging to uphold the ideals enshrined in the Constitution and to work towards the vision of the founding fathers.

Earlier, the Lieutenant Governor unfurled the national flag and inspected a guard of honour by the territorial police.

373,2020/01/27,"Serie A: Napoli stun Juventus on Sarri's return, Ronaldo scores again","Serie A leaders Juventus suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Napoli on Sunday, with coach Maurizio Sarri returning to his former club for the first time, though Cristiano Ronaldo still managed to score for an eighth league game in a row for the visitors.

Juve, who are chasing a ninth successive title and could have gone six points clear with a win, instead remained on 51 and saw their lead cut to three points by Inter Milan, who drew 1-1 at home to Cagliari earlier on Sunday.

Midfielder Piotr Zielinski, who Sarri brought to Napoli during his three-year stint at the club, broke the deadlock in the 63rd minute and captain Lorenzo Insigne hooked in the home side's second goal with four minutes left.

Out-of-sorts Juve took more than an hour to manage a shot on target although Ronaldo pulled one back in the 90th minute as he continued his scoring run.

“We were passive for the whole game,” said Sarri. “It was a bland performance, we were caught between pressing and waiting. They only had to do the bare minimum to beat us.”

The Juve coach, who led Napoli to second place with a club record points tally in his final season in charge in 2017-18, was jeered by the crowd and insulting banners were placed in various parts of the city before the match.

Napoli, who are 10th on 27 points and having one of their worst seasons for years, had lost their first three home league games since Gennaro Gattuso replaced Carlo Ancelotti as coach in January.

Gattuso, who only a week ago slammed an “embarrassing” home display in a 2-0 defeat by Fiorentina, was much happier.

“We have to keep going like this now, not let up and focus on Napoli 24 hours a day,” he said. “I havent been here long, but this team have hurt themselves with certain attitudes and behaviour.

“We have been jeered and insulted, often quite rightly, so its up to us now to turn things around.”

Attacking lineup

Sarri fielded an adventurous lineup with Gonzalo Higuain and Paulo Dybala alongside Ronaldo but they were stifled by Napoli's tireless running.

Ronaldo had a goal disallowed after halftime for offside against Higuain in the build-up but Juve finally managed a shot on goal in the 62nd minute when Higuain's effort was comfortably saved by Alex Meret.

A minute later, Napoli went ahead. Juve keeper Wojciech Szczesny could only parry a fierce, dipping shot from Insigne and the ball fell to Zielinski who rifled it into the top corner.

Insigne volleyed the second from Jose Callejon's cross before Ronaldo netted a consolation, getting between two defenders to turn Rodrigo Bentancur's long ball into the net.

Juve nearly levelled in a tense finale but Higuain's overhead kick was saved by Meret.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/rtrqod/article30662721.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKSOCCER-ITALY-NAP-JUVREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/serie-a-napoli-stun-juventus-on-sarris-return-ronaldo-scores-again/article30662722.ece

“When I started playing football, I had no clue about these awards.

“All I can recall is when I first saw a women’s football match, I wanted to represent my country,” she said.

“I worked hard for it and as I played for the senior team, I realised that winning medals is very tough in football.

“I played for over 20 years for India, so when the government acknowledged my contribution with the Arjuna award, I felt satisfied,” said Bembem.

377,2020/01/27,Valve replaced without opening heart in 80-year-old woman,"A team of doctors at the Heart and Brain Institute replaced a defective heart valve of an 80-year-old woman without performing the traditional open heart surgery, giving her a new lease of life. Surgery was delayed for the patient of an advanced age because of the high risk of open heart surgery.

Team leader and interventional cardiologist J. Srimannarayana told The Hindu that the patient was brought to the hospital with cardiac failure, to be more specific, heart failing to pump enough blood (cardiogenic shock) despite beating too fast (tachycardia). After emergency resuscitation she was put on ventilator support. Investigations showed that her Aorta (main artery that carries blood from heart to the rest of the body) highly calcified and had become very narrow (aortic stenosis).

When she was admitted to a hospital five years ago an open heart surgery was not suggested because of age related risk and she was put on conservative management. But now she was hospitalised in a worse condition.

Traditional therapy

The traditional therapy for severe aortic stenosis was Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement (SAVR). For this, cardio thoracic surgeons would open the chest, put the patient on a heart-lung machine, remove the defective valve and replace it with a new artificial valve.

“SAVR was not a thrilling option for this patient. So Heart and Brain team of doctors opted for the Non-Invasive Trans Catheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR),” Dr. Srimannarayana explained.

After the procedure, the patient has been weaned off the ventilator. The patient was in a stable condition, ready to be discharged, he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/valve-replaced-without-opening-heart-in-80-year-old-woman/article30662731.ece

According to the sources, the animal keeper allowed the male elephant to walk unchained, a regular practice followed in the zoo park. However, the pachyderm got panicked and moved helter and skelter inside the enclosure. The zoo officials had to divert the elephant by giving sugar canes and got it chained again. Sources said the elephant hit the animal keeper, but Zoo Curator Yesoda Bai denied it.

“On Sunday, the elephant was taken for a walk. However, it did not respond to the commands of the animal keeper. May be it wanted to walk on a different path. To give the animal some space, we blocked the area for some time.

384,2020/01/27,DCIL all set to sell away its building in Vizag,"The building constructed by the Dredging Corporation of India Limited (DCIL) in the Seethammadhara Housing Board Colony to run its corporate office has been put up for sale.

The DCIL, in which a consortium of four major ports led by Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) has acquired 73.47% equity last year by paying little over ₹1,000 crore, has entrusted the job of finding a buyer through online sale to Metal Scrap Trading Corporation (MSTC), according to its Chairman Rinkesh Roy.

Mr. Roy, the Chairman of Paradip Port Trust, told The Hindu on phone that they were expecting a good response to sell away the five plus two basement building constructed with green technology.

‘Upset price fixed at ₹78 cr.’

An official of MSTC said the upset price had been fixed at ₹78 crore. MSTC is scheduled to open the bids on January 30. Sources said that the DCIL, which had spent about ₹45 crore on the building, expects to generate ₹100 crore or above by selling away the property.

A consortium consisting of Visakhapatnam Port Trust, Paradip Port Trust, Jawahalal Nehru Port Trust and Deendayal (Kandla) Port Trust took the strategic control of the Visakhapatnam-headquartered public sector unit after the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs permitted them to takeover of 73.47% equity of the Government of India.

The site measuring 5329 square yards has now a modern building with adequate space for parking and open area with all clearances. In view of the State government’s plan to set up the Executive capital in Visakhapatnam, the ready-to-occupy structure may have a good demand.

Earlier, the government had explored the strategic sale of the DCIL, triggering off widespread protests over the move which was described by the opponents as an attempt to hand over the profit-making company to private hands.

By virtue of holding a majority stake of 19.47%, the VPT has the highest stake in the company.

388,2020/01/27,District library finally gets a place of its own,"Nearly 10 years after being shifted from its own building, the District Central Library languishes in a congested building amid commercial businesses and cacophony. The library was functioning out of two-storied building of the Zilla Grandhalaya Samstha (ZGS) in its one acre land at Maharanipeta till a decade ago.

Though a sustained struggle involving various sections of people and intelligentsia, the Poura Grandhalayala Seva Samithi (PGSS) managed to realise the objective of restoring the land to the samstha.

Getting its own building constructed after taking possession of its own land may again take a long time. Until then, the wait by readers in general and youth and students in particular gets prolonged.

Persisting with its efforts, PGPS and the samithi have been able to get ‘no encumbrance’ certificate for the site from the Stamps and Registration Department by registering a Deed of Termination of Lease Agreement.

After a visit by Municipal Commissioner G. Srijana, who is the person in charge of ZGS, a board was erected ‘This land belongs to ZGS’. Nearly after a decade, the ZGS has been able to assert its right over the land.

Land status

Meanwhile, a CRPF Battalion has been making use of the ZGS site for parking its vehicles. President of PGSS B.L. Narayana, who has relentlessly pursued the issue with the support other concerned individuals and people’s representatives, says: ""With the site now restored, a building has to be constructed there. For that, the CRPF Battalion has to be given an alternative site. To avoid hardships to readers and make it more conducive for reading, it has to be shifted to spacious and better premises. In that direction, efforts have begun to locate it at VMRDA Building in Pithapuram Colony.""

But how long it will take to get a building again is the moot question.

Infructuous saga

The infructuous saga of the ZGS site lease finally ending up without the building constructed had begun with the Director of Public Libraries entering into an agreement with Prathyusha Resources and Infra Private Limited, allegedly backed by an influential politician, for construction of integrated commercial and institutional development project in seven floors in February, 2010.

As per the lease-cum-development agreement on Build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis with the ZGS getting a total of 27,000 sft exclusively in the ground and first floors. Though the construction had to be completed in two years, it never actually began though the old building was demolished.

The Left parties launched protests. PGPS spearheaded an agitation, including signature campaign and public ballot, opposing the lease of ZGS land, raising the issue of ‘conflict of interest’ also.

Former Vice-Chancellor K.V. Ramana, the then MLC M. V. S. Sarma and former Union Secretary E. A. S. Sarma participated and supported the cause. The former IAS officer wrote detailed letters to successive Chief Secretaries from S.P. Tucker onwards on the issue.Finally, in 2014 during Governor’s rule the Government of Andhra Pradesh terminated the lease agreement.

However, the tussle between the lessee firm and ZGS continues with the former demanding a compensation of ₹4 crore and a five-member committee appointed by the government stating that the firm had to pay a penalty of ₹2 crore.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/7jhmal/article30660806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/221609605col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/district-library-finally-gets-a-place-of-its-own/article30660810.ece
389,2020/01/27,Press the EVM button with such anger that the poll result is felt at Shaheen Bagh: Amit Shah,"Voting for the BJP in Delhi polls will prevent “thousands of incidents like Shaheen Bagh”, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said at an election meeting on Sunday.

Mr. Shah attacked the opposition leaders including AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on various issues and asserted that only Prime Minister Narendra Modi can ensure safety and security of the country.

Campaigning for the BJP candidate in Babarpur constituency, he said, “Your vote to BJP candidate will make Delhi and the country safe and prevent thousands of incidents like Shaheen Bagh.”

A large number of women have been holding a sit-in against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Shaheen Bagh in south east Delhi since mid December.

The protest, supported by people from different fields including politicians, Bollywood actors and academicians, has emerged as a symbol of anti-CAA agitation in the country.

“When you press the button (of EVM) on February 8, do so with such anger that its current (poll result) is felt at Shaheen Bagh,” the BJP leader said.

The BJP, seeking to come into power in Delhi after two decades, has brought the CAA at the centre stage of its campaigning for February 8 polls, with Mr. Shah and other BJP leaders hitting out at Mr. Kejriwal and Mr. Gandhi over the issue in meetings after meetings. Mr. Kejriwal has said the BJP wants to give citizenship to Pakistanis, the Home Minister claimed and asked the people “shouldn’t Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists who witnessed their women being raped, lost their properties in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan and who came to India over the past 70 years be given citizenship of this country.”

Targeting the AAP and the Congress over issues like abrogation of Article 370, JNU, Ram temple and anti CAA protests, Mr. Shah alleged that the parties opposed to the BJP and PM Modi fear a backlash from their vote-bank.

Addressing another election meeting earlier in Rohtas Nagar constituency, he asked the people, “Are you their votebank? Why do Rahul Baba and Kejriwal want to save Tukde Tukde gang that raised slogans for fragmentation of the country. They do this because of fear of their vote bank.”

The former BJP president also slammed Kejriwal government alleging the ruling AAP failed in fulfilling “all” its promises including construction of new schools and colleges, free wifi, installing of CCTV cameras, supplying clean water, reducing pollution, building roads and cleaning the Yamuna.

“If there was a survey of lying and making false promises, Kejriwal government would top it,” he said.

HM Shah promised that if voted to power in Delhi, the BJP will ensure two-room houses to city’s slum dwellers in five years.

392,2020/01/27,Australian author Lisa Heidke breaks down the label of chick-lit,"Lisa Heidke’s head is a labyrinth of narratives — plotlines, characters, backstories, crises... She is always thinking about how her character would think and behave. When I meet the Australian author, she is diligently scrolling through her phone at the soberly-lit lobby of Taj Club House.

Known for her character-driven, light-hearted novels, the latest being It Started with a Kiss, she is nothing short of a burst of energy. Punctuated by the occasional ‘yeah’, she talks with fervour about the dos and don’ts of writing fiction, her journey as an author, and why ‘chick-lit’ is an unnecessary categorisation. Heidke was in the city for the international conference on Gendering Literature and Culture: Australia & the Asia-Pacific, hosted by the Madras University last week.

Though Heidke did journalism at the University of Queensland, she ended up in the field of academic publishing. But soon enough, she realised she could not do without writing — she donned the garb of a feature writer, working with popular magazines of the time. “Writing isn’t about getting a perfect draft. It is about rewriting. The hardest part of writing, for me, was to find the confidence to keep going — it was daunting.”

Heidke recalls her initial fear, adding that it all boils down to the question of ‘Who am I?’, the answer to which ultimately reflects in one’s writing. Heidke’s characters almost always finds themselves in crises, she admits. Which prompts her to answer questions that arise out of this crisis. “I go, ‘what if?’. I tend to pile problems on. It’s sort of like trying to throw mud at a wall and seeing what sticks,” Heidke explains with a laugh.

She adds that she often feels bad for her characters. But her writing is laced with humour — not “gags”, but unlikely and awkward situations. In It Started with a Kiss, the protagonist Friday’s best friend Rosie is a character lends that itself to humour (she comes up with an idea for what she calls ‘divorce’ parties). “I am mindful of my style, but at the same time, I have to keep surprising my readers,” Heidke says.

Heidke is also a creative writing trainer at the Australian Writers’ Centre in Sydney — a job she loves. “Regardless of genre, elements of the craft remain the same: points of view, dialogues, three-dimensional characters, and the aspect of beginning, middle and end.”

For young writers, Heidke has only two questions — “What do you want to write about; and why do you want to write about it? If you get bored with your characters, readers are going to feel the same.”

Most of Heidke’s works are referred to as ‘chick-lit’. Though the author does not believe that ‘chick-lit’ is a derogatory term, she does believe that it is just a marketing tool. If a story is about women and their relationships, written in a humorous way, it is categorised as chick-lit — she goes on to question the necessity of such a label. “They don’t say that about the fiction that men write. Which is what bothers me. Call it whatever! As long as people enjoy my books, I am good!”",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/w162qh/article30666029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LisaHeidke1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/australian-author-lisa-heidke-sits-with-metroplus-to-break-down-the-label-of-chick-lit/article30666030.ece
393,2020/01/27,JLF in your ear with Jaipur Bytes,"The Jaipur Literature Festival’s 2020 edition ends today. Bringing Indian and international literary and thought-provoking voices together, the fest has over the last decade established itself as a place for ideas and discussions, with more than it’ share of popular, crowd-drawing headliners. An archive of their panel discussions therefore, is a good way to look back on the various thoughts exchanged here, and go back to them, as we go back to books and published interviews.

While one place for this is the fest’s YouTube channel – it also show sessions live – over the last year, JLF’s collaboration with a podcaster called Lakshya Datta has resulted in the sessions also being archived in audio in an “official JLF podcast” called Jaipur Bytes.

With JLF now expanding its brand to run literary festivals in Australia, Ireland, Qatar, the United States, and Canada, the podcast is a year-long series. The episodes are a mix of edited live recordings from the sessions and exclusive one-on-one interviews that Datta, who was a finance professional not too long ago, conducts.

Jaipur Bytes is one of three shows that Datta oversees with his six-year-old digital storytelling company Launchora. The other two shows are Vision Nari, which narrates inspiring stories of “visionary Indian women”, and Storytalking with Lakshya, in which Datta talks about the process of storytelling.

The company, which started off as a creative writing community (not very different from the early days of Tumblr, creative writing sites like NaNoWriMo Camp, or various spaces on Reddit) currently has an average demographic of “70% under the age of 25, of which 60-65% is female and mostly about 16 years old”. In 2020, Datta aims to expand its scope and “go all in on podcasting”.

In this interview, he talks about why JLF works as a podcast, and how he curates the show.

Edited excerpts.

Why is it relevant to have JLF sessions accessible to digital audiences also via podcast?

People still play videos [on YouTube] from the festival from four years ago, but there’s usually a drop off from the first two minutes. Streaming a video isn’t always possible, say during commute. But a podcast is distraction free, and it costs less in terms of data. Audio is more convenient.

The episodes are free to access, too. How’s this working in terms of viability for Launchora?

Firstly, because I’m a writer, I'm a fan of literature. The cost is really my time and I see the value of investing in these ideas. But it’s amazing that we also just got sponsors for some of our episodes – for instance, the Bank of Baroda has just come on board for an epsiode.

How do you decide which sessions make it on Jaipur Bytes, and how do you choose the interviewees for your exclusives?

Mostly, [for exclusives] we just define it with: Who is going to retweet this episode? If it’s a Shashi Tharoor session, I’ll include it – he’s just that popular. Because currently, across all platforms we have maybe 1,000 or 1,500 followers. And by that I mean people who actually press “follow”. And sometimes, episodes with people like Nilesh Mishra, for example just spike. He’s really well known in the audio circles, and even though his episode is from last January, it still gets about 50 listens a week. (These numbers are for those who stay listening for more than 30 seconds). For live sessions, we go for ideas that will be unique and timeless. The idea is that if you find this episode three months later, the conversation should be valid, you should be able to learn something new from it.

394,2020/01/27,I always visualise before penning down the story: Ruskin Bond,"Famous Indian author Ruskin Bond has said that he always visualises the plot and listens to the characters converse among themselves before he puts it down in writing.

Bond, who was speaking at a discussion at the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet here on Sunday, was asked if he suffers from ‘writer’s block’ any time and replied in the negative.

“I am often asked if I suffer from ‘writer’s block’. Before I write a story, I visualise, listen to the characters converse,” The Blue Umbrella writer said.

The Sahitya Akademi award winner said the story is already thought, conceived, and then it is put to paper “using good words and sentence.”

“(It is like) You see a film and (then) transfer it into language,” he explained.

Bond said if a writer suffers from ‘writer’s block’, the best part could be putting the scrap into waste paper basket and coming back to the plot two-three days later.

The famous author said he had never thought about “touching up or editing” his first novel, The Room on the Roof which he had written at the age of 17.

“The Room on the Roof remains close to my heart and even though in later years I had thought about some mistakes in my first novel, I had never corrected these. I wanted it to remain as it is — representing an author of 17 years,” he said.

The Padma Shri awardee, whose Our Trees Still Grow in Dehra got the Sahitya Akademi award, said “my books didn’t sell in early days. I used to visit book shops and see if they have my book.”

The 85-year old, who has written several novels, over 500 short stories, as well as various essays and poems, said “I have been writing stories and I love writing which is fun.”

He later told PTI, “Children are always fascinated by thrillers and ghost stories, as both (thrillers and ghost tales) have certain elements which hook readers.”

Though Congress gave a tough fight and got majority in municipalities like Narayankhed, where it won one more ward than the TRS and at Cheriyal where it had an equal tally with the ruling party, the ex-officio vote proved costly for the opposition. In one municipality — IDA Bollaram — it was the TRS rebel candidate who won the chairperson post with support of both Congress and BJP.

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao closely monitored the developments and guided the party leadership locally. Tension prevailed for some time at Bollaram during the chairperson elections and police were forced to resort to lathicharge to control the agitating mob.

An independent member Marathi Jamuna joined the TRS while two Congress members expressed their support to the ruling party.

With this, the party’s corporator from 11th division Dandu Neethu Kiran was elected Mayor defeating the BJP candidate Lavanya with a majority of 9 votes. Ms. Neetu got 38 votes while her rival got 29 in the 60-division corporation. Member of Parliament D. Arvind (BJP), MLCs D. Rajeswar, Akula Lalitha and V.G. Goud, MLAs Bigala Ganesh Gupta, Bajireddy Govardhan and A. Jeevan Reddy (all TRS) participated in the election. TRS Rajya Sabha member D. Srinivas did not enrol for the voting and abstained.

Mr. Ganesh Gupta brought the sealed cover supposed to have been received from his party high command containing the name of Mayor in the morning.

Earlier, Joint Collector and presiding officer R. Venkateswarlu administered oath of office to the 60 corporators. The 3rd division corporator Srinivas Reddy proposed Ms. Neethu’s name as Mayor and Kalpana of 34 division seconded her name. Ms. Lavanya, elected from BJP in division No. 22, was proposed by her party member Narsaiah from division No.20 and seconded by 4th division member Promode Kumar.

The AIMIM corporator from 14th division Mohammed Idris Khan has been elected Deputy Mayor and Abdul Quddus of TRS and Akbar Hussain of AIMIM respectively proposed and seconded his name. He defeated Mallesh Yadav (BJP) of 23rd division. Immediately after, the presiding officer declared their election and took signatures. Earlier, TRS and BJP corporators-elect along with their leaders arrived in luxury buses at new Ambedkar Bhavan, venue of the election from their camps.

397,2020/01/27,How you can become a part of the global Great Backyard Bird Count that begins from February 14 to 17,"All you need to do is spend 20 minutes each day over four days (February 14 - 17) and write down the birds you see. If you do that you are a valuable contributor to the global Great Backyard Bird Count (GBBC). “The findings by every single participant of this activity counts” says P. Jeganathan of Tamil Birders Network, adding, “Did you know that it was during the GBBC in the U.S that birders learnt of the population and distribution of the Eurasian-collared Dove?”

Mittal Gala who is the Programme Co-ordinator of Bird Count India, an organisation that promotes bird listing, documentation and monitoring says, “The Great Backyard Bird Count was launched in 1988 by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and National Audubon Society in the US. Since 2013, this event is observed in many other countries including ours.” According to Jeganathan, there was a Christmas Bird Count in the US in the 80s that kick started the ‘stop hunting, start counting’ culture.

This annual activity aims to answer important questions. How are birds distributed? Are they affected by changes in habitat and weather? Has the population been changing from year-to-year? “It also helps to disprove unscientific data,” says Jeganathan. For example, the house sparrows. “It was said the mobile towers brought down the population of the birds. This is not true. The mapping of sparrows during the bird count clearly shows them distributed across the world. The findings of the common birder goes a long way in conservation. It gives a picture of the current status of birds and whether they are threatened. For instance, in Kerala, the data from backyard bird count helped save the wetlands.”

“We have been actively participating for the last three years,” says K. Selvaganesh, who teaches English at Cinchona Government High School in Valparai. Along with his students, he won ebird’s Great Backyard Bird Count challenge 2017. They contributed 360 checklists of birds, the highest number in the bird count challenge, and recorded 111 species. They could do this because their school is located at an altitude of 1100 mts in the south of the Western Ghats, Anamalai Hills. This is a hotspot of birds, both endemic and migratory. “During the count we could study the migratory pattern and distribution of the Grey Wagtail. It comes from the Himalayan region to the Southern part of Peninsular India. The cumulative data from across the world helped us track its path.”

Mittal says the objective is not just to record bird species but also to get an understanding of the common birds around us. “Before GBBC, if someone asked us what was the most common bird species in India we did not have a clear answer. But now we can now say with confidence that the two of the most common species across the country are the Red-vented Bulbul and Common Myna. The data has helped to understand our birds better. It has also initiated new people in bird watching and bird monitoring, who have gone on to help with conservation efforts.”

Take notes! From February 1 4 to 17. Be it your backyard, a garden, a wetland or wildlife reserve - you can count birds anywhere in the world and from any location. Go birding for at least 15 minutes, counting and noting down the species you see and hear. It doesn’t matter if you can’t identify every bird — what you can describe good enough!

Login to www.ebird.org/india and submit your list

eBird is an online platform where birdwatchers can enter their bird observations. It acts like an online notebook where one can enter date, time, location, species and the count of each species you see during the birding excursion. It helps you maintain lists, add photographs and birdcalls.

If you have an android device, download eBird app. Create an account and install the India pack. Set preferences relevant to India. Submit a list.

Since it started in 2013 there has been an increase in the number of bird watchers and check lists each year. Of the 13.7 million records from India on eBird, one million have been uploaded during the GBBCs (2013 to 2019). In the 2019 edition alone, the GBBC engaged over 1,786 birders who uploaded over 22,273 lists and reported 852 species

R. Mohammed Saleem of Environment Conservation Group also believes that the count will initiate more people into birding. He himself has been a part of the GBBC India for many years. “A number of educational institutions as well as corporates take part in their campus. Some of them of go on to become regular bird watchers,” he says. Saleem says the e-Bird app is a handy tool as it lists out birds in a particular locality. “You have to briefly describe the activity, if the bird was eating, nesting or fighting or taking off and if it was a male or a female. You can also upload bird calls on the app. During one such bird count activities, we observed the nesting of Black-naped monarch flycatcher at Walayar.”

Saleem and his team also documented the Black Baza at Sadivayal near Siruvani. “It's a winter visitor and we saw more than 10 of them. When this data is correlated with other data from across the globe we get a population mapping of the bazas. A number of studies of Amur Falcons that migrates from Russia and Siberia to Africa via Nagaland in India was also facilitated by the bird count.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/gok48x/article30664546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASIANPARADISEFLYCATCHER,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/how-you-can-become-a-part-of-the-global-great-backyard-bird-count-that-begins-from-february-14-to-17/article30664549.ece
398,2020/01/27,The wind among Kochi’s ‘Toppers’,"“The winds begin to blow inwards — from the sea on to the land — only by noon. It’s the ideal time to lower the sail boats on the water. By evening, when the wind drops and changes directions, we return,” says OC Thomas, sailing enthusiast and founder of Global Sailing Club.

Situated in Cheppanam, Panangad, the club hugs a shimmering expanse of clear waters that are part of the greater Vembanad lake. On Sunday, it will host the Rainforest Sailing Regatta using Topper Class category boats on January 26.

“The Toppers are very popular world-standard sail boats. We are using the event to build momentum and have charted out a series of training programmes and camps till May for children, enthusiasts, newcomers and veterans to learn and enjoy the sport,” says Thomas. This event is being held for the first time with plans to hold it annually.

Karl Damschen chips in, “If we had half of these waters and such this weather in Europe, everybody would be out on boats.” The Swiss restoration architect and kayaker lives in Kochi with wife Annalise who conducts kayaking training at the club.

The club, which has 85 members, has been working to build a water-sports culture since it was founded in 2012 but the response has been lukewarm so far. Abraham Thomas who owns two types of boats — Laser (Olympic Class) and Go Cat (Sailing catamaran) — learnt from his father at Kottayam Sailing Club. He sails regularly and rues the fact that there are very few people on the waters.

Training for this event has already begun. Six teenagers are learning the basics of sailing under trainer Rajesh D. “Sailing is only about wind power. There are no engines or pedals. It is about handling body weight, vessel weight and the wind,” he says.

Rajesh teaches beginners how to rig a boat, knot ropes and negotiate the winds. “The learners are taught everything. Practice is vital. Once in the waters, they must be proficient to handle any eventuality. Even if the boat capsizes, they can easily haul it back,” says Rajesh adding that the big race is a triangular circuit on the lake marked by a buoy with flag at three points.

The Ernakulam Sailing Association (ESA) was founded seven years ago by Joe Nejedly, proprietor Praga Marine and current president of the Association. “We have 30 boats comprising Lasers, sailing catamarans, Gocats, The Optimist and more. The optimist is for children and almost 80 % children who win medals start with The Optimist,” says Joe.



The club at Panangad is a site of hectic activity every weekend where 15-20 keen sailors assemble and set out. “We have life membership and also a sailing membership that allows for temporary experiences,” says Joe. The club has hosted three National Championships, the last one being a 60-boat regatta in Cherai in 2015.

The Toppers, he explains, is a cross between an advanced category boat and a beginner’s boat, perfect for a tyro.

Thrissur-based entrepreneur Varghese James Cheeran, 43, is a kayakar who has been training regularly. The sailing experience is very different, he says. “ It needs a lot of application, an understanding of the winds, practice, co-ordination and is much more fun.” He adds that ideally the technique should be learnt when young as it requires fitness and flexibility.

Retd. Commodore TK Ashokan, the club’s president, says that the club has invested in top-class equipment, trainers and facilities to promote water sports. “We are serious about kayaking and sailing and are looking for sporting excellence. There is a general lack of both awareness and facilities. Such events help bring more people onto the waters.”

So far there are six registrations from children and two adults, one each from Thrissur and Kottayam; people can also sign up for beginners class. People can watch the race from the coast around the lake in Cheppanam.

Karl says Kerala has ideal conditions for water sports. However, Thomas points out that many parents who object to these activities due to fear, and thus nurture a phobia for water. Cdr Sam T Samuel, co-founder Kalypso Adventures, agrees adding that white water rafting begun by his company too had few takers because of this fear factor. “The priority for us is to perform well only in academics; niche sports like this will suffer,” he says.

Round the year sailing and watermanship events of the Indian Navy are held in Kochi, (at all the training establishments under SNC), which include races in Enterprise and Laser Class boats and newer 29 Er, 49 Er and Hobbie cat boats. They also conduct coaching camps for children and unit level events for service personnel and families.



The Ocean Sailing Node set up at INS Mandovi, Goa in Aug 2016 with the aim to foster ‘ocean sailing’ amongst naval officers has a branch in Kochi. Routine sailing activities such as “away sail boats” and “whaler” sailing expeditions are conducted periodically for keeping the sailing skill alive amongst naval personnel.

Nevertheless, the club is gearing up for D Day. Rajesh, and co-ordinator Syam Mohandas, are busy with the participants readying them to enjoy a day of sailing.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/l918as/article30663572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPSAILING2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/the-wind-among-kochis-toppers/article30663574.ece
399,2020/01/27,More than eight decades of typewriting lessons for Kochi,"The click-clack of typewriter keys forms a kind background score at Ramakrishna Institute of Commerce on MG Road; it’s 11 in the morning and eight-10 students pore over papers as they type. Some hesitantly hit the keys while the faster ones barely look at them as they type. Speed and an error-free copy are the essence in typing, which can only be gained through practice. For the past 85 years the Institute has been training students in typewriting and shorthand.

In the early 1950s there were around 80 typewriting institutes in and around Kochi. Learning, what some refer to as, the ‘twin arts’ was a rite of passage. Today the number of such institutes in the city has shrunk to four or five, some run with a couple of machines. “The people who started these are my father, Krishna Iyer’s contemporaries — those who studied with him or learnt from him,” says TK Narayana Swamy who runs Ramakrishna Institute.

For the 64-year-old, the institute has been his life especially since Krishna Iyer’s death in 1999. With the arrival of computers, in the mid 1990s, there was a dip in students which led Narayana Swamy to set up an internet café instead. The lull was temporary; by 2000-02 the students were back.

Today he has around 90 to 100 students, the number varies. A reason for the interest is that computer-related secretarial and clerical jobs, especially in government service, demand typing skills and proof of having passed a typewriting exam, for instance Kerala Government Technical Education (KGTE), MGTE (Maharashtra) or TNGTE (Tamil Nadu).

Shorthand however doesn’t have as many takers, Narayana Swamy has 30 students for the nine-month course. Sumal Raj has learnt typing and is trying to master short hand, “The advantage of learning both is that one gets access to many more job opportunities — read vacancies — where there aren’t many applicants.”

In the late 1920s, a young TR Krishna Iyer moved to Ernakulam, from his home town Thriprayar, near Thrissur, looking for better opportunities. The search led him to Champion’s Institute, a typewriting and shorthand institute, run by Seetharama Iyer, on Market Road. By 1935 Krishna Iyer, who learnt both, opened a branch of the institute near the Ernakulam Siva Temple. On January 26, 1952, he christened it Ramakrishna Institute of Commerce and relocated to Jos Junction; it moved once more to its current location.

“He deliberately chose the day for its significance, every year afterwards the day was celebrated as annual day,” says Narayana Swamy. The day used to be celebrated at TDM Hall, but over the years the custom ceased due to the declining number of students and increasing costs.

This year, on January 26, however, 300-odd students — present and past — will get together to celebrate. “Rehearsals used to be compulsory, sir (Krishna Iyer) was very particular. We used to even had a mock chief guest,” MV Danaseelan, who retired from Fertilisers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT) as executive secretary. He has learnt both typing and shorthand, and was topper at any test in these subjects.

If the first batch had a handful of students, in its heyday, from the 1960s to the 90s, the institute had more than 300 students learning simultaneously in slots spread across the day from 6 am to 8 pm. The course taught English, as well as typing in Malayalam and Hindi. The Institute was also in charge of conducting typewriting exams for organisations, assessing speed and correctness.

Chasing typewriters The production of Godrej typewriters stopped 11 years ago, in 2009, which resulted in institutes such as this taking a hit when it comes to access to machines. As of now there are 14 machines, and Narayana Swamy has around 20-odd more. The machines are either Godrej or Facit. “Since I work constantly with these I know how to repair them. Spare parts are not easy to find locally, I use parts from other typewriters. Or one has to get them from Delhi, which is not often feasible.” While English typewriters are easy to find, Malayalam typewriters are elusive. They are in demand in Tamil Nadu where they are rigged to type in Tamil font. Narayana Swamy tried to organise an exhibition of typewriters but gave up. “There were machines people were ready to junk, when I asked for those the owners jacked up the price.”

It has provided stenographers/typists to a number of local companies, FACT was one such. “Those days it was word-of-mouth, MKK Nayar was known to my father and any time he wanted to hire staff he would call,” says Narayana Swamy. Krishna Iyer was stenographer to the Chief Justice of the Kerala High Court, MS Menon and also Sir Robert Bristow, who played a pivotal role in the development of the Kochi port. “My father used to go to the boat jetty, where a boat would come to fetch him to Bristow’s office. My father told us about how he would be fed bread, butter and milk as refreshment and then ferried back,” he adds.

The institute boasts a list of illustrious students – the late Ambady Vishwanatha Menon, former Finance Minister, A Ramachandran, former Registrar CUSAT, and AK Seshadri, former Mayor, among others.

Narayana Swamy has no intention of stopping either of these classes, which he conducts with his wife Kala, “The number of students points to an upward trend, 8,000 students appeared for KGTE last year. This figure is likely to go up,” he says.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/jv0a40/article30663506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25KIMPTYPEWRITING,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/the-ramakrishna-institute-of-commerce-which-completed-85-years-this-republic-day-takes-forward-a-long-legacy-of-teaching-typewriting/article30663511.ece
400,2020/01/27,Gaps in our knowledge of coronavirus origin need fulfilment: Study,"“The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies,” noted a study titled — “Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China”, published in The Lancet this past week.

The study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission.

The recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), notes the study.

The study found that by January 2, 2020, 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men, less than half had underlying diseases including diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular ailments.

Also 27 (66%) of the 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found.

Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever, cough and fatigue with less common ones being sputum production, headache and diarrhoea.

All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT.

For the study, researchers collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR (Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of RNA into DNA) and next-generation sequencing.

“Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not,” said the study.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/gi9f80/article30668940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-NEPAL-CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/gaps-in-our-knowledge-of-coronavirus-origin-need-fulfilment-lancet-study/article30668941.ece
401,2020/01/27,‘How much activity is okay after a heart attack?’,"My father, who is 75 years old, has had hypertension for more than 35 years, with a couple of episodes of blackout. A year ago, he was diagnosed with 80 to 90% blockage in two arteries and stents were inserted. Ever since, he has lost a lot of weight and the blackouts have returned. Does it indicate something serious?

Blackouts, especially at that elderly age, may not be related to the blockage in the blood vessels of the heart. They may be related to slowing of the heart rate due to disturbances in the electrical cables of the heart (conduction system). Conditions such as sick sinus syndrome (a sluggish natural pacemaker in the heart) or heart blocks (in the cables), which cause such slowing, are more common in the elderly.

Sometimes, rapid heart beat triggered by electrical short circuits in the heart can also cause blackouts, as can neurological disturbances. Even medicines taken for lowering blood pressure may cause a marked drop in blood pressure when an elderly person stands up (postural hypotension) and cause a blackout.

Do consult a cardiologist who can clinically examine and investigate to find out which of these is the cause of blackouts. Tests, such as Holter monitoring, often help in the diagnosis of heart rate and rhythm disturbances.

If cardiac causes are ruled out, the cardiologist will refer your father to a neurologist. The elderly also tend to suffer from hyponatremia (low level of blood sodium) which can cause unconsciousness — blood tests will reveal that. The cause of severe weight loss also needs investigations beyond the cardiac tests.

I am 47 years old and I suffered a heart attack in November last year. My family is constantly worried and is always asking me to reduce my activities and work load. How much activity is usually okay?

The amount of activity you can safely do is determined by the cardiac function, which is usually assessed by measuring the pumping efficiency of the heart (ejection fraction) that can be assessed by echocardiography (Echo test). That efficiency is determined by how much of your heart muscle was affected by the heart attack.

Whether you can undertake a certain level of exercise without experiencing deficiency of blood flow to the unaffected portion of your heart is usually assessed by an exercise test (also called a ‘stress test’). Echo and Exercise tests are a part of the standard assessment for a person who has recovered from a heart attack. Your cardiologist would have performed these on you. That assessment will guide you on the permissible level of activity.

In general, being physically active is beneficial after recovery from a heart attack, unless there are specific reasons for which your doctor has advised you not to. Regular physical activity reduces the risk of a future heart attack and strengthens the heart muscle. So, consult your doctor and liberate your family from their fear. It is understandable that they are concerned but they should not make you inactive, as that is not good for your heart. Do, however, reduce mentally stressful work tasks.

India chief coach Sjoerd Marijne was disappointed with the result.

“We created enough scoring opportunities but were not productive enough. It is not about how many opportunities you create but how effective you are. New Zealand were stronger today and in the beginning we were struggling with that. But after the first quarter, we played much better.
