0,2020/01/13,Delhi International Open chess| Himal Gusain stuns Visakh,"It is a rarity to find a Chandigarh-based player getting the better of a Grandmaster from Tamil Nadu. Himal Gusain pulled off the improbable at the expense of N.R. Vishakh and jumped to the joint second spot after seven rounds of the Delhi International Open Grandmasters chess tournament here on Monday.

With 11 of the top-15 boards ending in draws, leader Aleksej Aleksandrov easily continued his reign at the top with 6.5 points. His compatriot from Belarus Alexie Fedorov and Gusain followed at six points. A bunch of 14 players were at 5.5 points.

In the midst of the drawn games, 33-move victories for Gusain and Fedorov stood out.

Gusain’s triumph over Visakh, following the opening sequence of Sicilian Defence, was the result of some smart pawn-play. Once most of the major pieces were exchanged, Gusian’s advancing queen-rook pawn, with knight providing the guiding light, left Visakh with no choice but to give up.

Fedorov’s victory was made easy with a tactical sequence that helped him emerge with a rook for a bishop. Ortim Nigmatov resigned when he saw no way of saving the bishop.

Top seed Farrukh Amonatov drew for the third round on the trot while second seed Pavel Ponkratov ended his four-draw sequence with his third win.

M. Pranesh continued his unbeaten sequence by holding GM Kirill Stupak. Rated a modest 2317, Pranesh has faced four GMs so far and reached 5.5 points by performing at 2570-level.

Important results (seventh round): Aleksej Aleksandrov (Blr, 6.5) drew with Adam Tukhaev (Ukr, 5.5); Florian Kuczur (5.5) drew with Jose Eduardo Martinez Alcantra (Per, 5.5); Karthik Venkatraman (5.5) drew with Ivan Rozum (Rus, 5.5).

Alexei Fedorov (Blr, 6) bt Ortim Nigmatov (Uzb, 5); Diptayan Ghosh (5.5) drew with Maxim Lugovksoy (Rus, 5.5); Himal Gusain (6) bt N.R. Visakh (5); M. Pranesh (5.5) drew with Kirill Stupak (Blr, 5.5); P. Shyam Nikhil (5) drew with Farrukh Amonatov (Tjk, 5); C.R.G. Krishna (4.5) lost to Abhijeet Gupta (5.5); Sayantan Das (4.5) lost to Nodirbek Yakubboev (Uzb, 5.5).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/d64bd3/article30560687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14-Gusain,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/chess-himal-gusain-stuns-visakh/article30560688.ece
1,2020/01/13,Anand loses to So,"Viswanathan Anand crashed to a surprise 26-move defeat to Wesley So in the second round of the Tata Steel Masters chess tournament here on Sunday.

On a day when four players won with white pieces, Anand was apparently surprised by the choice of line chosen by So in Giuoco Piano. Anand sacrificed a piece in vain to get out of trouble and then missed a possible way drawing the game before giving up.

Five players shared the lead with 1.5 points.

In Group B, Surya Shekhar Ganguly (1.5) and Nihal Sarin (1) played with black and drew their games against Lucas van Foreest and Pavel Eljanov, respectively.

The results:

Second round: Wesley So (USA, 1.5) bt Viswanathan Anand (0.5); Xiong Jeffery (USA, 1.5) bt Jorden van Foreest (Ned, 1); Vladislav Artemiev (Rus, 1.5) bt Nikita Vitiugov (Rus, 0.5); Daniil Dubov (Rus, 1.5) bt Vladislav Kovalev (Blr, 0); Anish Giri (Ned, 1) drew with Fabiano Caruana (USA, 1); Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Pol, 1) drew with Alireza Firouza (FIDE, 1.5); Yu Yangyi (Chn, 0.5) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 1).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/anand-loses-to-so/article30558844.ece
2,2020/01/13,"Badminton world No.1 Kento Momota injured in car crash in Malaysia, driver killed","Badminton world number one Kento Momota was injured in a pre-dawn vehicle collision in Malaysia on Monday, just hours after he secured his first victory of the season at the Malaysia Masters.

The Japanese shuttler and three others were thought to have been en-route to Kuala Lumpur international airport when the hired van they were in rammed into the rear of a 30-tonne truck, according to statements from the police and local fire department.

The driver of the van was killed in the incident, and his body had to be cut free from the wreckage.

Police and Malaysia's badminton association (BAM) said that in addition to Momota, the three others involved in the incident were his physiotherapist, his assistant coach and a Badminton World Federation official.

The association said in a statement that Momota suffered multiple lacerations to his face and a fractured nose.

Japanese ambassador to Malaysia Hiroshi Oka speaks to members of media after visiting Japanese badminton player Kento Momota who was injured in a pre-dawn vehicle collision in Putrajaya, Malaysia, January 13, 2020. | Photo Credit: Reuters

Malaysia's Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said the four were in stable condition and would be discharged once hospital officials were satisfied they were fit to be released.

“Based on investigations and CT scans, there are no major injuries... they are now stable and will be given continued treatment and remain under observation for now,” Dzulkefly said briefly outside Putrajaya Hospital where the four are being treated.

Japan's ambassador to Malaysia, Hiroshi Oka, who was with Dzulkefly on the visit, was grateful for the “care and support” given to those involved in the crash.

On Sunday, Momota defeated former world champion Viktor Axelsen to win the Malaysia Masters, the first tournament of the BWF 2020 World Tour season.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/5oepw2/article26476728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09MOMOTA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/badminton-world-no1-kento-momota-injured-in-car-crash-in-malaysia-driver-killed/article30555915.ece

7,2020/01/13,"Privacy, ‘anticipatory homes’, food tech and more: How CES 2020 was geared towards ‘practical futurism’","If there is one thing to say about technology in the 2010s, it is that the industry went through an identity evolution. This was reflected in the annual United States-based CES, hosted and organised by Consumer Technology Association. Though CES 2020 (January 7 to January 10) took place across three geographical areas: Tech East, Tech West and Tech South in Las Vegas, the rest of the world is never left out, thanks to the live-streams.

Since its first show in 1967 in New York, the innovations got weirder, but there was a purposefulness in even the most indulgent exhibitions. And this year’s expo was no different. Already making headlines, are a 5G PC from Lenovo, humanoid robots, alien-esque cars from Mercedes-Benz and Byton Ltd, the far reach of 5G, and increasingly immersive gaming gear.

Like the eye-catching gadgetry on show, the Supersessions (discussions) around what the world could expect — in not just 2020 but the next decade, too — drew attention. That said, the interest around CES lies in the fact that, unlike most tech expos, CES sees perspectives from both enthusiasts and sceptics.

Drive to be ‘good’

The ongoing Fourth Industrial Revolution we live in raises a lot of questions around ethical technology, and one cannot only allude to the right implementation and consumption of technology, but also research and development of smart infrastructure.

At a fireside chat titled ‘What’s Next for the Fourth Industrial Revolution?’, Barbara Humpton, CEO of Siemens USA, suggested that rather than waiting for regulatory practices to be enforced, tech companies can be ahead of the curve and integrate that behaviour from the get-go to establish the norm.

These practices, adds Humpton, can be applied to largely societal and sustainable goals — food practices, climate change, philanthropy, etc — for corporations across the spectrum in any given geography. On the floor, the advent of faux pork by Impossible Foods played into this.

Privacy by design

The horror stories around smart homes have been prevalent, and tech giants Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple were placed in the hot seat.

Google introduced two new voice commands — ‘Hey Google, that wasn’t for you’ and ‘Hey Google, are you saving my audio data?’ — which claim to have a tighter grip on privacy control. Upon these commands, the user can adjust privacy setting or simply know what the deal is.

A January 7 panel titled ‘Chief Privacy Officer Roundtable: What Do Consumers Want?’ featured Jane Horvath, Apple’s senior director of global privacy, alongside Erin Egan, Facebook’s vice president of public policy and chief privacy officer, Susan Shook, global privacy officer at The Procter & Gamble Company, as well as Rebecca Slaughter, commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission, the US watchdog agency that imposed a $5 billion penalty on Facebook over privacy breaches.

All the panellists agreed that enough can never be done in the realm of privacy. Slaughter added that what needs to be done cannot be generalised; potential actions taken are industry-specific and company-specific, and that the whole conundrum is a “solvable problem” on a policy level.

Egan announced Facebook’s updated their Privacy Checkup tool; a move they claim will promise better transparency... but the world has learned that everything Facebook says should be taken with a bucket of salt.

One of the biggest concerns in the 2010s was targeted advertising, to which Shook revealed P&G’s focus is now on a “consumer-centric privacy framework.”

Unfortunately, in response, many audience members bemoaned that the epiphany of information sovereignty has come too late, and that it is time for these corporations to walk the talk.

The era of anticipation

CES always hints that many of these technologies which initially sat on the fringes would become the norm someday — which can be exciting and unnerving.

A CNET Next Big Thing talk titled ‘IoT: Moving Into An Anticipatory Tech World’ addressed how, in the next few years, technology “will make things happen [for consumers] before they ask for them to happen.”

The talk had experts such as Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Rana El Kaliouby, co-founder and CEO of Affectiva, Doug Clinton, managing partner at Loup Ventures, and Michele Turner, senior director of Google Smart Home Ecosystem.

The home and wellness sectors will see far more automation and more control from the consumer, says Lindsey Turrentine, senior vice president of CBS Interactive Tech. In other words, leave the terminology of ‘smart’ behind, the more becoming term being ‘anticipatory’.

8,2020/01/13,"Queen Elizabeth II agrees period of transition for Prince Harry, Meghan","Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II on Monday agreed to offer Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle a “period of transition” during which the couple can divide their time between the UK and Canada.

After her first face-to-face talks with her grandson and senior members of the royal family at the 93-year-old monarch’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, Buckingham Palace issued a statement, saying as the transition period kicks in right away, the “complex” matter of the couple’s future roles will be fleshed out in the coming days.

The statement notes that the discussions had proved “constructive” and that the royal family was supportive of the young couple’s desire to create a more independent life for themselves.

“Today my family had very constructive discussions on the future of my grandson and his family,” according to the statement issued in the name of the Queen after the so-called ‘Sandringham Summit’

“My family and I are entirely supportive of Harry and Meghan’s desire to create a new life as a young family. Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the royal family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family,” it reads.

In reference to the complex financial issues involved, it adds: “Harry and Meghan have made clear that they do not want to be reliant on public funds in their new lives.

“It has therefore been agreed that there will be a period of transition in which the Sussexes will spend time in Canada and the UK. These are complex matters for my family to resolve, and there is some more work to be done, but I have asked for final decisions to be reached in the coming days“.

Royal experts interpreted the historic statement as a favourable outcome for Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, who had issued a statement last week to reveal plans to step back as senior royals and take on a semi-independent role while setting up a second home in North America with their eight-month-old son Archie.

Markle is already in Canada to be with Archie and is believed to have joined the discussions over telephone.

Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, and their father Charles, the Prince of Wales, had all been invited to the emergency meeting at the Queen’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

It was the first time the monarch came face-to-face with Harry since the Sussex crisis exploded to determine the couple’s future roles and decide if they will retain their royal titles as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.

The couple made their bombshell announcement on Wednesday that they intend to “step back” from being frontline royals, split their time between the UK and North America, and work towards becoming “financially independent“.

The Queen traditionally remains at Sandringham in the Norfolk county of England after Christmas until February 6, the anniversary of the death of her father, King George VI.

Earlier, William had spoken of his “sadness” at the broken bond with his younger brother.

According to ‘The Times’, William told a friend: “I’ve put my arm around my brother all our lives and I can’t do that any more; we’re separate entities“.

The brothers were seen as being close until a split emerged months after Harry’s wedding to Markle in May 2017 when they decided to divide up their joint charitable foundation.

Harry is due to make his first public appearance on Thursday since renouncing his senior royal role, when he will host the Rugby League World Cup 2021 draws for the wheelchair tournaments, at Buckingham Palace.

The royal family was said to be “hurt” and “blindsided” by the couple’s shock announcement, which they said was finalised after “many months of reflection and internal discussions”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/j0tbfy/article30561471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINROYALRIFT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/queen-elizabeth-ii-agrees-period-of-transition-for-prince-harry-meghan/article30561472.ece
9,2020/01/13,Iran denies ‘cover-up’ as protests rage on,"Iran denied a “cover-up” Monday after taking days to reveal an airliner was accidentally shot down last week, a disaster that sparked demonstrations and calls for a fully transparent investigation.

“In these sorrowful days, many criticisms were directed at relevant officials and authorities,” said government spokesman Ali Rabiei.

“Some officials were even accused of lying and a cover-up but, in all honesty, that was not the case,” he said. “Lying is intentionally and knowingly faking the truth. Lying is covering up. Lying is knowing a fact and not expressing it or twisting the truth.”

The spokesman said all details provided by officials prior to Saturday’s revelation had been based on the information available to them at the time. “All of those who expressed opinions on those days, at the peak of America’s psychological war against the Iranian nation... did so based on existing information at the time.”

Meanwhile, Iranian anti-government protests were met with tear gas and left at least one person wounded, videos on social media appeared to show on Monday.

Videos show large crowds chanting slogans against the country’s authorities in Tehran’s iconic Azadi Square south of the centre.

In a video purporting to be from the city of Amol in the Mazandaran region on the Caspian Sea, a crowd marches, shouting, “We don’t want the Islamic republic”.

Germany’s Foreign Ministry said that the Iranians must be allowed to “protest peacefully and freely” and express their “grief” after the plane disaster.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-denies-cover-up-as-protests-rage-on/article30561361.ece
10,2020/01/13,Five countries to discuss action against Iran,"Five nations whose citizens died when an airliner was shot down by Iran last week will meet in London on Thursday to discuss possible legal action, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister said.

Speaking on the sidelines of an official visit to Singapore on Monday, Vadym Prystaiko said the countries would also discuss compensation and the investigation into the incident. All 176 people on board the flight died in the crash on Wednesday, minutes after the plane took off from Tehran airport.

Mr. Prystaiko said suggestions from Iran that the Ukrainian International Airlines plane was downed as it flew near a sensitive military base during a time of heightened tensions were “nonsense”. He said Tehran had agreed to hand over the plane’s black boxes to Kiev for investigation.

“We have created this group of Foreign Ministers from the grieving nations. On January 16, we will meet in person in London to discuss the ways, including legal, how we are following this up, how we are prosecuting them (Iran),” Mr. Prystaiko said.

He said the five nations also included Canada — which had at least 57 passport holders aboard the doomed flight — Sweden, Afghanistan and a fifth country, which he did not name.

Many on board were Iranians with dual citizenship.

After days of denials, Iran said on Saturday its military had shot down the plane in a “disastrous mistake”. Mr. Prystaiko said Ukraine was not informed by Iran that it would be taking responsibility before that public announcement.

Tehran said its air defences were fired in error while on alert after Iranian missile strikes on U.S. targets in Iraq.

“This is nonsense because our plane was recorded and confirmed — was going within the international route which was given by the dispatchers... Nothing was extraordinary,” Mr. Prystaiko said, adding that investigators said the pilot’s last words were “everything is ok on board and I am switching to auto pilot.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4sxok8/article30561324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Iran,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/five-countries-to-discuss-action-against-iran/article30561325.ece
11,2020/01/13,"William, Harry slam ‘false’ story about them","Princes William and Harry on Monday put on a rare united front to dismiss a “false story” speculating about their relationship, as senior royals meet for talks about the younger brother's future.

Prince Harry and his wife Meghan Markle caught the institution off guard last week when they announced their intention to step back from frontline royal duties.

The 35-year-old former Army officer has previously all but confirmed a rift with his older brother, prompting speculation as to the cause and that it may have influenced his decision to quit as senior royal.

Princes William and Harry, also known by their formal titles the Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex, issued a rare joint statement to condemn one report, without specifying the publication.

“Despite clear denials, a false story ran in a U.K. newspaper today speculating about the relationship between The Duke of Sussex and The Duke of Cambridge,” it said.

‘Bullying attitude’

“For brothers who care so deeply about the issues surrounding mental health, the use of inflammatory language in this way is offensive and potentially harmful.”

The Times cited an unnamed “insider” as saying Prince Harry and Ms. Markle felt they had been “pushed away by what they saw as a bullying attitude from the Duke of Cambridge”.

But it also cautioned: “These claims have been strongly contested by sources close to the Cambridges, as well as some close to Prince Harry.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/akp529/article30560919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Harry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/william-harry-slam-false-story-about-them/article30560920.ece
12,2020/01/13,Kashmir figured during talks between Modi and Macron: French government,"France is closely following the situation in Kashmir, the French government said on Monday and noted that the issue was discussed during a telephonic conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron three days ago.

A statement issued by Elys Palace said the two leaders discussed the situation in the region of Kashmir in the “spirit of trust and frankness” that characterises bilateral ties. “The French President and the Indian Prime Minister discussed the situation in the region of Kashmir, which France continues to follow closely,” the statement released here by the French Embassy said.

A statement issued by the Indian government on Friday after talks between Modi and Macron did not mention Kashmir. “The two leaders exchanged views on a range of issues of mutual interest in bilateral relations as well as regional and global situations,” the statement by the Prime Minister’s Office said.

Last week, the government took a group of 15 foreign envoys to Jammu and Kashmir to “see the efforts to bring back normalcy in the region” after abrogation of Article 370, the Ministry of External Affairs said. Envoys from European countries were not part of the group.

Views on West Asia

The French statement said Mr. Macron and Mr. Modi expressed their shared view on the necessity of de-escalation of tension in West Asia, adding that they agreed to work together towards easing tensions by urging the parties to show restraint and responsibility.

The region is witnessing increasing tensions after Major General Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite al-Quds force, was killed in a U.S. drone strike. Iran retaliated by targeting U.S. bases in Iraq with missile attacks. It said the two leaders expressed their interest in pursuing the strengthening of their partnership in military and civil nuclear fields as well as enhancing their operational cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.

“They reiterated their attachment to the full implementation of the goals defined during Prime Minister Modi’s visit to Chantilly on August 22, 2019 and India’s participation in the Biarritz G7 Summit,” it said.

“They agreed on the interest in intensifying ministerial visits in both countries in the course of this year,” the statement said.

13,2020/01/13,Mahinda Rajapaksa to visit New Delhi in February,"Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will visit New Delhi early February and meet his counterpart Narendra Modi, his office said.

The PM's media office told The Hindu that the dates, delegation and meetings are yet to be firmed up for the visit that also marks Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa’s first visit abroad after he was appointed Prime Minister by his younger brother President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa’s visit to New Delhi comes about two months after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa went to the Indian capital, following his decisive win in Sri Lanka’s November presidential polls. Last week, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Relations Minister Dinesh Gunawardena met External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in New Delhi, in the series of high-level visits from Colombo.

While key bilateral issues — including regional security and the much-discussed development cooperation at the East Container Terminal in Colombo and the Trincomalee oil tank farms — are on the table, his India visit will be closely watched for more reasons.

Addressing a joint press conference during Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s visit in November, Mr. Modi said that he was confident that Sri Lanka will carry forward the process of reconciliation, “to fulfil the aspirations of the Tamil for equality, justice, peace and respect.” In this context, Mr. Modi also referenced the implementation of the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan constitution — an outcome of the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987.

Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who served as President for two terms since 2005, has in the past assured India at least thrice that he would implement the 13th Amendment — which envisages greater power devolution to Provinces including those inhabited by Tamils — and “go beyond it”.

On the other hand, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who has promised to “be frank” with New Delhi, has repeatedly emphasised the need for development, not devolution, for the war-hit community.

Global outreach

The Sri Lankan PM’s visit comes at a time when the new government, helmed by the Rajapaksa brothers who have outlined a “neutral foreign policy”, is engaging with international partners at high levels.

Foreign Minister of China and State Councillor Wang Yi will be in Colombo on January 14 and meet the Sri Lankan President and the PM. Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Sergey Lavrov and the U.S. Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells, also visiting, are scheduled to meet the Sri Lankan leadership.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/on2iz1/article30551986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJAPAKSA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mahinda-rajapaksa-to-visit-new-delhi-in-february/article30558309.ece
14,2020/01/13,Lahore High Court annuls Musharraf’s death sentence,"In a huge relief for Pakistan’s self-exiled former dictator, the Lahore High Court on Monday declared Pervez Musharraf’s trial in the high treason case as “unconstitutional.”

A special court had given death sentence to the ex-Army chief on December 17 for holding the Constitution in abeyance.

Lawyer Usama Malik said the High Court pointed out that Cabinet approval wasn’t given for the formation of the special court and it was only constituted by the Prime Minister’s Office and the Interior Ministry, which is illegal.

The High Court said Section 9 of the Special Court Amendment Act was illegal as it violated Article 10-A of the Constitution, which is about fair trial.

Mr. Malik told The Hindu that according to the court, when emergency was declared in 2007 and the Constitution was held in abeyance, the punishment for holding Constitution in abeyance wasn’t death penalty as the offence wasn’t considered high treason. The High Court said this was added in the 18th Amendment passed in 2010.

The court said Gen. Musharraf cannot be punished for something that wasn’t punishable back then.

Mr. Malik said the government or Gen. Musharraf have not appealed the December 17 decision of the special court before the Supreme Court yet. Whether they will do so or not will be confirmed soon — presumably after the detailed High Court judgment comes out.

“Another point of view is that while constitution of the special court has been declared illegal, whether the punishment stands or not is important. We will know after the detailed judgment comes out. The High Court says that Article 6 doesn’t apply to the 2007 emergency as Article 232 gives power to the President to declare emergency under special circumstances,” Mr. Malik said.

Faisal Chaudhry, Additional Advocate General Punjab, said “it seems as if Musharraf has been exonerated by the High Court.”

Bars reaction

Asked about the future course of action, Mr. Chaudhry, who has also represented Gen. Musharraf in the treason case in the past, said that one will have to see how the legal fraternity like the Bar Associations and Supreme Court react. “There are fair chances that the Bars will react negatively to this verdict.”

A senior lawyer on the condition of anonymity said that after the passage of the Army Act, “Politics has been buried by the political parties themselves.”

The lawyer wondered what the Bar associations will do when all political parties have capitulated.

Abid Saqi, member of the Pakistan Bar Council, said, “Setting aside of the verdict of the special court without availing appellate court and getting reversal of that judgment through collateral proceedings is not just unprecedented but inconceivable.”

Reema Omer, legal adviser, South Asia International Commission of Jurists, said it would be premature to comment on the legal reasoning behind the High Court’s order before the detailed judgment is released, but from the reports of the proceedings, it appeared legally flawed and in contradiction with earlier Supreme Court judgments on the same issues.

“For instance, the SC had already decided the special court could continue with General Musharraf’s trial and the federal government could investigate other aiders and abettors separately if required. It had also ruled that unlawfully amending or suspending the Constitution amounted to subversion of the Constitution - which has been a part of Article 6 since 1973 - so the question of retrospective application of amendments to the provision in 2010 did not arise. However, these issues were still discussed again in the proceedings before the High Court.

“This is perhaps not surprising given General Musharraf’s lawyer, the Attorney General’s office, and the court-appointed amicus (Barrister Ali Zafar, a member of the PTI) were all on the infamous ‘same page’, and alternative points of view were not presented before the Court.”

15,2020/01/13,China fears CAA could have repercussions in Xinjiang,"The adoption of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which excludes citizenship for Muslim migrants who had illegally entered India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh before December 2014, is fuelling anxiety in China.

A Chinese official who did not wish to be named told The Hindu that Beijing apprehends that the law, if it alienates Muslims in India, could have repercussions in Xinjiang—a vast strategically important border region, which has faced separatist violence.

“We fear that if possible Muslim alienation triggered by India’s new Act spreads, it could channel into international terrorism and eventually bolter separatism in Xinjiang,” the official said.

Xinjiang is China’s strategic lifeline. The West-East gas pipeline network drawing gas from Central Asia along a land corridor helps fuel Beijing’s east coast industrial heartland—the workshop of the world, represented by Shanghai and Guangdong province.

China has also unveiled the Greater Bay Area plan, covering the economic integration of Guangdong with Hong Kong and Macao, requiring huge energy sources.

Apart from energy security, Xinjiang is also the “choke point” through which China is connected with Central Asia and Europe along a vast inter-continental transportation network under Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Besides, China views Xinjiang as central to the “one-China” policy, which also rejects efforts that encourage “separatism” in Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong and islands in the South China Sea. “Given Xinjiang’s extraordinary importance, China firmly rejects any moves to weaken the one-China principle on the grounds of human rights,” the official said.

China has blamed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM)—a terror group mainly comprising jihadists of ethnic Uyghur descent, for seeking an independent “East Turkestan” in Xinjiang.

In response to the CAA, a section of the Chinese state media has asserted that the new law mirrors India’s evolving geostrategic posture, in its South Asian neighbourhood, the Indian Ocean and beyond, fuelled by what is called, the rise “Hindu nationalism”.

An article in the state-run tabloid Global Times noted that “broadly speaking” the CAA “reflects the conflict between liberalism and nationalism. In India, the world's largest democracy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has embarked on a path of nationalism. He tries to achieve a unified national recognition via the idea of having one country, one nation, one religion and one language and eradicate diversification and fragmentation in India's society and culture”.

It added that the “rise of Hindu nationalism has broader implications for international politics…Hindu nationalism will not be satisfied to be only the dominant force within India. It will push the country to pursue higher international status - from permanent membership in the UN Security Council to dominance in the Indian Ocean and South Asia and eventually a major world power - to satisfy the need for victory and reputation”.

The daily further noted that the CAA will have a major “spillover effect” on the Hindu minorities in the region. “At the regional level, conflicts are likely to emerge between India and neighbouring countries, especially those having a Hindu population. India cannot move all Hindus to India and the issue of protection of foreign Hindus may arise.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/po6z0d/article26513873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THRDCHINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-fears-caa-could-have-repercussions-in-xinjiang/article30557311.ece
16,2020/01/13,Lahore High Court reserves verdict on Musharraf’s petition against conviction for high treason,"The Lahore High Court on Monday reserved its verdict on a set of petitions filed by Pakistan’s former military dictator General (retd) Pervez Musharraf, who has been sentenced to death for high treason.

A special court of Islamabad on December 17 last year handed down the death penalty to the 74-year-old Musharraf after six years of hearing the high-profile treason case against him. The case was filed by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government in 2013.

In his petition, Musharraf has asked the Lahore High Court (LHC) to set aside the special court’s verdict for being illegal, without jurisdiction and unconstitutional, while also seeking suspension of the verdict till a decision on his petition was made.

The LHC on Monday reserved its verdict on a set of petitions filed by Musharraf challenging multiple actions against him, including his conviction for high treason, the establishment of the trial court that convicted him and filing of the original high treason inquiry against him by the government, the Dawn newspaper reported.

The verdict is expected to be announced later on Monday, it quoted Musharraf’s counsel Azhar Siddique as saying.

A three-member full bench of the LHC comprising Justice Syed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi, Justice Mohammad Ameer Bhatti and Justice Chaudhry Masood Jahangir took tup the former president’s petitions last week.

On Friday, Justice Naqvi asked the federal government to submit a summary on the formation of the special court and had directed the State’s lawyer to present arguments on Monday, the report said.

As the court resumed hearing Musharraf’s pleas on Monday, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Ishtiaq A. Khan, appearing on behalf of the federal government, presented the order and record of the formation of the special court.

Mr. Khan said that the matter of forming a case against Musharraf was never included in the Cabinet agenda.

“It is the truth that the formation of the special court to hear the case against Musharraf was done without Cabinet approval,” Justice Jahangir was quoted as saying in the report.

During the hearing on Friday, the LHC had posed questions regarding the legality of the treason case and the formation of the special court that conducted the trial and had handed Musharraf the death sentence.

“This was history’s most important matter; can the cabinet discuss it without it being an agenda item?” the bench had asked.

Musharraf ruled Pakistan from 1999 to 2008 and lives in Dubai in self-imposed exile. The PML-N government had filed the treason case against the former army chief in 2013 over the imposition of an extra-constitutional emergency in November 2007, which led to the confinement of a number of superior court judges in their houses and sacking of over 100 judges.

In August 2008, he finally resigned in the face of impeachment proceedings by the new governing coalition, going into exile until his ill-starred homecoming in 2013, exiling himself once more three years later.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/hyru85/article30331236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Musharraf,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lahore-high-court-reserves-verdict-on-musharrafs-petition-against-conviction-for-high-treason/article30557125.ece
17,2020/01/13,"Severe weather in Afghanistan, Pakistan leaves 43 dead","Severe winter weather has struck parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan, with heavy snowfall, rains and flash floods that left at least 43 dead, officials said Monday as authorities struggled to clear and reopen highways and evacuate people to safer places.

In Pakistan, where 25 people were reported killed, much of the damage struck southwestern Baluchistan province. Imran Zarkon, chief of provincial disaster management, said 14 died there in the past 24 hours, mainly when roofs collapsed amid heavy snowfall.

In Afghanistan, at least 18 people, including women and children, died on account of the severe weather, according to provincial officials. Hasibullah Shaikhani, a press officer with the state ministry for disaster management, said most of the highways in Afghanistan were closed due to heavy snowfall and fears of avalanches.

Of the Afghan casualties, eight people were killed in southern Kandahar province, said Bahir Ahamdi, spokesman for the provincial governor.

19,2020/01/13,Australia may list Koalas as ‘endangered’ after population suffers ‘extraordinary hit’ in bushfire,"The Australian government on Monday said it could declare Koalas as an “endangered” species after their population suffered “extraordinary hit” in the bushfire crisis, which destroyed 30% of their habitat across the country.

Since September last year, the raging Australian bushfires, one of the worst in its history, has killed at least 26 people, burned over 10 million hectares of land, destroyed over 2,000 homes and pushed many species towards extinction.

Over 1.25 billion animals are believed to be dead in the wake of bushfires and experts believe that hundreds of billions of insects may have been wiped out, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported.

Also read: Why are bushfires raging in Australia?

The government has established a 50-million Australian dollar emergency fund to address the devastating loss of wildlife.

Announcing the funding commitment, Environment Minister Sussan Ley said Australia’s koala population has taken an “extraordinary hit” in the ongoing bushfires and could be listed as “endangered”.

The Threatened Species Scientific Committee will need to assess whether koalas have moved from a ‘vulnerable’ listing to being ‘endangered’ in some parts of the country, she said.

Koala populations across the country are not all impacted by the fires. Koalas are listed as vulnerable in northern New South Wales (NSW) and south-east Queensland, and the fires have likely put them under more pressure there, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.

The bushfires this summer season has destroyed over 10 million hectares of land across the country, while over 8.4 million hectares have been destroyed in NSW alone.

With 30% of their habitat already been destroyed in the devastating bushfires, koalas — the herbivorous marsupial animal native to Australia — have become a big focus for the Australian government.

“We know that our native flora and fauna have been very badly damaged. It will be some time before we know what that means for their numbers (and) koalas will be a big area of focus for us,” Environment Minister Ley said.

“It may be necessary...to see whether in certain parts of the country, koalas move from where they are, which is often vulnerable, up to endangered,” she said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/t6dgsu/article30555802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRESTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australia-may-list-koalas-as-endangered-after-population-suffers-extraordinary-hit-in-bushfire/article30555804.ece
20,2020/01/13,"Rain, snowfall wreak havoc in Pakistan, claim 14 lives in Balochistan","Heavy snowfall and incessant rain have left at least 14 people, including women and children, dead and over a dozen injured in several parts of Balochistan, Pakistan’s largest province, a media report said on Monday.

The inclement weather has affected road and air traffic and disconnected Balochistan with rest of the world.

Continuous snowfall in the provincial capital Quetta has led to the collapse of a large number of mud houses, claiming lives in the border towns of Chaman, Barshor and Bostan area of Pishin district.

Six people, including three women and as many children, died and two others were injured when the roof of their house collapsed in Shahabzai area of Zhob district due to heavy snowfall, the Dawn newspaper reported.

In Killi Luqman area near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Chaman, five members of a family, including women and children, died and six others were injured when the roof of their mud house collapsed during an engagement ceremony late on Sunday.

Two children died and as many suffered injuries when the roof of their room caved-in in Killi Chukal area of Pishin district, while another woman lost her life in a similar incident, the report quoted Met officials as saying.

Sources in Civil Hospital Quetta said that over a dozen people injured in snowfall-related accidents were brought to the hospital for treatment.

The Met officials said the heavy snowfall in Quetta had already broken the 20-year-old record.

“In Qilla Saifullah, the Met Office recorded three to four feet snow, which was more than double the usual 1.5 feet snow,” said Chief Meteorologist Azmat Hayat Khan.

An aircraft that had arrived from Saudi Arabia with passengers on Saturday night could not fly back, as Quetta airport runway remained covered with heavy snow, sources said.

Hundreds of passengers were stranded on different highways linking Balochistan. Official said traffic was also suspended at Quetta-Chaman highway as the Khozak-Pass linking Pakistan with Afghanistan also received heavy snowfall, bringing to halt the Afghan transit trade with hundreds of trucks and other goods vehicles remaining standard on both sides of the border.

“Several people with their vehicles are still waiting for help but unfortunately those areas cannot be reached without helicopter. I have made a request for provision of the helicopter to the provincial disaster management authority. Hopefully, it would be provided to us as soon as possible,” said Chagai Deputy Commissioner Fateh Khan Khajjak.

Around two dozen passengers, including women and children, remain trapped in the far-flung Kaachar area close to Pakistan-Iran border. Official said the army and the personnel of Frontier Corps were making efforts to rescue them.

The regional transport authorities and deputy commissioners of various districts have warned people against travelling on the Quetta-Karachi highway. They said the roads were blocked at various points due to heavy snowfall in Kalat, Mastung, Surab, Zehri and many other areas.

The new spell of heavy snowfall that started on Saturday night in Quetta continued with small intervals in many other areas of northern Balochistan, according to the Met Office.

Water level in the Dashat and Nehag rivers as well as other small rivers has risen after their catchment areas received heavy showers.

“There is no sign of danger,” senior official of the irrigation department Sher Jan Baloch said.

Snowfall is also expected in different parts of the country, besides heavy showers in Islamabad from Monday till Tuesday morning, according to the meteorological department.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/74dx98/article30555672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTAN-WEATHER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rain-snowfall-wreak-havoc-in-pakistan-claim-14-lives-in-balochistan/article30555673.ece
21,2020/01/13,Ex-pope Benedict rejects opening up priesthood to married men,"Former pope Benedict XVI has publicly urged his successor Pope Francis not to open the Catholic priesthood up to married men, in a plea that Sunday stunned Vatican experts.

The ex-pontiff, who retired in 2013, issued the defence of clerical celibacy in a book written with arch-conservative Cardinal Robert Sarah, extracts of which were published in exclusive by France's Le Figaro.

""I cannot keep silent!"" Benedict wrote in the book, which follows an extraordinary meeting of bishops from the Amazonian at the Vatican last year that recommended the ordination of married men in certain circumstances.

The pope emeritus, 92, and Sarah from Guinea weighed in on the controversial question of whether or not to allow ""viri probati"" -- married ""men of proven virtue"" -- to join the priesthood.

Pope Francis is currently considering allowing it in remote locations, such as the Amazon, where communities seldom have Mass due to a lack of priests, and is expected to publish his decision in the coming weeks.

The pair asked the whole Church not to be ""swayed"" by ""bad pleas, theatrics, diabolical lies, fashionable errors that want to devalue priestly celibacy"".

""It is urgent, necessary, that everyone, bishops, priests and laity, let themselves be guided once more by faith as they look upon the Church and on priestly celibacy that protects her mystery,"" they wrote.

They warned of priests ""confused by the incessant questioning of their consecrated celibacy"".

""The conjugal state concerns man in his totality, and since the service of the Lord also requires the total gift of man, it does not seem possible to realise the two vocations simultaneously,"" Benedict wrote.

Cardinal Sarah insisted that while celibacy can be ""a trial"" it is also ""a liberation"".

'Serious breach'

Pope emeritus Benedict, who was the first pontiff to resign in almost 600 years, at first withdrew to a life of quiet contemplation in the Vatican, but has increasingly begun to speak out on key Catholic issues.

He and Cardinal Sarah insisted their plea was not a ""political manoeuvre"" or ""power game"".

But Vatican experts expressed astonishment that the retired pope would speak out on such a sensitive topic.

""Benedict XVI is really not breaking his silence because he (and his entourage) never felt bound to that promise. But this is a serious breach,"" Massimo Faggioli, who writes for La Croix, said on Twitter.

Joshua McElwee of the National Catholic Reporter, tweeted that ""a former pope speaking in public about something his successor is currently in the process of considering"" was ""incredible"".

While Vatican expert Iacopo Scaramuzzi pointed out that ""cohabitation (in the Vatican) is difficult if the emeritus pope does not respect his own promise to hide away and obey"".

The idea of filling empty pulpits in remote locations by allowing married men to become priests is a divisive once, with critics warning the emotive issue could fracture the Catholic Church.

Supporters say it would not be necessary to rewrite Church law; Francis could simply make an exemption to the rules -- like the one already granted to married Anglican pastors who later converted to Catholicism.

But the ultra-conservative wing of the Church -- particularly in Europe and North America -- has spoken out strongly against the idea, warning that making exceptions could pave the way to the abolition of celibacy globally.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kmqb8v/article30554908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POPE-BENEDICTBOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ex-pope-benedict-rejects-opening-up-priesthood-to-married-men/article30554909.ece

23,2020/01/13,Shringla calls on Trump at Oval Office before leaving for India,"Outgoing Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Harsh Vardhan Shringla called on President Donald Trump at the Oval Office of the White House before leaving the country and thanked him for strengthening the Indian-American relationship.

It is probably for the first time that a U.S. President has met an outgoing Indian Ambassador, which experts say is reflection of the significance Mr. Trump attaches to the India-US partnership.

“Amb Harsh Shringla, who is proceeding to New Delhi to take up his assignment as Foreign Secretary, called on Trump at Oval Office of the White House and thanked him for his steadfast support for strengthening the India-US strategic partnership,” the Indian Embassy in Washington DC said in a tweet on Sunday.

Mr. Shringla (57), is scheduled to take up the next assignment as India’s Foreign Secretary on January 29.

Mr. Shringla, who arrived in the U.S. on January 9, 2019, and presented his credentials to Mr. Trump at the White House two days later on January 11, played a key role in bringing the India-US relationship back on track, especially in the second half of the year.

“I give Harsh Shringla great credit for his tireless pursuit in taking the India-US relations to a new dimension by prudently navigating the highly partisan and complicated U.S. political arena called the US Congress. That’s what I would call a real Champion Diplomat,” New York-based Al Mason, who is an expert on global real estate investment and education, said after attending the farewell that Mr. Shringla hosted at his India House on Friday.

“He has been one of the most charismatic, persuasive and result-oriented diplomat representing India in the US. He has spent each hour of his tenure in pursuit of building the most solid bridge between India and the US,” Mr. Mason said.

Before taking Dubai-bound Emirates flight from the Dallas International airport Sunday morning, Shringla tweeted, “A final goodbye”, along with his pictures, one in the lawns of India House — the official residence — and another at the entrance of the Indian Embassy in downtown Washington DC.

“All the best to my colleague,” tweeted Emily Haber, the German Ambassador to the US.

In a lighter tone, she said her counterpart in New Delhi, Walter J Lindner, “is looking forward to meeting you and to giving you a ride in his bright red Hindustan Ambassador!”. Haber posted a picture of the Red Ambassador too.

“Dare say this red Ambassador looks better than the iconic Volkswagen Beatle,” commented India’s Deputy Ambassador to the U.S. Amit Kumar.

“Bon Voyage & best wishes to Amb Shringla as he moves to Delhi for his next imp (ortant) assignment. It has been a privilege to work closely with him these past few months to advance & consolidate the India-US Strategic Partnership,” Kumar tweeted. “Bitter sweet moments in Washington this evening wishing. Ambassador Shringla adieu from the US but knowing that he will be shepherding us from Delhi,” tweeted Sandeep Chakravorty, the Indian Consul General in New York.

Envoys of several diplomatic missions, including those from neighbouring nations and African countries, had attended Shringla’s farewell, reflecting his popularity in the Washington’s diplomatic community.

Before leaving the country, Mr. Shringla met top U.S. Congressional leaders, including House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and thanked him “for his understanding and support” of India-US relations. He also called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“Saying farewell isn’t easy, especially when it’s to a valued partner & friend,” tweeted Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice G Wells. “It’s been a pleasure working with you to make US India relationship the strongest it’s ever been. Congrats on FS appointment & looking forward to continuing our partnership,” she said on the eve of Mr. Shringla’s departure.

24,2020/01/13,Lava gushes from Philippine volcano as ash spreads to Manila,"A volcano near Manila spewed a massive cloud of ash that drifted across the Philippine capital on Sunday, forcing the cancellation of flights and closure of schools and government offices as authorities warned of a possible “explosive eruption”.

Thousands of people were evacuated from the area near Taal volcano after it suddenly shot a column of ash and steam as high as 15 km into the sky. Lightning crackled inside the smoke and tremors shook the ground.

Taal, one of the world's smallest active volcanoes, sits in the middle of a lake about 70 km south of the centre of the capital, Manila. Authorities said there was a risk that an eruption could cause a tsunami in the lake.

“Taal is a very small volcano, but a dangerous volcano,” Renato Solidum, head of The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), told Reuters. “It is unique because it is a volcano within a volcano.”

The institute raised the danger level posed by the volcano to 4 out of a possible 5 - meaning “hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days.”

The Philippines lies on the “Ring of Fire,” a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes.

One of the most active volcanoes in the Philippines, Taal has erupted more than 30 times in the past five centuries, most recently in 1977. An eruption in 1911 killed 1,500 people and one in 1754 lasted for a few months.

“That is the worst case scenario,” Mr. Solidum said.

Thousands evacuated

About 8,000 residents of the volcano island and other high-risk towns were being evacuated, with about 6,000 already out of the danger zone by Sunday evening, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council told reporters.

The volcano and its surroundings are a popular weekend getaway from Manila.

The drifting ash forced the cancellation of 172 flights in and out of the international airport on Sunday. General Manager Ed Monreal said flights would also be suspended on Monday because there was ash on the runway.

President Rodrigo Duterte's office ordered the suspension of government work in the capital and of all school classes in Manila and other areas affected by the ash. A statement advised private companies to follow suit.

In Manila, long queues formed in shops selling face masks as health officials warned of possible breathing problems for people with respiratory ailments and urged the public to stay indoors and use dust masks when going out.

“When I went to my car to bring my groceries, I saw it was covered in ash. So I hurriedly went back inside to buy a mask from a drugstore but they had run out,” said Angel Bautista, 41, a resident of Paranaque city, south of the capital.

Taal's ash plume was clearly visible from the city of Tagaytay, a well-frequented viewing spot for the volcano.

“We were having lunch when we heard rumbling. We saw the volcano erupting. It rained and some small pebbles fell to the ground,” Jon Patrick Yen, a restaurant customer in Tagaytay, told Reuters.

“I did not expect to see such spectacle. We just went by to eat.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4tcg45/article30554847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN13PHILIPPINESVOLCANO1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/volcano-spews-ash-over-manila/article30554679.ece
25,2020/01/13,"12 shot, five dead, in single day of shootings in Baltimore","Authorities say 12 people were shot, five of them fatally, in eight separate weekend shootings in Baltimore.

The first of Saturday’s shootings was reported at about 2:30 a.m. and involved three female victims, all found with apparent gunshot wounds in a car in a northeastern section of the city. One victim, a 28-year-old woman, died shortly after arriving at a hospital.

A few hours later, police responding to a shooting in southeast Baltimore found a 46-year-old man with a gunshot wound to the leg. Then, a second shooting victim, a 40-year-old man, walked into a hospital seeking treatment for a gunshot wound to his leg.

Shortly after 2:30 p.m. Saturday, police found a man fatally shot in southeast Baltimore. That was followed less than half an hour later by a shooting in central Baltimore that left a 37-year-old man wounded.

A 38-year-old man was found with a gunshot wound around 7 p.m. Saturday in northeast Baltimore.

A shooting in southwest Baltimore about an hour later left one man wounded and another dead. More gunfire a few minutes later in northeast Baltimore left a 37-year-old man fatally wounded.

Saturday’s violence ended shortly before 11 p.m., when officers found a 24-year-old man fatally wounded in northwest Baltimore.

The city recorded 348 homicides last year, its fifth consecutive year with more than 300 murders and the most violent year ever on a per-capita basis.

City council president Brandon Scott, a Democrat running for mayor, issued a statement Sunday condemning the violence.

“A day that should have been met with pride and community was once again flooded with violence and loss,” Scott wrote, an apparent reference to an NFL divisional playoff game hosted by the Baltimore Ravens on Saturday night.

“This violence is heartbreaking and must stop now,” added Scott, who said he plans to question Baltimore’s police commissioner and other agency heads about what they were doing in the affected communities before and after the shootings.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/12-shot-five-dead-in-single-day-of-shootings-in-baltimore/article30554675.ece
26,2020/01/13,Niger government revises toll of jihadist attack to 89,"A jihadist attack on a military camp in western Niger on January 9 left 89 soldiers dead, according to a new toll announced by the government on public radio on January 12.

“After a thorough search, the toll has been established as 89 dead among friendly forces, and 77 dead for the enemy,” said spokesman Zakaria Abdourahame.

The previous toll given for the attack on the Chinegodar camp on January 9 was 25 soldiers killed.

Three days of national mourning have been declared to honour the dead.

Heavily armed assailants had stormed the military base in an area where dozens also died in a previous jihadist attack.

The raid near to the volatile frontier with Mali was carried out by attackers in vehicles and on motorbikes.

The attack happened in the same region Tillaberi, also bordering Burkina Faso, where 71 Niger soldiers were killed in a December attack, claimed by the Islamic State group, that saw hundreds of jihadists storm a camp near the border with Mali with artillery.

The latest attack is the deadliest on Niger's military since Islamist extremist violence began to spill over from neighbouring Mali in 2015.

The December attack spurred leaders of the G5 Sahel nations to call for closer cooperation and international support in the battle against the Islamist threat.

Militant violence has spread across the vast Sahel region, especially in Burkina Faso and Niger, having started when armed Islamists revolted in northern Mali in 2012.

Thousands of civilians have also died and more than a million have been forced to flee their homes since the jihadist revolt began.

Analysts note an escalation in the jihadists' operational tactics, which seem to have become bolder and more complex in recent months.

Ranged against them are the impoverished armies of Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, plus a 4,500-man French force in the Sahel and the 13,000-man UN force in Mali, MINUSMA.

27,2020/01/13,I am an artist in service of the story: Sobhita Dhulipala,"Seven years ago one may have been forgiven for thinking of Sobhita Dhulipala as the geeky student. Today she is an established actress who has successfully worked her roles as the ambitious Tara Khanna in Made In Heaven, Smrutika Naidu in Raman Raghav 2.0 and Isha Khanna in Bard of Blood.

The actress is now a part of Ghost Stories, an anthology of films directed by Zoya Akhtar, Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee and Karan Johar.

Sobhita is in Anurag’s film. She plays Neha a paranoid pregnant woman who miscarries her baby. “This is my second release with Netflix, after Bard of Blood. I was overcome by the story from the moment I read it. It is a very sensitive subject and I surrendered to it,” says Sobhita who admits it was quite an unnerving experience.

Growing up... “Visakhapatnam is where I grew up. My parents live here. A student of Visakha Valley Sobhita says she had a simple upbringing that she says has been a huge influence on her thinking. “ I have very fond memories of this city. I’m very connected to my roots, culturally and demographically.”

“I can’t help but get affected by the surroundings and situation. I’m very emotional as a person. It wasn’t just about the horror or thriller, for me it was also about the trauma . I’m very willing to submit to the writer’s words and world. I always have been. Besides, working with Anurag is always a delight.”

This is not the first time, Sobhita teamed up with Anurag Kashyap. She made her acting debut in his psychological-thriller Raman Raghav 2.0 that also had Nawazuddin Siddique and Vicky Kaushal.

The movie that was a commercial success was premièred in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

The year gone by

In the last one year, Sobhita had two major releases on online streaming platforms— Made in Heaven and Bard of the Blood. “It’s been a very interesting year, most definitely. All the projects that I shot for in the last two years released and it was quite a relief to see them takeshape ..” she says.

She catapulted to fame after Made in Heaven, which garnered praise for dealing with the sensitive subject of homosexuality. “I had auditioned for the role of Tara and was quite thrilled when I landed it,” says Sobhita though she says when it comes to business, she has no idea of what does well and what doesn’t.

“I am an artist in service of the story, I like to focus on that. If I think much about the outcome, it inhibits me from taking risks,” says the 27-year-old actress.

Looking back, Sobhita reflects that acting was never on cards while growing up. “At the end of college I took part in a Miss India and won the title. I followed it up with modelling and then many auditions and learnings later, I was called in for my first film audition. I knew that acting was my calling. I ended up getting the part, which became my first film - Raman Raghav 2.0,” she says.

The actress is currently wrapping up her schedule for her Kurup which stars Dulquer Salman. She made her debut in Malayalam industry in 2019 with Moothon. The bilingual film was also released in Hindi. “After Kurup, I will begin shooting with the production house RSVP on an exciting Telugu film and then jump into Made in Heaven season 2 shoot,” she adds.

28,2020/01/13,Decoding YouTube channel Ungal Meenavan Mookaiyur’s success,"He is K Kingston, an Internet influencer in his own way.

This fisherman’s videos on his adventures at sea are viewed routinely by lakhs of people. Kingston’s cybersea adventures off the coast of Kadaladi, Ramanathapuram district, began with his TikTok videos, which he did “for a bit of popularity”. He tried different hacks, but hit the viral league with a song from Dhanush’s Maryan. As ‘Komban sura’ played in the background, a camera showed him catching a chinna sura (small shark) weighing a kilogram. The video got 10 lakh likes, as viewers were ensnared by the blue background. That was 14 months ago.

Then, Kingston decided to do more. He made live videos of his sea expeditions. “They looked interesting to me,” says the 30-year-old. One of his videos, of a star-fish, went viral. Most people said they saw a star-fish for the first time, while others wondered if it was a plastic specimen. “The next time, I made sure it acted alive, and shot all its movements,” he adds. The star-fish episode was a landmark: from then on, his videos would be guided by viewer suggestions.

Claim to fame

Kingston is proud of his conch shell video. It showed the live creature as his voice-over narrated its life-cycle. Viewers came back with questions, which he answered, and the follower count soon went up to five lakhs. “But it was not always ‘Hey, you’re great!’,” points out Kingston. “Some asked why I was killing fish, trolls called me a killer.” But Kingston answered them all patiently. In one post, he said, “Fishermen look after fish like they are his children.”

Appreciation across cyberspace was like oxygen for him. “I felt the pats,” he says. Some viewers suggested that he put his videos out on YouTube too. He asked a friend to create an e-mail ID for him. Kingston’s first YouTube video brought in 20,000 subscribers in a day (he’d added one lakh subscribers in 20 days). “I redid the conch shell video, and showed how to make meen kozhambu with freshly-caught fish,” he explains. The video got one million views.

YouTubing is now serious work for him. Kingston has upgraded his mobile phone, and his audience watch snippets on swimming strokes, dangers at sea, and the endless variety of sea-creatures. A techie friend in Chennai helped set up his YouTube channel four months ago. Soon, revenue from advertisements started trickling in. He is now saving for an underwater camera to improve production quality.

When, recently, he heard that his videos were being used without permission in social media, he was alarmed. Some even called him “fake”. “I had to prove I was the producer and show copyright,” he says, adding that he messaged those who lifted his content. “I told them that I never stole anyone’s work. I struggle to make my videos. Take mine if you need it badly, but don’t claim ownership... don’t say I’m fake,” he says. His brother now monitors the videos and proves authenticity through time-lapse.

Fishing for ideas

Kingston’s videos are educational too. One shows how clouds absorb water vapour from the sea. Most of his audience applauded his guts for showing the phenomenon up close, but others rubbished it.

All in the family Kingston’s YouTubing, like his fishing, is a family affair.

He shoots, edits, comments and adds titles during up-and-down fishing journeys. His brothers run the boat. He makes six videos a day, only so that his viewers “don’t get bored.” His diversified output includes cookery lessons and Q&A sessions. He has answered queries like, ‘Have you seen mermaids? Can you pass on their names?’ But once back home, he ensures that he spends time with his two young daughters.

“A tornado in the making,” a viewer commented under the video. But Kingston was unfazed. “I knew I was right. The elders in my colony supported it but I had no scientific proof. A YouTube channel telecast the video, and a meteorologist authenticated my claim. I proved experience gives us bigger lessons than mere book-learning,” he says.

The highlight in his videos is the complete absence of malice, and the patience with which he explains phenomena. “Let’s exchange views, nanba (friend),” he says. “Come, taste my fish fries.”

He believes he is changing the unsavoury perception people have of fishermen. “We are branded rowdies and smugglers. But we’re engaged in a traditional craft; we battle waves. Now viewers say, ‘Fishermen are great... when we go to buy fish, we don’t haggle.’”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/i8vi2c/article30557599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07mpFisherman1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/caught-in-the-web/article30557600.ece
29,2020/01/13,Citizens speak about the change they would want to see this Bhogi,"It is that time of the year when we symbolically burn the old to ring in the new. Celebrated across Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, Bhogi which precedes Makara Sankranti, Pongal, Magh Bihu, Sakraat, Poush Sankranti, Uttarayan and Lohri by different communities across the country is an opportunityto change for a better, happier tomorrow.

In the Telugu states, Bhogi mantalu, the traditional bonfire lit at the dawn of the festive Bhogi day is a metaphor to look within and burn the negativity in us. A colleague from Assam shares the custom in their community, “We too light a bonfire, and put the iron kadhais used in our kitchen. The kadhais come out clean and serve as a reminder of the possibilities of what we can be without those impure thoughts and unpleasant things.”

The practice might be slightly different, but the significance remains more or less the same: discard anger and negativity and emerge refreshed. Let this essence of Bhogi prevail among us.

More awareness on healthy food

Three things I hope will transform society. More awareness on the food we consume. Our diseases are predominantly because of the unhealthy food we eat. More people should take up vegetable gardening and at least grow leafy vegetables at home. I have spoken earlier about taking up farming and I want to be implement it this year. I plan to take up sustainable agriculture at my farm in Chevella. We should realise that we can do anything in our lives and jobs only if we are healthy. We need to talk more about it.

I would also like to see a change in our time spent on social media. We need to be creators, not imitators. Social media is like a mango pickle; it can be an accompaniment to the food but not always the main dish. Social media is just a part of life and should not become the whole life. We need to focus on having real relationships. Manishi ni manishi tone kalavaali, mobile to kaadu. Only then, we can experience real emotions.

Finally, I would want people to have an appreciative mindset. Instead of constantly criticising and complaining about our own lives and others’, let’s learn to be grateful and appreciate. If I had spent my time only criticising others, I wouldn’t have been in a position that I am today.

Bring changes in women’s lives

I am reminded of Sankranti celebrations in my hometown in Godavarikhani. We used to draw big muggulu, keep gobbemmalu on them and have a muggula poti. Sankranti, the harvest festival is for the farmer. If the farmer is happy only then we can be happy. The one change I hope for is in women’s lives. On one hand, we worship women as goddesses and on the other, commit atrocities against them. Since decades the situation has not changed. I hope to see a day when we women can walk independently without any fear or any pepper spray or knife in the bags. We are in 2020, yet women cannot go out on their own after 10 pm and need a brother/husband/father as escort.

It is impossible and foolish to think there will be a big transformation in society. I hope people make small changes in their own families. These small changes will bring in a positive impact.

Refine the self

We spend Sankranti in Venkat’s (husband Venkat Siddareddy’s) village. The atmosphere is of joy and everyone comes together to celebrate the harvest. I learned to make kites and milk a cow from my mother-in-law. At the crack of dawn , we assemble to build a huge Bhogi fire of waste that is mostly made of dried Thaati tree fronds, dry twigs and leaves. It is a reminder to look within and discard what is negative and embrace with open arms, that which is positive. It is a time to celebrate and look within to clear up junk. We do a systematic cleansing of our homes, periodically discard what is excess in our phones. So why not ourselves, too ?

Festivals are reminders in the iconography that they carry. Bhogi is one such. I am flawed, but the intent to refine the self is earnest. Bhogi and other festivals help bring about that change and are a pitstop to pause, collect, discard , reset and find better versions of our self. To quote Kabir Bura jo dekhan main chalaa buro na miliya koi Jo dil dekha aapna mujhse bura na koi. It insists on looking within to find what is negative and discard that. One can refine the self by reading and ruminating on the words of great saints who have left us messages in their songs. Thyagaraja (Manasu nilpa shakti leka pote) Bharatiyar (Manadirkku kattalai siddar paadalgal and Tiruppugazh). Their words reinforce in us a quality of being centred. I often pore over these texts. In music too, one can apply this thought at every note level. All these things are so easy to say but difficult to follow. The refinement of the self is multi-fold. To look inward and cleanse is a big step and takes constant re-evaluation. Bhogi helps us set this tone in place. The outwardly acts like cleaning the home are akin to the process that goes on within. The sync is unmissable!

Create your own identity

Weekends are the time to have fun, but I see some youngsters in a weekend mode even in the middle of the week! One can have fun but also focus on hard work. One cannot rely completely on parents and grandparents. Instead of becoming lazy and only counting on what is already there, one should aim to do something on their own. It is not just about earning money, work helps to create our own identity. One should be hungry to know and work. Instead of taking wealth from parents, how about bringing name and fame to them through our endeavours?

I also want to see a change in our attitude towards tradition. We can be modern in outlook but respect and be aware of our traditions.

Let’s fire the ‘Ignorance of Art’

We should place the ‘ignorance' of art’ on fire. In contemporary society, we are not able to embrace the creative arts, especially visual arts. If an appreciation for creative art prevails, art will be in good hands and with art lovers who cherish it. I wish to see that art is not ignored, rather it needs to be appreciated, embraced and given importance right from one’s primary education.

This Bhogi, let us welcome a sensible society which encourages, enjoys and appreciates arts. Art is not as much appreciated as automobiles and electronics in contemporary Indian society. On the contrary, the West and East (China) have brought many museums into existence to create arts awareness so that they preserve, appreciate and make art available for future generations.

30,2020/01/13,The bulls of Alanganallur,"Vellaiyyan doesn’t like me. He lowers his head, flares his nostrils, and shoots out a spurt of air like a bullet, pawing the ground.

This jallikattu bull in Alanganallur village, 16 kilometres from Madurai, is the angriest of them all. Dull white with sharp horns, flesh at his chest falling in folds like chiffon, the country bull is tied at his owner T Kumar’s yard. M Sakthivel, a jallikattu champion, stands a safe distance from Vellaiyyan. “He won’t let anyone but a select few near him,” he says.

There is a sense of urgency at Alanganallur: young men scuttle about, shops sell colourful belts fitted with bells for cattle, fresh kolams are up at households: it is time.

This village is famous for the bull-taming event held on the third day of Pongal festivities every year, which attracts tourists from across the globe. At this time of the year, the village, with just a handful of streets and around 3,000 households, transforms into an arena with make-shift galleries for thousands of people, and cameras.

As the big day approaches, bull tamers who double up as bull caretakers, are on high alert.

Sakthivel is checking on Vellaiyyan and Marai, the two bulls he tends to through the year. “He had his first meal at around 11 am today,” says the 24-year-old. It comprised cotton seeds, sesame seed oil cakes, toor dal dust, and wheat dust mixed with water. “This fellow also likes some salt with his food,” chips in 22-year-old M Raja, another tamer who assists in Vellaiyyan’s caretaking. “We add some to his two meals — his second meal is at 7 pm.” Standing between them, the bull munches on straw and there is water available at his asking.

All set to run

A month close to jallikattu, portions become smaller. “We deduct wheat dust since it makes the bull feel heavy,” points out Sakthivel. “This tones the muscles and he becomes more agile.” Vellayyian’s trademark move as soon as he is set free from the vadivasal (entry point in front of which tamers wait at the ready) is to leap in the air. “This makes it impossible for people to grab him,” he adds.

Sakthivel is a local hero. He ‘caught’ — a term people here use to tame a bull — six bulls at Alanganallur, seven at Coimbatore, and six at the Tirupur jallikattu last year. Leading us towards Ramu, another bull he helps maintain, he says, “I look up to my seniors, they taught me the moves and techniques.” He leads a disciplined life. “I abstain from meat and alcohol for a one month before jallikattu,” he says, adding, “To us, these bulls are like gods.”

Some tamers put together money to set up a gym in their neighbourhood, so they can work out through the year. Gym hours increase as jallikattu arrives. “I run in a ground nearby every morning and also go for a swim in a lake,” says Sakthivel. The bulls too get their share of exercise.

AP Saravanan, who owns Ramu, a calm and composed bull, bathes him twice a week — on Tuesdays and Sundays — as Pongal nears. But a bath in the pond, serves a larger purpose. The men let the bulls swim to exercise their leg muscles. This is a crucial part of the animal’s workout.

Ramu is getting his Sunday morning bath today. A Raja, a specialist, has been called to inspect the bull’s grey horns, which have a tapering white end. Bulls have the tendency to grind their horns into mud, and hence their horns usually suffer wear and tear. Raja douses them with plenty of castor oil. “It has a cooling effect,” he tells us, rubbing it all the way down to the head.

Saravanan then leads Ramu with a red rope to a pond nearby. In the early morning light, on the dirt road with thorny karuvelam trees on either side, the two of them walk side-by-side, Ramu’s girthy hump bobbing up and down as he marches on. A few more boys join in as Saravanan gently eases the bull into the water. After a few ungainly steps, the animal floats gracefully, holding his head above the surface of the water. “Paathu, paathu (Careful, careful),” says Saravanan.

His grip on the rope tight, Saravanan swims ahead of Ramu, who follows him, eyes half-shut. This routine continues for 20 minutes, after which the two of them come to the bank. “He’s starting to pant,” says Saravanan, “Enough swimming for the day.” Now, it’s time for Ramu’s bath. It takes four men, 10 shampoo sachets, and a large tuft of straw, to scrub him clean. He stands patiently as they work foam into his back, visibly relaxed.

“We bathe the bulls on all three days starting from Pongal,” says Sakthivel, walking with Saravanan and his bull towards a temple, where the bull will get sandalwood paste applied on his face, horns, and body. “On jallikattu day, we put new, colourful ropes around their necks. They get new bells, a rose garland...” he smiles. “You should see them lunge out of the vadivasal shaking their bodies, sending rose petals flying.”

Saravanan believes in listening to his animal. On the morning of the festival, despite all the training through the year, if Ramu does not yield when he pulls his rope, Saravanan announces that his bull will not be participating. Says Saravanan, “His word is final.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/x74mlb/article30557527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MPALANGANALLURBULLS3,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-bulls-of-alanganallur/article30557532.ece
31,2020/01/13,How WeWork Hyderabad encourages holistic rearing through spatial design,"Frankly speaking, the hype around WeWork India was unreal when they finally opened in Hyderabad with not one working space but two. And many people who kept an eye on WeWork’s financial trouble out west were sceptical at how it would fare in India. But it is worth pointing out that WeWork in India is a joint brainchild between the We Company — which owns the WeWork brand — and Indian real estate company Embassy group.

According to a November 2019 interview with The Hindu Business Line, Karan Virwani, CWeO, WeWork India, said the absorption of commercial office spaces in India reached a peak in 2019 during a rise in the past five years. Plus there is the fact that WeWork claims to not be your traditional office space.

So does the Hyderabad offices live up to the aforementioned hype?

WeWork Hyderabad, Krishe Emerald

The estimated square footage for the 14-floor Krishe Emerald site in Kondapur is 2,55,852 square feet while the Rajapushpa site in Financial District is 1,91,560 square feet.

Spatial awareness is one of WeWork's pride points, internationally — whether one works in congested London or the fast developing Hyderabad… and naturally, design plays a huge role in this. The design for both buildings was led by Francois Gramoli, creative director, WeWork India with his team comprising designers Ramya Pillai for Krishe Emerald and Abhishek Semwal for Rajapushpa.

Another design USP is that, with close to 500 setups worldwide and almost 30 across India, WeWork aims to capture each city's ethos and cultural character in a given space. At Krishe Emerald the kalamkari tapestry that hangs above the social space catches the eye and the elements of wooden and metal accents in both furnishings and art break up the predicted monotony of most office spaces.

Mental health in the workplace is one of India’s most important discourses to be had and design plays a huge role in it. Francois has always been vocal about engendering positivity and productivity in equal measures through design. Communal spaces are kept open to drive connections and networking while glass partitions help inculcate a happily contagious feeling of activity and energy.

WeWork Hyderabad, Krishe Emerald

This makes sense given a majority of the companies and startups at WeWork Hyderabad are in the intense fintech and marketing industries.

So green

WeWork Hyderabad’s green mentality is not unlike that of most progressive working spaces in the city — and to power up buildings with more occupancy to the hundreds, the latest and most scalable policies are needed to pull that off.

In terms of electricity the building offers real time energy monitoring and also provides alerts to prevent energy wastage. The warmer-hued LED lighting are equipped with occupancy sensors to optimise lighting energy use, too. Then there is the more technical Modular UPS to optimise UPS loading.

The Building Management System (BMS)-based equipment scheduling prevents extra operating of equipment while there is also VAV & VFD for HVAC control and optimisation through the day and night. Climactic comfort comes in the form of optimum temperature set points for energy saving.

Then there are the more unique green initiatives. There are regular indoor Air Quality checks and the water faucets are geared with aerators in water for water conservation. Plus there is also waste stream segregation at the source. WeWork India also has a strict zero single-use plastic policy as well as composting on site for a few buildings and a chemical-free cleaning pilot.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fq37na/article30557438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy13WeWork2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-wework-hyderabad-encourages-holistic-rearing-through-spatial-design/article30557441.ece
32,2020/01/13,This year’s Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha will last a month and end at Pulicat Lake,"The car park of Washermanpet Metro is generally a drab concrete enclosure.

But two weeks back, it was transformed into a performance space; a powerful musical based on Subramania Bharati’s ‘Sakhiye Rowthiram Pazhagu’ played to a curious audience, promoting self defence against sexual violence. This was one of the many outreach events that gave a bird’s eye view of what Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha has in store for its sixth edition.

The festival has much to offer — from a Bharatanatyam performance set against the backdrop of Pulicat lake to artistes of African descent singing songs about how monkeys converse with people.

A month-long celebration of the often-ignored cultural threads that make the city what it is, Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha is a coast-to-coast examination of what the city’s artistic milieu has to offer, sans discrimination. This cultural amalgamation travels from Thiruvalluvar Nagar, a small colony situated near Elliot’s beach, to the less explored Pazhaverkadu.

The volunteer-led festival took shape as Urur Olcott Kuppam Vizha five years ago, a social and artistic gathering in unconventional spaces, targeted at communities who usually do not have access to such events. “In the second and third years, the focus was on the exchange of art forms and understanding the social identities of those who perform them,” says Ramya Rajaraman, a volunteer.

Last year, it transformed into Chennai Kala Theru Vizha, with North Chennai as the central focus. “In this edition, we built on that and created other narratives that should be included in such a mould,” says vocalist TM Krishna, who is also one of the volunteers. The curation follows the idea that every event should not only entertain but also educate.

Uniting communities

This edition also touches upon the timely aspect of uniting communities, which is why ‘The Rainbow Festival’ is one of the highlights. “In Thiruvalluvar Nagar, for instance, (at the Pongal Theru Vizha) we bring in the Siddis who trace their ancestry back to Africa,” continues Krishna.

The Siddis were brought to India as slaves by Portuguese merchants over 500 years ago. Their population in Karnataka today is 36,000. “We belong to Hindu, Muslim and Christian religions. But all of us have a shared identity of Damam, which is our cultural dance,” explains Juliana Pedro Fernandez Siddi, who will lead a group of 12 performers for the festival. “Damam is also a tool for self-expression among the community,” she adds.

The Rainbow Festival, or Thirunar Vizha, is a two-day event, where people from the LGBTQIA+ community, working in the field of arts, literature and filmmaking, come together in their 25th year of resistance. Renowned names such as artist Kalki Subramaniam, dancer Narthaki Nataraj and author A Revathi will be performing. In addition, P Abhijith, who has been actively documenting the trans movement in South India, will be conducting screenings. “All these will take place in a middle-class neighbourhood in Mylapore, in an effort to spread awareness,” says Krishna.

Tara Thirunangai Nadana Kuzhu, a group from North Chennai, will perform ‘Record Dance’. “They will perform to 1960s and 1970s Kollywood music. It has become a genre in itself, but nobody hears about them,” Krishna adds. Vellai Mozhi, a solo theatre performance by A Revathi, devised from her autobiography, The Truth About Me, will also be staged.

The journey to Pulicat

Connecting the North and South has assumed a literal sense through the Metro Vizha. Performances will be held inside metro trains, covering both green (St Thomas Mount-Central) and blue (Airport-Washermanpet) lines. However, this time, it is not just music, but also theatre, devarattam, stand-up comedy, Bharatanatyam and parai.

The journey is towards the North — an unrecognised cradle for the arts. The festival will divide its time between Korukkupet and the fishing villages of Ennore. Organised by Arunodaya in Korukkupet, the evening will feature parai attam (by Avvai Home Girls School, Adyar), koothu, kazhiyal aatam and Bharatanatyam. Since 2017, after the Vizha, the team had made parai attam classes a permanent feature at Avvai Home.

“The girls have shown such keen interest and passion to learn. Today, it is with pride that we see them mature into excellent performers,” says volunteer, Sangeetha Sivakumar.

In Ennore, on the other hand, the festival takes on an ecological angle, to make Chennai aware of the encroachment and pollution problems surrounding the Creek. For instance, Abu Baker will present Islamic songs hinting at the environmental crises. “We also plan to invite people from the surrounding eight villages and make this a celebration,” says D Selvarajan of Kattukuppam fishing village.

Cut to February 16, the festival will reach its final destination — Pazhaverkadu (or Pulicat), a seaport older than Chennai by 400 years, for a day-long exploration. “This is the first time we are going so far away from the city. There exists an incredible fishing community of people of all religions living together. We hope at least on this day, we can drag people from Chennai to this region,” says Krishna.

On one hand, Chennai residents will get an insight into the fishing traditions of Pazhaverkadu through tours by the fisherfolk. On the other, their traditional food — caught from the Pulicat lake and the waters off Kattupalli island, and tempered with home-made spices — will be available at a seafood festival back in Chennai.

The Pazhaverkadu trip, with birding, heritage walks and flamingo sightings, will culminate in an evening of music and dance.

“There are some people in this country who are allergic to the word Hindu. They have every right, but they are not right.” The youth should become ambassadors of the country’s heritage and culture. “India was known as Vishwaguru once upon a time and was in the forefront of knowledge creation and sharing it with people from all over the world.

35,2020/01/13,Railways invites RFQ from private train operators,"Indian Railways has invited interested parties to submit a Request for Qualification (RFQ) document by January 17 for selection of private parties to operate 150 passenger trains on 100 routes.

The Ministry of Railways and NITI Aayog said the indicative cost of investment would be about ₹22,500 crore.

As per the draft proposal, the Ministry has grouped routes into 12 clusters that are to be operated through Public Private Partnership (PPP) on design, build, finance and operate basis, with a concession period of 35 years. Railways will adopt a 2-stage bidding process for selecting bidders. The first stage involves qualification. Short-listed applicants will be eligible to take part in the second stage comprising Request for Proposals.

The entire project is expected to be awarded in about 180 days from January 2020. Each bidder is entitled to bid for a maximum of three clusters. Selection would be based on highest revenue share. The project work broadly includes designing, procurement, financing and operation and maintenance of passenger trains comprising a minimum of 16 coaches with the right to collect market-linked fares.

Mumbai-New Delhi, Chennai-Okhla, Howrah-Chennai, New Delhi-Howrah, Shalimar-Pune and New Delhi-Patna are some of the routes on which private trains will operate.

“The idea here is to meet the huge unmet demand that led to loss of passenger business to other modes in recent times,” said a senior official.

37,2020/01/13,Cloud may blur firms’ infras boundaries: Kaspersky,"Infrastructure boundaries are blurring as more and more enterprises are migrating to the cloud environment, according to Kaspersky, a global cybersecurity and anti-virus brand.

Cloud migration has been a dominant trend in the last couple of years with corporates increasingly wanting to move their data infrastructure partially or fully to the cloud.

Interestingly, as per Kaspersky, the trend has created two diverse scenarios in the market: the blurring would make difficult for bad guys to launch attacks on their target companies. As a result, conducting an attack might become harder and actions of threat actors would become more sophisticated or more frequent — relying on chance rather than planning.

At the same time, the blurring might also make it much more difficult for companies (victims) to detect an attack or planned attacks on their resources as the transition to the cloud would have already blurred the boundaries of its infrastructure, said a 2020 Cyber Threats Trends report released by Kaspersky.

“For attackers, it is becoming very difficult to target an organisation’s resources in a precise manner. It will also be difficult for a company to identify targeted attacks at an early stage and separate them from the overall mass of attacks on the ISP,” it said.

Investigating cloud incidents would become more complex and in some cases, less effective. The increase in the availability of cloud services would allow not just companies but also attackers to deploy infrastructure in the cloud. This may reduce the cost of an attack and, consequently, increase their number and frequency, it cautioned.

However, the company said, “We note that the awareness of cloud infrastructure security is not growing as fast as the the popularity of cloud services, so we expect to see an increase in the complexities of investigating incidents as well as a decrease in the effectiveness of incident investigations, resulting in higher investigation costs.”

Due to the increasing cost of other attack vectors, attackers would be willing to offer large amounts of money to insiders. The price for insiders would vary from region to region and depends on the target’s position in the company, the company itself, its local rating, the type and complexity of insider service that is requested, the type of data under ex-filtration and the level of security at the company, the Kaspersky report further warned.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cloud-may-blur-firms-infras-boundaries-kaspersky/article30561322.ece

The forensic report alleged regulatory anomalies with regard to group exposure and limit for non-housing loan portfolio and deviation from certain policies and procedures. RHF said the National Housing Bank (NHB) had taken note of the same and initiated action.

Shares of RHF ended 4.92% lower on Monday at ₹2.32 apiece. The firm said the forensic report had confirmed the potential group entities’ exposure through several intermediate unlisted entities at ₹7,984 crore, including interest. RHF said that it had voluntarily and publicly disclosed it even before the commencement of forensic audit to its auditors.

“Prior to the commencement of the forensic audit and also as a part of the forensic audit, the company transparently submitted full and complete details to its auditors, regulators, lenders, and also in the latest annual financial statements which were duly approved by shareholders, to conclusively establish that the aforesaid amount outstanding of ₹7,984 crore has almost entirely been utilised by the potential group entities only for making payments of principal repayment and interest to banks, financial institutions, NBFCs, NCD holders, etc. There is no adverse finding in this regard either in the forensic audit report,” the firm said.

The forensic audit, which mandated by lenders, was part of the debt resolution process, as per RBI norms.

39,2020/01/13,South Australia can be a model for India on renewable energy,"Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh have built and contracted renewable energy generation capacity — at a combined total of 65.3 gigawatts (GW) of variable renewable energy — at less than ₹3/kWh (US$41.5/MWh) over the last three years.

According to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), India’s tariffs are lower then the average renewable tariff achieved by South Australia over the last three months in real terms as there is zero inflation indexation for 25 years incorporated into these transformational contracts.

The Australian State of South Australia (SA) has been a leader in transitioning its electricity sector to a low-cost, low-emission and a renewable energy-driven system and in a short space of time, has achieved the price of AU$56.84/MWh in November, 2019.

South Australia boasts of one of the highest renewable energy penetrations in the world, despite being located at the ‘end’ of a national grid which severely limits its ability to leverage interstate electricity flows, according to IEEFA.

The State produced 54.6% of its total power generation from variable renewable sources during 2019. Onshore wind and solar (both utility scale and rooftop) represented 49% of total installed electricity capacity, and battery storage another 2%.

“South Australia’s accelerated energy system transformation is a model for States and territories transitioning their power systems, such as India’s top six renewable energy states,” said Kashish Shah, energy finance analyst, IEEFA India in a report.

Unlike South Australia, which is a small, remote market at the end of a long-line grid with just one neighbouring State with which to trade electricity, India’s top six renewable States already have multiple trading partners via a well-functioning and growing interstate grid system, strongly led by the Central government’s Green Energy Corridor investment programme.

This provides an excellent opportunity for leading States to look at increased investment in renewables, not just to meet their own power demand, but also to drive electricity exports to States which do not have great renewable energy potential.

This could allow loss-making discoms of ‘renewable-rich’ energy States to earn new revenues and profits, and spare loss-making discoms of ‘renewable-poor’ States from investing in increasingly expensive new thermal generation capacity, providing a partial financial solution to the current dire state of discoms across India, according to the IEEFA report.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/states-selling-renewable-power-at-less-than-3kwh/article30561306.ece
40,2020/01/13,"Slowing economy hitting payroll creation, says SBI report","The current economy slowdown is impacting employment generation significantly as payroll creation, a proxy for employment generation, could be at least 15.8 lakh lower in the current financial year than the previous year.

In the previous financial year, the country had created 89.7 lakh new payrolls, as per EPFO data.

“The slow growth is now having a visible impact on payroll creation. In FY19, India had created 89.7 lakh new payrolls, as per EPFO data. In FY20, as per current projections, this number could be at least 15.8 lakh lower,” State Bank of India’s (SBI) group chief economic adviser Soumya Kanti Ghosh said in a report.

The EPFO data primarily covers low-paid jobs as the salary is capped at ₹15,000 per month. Government jobs and private jobs are not within its ambit as such data had moved to the NPS beginning 2004.

“Interestingly, even in the NPS category, State and central governments are [expected] to create close to 39,000 jobs less in FY20, as per current trends. Hence, the number of new payrolls created in FY20 could be at least 16 lakh lower than in FY19,” the report said.

The country’s growth rate is expected to fall to an 11-year low of 5% for the current financial year, the government said last week.

The SBI report noted that the extent of formalisation had declined steadily and is now currently at 9.5% of overall payroll creation versus 11% in FY19. Hence Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections may stay below the ₹1.1 lakh crore per month mark the Centre is hoping to exceed. The prospect of lower payroll creation in government shows it was not recruiting afresh in lieu of retiring staff, it added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ut4ypd/article30561273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUJOBS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/slowing-economy-hitting-payroll-creation-says-sbi-report/article30561274.ece
41,2020/01/13,Nusli Wadia withdraws suit against Tata,"Industrialist Nusli Wadia withdrew a criminal defamation petition and a ₹3,000-crore civil defamation suit filed against Tata Sons’ chairman emeritus Ratan Tata, a week after the Supreme Court asked them to amicably settle their differences like ‘mature leaders of industry.’

The Tatas’ side had already made a statement saying they did not intend to defameing Mr. Wadia. This same statement from the Tatas is already a part of the Bombay High Court’s decision in the case.

“In view of the statement made by [Mr.] Tata that there was no intention to defame [Mr.]Wadia, which is in accordance with the finding of the high court, the petitioner is hereby allowed to withdraw the present petition as well as the pending suit for damages,” a bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde observed.

The court had already made its intention clear in the previous hearing on January 6 that the two industrialists should amicably end the dispute rather than drag it on in the court.

Mr. Wadia had alleged that Mr. Tata had made defamatory statements against him shortly after the removal of Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons’ chairman on October 24, 2016.

Later, Mr. Wadia was removed as an independent director on the boards of the Tata Group companies sometime between December 2016 and February 2017.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nusli-wadia-withdraws-suit-against-tata/article30561266.ece
42,2020/01/13,Govt. gets cracking on GST evaders with data analytics,"The Department of Revenue has identified as many as 931 cases of fraudulent GST (Goods and Services Tax) refund claims through data analytics and has now tasked the GST data analytics wing to scrutinise all past and pending refund claims filed all over the country for inverted duty structure, sources said.

Refund claims worth more than ₹28,000 crore are said to have been filed by over 27,000 taxpayers so far on account of inverted duty structure in the current financial year.

The sources said such identified taxpayers, who had purchased goods from tax-evading, non-filers, would face verification and scrutiny as necessary.

This is being reviewed and monitored weekly by Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey.

The sources said to curb input tax credit (ITC) frauds, data analytics is to be done on all refunds since 2017, keeping an eye on the modus operandi of unscrupulous refund claimants or fly-by-night or shell business entities for availing fake ITC.

GST formations have booked 6,641 cases involving 7,164 entities till November last year and have, so far, recovered about ₹1,057 crore.

The highest number of such fraud cases have been booked in the Kolkata zone, followed by Delhi, Jaipur and Panchkula (Haryana), the sources said, adding that fraud recently detected by central tax authorities in Delhi, involving GST refund for inverted duty structure, was deliberated at the second National Conference on GST last week.

Fake ITC credit

The sources also said investigators in Delhi had cracked — through data analytics — a significant fraud case wherein fraudsters created a network of over 500 entities comprising fake billing entities, intermediary dealers, distributors and bogus manufacturers of ‘hawaii’ chappals for availing and encashing fake ITC credits.

The bogus ‘manufacturers,’ created in Uttarakhand, were making supplies to other fictitious entities and retailers in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.

The raw materials for the chappals, known as EVA compound, are chargeable at 18% duty whereas chappals are chargeable at 5%, sources said, adding that as a result, the law allowed the manufacturers to claim refunds of the inverted duty structure in cash. GST investigators found an ongoing parallel investigation in Uttarakhand to be connected and took swift action in preventing refund claims of ₹27.5 crore.

Through meticulous cyber-planning, fraudsters had created over ₹600 crore of ‘fake credit’ which they would have continued to encash had it not been busted.

The main accused in this case was arrested in December and continues to be in judicial remand.

It was also through data analytics that recently, GST formations had identified a few exporters with ‘star’ status who were fraudulently availing IGST refund and were untraceable at their registered addresses.

In these cases, an exporter with over ₹50 crore of shipments of readymade garments had taken refund of ₹3.90 crore while the entity’s total GST payment in cash was a mere ₹1,650.

In another case, tax payments in cash have been made for ₹51,201 while the exporter had obtained refund of ₹9.59 crore. The GST data analytics wing had been able to identify all such cases involving fake invoicing and fraudulent tax credits, which have been encashed through the facility of IGST refunds, the sources said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/965hb7/article30561223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUGST-1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/govt-gets-cracking-on-gst-evaders-with-data-analytics/article30561224.ece
43,2020/01/13,‘Kochhar violated ICICI Bank’s code’,"ICICI Bank told the Bombay High Court on Monday that former MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar’s separation from the bank’s services has been treated as ‘termination for cause’ by the board of directors ‘on account of flagrant violation of ICICI Group Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.’

A division bench was hearing a petition filed by Ms. Kochhar on November 20, 2019, challenging the termination of her services by the bank and denial of the agreed remuneration as the MD and CEO without previous approval of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

She alleged this constituted a breach of statutory obligation under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 and said her services were terminated after the board accepted her request for early retirement.

The bank’s affidavit read, “The section of the Act does not confer any right or protection upon Ms. Kochhar much less does it cast any duty upon the bank but instead is a form of regulatory oversight by the RBI for the protection of the banking company and its depositors. It does not govern or regulate Ms. Kochhar’s contract of service, therefore has no locus to make a claim.”

The affidavit said the dispute was purely contractual and “the petition pertains to termination of various contractual benefits concerning Ms. Kochhar (including stock options) and clawbacks of bonuses (which, too, were contractual in nature).”

The affidavit also relied on retired Justice B.N. Srikrishna’s report that noted, “Ms. Kochhar had not made mandatory and appropriate disclosures and failed to discharge her fiduciary duty to rescue and avoid conflict as required by the Code of Conduct as well as applicable laws and rules.”

Meanwhile, on January 10, 2020, the bank also filed a monetary suit against Ms. Kochhar for recovery of amounts towards the clawback of bonuses given to her from April 2006 to March 2018 pursuant to the termination of services. The suit says, “the question regarding the validity of Ms. Kochhar’s service being terminated for cause is an issue that will arise in the commercial suit. Therefore, she ought not to be permitted to raise the same issue in the petition.” The matter will be heard on January 20.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nsy7od/article30561209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUICICI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/kochhar-violated-icici-banks-code/article30561211.ece

45,2020/01/13,Walmart sacks 50 executives in India,"Walmart Inc, the world's largest retailer, has fired around 50 of its India executives as a part of restructuring in the country.

The move underscores the struggles Walmart has faced in expanding its wholesale business in India. The Bentonville, Ark. based company currently operates 28 wholesale stores where it sells goods to small shopkeepers, and not to retail consumers.

The firings mostly affected executives in the company's real estate division because the growth in the wholesale model has not been robust, two of the sources said.

“It's happening because focus is shifting to e-commerce rather than physical (stores),” said one source, who declined to be identified as the decision is not public.

Walmart did not respond to a request for comment.

Walmart has placed bold bets on India's e-commerce sector. In 2018, it paid $16 billion to acquire a majority stake in India's online marketplace - Flipkart, in its biggest global acquisition.

The second source added that while Walmart could slow down the pace of opening new wholesale stores, the focus will increasingly be on boosting sales through business-to-business and retail e-commerce.

“We are also looking for ways to operate more efficiently, which requires us to review our corporate structure to ensure that we are organized in the right way. As a part of this review, we have let go 56 of our associates, across levels at the corporate office,” Walmart India President & CEO Krish Iyer said in a statement.

All of the 56 impacted associates, eight in the senior management and 48 in the middle as well as lower management, have been offered enhanced severance benefits and out placement services to support their transition, he added.

Mr. Iyer, however, ruled out a second round of layoffs in April, terming the speculation as baseless and incorrect. He said the company remains committed to growing its B2B cash and carry business in India.

“We have recently made significant investments to serve our members better and will continue to do so. This includes investments in our brick and mortar stores as well as e-commerce. Our members are increasingly becoming omni-channel shoppers. We are thus investing heavily in technology and have a healthy pipeline of best price stores. This will provide our members a true omni-channel and convenient shopping experience in the future,” said Mr. Iyer.

Layoffs at Walmart’s brick and mortar business began after it bought a majority stake in e-commerce retailer Flipkart in an around $16 billion deal in 2018.

Walmart, as per its strategy to strengthen presence in the Indian market and also compete head-on with global rival Amazon, had announced a mega deal to pick up 77% stake in Flipkart. It was among the first companies in India, which had adopted the omni-channel retail system by integrating online and offline formats.

Walmart has around 600 staff members in the head office in India, out of a total of around 5,300 nationally, one of the sources said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fa3b0r/article30555890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THWALMART,https://www.thehindu.com/business/walmart-sacks-around-50-executives-in-india/article30555891.ece

The accused have been identified as Arun Mohan, the IRP, and Paresh Kumar, the director and the chief executive officer of the Multimax Asset Reconstruction Private Limited. Provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act have been invoked against them. The case has been registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim’s husband, who also worked for FRTech along with her. They were appointed as consultants in March 2017.

“Myself and my wife worked for the company, and the work was mailed to the company from my mail id from time to time (March 2017 to November 2017),” the complainant said, alleging that of the total reimbursement of ₹18 lakh, ₹15.20 lakh was paid.

50,2020/01/13,NGO files plea on the need for NPR,"A petition filed in the Supreme Court on Monday questioned the need for preparing the National Population Register (NPR) if the government has decided to abort the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise.

“When the Central government has already taken a policy decision to not go ahead with the NRC (as mentioned by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India in his speech dated December 22, 2019 and as per the stand of the officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs — as per the media reports dated December 24, 2019), the preparation of the Population Register is nothing but a waste of time, energy and valuable resources of the nation,” Minority Front, an NGO, submitted in the court.

Besides, the NPR, according to media reports, would cost the exchequer ₹3,941.35 crore. It would be prepared within the period of April 1, 2020 to September 30, 2020.

“In the present economic scenario, where there has been a sharp slowdown in economic growth, the entire sum sanctioned for preparation of the NPR will go down the drain as the government is not planning to prepare a nationwide NRC,” the petition said.

The NGO, quoted provisions from the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, which clearly point out that NPR is the first step towards conducting the NRC, and both are intrinsically linked. These Rules provide for preparation of NRC and for issuance of a National Identity Card to those persons whose names have been entered in the NRC. Rule 4 of the 2003 Rules mandate that the NRC would be based on the Population Register.

“It is therefore clear that the preparation of the population register is not only the first step but a pre-condition for the preparation of the NRC. It is on the basis of the data collected for the NPR that doubtful citizens are identified,” the petition, filed through advocate Ejaz Maqbool, submitted.

Further, the fact that the Population Register is prepared only to aid in the exercise of preparation of the final NRC is evident from the text of the NPR notification, which excludes Assam from its purview.

The panel also raised the issue of police frequently imposing Section 144 in parts of Delhi which causes inconvenience to many.

Top officials of the Union Home Ministry and Delhi Police chief Amulya Patnaik appeared on Monday before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs chaired by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma to discuss rising crimes in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR).

Mr. Patnaik was also asked about the recent sit-in by Delhi police officials outside police headquarters. “The Commissioner of Police was told that if the police sits on a dharna, then questions are raised on his leadership,” a member of the committee said.

52,2020/01/13,Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militants led police to rogue officer,"The police had been on the trail of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) DSP Davinder Singh for at least two days before his arrest on Saturday, a senior government official said on Monday.

Singh was arrested while travelling in a vehicle with two wanted Hizb-ul Mujahideen militants and a lawyer.

Preliminary questioning of the DSP has suggested that he had been sheltering militants in lieu of money and wanted top Hizb-ul Mujahideen commander Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Babu and his accomplices did stay in his house located next to the 15 Corps’ headquarters in Srinagar’s high security Badamibagh area on Friday.

Officers of the country’s top intelligence gathering agencies — the Intelligence Bureau (IB) and the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) — also questioned Singh in Kashmir. Official sources said the agencies were looking into his connections within Kashmir and outside, especially across the border in Pakistan.

“So far, the investigations could not establish his links with any other police officer or colleague within the police department or him being in touch directly with people in Pakistan or Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). However, investigations are still on and the operation is being widened,” an official said.

The police officer came under the security agencies’ radar after two top Hizbul Mujahideen militants, including cop-turned-militant commander Babu and Rafi Ahmad, and lawyer Irfan Shafi left south Kashmir on Friday and headed towards Srinagar. They also made several phone calls on the way.

According to police sources, the police officer arranged for the trio to move from Shopian to Srinagar. The three militants headed straight for Singh’s Srinagar house.

An AK-47 rifle and two pistols were recovered in a raid conducted there later.

“A police party in civvies stayed put outside Singh’s house the whole of Friday night,” a police officer said.

All four, including DSP Singh, were followed the next day on the Srinagar-Jammu highway in an operation directly spearheaded by Deputy Inspector General, south Kashmir, Atul Goel. They were detained at Wanpoh in Kulgam in the afternoon.

The vehicle is registered in the name of Shafi, an official said. “We have information that in the past he has helped the militants with safe passage. A team was on his trail for two days but he kept dodging them, he finally landed in police net in Kulgam,” an official said.

Investigations suggested that the police officer had helped Babu, who has a reward of ₹20 lakh on his head, flee outside the Valley to Jammu last year too.

“The officer was likely to have helped the militants stay at a safe place in Jammu this time and help them avoid any questioning on the highway,” another police officer said. Mr. Singh is currently posted with the anti-hijacking wing at the Srinagar International Airport. His role in the August 26, 2017 terror attack at the District Police Lines in Shopian is also being investigated, the official said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9ma5u7/article30560792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THRDPULWAMA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hizb-ul-militants-led-police-to-singh/article30560793.ece
53,2020/01/13,25th Republic Day parade for IAF bandmaster,"Warrant Officer (WO) Ashok Kumar, 47, is a seasoned bandmaster of the Indian Air Force (IAF) band contingent. However, this year’s Republic Day parade on January 26, 2020 is a particularly memorable one as it is his 25th parade marching across the Rajpath.

He joined the IAF in 1994 and started playing the trumpet and bugle in the IAF band a year after.

He has been the bandmaster for 12 years. To become the bandmaster, there is a six-week drum major course conducted by the Army Education Corps at Pachmarhi in Madhya Pradesh, which he completed in 2011.

“It is a matter of pride to honour the President of India while leading the IAF contingent,” he told The Hindu on Monday, recounting his experiences on the sidelines of a briefing on the IAF’s Republic Day parade participation. “Now the standards have changed. The tunes have also changed a lot,” he said. about what has changed over the years. “Our schedule has got a lot tougher.” In fact the changing tunes, of late adopting a lot from Bollywood, has been a matter of much debate in the last few years.

While the IAF marching contingent consists of four officers and 144 personnel, the band contingent has 72 personnel and three drum majors. The selection of personnel for the contingent is a very rigorous process. It is done by the Director Music, Officer ceremonials and the band leader under direction of Air Headquarters, Mr. Kumar explained and other than music factors such as marching, stamina and height are also considered.

The contingent starts practising on Rajpath about two months before the parade and the practise goes on from 4.30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. He is the bandmaster at the parade and Beating Retreat.

Praise from Michelle Obama

His most memorable moment was during the parade in 2015, when U.S. President Barack Obama was the chief guest.

“When we were marching, First Lady Michelle Obama made a good comment and we were given an on-the-spot commendation from then IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal Arup Raha,” he recounted.

“The next day at Air Force Station, New Delhi, ACM Raha gave a commendation and highly appreciated the performance of the drill band,” he added.

To a question on what is in store ahead, Mr. Kumar said he had nine more years of service remaining and hopes to match the record of Honorary Sub-Lieutenant Ramesh Chand Katoch from the Navy who marched on Rajpath for 30 years and led the band for 20 years before retiring in 2018. Hon Sub.Lt. Katoch holds the longest record from any Service and Mr. Kumar is the second. “When we have a doubt we ask his guidance,” Mr. Kumar said about the veterans Navy bandmaster.

Mr. Kumar hails from Karnal in Haryana and has played music as a hobby much before joining the IAF. When asked about his family, he says with a smile, “I am a grandfather.” He has two daughters, one son and two grandchildren.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4f6etr/article30560681.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG3085,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/25th-republic-day-parade-for-iaf-bandmaster/article30560682.ece

55,2020/01/13,BJP booklet on Modi sparks protests,"The depiction of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “latter-day King Shivaji” in a booklet of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sparked protests across Maharashtra and demands that the party immediately withdraw it and halt further publication.

Aaj ke Shivaji, Narendra Modi, written by Jai Prakash Goyal, BJP leader and president of the United Hindu Front (an umbrella body of fringe right wing outfits), provoked the ire of pro-Maratha outfits such as the Sambhaji Brigade. Shivendraraje Bhosale, BJP legislator from Satara and direct descendant of the Maratha warrior king, urged his party superiors to rein in “overzealous” activists like Mr. Goyal.

The Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) staged protests in Nashik, Kolhapur and Osmanabad, while members of the Sambhaji Brigade held a demonstration against the BJP near Lal Mahal, the legendary palace in Pune where King Shivaji lived as a child along with his mother, Rajmata Jijabai.

“If the BJP does not withdraw this booklet within a week, then the Brigade will ensure that not a single BJP office is left standing in Maharashtra,” warned its leader Santosh Shinde.

The outfit further demanded that Chhatrapati Shivaji’s 13th descendant, ex-Satara MP and BJP leader Udayanraje Bhosale, spell out his stance.

Effigies burnt

Members of the Brigade also burnt effigies of Mr. Goyal in Solapur, while a police complaint against the BJP leader was lodged by a Shiv Sena activist in Solapur’s Faujdar Chavadi police station.

Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said: “Shivaji Maharaj cannot be compared to anyone, even Balasaheb had said, when he was compared to Maharaj.”

56,2020/01/13,DGCA provides IndiGo relief,"The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has provided relief to IndiGo and extended the deadline for replacing all snag-prone Pratt and Whitney (PW) engines in the airline’s fleet by four months, though the engine maker recently identified a new problem.

In November 2019, the DGCA instructed IndiGo to replace 120 engines on its PW-powered A320neo planes by the end of January 2020, following four instances of mid-air engine shutdowns in the span of a week. However, on December 16, 2019 PW notified a new cause for glitches in the low-pressure turbine in engines — “fracture of Mid Turbine Frame (MTF) Piston seal” — and advised boroscopic inspection of the engines. Following this, another 15 engines were identified for replacement. The watchdog has now said that the airline can replace all its engines by May 31, 2020.

Holiday delay

In a statement, the DGCA said that IndiGo will be able to replace only 70% of these engines by the January 31 deadline. “The procurement of modified engines was adversely impacted due to holidays during Christmas and New Year at MRO [maintenance, repair and overhaul] facilities,” the DGCA reasoned.

However, IndiGo has already replaced one out of two engines per PW-powered A320neo in its fleet, in accordance with a different advisory issued by the DGCA.

“It is expected that the mitigation measures put in place, such as the introduction of MTF Piston Seal, in addition to the existing Boroscopic Inspections and introduction of Alt Climb procedure, will help in containing the engine failures on wing,” said the DGCA.

The Alt Climb procedure refers to the lower thrust during climb advised by the DGCA after it found in November that the application of higher thrust during take-off by IndiGo pilots may be related to engine incidents.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sj9mhk/article30080903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dgca-provides-indigo-relief/article30560540.ece
57,2020/01/13,House panel looking into surrogacy issues,"The parliamentary select committee set up to look into the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019 will travel to Anand, Hyderabad and Mumbai from January 21-24 as part of deliberations on the shape of the Bill. Anand, a town in Gujarat, has a large number of commercial surrogates, while Mumbai and Hyderabad also have many clinics on the cutting edge of fertility medicine.

A member of the committee told The Hindu that the committee is deeply engaged with the question of whether or not single parent surrogacy be allowed. The Bill in itself asks for a couple to have been married for at least five years and proven infertility, as possible applicants for surrogacy. “But there are many children brought up by single parent families who do well, so why deny singles? The committee is engaged with that question,” said the source.

The committee will also look at the technology and the ethical gap to be bridged in terms of its use. While the Bill currently seeks to ban commercial surrogacy, even altruistic surrogacy can become problematic without a nuanced definition of “close relative”. “There are things that are moral and immoral, but also extra-moral, that is, technology by itself is shorn of morality, but it can be used for moral and immoral purposes, family dynamics in many cases can lead to undue pressure on less powerful members of the family being forced to be surrogates etc., so the definition and regulatory framework has to be nuanced,” said the panel member.

While commercial surrogacy is banned under the Bill, the committee will study just such arrangements during the Anand visit. When the Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha during the last Parliament session, several amendments, including removal of the necessity of the clause asking that only married couples, that too with at least five years of marriage, be allowed for surrogacy. The committee members say they are determined to make it a more up to date law, compatible with the times.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fwd11p/article30560080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Surrogacy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/house-panel-looking-into-surrogacy-issues/article30560063.ece
58,2020/01/13,Amrapali case: SC orders ED to attach corporate properties of JP Morgan for violation of FEMA,"The Supreme Court asked the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on January 13 to attach Indian properties of JP Morgan, which engaged in a transaction with the now-defunct Amrapali Group to allegedly siphon off home buyers’ money in violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and FDI norms.

The ED said it had prima facie found violations of FEMA norms by the U.S.-based JP Morgan and that a complaint in this regard was lodged.

The Supreme Court also allowed the ED to take into custody the defunct group’s CMD, Anil Kumar Sharma, and two other directors, Shiv Priya and Ajay Kumar, who are behind bars on the top court’s order, for interrogation as regards alleged money-laundering offences.

It said the Central agency could take them into custody immediately and once their interrogation was over, they could be sent back to a prison in New Delhi.

According to the share subscription agreement between JP Morgan and Amrapali Group, the U.S.-based firm had invested ₹85 crore on October 20, 2010 to have a preferential claim on profits in the ratio of 75% to JP Morgan and 25% to the promoters of Amrapali Homes Project Private Limited and Ultra Home.

Later, the same number of shares was bought back from JP Morgan for ₹140 crore by two companies — M/s Neelkanth and M/s Rudraksha — owned by a peon and an office boy of Amrapali’s statutory auditor Anil Mittal.

A Bench of justices Arun Mishra and U.U. Lalit was told by ED Joint Director Rajeshwar Singh, who is supervising the probe against JP Morgan, that the MNC remitted the money back to the United States.

“They [JP Morgan] have a lot of properties in India. We want you to attach their office or corporate properties of a like amount. Then they will come running to us and we will see to it,” the Bench said.

Mr. Singh said the adjudication process against the firm had begun in accordance with law.

On December 2, 2019, the ED had informed the top court that it had prima facie found evidence of violation of FEMA by the multi-national firm and recorded the statements of the country head of the company with regard to dealings with the Amrapali Group.

It had said though the investigation was underway, prima facie it appeared that there were also violations of the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and that appropriate actions were being taken.

The apex court had then directed the ED that the investigation should be carried out impartially, properly and expeditiously within a period of three months.

On July 23 last year, the Supreme Court had cracked its whip on errant builders for breaching the trust of home buyers, ordered cancellation of Amrapali Group’s registration under real estate law RERA and ousted it from its prime properties in the NCR by nixing the land leases.

It had ordered a probe by the ED into allegations of money laundering and to look into the charge of FEMA violation by JP Morgan.

“The money of the home buyers has been diverted. The directors diverted the money by the creation of dummy companies, realising professional fees, creating bogus bills, selling flats at an undervalued price, payment of excessive brokerage etc. They obtained investment from JP Morgan in violation of FEMA and FDI norms,” the top court had said.

It had said the equity shares of the group were purchased at an exorbitant price to suit the requirements of JP Morgan and the Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt. Ltd. had diverted home buyers’ funds.

“The shares were overvalued for making payments to JP Morgan. It was adopted as a device for siphoning off the money of the home buyers to foreign countries,” the top court had said as it accepted the reports of forensic auditors.

It had also noted that the shares of Amrapali Zodiac from JP Morgan were ultimately purchased for ₹140 crore by M/s Neelkanth and M/s Rudraksha, shell companies owned by a peon and an office boy respectively.

“The transactions of Amrapali Zodiac Developers Pvt. Ltd. with JP Morgan were clearly in order to avoid the provisions of the Companies Act,” it had said.

The Supreme Court had said it was apparent that M/s Rudraksha was created for money laundering as its two directors and shareholders had no income.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amrapali-case-sc-orders-ed-to-attach-corporate-properties-of-jp-morgan-for-violation-of-fema/article30559881.ece

Lagging behind

During a meeting of the Central Monitoring Committee under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, which is meant to review the implementation of the law, on January 8, States that were found lagging behind in the rehabilitation of manual scavengers were asked to comply soon, NCSK Chairperson and Member of the Committee Manhar Valjibhai Zala said on Monday. He added that in most of the sewer death cases since 1993, when the NCSK was established, compensation to the families of the victims had been paid.

Tamil Nadu, which had the highest number of such deaths, had paid compensation in all but seven of the 234 cases. Gujarat was yet to pay or confirm payment in 48 of the 162 sewer deaths recorded in the State, and in 31 of those cases, the legal heir could not be traced, the data showed.

Practice continues

According to the NCSK, a total of 53,598 people, of which 29,923 were in Uttar Pradesh alone, had been identified as engaged in manual scavenging after surveys in 2013 and 2018. One-time cash assistance had been disbursed in 35,397 cases, with Uttar Pradesh accounting for 19,385 such people. Capital subsidy and skill development training had been provided to 1,007 and 7,383 of the identified manual scavengers, respectively, the data showed.

“The notification for the CAA [by the Centre] has been issued and all district magistrates in U.P. have been asked to collect data,” Mr. Sharma told PTI.

In the first list, over 32,000 refugees have been identified in 21 districts of the State and the exercise is going on in the entire State as per information I have from the State Home Department, Mr. Sharma added.

There are 75 districts in the State.

When asked about the countries they belong to, Mr. Sharma said,”They are from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.”

The districts from where the first list has arrived included Sahranpur, Gorakhpur, Aligarh, Rampur, Pratapgarh, Pilibhit, Lucknow, Varnaasi, Bahraich, Lakhimpur, Rampur, Meerut, Agra.

Sources said Pilibhit has the maximum number of refugees. However, the exact number is yet to be disclosed by the State government.

“The exercise is going on and as the data comes, we will update figures,” Mr. Sharma said.

An NGO, Nagrik Adhikar Manch, has also prepared a 116-page report, “Uttar Pradesh Mein Aaye Pakistan, Afghanistan Evam Bangladesh ke Sharnarthiyon ki Aapbeeti (Unke Utpeedan ki Kahani)” and sent it to the State and the Centre.

The State government has not confirmed whether it was taking the report into account or not.

“We have got the report of the Nagrik Adhikar Manch,” a senior Home Department official said, who refused to elaborate.

The Centre last week had issued a gazette notification announcing that the CAA has come into effect from January 10, 2020.

The Act grants citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

“In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub-Section (2) of Section 1 of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 [47 of 2019], the Central government hereby appoints the 10th day of January, 2020, as the date on which the provisions of the said Act shall come into force,” the notification said.

The CAA was passed by Parliament on December 11.

61,2020/01/13,Govt. launches road accident database,"The government on Monday launched a central accident database management system that will help in analysing causes of road crashes and in devising safety interventions to reduce such accidents in the country.

The IT tool, known as the Integrated Road Accident Database (IRAD), has been developed by the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) and will be implemented by the National Informatics Centre. The project costs ₹258 crore and is being supported by the World Bank.

Highest fatalities

The system will be first piloted in the six States with highest fatalities from road crashes — Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. The IRAD will be improved on the basis of the learnings from the trial, following which it will be rolled out across the country.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari inaugurated the IRAD at the road safety stakeholders’ meet. Mr. Gadkari said that around 30,000 tablets would be distributed to police personnel across the country to record data on accidents.

How it works

The IRAD mobile application will enable police personnel to enter details about a road accident, along with photos and videos, following which a unique ID will be created for the incident. Subsequently, an engineer from the Public Works Department or the local body will receive an alert on his mobile device. He or she will then visit the accident site, examine it, and feed the required details, such as the road design. Data thus collected will be analysed by a team at IIT-M, which will then suggest if corrective measures in road design need to be taken.

Road users will also be able to upload data on road accidents on a separate mobile application, which is expected to go live from April 1, according to a Ministry official.

Overspeeding

India sees the largest number of road fatalities in the world. More than 1.5 lakh people lost their lives in road crashes in the country in 2018, according to government data. Of the total people killed in road crashes in 2018, 48% were between 18 years and 35 years old, and more than 60% of such fatalities were due to overspeeding.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tislts/article30559705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GADKARI-RAJNATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-launches-road-accident-database/article30559706.ece

He was in Lahore, Pakistan, to deliver a scientific lecture, and arrived in India via the Wagah-Attari border on Monday.

“It’s good to be back in India and I’m looking forward to my lecture tour,” Professor Ramakrishnan, who is President, Royal Society of London, said in a video message, uploaded on Instagram by his communications team.

Dr. Ramakrishnan, recipient of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, will be the 2020 Speaker of the TNQ Distinguished Lectures in the Life Sciences. It will be the tenth edition of this lecture series.

In Lahore, he was a plenary speaker at ThinkFest, which featured discussions on science, art, diplomacy and politics. Dr. Ramakrishnan spoke on Gene Machine, his popular science memoir.

India-born Dr. Ramakrishnan will be lecturing in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai and New Delhi.

Research life

Professor Ramakrishnan has spent most of his research life on the ribosome, the cell structure necessary for making protein, and his proposed lecture, ‘My Adventures in the Ribosome’ is expected to be about his scientific journey. His book Gene Machine explains his work, the road to the Nobel Prize, and the competition among various research groups to figure out the ribosome’s structure.

Dr. Ramakrishnan has not shied away from political statements. Last month, in an interview to The Telegraph in London, he criticised the Citizenship Amendment Act, which discriminates against Muslim refugees to India. “We are not Pakistan. We are different in that we are secular...India is taking a wrong turn,” the newspaper reported.

The Nobel Laureate schooled in India but holds dual British-American citizenship.

Significant impact

The annual TNQ lectures are delivered by scientists who have made a significant impact on the Life Sciences. Previous speakers have included Shinya Yamanaka, 2012 Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine. He won the prize along with John Gurdon for the discovery that mature cells can be converted to stem cells. The 2017 lecture was delivered by Mary-Claire King, a University of Washington geneticist, who pioneered the idea that breast cancer could be a heritable disease. She was awarded the 2018 Shaw Prize in Medicine.

Dr. Ramakrishnan was born in India, where he got his Bachelor’s degree in Physics from Baroda University. After working on components of the ribosome for 15 years, his lab pioneered insights into how the ribosome “reads” the genetic code, as well as into various aspects of antibiotic function.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m0umig/article30559574.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VenkatramanRamakrishnan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nobel-laureate-ramakrishnan-arrives-for-india-tour/article30559568.ece

Senior party sources said that as per the party constitution, once 50% of State level organisational polls are completed, the election for the national president takes place. With the former likely to be completed this week, the national level poll is scheduled for either January 19 or 20.

Poll process

At least three sets of nomination papers are to be filed for the presidential polls, with a minimum of 20 proposers (drawn from the national executive of the party, from various State units). If there is only one name in the fray (as is likely) then the candidate will be announced as elected unopposed.

The current team (sans the old president) will be asked to continue till a new team of office bearers is named by the incumbent.

“The election of a national president is then followed by an endorsement by the national council of the party. A meeting of the council will be called in February after the Delhi polls are done, and the endorsement sought,” said the source.

Mr. Nadda’s election is said to be a foregone conclusion especially after he was made working president of the party after Union Home Minister Amit Shah took up his assignment in the government.

Mr. Shah had himself been made president when Defence Minister Rajnath Singh became a minister in the first Modi government. After completing the remainder of Mr. Singh’s tenure, Mr. Shah had been elected for a further term at the helm of party affairs in January 2016.

66,2020/01/13,Committee set up by MHA on Assam meets Amit Shah,"A high-level committee, set up by the Home Ministry to suggest ways for providing constitutional safeguards to the indigenous people of Assam, on Monday met Union Home Minister Amit Shah and discussed with him issues related to its work.

A four-member delegation of the committee, headed by Justice (Retd) Biplab Kumar Sharma, met the Home Minister for an hour and briefed him about the progress of its work.

“We have apprised the Home Minister about the progress of our work. The Home Minister has given a few suggestions. We hope to submit our final report within next 15 days,” Mr. Sharma told reporters here.

The committee with more than a dozen members was set up as per the Clause 6 of the 1985 Assam Accord.

According to its terms and conditions, “The committee will assess the appropriate level of reservation of seats in Assam Legislative Assembly and local bodies for the Assamese people.”

“The committee will recommend the appropriate level of reservations in employment under the government of Assam for the Assamese people,” according to a home ministry notification.

Asked whether the panel could finalise the “definition of Assamese”, the retired judge said they were yet to take a decision on it and hope to come to a conclusion soon.

“All members of the committee will soon meet to finalise the report and all remaining issues to be resolved,” he said.

The meeting took place four days after Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal met the Mome Minister and discussed with him various aspects of the Assam Accord’s Clause 6, under which the central government had promised to provide constitutional safeguards to the indigenous people.

The committee is said to have completed its deliberations and discussions with various stakeholders in Assam.

The meeting was held amidst widespread protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Assam. It bears significance as there has been a growing feeling among the indigenous people of Assam that the newly enacted legislation will hurt their interests — both politically, culturally as well as socially.

The Assam Accord provides for detection and deportation of all illegal immigrants, who have entered the country after 1971 and living in the state, irrespective of their religion.

According to CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014, facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

The protesters in Assam said that the CAA violates the provisions of Assam Accord.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4b0jh7/article30559065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THAMITSHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/committee-set-up-by-mha-on-assam-meets-amit-shah/article30559067.ece
67,2020/01/13,"Dhindsas being used as pawns by Amarinder, alleges SAD","The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday accused the Congress of attempting to weaken it, a day after a Punjab Minister termed it to be a personal fiefdom of the ‘Badals’.

SAD leaders Balwinder Singh Bhundur and Prem Singh Chandumajra, in a joint statement, said the way in which Congress Ministers ‘jumped into the fray’ to help MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his son Parminder Dhindsa (both suspended last week from the SAD for “anti party” activities) proved that they were being used as pawns by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh in an attempt to weaken the 'Panthic' party after failing on all fronts.

“Now with Congress Ministers taking on the job of spokespersons for the 'Dhindsa' family. it is clear that they are working as per a fixed game plan in collusion with each other. The cat is out of the bag. The Dhindsa faction, which consists of Mr. Dhindsa, his son Parminder and son-in-law Tejinderpal Singh Sidhu only, are being supported by the Congress with the sole aim of splitting ‘Panthic’ votes,” said the leaders.

The entire rank and file of the SAD was solidly behind party president Sukhbir Singh Badal. “The truth is that no one had left the SAD to join the Dhindsa faction. As many as 11 Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) members from Sangrur and Barnala are standing rock solid with the SAD. Even the four circle presidents nominated by the Dhindsa family recently have chosen to side with the SAD,” they stated.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dhindsas-being-used-as-pawns-by-amarinder-alleges-sad/article30558699.ece
68,2020/01/13,Blackbucks are fighting for survival in Punjab,"Threatened by untamed dogs and stray cattle, the blackbuck, Punjab’s State animal, is fighting for survival at the Abohar Wildlife Sanctuary in the Fazilka district.

Change in land use and cropping patterns across the region over the years has also disturbed the natural habitat and consequent fall in the population of this majestic species, officials and experts told The Hindu.

In 2019, as many as 30 blackbucks died in the sanctuary, most of them on account of injuries caused by stray dog attacks. Five injured blackbucks were saved following medical intervention from the State Forest and Wildlife Department. Blackbucks have also died in road accidents, and by taking a fall into water storage tanks and concrete drains.

According to State government data, in 2018, 25 blackbucks died and 18 injured blackbucks were saved. In 2017, 42 blackbucks died in the sanctuary area and 33 were saved with medical treatment.

Privately held land

“Around 90% of the blackbucks that died in 2019 were killed by stray dog attacks. In the past few years, the problem has become even more grave as locals, in a bid to save their crops from stray cattle, have put up barbed wires and nets around farms. Such fencing restricts the free movement of blackbucks. When dogs attack and chase them, blackbucks collide with fences, which often results in fatal injuries,” said Anita Rani, Wildlife Range Officer.

Abohar is an open wildlife sanctuary, spreading across private land in 13 villages.

The blackbuck was notified as State animal of Punjab in 1989, and its presence in the State is confined only to the Abohar Wildlife Sanctuary, with its unique habitat of semi-arid plains featuring agricultural fields, intermittent fallow-barren land, scattered sand dunes and mounds, and ridges.

In the sanctuary, where land in mainly owned by the local Bishnoi community, there were 3,273 blackbucks, according to the 2017 census conducted jointly by the Punjab Biodiversity Board (PBB) and the Forest and Wildlife Department, against 3,500 in 2011.

To resolve menace

Wildlife activists believe that if the problem of stray animal menace is resolved, it would go a long way in saving blackbucks. “Successive State governments have failed to address the problem of stray cattle and feral dogs. If the problem of stray animals is resolved, then I am sure farmers will not fence their farms with barbed wires, which would eventually allow free movement of blackbucks and help them flourish,” said R.D. Bishnoi, State president of Akhil Bhartiya Jeev Rakshak Bishnoi Samaj.

Mr. Bishnoi said that even though the State government collects “cow cess”' in the name of taking care of stray animals, the problem continues to aggravate as no concrete steps are being taken to resolve it.

‘Cobra’ wires

Abohar’s Sub-Divisional Magistrate Poonam Singh said that the administration was taking steps to protect blackbucks. “For the past over a year, we have been successful in removing most of the ‘cobra’ wires. Also, along with the Wildlife Department, we have been persuading locals to remove barbed wires by creating awareness among them about the ill-effects of these wires,” she said, adding that the sale and use of barbed wires has been banned.

Cobra wire has a blade-edged iron mesh and is one of the reasons behind fatal injuries caused to blackbucks.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8ipdxi/article30558657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BLACKBUCK-AKHILESHKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/blackbucks-are-fighting-for-survival-in-punjab/article30558658.ece
69,2020/01/13,Parliamentary panel questions Delhi police chief over use of force against protesting students,"A parliamentary panel on Monday questioned Delhi Police officials over the use of force against protesting students and suggested that it should have dealt with the students in a mature manner, sources said.

The panel also questioned the Delhi police about the frequent imposition of restrictions in the national capital which it said causes trouble for the common man.

Top officials of Union Home Ministry and Delhi Police chief Amulya Patnaik appeared on Monday before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs chaired by senior Congress leader Anand Sharma to discuss rising crimes in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR).

Without mentioning the recent incidents of violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) and Jamia Millia Islamia, members of the panel questioned the way in which police dealt with students who were protesting and the frequent imposition of Section 144 in the national capital which causes trouble for the common man.

Members also asked about the action taken by police against the protesting students, especially the use of force on them.

72,2020/01/13,Union Minister Naqvi to lead delegation to Oman to condole demise of Sultan Qaboos,"Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi will lead a delegation to Oman on Tuesday to convey India’s condolences over the demise of Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, one of the longest-serving rulers in the Gulf region and a close friend of New Delhi.

India is observing a day of state mourning on Monday over the death of Qaboos. He died on Friday at the age of 79.

Making the announcement of Mr. Naqvi’s visit to Oman, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said he will carry a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Sultan Sayyid Haitham bin Tariq al Said, who was sworn in as successor of Qaboos.

The MEA described Mr. Qaboos as a “true friend and well-wisher” of India who was instrumental in guiding and elevating India-Oman engagements to the strategic level.

“Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, Minister of Minority Affairs is leading the government of India delegation to Muscat on 14 January to pay our sincere and heartfelt condolences on behalf of the government and people of India,” the Ministry of External Affairs said.

Mr. Qaboos, who wrested power in 1970 and led Oman’s rapid growth and development, was widely respected globally for his vision for the Gulf region.

“In the passing away of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos the world has suffered an irreparable loss of a visionary leader and statesman who not only led his nation towards remarkable progress and prosperity but also was a beacon of peace for our region and the world,” the MEA said.

It said India maintained close and friendly relations with Oman under the leadership of Sultan Qaboos.

Earlier, Prime Minister Modi congratulated Sayyid Haitham on taking over as Sultan of Oman.

“I heartily congratulate HM Sayyid Haitham bin Tariq al Said on taking over as Sultan of Oman. I am confident that under his leadership, Oman will continue to progress and prosper and contribute to global peace,” he tweeted.

73,2020/01/13,SC asks govt to respond to homebuyer’s plea challenging insolvency ordinance,"The Supreme Court on Monday asked the government to respond to a petition challenging the newly promulgated Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance of 2019, which retrospectively prohibits individual homebuyers from initiating insolvency proceedings against builders.

A Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman issued notice to the government and ordered status quo in the case of insolvency applications already filed by homebuyers in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

The order was based on a petition filed by a homebuyer, Manish Kumar, represented by senior advocate Aishwarya Bhati and advocates Akash Vajpai and Vaibhav Manu Srivastav.

Section 3 of the ordinance prescribes a minimum threshold for initiating insolvency resolution proceedings before the NCLT. It required that NCLT need to take cognisance only if it receives an application for insolvency process jointly filed by 10% or 100 in number of the total allottees/homebuyers, whichever is lesser, from the same real estate project.

The ordinance, promulgated on December 28 last, gave homebuyers who had moved the NCLT exactly 30 days to find 99 other like-minded allottees from their failed residential project to join their cause or risk their case being thrown out without a hearing. The status quo order from the apex court comes as a relief for these whose applications are pending in the tribunal.

The petition said the ordinance created a “class within a class” and suffered from manifest arbitrariness.

Mr. Kumar said “his right to a home will be affected through Section 3 of the ordinance”.

He said the IBC was passed by Parliament to standardise the laws relating to insolvency and bankruptcy that were hitherto fragmented and unorganised. There, however, was doubts about the status of homebuyers, who were considered the most vulnerable lot in case a real estate project goes under.

Subsequently, Parliament passed the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Act of 2018.

“This effectively said that homebuyers/allottees were also to be treated as ‘Financial Creditors’ as under the Code,” the petition said. The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the Act in 2019.

Now, Mr. Kumar said, the ordinance meant to overthrow the 2018 Act and left homebuyers helpless.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4298nv/article30537200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-asks-govt-to-respond-to-homebuyers-plea-challenging-insolvency-ordinance/article30557640.ece
74,2020/01/13,Congress raises questions over arrested J&K police officer’s role in the Parliament and Pulwama attacks,"The Congress raised questions on Monday over the role of Davinder Singh, a senior Jammu and Kashmir police officer arrested for ferrying terrorists, in the Parliament and Pulwama attacks and asked if he was only a pawn in a bigger conspiracy.

In a swift operation, police arrested Mr. Singh, a deputy superintendent of police, at Mir Bazar in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kulgam district on Saturday, along with Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists Naveed Baba, a district commander of the banned outfit, and Altaf, besides an unidentified lawyer who was working as an overground worker for terror outfits.

“Who is Devinder Singh? What’s his role in 2001 Parliament Attack? What’s his role in Pulwama Attack?” Congress’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said in a tweet.

“Was he carrying Hizbul terrorists on his own or is he only a pawn, as master conspirators are elsewhere? A bigger conspiracy?,” he added.

Mr. Singh’s name had also surfaced during investigations into the 2001 Parliament attack, when convict Afzal Guru had alleged his role. The probe, however, was in Mr. Singh’s favour.

The attack on Mr. Nazeer was part of the attempts to convert the State into a Syria or a Taliban state. The State should take a serious note of the attack on a muslim when he was offering prayers at a mosque. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should respond to the developments. The cultural and social leaders of the State should also make their views on the incident known, he demanded.

It was following the instigation from the Chief Minister that the BJP leader was attacked. Kerala has also become the safe haven for terrorists, Mr. Radhakrishnan said.

(PTI adds)

Mr. Nazir was allegedly attacked inside a mosque at Nedungandam in Idukki district on Sunday, shortly after he participated in a programme on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), police said.

While the BJP alleged activists of Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and the pro-CPI(M) Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) were behind the attack, police have maintained that since the incident took place inside a mosque, it was not clear who had attacked Mr. Nazir.

The BJP leader was obstructed by a group of people when he entered the Thookkupalam Jumah Masjid to offer prayers after the Jana Jagriti meeting.

However, the Imam allowed him to offer prayers.

In a joint statement, the leaders also appealed to citizens to come out in large numbers to protect the spirit of the Indian Constitution on January 23, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose' birth anniversary, undertake mass readings of the Preamble on January 26 and remember the sacrifices made by Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, the anniversary of his martyrdom.

“The CAA [Citizenship Amendment Act], NPR and NRC is a package that is unconstitutional, which specifically targets the poor, the downtrodden, the SC/STs and the linguistic & religious minorities. The NPR is the basis for the NRC. We demand the withdrawal of the CAA and the immediate stoppage of the nationwide NRC/NPR. All the Chief Ministers, who have announced that they will not implement NRC in their State, must consider to suspend the NPR enumeration as this is a prelude to NRC,” read the statement.

Sonia's charge

Presiding over a meeting of Opposition parties, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, in her opening remarks, accused the Union government of “letting loose a reign of oppression, spreading hatred and dividing people on religious lines”. She alleged that the country’s economy was facing an imminent collapse but Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were trying to divert attention from it by focussing on polarizing issues.

“The real issue facing India today is the collapse of economic activity and slowing growth and development, affecting all sections of society, especially the poor and disadvantaged. The Prime Minister and the Home Minister have no answers and want to divert the nation’s attention from this grim reality by raising one divisive and polarizing issue after another,” she said.

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said, “I challenge the Prime Minister to go to any university and speak to students without security and tell them about how he plans to fix the economy and how he plans to provide jobs to students and youth of this country.”

The meet was to formulate a common strategy to carry forward the protests against the CAA, NRC, NPR and the violence against students in different campuses, continuing restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir and the state of the economy.

But more than a common strategy and the parties in attendance, the notable absentees seem to have become a talking point.

The absentees

The Congress’ all weather ally, the Dravida Munetra Kazagham (DMK) surprised everyone by boycotting the meet as it was upset over a reported remark by a Tamil Nadu Congress leader.

The Congress’ new ally, the Shiv Sena, talked of a 'miscommunication' to explain its absence.

The Samajwadi Party (SP) too didn’t attend even though it was part of the Congress-led delegation to President Ram Nath Kovind to protest against police action on students of Jamia Millia Islamia.

West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee did not send any representative, and gave the meeting a miss.

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati skipping the event was also on predictable lines.

Owing to Assembly elections in Delhi in less in three weeks, the Aam Admi Party (AAP) too did not attend the meeting. In a triangular contest, the Congress is the second main contender apart from the BJP in the coming Delhi polls.

“We are all one on the issues,” said Ghulam Nabi Azad of the Congress, playing down the differences between Opposition parties.

79,2020/01/13,DGCA extends deadline for IndiGo to replace all unmodified PW engines till May 31,"The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday extended the deadline for IndiGo to replace all 135 unmodified Pratt and Whitney (PW) engines from January 31 to May 31, a statement issued by the aviation regulator said.

On November 1, stating that desperate measures were required to put things in order, the DGCA had told IndiGo to replace the PW engines in 97 A320Neo aircraft at all costs by January 31.

Four Air Turn Back (ATB)/Inflight Shut Down (IFSD) events were witnessed on Airbus A320Neo aircraft operated by Indigo in a week during October 2019 due to the failure of 3rd stage LPT (low pressure turbine) blades.

In some aircrafts, only one of the PW engines is unmodified and has to be replaced.

Later, unsatisfied with IndiGo’s speed in replacing the unmodified PW engines, the regulator on November 25 had instructed it to ground an old A320neo family aircraft with an unmodified PW engine for every new A320neo plane added to its fleet to prevent large-scale cancellation of flights from January 31 onwards.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) stated on Monday that it believes that the unmodified PW engines do contain an unsafe condition, which is prone to undesirable outcomes and therefore, it needs to be dispensed with.

“Post DGCA order dated 1 November 2019, all stake holders that is, the airline and the aircraft and the engine manufacturer have made significant efforts towards completion of the task. They have jointly submitted a complete action plan, which finds the change of engines for the entire fleet feasible by the end of June 2020,” said the regulator in its press statement on Monday.

“It involves procurement of about 135 engines and month-wise details have been worked out to achieve the goal. Needless to say, the timeline looks impressive if we recall that originally it was expected to be accomplished in 14 months, which is from November 2019 to December 2020,” it added.

However, DGCA felt that it can be compressed further and should be achievable by May 2020.

“Therefore, the revised timeline for complete removal of unmodified engines from the fleet is May 31st 2020. It is further laid down that no aircraft with unmodified engine in Indigo fleet shall be allowed to fly after that,” said the regulator.

The PW engine-powered A320neo planes in the fleets of IndiGo and GoAir have been facing glitches both mid-air and on-ground since their induction way back in 2016.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kznd5/article30556470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THINDIGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dgca-extends-deadline-for-indigo-to-replace-all-unmodified-pw-engines-till-may-31/article30556471.ece

81,2020/01/13,Sharad Pawar meets Anurag Thakur to discuss revival of scam-hit PMC Bank,"Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Monday met Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur to discuss possibilities of revival of the troubled Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank.

After the meeting in Delhi, the Rajya Sabha member termed the discussion as ‘constructive.’

The PMC Bank has been put under restrictions by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), after a multi-crore scam came to light, following which the deposit withdrawal was initially capped at ₹1,000, causing panic and distress among depositors.

The withdrawal limit was increased gradually to Rs 50,000.

“Had a meeting with the Union Minister of State for Finance, Shri Anurag Singh Thakur (@ianuragthakur) in New Delhi to raise the issue of revival of PMC Bank. We had a constructive exchange of views on the topic,” Mr. Pawar tweeted.

The fraud at PMC Bank came to light in September last year after RBI discovered that the bank had allegedly created fictitious accounts to hide over ₹6,700 crore in loans, extended to the almost-bankrupt Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL).

According to RBI, the PMC bank masked 44 problematic loan accounts, including HDIL loan accounts, by tampering with its core banking system, and the accounts were accessible only to limited staff members.

Mumbai Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) and the Enforcement Directorate have registered offences in the case.

The EOW last month submitted a 32,000-page charge sheet against five persons in the multi-crore PMC Bank scam.

The charge sheet has named former managing director of the bank Joy Thomas, former chairman Waryam Singh, former director of the bank Surjit Singh Arora, along with HDIL promoters Rakesh Wadhawan and Sarang Wadhawan.

The charge sheet includes the forensic audit report of PMC bank and documents of properties purchased by the accused bank officials with kickbacks received by them for giving undue favour to HDIL and the Wadhawans.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qsrldd/article30556132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THSHARADPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sharad-pawar-meets-anurag-thakur-to-discuss-revival-of-scam-hit-pmc-bank/article30556133.ece
82,2020/01/13,Congress accuses govt of failing to utilise cess amount of over ₹3 lakh crore,"The Congress accused the Modi government on January 13 of failing to utilise a cess amount of over ₹3 lakh crore since fiscal year 2015, saying it was a “shocking case of financial anarchy”.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala’s claim cited a media report saying that the unutilised balance from cesses collected between fiscal year 2015 and 2020 (budgeted number considered for FY20), and lying in the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI), is a staggering ₹3.59 lakh crore.

“Shocking case of ‘financial anarchy’! Between 2014-15 to 2019-20, Modi government failed to utilise ‘cess amount’ of a whopping ₹3,59,000 crore! Is it ‘financial insomnia’ or sheer ‘financial incompetence’?” Mr. Surjewala said.

“Modi government beats up, lathi charges, tear gases students demanding affordable education! Modi government refuses to roll back the fee hike in central universities! Yet it utterly failed to utilise ₹49,101 crore of ‘higher education cess’ collected between 2014-15 to 2019-20,” he said in a series of tweets, asking the government the reason behind this.

India is choking because of air pollution, with Delhi and many cities becoming gas chambers, and pollution has emerged as the single biggest challenge in the 21st century for the country and yet, the Modi government failed to utilise ₹38,943 crore of Clean Energy Cess between 2014-15 and 2019-20, Mr. Surjewala added.

“Petrol and Diesel prices go through the roof! Farmers suffer and budget of middle class bleeds as prices skyrocket everyday! Yet Modi government fails to utilise ₹74,162 crore of ‘cess on crude oil’ between 2014-15 to 2019-20!

Shiv Sena, the Congress ally in Maharashtra, has also said it wouldn't take part in the meet.

BSP chief Mayawati accused the Congress of “betrayal” and said the party had “poached” the BSP MLAs in Rajasthan on two occasions despite the BSP providing outside support to it in government formation.

“In such a scenario, the BSP attending the meeting of Opposition parties under the leadership of the Congress would drop the morale of the BSP workers in Rajasthan,” Ms. Mayawati wrote on Twitter on Monday.

The former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, however, clarified that her party was opposed to the CAA and NRC. “We once again demand the Central government to withdraw this divisive and unconstitutional law,” she said.

84,2020/01/13,CAA: Chidambaram wants Modi’s televised Q&A session with critics,"A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) conferred citizenship rights instead of taking it away, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Monday suggested that Mr. Modi have a televised debate on the issue.

In a series of tweets, the senior Congress leader said the Prime Minister should consider debating the issue with five of his most articulate critics.

“PM says that CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) is meant to give citizenship, not take it away. Many of us believe that CAA (in conjunction with NPR or NRC) will declare many persons as ‘non-citizens’ and take away citizenship,” the former home minister said.

“PM is not talking to his critics. The critics do not have an opportunity to talk to the PM. The only way out is for the PM to select five of his most articulate critics and have a televised Q and A session with them,” he said.

“Let the people listen to the discussion and reach their conclusions on the CAA. I sincerely hope PM will respond favourably to this suggestion,” he added.

The former Union Minister said that Mr. Modi talked from high platforms but did not take questions from anyone on the issue.

On Sunday, the Prime Minister spoke at a function in Kolkata where he reiterated his government’s stand that the CAA conferred rights instead of taking it away and the issue had now helped raise international awareness about minorities being persecuted in Pakistan.

85,2020/01/13,HC takes serious view of curbs in capital villages,"Taking a serious view of the restrictions imposed under Sec.30 of the Police Act and Sec.144 of Criminal Procedure Code in the capital villages, the High Court directed the Advocate General (AG) of Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) to file an affidavit by January 17 explaining the circumstances that led to the crackdown on farmers and women who are protesting against the proposed shifting of the capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam. The case was adjourned to January 17.

Hearing a batch of writ petitions filed by the aggrieved farmers, Chief Justice Jitendra Kumar Maheswari observed that the matter needed to be dealt with expeditiously as the fundamental rights of the people appeared to be deprived and that the march through the streets by hundreds of police personnel was objectionable.

The CJ has also pointed out that the Supreme Court directions on Sec.144 were supposed to be followed and it should not suppress the people’s democratic right to stage peaceful protests.

The petitioners argued that they were not allowed to venture out of their houses and even children were whisked away by the police.

MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, who flagged off the rally, led the public from the front by holding a placard ‘Thank You CM’, apparently to show the people’s gratitude for the proposal to decentralise development. The rally started at Krishnapuram Thana and reached Gandhi circle near APSRTC bus station, where people overwhelmingly supported the idea. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Reddy said that the idea was in contrast to the erstwhile TDP regime’s proposal of focussing every aspect of administration and governance in and around Amaravati.

Development model

The TDP’s development model was acceptable neither to the people of Amaravati, nor to the other regions, going by the manner in which the party had been defeated across the State in the elections. “All that the former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did was to create a myth and keep the people perennially confused, without taking the fruits of development to their reach”, he fumed. Mr. Reddy also added that the opposition parties had ganged up against the popular government, as they had nothing concrete to do.

88,2020/01/13,JSP to contest polls to local bodies,"Jana Sena Party is all set to make its debut in the local body elections. This was disclosed by Siva Sankara Rao, general secretary of Jana Sena Party, at a press conference here on Monday.

Speaking to the media, he said that the State of Andhra Pradesh has suffered under the rule of two families in the last couple of decades and now the situation was the worst.

Justifying the JSP supporting the TDP in 2014 and then walking out, Mr. Siva Sankara Rao said: “The Jana Sena supported the TDP in 2014, since the State has been divided at that time and there was no capital for the State. Moreover, Mr. Chandrababu Naidu has vast experience and the need of the hour was to stabilise the State financial and economic situation. Unfortunately, Mr. Naidu’s experience has not helped, instead he was not able to control sand mafia and land mafia, and there was widespread corruption and lawlessness. He (Naidu) also accepted the package in place of Special Category Status, which our leader Pawan Kalyan had opposed.”

Bolisetti Satyanarayana, environmentalist and JSP leader, said that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had made many promises, but within six months people have realised that he was not keen on fulfilling them.

Moreover, by floating the idea of changing the capital he has created a rift among the people of different regions. Mr. Satyanarayana also accused the State government of using the police for their whims and fancies.

Referring to the recent incident in Kakinada, where JSP workers were attacked, Mr. Siva Sankara said: “Mr. Pawan Kalyan has taken the Kakinada incident very seriously and is going to announce his plan of action to create a secured feeling among public so that they can cast their vote fearlessly.”

In this connection Jana Sena has appointed a committee under the leadership of Mr. Siva Sankara Rao to conduct meetings in the districts of Srikakulam, Vijayanagaram and Visakhapatnam, meet the cadre personally and to reveal the strategy of the party for the upcoming local body elections and also identify the possible candidates for MPTC and ZPTC elections.

Environment

Speaking about environment, Mr. Satyanarayana said that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy should first take care of the people of four villages: Kanampalli, Mabbuchintapalli, Bhoomiahgaripalli and K. Kottala, who are suffering due to leakage of uranium from tail pond in Pulivendula.

“If he cannot take care of villages in his own constituency, how can he assure environment protection of 21,843 villages of this State,” he said.

He also pointed out that Chillapeta tank in Bhimili, Mudasurlova and Meghadrigedda in Vizag and Kalyanapulova were the most neglected by the previous governments and he could not initiate anything so far to protect them.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jsp-to-contest-in-local-bodies/article30560115.ece

JSP president Pawan Kalyan offered to extend issue-based support to the BJP in a meeting with its national working president J.P. Nadda and he responded positively, according to a source in the JSP, who maintained that it was not a formal alliance.

Mr. Kalyan also called on Union Minister of State for External Affairs and BJP’s A.P. affairs in-charge V. Muraleedharan and co-incharge Sunil Deodhar separately along with JSP political affairs committee chairman Nadendla Manohar and BJP MP Tejasvi Surya.

Capital issue

The finding of a common cause by the former allies came a few days after Mr. Kalyan made a categorical statement that the BJP should not only take up the cause of the aggrieved farmers in 29 capital villages but also ensure that the State government did not shift the capital city to Visakhapatnam in the name of decentralisation, arguing that the consequences would be disastrous.

The JSP chief told media persons recently that the Centre was obliged to get involved so that normalcy could be restored in A.P. and also because it has stakes in the capital project.

The Centre cannot be a bystander having recognised Amaravati as the capital of A.P. and spent over ₹2,500 crore on infrastructure creation there, he observed while strongly objecting to the imposition of prohibitory orders under Sec. 144 of CRPC and beating up of women. He insisted that the capital issue was a sensitive one that needed to be sorted out amicably lest the entire State should suffer.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/g4hw6b/article30559960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14VJPAGE4PAWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jsp-bjp-to-work-together-on-important-issues-in-ap/article30559961.ece
90,2020/01/13,"Go to polls on Amaravati issue, Naidu dares Jagan","Telugu Desam Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu has offered to quit politics if all the 151 YSR Congress Party MLAs resign and get elected again on the Amaravati issue.

Throwing this challenge at the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy government, Mr. Naidu asked the Chief Minister to go for elections. If people voted him (Jagan Mohan Reddy) back to power supporting capital at Visakhapatam, he is ready to quit politics forever, Mr. Naidu said at a public meeting here on Monday afternoon.

As part of the campaign against the three capitals idea, Mr. Naidu began his rally from the Kodikonda check-post in the district. The YSRCP workers tried to stop the convoy, but the police pre-empted it and made preventive arrests also.

Rubbishes reports

Accusing the government of getting ‘tailor-made’ BCG and G.N. Rao committee reports, he asked people to celebrate Bhogi festivities by burning their copies like other waste material in their house.

Mr. Naidu said he was not against the development of Rayalaseema, but favours ‘One State One Capital’, and pointed out that even now Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was proposing to divide High Court into three parts and setting up benches in Visakhapatnam and Amaravati, but all this can happen only if the Centre and Supreme Court give their nod.

He pointed out that travelling to the proposed Executive capital would take two days from Hindupur and just for a day’s work, people would need to spend five days. Giving an example of his love for Rayalaseema development, he said he had brought KIA Motors India factory, which generated number of jobs locally.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had defrauded the government and people in the name of Lepakshi Knowledge Hub and was making rounds to the courts, while did not make efforts to retain the Jockey hosiery unit in Anantapur and allowed it to go away, the TDP leader said.

Terming Amaravati a golden goose, Mr. Naidu alleged: “We gave the YSRCP government the property worth 2 lakh crore at Amaravati and he does not know how to use it and generate revenue for the State,” he observed.

‘Impact on IT sector’

“The Millenium Towers at Visakhapatnam, which the government proposes to make the Secretariat, was built by me for Information Technology sector, but the move would have an impact on the job sector,” he said.

The High-Power Committee would meet on January 17, State Cabinet on January 18, and the Assembly on January 20 and the Legislative Council on January 21, Mr. Naidu said pointing out at the hurry with which the government was taking these steps.

Naa Vooru-Vizinaagaram founder Gummuluru Vishala and other members of the organisation distributed rice packets and other essential goods to eight families.

The station, which is housed near Police Commissionerate, is also likely to be shifted to a new block that is coming up at Yendada.

Director-General of Police Gautam Sawang had said that the WPS in the city would be strengthened with additional staff and infrastructure since cases under Disha Act were going to be dealt by it. Keeping this in view, the city police have proposed upgrading the station to a new building block, as the existing station does not have the required infrastructure.

""There will be additional staff in the station. It needs to have a reception, children care room, counselling centre, chamber for three/four sub-inspectors, which the existing WPS does not have. So the proposal for upgradation of WPS and its renaming as Disha Police Station has been moved,"" said a senior police officer.

According to the officer, the new building complex would house various other stations including PM Palem Law & Order, traffic stations, apart from ACP (Madhurwada) office. A block is likely to be given to the WPS.

""The building is in the final stages. May be it will be ready within 15 days to a month. If the proposal gets the final nod from the higher officials, we will inaugurate the building during the next visit of the Chief Minister,"" said the officer.

Disha Act

The city police are yet to receive proper guidelines about the Disha Act. It is learnt that Crime Investigation Department (CID) is preparing the standard operating procedure (SOP) which is yet to released to the department.

""Disha Act cannot be invoked in every case. It may depend on the severity of the case. It is also yet to be clarified whether local Investigating Officer (I.O) can book Disha Act or is it the the DSP/ACP rank officer. Officials concerned are working on the guidelines,"" said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone I) S. Ranga Reddy.

In the meanwhile, sensitisation programmes are being conducted over the Disha Act in the city. Assistant Commissioner of Police (WPS) Prem Kajal said meetings were being conducted with ACPs and Station House Officers (SHOs) on how to have a quality investigation within the short time.

""All we need is quality investigation in short time. We are learning about the provisions, how to receive victims, how to collect the evidence, opinions from prosecutors. In the meanwhile we are expecting the SOP soon,"" said Ms. Kajal.

Staff

According to Commissioner of Police R.K. Meena, at least three additional sub-inspector rank officers, preferably women will be posted in the police station.

97,2020/01/13,A ray of hope for rape victims,"""Justice delayed, is justice denied"" goes the saying. But, speedy justice is hard to come by, with trials usually taking years to reach a conclusion. The reasons include shortage of judges, judicial staff, witnesses turning hostile, and the like.

Post the recent rape and murder of a woman veterinarian in Hyderbad, the Andhra Pradesh Government, promptly came out with the A.P. Disha Act to ensure speedy justice by setting up Disha Centres to exclusively deal with such cases. One such centre was set up in the premises of King George Hospital (KGH), under the auspices of the District Women Development and Child Welfare Department.

The centre will have a full-time sub-inspector, gynaecologist, forensic experts and duty doctors round-the-clock. The idea is to initiate action against the perpetrators of the crime, through special courts, within 21 days after a crime is committed.

""A total of 12 gynaecologists have been trained for dealing with these specialised cases at the Disha Centre. Unlike in the past when such victims used to be examined at the gynaecology ward, they will now have to be checked in the patient isolation room at the Disha Centre. The material evidence like seminal fluid, blood stains and nails have to be collected and handed over to the police for analysis at the Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL) at Marripalem in the city,"" KGH Superintendent G. Arjuna told The Hindu.

""We have requested the government to ensure supply of ‘safe kits’ (standard kits) for examining of patients in such cases. This is because there is a shortage of standard kits in the local market and we have suggested identification of a single agency for their supply. The RFSL is located about 15 km away from KGH, and we sought opening of one in Andhra Medical College (AMC) or at Sakhi centre (One Stop Centre) for better coordination between the medical and forensic experts as the medical report has to be issued within 48 hours,"" he explained.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a-ray-of-hope-for-rape-victims/article30552775.ece
98,2020/01/13,"Opposition parties urge YSRCP, TDPto oppose CAA, NRC in Assembly","Opposition parties and minority leaders, protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act(CAA) and National Register of Citizens(NRC), urged the members of YSRSP and TDP to jointly pass a resolution in A.P. Assembly rejecting implementation of the CAA and NRC on January 20.

Communist Party of India(CPI) State secretary K. Ramakrishna gave a ‘Chalo Assembly’ call to everyone to put pressure on YSRCP and TDP to convey their message to the Modi government that CAA, NRC and NPR would not be implemented in Andhra Pradesh like 12 other States in the country.

Speaking at a public meeting attended by a large number of minorities and supporters of Left parties here on Sunday, Mr. Ramakrishna accused the BJP of polarising the society.

He asked Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Mr. Chandrababu Naidu to follow the example of Kerala’s Pinarai Vijayan, Mamata Banerjee and ten other Chief Ministers, who opposed the implementation of the CAA.

“Why should 18 crore Muslims in the country live in perennial fear? If we resolve to show BJP its place, none can stop,” said Mr. Ramakrishna.

“Mr. Modi has to take a step back following the large scale agitation all over the country,” he added. CPI leader M. Abdul Gafoor, while making fun of Mr. Modi’s oft-repeated jibe of Tukde-Tukde gang, said BJP was in fact the one breaking the country.

He wanted to know from the Prime Minister why he was not able to go to the North Eastern States despite scheduling visit thrice, and said it was because of the opposition to NRC and CAA in those States. Former JNU president Kanhaiya Kumar was supposed to address the gathering, but he could not make it to the event.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1gezkw/article30552770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJPAGE2ANTICAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/opposition-parties-urge-ysrcp-tdpto-oppose-caa-nrc-in-assembly/article30552772.ece

101,2020/01/13,Alluri statue yet to reach Parliament House,"Sculptor D. Rajkumar Vodayar has carved out over 50 life-size statues of freedom fighter Alluri Sitarama Raju. However, a life-size statue of Alluri, carved by him a few years ago, yet to reach Parliament House in New Delhi.

In 2006-7, the 49-year-old Rajahmahendravaram-based sculptor was asked by the Deputy Secretary cadre officer of the Parliament House on behalf of Parliament’s Statue Committee to create a nine-foot high bronze statue of Alluri to be installed in Parliament House.

Mr. Rajkumar was also communicated the same by then TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu. “I was asked by Mr. Naidu to create both the statues of TDP founder N.T. Rama Rao and Alluri Sitaramaraju at the same time.

However, the NTR’s statue was unveiled in Parliament House while Alluri’s statue finds no takers,”Mr. Rajkumar.

Mr. Rajkumar told The Hindu over the phone; “The fibre idol of Alluri is ready, only bronze need to be added to it. The model statue with the prescribed features has also been approved by the Statue Committee authorities (post-2007) but the governments in power since then did not show any interest to make it happen till date.”

Mr. Rajkumar laments: “The dream to install the Alluri’s statue in Parliament House remains unfulfilled for people of Andhra Pradesh since the time of G.M.C. Balayogi (Lok Sabha Speaker) who strove for it.”

Mr. Rajkumar alleges that the delay in installing the statue in the Parliament House is dues to sheer negligence by the political parties in the State.

Barely a month is needed to add the bronze layer to the fibre statue and give final touches to add some features prescribed by the Parliament authorities.

The cost of the statue is ₹12 lakh, which is to be sponsored by any interested stakeholder — political party, any group or any individual.

‘Forgotten promise’

Marking the 120th birth anniversary (July 4) celebrated in Vijayawada in 2017, then Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had pledged to urge the Central government to install the Alluri’s statue in Parliament House in New Delhi.

However, it appears that he had forgotten the promise.

Alluri Foundation

Alluri Sitaramaraju Yuvajana Sangham Founder president Padala Veerabhadra Rao told The Hindu, “Our society is willing to sponsor the cost (₹10 lakh or ₹12 lakh) for making the Alluri statue. However, the State government needs to take up the issue with the Central government.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2qiaib/article30552588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-VJ-ALLURISTATUE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/alluri-statue-yet-to-reach-parliament-house/article30552589.ece

Based on a report submitted by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) vigilance wing to its Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy directed him to step down from the post immediately.

Addressing the media in Hyderabad on Sunday, Mr. Prudhviraj said he had submitted his resignation through fax and recalled that he had ordered a probe on his own into the incident. Claiming innocence, he said the audio clip was ‘doctored’ and was the handiwork of the opposition parties. He also dismissed the talk that he had spoken in an inebriated condition, maintaining that he had been maintaining abstinence for the last nine months.

Women’s organisations and political parties lashed out at the Telugu film actor for bringing down the reputation of the broadcasting arm of the TTD. Women under the banner of All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA) took out a procession in the city and raised slogans decrying his ‘cheap talk.’

CITU district secretary K. Murali, who is also honorary president of the SVBC Employees Association, demanded that Mr. Prudhviraj be immediately stripped of his post and a comprehensive probe initiated into the allegations of harassment by women employees.

TDP general secretary and former TUDA Chairman G. Narasimha Yadav demanded the suspension of Mr. Prudhviraj, besides booking a case under the Nirbhaya Act for harassing women.

104,2020/01/13,NRI doctors from U.S. to support rural healthcare,"American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI), the largest ethnic medical organisation in the United States representing over 60,000 doctors of Indian origin, will be partnering with the State government to adopt some of the backward villages.

Under ‘Adopt a Village’ initiative, the AAPI is already providing healthcare and other basic facilities in some of the villages. It has provided drinking water and other infrastructure and set up a medical clinic at Burgula village in Telangana. “We want to take it up on a large scale in Andhra Pradesh to express our regards to motherland,” AAPI president Sudhakar Jonnalagadda has said.

Dr. Sudhakar during his recent visit told The Hindu that the AAPI had been working in partnership with Tata Trusts to improve healthcare in rural India. Nearly 75% of poor live in villages and have no access to basic medical care.

“There is a high burden of cancer in India with 1.9 million new cases reported every year and most cases are need of multi-modal and multi-year treatment due to delayed diagnosis. Over 50% of cancer patients visit the doctor for the first time at or past the third stage of cancer,” he pointed out.

Demand-supply gap

The doctor observed that there is a significant demand-supply gap especially for indigent and low to middle income group patients due to limited infrastructure and high cost of care resulting in long waiting time and travel costs compounding the problem by increasing overall treatment cost and reducing survival prospects.

“By partnering with Tata Trusts, the AAPI members are helping through medical, surgical and radiation oncologists to deliver quality care by spending three months in Tata cancer health care centres in India,” he stated.

Contaminated water

Dr. Sudhakar said the AAPI was also working with Community Pure Water Foundation, Inc. (CPW). As per UN reports, he said, India ranked 120th among 122 countries in water quality index and approximately 70% of water supply in the country was likely to be contaminated leading to death of two lakh persons every year. The AAPI would was keen on intervening to supplement the efforts of the government and NGO sector by removing factors causing contamination by leveraging domestically available technology.

Trouble started when hundreds of JSP activists laid a siege to the residence of YSRCP MLA Dwarampudi Chandrasekhar Reddy, demanding that he tender an apology for “using abusive language” against the JSP and TDP leaders.

The situation worsened when the YSRCP activists too reached the place. Soon, both the groups clashed. The police rushed to the spot to quell the violent mob.

Meanwhile, the JSP activists alleged that the police acted with bias. Despite bearing the brunt, only JSP activists were taken into custody, they alleged.

“The police have taken many JSP workers into custody but failed to prevent the attack,” former MLAs Pantam Nanaji and Vanamadi Venkateswara Rao alleged. Senior TDP leader and former Home Minister N. Chinarajappa visited the town and enquired about the incident.

The festival organised by the Vijayawada Book Festival Society and supported by the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation featured over 145 publishers and sellers who set up their shops in over 270 stalls spread in the Swaraj Maidan grounds.

The festival witnessed several book releases at the Sahitya Vedika named after veteran journalist C. Raghavachari. The Prathiba Vedika named after Hema Parimi witnessed various activities from quizzes to career development talks by experts. The closing ceremony was presided by the A.P. Official Language Commissioner chairman Yarlagadda Lakshmi Prasad.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Prasad said that the educationists worry for the country not realising its diversity. Lord Krishna, Christ, Mohammad, Buddha and Mahatma Gandhi influence most of the world’s intellects and three of them were from India, he said and added that wishing for the well being of the entire world is the speciality of India.

Writer and political analyst Telkapalli Ravi said that there would be no use of talking about the greatness of traditions and culture while several Indians continue to struggle for food. He said Vijayawada will hold its glory as long as it promotes literature and witnesses progress.

He requested Mr. Prasad to see that Telugu medium is continued in government schools in the State referring to the State’s decision of English medium for Class I to VI. “There’s no wrong in promoting English but at the same time Telugu shouldn’t be ignored,” he said.

108,2020/01/13,INTACH efforts to protect Buddhist site bear fruit,"After a sustained campaign, heritage lovers and officials have been successful in almost stopping the stone-pelting ritual at Bojjannakonda, a famous Buddhist site at Sankaram, 3.5-km from Anakapalle and 41-km from here.

The villagers, as a part of the ancient ritual, used to pelt stones at a belly-shaped object, believing it to be a part of a demon.

However, following the intervention of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), the practice on the Kanuma day during Sankranti has almost been done away with.

Joint initiative

“With the support of the police and the district administration, we have been able to stop it for the past few years. This time also we have sought the support of the district officials,” INTACH Visakhapatnam chapter convener Mayank Kumari Deo told The Hindu on Sunday.

“Bojjannakonda and Lingalametta are the twin Buddhist monasteries dating back to the 3rd century BC. These sites have seen three forms of Buddhism – the Theravada period when Lord Buddha was considered a teacher, the Mahayana, where Buddhism was more devotional, and Vajrayana, where Buddhist tradition was more practised as Tantra and esoteric form,” she said.

Tourist attraction

The name Sankaram is derived from the term, ‘Sangharama’. It is famous for the whole lot of votive stupas, rock-cut caves, brick-built structural edifices, early historic pottery and Satavahana coins that date back to the 1st century AD.

The main stupa was carved out of rock and then covered with bricks, where one can see a number of images of the Buddha sculpted on the rock face all over the hill.

At the nearby Lingalametta, one can see hundreds of rock-cut monolithic stupas in rows.

Tourists visit the Buddhist sites in large numbers to see the relic casket, the three Chaitya Halls, the votive platforms, the stupas and the Vajrayana sculpture.

Visakhapatnam is famous for Buddhist sites at Thotlakonda, Appikonda, and Bavikonda too.

“Vandalism, or defacing of any order like removing bricks and throwing stones at the heritage site, is highly condemnable. We want the administration to provide enough security on the Kanuma day to prevent damage to the archaeologically significant site,” INTACH, in a letter, urged district Collector V. Vinay Chand.

Heritage visit

Some of the heritage lovers are visiting the site on January 16 coinciding with Kanuma, the day after Sankranti. Heritage activist Jayashree Hatangadi said interested people could visit Bojjannakonda on that day.

Recalling how the ritual had been stopped to a large extent, P.V. Prasad, a member of INTACH, said he had to stay at the site along with other heritage lovers to sensitise the locals not to damage the Buddhist site.

Heritage lover Edward Paul said all the Buddhist sites in the region needed conservation and promotion as north Andhra was home to several relics and monasteries.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/czarr3/article30552293.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJPG4-BOJJANAKONDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/intach-efforts-to-protect-buddhist-site-bear-fruit/article30552294.ece

110,2020/01/13,Jesus statue: Dispute over land allotment,"The Bharatiya Janata Party has opposed the installation of the Jesus Christ statue alleging that it was coming up on ‘gomala’ land illegally allotted to the Harobele Kapala Betta Development Trust.

The contention is that not enough gomala or grazing land is reserved for cattle in the village.

The BJP leaders have alleged that for the 1,828 head of cattle in the village, 5,48 acres have to be reserved for gomala, while there is only 209.22 acres available. Despite this, 10 acres have been allotted to the trust.

However, a copy of the allotment order available with The Hindu states that apart from the 209.22 acres available in survey no. 283, there is gomala land available in other parcels both in and around Harobele village totalling to 1,219 acres.

The other allegation that the trust has been facing is that it had begun work atop the Kapalabetta much before it officially began.

“Our allotment is almost two years old and we did begin work a few months ago, taking all adequate permissions. They have alleged that we have laid private roads. But the road was laid by the State government to build a pump house for the Cauvery Stage V water supply project in the area,” said Kiran Kumar, secretary of the trust.

111,2020/01/13,Harobele’s centuries-old association with Christianity,"Harobele, a small village in Kanakapura district, has a population of about 3,500, most of whom are Christians. The village finds itself in the eye of the storm as they are trying to instal a statue of Jesus Christ atop a nearby hill, Kapalabetta.

Hindu right-wing organisations, which started a campaign against the installation here on Monday, alleged there was “large-scale conversion to Christianity” in the village and the statue was a “conspiracy” towards the same end.

But records indicate that Christianity in Harobele village dates back to 1662. Fr. Antappa, who has studied the history of the Church in Karnataka, cites a letter by Fr. Simao Martinz, a Jesuit preacher from Portugal to the Jesuit order in Rome on October 31, 1662, that records this. Martinz was preaching in Karnataka.

Fr. Antappa himself hails from Harobele. “The village has till date given 36 priests and 112 nuns, which shows the long Christian tradition here,” said Chinnaraj, a resident of the village at the forefront of efforts to instal the Jesus statue.

The first record of Christian worship at Kapalabetta in recent history dates back to 1906 when a path of the cross and a cross were installed by Fr. Lazarus. “That year, the village performed a play ‘Yesu Kristana Padugalu mattu Punaruthana’, written by a teacher Innasappa on Good Friday. In an unbroken tradition, the play is performed on the hillock every Good Friday since then. It is like our village fair and there is a belief that if the play is not completed, it brings misfortune to the village. So we ensure it is completed,” said Rita Reeni, a resident.

The play and the fair is an annual attraction to non-Christian villagers around as well. “It is an annual calendar event in the region. Many of us also go and participate,” said Basavarajaiah, a resident of Nallahalli, a neighbouring village. “There is a belief among the Hindus that giving muni (sacrifice) to the Cross on the hillock brings good fortune,” he said.

Hindus and Christians in the region seem to live in harmony and claim there has never been any communal disturbance in the area. “The church in Harobele runs one of the best schools. Over 100 children from our village, including my grandchildren, go there. We have always lived in harmony. Kapalabetta has always been a Christian site even from my father’s time,” said Hombe Gowda, 85, a resident of Nallahalli. “We are amused at what the leaders are saying and the television is reporting, that Kapalabetta was a Hindu site called Muneeshwara Betta. That is a different hillock. We don’t want the communal harmony of our villages disturbed. Why should we object to Christians putting up a statue of Jesus Christ there? Do they object to us building our temples?” asked Kempe Gowda, 79, a resident of Krishnayyana Doddi.

Hindu residents of the surrounding villages The Hindu spoke to denied any efforts at conversion to Christianity.

Hindu right-wing leaders have claimed large-scale conversion and said the very fact that Christian population that was around 1,000 rising to 3,500 was itself an evidence for the same.

“Records show there were around 1,000 Christians in the village as far back as the 18th Century. Is it a surprise that we are around 3,500 now?” asked Mr. Chinnaraj. “Hindu right-wing leaders are saying we are all converts. Yes, that may be the case with our ancestors 350 years ago. I was born into this religion and is it a crime?”

Muneeshwara

Betta is a hillock that abuts the Harobele dam and is a site of stone quarrying for over two decades now.

“A small Muneeshwara temple was there in a shed in the foothills, but was submerged in 1970s when the dam was built. Since then, even Hindus do not worship at the hillock,” said Kempe Gowda, a resident of a nearby village.

Hindus of the region have since then shifted to Siddeshwara Betta, a nearby hillock to offer “muni”, a form of sacrifice to God.

Prabhakar Bhat visits spot

Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat, who led the rally, was allowed to visit the proposed site of the statue on Monday evening amid heavy police protection.

Later, speaking to mediapersons, he claimed to have found “signs of a Hindu place of worship” atop the hill.

He also said that residents, who deny the hill was ever a Hindu worship site, were “innocents who don’t realise they are being manipulated by politicians.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bgvql/article30561738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGKANAKAPURA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/harobeles-centuries-old-association-with-christianity/article30561744.ece
112,2020/01/13,Will not let Hindu site to be Christianised: Prabhakar Bhat,"RSS ideologue Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat, who led a rally by the Hindu Jagarana Vedike against the proposed Jesus Christ statue at Kapalabetta on Monday, said they would not rest till they build a Muneeshwara temple on the hillock.

Addressing a gathering at Kanakapura town, about 18 km from the hillock, he said they would not “let another Hindu site to be Christianised.”

Mr. Bhat claimed that Kapalabetta was earlier known as Muneeshwara Betta where saints of Natha Parampara performed penance. This was echoed by pamphlets distributed by the HJV, an RSS-affiliated organisation. However, villagers said that Kapalabetta and Muneeshwara Betta are two different hillocks.

Launching an attack on Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar for his support to installing the Jesus Christ statue, Mr. Bhat called him an “anti-national.” Bringing into play the recently enacted Citizenship (Amendment) Act, he said, “Hindus have only one country, which is why Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought in CAA. Let them [Christians] build Jesus Christ statue in America or England. Building one here amounts to anti-national activity,” he said.

He, however, said they were not opposed to Jesus Christ or Allah. “But we are opposed to cheating people in the name of Jesus Christ for conversion. It is this we are opposed to,” he said.

K.T. Ullas, general secretary, HJV South Karnataka, listed out a charter of demands at the rally that included cancellation of allotment of land to instal the statue and bring an anti-conversion Bill. He also set a deadline of January 25 for the State government to cancel the allotment of land and said HJV would launch a State-wide campaign if it failed to do so.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/will-not-let-hindu-site-to-be-christianised-prabhakar-bhat/article30561723.ece
113,2020/01/13,Decision to build Jesus statue is of residents: DKS,"Not perturbed by the Hindutva outfits’ protest against the construction of a Jesus Christ statue at Kapalabetta in Kanakapura constituency, senior Congress leader and former Minister D.K. Shivakumar said on Monday that the decision to build the sculpture was not his but that of local residents.

Responding to a question on the protest by the RSS and BJP leaders in Kanakapura against the construction of the statue, Mr. Shivakumar said: “I will accept abuses against me and my brother D.K. Suresh by them [RSS, BJP]. I will not get hurt. But let them also visit Kanakapura villages and look at the implementation of the Union government schemes such as MNREGA and others. The Centre has given a certificate to Kanakapura for providing the highest number of jobs under MNREGA.”

On RSS ideologue Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat who was at the protest rally, Mr. Shivakumar said: “I do not know who he is, but he or even the Chief Minister or other Ministers can go to the place and examine the land in Harobele. There is nothing wrong in that.”

Mr. Shivakumar had laid the foundation stone for the statue on December 25. He had got 10 acres sanctioned by the State government for it during the H.D. Kumaraswamy regime.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4rlbli/article30561688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGDKS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/decision-to-build-jesus-statue-is-of-residents-dks/article30561689.ece
114,2020/01/13,BASE to hire international faculty,"After receiving flak from various quarters, the Higher Education Department has planned to rope in lecturers for Bengaluru Ambedkar School of Economics (BASE) from other countries. The appointment of the Vice-Chancellor will also be done at the international level.

Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said that they have decided to invite applications from eligible candidates from different universities. He said that they wanted to develop BASE as a leading economics institute.

BASE was established in 2016 and was touted to be on the lines of the London School of Economics. The university started functioning from the 2017-18 academic year and now has 148 students pursuing B.Sc. Honours in Economics and a five-year integrated M.Sc. programme. The institute, which recently got the status of a unitary university, has seven faculty members on full-time basis, besides a chief executive officer and a director. The authorities at BASE will soon advertise for 11 teaching posts that will be filled before the commencement of the 2020-21 academic year.

A committee has been constituted to ensure that the post of the Vice-Chancellor is advertised at the international level. “We will also ask renowned economists in the world to spread to word and help us make it a world class institute,” said an official of the department.

Currently, the institute is functioning out of the visual arts building on Bangalore University’s Jnana Bharati campus. The new building will come up on 43 acres on the same premises by April. Amidst much fanfare, the foundation stone for BASE was laid by the then President Pranab Mukherjee and students were told that they would study Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s view of economics and aspects such as economics of discrimination, caste, monetary economics, and federal finances.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/base-to-hire-international-faculty/article30561681.ece
115,2020/01/13,Private hospitals threaten to suspend cashless treatment over pending dues,"With several crores due from the Union and State governments for the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and the ex-servicemen’s contributory health schemes (ECHS), hospitals have threatened to suspend cashless service under these two schemes citing financial constraints.

Hospitals claimed they are unable to bear day-to-day expenditure and pay salaries to their employees.

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, Devi Shetty, cardiac surgeon and founder of Narayana Health, said: “At least now the government will be aware of the health industry and give us the payment that is due, as well as the realistic tariffs. As of now, we will continue the scheme but after first week of March we will take a decision and stop cashless treatment,” he said.

He said that they would give the governments a month’s time before suspending the service.

A press release by the hospital managements alleged that the four insurance companies are dictating the reimbursement, which is less than what is incurred by the hospitals to render the services.

R. Ravindra, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association, said: “ECHS is for the armed forces. Every month, a certain amount of their salary is being cut for the health insurance, under which their family has to be covered. Thus, there is a special rate for them. The government has so much money but still hesitates to pay it to us.”

The Indian Medical Association, Association of Healthcare Providers India, Federation of Healthcare Associations Karnataka, and Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association have been negotiating with the bureaucracy for the early release of the dues.

‘T&C not honoured’

The terms and conditions that both the governments and hospitals had agreed upon were not being honoured, the doctors alleged. They said that private hospitals are only able to recover 40% of the amount incurred during treatment.

“We believe that we shouldn’t cause trouble the patients, and that we can come up with a viable solution in their interest,” said H. Sudarshan Ballal, director of Manipal Institute of Nephrology and Urology, the chairman of the Medical Advisory Board of Manipal Hospitals Group, and Senate Member of Manipal University.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/private-hospitals-threaten-to-suspend-cashless-treatment-over-pending-dues/article30561675.ece

Deepa said it was possible to bring down the number if riders, especially youngsters, made up their minds not to violate traffic rules.

She was speaking after inaugurating the 31st National Road Safety Week programme at JSS College here on Monday.

SP Vartika Kaiyar, principal Krishnamurthy, and others were present. Ms. Deepa released handbills, posters, stickers and the documentary brought out by the Department of Information and Public Relations on the occasion.

The DC, who also chairperson of the Road Transport Authority said people should familiarise themselves with traffic rules and help others know and follow them. It has been decided to create greater awareness on the need to follow rules with the participation of the youth. Reluctance of the youth and others to follow rules is a major cause of road accidents, she said.

She appealed to the people to avoid reckless and drunken driving, using cell phones while driving, and to wear helmets. The RTA would hold awareness programmes with government departments, educational institutions and others as part of the National Road Safety Week programme, she added.

Department of Transport Belagavi Division Joint Commissioner J. Purushothama said that 70% of road accidents happen due to human error and the remaining 30% due to the issues related to road and others.

117,2020/01/13,Fish exhibition attracts many,"The fish exhibition being held at Raisin Trading Centre near Indoor Stadium of the city, has been attracting many visitors owing to the marvellous and expensive aquatic species on display. The three-day exhibition that began on Sunday, will close on Tuesday evening.

Some of the fish on display are: diamond stingray, platinum alligator gar, flower horn, elephantnose fish, ranging between ₹2,000 to ₹2 lakh.

Most expensive is the diamond stingray found in the Amazon. The cost is depends on the size. “For a 1 kg stingray, the price could go up to ₹5 lakh,” said Srishail Ganganahalli, Senior Assistant Director, Department of Fisheries, here. These fish are expensive as they are rare and several of them are imported.

The objective of the exhibition is not only to make people aware of the fish and encourage them to have small aquariums at homes or offices, but also to educate them about revenue generation from this work.

“There are many youth raising ornamental fish for commercial purposes. This business demands proper knowledge of raising the fish, but if done right, guarantees good returns,” the officials said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6vpf45/article30561613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGVIJAYAPURAFISHMELA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fish-exhibition-attracts-many/article30561614.ece
118,2020/01/13,Protest over delay in road-widening work,"Demanding commencement of the work of widening Milaghatta-Anna Nagar Road at the earliest, Congress party activists led by K.B. Prasanna Kumar, former MLA, staged a protest in the city on Monday.

Addressing the protest meet, Mr. Kumar said that the road, that connects Ashoka Circle with Gopala Gowda Extension and adjacent residential areas, is in bad condition owing to lack of proper maintenance.

He said that at a meeting held on May 4, 2016, that was attended by the then Deputy Commissioner and Commissioner of Shivamogga City Corporation, it was decided to widen and upgrade the 1,000-metre-long road. The Shivamogga City Corporation had agreed to pay an amount of ₹2,000 as compensation for a sq. ft of private land that would be acquired for the project.

In the first phase, it was decided to take up widening work along a 500 m length from Santhe Maidan for which 36 buildings need to be demolished. He said that, of the 36 buildings, the owners of 25 have already got their structures demolished but compensation has not been paid for them so far owing to the negligence of the corporation.

Expressing displeasure over the delay in commencement of the widening work and payment of compensation for the building owners here, he said that this stretch having heavy vehicular density has turned unmotorable owing to the negligence displayed in executing the widening work.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mzuk95/article30561609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13SHIMOGAROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/protest-over-delay-in-road-widening-work/article30561610.ece

Meanwhile, political parties and young writers have demanded that the State government arrest those involved in the attempt to explode petrol bombs.

121,2020/01/13,Manasagangotri campus to go down the solar route,"The picturesque Manasagangotri campus in the heart of Mysuru will soon be harnessing the abundant solar energy to reduce dependence on conventional energy resources in an effort to turn the campus eco-friendly and self-reliant.

The work on installation of rooftop solar systems in the building of Department of Studies in Physics will begin soon. Once completed, the energy needs of the department will be met by the energy tapped by the solar panels.

Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar said, “We hope to get the project done by March and thereafter take up the installation at the Department of Studies in Chemistry. Our idea is to maximise the use of renewable energy, particularly solar, and make Manasagangotri a green campus.”

Prof. Kumar added that the university had plans of installing solar systems on the rooftop of the imposing building of Crawford Hall, the UoM’s administrative headquarters, but the project had been put on hold since the building had a heritage tag. “We shall seek advice and take up expert opinion before taking up any work,” he replied.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/manasagangotri-campus-to-go-down-the-solar-route/article30561563.ece
122,2020/01/13,UoM campus to have ‘green’ transport,"Electric buggies will soon hit the sprawling campus of the century-old University of Mysore (UoM) here for ferrying students and visitors to various departments and other facilities inside the scenic Manasagangotri.

The first batch of battery-operated carts is expected to be rolled out for operations during Makara Sankranti and more such zero-emission means of transport would be introduced in the tree-rich campus on seeing the feedback from the users, according to university authorities.

Two 11-seater buggies will become operational on or before January 15. They will shuttle between the University’s main entrance gate on Bogadi Road and another gate near Senate Bhavan, off Hunsur Road.

The campus has 42 post-graduation departments with over 2,000 students, including those from over 30 countries.

Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar told The Hindu that the university’s larger idea of launching buggies was to make commuting easy within the campus since city buses are not allowed to operate inside. “We could have introduced conventional vehicles for the transportation needs of students but choose the electric buggies as they are eco-friendly and noise-free.” He clarified that buggies would be an additional mode of transport, and students and staff were free to use their own vehicles. “We could free vehicle movement on the campus when at least 25 to 30 buggies are put to use. I have thought of allocating funds in the next budget for procuring a few more of them,” he said.

The university was mulling over charging a nominal user fee both for students and visitors. “A ride could cost ₹3 per person. However, the service will be free for physically challenged persons and elderly citizens. Also, there is a thought of introducing student passes for using the buggies once more such carts hit the campus,” the VC said.

Kukkarahalli Lake, one of the last remaining lakes of the city, is located on the campus. The main campus is spread over 500 acres. Besides the two gates, there is another gate near the campus of SJCE, and security personnel had been deployed at each of the gates.

The university had plans of introducing bicycles inside the campus for the travel needs of students. “Actually, we had thought that one of the docking stations of Trin Trin would be installed within the campus and the same could be used by our students. But the station had been installed away from the campus by the Mysuru City Corporation,” according to Mr. Kumar.

The campus was earlier identified as one of the sites for introducing cycles by setting up docking stations as part of the country’s first Public Bicycle Sharing System (PBSS) which is in operation since last few years.

“We are working out the modalities on how to run the system if the university introduces the cycles on its own. At least 100 cycles are necessary considering the volume of students pursuing various courses on the PG campus,” he said.

The university had earlier come forward to develop cycle tracks when there was a talk of having the bicycle sharing system on the campus.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ma4zb0/article30561549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08MYSBUGGY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uom-campus-to-have-green-transport/article30561550.ece
123,2020/01/13,"Siddaramaiah, Sonia Gandhi to discuss matter of KPCC president","A little over a month after quitting as Congress Legislature Party leader, former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah will meet the party’s interim president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday and discuss picking a new president for the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) and other political developments in the State.

On December 9 last year, the then KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao and Leader of the Opposition Mr. Siddaramaiah resigned from their posts following the party’s drubbing in the byelections to 15 Assembly seats. The All-India Congress Committee is slated to hold a meeting on Tuesday and decide on candidates for both these vacant posts.

While the party high command is expected to ask Mr. Siddaramaiah to continue as Leader of the Opposition, discussions are likely to be confined to picking a new KPCC chief, sources in the party said.

In the running

Mr. Siddaramaiah was invited to the national capital after MLA and senior leader D.K. Shivakumar returned from New Delhi last week. Though there are three or four candidates vying for the post, Mr. Shivakumar is believed to be among the frontrunners.

The leader, seen as the party’s trouble-shooter, is the choice of several leaders, including Ahmed Patel, who is a close confidant of Ms. Gandhi. Party insiders say that a section of leaders has been lobbying hard with the party high command to prevent the appointment of Mr. Siddaramaiah’s choice of candidate, given that his leadership led the party to defeat in multiple elections within the span of two years in the State.

KPCC working president Eshwar Khandre has been playing the Lingayat card and lobbying for the post. Two of Mr. Siddaramaiah’s supporters — M.B. Patil and Krishna Byre Gowda — too are also said to be making a bid for the post. Seven-time MP and Dalit leader K.H. Muniyappa has been lobbying for the post for several months.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/auvmo0/article30564427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGSIDDARAMAIAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/siddaramaiah-sonia-gandhi-to-discuss-matter-of-kpcc-president/article30560813.ece
124,2020/01/13,JD(S) councillors may be taken to resort ahead of mayoral polls,"The JD(S), which has been assured of Congress support for the post of Mayor in the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) as per an understanding, will be packing off its councillors to an undisclosed destination ahead of the mayoral polls scheduled for January 18.

A whip was issued to all the 18 councillors of the party at a meeting held under the leadership of former Minister S.R. Mahesh at the MCC Guest House in Vontikoppal here on Monday.

All the councillors had signed the whip directing them to abide by the decision of the high command in the choice of Mayor. “All the councilors have been asked to remain united and abide by the party leadership’s decision”, JD(S) Mysuru city unit president K.T. Cheluve Gowda told The Hindu.

The 65-member MCC has 21 BJP, 19 Congress and 18 JD(S) members, besides six others including one member from the BSP, which had a pre-poll understanding with JD(S). One seat is empty with the High Court annulling the election of BJP’s Guru Vinayak from Ward 18.

Voting rights

MPs and legislators from Mysuru will also enjoy voting rights during the Mayoral polls.

To prevent the councillors from being poached, the party leadership had decided to send them to an undisclosed destination, probably a resort, on August 16. “They will reach the MCC office around 7.30-8 a.m. on the day of mayoral polls”, said a JD(S) leader.

The party does not wish to take any chances. Mr. Mahesh had asked the councillors to be wary of BJP carrying out “Operation Lotus” in the MCC.

Four aspirants

With the State government reserving the post of Mayor to BCA Woman and Deputy Mayor to SC, JD(S) has four women aspirants belonging to the category reserved for the post of Mayor.

Namratha from Ward number 22, Tasneem from Ward number 26, Reshma Banu from Ward number 17 and K. Nirmala from Ward number 45 staked their claim for the coveted post.

The party leadership’s choice of candidate for the post will be finalised a day before the polls and announced about half-an-hour before the elections, said Mr. Cheluve Gowda.

Cong. decision not yet

The Congress, which will be settling for the post of Deputy Mayor this time, has not yet taken a decision on sending its councillors to a resort before the polls.

Mysuru City Congress Committee president R. Murthy told The Hindu that the party will hold a meeting of its councillors on August 16 and take a decision.

He said the party’s choice of candidate will be taken just prior to the election on January 18.

Mr. Murthy said lobbying has already begun for the post of not only Deputy Mayor, but also for the post of chairperson of standing committees on town planning and reforms, which will come the Congress way this time along with the post of chairperson for the committee on health, education and social justice.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dbbojp/article30560795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MYSSRMAHESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jds-councillors-may-be-taken-to-resort-ahead-of-mayoral-polls/article30560796.ece
125,2020/01/13,Yediyurappa says he plans to attend WEF meet in Davos,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who was in a dilemma about his proposed visit to Davos, Switzerland, to attend the annual meet of the World Economic Forum (WEF), has finally decided to go ahead with the trip. The meet is scheduled to be held from January 21 to 24.

Mr. Yediyurappa is under pressure from the 11 newly elected MLAs to get them ministerial berths as their political defection had helped him form a government in the State. He had earlier indicated that he might skip the foreign visit to focus on Cabinet expansion. However, speaking to reporters in Bengaluru on Monday, the Chief Minister said the trip would happen as planned.

Matter of message

Sources close to him said he has decided to attend the event as abruptly skipping programmes attended by global leaders would send a negative message. However, the BJP leader asserted that he would complete the Cabinet expansion before leaving. This is being seen as an effort to placate the 11 defectors, who are said to be upset over the delay in giving them ministerial berths. A month has passed since they won the Assembly bypelections on BJP ticket.

Denying media reports that he has not been given an appointment by the party high command to discuss the matter, Mr. Yediyurappa claimed that BJP national president Amit Shah had invited him to New Delhi on Monday, but he himself could not make the trip as he had to participate in an event in Raichur.

He said he would try to meet Mr. Shah in New Delhi on Tuesday and would cancel all his pre-scheduled events if the latter agreed to meet him. Otherwise, the Chief Minister plans to meet Mr. Shah during his visit to the State on January 17 and 18 to address a pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act convention.

He sought to assure all the defectors that he would keep the promises made to them. He urged them not to give credence to rumours that the Cabinet expansion may be delayed.

Not in official schedule

The CM’s official engagements for Tuesday and Wednesday do not have any mention of a Delhi visit. This has triggered speculation in a section of the BJP State unit that Mr. Yediyurappa may have just been trying to pacify the defectors.

Some leaders are even sceptical about the possibility of expanding the Cabinet before the CM’s Davos visit.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ptqgoo/article30564455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGBSYDEFECTORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappa-says-he-plans-to-attend-wef-meet-in-davos/article30560641.ece

A.H. Vishwanath, who could not retain his seat in the Assembly bypolls held recently, said on Monday that all 17 defectors had the right to seek ministerial berths. He also warned, “Wait and see what will happen if we are not inducted into the Ministry.”

It may be noted that 11 defectors retained their seats in the Assembly byelections.

Interacting with presspersons in Deodurga taluk of Raichur district, Mr. Vishwanath said, “I cannot predict now what will happen tomorrow if we are not inducted into the Ministry... All of us who quit our Assembly membership and joined the BJP are united and will take suitable decision if we are not included.” He maintained that it was the “sacrifices” of the 17 defectors that helped the BJP to come to power in the State.

Among the 17 MLAs who quit, the majority were from the Kuruba community, he said. The defectors from the community who backed the BJP are Mr. Vishwanath, N. Nagaraju (M.T.B.), Byrathi Basavaraj, and R. Shankar.

Mr. Vishwanath’s warning has added pressure on Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa as the party is said to be thinking of not giving ministerial berths to those who lost in the byelections. Even among the 11 defectors who won, the party is reportedly making efforts to convince a couple to accept posts of heads of boards and corporations instead.

Mr. Khan had announced that he would stage a demonstration in front of Mr. Reddy’s residence to register his protest against the latter’s “objectionable remarks targeting the Muslim community” at a recent public rally supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Heavy police force was deployed around Mr. Reddy’s residence as a result. As the protesters marched towards the MLA’s house, they were taken into custody.

Speaking to presspersons before his detention, Mr. Khan said he had come to Ballari with his supporters to stage a peaceful demonstration. Later, Mr. Khan demanded that Mr. Reddy apologise for his “communal and anti-Muslim remarks”. He should be arrested and pushed, he said.

Superintendent of Police C.K. Baba said a police officer has already been deputed to investigate the case against Mr. Reddy. “We had not given permission for Mr. Khan’s protest. Since he and his supporters were persistent on staging a protest, defying us, the police had to detain him,” he said.

Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah condemned the police action. “I condemn @BJP4Karnataka’s act of arresting (sic) @BZZameerAhmedK instead of Somashekar Reddy for his instigating speech aimed at creating communal violence. Zameer is demanding action against Somashekar Reddy,” he tweeted.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4kgilo/article30564438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGZAMEER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mla-zameer-ahmed-supporters-detained-during-protest-attempt-in-ballari/article30559905.ece
128,2020/01/13,"Be a ‘Good Samaritan’, help within ‘Golden Hour’","Mysuru Traffic Police on Monday stressed on the importance of saving the lives of those injured in accidents with emphasis on the “Good Samaritan Act” and extending help within the “Golden Hour”.

At a programme as a part of the 31st National Road Safety Awareness Week organised for medical professionals at the Platinum Jubilee Hall of MMCRI here, the senior police officials spoke about the law being introduced by the State government and the protection it gave to the Good Samaritans who come forward to provide emergency treatment to the accident victims.

Police Commissioner K.T. Balakrishna and Mysore Medical College and Research Centre Dean C.P. Nanjaraj inaugurated the programme and spoke. Deputy Commissioner of Police B.T. Kavita and Assistant Commissioner of Police S.N. Sandesh Kumar were present.

The city police is observing the traffic awareness week from January 11 to 17. The theme of this year’s observance is reducing casualties in road accidents and minimising accidents.

As there is a need for coordination among the police, public and importantly doctors in saving lives, the police invited doctors from hospitals across Mysuru to seek their support in realising the objectives of the cause.

Mr .Sandesh Kumar, who gave a presentation on the salient features of the Act, said the programme gave an opportunity to share the objectives of the Act and the shield it gave to the “Good Samaritans”. More than 1,200 doctors, nursing staff and other hospital staff attended the awareness programme.

Theatre activists clad in the costumers of historical and mythological characters took part in the demonstration. In a press release, the Okkuta has said that, unable to withstand the discriminatory treatment meted out to them on the basis of religion in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, a large number of Hindu, Budhist, Jain, Christian and Parsi families from these countries had migrated to India. The CAA would enable these families to play an active role in the mainstream here and would result in their comprehensive welfare.

The Okkuta has praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah for their initiative in introducing the CAA. Sandesh Javali, director of Rangayana, Shivamogga; B.R.

130,2020/01/13,Mayoral polls: S.R. Mahesh seeks G.T. Deve Gowda’s suggestion on candidate,"Former Minister S.R. Mahesh on Monday held an olive branch to sulking JD(S) leader G.T. Deve Gowda and invited him to suggest a candidate for the post of Mayor of Mysuru.

Responding to Mr. Gowda’s complaint that he had never been taken into confidence over the selection of candidates for the post, Mr. Mahesh said that the choice is finalised by the party high command after consultation with corporators and local party leaders, and that the high command does not take any decision in isolation. “Let him suggest a candidate. We will discuss it and ask the high command”, Mr. Mahesh said.

Mr. Gowda, who has already expressed his disappointment with the party leadership, had recently said his duty was only to cast his vote in favour of the candidate chosen by the party in the Mayoral polls. Mr Gowda had also regretted that he was not involved by the party leadership while selecting candidates for the post.

Meanwhile, Mr. Mahesh said the JD(S) and Congress had already decided to share power in the MCC. “While the post of Mayor went to Congress in the first term of the Council, it will be the turn of JD(S) this time. Next year again it will go to Congress while the JD(S) will bag the post for the last two terms consecutively”, he said.

Similarly, the two parties will share the post of chairpersons of the four standing committees. While the JD(S) enjoyed the posts of chairpersons of the committees on town planning and reforms and public health, education and social justice last year, the two posts will go to the Congress this time.

The posts of chairpersons of the other two standing committees – taxation, finance and appeals and accounts and audit – that Congress had last time will come the JD(S) way this time.

With each standing committee having a total of seven members, the Congress and JD(S) are expected to have two members each in the committee, leaving the remaining three to the BJP.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mayoral-polls-sr-mahesh-seeks-gt-deve-gowdas-suggestion-on-candidate/article30559141.ece
131,2020/01/13,"District Hospital being launched without doctors, equipment","The Department of Health and Family Welfare in Mysuru has geared up to get the 300-bed District Hospital inaugurated this month without the indispensable medical devices and equipment and the manpower to run the public healthcare facility. The hospital also lacks operation theatres for want of funds.

The hospital, on the ED Hospital campus on KRS Road in Metagalli, constructed at a cost of ₹64 crore, is expected to be inaugurated on January 23 with its civil works almost done. The confirmation of date rests on the availability of Minister for Health B. Sriramulu.

Senior health officials from Mysuru are leaving for Bengaluru on Tuesday to meet the Minister and finalise the date according to his availability. January 23 is the date given by Minister in-charge of Mysuru district V. Somanna, sources told The Hindu.

Despite its launch, the hospital will not be operational immediately since the department is awaiting funds for procuring equipment that are expected to cost ₹10 crore and nod from the government for the appointment of staff, including 60 in-house doctors.

The district hospital was one of the long-pending demands of the Health Department since Mysuru lacked such a facility despite being a major Tier-II city. The Krishnarajendra (KR) Hospital, a 1,000-bed autonomous hospital providing multi-speciality care under the Department of Medical Education, was serving as a district hospital all these years.

The sources said the hospital’s functioning appears unlikely at least in the next few months unless the government makes the funds available for equipment and the doctors were appointed. So far, there has no word from the government on the department’s proposals, it is learnt.

The hospital work began in 2017 and the contract value was around ₹75 crore. The project was delayed. The building should have been fully ready a year ago. About 10 per cent of civil works are said to be pending till date, the sources add.

The hospital is expected to be handed over to the department for carrying out remaining works, mostly installation of equipment, installation of operation theatres and other facilities after its inauguration.

District Health Officer Venkatesh said the hospital needs about 400 staff members, including 60 doctors, 207 paramedical staff, 100 staff nurses, and 28 administrative staff. “The needs of the hospital had been communicated to the government. The inauguration will be a formal one and it will take some time for the hospital to become operational,” he added.

There are also talks to get the senior doctors and the paramedical staff already serving in the department in various places shifted to the new hospital until fresh appointments are made. In case of no fresh appointments, the same staff may be asked to continue.

The district hospital is expected to ease pressure on the K.R. Hospital and Cheluvamba Hospitals, the teaching hospitals of Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (MMCRI).

“We could focus on tertiary care with basic healthcare services taken care by the new district hospital. With limited infrastructure, we are running the services to more number of patients. At least 1,200 outpatients are attended to at K.R. Hospital and more than 50 deliveries are done at Cheluvamba,” said MMCRI Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/district-hospital-being-launched-without-doctors-equipment/article30558547.ece

He told presspersons here on Monday that the Prime Minister and Home Minister should take people of all castes and religion along. They should stop dividing the country based on religion. “The country has been facing many problems including the economic crisis. If they continue to divide the people, ignoring the burning issues, the people will teach them a lesson”, he said.

Further, he said the Centre had been ignoring the demands of the State. The Chief Minister should take an all-party delegation to the Centre to put pressure on the Prime Minister for release of funds. There had been no proper distribution of relief for the flood victims in the State, he alleged.

135,2020/01/13,Karnataka CM Yediyurappa says he will attend WEF event in Davos,"Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who was in a dilemma about his proposed visit to Davos to attend the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting being held from January 21 to 24, has finally decided against cancelling the foreign trip.

Mr. Yediyurappa, who is under pressure from the 11 newly elected MLAs to get them ministerial berths as their political defection helped him to form his government, had earlier indicated that he may skip the foreign visit to focus on ministerial expansion. However, speaking to reporters in Bengaluru on Monday, the chief minister confirmed his foreign visit.

Sources in the BJP said that he has decided to attend the event as abruptly skipping such events being attended by global leaders would send a negative message.

However, the Chief Minister asserted that he would complete the process of ministerial expansion before embarking upon the Davos visit.

His statement about expansion is being seen as an effort to placate the 11 defectors who are said to be upset over the delay in giving them ministerial berths though a month has passed since they won the Assembly bypolls on BJP ticket.

Denying media reports that he had not been given any post by the party high command to discuss ministerial expansion, the Chief Minister claimed that actually party’s national president Amit Shah had invited him to New Delhi on Monday. However, he could not attend because of a pre-scheduled event in Raichur on Monday, Mr. Yediyurappa said.

He said he would try to meet Mr. Shah in New Delhi on Tuesday and would cancel all engagements if Mr. Shah agreed to meet him.

Otherwise, he would meet the national president during his visit to the State on January 17 and 18 to address a pro-CAA convention. He assured the defectors of keeping his promise made to them and asked them not to bother about rumours that the ministerial expansion may be delayed.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lzz6r9/article30491394.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YEDDYURAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-says-he-will-attend-wef-event-in-davos/article30556241.ece

137,2020/01/13,Kalaburagi comes alive with myriad colours,"The main street of Kalaburagi on Sunday came alive with myriad colours as more than 200 artists from different districts assembled to display and sell their artworks as part of the seventh edition of an annual art fair, Chitra Santhe.

It was something that professional and budding artists, painters, art lovers came together to display their art — not in a gallery or a museum, but on the roadside and on the premises of a garden underneath the open sky.

The side-walk along the public garden was covered in sculptures, paintings, murals, installations and mixed-media artworks. Visitors and passers-by were treated to live caricature art, paintings and colourful sketches — from S.M. Pandit Ranga Mandir Gate to the entrance of the Public Garden.

The breathtaking paintings of artist Siddanna Gouda are so impressive that they might make any art lover do a double-take. Mr. Gouda, a native of Hunasagi taluk in Yadgir district, completed his Bachelor of Visual Art Education from Kannada University, Hampi. Even a close inspection of his works will not help believe that they have come from an artist’s paintbrush.

The acrylic painting works of Aditi Gada of I PU and the pencil sketch arts of Syed Ibrahim of Class 7 were also impressive.

An artwork on a theme of women by Aditi enthralled the viewers with its skilful representations. It is hard to believe that the young artist learnt painting by watching videos.

Also, Syed Ibrahim said that he created his pencil drawings just by referring to videos, without any going to classes.

A large number of people thronged to see the sand sculpture of Swami Vivekananda made by artist Manujath Hiremath at Doddanayakanakoppa Layout here. Many visitors took selfies with the sculpture.

Inaugurating the National Youth Day programme organised by the district administration at the Government First Grade College here, Additional Deputy Commissioner Shivanand Karale said that Swami Vivekananda was a saint philosopher who tried to eradicate darkness from society and inspired millions of youth through his speech.

Vivekananda’s life is full of values and inspiration which motivate every person who has read his books. The younger generation instead of spending their quality time on unwanted things, should make their life more meaningful by studying Vivekananda and treading the path shown by him.

“Any student who embraces the thoughts of Vivekananda will achieve success and climb up the social and professional ladder,” he said.

139,2020/01/13,Devaraja Market demolition plan triggers conservation debate,"The demolition of Devaraja Market in the city may not be impending in the immediate future but is ‘inevitable’ going by the official stance on the subject.

Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde told The Hindu that expert committee reports and view of engineers is that Devaraja Market was structurally weak and posed a danger as it would be used by hundreds of people daily and had to be demolished in public interest. The general opinion was that the structure could be conserved only if it were to be a museum-piece to showcase a slice of Old Mysuru architecture and not a functioning market, he added.

The MCC Commissioner said the heritage committee decision and the views of the expert committee will be submitted to the government. Also, the High Court, which is hearing a case against the demolition of the Devaraja Market and directed the MCC to study the feasibility of conserving the structures, has to be informed. Everything will also depend on the HC ruling, he added.

Besides, the matter being sensitive and involving the livelihood of hundreds, a meeting of the stakeholders has to be convened too. Furthermore, the Detailed Project Report (DPR) of the proposed new structure has to be prepared and approved by the authority.

Above all, funds have to be earmarked for it by the government as the MCC does not have money to build a new market of the size of Devaraja Market, said Mr. Hegde. “So we have a long way to go,” he added.

The issue has already left citizens divided. Even the scion of the erstwhile royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar expressed concern over the developments. He said that the expert committee had only one heritage specialist.

The Wadiyars recently completed the restoration and renovation of the Jaganmohan Palace which houses the Art Gallery. Hence, Mr. Yaduveer said they could offer suggestions and technical assistance through their consultants on the conservation of heritage structures.

N.S. Rangaraju, who is in the Heritage Committee, said it was packed with civil engineers with no knowledge of heritage conservation and expressed concern that Mysuru could soon be a graveyard for heritage buildings.

Even the MCC council had passed a resolution a few years ago paving the way for its demolition and reconstruction underlining the apathy of the elected representatives towards heritage conservation.

Adding to the ongoing debate in the city on the impending demolition of the structure, Dr. Rangaraju said MCC officials and the committee constituted by the Deputy Commissioner had ignored the views of Arun Menon, Convener, National Advisory Board, National Centre for Safety of Heritage Structures, IIT Madras. He had visited Mysuru and studied the structure and submitted a report in 2016.

The report noted that most of the Devaraja Market complex was in a fairly good state of conservation, especially the vaulted portions of the structures. However, it had pointed out that there were certain portions in a precarious condition. The overall drift of the report was that Devaraja Market and Lansdowne building could definitely be rehabilitated, and restored.

Technical recommendations included establishing strength of the masonry and assessing the role of previous interventions and mapping existing distress. It also called for reviewing existing conservation practices, development and implementation of structural audit protocols to guarantee the structural health of heritage structures.

But those batting for the demolition of the market have ignored the report, said Dr. Rangaraju.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/experts-report-ignored-rangaraju/article30552814.ece
141,2020/01/13,Students to be warned against protesting without permission,"The University of Mysore will issue a warning to student bodies against holding protests and demonstrations on Manasagangotri campus without obtaining prior permission.

University Registrar Shivappa R. told The Hindu that the student bodies – University of Mysore Research Students Association and Dalit Students’ Association – had given an explanation to the notice served to them by the university.

“In their reply, they claimed that they were holding a protest against the violence in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) recently in New Delhi recently, and that they cannot be held responsible for the controversial placard on Kashmir that was held up during their demonstration,” he said.

The student bodies organising the protest have also said they had nothing to do with the former student, who had claimed responsibility for holding the placard.

Hence, the university has decided to warn students against holding any protest without obtaining prior permission from authorities. “They should not repeat it again. If they do, action will be taken as per law,” Mr. Shivappa added.

Meanwhile, representatives of student bodies organising the candlelight demonstration in Manasagangotri, who had received notices from the police, gave a statement at the Jayalakshmipuram police station on Saturday.

143,2020/01/13,"Pratham Mysore’s education model kindles interest, poised for expansion","A remote village sequestered amidst harvested paddy fields in rural Mysuru may be an unlikely setting for a science exhibition.

Scores of students – mostly from Classes 4 to 7 — were agog with excitement, setting up working models of exhibits covering various aspects of basic science and the environment. It was testing time and an occasion for them to showcase skills and knowledge they had imbibed in their respective schools, at Mutathi village in T. Narsipur talulk on Saturday.

Drawn from Muthathi, Sujjaluru, Mavinahalli, and Hyakanuru in the rural hinterland, the students go to government schools, some of which are devoid of even basic furniture let alone the sophistication of smart classrooms of urban centres. Despite these infrastructural deficiencies, when it came to learning skills, these students proved they were second to none.

Be it environmental issues such as the need to increase green cover through seed balls or explaining the principles of electromagnetism through experiments, the confidence of the participants was matched by their mastery of the subject and fluency of expression.

The students’ ability to shore up their learning skills from these villages came about through a combination of factors. For, supplementing the efforts of the government-appointed teachers was the role played by Pratham Mysore, an NGO engaged in improving learning quality in schools.

Ashvini Ranjan, Trustee, Pratham Mysore, explained that they conceived the idea of a model village in a bid to fill up the gaps that were impeding learning processes among rural children. “We conducted a survey and found that the ability of children to read and comprehend was low and thought of remedial measures,” he explained.

Livelihood problems

A ground-level analysis of the scenario led Pratham to realise that they had to provide a back-up to parents as well, whose immediate concern centred around livelihood issues. So sewing machines were distributed and the beneficiaries were trained in tailoring to increase their incomes, said Bhamy V. Shenoy, who is an advisor to Pratham Mysore.

This was crucial as the livelihood issue was taken care of to an extent ensuring the parents would not disturb their children’s education.

Learning Space Centre

To improve learning skills of children, Pratham Mysore established a Learning Space Centre in the schools, provided computers complete with internet connections - made possible through another NGO. Two facilitators – one for providing computer skills and another to engage with students to shore up reading skills – are part of the programme.

The computers installed with software that makes learning interesting, enhanced their understanding of science and languages. The net result after two years of effort is qualitative improvement in the learning ability of students as was evident at the science exhibition.

“Today, the children who come from economically weaker sections of society and whose parents are daily wagers, are also digitally literate and adept in operating the system. Their learning skills are superior to children from villages where this intervention is not present,” said M.V. Rajendraswamy, headmaster, Mutathi Government Higher Primary School.

144,2020/01/13,Woman from Sagar taluk succumbs to Kyasanur Forest Disease in Udupi,"A 58-year-old woman from Seegemakki village in Tumari Gram Panchayat limits in Sagar taluk has died due to Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, at a private hospital in Manipal in Udupi district on Saturday.

The deceased, Hoovamma, who had complained of high fever and aches in joints was admitted to government sub-divisional hospital in Sagar city for treatment on Tuesday. Her blood tested positive for KFD.

Rajesh Suragihalli, District Health Officer, told The Hindu that, as her health condition had worsened, she was shifted to a private hospital in Manipal on January 9 for advanced treatment. She failed to respond to the treatment and breathed her last on Saturday, he said.

Following the death, the Department of Health and Family Welfare has sounded an alert in Sagar and Tirthahalli taluks from where seven positive cases have been reported since January 1. The vaccination drive has been stepped up in the villages from where positive cases are reported. Three advanced life support ambulances have been stationed in government sub-divisional hospital in Sagar to shift KFD patients with health complications to private hospitals in Shivamogga city or Manipal for additional treatment, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/woman-from-sagar-taluk-succumbs-to-kyasanur-forest-disease-in-udupi/article30552705.ece
145,2020/01/13,"Outer Ring Road, parts of Narasimharaja Assembly constituency turn problematic for MCC","The Outer Ring Road (ORR) and parts of Narasimharaja Assembly constituency are turning out to be pain points for the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), which is going all out to retain the city’s reputation as a ‘Clean City’ in the ongoing Swachh Survekashan 2020.

The dumping of waste generated from newly-developed areas outside the purview of MCC along service roads of the ORR, and inadequate infrastructure to deal with garbage generated in population-dense areas of Narasimharaja Assembly segment has become a challenge for civic officials.

The MCC officials dread the prospect of the service roads along the ORR dumped with waste from areas not falling under its purview when representatives from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs visit the city as part of the Swachh Survekshan 2020. The MCC has jurisdiction only till the ORR, beyond which the garbage clearance responsibility lies with respective gram panchayats.

Also, MCC officials feel that the general public, when asked to give their opinion on the cleanliness of the city, may blame the civic agency for not doing a proper job without knowing that the cleanliness of areas outside the ORR is not the corporation’s responsibility.

The officials have urged the Panchayat Development Officers (PDO) of GP in Hinkal, Bogadi and Srirampura to take necessary steps in the regard. “The GPs are financially well off. They should come together and engage a tractor to collect and segregate the waste,” said MCC’s Health Officer Nagaraju.

Unlike the other parts of the city, garbage clearance was challenging in certain population-dense areas in Narasimharaja Assembly constituency.

MCC suffers from a shortage of auto tippers that collect garbage from homes. The pushcarts pressed into service to make up for the shortage of auto tippers was disrupting the cycle of transferring waste to lorries from secondary collection points. The disruption in the cycle leaves mounds of waste at the secondary points. “We need vehicles for garbage clearance particularly in parts of Narasimharaja Assembly constituency to clear the black spots,” said Dr. Nagaraju.

Presently, there are 169 auto tippers, which is far from sufficient. “We need atleast five to six auto tippers for each of the 65 wards in the city to make the task of waste collection more efficient,” he said. With more auto tippers, the need for secondary collection points can be eliminated. The autos can directly transport the waste to the destination, he added.

A Detailed Project Report (DPR) for acquiring an additional 320 auto tippers has been approved by the government. “We are hoping to receive them soon,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pr0ncr/article30552681.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGMYSURUORRWASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/outer-ring-road-parts-of-narasimharaja-assembly-constituency-turn-problematic-for-mcc/article30552682.ece

148,2020/01/13,Ban on quarrying near KRS likely to hit construction industry,"The blanket ban on stone quarrying in the vicinity of Baby Hills, which has been widely welcomed by farmers and environmentalists, is expected to hit the construction industry around here.

The industry in Mandya, Mysuru and Madikeri districts was hugely dependent on stone extraction units near Srirangapatna and Pandavapura taluks in the district for manufactured sand (M-Sand) and gravel. Nevertheless, with loud hollow sounds and vibrations frequently experienced in the vicinity of the Krishnaraja Sagar owing to the rampant use of explosives at quarries, the district administration has imposed a blanket ban on stone extraction in the surroundings of Baby Hills.

The restriction has come into force and all the 36 such quarries, which were supplying M-Sand and gravel, have been issued strict instructions to stop operations. The quarry operators and owners have also been warned of facing criminal cases if they do not comply.

Alternative to sand

M-Sand is nothing but artificial sand manufactured from crushed stone. It is widely seen as the best natural resource with which to construct buildings. Owing to the unavailability of river sand, the construction industry has been using M-Sand as an alternative. Thus, the ban order will affect the construction industry, said a quarry operator.

Even the ongoing Bengaluru-Mysuru highway development project requires several lakh tonnes of M-Sand and gravel. There are hundreds of projects being taken up in the Old Mysore region, and they too need quarry materials, he said.

The quarries at or near Baby Hills were the prime source of M-Sand and gravel for the construction industry in Mandya, Mysuru and Madikeri. Although there are a good number of quarries in Chamarajanagar and Ramanagaram, the major builders in Bengaluru as well as the public in Chamarajanagar prefer M-Sand from the Srirangapatna and Pandavapura quarries owing to their quality, a senior officer working with the Department of Mines and Geology said.

At present, M-Sand is being sold at quarries near Baby Hills for ₹950 to ₹1,100 a tonne. Now, the industry will have to procure M-Sand/gravel from quarries in Kanakapura of Ramanagaram district, Kunigal in Tumakuru district, or elsewhere.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5d12rd/article30552361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGBABYHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ban-on-quarrying-near-krs-likely-to-hit-construction-industry/article30552362.ece

There is increased risk of substance use among adolescents and young adults during post-disaster situations, according to the Karnataka Mental Health Report-2019 brought out by CHD Group.

The report, released recently, also found a link between mental health and flood, a disaster at the other end of the spectrum. “This calls for priority attention to those hit by the 2019 floods,” said the report. The south-west monsoon floods severely affected life in 103 taluks of 23 districts in the State last year. The victims must be monitored for psychosocial disruptions and provided with extensive rehabilitation, the report said.

The CHD Group, which has been involved in several health relief missions in India and abroad, said, “Disaster mental health services generally follow preventive medicine through multi-dimensional integrated community approach rather than relief-centred post-disaster management.

150,2020/01/13,A pilgrimage centre in Mandya district is crying for attention,"The historical Basti Hosakote village, one of the many popular Jain pilgrimage centres in South India, which attracts Jain enthusiasts and devotees from across the country, is crying for attention.

The village, situated close to the backwaters of the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS), near Bookanakere of K.R. Pet taluk in Mandya district, was once a popular Jain centre in the State. It has a century-old 18-ft Lord Bahubali statue, believed to be installed by the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana in 1147.

Statues of Jain Tirthankaras, ornamentally carved panels, and extensively delicate carvings on pillars near the ‘Bahubali’ lie scattered today. The land, belonging to the Jain centre, has been allegedly encroached upon by some people, while archaeologically significant monuments and sculptures have been vandalised.

With the annual anointing ceremony of Lord Bahubali in the village scheduled for February 2, the issue of establishing permanent facilities for the Jain centre has yet again come to the fore.

Members of the Basti Hosakote Sri Bhagwan Bahubali Digambar Jain Trust and Jain community leaders have urged the State government to provide basic facilities at the place, besides initiating measures for popularising the centre.

Huge statues of Lord Bahubali have been installed at only a few places in South Indian states, especially Karnataka. The anointing ceremony (Mahamastakabhisheka) and other religious activities are being performed there the places regularly, said H.S. Lalithanga Kumar, president of the anointing ceremony committee. According to him, there were five ‘Basadis’ and a good number of statues. However, they were vandalised a long time ago.

Several hundreds of Jain devotees and history enthusiasts often visit the place to worship and study the monuments. Moreover, the tourists visiting the backwaters of the reservoir too visit the Jain temple, said another leader of the community.

Improvement

When The Hindu contacted MLA for K.R. Pet K.C. Narayana Gowda on Sunday, he said, “I have decided to develop the place by providing/improving infrastructure at Basti Hosakote.”

A good number of Jain devotees and members and chiefs of Digambar Jain Mutt are expected to attend the ‘Mahamastakabhisheka’ ceremony. The Jain community has requested establishing a hospital near the Bahubali statue, the MLA added.

Emphasising the need for popularising the Jain centre in the tourist map of Karnataka, he said the State government would initiate measures to develop Basti Hosakote as a tourist centre by providing drinking water, electricity, proper roads, transport and other facilities.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/swirdc/article30552317.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGBAHUBALI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-pilgrimage-centre-in-mandya-district-is-crying-for-attention/article30552318.ece
151,2020/01/13,Minister for speeding up POCSO cases,"Health Minister K.K Shylaja has said that Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) cases should be registered in a timely manner, and that the process should be speeded up.

She was speaking at the inauguration of the Kavacham (shield) scheme, which is part of the Janamaitri Suraksha project, here on Monday. A survey will be conducted in association with the Department of Social Security and the police under the scheme. The first phase of the survey will be conducted in the Kannur range.

The Minister said there were fewer cases registered in Kerala, and that it has been decided to set up as many as 28 POCSO courts in the State. In addition, the department should keep track of the handling of such cases. Ms. Shylaja maintained that even questioning of children should be scientific. According to a recent survey conducted by the Department of Social Justice, 11,00,432 children in the State are eligible for special care, she said.

The school-centred child doctor scheme will be further expanded to address problems facing children, the Minister added.

Earlier, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, after inaugurating the scheme, said it was unfortunate that a good percentage of cases of violence against children happened at home.

He added that violence against children required serious scrutiny of the home situation. The Chief Minister was of the view that when the project is jointly implemented by the Social Justice Department and the police, it could be implemented more effectively.

“There are several people who need special protection, including women and the elderly, and the Government looks at it with special consideration,” he said, adding that they should be made part of the project.

152,2020/01/13,A pre-historic site in dire need of better care,"Whatever be the depredations of colonial rulers, the petroglyphs on the walls of Edakkal caves in Wayanad are a testimony to the sagacity of some imperial officials and their love for the land they ruled. For, it was F. Fred Fawcett, then superintendent of police in the erstwhile Malabar district, who discovered the rock shelter 124 years ago and brought its significance to the attention of the world.

The carvings inside the cave located on Ambukuthimala are pictorial record of dreams, visions, and anxieties of local tribes in the Neolithic Age. Today, the way this archaeological site is preserved leaves a lot to be desired. And, it tells you what makes the difference between a bad conservation and a good one. The woeful state of the conservation of the cave is unjustifiable. The cave’s immense archaeological, anthropological, and historical importance certainly deserves a lot more conservation efforts from the State Archaeology Department, the custodian of the rock art site.

Major threats being faced by the pre-historic site are many — illegal constructions, tourism, mining, and urbanisation.

True, there was an initiative on the part of the State Government to secure the UNESCO World Heritage Monument Status for the petroglyphs. Not only did the Government earmark ₹50 lakh, it also appointed a special officer for the purpose in 2013. Keralam - Museum of History and Heritage, Thiruvananthapuram, was made the implementing agency of the project.

Nothing has come out of this initiative, though. The UNESCO status still eludes the site. Recall a workshop held at Sulthan Bathery in 2013 on conserving Edakkal petroglyphs. The workshop handed over its recommendations to the department. But no action was taken. Though the Archaeology Department appointed an officer to monitor the day-to-day activities at the monument in 2009, the post has remained vacant for the past six years.

To top it all, the Government’s ban on all types of construction activities within 300 metres of the monument a few years ago has not been fully implemented. The proposed survey of the surrounding area by the Revenue Department has been put on hold. After the survey, the land was to be handed over to the Archaeology Department.

Many resorts have already been constructed, flouting all norms in the nearby ecologically fragile area. And, construction activities are still under way in the area.

The local body — Nenmeni grama panchayat — flagged the issue by constituting a sub- committee around three months ago to study the illegal construction and encroachments on the hill slope. The committee has identified illegal constructions including construction of huge structures and water tanks on the hill for resorts. One can just imagine the serious threat such activities are posing to the pre-historic rock shelter and also to families residing on the hill slopes.

Although the custodian of the site is the Archaeology Department, tourism activities in the area are managed by the Edakkal Tourism Destination Committee under the District Tourism Promotion Council. The Edakkal caves being a site of historical importance, there is truth in what historians and epigraphists, who have visited the site, have been saying: “The cave is not well protected at present.”

Maybe there is a solution to the issue of poor conservation of the site. Its takeover by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a national monument could be an answer.

A national monument it really is. Isn’t it better if it is recognised as such by the ASI before it is granted UNESCO status as a heritage structure?

153,2020/01/13,‘Work on 464 bridges taken up in 4 years’,"The Public Works Department (PWD) has undertaken work on as many as 464 bridges across the State ever since the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government assumed power in 2016, Works Minister G. Sudhakaran has said.

Mr Sudhakaran was inaugurating the newly constructed bridge across the river Pampa on the traditional Thiruvabharanam path leading to Sabarimala at Peroorchaal in Ranni taluk on Monday.

According to him, so far, the LDF government could open a total of 120 bridges for the public. Dedication of 50 more bridges will be made soon.

500 bridges

The Minister said the government was trying to initiate steps to construct not less than 500 bridges before its five-year tenure ends next year.

The State witnessed a spurt in development works during the past four years, which was far above the development works carried out over the past 50 years, he said.

A total of 2,500-km-long roads have been reconstructed and more than 2,000 government buildings were constructed during the past four years, he said.

Mr Sudhakaran said the State housed 43 bridges sans approaches when the LDF came to power in 2016, as all of them were constructed without following proper procedures. The government had completed the official formalities and constructed approach roads to all these bridges over the past four years, he said.

The work on the Peroorchaal bridge began at Keekozhoor-kadavu at Peroorchal 23 years ago. As per the agreement, the gestation period of the project was 18 months.

The bridge work was started with financial assistance from NABARD, 23 years ago. But, the civil work was inordinately disrupted on more than one occasion.

Though the bridge was completed two years ago, the delay in constructing the approach road on both ends had further delayed its commissioning. The inordinate delay in the commissioning of the Peroorchal Bridge was a testimony to the sad of state of affairs with various construction works undertaken by the Public Works Department, earlier, he said.

Before Thiruvabharanam

Mr Sudhakaran said he was happy to commission the bridge before the beginning of the Sabarimala-bound Thiruvabharanam procession from Pandalam in connection with the Makaravilaku festival.

154,2020/01/13,Students gherao Principal for 7 hours,"Classes have been suspended for two days at S.N. College, Chelannur, near here, after students gheraoed the Principal for around seven hours on Monday in protest against the termination of services of a guest faculty there.

The Principal was locked inside her cabin from 11 a.m. till around 6.30 p.m. There was tension on the campus for a while and the police took into custody around 15 activists of the Students Federation of India, including the college union chairman and other union functionaries, to bring the situation under control.

The series of events that led to Monday’s protest started in December. The students alleged that Principal V. Devipriya had spoken in an insulting manner to Mohammed Shahil, a guest lecturer attached to the Department of English. They claimed that she had earlier behaved in a similar way with a student too.

They protested after Mr. Shahil was terminated from services at the instance of the Principal, the students said.

Principal’s version

Ms. Devipriya, however, claimed that Mr. Shahil had no control over the students and they were left on their own during classes.

The efforts to convince him about his duties were in vain.

155,2020/01/13,Cruising loop to liven up river,"Come February 2, the Kodoor river that runs through the heart of Kottayam town will present a spectacle from another age – wooden rowing boats moving people to and forth its vast line of aquatic network.

This scheduled procession of canoes, covering a total length of 28.5 kilometer from Pazhukkanila Lake to Puthupally on the upstream, marks the opening of the river as a cruising loop. Named Padiyarakkadu water tourism project and initiated by the Meenchil-Meenanthara-Kodoor River linking project, it also marks the culmination of a three-year-long initiative to restore the river to its lost glory.

According to K. Anil Kumar, convener of the river linking initiative, the route will link up several local tourist attractions such as Malarikkal or Pallam and take the boats up to the Panchikkad Bhagavathi temple and the Puthupally church on the eastern end.

A needed plan

“The tourism circuit with its opening from Kumarakom comprises the river and several of its adjoining canals having connections to several interior destinations. The plan is to flow life into the river by keeping the holiday cheer,” he said.

The opening of the route will be followed up by various local tourism festivals, which will be organised at seven destinations along the circuit starting from Malarikkal on February 2. Further, plans are also afoot to extend the circuit up to the Manarcad church, an international pilgrimage centre, by late next year.

The waterways along the Kodoor river lost its significance with the expansion of the road networks and they fell into an even sorrier state in the last decades with the canals silting up and even levelled overtime.

The river linking project, through works taken up in different phases over the last couple of years, stabilised its canals and even dredged the channels.

Paddy farming

The restoration of the river network also enabled the people’s collective to restore paddy farming in a waste area of polder network surrounding it.

156,2020/01/13,Survey studies sediments in Malampuzha dam,"The sedimentation study by an expert team from the Kerala Engineering Research Institute (KERI) continued in the reservoir of the Malampuzha dam, in spite of the winds slowing down the survey.

The team led by Deputy Director Shini K.K. is measuring the quantity of water available in the 22 sq km reservoir using Integrated Bathymetric System (IBS), a modern survey method used to measure the depth of waterbodies.

The amount of silt in the dam’s reservoir will be measured on the basis of the amount of water currently available. Malampuzha Dam, whose water is used both for drinking and irrigation, has a total capacity of 226 million cubic metres.

The survey team uses sonars for echo sounding and Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) for accuracy. Data is collected at every two-metre interval. The data collected through DGPS and echosounder will be analysed using a computer software to get the exact volume of water.

Winds in reservoir

Ms. Shini said the winds in the reservoir area were affecting the movement of the survey boat. The team aimed at covering one square kilometre in day. However, she said they would finish the study in less than two weeks.

The last sedimentation study in the Malampuzha reservoir was done in 2014-15. Although that study was not an exhaustive one, many concerns have risen since, especially in the wake of the two floods of 2018 and 2019.

An opposite impact?

Although the general perception is that the floods caused by the landslips had brought a huge quantity of mud and soil into the reservoir, dam and irrigation experts have raised another theory that the heavy inflow and the spillage of muddy waters could have actually reduced the silt in the dam.

“It is possible. We have found it in our studies in Peechi,” said Ms. Shini. She said they did not expect a major increase in the volume of silt in the dam in spite of two major floods in successive years.

Desilting proposal

Malampuzha Dam, with its 145-sq km catchment area, has not been desilted since it was erected in 1955. The attempts to desilt the dam in 2010-12 had failed. Experts said desilting a dam like Malampuzha, which caters to the drinking needs of Palakkad and neighbouring places, would involve lots of technicalities. Desilting can even render the water undrinkable for a certain period. According to experts, nowhere in India has a dam been desilted successfully.

In the sedimentation study done in 2005, Malampuzha reservoir was found to have 30 million metre cube silt in it. The results of the current study will throw light on the volume of mud and soil that reached the reservoir in the last 15 years.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jmwwzx/article30561624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TVPD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/survey-studies-sediments-in-malampuzha-dam/article30561615.ece
157,2020/01/13,History of a port city traced in black and white,"Kozhikode is steeped in history of the known and unknown. But for some it is a canvas of mythology, history, folklore, and a multi-ethnic culture, beckoning the heritage enthusiast.

Dating back to the 8th century, Kozhikode has a treasure trove of history left behind by Porlathiri and Samoothiri kings, the maritime traders from Arabia, Africa, Greece, Turkey, and China, conquerors from Mysore, colonisers from Europe, and the numerous trading communities from various parts of India. Heritage walks organised for enthusiasts in the city is now coming out in the form of a book Calicut Heritage Trails. It will be released at the Kerala Literature Festival on Friday.

Written by Captain Ramesh Babu, who was the project manager of the National Institute for Research and Development in Defence Shipbuilding (Nirdesh) for five years, the 275-page book offers an insight into the vibrant chapters of the enchanting history of the black pepper capital of the medieval world.

Stand testimony

“The monuments and memories of the city have withstood the test of time. They have recorded history, mythology, and folklore and stand testimony to this exciting saga of the rise of a coastal marshland to a fabled city,” he said.

What prompted him to write a book on Kozhikode, which finds mention in historical records even from the days of Abdur-Razzaq Samarqandi, a Persian Ambassador, who visited the Zamorin in the mid-15th century? “As a hobby, I used to conduct heritage walks while working in Kozhikode. I was inspired by what I saw and thought that the stories should be written for posterity,” Captain Babu said.

Crumbling structures

According to him, several heritage structures are crumbling in the city, which should be the heritage capital of Kerala. “The book is essentially a compilation of available literature, archival data, news clips, and other published material,” he said.

“The book is a collection of what I saw, felt and heard during the numerous times I walked the streets of Kozhikode, in pursuit of its missing maritime history,” Captain Babu added.

The book has been designed in such a way that it can be used by a tourist, serious student of history, heritage enthusiast, or anyone who wishes to discover the past of this once prosperous port.

With wonderful sketches by Premarajan, an artist from Kadalundi, and maps by Chinnu S. Kumar, a Kozhikode-based heritage conservationist, it takes the reader into piers, forts, palaces, temples, mosques, churches, markets, streets, bylanes, and settlements which are the standing relics of the city’s glorious past.

158,2020/01/13,Probe begins into attack on BJP leader,"The police have launched an investigation into the attack on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State secretary A.K. Nazeer inside a mosque at Thookkupalam, near Nedumkandam, on Sunday, shortly after he inaugurated a Jana Jagriti meeting of the party in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act [CAA].

A senior officer of the Nedumkandam police station on Monday said that a police team had collected the statement of Mr. Nazeer,.

He has been admitted in a serious condition to the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences in Kochi.

Mr. Nazeer was attacked with a chair from behind while he was offering namaz after getting the permission from the imam of the mosque.

Leader prevented

According to reports, the BJP leader was obstructed from entering the Juma Masjid by a group of people.

BJP leaders alleged that the Social Democratic Party of India was behind the attack. But the police maintained that only after collecting details it would be known who attacked him.

Mr. Nazeer had inaugurated the people’s interactive programme Jana Jagriti in the town.

Prior to the meeting, a rally was taken out by the BJP workers.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/probe-begins-into-attack-on-bjp-leader/article30561555.ece
159,2020/01/13,Local body polls: SEC firm on 2015 voters’ list,"The State Election Commission (SEC) has decided to go ahead with its decision to use the voters’ list of 2015 as the database for the three-tier local body elections to be held later this year, virtually dismissing the reservations of political parties that have demanded that the voters’ list for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections be made the database.

The commission on January 4 issued an order to revise the 2015 voters’ list, along with the scheduled dates and guidelines.

Accordingly, the draft voters’ list will be published by district electoral officers on January 20 and the final list on February 28. The cut off qualifying date will be January 1, 2020 and all those who attain the age of 18 will be eligible to be enrolled as voters.

Sources in the SEC said an elaborate exercise was undertaken in 2015 to create a database of voters to be used in the local body elections that year and for the byelections thereafter.

The ward-level database of voters had been created using the booth-level voters’ list for the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 after field and house-level verification.

The sources said for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 and the Assembly elections in 2016, the voters’ list was based on the Assembly constituency level.

A ward-based voters’ list was required for the local body elections, since elections were held to various wards. Even political parties usually organised their election work on the basis of ward committees.

SEC, State blamed

The political parties are apparently not impressed by the SEC decision. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had registered his reservations at the SEC move.

Mr. Chennithala had pointed out to the possibilities of the names of ineligible people being included, along with the names of those who would have died since 2015.

Congress leader V.D. Satheeshan alleged that the SEC and the State government were responsible for the lapses regarding the voters’ list as they failed to take timely and appropriate steps.

Another reason for not using the voters’ list of the 2019 Parliament election is the enormous cost involved, estimated to be ₹10 crore. Besides, the SEC would have to mobilise personnel to carry out the requisite verifications.

The sources said since the SEC was involved in the process of carrying out delimitation of local body wards, it would be not possible to add to the workload of the employees.

Delimitation

The United Democratic Front has also opposed the delimitation of wards on the basis of the 2011 Census. The Left Democratic Front had preferred to go along with the SEC’s decision on ward delimitation. As per the schedule fixed by the SEC, district electoral officers are scheduled to hold discussions with representatives of political parties on January 16 and 17.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/local-body-polls-sec-firm-on-2015-voters-list/article30561547.ece
160,2020/01/13,CB seeks nod to prosecute former municipal chief,"As the dust settled slowly over the sites of the demolished flats in Maradu in Kochi on Monday, Crime Branch investigators moved to unmask the prime political movers behind the planned deceit that had tricked hundreds of apartment dwellers out of their life savings and rendered many of them, including pensioners, homeless.

They have sought the permission of the government to arraign a former chairperson of the Maradu municipality as the prime accused in the case relating to the illegal construction of Jain Coral Cove (CB case no:471/2019).

Investigators have reportedly informed the government that a ruling front politician had actively collaborated with the builder, Jain Housing Construction Ltd., to help the firm fraudulently acquire, reclaim and construct on 113.85 cents of ecologically fragile wetland.

Anti-graft Act

The agency has sought the permission of the government for sanction under Section 17 (a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act to indict him for conspiracy, cheating, and graft.

Investigators have told the government that any delay in receiving permission to prosecute him could affect the probe.

Caution ignored

In the case of Jain Coral Cove, the municipality had repeatedly ignored cautionary reports of various agencies not to grant the company permission to build on the wetland.

Investigators who perused panchayat records found that officials had glossed over reports that the building plan submitted by the firm violated the Coastal Regulation Zone notification. The firm had also illegally fenced off 10 cents of public land for construction purpose.

The CB case is that the accused had conspired with the builder to grant him an undue financial advantage and in the process caused substantial environmental damage and loss to the public exchequer.

Builder moves HC

The CB has also moved for the arrest of the builder, Sandeep Mehta, of the Jain Group. The agency had named him third accused in the case.

The Madras High Court had denied him anticipatory bail in the case. He has now moved the High Court in Kerala for advance bail. Investigators said they feared he could leave the country and delay in disposing of his petition was holding up the probe.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cb-seeks-nod-to-prosecute-former-municipal-chief/article30561541.ece
161,2020/01/13,"Maradu flats demolition decision a painful duty, says Supreme Court","The Supreme Court on Monday said its decision to demolish four high-end apartment complexes in Maradu municipality in Kochi for violating Coastal Regulation Zone notifications was a “painful duty”.

“It was a painful duty for us,” Justice Arun Mishra, the lead judge on the Bench comprising Justice M.R. Shah, observed orally.

The judge’s reaction came after perusing the report filed by the Kerala government about the successful demolition of the flats on January 11 and 12.

For the time being, the Bench preferred not to dispose the case.

Justice Mishra said the court would like to keep an eye on the goings-on in the case, especially while the debris of the demolished structures was being cleared. Some of the debris had fallen into the ecologically fragile backwaters.

Compensation

Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for some of the evicted residents, said “ultimately the majesty of the law has prevailed” but pointed out that there was no sign of any legal action against the officials liable for clearing the illegal building projects.

But Justice Mishra assured “something is indeed happening” in that front.

The court had ordered the Kerala government to disburse ₹25 lakh each to the displaced residents.

On Monday, Mr. Dave acknowledged that the court’s order had served as an interim relief for the distressed flat owners.

But Mr. Dave sought the court’s permission for the residents to move a competent lower court, preferably the Kerala High Court, to initiate legal proceedings for compensation and damages against builders, promoters, and other persons and officials responsible for clearing and raising the constructions.

The residents said they wanted a judicial pronouncement on various issues such as the proportion of liability of each of these parties, from builders to officials responsible, and the freezing/de-freezing of accounts/properties of the builders, etc.

Scheduled on Feb. 10

However, the Bench refrained from passing any order and scheduled the case for hearing on February 10.

The Supreme Court-appointed Justice K. Balakrishnan Nair Committee has already sanctioned ₹61.75 crore to 247 flat owners as interim compensation of ₹25 lakh each. The State government has paid ₹49.37 crore to the flat owners.

Further orders have been issued for ₹8.75 crore and only ₹3.75 crore remains to be paid.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/irowtm/article30561532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TV-MARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/maradu-flats-demolition-decision-a-painful-duty-says-sc/article30561533.ece

Receptions

Devotees accorded rousing receptions to the procession at different places before it reached the Puthiyakavu Devi temple at Ayroor in the afternoon. The procession will resume the journey on Tuesday morning and will halt at the Laha Sathram, near Plappally, in the night.

165,2020/01/13,Central govt. has to chip in for treatment of rare diseases: State,"The State government on Monday informed the Kerala High Court that it alone could not raise funds for treatment of Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSD) afflicted children in the State free of charge and a financial assistance from the Centre was essential as a huge amount was required for the treatment of the rare disease.

The submission was made in an affidavit filed in response to a public interest litigation seeking a directive to provide enzyme replacement therapy free of charge for children suffering from LSD and implement the national policy for treatment of rare diseases in the State.

The petitioner said the national policy had been kept in abeyance by the Centre. The petition has been filed by the Lysosomal Storage Disorders Support Society, Kerala chapter.

Lysosomal storage diseases are a group of about 50 rare inherited metabolic disorders that result from defects in lysosomal function. Lysosomes break down unwanted matter by enzymes, highly specialised proteins essential for survival.

The government pointed out that the supply of drugs for enzyme replacement therapy had a huge financial implication on the exchequer. Therefore, it would become impossible for the State government to set part necessary budgetary provision to purchase essential drugs for all government hospitals. At present, the cost of treatment for a child for one year came to ₹1 crore.

There were about 200 children in the State who required treatment for the rare disease condition. Besides, there were only limited players in the manufacture and sale of the drugs for the condition.

In fact, ₹50 lakh had already been set apart by the Kerala Security Mission for the most deserving patients. The Union government could be directed to allocate necessary funds for treating the rare diseases, the government pleaded.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/central-govt-has-to-chip-in-for-treatment-of-rare-diseases-state/article30561078.ece

The stay order came on a petition filed by Cardinal Alencherry seeking to quash the criminal case.

The case had been registered against the Cardinal for the offences under Sections 406 (punishment for criminal breach of trust), 423 (dishonest or fraudulent execution of a deed of transfer containing false statement of consideration), and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) read with 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).

Private complaint

The criminal proceedings were initiated on a private complaint filed by Joshy Varghese of Perumbavoor.

The petitioner pointed out that Joshy Varghese had filed six other complaints against him before the Judicial First Class Magistrate, Kakkanad. According to Cardinal Alencherry, the complaints and the proceedings are nothing but abuse of the process of law with a view to harass him.

In order to tide over the financial liabilities of the Archdiocese, the decision was taken by the several bodies of the Archdiocese to sell the land.

168,2020/01/13,Wild ducks make a comeback to Wayanad,"The Wayanad wetland bird count that concluded here on Sunday recorded more than 1,200 birds belonging to 110 species, including 43 wetland exclusive birds.

The citizen science initiative tried to enumerate the resident and migratory waterfowl associated with the major wetland ecosystems of Wayanad such as the Banasura and Karapuzha reservoirs, Panamaram and Arattuthara paddy fields, as well as the Ammavayal and Golur waterbodies in the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary.

Census

The two-day programme, held as a part of the Asian Waterbird Census, was organised jointly by the Social Forestry Department, Wayanad, Hume Centre for Ecology and Wildlife Biology, and the Ratufa Nature Club of the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (CVAS), Pookode.

Key species that were recorded during the count included spot-billed ducks, common teals, whistling teals, river terns, and garganey, C.K.Vishnudas, conservation biologist, Hume Centre for Ecology, said.

Sighting of a red-crested pochard female in Karapuzha, a pair of oriental turtle dove, and pallid harrier at Panamaram were the highlights of the survey. Breeding of great cormorants was observed in the Banasura reservoir.

“Though small in numbers, the water bird count shows a trend of many wild ducks establishing gradually in the wetlands of Wayanad. Spot-billed ducks, common teals were rare in Wayanad some ten years back,” Mr. Vishnudas, who coordinated the survey, said.

“When the Karapuzha reservoir was commissioned, the shallow waterbodies close to the hills created an ideal habitat for waterbirds to thrive and breed. The population of swamp hens and jacana is showing an increasing trend along with common teals and whistling teals,” Mr. Vishnudas added.

Wetland ecosystems play a major role in maintaining water resources of a region and lifeline of agriculture production systems. The data generated from the event contribute to the global efforts to understand the changes in avian population in response to climate and ecosystem changes, he added.

C. Balusami, Dean, CVAS, Pookode, inaugurated the programme. A.Harilal, Divisional Forest Officer, Social Forestry, Wayanad, supervised.

Ornithologists R.L. Rathish and Roshnath Ramesh handled technical sessions on the importance of wetland birds, identification of birds, and bird evolution in the Western Ghats prior to the survey.

169,2020/01/13,Minister seeks State’s help for Sabari Rail,"Union Railway Minister Piyush Goyal has asked the State to share the cost of the Angamaly-Sabarimala railway project, aimed at putting the hill shrine into the railway network, as it is “not feasible for the railways to take the project forward solely with the railway funds”.

“The Railways cannot pay for the huge escalation in the project cost due to the inaction of the State government,” Mr. Goyal said in a letter on January 11 to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

As taking forward this project showing 512% increase in project cost solely with railway funds was not possible, the Minister said.

Sharing the cost will help the Railways the much required rail link for the travelling needs of the local people and the Sabarimala pilgrims.

Since September 2019, the Railways have kept the ambitious project in abeyance and decided not to infuse fresh funds due to the State’s non-cooperation. The 116-km line, sanctioned in 1997-’98, is one of the 10 ‘stalled’ rail infrastructure projects of the Southern Railway.

Protests

In the two-page letter, Mr. Goyal has pointed out the lack of cooperation on the part of the State government and local protests against fixing the alignment and land acquisition.

Till now, the Minister said work on the seven km-Angamaly-Kalady and the long lead works on the 10 km Kalady-Perumbavoor corridor had been taken up.

The estimate of the rail line had gone up from ₹550 crore in 1997 to ₹1,234 crore in 2005, to ₹1,566 crore in 2011 and now stands at ₹2,815.62 crore.

Though the Railways provided ₹225 crore in the 2017-18 budget, not much headway could be made. In the 2019-2020 Union budget, only ₹one core was given for the line.

Mr. Goyal has said the government of India requested the State to share at least 50% of the cost. The State agreed to it and the project was identified for execution on cost-sharing basis by the joint venture Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd. with the Railways.

Within one year, the Transport Department cancelled the government order issued for cost-sharing of the railway line citing it as a sanctioned project.

“It is surprising and against the interests of developing railways in Kerala and brought into question the State government’s commitment to this important project,” the Minister said.

The proposed line would have helped over 300 lakh Ayyappa devotees visiting the Sabarimala temple during the pilgrim season. As much as 470.77 hectares is needed for the line which passes through Ernakulam, Idukki, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/minister-seeks-states-help-for-sabari-rail/article30561000.ece

171,2020/01/13,"Supreme Court not to review Sabarimala case, to examine ‘larger issues’","A nine-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Monday said its objective was not to review the Sabarimala women entry case but examine “larger issues” of law like the prohibition of women from entering mosques and temples to genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohras and the banning of Parsi women who married inter-faith from entering the fire temple.

Instead, the Bench would examine the legality and essentiality of religious beliefs which prohibit women from entering into mosques and temples; which allow genital mutilation by Dawoodi Bohras; and which ban Parsi women who married inter-faith to enter the fire temple.

The Bench, however, clarified that it would not go into the legality of issues such as the practice of polygamy and ‘nikah-halala’ in Islam.

Chief Justice Bobde explained that the basis of the Bench's judicial enquiry would be seven questions referred to a larger Bench by a five-judge Bench on November 14, 2019.

On November 14, the five-judge Bench led by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, instead of deciding the Sabarimala review entrusted to it, sought an “authoritative pronouncement” on the Court's power to decide the essentiality of religious practices. Framing seven questions, the Bench referred them to a seven-judge Bench. These referral questions included whether “essential religious practices” be afforded constitutional protection under Article 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs).

Chief Justice Bobde, who succeeded Justice Gogoi, formed a Bench of nine rather than seven judges to examine these referred questions which concern multiple faiths.

On Monday, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the referred questions were too broad and needed fine-tuning.

Directive to lawyers

The CJI asked lawyers involved in the case to hold a conference on January 17 to reframe/add issues to be examined by the nine-judge Bench. The court posted the case for hearing after three weeks.

When lawyers sought to remind the court that the case challenging the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was scheduled for January 22 and the hearing before the nine-judge Bench ought to be heard without a break, the CJI said cases were being heard “chronologically”.

The CJI explained that the nine-judge Bench was only examining propositions of law raised about religious practices believed to be essential to various religions. The Bench would not go into the individual facts of the various petitions that make the body of the case before it.

“We will decide questions of law on women's entry to mosques/temples, genital mutilation by Dawoodi Bohras, entry of Parsi women who marry outside their community into fire temple. We will not decide individual facts of each case,” Chief Justice Bobde addressed the lawyers in the courtroom.

Senior lawyers’ contention

But senior lawyers like Indira Jaising and Rajeev Dhavan said the Supreme Court cannot decide on the essentiality of religious practices. It was outside its jurisdiction. “This Court cannot tell how religion is to be practised,” Mr. Dhavan submitted.

They drew the Bench's attention to the Shrirur Mutt judgment of the Supreme Court of 1954. According to the 62-year-old verdict, the essentiality of religious practices should be decided in accordance with the religious doctrines of each faith. The Supreme Court has limited power of judicial review, they argued.

The 1954 judgment held that any regulation could only extend to religious practices and activities which were economic, commercial or political in their character.

Lawyers even asked whether the numerically stronger nine-judge Bench was formed to test the Shrirur Mutt verdict delivered by a seven-judge Bench, which had reduced the court's role and left the question of essentiality of religious practices to the wisdom of religious texts.

“The only reason to refer this to a nine-judge Bench seems to be that Shirur Mutt was decided by a seven-judge Bench. But no one has questioned that judgment,” Ms. Jaising said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4298nv/article30537200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-intention-to-review-sabarimala-case-says-supreme-court/article30556499.ece

After inaugurating the family meet and adalat of Irikkur block panchayat Life Mission beneficiaries, he said the government was aiming at a homeless-free Kerala. When this government came to power, nearly five lakh households did not own a house, he said.

Two lakh families would be given house keys by the end of January. The second phase of housing would be completed by February. By March 31, all the beneficiaries would own a home, he said. Steps were being taken to make houses available to those who lost their homes during the floods.

Payam grama panchayat has started building 11 houses for the homeless. It was also planning to build 15 houses in Padiyur panchayat. Construction of two flats for fishermen had been completed, he said.

The Irikkur block panchayat had completed 609 houses under the scheme. Houses for beneficiaries in Payyaoor, Irikkur, Kuttiyattoor, Eruvessi and Malappattam panchayats had been completed. Work in Padiyur, Ulikkal and Mayyil panchayats was nearing completion, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/houses-for-all-life-mission-beneficiaries-in-3-months-says-minister/article30553179.ece
173,2020/01/13,Mission accomplished at Maradu,"In two precision explosions, demolition experts knocked down Golden Kayaloram and Jain Coral Cove, two illegal apartment complexes on the banks of Vembanad Lake on Sunday. Two complexes, H2O Holy Faith and Alfa Serene, were demolished on Saturday.

While Jain Coral Cove, which had the maximum number of apartment units, was demolished at 11 a.m. as planned, the demolition of Golden Kayaloram, the smallest of the lot, was delayed by 30 minutes because of delay in erecting a geotextiles curtain around an Anganwadi building. The complex that had 41 housing units came down at 2.32 p.m. Both the demolitions were by Edifice Engineering, Mumbai.

The two demolitions on Sunday were less riskier than those on Saturday as Jain Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram were located at sparsely populated areas. However, a house was located bang opposite Jain Coral Cove and Golden Kayaloram was sandwiched between an upcoming apartment complex and the Anganwadi building. The crumbling debris did not cause any significant loss to nearby structures and waterbodies.

The debris from Coral Cove fell four meters from the nearby lake, an extension of Vembanad Lake. All that the blasts left was thick plumes of dust, which dissipated in a few minutes.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/moktyf/article30552385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TVMARADUPAGE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mission-accomplished-at-maradu/article30552387.ece
174,2020/01/13,"Author narrates stories to children, on big screen","While their peers are mostly hooked onto cartoons and computer games, the students of Narayana Vilasam Upper Primary School, Anchal, are getting a chance to relish folk tales and fables exclusively curated for them. In a bid to revive the tradition of ‘Muthassi Kathakal’ the school has launched online storytelling sessions. The students were joined by Sumangala, one the most popular authors of children’s literature in Malayalam, for the first session.

The 84-year-old author narrated a string stories from her popular collections that include ‘Mithayippoti’ and ‘Neypayasam’ and answered their queries in an interactive session.

“We have been trying to inculcate a taste for literature in students and encourage creative writing. Nowadays, instead of narrating stories, parents use smart phones to entertain children. Listening to stories is an crucial for shaping their creativity and communicative skills. That prompted us to host such sessions,” says Manu Mohan, teacher.

Questions, answers

The award-winning author, who has to her credit a spate of top-selling books, was quite cooperative when the school authorities approached her.

A team from the school visited the writer currently residing in Thrissur for the online session, which the students watched on the large screens in their classrooms. Answering a student in the interactive session, she recounted her early days as an author and how she ended up publishing her first book in the 1970s.

Originally Leela Nambudiripad, she explained how she chose the pen-name Sumangala, taking a cue from the name of her ancestral home Deshamangalathu Mana. When asked about her advice to children, the author said all her messages were woven into her stories and she did not believe in pointing them out.

600 students take part

Around 600 students from Class 4 to Class 7 participated in the storytelling session. Though the school authorities had invited writers like Thulasi Kottukkal to share their experiences and insights with the students earlier, this was the first online session.

“We are taking up all possible measures to develop their literary skills. Our students have bagged prizes at revenue district arts festivals and many of them have published their works in Balasahithya Institute’s Thaliru magazine. This session could create a lasting impact among students and we are planning to make it a regular affair,” adds Mr. Manu.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/n2qf1z/article30552305.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tvko1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/author-narrates-stories-to-children-on-big-screen/article30552306.ece
175,2020/01/13,Residents see red over debris storage,"Local residents have expressed concern over the plan to bring debris of apartment complexes demolished through implosion at Maradu to a yard at Ezhupunna panchayat in the district.

Earlier, Aluva-based Prompt Enterprises had bagged the tender to remove the debris, weighing around 75,000 tonnes, for ₹35.16 lakh.

They identified three yards, Ezhupunna and Aroor in Alappuzha, and Kumbalam in Ernakulam, to store the debris till it is used for other purposes.

Before the demolition, the firm had brought some materials from the apartment complexes to yards last week. A few residents filed a complaint with the Ezhupunna panchayat against keeping debris there. The panchayat has since issued a stop memo to the firm.

Dust and pollution

Panchayat authorities said that people living near the yard in St. Raphaels ward were worried that the dumping of huge mounds of debris would cause high levels of dust and air pollution.

“The firm has taken a piece of land on lease. They have not yet sought permission from the grama panchayat for storing debris in the yard. In the meantime, we have received complaints from residents and the local body issued a stop memo to the private firm,” said M.K. Johnappan, vice president, Ezhupunna grama panchayat.

Firm’s response

Prompt Enterprises said they might not use the yard at Ezhupunna any further. “We had brought a few loads of plywood and other materials to the yard. However, we are not planning to use the yard for storing debris,” said Achyuth Joseph, partner of Prompt Enterprises.

Materials planned to be brought to yards mostly consist of concrete debris. Before transporting it to yards, concrete blocks will be cut using a rubble master crusher machine, imported from Austria.

Inspection in Aroor

Meanwhile, authorities with Aroor grama panchayat said that they had inspected the yard at Chandiroor. “A team led by the panchayat president visited the yard a couple of days ago after the firm brought some materials there. We have not received any complaints from the people there,” said K.R. Nandakumar, vice president, Aroor grama panchayat. He, however, said that the firm was yet to seek the permission of the local body to store debris in the yard.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/residents-see-red-over-debris-storage/article30552278.ece
176,2020/01/13,This is how Mehreen Pirzada pranked Dhanush while shooting for ‘Pattas’,"Including her upcoming film Pattas, she is three films old in Tamil. Yet Mehreen Pirzada is a virtual unknown for the movie audience here.

She could do little to help the situation. Her debut Tamil film, the Suseenthiran directorial Nenjil Thunivirundhal (2017), was all kinds of mess.

“Lots of things went wrong in that,” says Mehreen, over phone from Hyderabad. The film bombed at the box office, and, to add insult to injury, her portions in the film were chopped out after release to trim its run time.

Mehreen’s second outing was in a blink-and-you-miss type character in the Vijay Deverakonda film NOTA (2018), which too failed at the box office.

“Obviously, no one took the chance to give me a [second] break in Tamil. I’ve waited for the right chance, and I must thank Sathya Jyothi Films for bringing me back. They say patience is key... and now it’s like I’m back with a very big bang. I’m so glad that my comeback is opposite Dhanush sir,” she laughs.

Timing it right

For these reasons, the actor considers this re-launch to be her first film in Tamil.

Mehreen plays Sadhana in Pattas. “But she is nothing like her name. She is a very bubbly, naughty girl, and my scenes with Dhanush are really funny. I’m sure people are going to enjoy and laugh about it a lot,” she says.

Her character, then, would not be too dissimilar to her role as Honey from the 2019 Telugu blockbuster F2 — Fun and Frustration.

“Honey is one of the best characters I have played. It was widely appreciated by everyone. I think the producers saw the film and thought that I would be able to pull this role off really well. They wanted someone with a good comedy timing,” she adds.

Comedy is what she considers as her biggest plus. Emoting during dramatic scenes is another.

“I’m a very emotional, sensitive person in real life. I don’t require glycerine. Once I connect to a character or scene, I’d automatically have teary eyes,” she says. The 25-year-old does not mind admitting to her awkwardness as that which contributes to this comedy timing. “It is not that I intend to be funny... I’m the clumsy funny types,” she laughs.

Though she cannot speak the language yet, Mehreen says she has started to pick up Tamil better post Pattas.

“I speak fluently in Telugu now. I even dub for my movies. I’m sure as I start to do more and more Tamil films, I will pick up the language,” she remarks.

Working with Dhanush helped in this regard.

“I wanted to perfect my lines before he got to the set because I didn’t want to waste time. But he understood [when I got it wrong]. He is not that fluent in Hindi, and he told me it was like this when he worked in Bollywood. I would panic at times, but he’d calm me down. That way, the whole team really supported me,” she adds.

The prankster

Mehreen, though, cannot stop waxing lyrical about her co-star.

“He is a one take artiste. He is so good with his work. Between the words ‘Action’ and ‘Cut’, he does magic. He gives so many expressions in that timeline that it is overwhelming. You can learn so much when you work with such an actor,” she says.

Despite the admiration, when it was time to prank, the actor managed to pull a fast one over her senior co-star.

“We were shooting the ‘Jigidi Killadi’ song in Pondicherry. There is a scene where he is driving an Audi convertible, and Jani Master (dance choreographer) felt that it would be better if I drove instead of him,” she begins.

The scene in question was being shot in July 2019. When Dhanush looked at her to ask if she knew driving, Mehreen pretended to not know.

“I know driving but I don’t drive because I’m not very comfortable with driving... let’s put it that way,” she laughs.

When Dhanush heard this response, he looked disapprovingly at the choreographer, only for his request to be turned down. For her part, Mehreen too rubbed it in when she asked him which one was the brake and the accelerator pedal.

“He was like, ‘Oh my God! What’s happening? You don’t know anything’. So, he sat right next to the car door just so he could jump out,” she laughs.

“He kept telling me, ‘Mehreen, my life is very important. I have so much to do in life. I’m turning 36 in two days’. I was like, ‘Listen, my life is also very important. You have achieved so much. I have yet to, and I’m only 25’. It was funny,” she adds.

The actor’s Telugu film, Entha Manchivaadavuraa, too releases alongside Pattas on January 15. But she hopes to do more Tamil films.

“I love Chennai. The city really grows on you and how. I miss Chennai when I’m not there,” she concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hjob2m/article30559268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPMehreen-Pirzada-HQ-2-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/this-is-how-mehreen-pirzada-pranked-dhanush-while-shooting-for-pattas/article30559270.ece

178,2020/01/13,Voldemort vacations in India,"The Dark Lord is back! Last heard, he was strolling the streets of Puducherry.

Ralph Fiennes, who played the iconic role of the villain from the Harry Potter series and is also well-known for his roles in Schindler’s List, The English Patient and the James Bond films, was in Chennai, as well as the coastal town last week.

He has been creating quite a stir on social media, despite this being a deliberately quiet trip. Tipped off by a recent Instagram post by Villa Shanti, we ask around to learn that the actor checked into Palais De Mahe, Puducherry, on January 5 for four nights. Between sightseeing and visiting the Aurobindo Ashram, as well as the Indian and the French Quarter, the 57-year-old stopped by Villa Shanti for dinner on Wednesday night, where he posed for a picture with a staffer (below).

However, despite a trail of Instagram posts, these properties are tight-lipped about details.

Fiennes was also spotted in Hyderabad on this trip, checking out the former British Residency (now, Osmania University College for Women) which is undergoing restoration. A post uploaded by Historywallahs, a heritage travel company, shows the actor armed with a twin-reflex camera and backpack. Basav Biradar, founder of Historywallahs, says, “There is a chance that William Dalrymple’s White Mughals might be made into a movie, and that is why Ralph was there to see the place. He also seemed well-informed about Indian history.”

In Chennai, Instagram user @Simipoo12, who bumped into the actor at a city hotel, put up a photo with a caption that read, “When He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named tells you, ‘Come closer to Voldemort’, you have no choice but to accede.”

179,2020/01/13,Good content will net good collection: Sathya Jyothi’s TG Thyagarajan on Dhanush’s ‘Pattas’,"Over half-a-dozen SUVs greet visitors at the entranceway leading to the office of Sathya Jyothi Films in T Nagar.

The production house is abuzz with activity. For the firm’s chief, TG Thyagarajan, it is a regular day at work, though there is some cause for excitement as Pattas gears up for release on Pongal.

It is the second time in two years that a movie produced by Sathya Jyothi Films is hitting screens during the Pongal week.

In 2019, it was Ajith Kumar’s Viswasam; on Wednesday, movie buffs can expect to watch the Dhanush-starrer, Pattas, directed by RS Durai Senthilkumar, and which Thyagarajan expects would net the company a princely profit.

Good for business

Thyagarajan leads the way into his cabin, where his son, Sendhil Thyagarajan, also joins in for a conversation about Pattas, and its leading man, Dhanush.

Sathya Jyothi was in the news this time last year: for managing a blockbuster success out of Viswasam, and for signing Dhanush to a two-film deal. The news came in the backdrop of other actors like Jayam Ravi and Vishnu Vishal, to name a few, also signing multi-film deals.

Signing stars to multi-film deals may help shield the producer from the inflationary economics that Tamil cinema and its stars have long been associated with. However, Thyagarajan asserts that it was not a reason behind the Dhanush deal, but adds: “it is now emerging as a trend”.

“It makes sense for them (actors) in the long term to have a pipeline of projects with a quality production house,” Sendhil interjects, adding, “That is how it used to be in the 1980s, when dad and granddad (Venus Govindarajan) were making movies.” Besides Dhanush was impressed with the scripts (the second film is directed by Ram Kumar of Ratchasan fame) he had been offered.

Very little about Pattas’ trailer gives the impression of a “sports film”, but Sendhil insists it is one. “[Pattas] is about an ancient Tamil martial art called Adimurai. It is similar to Kalaripayattu, and was mainly practised during the Chola and Pandya era. This aspect is the premise, and so it is a sports film. We talk about MMA, but this kind of Tamil [martial] art also needs to get recognition. It is still practised in rural areas,” he adds.

Management basics

Pattas is the second time that the production company is collaborating with Dhanush, after Thodari in 2016.

The star kicked up a controversy last year after he commented, during a film promotional event, on the “difficulties” actors face in getting their dues settled from producers. The comment attracted sharp remarks from former office-bearers of the Tamil Film Producers Council, some of whom are Thyagarajan’s peers in the industry.

“He must have had an experience with some producers,” says Thyagarajan, while Sendhil notes that it need not necessarily be a common experience for all actors. “In the past decade, a lot of players have entered the trade, and they may not have planned or managed their finances well,” he adds.

There are plenty of tales of financial mismanagement in Tamil cinema, and most of the times, as cine industry observers argue, where it starts to go wrong is when negotiating the male lead’s salary.

From the time of MG Ramachandran to the era of Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan, Sendhil says that producers factored in a star's fan base (the sheer number of it) as a mile marker to calculate an estimate. Then, the quantum of business his past movies did is factored in.

“When grandpa did a film with MGR, he had about 38 lakh fans, which was around 15% of the population then. After Baashha, Rajini sir would have had 30 lakh,” says Sendhil.

While it was possible to have closer-to-accurate numbers in the bygone era, it is not the case anymore; producers, however, rely on figures thrown out by the Internet to help with the evaluation. For instance, Sendhil adds, “how many people logged in to watch a film’s teaser in the first one hour? These numbers give some indication.”

Aim for the star

The pre-sale factor is another aspect that determines an actor’s market value. “The stars, whose movies can be pre-sold... where people are interested in acquiring, and there is demand for satellite and digital rights, are bankable,” Sendhil says.

A good example is actor Vijay, and his upcoming film Master directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj. No teaser is out, and not even so much as an announcement over the release date has been made public, yet the film's domestic and overseas distribution rights have been sold, and at mind-boggling prices.

As far as Sathya Jyothi and Pattas is concerned, they have sold the satellite rights of the film to Sun TV whereas Amazon Prime is the digital streaming partner.

But this level of anticipation and demand creation, it would appear, is only possible when the film is backed by a star.

In Tamil cinema, it seems to be the way to attract footfalls to a theatre, says Thyagarajan, before adding a word of caution. “Content has got to be good... however big the star is. The collection from the first few days will come courtesy fans. Subsequently, it is the family audience who has to come to the theatres. That is when we see a good collection.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/z2lfq/article30557792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/horizontalwithoutjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/a-chat-with-producer-thyagarajan/article30557793.ece
180,2020/01/13,How Telugu concept-based cinema favours montage music,"The two Sankranti big ticket releases, Sarileru Neekevvaru and Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo, have drawn in huge crowds and given the audience a few hit song and dance numbers. ‘Mind block’ and ‘Dang dang’ from Sarileru... and ‘Butta bomma’, ‘Ramuloo ramula’ and ‘Oh my God, daddy’ from Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo are likely to be among the favourites for quite some time.

But not every Telugu film these days is packaged with song and dance numbers. The recent Mathu Vadhalara, for instance, was a concept-based film where the music score was blended into the narrative.

The past few years has a seen a steady decline in item dances and mass numbers in Telugu cinema, mainly because of the increase in content-based, realistic stories. New-age directors find it odd to include a duet in the middle of a serious narration. Even then we have the occasional low budget ‘Shambho Shiva Shambo’ song of Sampoornesh Babu in Kobbari Matta and the ‘Dimag Kharaab’ dance from Ismart Shankar that has the audience going berserk with the music and the moves.

The role of a dance master or a choreographer is very significant in promoting a song or a dance in the film. But films like Pelli Choopulu and other small films did away with the introductory dance of a hero and item number since it’s unnecessary in the story and doesn’t fit into the budget of the project.

This move by the directors is not without adverse effect. There are around 150 choreographers in Telugu film industry and 500 background dancers. The scenario is now bleak with many of them having less work. Dance master Anne says this change augurs well for the producer as they have to spend very little, but it is like a whiplash on the dancers and choreographers.

While some dance masters refrain from commenting, Anne sounds a bit hopeful. “There is a lot of competition here and there are only half a dozen choreographers; only the top names find work. Dances don’t fit into the stories any more and we have an active social media and critics questioning the necessity of a dance which comes out suddenly, disturbing the progress of the story. Earlier big hero films had five songs out of which one would be a montage number but now it is the reverse. So we have to be happy with one big dance from one big film and that will keep our kitchen fires burning for a month.”

Most of the big choreographers like Johnny, Raghu, Shekar, Anne, Bhanu and Vijay find work because the hero of that particular project demands his or her participation. It isn’t even a director, it is a hero who calls the shots as he says that only a particular choreographer can understand his skill or limitation and give the steps that they can handle.

On the other hand, woman dance masters like Anne rue that they never get item dances or mass numbers but are given only montages because it is perceived to be ideal for women choreographers. Montages spring from the imagination of director. If it is a small budget project he will do away with choreographers and conceive his shots but if it is a big budget project, he will hire a dance master to design a montage song too.

Director Harish Shankar has a different take. He says that all the choreographers and background dancers are busy with television shows and digital medium. Even concept films have choreographers and there is no reason for worry at all, he avers.

He points out unlike earlier, there has been an amazing increase of numbers in choreographers in Hyderabad. He says, “There is shortage of choreographers and dancers; there is rise in content and everyone is busy. Even montage shots need choreographers.”

For ‘Velluvocche Godaramma’ in Gaddalakonda Ganesh, Harish left no stone unturned and gave his best. Around 20 art directors were hired as the film had a retro feel and they got SP Balasubrahmanyam and P Susheela to sing the song once again to recreate the 80s mood. “We didn’t use contemporary techniques in camera too,” adds Harish.

Dance master Shekar agrees, “We did the song with a nostalgic mood, may be that’s the reason the song has become popular. For ‘Zara Zara’ song, we hired 100 dancers for five days and for the bindelu (water pots) song we took 80 dancers and 1000 bindelu whereas Raghavendra Rao roped in 10 dancers only.”

Many producers rope in dance masters from Mumbai presuming they are more talented and have technical knowledge. They come with six or eight assistants and charge a hefty sum. Yet the dances in Saaho drew flak from audiences and many industry insiders felt that a local choreographer could have understood the hero’s body language well and could have composed the steps accordingly. Also a local person will have a better understanding of the fan base. On the flip side, it is not fair to blame a choreographer. In most films, the hero gives instructions about what steps they can handle.

The story is different on the home turf. Some dance masters and newcomers compose dances for a paltry sum. The background dancers have no problem with the percentage system that is followed. If a choreographer comes from Mumbai or Chennai to Hyderabad they get a small percentage of their dancers while a majority is taken from here.

Shekar currently has plenty of work and is actually letting go of certain assignments because of lack of dates. People are bored with set songs and intro songs and new directors are always trying different stuff. According to him, dancers are busy, but there is certainly a problem because of montages. “Almost all the dances are designed by Hyderabadis and we have stopped hiring people from other states,” he says.

Prasanna, a choreographer from Chennai who works for Brinda master says it is absurd to blame directors for lack of work. Montage or a duet is based on the script. Only if there is a necessity for a song and a dance, we get work. Why would anyone need a dance master or background dancers for a film like 96 (The Tamil film now being remade in Telugu as Jaanu, starring Samantha and Sharwanand)?

“Earlier there were very few choreographers and they would travel across states to work for all language films. Now the scene is different, every State has its own choreographers and dancers who are turning into incredible talent.” says Prasanna.

183,2020/01/13,Life sentence for four in Kumbakonam rape case,"The Mahila Court, Thanjavur, on Monday, awarded life sentence till death to four persons found guilty of raping a woman in Kumbakonam on December 1, 2018.

According to police, the victim, a 27-year-old woman from New Delhi, arrived in Kumbakonam on the night of December 1 to attend a training programme as part of her job. She took an autorickshaw on Kamarajar Salai to reach the lodge, where she had booked a room. On the way there, she called a friend when she suspected that the vehicle was taking the wrong route. The autorickshaw driver asked her to alight from the vehicle on the bypass road. Subsequently, the woman started walking along the bypass road where she found two persons on a motorcycle and sought their help to reach her destination.

However, the duo took her to a secluded place on the Nachiyarkovil bypass road and called two other friends to come to the spot. All four sexually assaulted her and one of them took her in an autorickshaw from the Nachiyarkoil road to drop her at the place from where she was picked up. But when the vehicle reached the fish market area in the town, the youngster called up his friends on the mobile phone of the autorickshaw driver and asked them to come to the bus stand area. Later he alighted from the vehicle after directing the autorickshaw driver to drop the woman at a nearby lodge.

Upon alighting from the vehicle at the lodge, the victim noted down the autorickshaw number and next day morning she narrated the events to her friends. Subsequently, her parents were informed about the incident and they rushed in and lodged a complaint with the police.

The police identified the autorickshaw driver based on the vehicle registration number produced by the victim and later traced the four culprits – Dinesh (26), Vasanthkumar (23), Purushothaman (21) and Anbarasan (21) – and arrested them. Upon further investigation, the police had also identified the autorickshaw driver, Gurumurthy (26) who had picked up her from Kamarajar Salai near the Railway junction and left at bypass road earlier.

After hearing the case, the Mahila Court Judge, Ezhilarasi on Monday awarded life sentence till death to all the four accused and seven years of rigorous imprisonment to Gurumurthy for leaving the woman at an unsafe place.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/life-sentence-for-four-in-kumbakonam-rape-case/article30556872.ece
184,2020/01/13,Anna University tightens regulations for Ph.D. candidates and guides,"Anna University’s Ph.D. regulations have been revised and new rules have been included from this year. Research students will have to now do their first-year course work along with Master’s students. Ph.D. students will do their special elective programme along with regular students instead of ‘directed study’ with their research guides.

Earlier, Ph.D. students were allowed to take a break of up to two years but under the new norms, students will get only one year. Since the students get as much as seven years in the normal course to complete their Ph.D., it was decided that the two-year break rule would be dispensed with, according to professors.

The decision to do away with directed study was taken in order to to promote transparency, said K.P. Jaya, director for the Centre for Research. University professors felt that the move would also allow fellow students to assess the calibre of the research scholars, she said.

Another major change in the regulation is that during their course work, Ph.D. candidates should publish at least one research paper in a listed journal and must have a total CGPA of 7 to graduate. Earlier, it was 6.5. With the University adopting the Choice-Based Credit System format the grading had to reflect the flexibility it offered, officials said.

The Ph.D. regulations for 2020-21 will apply to students to be admitted from this academic year. The University admits Ph.D. candidates in January and July.

A forum of senior professors from the University, the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, and the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, besides a couple of principals of affiliated colleges, drafted the regulations.

“We should follow ethical practices. University faculty members are genuine but it is necessary to make the process transparent,” explained Ms. Jaya, about the changes.

The University has also tightened the rules for aspiring guides/supervisors. Only professors who have published at least five papers in peer-reviewed journals listed by the University can apply for guide-ship. Aspiring associate professors or assistant professors should have published three and two research papers each post their Ph.D. graduation to be eligible to guide research scholars.

Since 2013m the number of research students enrolling for Ph.D. has risen steadily. The University now has 1,200 Ph.D. students on its rolls. The new regulations were introduced at a meeting with research scholars of the University in December by Vice Chancellor M.K. Surappa.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/iydlcy/article30556020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13JANTH-ANNAUNIV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/anna-university-tightens-regulations-for-phd-candidates-and-guides/article30556021.ece
185,2020/01/13,"We are here to promote reading, not controversy: BAPASI secretary","The ongoing 43rd Chennai Book Fair was mired in controversy on Sunday following the eviction of a self-published author from a stall for displaying a book highlighting allege corruption in the Chennai Corporation’s Smart City project. In an interview, The Book Sellers’ and Publishers’ Association of South India (BAPASI) secretary S.K. Murugan defended the decision, claiming the organisation has never allowed anti-government books to be sold at the fair. Excerpts:

On what basis did BAPASI issue an eviction order to the tenant of a stall for displaying books critical of the state government?

Ever since Bapasi’s Chennai Book Fair started we have never allowed controversial books [to be sold]. Besides, publications are allowed to have a stall only if they follow the 25 rules framed by our association. Though the tenant [V Anbazhagan] agreed to this earlier, he displayed some controversial books. Hence we issued the eviction notice.

Why are you against the sale of books critical of the government?

We have this rule for the past 42 years. We are here to promote reading and we do not want any controversial or banned book to be displayed. Such books they can purchase outside too.

Your rule says banned and pirated books can’t be sold. But the books displayed at the stall have not been banned...

As I said earlier, we do not want any controversial books. Eight years ago, there was a book against the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. This was brought to our notice and we asked the publication to remove the book from the stall and he obliged. But Anbazhagan created a scene when he asked him to remove the books.

Why did you lodge a police complaint against him?

He was very abusive when we asked him to vacate and also when we turned down his repeated requests to have a book launch. The book fair is already crowded and the gap between two stalls is 15 feet. Hence it is impossible to have a book launch inside. The stage outside is used for launching the books of our members. Sometimes, we cannot accommodate their book launches too due to lack of slots.

Is it possible for BAPASI to ensure that no ‘anti-government’ book is sold at the fair when thousands of titles are available?

It is not possible considering the number of books. When the publisher enters into an agreement with us to set up a stall, it means he agrees to all the rules. We trust that he won’t have any controversial or banned books. If such books are displayed, the government agencies, readers or sometimes even police alert us and we ask them to remove them.

Doesn’t such censorship go against the freedom of speech and expression?

As long as we are in BAPASI, we are bound by its rules. We are not against them selling the books outside, but we prevent them from selling it in our fair.

Usually publishers object to governments banning books, but isn’t BAPASI resorting to censorship internally?

That is because Bapasi has a set of rules.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7lavnh/article30552911.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THBAPASIMURUGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/we-are-here-to-promote-reading-not-controversy-bapasi-secretary/article30552912.ece

The Maharashtra Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution recommending that the Centre add a separate column for Other Backward Communities (OBCs) in the census.

188,2020/01/13,"No rift with DMK, only aspirations of cadre conveyed: Congress leader","The statement issued by Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri and Assembly floor leader K.R. Ramasamy on Friday night accusing the DMK of not adhering to “coalition dharma” in the indirect elections to key posts to the rural local bodies was only an expression of the party cadres’ aspirations, according to Sirivella Prasad, AICC secretary in-charge of Tamil Nadu. In an interview on Sunday, he said there is no rift between the two parties and the alliance has broken the perception that ruling parties would sweep local body polls. Excerpts:

TNCC president K S Alagiri’s had accused the DMK of not adhering to coalition dharma. There have been voices in the TNCC that the party has not been given adequate representation in the local bodies pointing to a rift with the DMK...

It is not a rift. The cadres will have their own perceptions and aspirations. Those aspirations, as a party State unit president, Mr. Alagiri has to represent. He had given a statement in that context. Everybody should know that the cadres of parties will have some kind of expectations. That is what was communicated to the DMK, giving respect to the opinion of our cadres.

There is a feeling in sections of the TNCC that the seats should have been decided earlier by the high command of both parties, since the DMK district secretaries are seen as being more powerful in the local bodies. Do you agree?

There is a general practice in Tamil Nadu’s alliance politics when it comes to the local bodies, the district secretaries of the DMK and district level leaders of the other alliance partners have a say in the seat sharing. Depennding on the strength of the alliance, they decide internally. Here, we have to look at it as an entire alliance … we can’t see as different political parties. We have to see this as one political unit fighting the other political unit on different ideologies and their political commitments. That is how we need to look at the entire exercise.

Will you now have a re-look at the seat sharing strategy for the urban local bodies?

Definitely. Alliance politics is not new to Tamil Nadu parties and its leaders. For so many decades, they have been in alliance politics. They will learn lessons (from this) and strengthen the alliance and partnership. It’s not a two-party alliance. Everybody’s aspiration is to come to power.

There was cross-voting in the indirect elections and the AIADMK got an edge. Is it a negative for your alliance?

Indirect elections are a different kind (of elections). In local body elections, the general perception is that it is in favour of the ruling party. We broke that perception. The results are a clear indication of that. Cross-voting happens on local dynamics as well. But the major thing is that we broke the perception.

Definitely, it is going to be a positive factor for the coming Assembly elections. We can see the trend. I am confident that this is going to positively help us in the Assembly elections.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vd2qfu/article30552901.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THSIRIVELLAPRASAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-rift-with-dmk-only-aspirations-of-cadre-conveyed-cong-leader/article30552902.ece
189,2020/01/13,Bring down walls between people: Venkaiah Naidu,"There is a need to bring down walls that create differences among people now more than ever and follow the Indian tradition of Sarva Dharma Sama Bhavana which is part of Indian civilisation, Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu said on Sunday.

The Vice-President was speaking at the centenary celebrations of Sri Ramakrishna Vijayam, a Tamil monthly magazine brought out by Ramakrishna Mission here.

Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said: “We follow sarva dharma sama bhavana. People now talk about secularism, Constitution…Constitution came later. But religion, blood, respect for all religions — secularism does not mean irreligious, discrimination on the basis of religion, appeasement, insulting Hindus or this or that and all… it means sarva dharma sama bhavana and is part of Indian culture.”

“There are some people in this country who are allergic to the word Hindu. They have every right, but they are not right.” The youth should become ambassadors of the country’s heritage and culture. “India was known as Vishwaguru once upon a time and was in the forefront of knowledge creation and sharing it with people from all over the world. We believe in sharing our knowledge for the well-being of humanity as we treat the entire universe as one family - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. Share and care is at the core of Indian philosophy,” he said.

Mr. Naidu said Swami Vivekananda was a great saint, teacher and social reformer. “He played a major role in introducing Hinduism to the West”, he said.

Tribute to Vivekananda

Observing that everyone was born equal and there was no discrimination based on caste, he said Swami Vivekananda was a social reformer and opposed religious dogmas.

Swami Vivekananda believed in the uplift of humanity, irrespective of caste or creed and emphasised the importance of spiritualism for the survival and progress of mankind, Mr. Naidu said. Encouraging everyone to be physically fit, he said yoga was one of the ways to stay healthy. “But because Modiji has given yoga, some people say sir Modiji this that…Yoga is for body not because of Narendra Modi. Modiji has taken yoga to United Nations. Now the entire world is respecting yoga and are practising. Yoga is an ancient art, not done by Modiji alone,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/q57xwr/article30552894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THTNVENKAIAHNAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bring-down-walls-between-people-venkaiah/article30552895.ece

But V.O. Chidambaram Pillai (VOC), who was awarded a double life-sentence by the British court, was also a redoubtable Tamil scholar and prolific writer and had penned commentaries on Tirukkural and Sivagnana Potham.

Though his works were published separately by various publishers, VOC Noolagam, a Chennai-based publishing company, has compiled the entire work of VOC, and they will be published in two volumes soon.

“Today, politics and politicians are looked down upon by the youth because of the all-pervasive corruption. The life of VOC offers a ray of hope at a time when corrupt politicians, jailed for scams, are offered rousing reception,” said poet Ilayabharathi, founder of VOC Noolagam.

The two volumes running into 1,500 pages have an introduction written by Communist leader P. Jeevanandam and an obituary by Dravidar Kazhagam founder Periyar in Kudiyarasu.

“He lost his lawyer job, made many sacrifices, went to jail when there was no special classes in jail, faced huge losses and lived a poor life till his last days ….,” Periyar had noted. After his release from jail, he lived in Chennai, eking out a livelihood selling rice and ghee. It was while staying in Chennai that he plunged fully into a literary pursuit and taught Tamil to many people.

Besides his autobiography written in verse form, adhering strictly to the rules, the collection includes articles written by his contemporaries and others about him.

VOC also had a special interest in self-help books of James Allen and translated some of them when he was in the Coimbatore prison.

“Every Tamil should read his books and it should be translated into many languages,” he said in the preface.

V. Arasu, former head of Tamil Department, Madras University, who published 13 books of VOC, pointed out a problem in one of his works. “He wrote commentaries on the ancient literary work Innilai, an ancient literary work. Later, it was proved that it was a wrong book. He had received palm manuscripts of a different book,” he said, and stressed the need for removing the work from the collection.

For many years, commentaries on Book of Virtue (Arathupal) and Book of Polity (Porutpal) were available.

A visit to the office in Taramani shows the sorry state of affairs the team of the project is facing, while a swanky large new building of the International Institute of Tamil Studies remains mostly empty, housing only a few scholars.

A team of scholars visit the Directorate of Tamil Etymological Dictionary Project once in two weeks to discuss, deliberate and finalise Tamil words for various English terms across nearly all subjects.

The building is poorly lit, with books and old and broken furniture strewn around on the ground floor. A rather large landing and corridor space on the first floor also has old equipment and broken furniture thrown around. A source said toilets too were in bad shape and claimed that they were only recently fixed after the Director paid from his own pocket.

There is absolutely no maintenance being provided. They are not even fixing a bulb,” a source said. During rains, the building leaks and even the director’s room has to be mopped physically, the source said.

Thanga Kamaraj, director of the centre, said the government sanctioned ₹ 28 lakh to buy computers, “which is a very important project for the Tamil language”, as part of ₹ 1 crore sanctioned by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami.

He said due to the poor condition of the building the directorate was currently housed in, they did not spend it, as it would damage the equipment. “We have been asking for a new building for the past one year and the file is currently under process.

Minister for Tamil Culture MaFoi K. Pandiarajan said space had been allocated at Ezhilagam and 3,000 sq.ft was set aside with interior works under way.

But, a source in the know of the development said the Ezhilagam proposal was turned down long back. “The best option is to provide the centre space at the International Institute of Tamil Studies.

197,2020/01/13,‘Planting of exotics harmful to Nilgiris’,"A Coonoor-based trust proposes to plant more than 10,000 trees in the Nilgiris. But there is a problem: almost all of them are exotic flora — from avenue trees such as jacaranda and podocarpus, to pine and bottlebrush.

It highlights the growing trend among NGOs, social service groups and even celebrities looking to contribute towards the rejuvenation of the green cover in the Nilgiris.

Conservationists say that though the intention is commendable, the ill-thought out mass plantation drive, some conducted with the assistance of the district administration, will be harmful to the environment in the long term.

Dr. Tarun Chhabra, an environmentalist working on habitat restoration Nilgiris, said exotic trees such as pine, podocarpus and cypress trees have a huge impact on soil chemistry on the ground where they are planted, preventing native grass, plants and herbs from taking root underneath the canopy.

It has a knock-on effect on wildlife, resulting in their vacating the areas, he says. “Only native grasses should be grown in what were previously grasslands, or Shola trees should be grown where they existed previously,” said Mr. Chhabra.

N. Mohanraj, a Nilgiris-based ecologist, said growing exotic trees in the Nilgiris is counterproductive to conservation and ensuring biodiversity.

When exotics take root in a particular area, they increase the water demand in that region, impacting not just the Nilgiris but other districts further downstream that rely on rivers emanating from the hills.

Need for policy

The government should come up with a policy that stipulates that only native flora should be planted in public spaces in the Nilgiris because of its ecological significance and its unique biodiversity, say conservationists.

One of the justifications offered for the introduction of exotic trees is that they lead to better soil stability of the slopes on which they are planted. However, conservationists contradict this assertion. “The argument that exotics lead to soil stability is also fallacious, as the roots of these trees are very shallow, and the trees can get uprooted by high velocity winds and heavy rain, which characterise the monsoons in the Nilgiris,” said Mr. Mohanraj.

Nilgiris Collector J. Innocent Divya said the district administration had recommended to groups conducting plantation drives that only native species should be planted in the district.

“However, one of the issues they face is that the Forest Department has only enough native trees to afforest their reserve forests, so they do not give out any saplings to private individuals,” said Ms. Divya.

She said she had written to the Chief Conservator of Forests requesting a shift in policy that will allow for the Forest Department to supply native tree saplings to individuals and groups interested in afforestation.

Best practices

There needs to be a better understanding of the best ecological restoration practices that can be implemented when working in a landscape as crucial and sensitive as the Nilgiris, experts argue, stating that the Forest department too needs to rework its forest regeneration strategies.

Large-scale planting of exotics in ecologically-sensitive areas must be discouraged, said a senior Forest Department official.

“Shola tree species require a lot of maintenance post-planting to ensure their survival. Maintaining a Shola nursery is indeed very difficult as the trees are very slow in growing,” he said.

The priority of the Forest department is ensuring supply for their afforestation efforts in areas where exotics and invasive trees are removed,” he admitted.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bldwef/article30552569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THSAPLING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/planting-of-exotics-harmful-to-nilgiris/article30552570.ece
198,2020/01/13,Lifetime Achievement honour for Kapil Dev; Sindhu is the Sportstar of the Year,"P.V. Sindhu was adjudged the Sportstar of the Year and Kapil Dev honoured for Lifetime Achievement at the Sportstar Aces Awards here on Monday. Sindhu, who won a historic badminton World Championship gold in 2019, was also declared the Sportswoman of the Year (racquet sports) before an audience of some of the finest Indian sporting stars.

“When she was playing in the final of the World Championships, the streets in India were empty. That was wonderful to see,” noted Vijay Amritraj, who hosted a part of the ceremony. Sindhu, who is away in Jakarta for the Indonesia Masters, was represented at the event by coach P. Gopichand. “It was a great performance by her at the World Championships. This award will motivate her further during an Olympic year,” he said.

Kapil, who led India to World Cup victory in 1983, expressed his happiness through a heartfelt video message. “You feel happy deep down when people recognize your talent,” he said. “Every cricketer in our generation used to value The Hindu’s coverage. I also have lots and lots of Sportstar magazines [at home]. My wife has kept cuttings. When you see those pictures, it puts a smile on your face. My message to people in any field of life today is to be passionate in whatever they do. There is no Plan A and B. Plan B never works. Just work hard for Plan A.” Kapil’s award was received on his behalf by his first India captain, Bishan Singh Bedi.

Rohit Sharma was chosen the Sportsman of the Year (Cricket) for a hugely successful year, when he finished the top run-scorer at the World Cup while also making a roaring start to life as a Test opener.

“Sportstar magazine was a huge part of my childhood. I remember competing in the Sportstar Trophy during my U-19 days, and collecting Sportstar posters. It was so much fun. This award means a lot. I promise to continue to work even harder,” Rohit said in an audio message played to the gathering.

Yuvraj Singh, who accepted the award on Rohit’s behalf spoke of his appetite for runs. “It’s been a phenomenal year for Rohit. I remember when he came into the side he was a middle-order batsman. He still won a lot of games for India, scored seventies and eighties. Since he started opening, those seventies and eighties have become hundreds and double hundreds. He started to do really well [as an opener] in Test cricket this year, which was good to see. Hopefully he can smash some records in Test cricket like he does in one-day cricket,” he said.

Smriti Mandhana emerged the Sportswoman of the Year (Cricket), and was presented the award by Cricket Australia Director and former Australia women’s cricketer Mel Jones. “Last year was amazing for us in ODIs and T20s,” she said. “This year is exciting with the T20 World Cup coming up.”

The jury, which presided over all but two awards, was chaired by Sunil Gavaskar and also comprised N. Ram, Chairman, The Hindu Group, Viswanathan Anand, Aparna Popat, Anjali Bhagwat and M.M. Somaya.

The Chairman’s Choice Award went to Australian batsman Steve Smith for his remarkable performance in the Ashes, and was received on his behalf by Cricket Australia chair Earl Eddings. “We’re not chauvinistic; we recognize great achievements wherever they are made,” said Ram. “We honour him for his batting and his qualitative achievements of skill, courage and character on top of his famous — some would say obsessive — work ethic over the part year. Steve Smith came back from the cold from a life-changing and what at that time seemed a calamitous setback. In coming back he showed character by dominating the Ashes in England last year.”

N. Murali, Chairman, Kasturi and Sons Ltd., Ayon Sengupta, Editor, Sportstar, and K.C. Vijaya Kumar, Sports Editor, The Hindu, also addressed the gathering. The Indian Test team was declared the Team of the Year while Gopichand and R.B. Ramesh shared the Coach of the Year accolade.

199,2020/01/13,Dwayne Bravo recalled by Windies after a three-year T20 exile,"Dwayne Bravo was recalled to the West Indies squad on Sunday, more than three years after his last appearance as the Caribbean side build up to the defence of their World Twenty20 title.

The 36-year-old all-rounder, a two-time World T20 winner, was named in a 13-man squad for a three-match series against Ireland later this month.

However, the West Indies are thinking long-term with the next World Cup in the game’s shortest format taking place in Australia in October and November.

Bravo last played for the T20 side against Pakistan in September 2016 before he quit to concentrate on franchise cricket.

“Dwayne Bravo was recalled with the specific intention of bolstering our ‘death’ bowling, which was identified as an area that really needs improving,” said West Indies chief selector Roger Harper.

“His record in this department speaks for itself. He will also be able to act as a mentor to the other ‘death’ bowlers and lend his experience wherever needed,” he added.

Bravo has played 66 T20 internationals for West Indies, taking 52 wickets and scoring 1,142 runs. However, his career has often been controversial. He played the last of his 40 Tests in 2010 and was dumped as ODI skipper in 2014, after leading a walkout during a tour of India over a pay dispute.

Fellow all-rounder Rovman Powell has also been recalled having played 23 T20 internationals. Jason Holder, the team’s regular skipper, is being rested just as he was for the three ODIs against Ireland, a series which ended on Sunday.

200,2020/01/13,Bangladesh declines playing Test series in Pakistan,"Bangladesh has decided to stay firm in their decision to just play three Twenty20 internationals in Pakistan later this month, dismissing Pakistan’s proposal to take part in a full Test series.

Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Nazmul Hassan on Sunday said that the recent tension in the Middle East between Iran and the United States was the main reason behind the decision, as the government had given the board permission to send the team only for a short period.

“The current state in the Middle East is definitely different than other times. So considering escalating tension in that particular region, they (the government) have told us to keep the tour as short as possible,” Mr. Hassan told reporters in Dhaka after a meeting of the BCB board.

“They (government authorities) have told us to play the three Twenty20s as quickly as possible in a short period. Later, if the situation improves, we can play the Test matches. We are going to communicate the same thing to Pakistan Cricket Board,” he said.

According to the ICC’s Future Tour Programme, Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 internationals and two Tests in Pakistan in January-February.

The BCB had earlier made a similar proposal to play T20s in Pakistan, but the PCB had rejected their offer.

The PCB wants Bangladesh to play Test matches if Bangladesh are to make the series short as the two Tests are also part of the ICC Test Championship.

The BCB president said he will be flying to Dubai on Monday to discuss with ICC chairman Shashank Manohar about the possible implications of skipping the Test series against Pakistan.

203,2020/01/13,Civic problems put ruling party’s campaigners in a tight spot,"Inadequate supply of drinking water, incomplete roads and underground drainage works and poor sanitation would become a headache for TRS in the municipal corporation elections. As water under Mission Bhagiratha is yet to reach the city, many areas are hardly getting 20 to 30 minute water supply.

“We hardly get municipal water for 20 minutes and if we are late in waking up from sleep we will miss the water that day and must depend on water cans in the market. We cannot understand why we don’t get sufficient water even though there was excessive rainfall this year and reservoirs are full,” questioned housewives in Subashnagar in division No. 43.

Bad roads

As regards roads, some are in bad shape dotted with pits and potholes and some though laid newly, often are being dug out for different works disturbing the smooth flow of traffic. In certain areas the roads laid one-and-a-half decade ago are being used still. However, main roads like Hyderabad road, Armoor road and Bodhan road have been beautified with new dividers, central lighting system and plantations in the medians .

Mosquito menace

Slum dwellers are unhappy over the lack of basic facilities and pucca houses. On the other hand, mosquito menace is there all over the city and though the municipality is doing fogging the menace continues with open drains and garbage.

Since the sanitation staff often play truant, garbage heaps are getting piled up at some places and street corners.

As the households must keep the rubbish inside home until the garbage collectors come they have to suffer stinking smell. Garbage collectors often abstain from duty and in their place no one comes. “Alternative staff must be engaged on the day when the regular collectors take leave on emergency. However, there is no alternative arrangement,” averred, Mohammed Ikram Afsar, a retired railway officer.

204,2020/01/13,"Karimnagar Dairy increases milk price, diversification on the anvil","Telangana State’s leading milk supplier Karimnagar Dairy (Karimnagar Milk Producer Company Limited) has increased the price of toned milk by ₹ 2 per litre and pure milk by ₹ 3 per litre with effect from January 16.

On the other hand, the dairy also increased the procurement price for the benefit of milk producers. The buffalo milk with 1 kg fat content would be procured at ₹ 585 against old rate of ₹ 560 and the cow milk at ₹ 230 against ₹ 220. The farmer would be benefited by ₹ 1.25 paise per litre with one percent fat content in milk.

Disclosing this to newsmen here on Monday, Karimnagar Dairy chairman Ch Rajeshwara Rao said that they were forced to increase the milk price in the wake of increase in production cost with the hike in petroleum products, power tariff, plastic packaging material etc. The increase of milk price was not made for profits, but to benefit the milk producers (farmers), he maintained.

Giving details about their plans for the year 2020, he said the dairy was presently selling and procuring 2 lakh litres of milk per day. They has decided to increase the milk procurement and sales by 5 lakh litres per day and tap the potential in Hyderabad market where they were currently selling 40,000 litres per day.

New unit

In order to increase production, they had decided to extend the collection of milk from various other districts also. Presently, they were procuring milk from 14 districts of Telangana State, he said and added that they had decided to increase milk production from 10 other districts. Accordingly, they had decided to open additional 15 bulk milk cooling units against the existing 18 BCUs. As part of the expansion of Karimnagar Dairy with 3 lakh litres capacity, Mr. Rao said that work for the construction of new unit with state-of-the-art facilities began at Nallagonda village of Thimmapur mandal at a cost of ₹ 63 crore including ₹ 10 crore Central government grant.

205,2020/01/13,Rangolis add colour to TRS canvass,"In the run-up to the ensuing municipal polls, the ruling TRS is trying to harness rangoli, the traditional pattern, to pep up its election campaign as part of a carefully crafted poll strategy to emerge victorious at the hustings.

As many as five Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) including Madhira, Wyra and Sattupalli in Khammam district and Kothagudem and Yellandu in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district are slated to go to polls on January 22. Cashing in on the Sankranti festive spirit, the campaign managers of the ruling party are encouraging women cadres to draw rangoli in the form of ‘car’, the TRS party’s symbol in front of their homes to reach out to the electorate in a cost-effective manner.

Several enthusiastic women TRS cadres have embarked on a novel campaign by drawing their party symbol in exquisite rangoli patterns right in front of their homes in the poll-bound municipal towns as well as various other parts of the district.

An impressive rangoli in the shape of a car drawn by some women in Shanti Nagar in Khammam hogged the attention of the passersby on Monday.

Leaving nothing to chance to win Yellandu Municipality in the ensuing hustings, the TRS local leaders have drawn up plans to promote the election campaign through the popular art form of rangoli.

“Rangoli is the most popular traditional art that not only enlivens the environs surrounding homes but also serves as a powerful medium of expression,” says Dindigala Rajender, TRS senior leader and chairman of the Zilla Grandhalaya Samstha, Bhadradri-Kothagudem.

It is an amazing art that uses the floor as a canvas and deft hands, he notes, saying the TRS women cadres were gearing up to draw colourful rangolis in the shape of car, their party symbol at the doorways of their homes on Bhogi and Sankranti festivals to be held on January 14 and 15 respectively.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ftx09r/article30560907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14RANGOLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rangolis-add-colour-to-trs-canvass/article30560908.ece
206,2020/01/13,"KCR, Jagan agree on river water diversion","A six-hour long meeting between Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his Andhra Pradesh counterpart Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy on Monday ended in both of them reaching an understanding to divert water from Godavari river to ayacut in Krishna basin for optimal utilisation of river waters in the two riparian States.

It was decided that they will look in detail at the next meeting on the point from where Godavari will be diverted and places where the water will reach. How the water will be utilised and the model for the purpose will also be discussed, a release after the meeting said. Mr. Rao and Mr. Reddy met at the former’s camp office here and decided to adopt a give and take approach between the two States in all administrative matters. They asked the Chief Secretaries of their respective States over phone from the meeting hall to meet shortly to resolve pending issues of bifurcation of institutions listed under Schedules 9 and 10 of AP Reorganisation Act.

The release said the Chief Ministers had prolonged discussion over diversion of Godavari water to Krishna basin in the background of uncertain conditions every year over yield of water in Krishna.

It was noted that the yield was not uniform in Krishna each year. The water availability in the river was sparse several times. This was a loss to farmers in the ayacut of Krishna in Rayalaseema of Andhra Pradesh and Mahbubnagar and Nalgonda of Telangana. The crops in the basin do not get enough water. So, it will be wise to divert Godavari water which is in abundance to ayacut of Krishna whenever required.

While continuing to use Krishna water from Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar projects, the lands in this river basin could be supplemented with flows from the Godavari. It will ensure utilisation of Godavari water in a projected manner in less time and expenditure, Mr. Rao and Mr. Reddy felt.

As regards contentious issues between the two States in Schedule 9 and 10 institutions, they felt it can be resolved without difficulty with mutual cooperation and understanding. A needless controversy was raked up on them, they stated.

The meeting also discussed national and regional politics and various other issues concerning the two States. Mr. Reddy was accompanied by YSR Congress MPs Mithun Reddy, V. Vijaysai Reddy and V.

207,2020/01/13,PIL plea in HC over media disclosing victims’ identities in sexual assault cases,"A PIL seeking action against media organisations, which had allegedly disclosed the names of victims in sexual assault cases, has been filed in Telangana High Court here.

The petition, filed by an organisation called Forum Against Corruption, sought to declare inaction of the Police department and government to act against organisations which revealed identifies of victims in sexual offences, as illegal and arbitrary. Petitioner, president of the Forum Against Corruption Vijay Goel, said the over enthusiasm of electronic and digital mainstream media organisations was harming society and creating misleading perception about judicial system and procedures.

Disclosure of name and publishing photos of victim in sexual assault cases was of grave concern and the recent case of the rape and murder of a veterinarian was a classic example, the petitioner stated. He recalled a Supreme Court verdict which categorically ruled that no one was allowed to publish name or photographs of victims in sexual offences.

Sensationalism

Some non-registered and private websites, which claim to be reporting news by self-proclaimed journalists, were indulging in sensationalism by giving vulgar headlines to reports. They were resorting to this to get more clicks and make money through pay-per-click advertisements, the petitioner stated.

Mr. Goel contended that the apex court had in 2012 said that police must issue First Information Report without any delay whenever complaints about cognizable offences were received. In 2013, the Union government had issued an advisory that FIR must be issued whenever information about cognizable offence was received. Yet, the Telangana State Police Department had not issued any circulars to ensure these advisories or SC rulings were enforced, the petitioner said.

An offence

As per Section 228-A of Indian Penal Code, a person disclosing the identity of a victim in a sexual assault case attracts imprisonment of up to two years, the petitioner said. Not just disclosing name but even publishing any information suggesting or confirming identity of the victim in sexual offences constitutes an offence under this section, the petitioner said.

Mr. Goel stated that a complaint lodged by him with the Osmania University Police on alleged disclosure of the identity of a victim in sexual assault case by some news agencies and websites was pending for action. No action was initiated by the police on this complaint, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/o9iclx/article30562071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14HIGHCOURTHYDERABAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pil-plea-in-hc-over-media-disclosing-victims-identities-in-sexual-assault-cases/article30560519.ece
208,2020/01/13,BJP demands postponement of polls in Bhainsa Municipality,"The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday demanded a judicial probe into the communal incident at Bhainsa and also urged the State Election Commission (SEC) to take immediate steps to postpone the election to the municipality so as to ensure a free and fair poll at a later date as per the Constitution.

Telangana party president K. Laxman in a press statement strongly condemned the violent incidents and termed it a conspiracy by the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) and its ally All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) to fan communal trouble. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is squarely responsible for the law and order going for a toss in Telangana State, he said.

In a separate statement, party spokesman Krishna Saagar Rao condemned the “mindless violence” triggered over a “trivial issue” between two communities. He claimed that Telangana State is currently sitting on a landmine of communal hatred being fanned by the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) rallies being “freely allowed and even sponsored by the TRS and AIMIM”. Only a judicial probe into the violent incident will bring the perpetrators to justice, Mr. Rao added.

Memorandum to SEC

Earlier, in a memorandum submitted to SEC V. Nagi Reddy, senior leaders led by N. Indrasena Reddy claimed that the situation in the municipality is ‘fearful’ with houses and vehicles burnt and looting happening even as free movement of people has been curtailed. The tense situation and curfew like atmosphere prevailing there “is not at all conducive for a conduct of a free and fair poll”.

Though Sec.144 has been imposed, the meagre deployment of police is unable to control the situation, they claimed. Party leaders including MPs D. Arvind, S. Bapu Rao, MLC N. Ramchander Rao and others are not being allowed to visit Bhainsa for campaigning, hence the need for putting off the election, the memorandum said.

Later, at a press conference former MLA N.V.V.S. Prabhakar and others appealed to the SEC not to permit anti-CAA rallies across the State as they are “fanning communal trouble”. He charged the AIMIM of playing the communal card in sensitive towns with the help of ruling TRS. The pink party has been only poaching Congress Party candidates for the municipal polls and in any case, there is not much difference between both the parties, he claimed.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-demands-postponement-of-polls-in-bhainsa-municipality/article30560356.ece

The town constitutes a mix of communities, including a large number of working class, while the minority community accounts for an estimated 40 % of its population of 65,000. The varied mix of people and the labour intensive cotton industry, however, have never been the guarantee of peace for the residents here.

Bhainsa has seen a few communal incidents in the past which has put it on the map of communally sensitive places in the country.

First event

The first of the communally violent incidents in this town is traced to holi festival celebrations in 1984 when two dominant communities clashed.

The second incident took place in 1996 during the Ganesh immersion festivities. The town witnesses robust celebrations of festivals which also makes it vulnerable for violence.

The last major incident of communal violence took place in October 2008. Violence had broken out during the Durga Devi immersion procession which had left three dead but worst was to come a couple of days later.

Horrific repurcusions

In the sleepy village of Vatoli in Bhainsa mandal, six of a family, including three children were burnt alive on October 12 as a sequel the two-day-old incident. This incident had sent shock waves across the then undivided Andhra Pradesh.

“We demand postponement of the election as the conditions are not conducive. People are living in fear of reprisal of the violence if election is held,” observed BJP MLC N. Ramchander Rao at a press conference at this communally sensitive town on Monday.

Police curbs

Mr. Rao and Adilabad MP Soyam Bapu Rao had arrived at the town in the afternoon intending to visit the riot affected area and call upon the injured persons in the hospital. The police, however, prevented them from doing so.

Citing their reasons for seeking deferment of election, the BJP leaders said the TRS has withdrawn its candidates from two councillor seats making it convenient for the Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen to get elected unanimously.

“The TRS is likely to withdraw from five more seats which is against the principles of healthy contest,” they contended.

The two leaders accused the government of failure in containing violence.

211,2020/01/13,Uneasy calm in Bhainsa town after communal clash,"Uneasy calm prevailed in the communally sensitive town of Bhainsa in Nirmal district on Monday, after the communal volence of the previous night. Sporadic incidents of stone pelting and one of arson, which was actually restricted to an area not more than 200 metres in radius, disturbed the peace during the day which had seemingly been restored by the presence of a large number of police force deployed since the wee hours.

Two groups belonging to different communities were involved in a bout of stone pelting, arson and rioting late on Sunday night. The town observed a bandh even as prohibitory orders were imposed and internet services withdrawn on Monday morning.

Violence took place in the narrow bylanes of Korbagalli and Bhoigalli which left 11 civilians injured. Also injured in the incident were Nirmal Superintendent of Police C. Shashidhar Raju, Bhainsa DSP Narsing Rao, Inspector Venugopal Rao and Mudhole SI Ashok among others, while controlling the violence.

Property damaged

The damage to property in arson included burning of 12 houses, 24 motorcycles, of which 20 were burnt fully, one car, one auto and a pickup van burnt partially, according to Inspectors-General of Police Y. Nagi Reddy of North Zone region and P. Promod Kumar.

Apart from three companies of Rapid Action Force, some 400 policemen and officers including Ramagundam Commissioner of Police V. Satyanarayana and Siddipet Commissioner of Police Joel Davis, Adilabad SP Vishnu S. Warrier, Kamareddy SP Shwetha Reddy and Rajanna Sircilla SP Rahul Hegde were on duty to help bring back normalcy.

Noisy skirmish

The incident in question had taken place around 11 p.m. on Sunday when locals of Korbagalli allegedly objected to a trio belonging to one community disturbing peace in the night as they zoomed past on their noisy motorbike repeatedly through the narrow bylane.

The youths came back with scores of members of their community and indulged in stone pelting, arson and rioting leaving the residents of that locality dazed and scared, according to an eyewitness, Dabulka Mohan of neighbouring Bhoigalli who had his two motorcycles burnt down by the attackers.

Police attacked

The police which tried to bring normalcy to the situation had stones pelted upon it resulting in injuries to many of them. While some suffered bleeding injuries many received minor ones which required first aid.

While all concerned including the residents of the area and the police spent a sleepless night, morning saw angry locals gather close to the property which was burnt.

Miscreants from the opponent side also gathered in the narrow bylanes and kept pelting stones on the policemen injuring a couple of constables and a home guard.

Hunt on for culprits

“We have formed teams to identify the culprits. They will soon be taken into custody,” the top police officials told The Hindu about measures being taken to restore confidence in local communities.

Meanwhile, almost all internet service providers suspended their services across old undivided Adilabad district. This was done on the request of authorities so as to restore normalcy at the earliest.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ii1sip/article30561650.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14BHAINSAPELTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bhainsa-tense-after-communal-clash/article30559868.ece

The SEC directed the officials concerned to take up awareness campaign to educate people about the need to exercise their franchise in the forthcoming elections to 120 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations across the State.

Elections to all but Karimnagar Municipal Corporation are slated to be held on January 22 and the last date for withdrawal of nominations is January 14. Election for Karimnagar corporation would be held on January 24 and the results would be declared on January 27. With Tuesday being the last date for withdrawal of nominations in a majority of the ULBs, Mr. Nagi Reddy reviewed the arrangements that had been made for the polls.

Symbol allocation

He wanted the officials concerned to exercise adequate caution while allocating symbols to the contesting candidates and verify the information pertaining to the candidates printed in the ballot papers. The municipal commissioners on their part should take steps to publish ward-wise voters’ lists in areas where the exercise was yet to be completed.

Steps should be taken to ensure that voters carried any one of the prescribed identification cards with them while entering the polling stations. The second phase of training to the officials drafted on polling duties should be completed at the earliest while the officials concerned should hold meetings with the police officers to finalise the security arrangements that should be made at the polling stations.

219,2020/01/13,"From Shaheen Bagh to Shanti Bagh, anti-CAA stir spreads","As the ongoing protest at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh against Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens grabs national media attention, a similar dharna at Shanti Bagh in Gaya district of Bihar enters 16th day, with hundreds of protesters from all sections raising their voice against the law and the proposed exercise. Like Shaheen Bagh, the protesters here speak fearlessly, enlivening the bitter winter chill with a spring of dissent.

Under the banner of ‘Samvidhan Bachao Morcha (Save Constitution Forum)’, the protesters have pitched a large tent on an open ground at Katari Hill Road in Shanti Bagh. Huge cut-outs of Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar have been put up on both ends of banners hung at the front and the rear side of the venue. On the right, a wooden platform has been erected and a microphone has been installed on the podium along with a Tricolour. Posters with slogans like “we need humanity, not brutality”, we’re Indians, don’t divide us”, “we reject CAA, NRC and NPR” adorn the venue. A copy of the Constitution and a donation box have been put up near the stage. Red plastic chairs are arranged neatly for those visiting the venue in the evening and at night — all under CCTV surveillance. The cameras have been installed by the protesters to prevent any untoward or uncalled for activities by unidentified troublemakers.

‘Peaceful protest’

“Today is the 16th day of our peaceful protest. It will continue until the government withdraws the CAA, NRC and NPR. On Sundays and Fridays, the crowd crosses 10,000. All are coming voluntarily,” said Omair Khan alias Tikka Khan, the convener of the forum. On January 12, the ground was packed with people, mostly women, he added. Mr. Khan and his friends Wasim Nayear Ansari, Faiyaz Khan, Satish Kumar, Abdul Quadir, Manoj Kumar and Ishtiyaque Ahmed formed the forum on December 14, 2019 to oppose the CAA, NRC and NPR and two weeks later, on December 29, they began their peaceful, indefinite protest at Shanti Bagh.

“On the first day, we were only seven-eight friends here, but as the days passed, the number of participants also rose. Now every day, more than 1,000 people, from children to senior citizens, turn up to express their solidarity,” said Mr. Ansari.

“The CAA, NRC and NPR would divide us along religious lines. We will not stop our peaceful protest until the government rolls back these discriminatory policies,” said Nusrat Hassan, a schoolteacher, and Fatima Khan, a cosmetics businesswoman, who have been sitting on dharna along with others.

Funds from donations

How have they managed the 24X7 protest for so long? “We have put up a donation box and people coming here are giving money. On an average, we collect about ₹6,000 per day but the amount goes over ₹10,000-₹15,000 on Fridays and Sundays. It’s increasing everyday,” said Satish Kumar, a veteran social activist. At night, they recite poems, azadi songs and engage in debates and discussions over CAA, NRC and NPR. Students stage plays to send across their message.

The protesters begin their day by reading the Preamble of the Constitution and end their day at 10 p.m. with the national anthem. “To avoid any inconvenience to the local people, we switch off our mic at 10 p.m.,” they said.

“Several leaders from different parties, except BJP and JD(U), have come to express their solidarity with us. We have also invited former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar, political activist Yogendra Yadav and others to address us in the coming days,” said Mr. Khan.

What next? “We have planned to visit remote blocks and areas in a group to make people aware about these discriminatory and divisive policies. We have already visited Imamganj, Sherghati and Mohanpur blocks of the district and will cover Belahanj and Guraru in the coming days,” said Mr. Ansari. “We will not quit,” they asserted.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/s18u2q/article30561588.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13-GAYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/from-shaheen-bagh-to-shanti-bagh-anti-caa-stir-spreads/article30561590.ece
220,2020/01/13,‘It undermines the position of DM’,"The implementation of the commissioner system has evoked mixed response from former officials and teachers of public administration. Considering many districts in the State are going through a law and order situation in the wake of anti-CAA-NRC protests, the decision acquires all the more significance.

Harsh Mander, who worked in the Indian Administrative Service before turning to social activism, said it undermines the position of the District Magistrate, particularly in a law and order situation. “My experience as a District Magistrate suggests that the dual system provided for a check and balance at the district level,” he told The Hindu.

Retired super cop Maxwell Pereira said the commissioner system is known for providing “quickness of action” but it makes a single authority responsible for action, good or bad.

Mirza Asmer Beg, who teaches public administration at Aligarh Muslim University, said quickness of action is crucial when you are fighting a “foreign enemy” or providing civic amenities. “Not when you are up against your own people exercising their democratic right to dissent.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/it-undermines-the-position-of-dm/article30561516.ece

In the preliminary examination, one of the questions, based on a passage on the tribe, read: “The primary reason for the criminal nature of Bhils is”, with the four options as “inability to pay liabilities”, “working with honesty”, “carrying out immoral work” and “migrating from villages”.

222,2020/01/13,U.P. govt. gives more power to police,"The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday passed a proposal to introduce the police commissioner system in two major cities under which IPS officers would get additional authority including magisterial powers.

This comes in the wake of violence during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and allegations of police brutality and use of excessive force against protesters.

The proposals were passed by the State Cabinet headed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The police commissioner system would be implemented in Lucknow and Gautambuddha Nagar.

Sujeet Pandey, a 1994-batch IPS officer and ADG Prayagraj, was appointed as the new and first ever police commissioner of Lucknow. I-G Naveen Arora will be joint commissioner (law and order) and Nilabja Chowdhury, also of the same rank, will be joint police commissioner (crime and headquarters) in Lucknow.

The system would be slightly different in Gautam -buddha Nagar. While Alok Singh, 1995-batch IPS officer and ADG Meerut Range, will be the police commissioner Gautambuddha Nagar, the city would have two additional police commissioners, Sriparna Ganguly and Akhilesh Kumar, of the rank of DIG.

“In police commissioner system, police works as a team, under which the police commissioner has some magisterial powers in order to take forward smart and effective policing,” Mr. Adityanath told reporters after the Cabinet meeting.

As per an official statement, the government listed several reasons for introducing the police commissioner system including the hi-tech nature and complexity of crimes, organised crime menace like drugs and human trafficking and cyber crimes. While the government does not directly link the introduction of the police commissioner system to the recent protests, it evaluates the present system of crowd control as inadequate to prevent damage to public property.

“Law and order challenges have become such that for crowd control and to effectively prevent vandalism of government and private property, the present system is proving to be weak,” the government document said.

This point stands out as the State government recently issued notices to around 500 persons across U.P. asking them to pay hefty fines for the damage to public and private property in the violence that took place during the protests against the CAA. The notices were issued after Mr. Adityanath vowed to “take revenge” against alleged vandals by confiscating and auctioning their property as compensation for the damages.

Historic day, says CM

Mr. Adityanath said the decision marked an “important and historic day” for policing in U.P., adding that introducing the police commissioner system was the “biggest step towards police reform” in the State.

DGP O.P Singh welcomed the decision as a necessary step towards taking quick action and said “with this comes greater responsibility to deliver.”

223,2020/01/13,Akali Dal accuses Congress of bid to weaken the party,"The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday hit out at the ruling Congress, accusing it of attempting to weaken the Akali Dal, a day after Congress Ministers had termed the party as personal fiefdom of the Badals.

SAD leaders Balwinder Singh Bhundur and Prem Singh Chandumajra, in a joint statement said the way in which Congress Ministers had jumped into the fray to help MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his son Parminder Dhindsa (both suspended from SAD) proved that they were being used as pawns by Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh in an attempt to weaken the ‘Panthic’ party after failing on all fronts.

The Shiromani Akali Dal last week had suspended rebel Rajya Sabha MP Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa and his son former Finance Minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa for “anti party” activities.

“Now with Congress Ministers taking on the job of spokespersons for the Dhindsa family it is clear that they are working as per a fixed game plan in collusion with each other. The cat is out of the bag. The Dhindsa faction, which consists of Mr. Dhindsa, his son Parminder and son-in-law Tejinderpal Singh Sidhu only, are being supported by the Congress with the sole aim of splitting Panthic votes,” said the leaders.

“In the first list, over 32,000 refugees have been identified in 21 districts of the State and the exercise is going on in the entire State as per information I have from the State Home Department,” he added.

There are 75 districts in the State.

When asked about the countries they belong to, Mr. Sharma said, “they are from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.”

225,2020/01/13,Woman ostracised for going to court in Odisha,"A woman and her family have allegedly been ostracised for seven years in Odisha’s Puri district for opting to go to court, defying her village’s diktat, to settle a dispute over her engagement as an anganwadi worker.

Villagers, including her own parents staying in Bhatapada village under Brahmagiri block, have stopped talking to her in public due to an unwritten decree since 2013, said Bhanumati Pradhan, who along with her husband and children were forced to migrate from the village.

In 2007, the State government had issued an advertisement for a vacant post of an anganwadi worker, offering a monthly remuneration of ₹1000. A government panel had found her suitable for the post among the short-listed candidates. Three months later, the government came up with revised guidelines for the post and due to the changes, Kanchanmani Jena, another candidate, was selected and issued an engagement letter.

Ms. Pradhan challenged the government order, both at the District Collector’s office and the Orissa High Court, stating it was illegal to come up with guidelines when the selection process was almost complete. In 2012, the High Court ruled in her favour. This did not go down well with the villagers who reportedly wanted Ms. Jena to continue. The villagers refused to receive food from Ms. Pradhan, as a result of which her engagement as an anganwadi worker did not last long.

The case is now pending before the Supreme Court after another candidate challenged the High Court order in the apex court.

“I was pressurised to withdraw my claim over the post. On failing to do so, my family would have faced social boycott. I had agreed to withdraw the case in lieu of ₹60,000 I had spent for fighting court cases. But, the villagers wanted the case to be withdrawn immediately,” Ms. Pradhan said.

“When the agreement collapsed, my in-laws were socially boycotted. Since 2013, my in-laws have not been getting any help from the villagers,” she said.

The local police is said to have gone to the village to broker peace. But, the police remain tight-lipped about the issue.

“Even after so many years of independence, khap panchyats continue to exercise their authority. People’s representatives and law enforcement agencies must be sensitised on the issue. A new legislation must be thought to make social ostracisation punishable,” said Bibhu Prasad Tripathy, a senior Orissa High Court counsel.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6wtxhe/article30561457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bhanumati-Pradhan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/woman-ostracised-for-going-to-court/article30561458.ece

Speaking in the Assembly, Mr. Kumar said his government agreed in principle to the National Population Register like it did 10 years ago when the exercise was last undertaken.

He also emphasised that caste names be included in the census when it is done.

“It (the NRC) would be needless (koi zarurat hai nahin) and have no justification (koi auchitya nahin). And I think the Prime Minister, too, has spoken clearly on this,” he told the House, while thanking it for unanimously ratifying the Constitution amendment for extending quotas for SCs and STs in Parliament and state assemblies by another 10 years.

About the CAA and the National Population Register, he said he was agreeable to having a debate in the Assembly.

“This session has been convened for a specific purpose. However, there is a lot of turmoil over CAA, NRC and NPR. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that there should be a discussion on these,” he said.

227,2020/01/13,JNU protests no longer justified as fee hike issue resolved: HRD Minister,"The students agitation at Jawaharlal Nehru University “is no longer justified” as their key demand related to the hostel fee hike has been dealt with, Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank said on Monday, calling for an end to the protests which began almost three months ago.

“After rounds of discussions, JNU has issued a statement that the students are not being asked to bear the cost of service and utility charges proposed for the winter session, which was their basic demand,” said an official statement from the Ministry. “Therefore, the JNU fee hike issue stands resolved since this was the main demand of the students.”

Mr. Nishank said the “continuation of agitation by the students is no longer justified”. The statement said institutions of higher education should not be converted into political arenas, adding that over 5,000 students have already registered for the winter session.

Students and faculty have pointed out that other demands, including those which were mutually agreed upon during negotiations helmed by the Ministry last month, have still not been met.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jnu-protests-no-longer-justified-as-fee-hike-issue-resolved-hrd-minister/article30561107.ece
228,2020/01/13,All Assam Students’ Union leaders skip meet with Shah,"Leaders of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU), one of the signatories of the 1985 Assam Accord, skipped a meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday.

Four members of a high-level committee for implementation of Clause 6 of the Assam Accord, which provides for constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards to protect, preserve and promote the culture, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people met Mr. Shah in Delhi.

Report soon

The 14-member panel headed by retired Gauhati High Court judge Biplab Kumar Sarma, also tasked with finding out who is an ‘Assamese’, is expected to submit its report by January 15.

The AASU leaders — chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya, president Dipanka K. Nath and general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi — decided to stay away.

“It is the government’s bounden duty to implement Clause 6, but it is virtually being bartered to offset the anger in Assam against the unconstitutional CAA. Implementing this vital clause of the Assam Accord will not be proper if the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is also in force,” Mr. Nath said.

The committee is also expected to recommend reserving Assembly seats for the indigenous communities of Assam.

“We have apprised the Home Minister of the progress of our work. He has given a few suggestions. We hope to submit our final report within the next 15 days,” Mr. Sharma told presspersons.

Asked whether the panel could finalise the “definition of Assamese”, the retired judge said the members were yet to take a decision on it and hope to come to a conclusion soon.

“All members of the committee will soon meet to finalise the report and all remaining issues will be resolved,” he said. The meeting took place four days after Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal met Mr. Shah and discussed with him various aspects of Clause 6, under which the Central government had promised to provide constitutional safeguards to the indigenous people.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/g43sed/article30560652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14AMITSHAH1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/all-assam-students-union-leaders-skip-meet-with-shah/article30560653.ece
229,2020/01/13,AMU students boycott classes,"Aligarh Muslim University’s (AMU) students of Medicine, Unani Medicine and Management Sciences on Monday boycotted classes as these faculties reopened after an extended winter vacation. They demanded that the Vice Chancellor and the Registrar, taking responsibility for the police violence on the campus on December 15 last, should resign.

Classes of the engineering college remained officially suspended. End semester examinations in the college are scheduled from January 16. “Around 300 students of different streams gathered on the lawns of Kennedy Auditorium to decide the future course of action. It was resolved that all academic activities, including examinations, will be boycotted till the resignation of the Vice Chancellor and the Registrar,” said Qudratullah Faraz, a student of Electrical Engineering.

Official sources said only 30-40 % students have returned to hostels after the vacation.

Student activists Snehashish, Sabah Maharaj, Shayma S and Sadat Hussain from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) visited AMU and addressed the students at Bab-e-Syed.

Targeting those who are labelling protests as communal, Maharaj said, “Any marginalised community fighting for its rights is labelled as communal.” Referring to this history of 'otherisation' of Muslims in India, Shayma said, “Muslims are always treated as a suspect community”. Giving the example of the attack on JNU students and teachers on the evening of January 5, she said, “Muslims and Kashmiri students were specifically targeted even in JNU.”

Teachers’ march

Meanwhile, on the call of Aligarh Muslim University Teachers’ Association (AMUTA), scores of faculty members took out a peaceful march against the CAA/ NPR/NRC. “The AMUTA stands behind the students of AMU fraternity, and would collectively defeat injustice by taking all measures within the jurisdiction of law,” said Najmul Islam, its honorary secretary.

On Sunday, social activist Medha Patkar addressed a gathering of resident doctors of Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College on the CAA-NRC. She told reporters that the current dispensation was busy undermining the fundamental principles of the Constitution. She visited student Mohd Tariq, who allegedly lost his palm in the police action on December 15.

230,2020/01/13,Rajasthan lawyer alleges torture by U.P. police,"A 25-year-old Muslim lawyer from Rajasthan’s Kota district on Monday accused the Uttar Pradesh police of falsely implicating him in a case for protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and of torturing him in custody. The lawyer, Mohammed Faisal, spent 14 days in jail at Kairana in U.P. before he was released on bail on January 7.

Mr. Faisal, a practising advocate at the Kota district courts, had gone to Kairana in Shamli district last month as a member of the National Confederation of Human Rights Organisations (NCHRO) to offer legal aid to the protesters arrested during the agitation against the CAA.

The U.P. police, however, allegedly arrested him from the court premises when he was completing formalities for bail applications on behalf of some accused persons.

Speaking at a press conference in Jaipur, Mr. Faisal said a team of U.P. Police’s Special Operations Group forcibly took him, along with three others, to the Kotwali police station in Kairana on December 23.

“I was outside the Sub-Divisional Magistrate’s court with a local lawyer doing the paper work for bail applications for some persons who were picked up from their houses five days before,” he said.

When Mr. Faisal told the policemen that he was a lawyer and showed them his identity card, they dismissed it as a fake document and claimed that he had come to Kairana to “incite violence”.

“They said I was speaking with a Bengali accent and alleged that I had come from West Bengal to provoke the people and help the rioters.”

The lawyer alleged that the policemen abused him, thrashed him, beat him with sticks and tortured him by giving electric shock on his back inside the police station. The police then put him in the lock-up and arrested him in a criminal case in which 700 other unidentified persons were also named as accused. He was produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate the next day.

The case was registered under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between groups on grounds of religion, etc.), 143 (unlawful assembly), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code.

Member of the Bar Council of Rajasthan (BCR) Shahid Hasan said the body would write to the Chief Justice of India, Chief Justice of Allahabad High Court, National Human Rights Commission and the U.P. Chief Minister, seeking their intervention in the matter. Mr. Hasan said the BCR would seek action against police officials who had booked Mr. Faisal in the “concocted case”.

NCHRO-Rajasthan president T.C. Rahul said Mr. Faisal had gone to Kairana on the Confederation’s instructions amid the reports of large-scale illegal arrests and harassment of innocent people in Shamli district. PUCL State president Kavita Srivastava said Mr. Faisal’s arrest amounted to infringement of his own right to defence as well as his right to defend others.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-lawyer-alleges-torture-by-up-police/article30559604.ece
231,2020/01/13,"In Assam, appeals to burn CAA copies at Bhogali Bihu bonfires","Assam’s mid-January festival of feasting is expected to be a fiery political statement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Various organisations and individuals have appealed to festive revellers to burn copies of the CAA at the Bhogali Bihu bonfires out of bhelaghar, a temporary hay-and-bamboo structure that is turned to ashes as the month of Pausa ends and Magha begins.

Bhogali or Magh Bihu, marking the end of the harvesting season, is to Assam what Pongal is to Tamil Nadu and Lohri to Punjab.

“We cannot ignore our age-old festivals but at the same time, we cannot let a piece of legislation that threatens our Assamese identity and our festivals. We appeal to the people to burn copies of the CAA to register their protest,” All Assam Students’ Union general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said.

Organisations such as the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad and the Cotton University Students’ Union have given similar calls.

Traditionally, pithas (rice cakes) and betel nuts have been thrown into a meji, meaning bonfire,while wishing for a bountiful harvest for the farm season ahead. Copies of CAA would be a “political addition”, community Bihu organisers said.

Anti-CAA sentiments have been all-pervading at Bhogali fairs and stalls that sell festival-related delicacies such as jaggery, curd, til pitha (sticky rice cake with black sesame filling), sunga pitha (rice cake baked inside whole bamboo pieces), ghila pitha (fried rice cakes), narikolor laaru (sweet coconut balls) and kol pitha (banana pancakes).

Most of these stalls, set up a week ahead of the festival on January 14-15, have been displaying placards reading “No CAA”, “Scrap CAA”, and “CAA is anti-Assam”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tuwpte/article30557838.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI12212019000078BTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/in-assam-appeals-to-burn-caa-copies-at-bhogali-bihu-bonfires/article30557764.ece
232,2020/01/13,"Police gets more powers in U.P., commissioner system implemented in Lucknow, Gautam Buddha Nagar","The BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government on January 13 passed a proposal to introduce the police commissioner system in two major cities under which IPS officers would get addtional authority including magisterial powers.

Also read | Ground Zero: Living in fear of the law and the law enforcers

This comes in the wake of violence during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and allegations of police brutality and use of excessive force against protesters.

The proposals were passed by the State Cabinet headed by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The police commissioner system would be implemented in Lucknow and Gautam Buddha Nagar.

Sujeet Pandey, a 1994-batch IPS officer and ADG Prayagraj, was appointed as the new and first ever Police Commissioner of Lucknow. IG Naveen Arora will be Joint Commissioner - Law and Order and Nilabja Chowdhury, also of the same rank, will be Joint Commissioner - Crime and Headquarters in Lucknow.

The system would be slightly different in Gautam Buddha Nagar. While Alok Singh, 1995-batch IPS officer and ADG Meerut Range, will be the Police Commissioner pf Gautam Buddha Nagar, the city would have two Additional Police Commissioners, Triparna Ganguly and Akhilesh Kumar, of the rank of DIG.

“In police commissioner system, police works as a team, under which the police commissioner has some magisterial powers in order to take forward smart and effective policing,” Mr. Adityanath told reporters after the cabinet meeting.

As per an official statement, the government listed several reasons for introducing the police commissioner system including the Hi-Tech nature and complexity of crimes, organized crime menace like drugs and human trafficking and cyber crimes. While the government does not directly link the introduction of the police commissioner system to the recent protests, it evaluates the present system of crowd control as inadequate to prevent damage to public property.

“Law and order challenges have become such that for crowd control and to effectively prevent vandalism of government and private property, the present system is proving to be weak,” the government document said.

This point stands out as the State government recently issued notices to around 500 persons across UP asking them to pay hefty fines for the damage to public and private property in the violence that took place during the protests against the CAA. The notices were issued after Mr. Adityanath vowed to “take revenge” against alleged vandals by confiscating and auctioning their property as compensation for the damages.

Under the new system, Lucknow would have a Police Commissioner (an ADG rank officer), two Joint Commissioners (IG rank) and nine SP rank officers along with a woman SP rank officer especially posted for women security. Apart from the Police Commissioner, Gautam Buddha Nagar would have two Additional Police Commissioners, five SP-rank officers and one woman SP for women security.

Under Section 20 of the CrPC, the Police Commissioner is delegated legal powers of an executive magistrate, while the Joint, Additional and Deputy Commissioners are accorded “special executive” powers of a magistrate under Section 21 of the CrPC.

Mr. Adityanath said the decision marked an “important and historic day” for policing in UP, adding that introducing the Police Commissioner system was the “biggest step towards police reform” in the State.

DGP O.P Singh welcomed the decision as a necessary step towards the taking quick action and said “with this comes greater responsibility to deliver”.

“Earlier policing was in a diversified way. There were many powers and laws where we had to work and depend on each other, due to which the movement was slow,” he said. “If we wanted to take any preventive action for law and order, we had to depend on many factors.”

Mr. Singh said the present generation “seeks a fast response”.

“The way urbanization is increasing and the way in which dimensions of crimes are changing, a lot of things are happening that need quick action. Considering all this, we believe that police commissioner system is suitable and this is being developed as per local conditions,” he said.

BSP chief Mayawati, however, said changing the police system in a few places would not bring about an improvement in the poor law and order in the State. Instead, the government should “rise above party politics” and and take tough legal action against criminal elements, Ms. Mayawati prescribed.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4f3vme/article30440648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31YOGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/police-gets-more-powers-in-up-commissioner-system-implemented-in-lucknow-gautam-buddha-nagar/article30556740.ece
233,2020/01/13,"Maharashtra schools get show-cause notice for taking tutorials on CAA, NRC","The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government of Maharashtra has issued a show-cause notice to private schools for taking tutorials on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

School Education Minister and senior Congress leader Varsha Gaikwad said she issued the notice on Monday, warning the schools to desist from holding lectures/classes/tutorials on the CAA and the NRC that have sparked nationwide protests. Condemning the BJP for taking up such an exercise, she said the government would not allow any politics in schools.

“We have also asked all schools to teach motivational learnings, teach health and hygiene, etc. I request school administration to not play with young minds. Whatever politics you want to play, do it on different platforms,” she said, adding that the BJP should not make any attempt to change history in schools.

The Minister’s action follows demands from her party and Cabinet colleagues to take action against these schools. A Mulund-based school shot into limelight after taking classes on the CAA/NRC.

Cabinet Minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik told The Hindu, “I have demanded that the Minister identify such schools and take the strictest action possible. This politics in schools will not be tolerated.”

Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant tweeted, “Demand strong action against all those @BJP4Maharashtra workers who have tried to pervert the minds of school students & politicise school education. @VarshaEGaikwad (Varsha Gaikwad) ji must take action against this absolutely worst form of politics.”

BJP to file police complaints

The BJP, meanwhile, without denying it was involved in school politics and taking tutorials on CAA/NRC, said it would file police complaints against the Minister's action.

Party’s State vice-president Kirit Somaiya said the party strongly objected to the issuance of notice to schools. “We strongly object to a notice delivered to Mulund’s Dayanand School for the participation of its students in a CAA awareness drive. The twin bills have been passed by Parliament, and if citizens or schools organise any informative drives on the same, why should anybody object. I will file a police complaint against such notice tomorrow.

The inclement weather also forced suspension of helicopter services to and fro the famous shrine of Mata Vaishno Devi in Reasi district, officials said.

The traffic on the highway, which was allowed from Srinagar to Jammu this morning, was halted due to shooting of stones from the hillocks overlooking the arterial road at several places in Ramban district, a traffic department official said.

Heavy rains triggered the shooting of stones in Moumpassi, Digdole and Panthiyal areas this afternoon, forcing suspension of the traffic, the official said, adding snowfall is also continuing on the Kashmir side of the highway since Sunday including Jawahar Tunnel — the gateway to the valley.

“We are monitoring the situation and a decision to allow the traffic will depend on the stopping of shooting stones from the hillocks and the road clearance operation by the concerned agencies,” he said.

Normal life was hit in Jammu due to incessant rains since Monday morning, marring the Lohri and Makar Sankranti celebrations.

People usually lit bonfires and distribute sweets to observe the Lohri festival which marks the end of biting winter chill and the beginning of the harvest season.

Reports of light to moderate snowfall was received from high altitude areas of Jammu region over the past 24 hours, the officials said.

An official of Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board said the helicopter service to and fro the shrine atop Trikuta hills was suspended due to “bad weather”.

However, the pilgrimage is going on smoothly despite heavy rains, he said.

The minimum temperature across Jammu region continued its upward trend for the second day and settled several degrees above the season’s average, an official of the Meteorological department said.

He said Jammu city recorded a low of 11.3 degrees Celsius which is 4.3 notches above normal during this part of the season. The city had recorded a low of 9.3 degrees Celsius the previous night.

Katra town, the base camp for Vaishno Devi shrine, recorded a minimum of 9.4 degrees Celsius, while the Bhaderwah in Doda district was the coldest recorded place in Jammu region with a night temperature of 1.4 degrees Celsius.

235,2020/01/13,Bengal BJP chief courts controversy over remarks against anti-CAA protesters,"The remarks of BJP West Bengal president Dilip Ghosh justifying the killing of some of those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act triggered an outrage on Monday. Leaders of his own party called them “irresponsible”.

“See, our government in Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka has shot them [the protesters] like dogs, put them behind bars and also filed cases against them,” Mr. Ghosh is heard saying in a video. Continuing his argument that “infiltrators” should be treated with raw power, he added, “They will come here, eat, stay, and then destroy property. Do they think this is their zamindari? We will hit them with sticks, shoot them and also sent them to jail.”

Mr. Ghosh made the remark at a party meeting in Nadia district on Sunday evening. The video, which was not verified, surfaced on Monday. In his speech, he also questioned why there was “neither baton-charge, nor firing, nor any FIR filed against protesters in West Bengal”.

“Is it anybody’s paternal property? The rail tracks, roads, buses and trains were made with the money we pay in tax. You are not taking any action only because they are your voters?” he said, before justifying the killings in the States under the BJP.

Union Minister Babul Supriyo, of the BJP, described Mr. Ghosh’s remarks as a “figment” of imagination. “The BJP, as a party, has nothing to do with what Dilip Ghosh may hv [have] said. It is a figment of his imagination & BJP Govts in UP, Assam hv [have] NEVER EVER resorted to shooting people for whatever reason whatsoever. Very irresponsible of Dilip Da to hv [have] said what he said,” he wrote on Twitter.

However, Mr. Ghosh held his ground after asked about Mr. Supriyo’s reaction. He said, “Our government has done that, and if we get a chance we will do the same in Bengal.” Mr. Supriyo retorted that Mr. Ghosh’s remarks were his personal views.

Swapan Dasgupta, a Rajya Sabha member of the BJP, retweeted Mr. Supriyo’s tweet, indicating that he did not support Mr. Ghosh’s comments.

Locket Chatterjee, another party MP and head of the BJP’s Mahila Morcha in West Bengal, said, “The BJP does not want anyone to live in fear. The party wants to provide security to all, and this is the vision of our Prime Minister.”

Trinamool stance

The Trinamool Congress criticised the comments. Its MP Abhishek Banerjee wanted to know whether the remarks were personal, or those of the party. “Although @DilipGhoshBJP correctly characterized his party, his own MP refuting his stance publicly raises serious doubts over his credibility to lead BJP in Bengal. Dilip Babu please let us ALL know if your statements are to be seen as personal opinion or views of your party,” Mr. Banerjee said.

Political observers say the reactions of BJP leaders indicate a power struggle in the party. “Dilip Ghosh is used to making such inflammatory remarks, and this is not the first time he has made remarks aimed at polarising the people. What is interesting is how Bengal BJP MPs have countered them. The larger question is why they did this and whether it indicates a power struggle or strife in Bengal BJP,” Biswanath Chakraborty, political science professor at Rabindra Bharati University, said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/j4rhqt/article29225759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23DILIP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bengal-bjp-chief-courts-controversy-over-remarks-against-anti-caa-protesters/article30554728.ece
236,2020/01/13,Tripura CM orders probe into ‘custodial death’,"Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb on Sunday ordered a magisterial probe into the death of an accused in custody in the west Tripura police station. Sushanta Ghosh (38), a resident of Lankamura locality in Agartala, was arrested on Saturday in connection with an ATM hacking investigation.

The Crime Branch, which is probing the case in which nearly ₹1 crore was siphoned off from over 60 SBI customers’ accounts in November last, picked up Ghosh on the basis of confession of four foreign nationals — two Turks and two Bangladeshis. The CB had recently got the custody of the foreign hackers from the West Bengal police who arrested them in Kolkata based on specific inputs received from their Tripura and Assam counterparts.

The hackers had used a “skimmer device” to snoop on the ATM pin numbers and other technical details of the customers. They then stole the money from the SBI ATM counters at Battala, Indra Nagar and Kaman Chowmuhani as well as a booth of the State co-operative at the Chowmuhani post office in Agartala city.

CCTV footage

The hackers were identified from the CCTV footage in the ATM booths.

An officer of the west Agartala police station, who requested anonymity, said Ghosh was found hanging in the toilet attached to the lock-up before dawn on Sunday. He was taken to a hospital where doctors declared him brought dead, he added.

The father of the deceased alleged that the police had tortured him to death and hanged the body to stage “suicide drama”. Senior police officers visited the police station.

The State Home department in a statement said the Chief Minister had ordered a magisterial inquiry into the death. It said the government had been strict on matters related to law and order.

No bombs were found following a thorough search of the plane after it made an emergency landing and preliminary investigation suggested that it was just a ploy by the woman, who was in an inebriated state, to return to Kolkata, they said.

The incident happened on Saturday night after the Mumbai-bound flight carrying 114 passengers took off at 9.57 p.m. from the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport, they said.

Sends a note

A few minutes after it took off from the airport, the woman passenger on board allegedly gave a note to one of the cabin crew, asking it to be delivered to the pilot. The note said there were bombs strapped to her body and she would detonate it any moment, an airport official said.

Following this, the pilot informed the Air Traffic Controller which directed him to return to the city airport, he said.

“The ATC had declared full emergency at that time. As soon as the aircraft landed, it was taken to the isolation bay at 11.46 p.m.,” he said.

The passenger was taken into custody by the Central Industrial Security Force.

A thorough search of the passenger and the aircraft was carried out but no bombs were found, the official said.

239,2020/01/13,Crocodile population on the rise in Odisha’s Ghodahada reservoir,"Twenty-one mugger crocodiles live in ten village ponds adjoining Ghodahada reservoir of Odisha’s Ganjam district that houses 44 of these reptiles.

This example of peaceful coexistence of humans and crocodiles in the Digapahandi forest range under Berhampur forest division was revealed during annual crocodile census conducted in the region on Saturday. “As per the census, the number of mature crocodiles in Ghodahada reservoir and its adjoining area has increased from 58 in January 2019 to 65 in 2020. In 2019, there were 43 muggers in the reservoir, while 15 were living in the nearby village ponds,” said Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer Amlan Nayak.

The number of mature crocodiles is increasing in the region. In 2018, their number was 45. Digapahandi Forest Range Officer Pramod Kumar Khadagray said that highest number of five crocodiles were in the Ujaleswar temple tank at Khambarigaon village on the banks of the reservoir. The other nine village ponds around the reservoir housed 10 muggers.

As per the locals and forest officials, in the British era, the area zamindar had kept some crocodiles in the Ujaleswar temple tank.

The crocodiles of the Ghodahada reservoir and its adjoining village ponds have never harmed any villagers or domestic animals.

241,2020/01/13,Rural development projects moving at slow pace in Odisha,"The Odisha government’s much-hyped ‘Ama Gaon, Ama Bikash’ (Our village, Our development), in which development projects were directly sanctioned on the basis of interaction between Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik and villagers, has failed to achieve even 50% progress.

To bridge the gap

The State government had launched the programme in order to bridge the gap and the missing link in infrastructure development which were not taken out of any other State or Central government schemes.

Of the 62,743 projects worth ₹1,554 crore sanctioned under the programme, only 29,327 projects have been completed. About 50.32% of the funds earmarked for these projects have been spent.

Stating that the achievement was not satisfactory, the State Panchayati Raj Department has threatened to link the achievement with performance appraisal of field level officers.

“Total 29,327 projects have been completed out of the 62,473 sanctioned projects, which is not satisfactory. The progress of completion of the projects will be reflected in confidential character report of the project director of the district rural development agency and the block development officers,” said Deoranjan Kumar Singh, Panchayati Raj Secretary, in a letter addressed to all the Collectors.

The AGAB, which was widely seen as the BJD government’s attempt to expand its support base before last Assembly elections, is found to have achieved physical progress of around 30% in some districts.

Launched in 2018

In Balasore and Rayagada districts, it was just above 29%. The central Odisha district of Boudh has completed 88% of the AGAB projects.

The government had launched AGAB on March 5, 2018, but its guidelines were approved by the Cabinet after six months.

Video vans used to be pre-positioned in panchayats which were selected by the Panchayati Raj Department. Mr. Patnaik was usually holding interactions with people through videoconferencing at the panchayat level about the development of villages and immediately approving projects.

In October last year, the field level departments were directed to complete all projects by December, but the progress was no way near the target.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rural-development-projects-moving-at-slow-pace-in-odisha/article30552831.ece

243,2020/01/13,Residents demand removal of encroachments on common pathway,"Residents of a colony near Kattumaran Kuttai and members of the Democratic Youth Front of India (DYFI) staged a protest near Erumapalayam on Monday demanding district authorities to remove encroachments on a common pathway and lay a road.

Over 30 families residing near Kattumaran Kuttai have been using a pathway through an agricultural land to access the main road. A few years ago, the land was converted into residential plots and one of the landowners, who bought the property closer to the colony constructed a compound wall obstructing shortest access to the main road. The villagers protested and demanded officials to take necessary action.

However, the issue was taken legally and hearing the plea, the Salem Court ordered that it was a common pathway and advised officials to take necessary action. But, action was not taken to remove the encroachment.

M. Gayathri, one of the residents of the colony said, “we have been using the pathway for decades and the compound wall was constructed only a few years ago claiming that land belongs to them. Without this road, we would have travel around three to four km. through a graveyard to access the main road. This is the only way through which we could easily access in case of medical emergencies. However, despite court order, no action has been taken to remove the encroachments and ensure pathway.”

Murugan, a DYFI functionary, alleged that most families here were from Adidravidar community and the landowner, who belonged to upper caste built the wall discriminating against them. “The landowners wanted to block us from using the road and they even used to abuse us when we pass by in front of the house”, alleged Murugan.

Pon. Ramani, advocate who represented the colony residents, said, “the landowner constructed a compound wall blocking the pathway since it was in the perimeter of the entire residential area. However, hearing the case, the court has ordered right of way and no action has been taken till date to implement the order. However, revenue officials have now told us that necessary action would be taken in two weeks.”

Ponnusamy, the landowner, denied the allegations and said that he owned patta for the land. “We bought the land here around five years ago and we have the patta for this land and the compound wall was constructed only in the perimeters of our property. However, we have decided to move the High Court against lower court’s order,” said Ponnusamy.

Later, police arrived at the spot and pacified the protesters. The protesters said that they would indulge in continuous protests if necessary action is not taken in two weeks.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/wp4nsb/article30560917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA14LAND1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/residents-demand-removal-of-encroachments-on-common-pathway/article30560918.ece

245,2020/01/13,Dumping waste into Perumpallam Canal continues,"Indiscriminate dumping of waste from households, industries and commercial establishments into Perumpallam Canal continues to be a major concern as residents wanted strict action to be taken against the polluters.

The 12.15 km canal from Kadirampatti to Vendipalayam once served as an irrigation canal for 3,035 acre in the city after which the water finally flows into River Cauvery. Over the years, construction of houses on both the sides of the canal, encroachments and dumping of debris into the canal, overgrowth of shrubs led to the canal losing its glory in the past years. While around 750 unauthorised structures have been removed, 2,000 structures are yet to be removed.

Under the Smart City Mission, the corporation began work to develop the canal, including dredging, cement lining the canal, creation of green spaces and landscaping, all at a total cost of ₹ 183.63 crore. Work has begun in the third week of December last year and is expected to be completed in 18 months.

Residents living near the canal said that waste materials are brought in large quantities in autorickshaws and are dumped into the canal even during the day time as there is no monitoring mechanism in place. Since no one questions them, dumping of waste into the canal continues for many years, said Malar, a resident near Stony Bridge. She said that only fences were erected at the sides of the bridge across the canal and not at other places to prevent dumping into the canal.

Corporation officials said despite many warnings, residents and commercial establishments keep dumping waste into the canal and warned them against such practices. Renovation of the canal is carried as six packages and once work is expedited, dumping into the canal will stop permanently, they added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/dumping-waste-into-perumpallam-canal-continues/article30560880.ece

While 26 persons were killed in human-elephant conflicts in 2018-19 (financial year), the toll up to December 31 was 17 in 2019-20.

However, the Nilgiris forest division, which did not have any human deaths due to elephant attacks in 2017-18 and 2018-19 witnessed the death of two persons in 2019-20.

Additional Principal Conservator of Forests Debasis Jana, (Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle) said on Friday that the decline in deaths was registered even when the department was working with 65% of the sanctioned strength of forest staff.

Minimizing response time

According to him, the department was taking multi-disciplinary approach to bring down human casualties caused by elephant attacks. “We are working towards minimizing the response time taken by department staff to reach human-elephant conflict zone when conflict situation comes up. This cannot be achieved with the effort of the staff alone. Human-elephant conflict resolution committees will be formed involving local people to further improve mitigation measures,” said Mr. Jana in an interactive session held for forest officers and representatives of various non-Governmental organisations in Coimbatore.

He said that the department was also taking efforts to make fodder and water available inside the forest to reduce incidents of wild elephants entering human habitations.

According to Mr. Jana, the department was awaiting allocation of funds to set up a real-time elephant monitoring system that uses thermal camera to track animal movement.

Thermal cameras

“We have sent a proposal for the real-time elephant monitoring and alert system which requires about ₹7.2 crore. The thermal cameras of the system can detect elephant movement from a distance of three to four km. The proposal has been approved by the Government.

The area is located on the city outskirts where many residential colonies, including Ram Nagar, EB Nagar, Sri Nagar, Karumbarai and Amman Nagar with over 1,200 houses are located. The road serves as a link road to connect with Solar and Vellalapalayam.

Absence of adequate bins forced the residents to dump waste on the road, presenting a pathetic sight, said Palanisamy, a resident. He said door-to-door garbage collection was ineffective and the residents packed the garbage in plastic covers and drop them on the road.

The residents pointed out that only a few bins were present in the area that had over 50 houses on each street. “The garbage collected from houses are dumped on the road and is cleared once in a month,” said Kavitha, another resident.

256,2020/01/13,Bio-fence to be developed to keep wild elephants at bay in Coimbatore,"The Forest Department in Coimbatore is working on a model of biological elephant barricade, which is made of thorny plant varieties. Compared to other strategies used in preventing elephant movement into human habitations, bio-fencing is cost-effective, according to the Forest Department.

Additional Principal Conservator of Forests Debasis Jana, (Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle) told here on Friday that the Coimbatore Forest Division was working on the bio-fencing model, which primarily makes use of cactus variety Cylindropuntia ramosissima, locally known as Suramul.

Animals are scared of approaching the plant because of its long spines. A thorny variety from the Euphorbia family is also used for the bio-fencing. “This is a cost-effective model compared to elephant-proof trench and electric fencing (DC current), the two models widely used. We are hoping to standardise the model by the end of this year so that it can be introduced on a large scale,” he said.

Coimbatore District Forest Officer D. Venkatesh said Suramul was grown along forest boundary near Anuvavi Subramaniaswamy Temple, and was found effective to keep wild elephants away. At Karamadai, some farmers were using a Euphorbia variety, as a fence to protect crops from animals.

According to Mr. Jana, around ₹ 5.5 lakh was required to make one km of elephant-proof trench. However, the trench was not viable on a rocky terrain. The trench also requires maintenance as soil and rocks accumulate at the bottom over a period.

“If we create trenches around a specific forest area and leave a small gap due to difficulty in digging the terrain, the trench does not serve its purpose. However, the bio-fencing can be introduced in such terrains as well. Other than against elephants, bio-fencing has also been found effective in keeping away other animals like wild boar that damage crops. Once the model gets standardised, the Department will create awareness among farmers to use it” he said.

Mr. Jana said that a fence with beehives was also an effective measure to prevent elephant movement as the animal was said to be scared of honeybees. However, beehive fencing was possible only along boundaries of forests where honey-loving bear population was nil.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/8hra2d/article30552535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB13SURAMUL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bio-fence-to-be-developed-to-keep-wild-elephants-at-bay/article30552536.ece

259,2020/01/13,Excess fare collection by TNSTC continues in Coimbatore,"Buses operated by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), particularly semi-low floor (SLF) buses, continue to be accused of charging excess fares despite multiple representations made to the authorities in the past.

Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon, a member of the District Road Safety Committee who has been raising this issue frequently for nearly a decade, alleged that many TNSTC buses arbitrarily fix ‘stages’ or stops without prior permission to increase the initial fare fixed. “Stages such as LIC (on Avinashi Road) or GH (Coimbatore Medical College Hospital on Trichy Road) are not approved,” he said.

Mr. Kathirmathiyon also alleged that there is no proper definition of deluxe buses as labelled in many SLF city buses, which charge more than the regular buses.

A letter from Transport Commissioner K. Samayamoorthy dated December 13, 2018 asked the District Collectors or Regional Transport Authorities (RTAs) to cancel the permits of buses charging excess fares and in turn, violating the Motor Vehicles Rules. “According to Rule 205 of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, the Transport Authority may suspend or cancel a permit in respect of all or any of the vehicles specified in the permit,” the letter noted. A similar letter was also addressed to the Regional Transport Officers (RTOs) across the State instructing them to take strict action against buses violating the rules.

However, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said that no strict action has been taken by either the district administration or the RTOs. Such buses that charge excess fares must be levied a heavy penalty by the transport officials, failure to pay which the buses should be impounded, he suggested.

Manoj Arun, a member of Makkal Pathai, a non-governmental organisation, claimed that one of the reasons behind the excess fares is that information such as route maps, fare charts, permit details and vehicle registration details were not available either inside the buses or at the TNSTC website, leading to a lack of transparency. Despite the introduction of new air suspension buses in 2019, many SLF buses procured under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) scheme nearly a decade ago continue to charge excess fare, he said. “Despite the facilities differing in these two types of buses, they charge the same fare,” Mr. Arun alleged.

K. Nagarajan, committee member of Retired TNSTC Employees Welfare Association, said that complaints of excess fare, particularly in SLF buses, have been persisting for more than five years. “This has led to the decrease in patronage of TNSTC buses in Coimbatore,” he said. The buses in October last year is considered as SLF buses, Mr. Nagarajan noted.

When contacted, a TNSTC official denied the accusations of any excess fares, noting that the four types of fares charged earlier have been brought down to two types of fares at present: for SLF and regular buses. “The minimum fare in regular buses is ₹5 while in SLF buses it is ₹11,” the official said. Such regular buses will have a sticker on the front that reads “Regular Fare: Minimum ₹5,” the official said.

A total of 50 red-coloured buses were introduced last year to replace the SLF buses, which also charge a minimum fare of ₹11. Regarding the reason for the fare, the official cited the features that the new buses have such as air suspension and spacious interiors.

The TNSTC official added that the RTOs will levy a fine for buses collecting excess fares as per the fine amount fixed by the RTA. The RTOs are also cracking down on TNSTC buses plying without route maps and fare charts placed inside, according to the official.

An official from one of the Regional Transport Offices in the city said that a check report will be issued to buses found violating the Motor Vehicles Rules. The violations are classified into major and minor offences, wherein charging excess fare is classified as a minor offence that attracts a fine amount of up to ₹3,000, the official said. The RTOs will not renew the fitness certificates of buses if fare charts and route maps were found to be absent in buses, the transport official noted.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/2q9iu1/article30552481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB13-BUSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/excess-fare-collection-by-tnstc-continues/article30552482.ece
260,2020/01/13,Bike taxi drivers in Coimbatore allege threats from autorickshaw drivers,"With the bike taxis gaining popularity despite lack of adequate regulations, its drivers allege threats from autorickshaw drivers in parts of city.

A bike taxi driver working for Rapido told The Hindu that bike taxi drivers do not park their vehicles in front of autorickshaws at Coimbatore Railway Station. “Once autorickshaw drivers see us receiving cash from customers, they recognise us,” he said when asked how they were being identified as bike taxi drivers without them wearing any uniforms. The autorickshaw drivers then allegedly threaten them not to drive bike taxis.

Another Rapido driver said that he had heard from his fellow drivers about incidents of autorickshaw drivers allegedly threatening, but added that he has not faced any such incidents himself.

The introduction of bike taxis has remained contentious since August 1, 2019, when a Division Bench of the Madras High Court allowed bike taxis in the State by staying the operation of a previous order passed by the court that restrained Roppen Transportation Services from operating Rapido. Various associations and unions representing autorickshaw drivers have since petitioned the district administration and transport department officials, claiming that bike taxis would be detrimental to the livelihood of autorickshaw drivers.

A transport official said that the State government has not formed regulations pertaining to bike taxis despite five months after the Madras High Court verdict. “The government is preparing the regulations. It has not been finalised yet,” the official noted.

J.M. Ismail, district vice-president of an autorickshaw drivers union affiliated with the AIADMK, denied these allegations, adding that some of the autorickshaw drivers have “questioned” bike taxi drivers in some places. “They ask questions like ‘Why are you picking up customers?’ and ‘Which RTO gave you the permission?’,” Mr. Ismail said. He alleged that the claims made by the bike taxi drivers were exaggerated and intended to show autorickshaw drivers in a poor light.

A Rapido official said that the drivers have complained of such incidents, particularly near Gandhipuram Central Bus Terminus and Coimbatore Railway Station, where autorickshaws are present in large numbers. However, the official noted that such incidents are sporadic. “In such cases, we have asked our drivers to contact the nearest police station,” the official said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/n36128/article30554555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bike-taxiJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bike-taxi-drivers-in-coimbatore-allege-threats-from-autorickshaw-drivers/article30552457.ece
261,2020/01/13,Kohli — looking at the larger picture,"India captain Virat Kohli was at his eloquent best on Monday. Excerpts:

On batting lower down, if K.L. Rahul, Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan play

Yeah, big possibility, very happy to. I'm not possessive about where I play. Being the captain, it’s my job to make sure that the next lot is also ready. The vision has to be about the larger picture. If at all someone has to take responsibility, it should be me.

Playing Australia

They are a stronger side than the one that came to India last time. But they still won that series. The series before that, they were at full strength but we won. You may have the best players, but if you don’t play well as a team, you won’t win. Shows you how competitive the series between these teams are... the margin is always 3-2 or 2-1.

They have played so much IPL they are pretty experienced in these conditions. It’s always a challenge playing Australia, because of the skill-set and mind-set they bring onto the field.

Playing at the Wankhede

It's probably the best pitch to bat on in India. Not to take anything away from what bowlers can do here. When on a roll, they can pick up quick wickets.

In one-dayers you can get pace and bounce and sometimes seam as well under lights. It's probably, along with Adelaide, the best batting wicket I've played on.

On Tim Paine's pink-ball Test suggestion

We played the day-night Test here, we were pretty happy how it went. It's become a very exciting feature of any Test series and we’re open to playing day-night Tests. We’re up for the challenge — whether it's the Gabba, Perth... it doesn't matter. We have the skill-set as a team to compete against anyone in the world, anywhere, in any format of the game. Whether it's white-ball, red-ball or pink-ball, we're ready!",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sceqr7/article30561394.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14VIRAT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kohli-looking-at-the-larger-picture/article30561396.ece
262,2020/01/13,Ranji Trophy: Tamil Nadu in a precarious situation,"Five wickets in the second session within a span of 14 overs helped Mumbai move into a commanding position against Tamil Nadu on the third day of their Ranji Trophy clash at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium here with the hosts tottering at 249 for seven.

Chasing 488, TN was motoring along steadily at 178 for two when pacer Tushar Deshpande removed skipper B. Aparajith leg-before. In the very next over, Shams Mulani struck twice to remove the well-set Kaushik Gandhi (60) and Pradosh Ranjan Paul to reduce TN to 178 for five.

Brilliant catch

Later, left-arm pacer Royston Dias removed B. Indrajith — brilliantly caught by Jay Bista standing close to the batsman at second slip — and Dinesh Karthik caught behind. The home team had lost five wickets for the addition of just 17 runs.

Earlier, resuming at 66 for no loss, TN lost opener Abhinav Mukund early when Deshpande from around the wicket made the batsman play away from the body and edge to first slip.

Deshpande also got the ball to come into the right-handers at a sharp pace and could have had Kaushik caught behind had he not overstepped when the batsman was on one.

While the Mumbai spinners showed great discipline in keeping things tight, skipper Tare too led the side well with attacking fields and having men close to the bat even when the pacers were on to put pressure on the batsmen.

Post lunch, Kaushik and Aparajith looked to be aggressive against the spinners with Kaushik hitting a six and a four off Mulani to reach his half-century.

But just after Aparajith was leg-before to Deshpande, Kaushik threw away his wicket. He stepped out to a wide delivery from Mulani only for the ball to spin away sharply and wicketkeeper Tare whipped the bails quickly.

Rearguard effort

A gritty rearguard effort from R. Ashwin and R. Sai Kishore ensured TN lost no further wickets in the last session as both the batsmen showed great application in batting time, scoring 41 runs off 27 overs.

The two would need to repeat the same on the final day to bail out TN from a self-inflicted precarious position it finds itself in.

The scores:

Mumbai — 1st innings: 488.

Tamil Nadu — 1st innings: Abhinav Mukund c Bista b Deshpande 58, L. Suryapprakash c Deshpande b Bhoir 41, Kaushik Gandhi st. Tare b Mulani 60, B. Aparajith lbw b Deshpande 14, B.

263,2020/01/13,Sri Lanka to leave for Zimbabwe for two match Test series,"Sri Lanka’s cricket team will leave for Zimbabwe on Thursday to play a two-match Test series — the first since the African host nation’s suspension was lifted by the ICC.

Both Tests will be held in Harare, the first from Sunday and the second starting on January 27th, Sri Lanka Cricket said on Monday.

However, SLC is yet to announce the squad for the two matches.

Zimbabwe last played a Test in November 2018 when it toured Bangladesh.

The country was barred from ICC events in July last year because of political interference but was readmitted by the International Cricket Council three months later.

Political turmoil within the sport and a string of humiliating performances led Zimbabwe to suspend its Test involvement in 2005, although it continued to play One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.

264,2020/01/13,ICC plans to expand T20 WC,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) is considering expanding the T20 World Cup from 16 to 20 teams from the 2023-31 cycle, according to a media report here.

The ICC, which views the T20 format as the best way to increase the reach of the sport, is mulling the option as a way for cricket to try and match the popularity of sports like football and basketball, according to the Telegraph.co.uk

The newspaper reported that this consideration is “a part of broader discussions for the shape of international cricket calendar from 2023-2031”. The first T20 World Cup in this cycle is scheduled for 2024.

The ICC had earlier put forward a proposal to organise a flagship event every year as a plan to enter the global media rights markets and the a bigger T20 World Cup will also increase the viewership.

A bigger tournament will also increase the likelihood of the participation of the USA, a market where ICC has recently made several attempts to spread the sport. Other teams that could take part are Canada, Germany, Nepal and Nigeria.

Two options

The ICC is looking at two options for the format if the tournament expands to 20 teams. One of the options is the current two-tier format used in the T20 World Cup with lower-ranked teams playing the qualifiers to reach the main draw which includes the top countries.

Second possibility

The second possibility could be four groups of five teams each with the top sides from each group progressing to the knockout stage.

265,2020/01/13,West Indies vs Ireland| Lewis ton leads to series sweep,"Evin Lewis smashed a dazzling century as West Indies defeated Ireland by five wickets on Sunday to complete a 3-0 sweep of the One-Day International series.

Opener Lewis hit his third one-day ton off 96 balls with six boundaries and five huge sixes at the National Stadium here as West Indies reached its rain-revised target of 197 with 64 balls to spare.

The 28-year-old, left-handed Lewis had made an unbeaten 99 in the first game in Barbados which his team won also by five wickets. “All the hard work I’ve done in the nets has paid off,” Trinidadian Lewis said at the trophy presentation.

“This was an opportunity for my first hundred in the Caribbean, and it’s great to get a series win. I’ve been hungry for runs.”

Lewis had reached his 50 off 41 balls while laying the foundation for a comfortable win thanks to a 100-run partnership with Brandon King (38 off 43 balls) for the third wicket.

He reached his century with a mid-wicket flourish off medium-pacer Craig Young before falling next ball trying for a big drive, caught by Kevin O’Brien.

Rain stoppage

By then the West Indies was only five short of its target which had been revised after a brief rain stoppage.

Young suffered the worst punishment with his nine overs yielding just one wicket for 57 runs.

Nicholas Pooran confirmed his stature in the West Indies middle-order with an unbeaten 43 off 44 balls. Earlier, leg-spinner Hayden Walsh took four wickets as Ireland was dismissed for 203.

Walsh, who starred with the bat with an undefeated 46 in Thursday’s nail-biting one-wicket win in Barbados, finished with figures of four for 36. Recalled fast bowler Oshane Thomas claimed three for 41. Walsh took the prime wicket of Ireland skipper Andy Balbirnie whose impressive innings of 71 ended when he pushed the ball to point and was caught.

For Balbirnie, it was his ninth ODI half-century while his innings featured six boundaries and two sixes. Andy McBrine was Ireland’s second highest scorer with an unbeaten 25.

“We’ve managed to get in but not kick off, we were outclassed today but we can take improvements from the three games,” insisted Balbirnie, whose side were playing a series for the first time in six months.

“We don’t have the quickest bowlers in the world or the biggest turners, but we can be disciplined. The second game was a big positive, we just didn’t have that composure.” The two sides now play a three-game T20 series from Wednesday.

The scores: Ireland 203 in 49.1 overs (A. Balbirnie 71; H. Walsh 4/36, O. Thomas 3/41) lost to West Indies 199/5 in 36.2 overs (E. Lewis 102, N. Pooran 43) (West Indies won by five wickets with 64 balls to spare via D/L method).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/akhoml/article30560754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14EVIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/west-indies-vs-ireland-lewis-ton-leads-series-sweep/article30560755.ece
266,2020/01/13,Bangladesh says no to Test series in Pakistan,"Bangladesh decided to stay firm in its decision to just play three Twenty20 internationals in Pakistan later this month, dismissing a Pakistani proposal to take part in a full Test series.

Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan on Sunday said the recent tension in the Middle East between Iran and the United States was the main reason behind the decision as the government had given the board permission to send the team only for a short period.

“The current state in the Middle East is definitely different than other times. So considering escalating tension in that particular region, they (the government) have told us to keep the tour as short as possible,” Hassan told reporters here after a meeting of the BCB board.

“They (government authorities) have told us to play the three Twenty20s as quickly as possible in a short period. Later, if the situation improves, we can play the Test matches. We are going to communicate the same thing to Pakistan Cricket Board,” he said.

According to the ICC’s Future Tour Programme, Bangladesh is scheduled to play three T20Is and two Tests in Pakistan in January-February.

The BCB had earlier made a similar proposal to play T20s in Pakistan, but the PCB had rejected its offer. The PCB wants Bangladesh to play Test matches if Bangladesh is to make the series short as two Tests are also part of the ICC Test Championship.The BCB president said he will be flying to Dubai on Monday to discuss with ICC chairman Shashank Manohar about the possible implications of skipping the Test series against Pakistan

267,2020/01/13,Andhra has Hyderabad on the mat,"Hyderabad faces an uphill task of saving the match after being reduced to 45 for three against Andhra at close of play on the third day of their four-day Ranji Trophy Elite Group encounter at the CSR Sarma College Ground here on Monday.

Earlier, Andhra, resuming at 237 for one in reply to Hyderabad first innings score of 225, declared its innings at 489 for eight after batting for 59 overs on Monday and taking a massive first innings lead of 264 runs.

Big stand

This was largely possible thanks to a 161-run stand for the fifth wicket between Ricky Bhui (69, 132b) and Karan Shinde (94,140b).

This was a crucial stand as it came after left-arm pacer Chama Milind raised hopes of Hyderabad coming back strongly this morning with two quick wickets.

He dismissed the well-set Andhra captain Hanuma Vihari (55, 113b) and cleaned up wicketkeeper-batsman Srikar Bharat (5).

But, to the dismay of Hyderabad camp, Bhui and Shinde showed the right application during their partnership with sensible stroke selection.

Shinde was unlucky to miss a century when he was bowled by left-arm spinner Mehdi Hassan.

Then, K.V. Sasikanth chipped in with a useful contribution to increase the lead for Andhra.

And, when Hyderabad batted for the second time, it was a familiar story of losing early wickets with pacer P. Vijay Kumar picking all three wickets to fall in the final session.

The first to go was opener Akshath Reddy (4) in the third over. Vijay then removed J. Mallikarjun (2) and Himalay Agarwal (0) to see Hyderabad in dire straits at 22 for three in seven overs.

Captain Tanmay Agarwal and Jaweed Ali were at the crease when stumps were drawn for the day.

268,2020/01/13,An important win: Baby,"Kerala captain Sachin Baby was obviously a relieved man after his team secured its first win in this Ranji Trophy season.

“We needed this win badly. We had lost a couple of close games which I thought we should have won. It was important for us to win in our home conditions. I had faith in our spinners and though the target wasn’t big I backed my boys to bowl them out. Jalaj bowled superbly in the second innings. Salman Nizar played a mature innings in the first innings and Nidheesh bowled his heart out. It was a team effort. We have the momentum now and obviously we are confident of doing well in the other matches,” he said.

It was another day in office for Kerala’s second innings bowling hero Jalaj Saxena. “The wicket was helpful but it wasn’t that difficult to bat on. I varied my pace and mixed the deliveries to confuse the batsmen and it paid off. I am quite used to bowling long spells so I was ready to shoulder the burden,” said Jalaj who took his 20th fifth wicket haul in Ranji Trophy.

269,2020/01/13,Jalaj spins Kerala to victory,"Kerala finally put its faltering Ranji Trophy campaign back on track with a 21-run win came in a humdinger against Punjab at the KCA-St. Xavier’s College ground here on Monday.

Chasing a modest 146, Punjab was bundled out for 124 as Jalaj Saxena — he bowled unchanged — made optimum use of a deteriorating surface to bag seven wickets for 51 runs off 23.1 overs and enabled Kerala secure its first win of the season.

The uneven bounce and turn kept the batsmen guessing and Punjab quickly slid to 89 for eight. But an enterprising 33-run ninth-wicket stand between Siddharth Kaul (22) and Mayank Markande (23) frustrated the host. Luckily for Kerala the tea break came at the right time and when play resumed, M.D. Nidheesh struck off the third ball. Kaul, who followed his five wicket haul with an aggressive knock, poked at an out-swinger and was caught by wicket-keeper Azharuddeen. Then Jalaj wrapped up the innings when Markande got a faint edge to a spinning delivery which was snapped up by Sachin Baby at backward short-leg.

Wrong note

Punjab started its chase on the wrong note when it lost Rohan Marwaha off the second ball of the innings. Marwaha’s attempted sweep off Jalaj ended in the hands of Azharuddeen. Sanbir Singh opened with a flurry of boundaries but Sijomon Joseph yorked him in his first over. Skipper Mandeep Singh (10) then swept Jalaj straight to Nidheesh at midwicket to trigger another collapse.

Jalaj dismissed Anmolpreet Singh for a golden duck and in the next over Abhishek Sharma (0) played an ugly hoick against Sijomon and was stumped. Punjab slipped from 38 for two to 40 for five in the space of an over.

Gurkeerat Maan, who curbed his aggressive game, then added 28 for the sixth wicket with Anumol Malhortra before Jalaj trapped both in front with deliveries that kept low. Then came the ninth wicket stand that nearly brought victory for Punjab.

270,2020/01/13,"Pataudi Memorial Lecture: Sehwag cautions cricketers on corruption, doping in cricket","Former India opener Virender Sehwag has expressed his concern over the menace of corruption and doping in cricket, calling on both the players and administrators to shoulder responsibility of keeping the game clean in every aspect.

Delivering the ‘MAK Pataudi Memorial Lecture’ at the annual BCCI awards here on Sunday, Sehwag said the players should never ignore a corrupt approach.

“If you love this game, then you should not go on that path. If you go to that path, it means you don’t love this game, that means you are only playing for money,” Sehwag said.

“If you play well, money will follow. So don’t go (that path). If somebody contacts you, please tell BCCI and the ICC, that is important. If you ignore, he will go to somebody else and that somebody else might do stupid things. Make sure you inform,” he added.

Last year top Bangladesh player Shakib Al Hasan was banned for two years, one year suspended, after failing to report a corrupt approach by a suspected Indian bookie, sending down shock waves in the cricket community.

Dope testing

Speaking about doping, Sehwag stressed on the need for greater awareness after a top-performing young player like Prithvi Shaw served an eight-month ban for failing a dope test.

“I can understand a lot of cricketers are doing fitness (regimens), having lot of shakes but I don’t think that you can have anything and build your muscles, which can help you to perform in batting or bowling,” he said.

“So please keep yourself available for anti-doping (tests). We have seen a couple of young cricketers banned by BCCI for having banned substances. It’s the BCCI’s responsibility also to ensure that awareness starts from the under-16 and under-19 levels,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/3r3yct/article30558510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SEHWAGK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pataudi-memorial-lecture-sehwag-cautions-cricketers-on-corruption-doping-in-cricket/article30558511.ece
271,2020/01/13,"India ready to play day-night Test in Australia, says Kohli","India captain Virat Kohli on Monday asserted that India are ready to play a day/night Test in Australia later this year, giving, in his trademark manner, a counter to Tim Paine’s cheeky dig at him.

Kohli was asked about it on the eve of the three-match ODI series opener against Australia.

“We’re ready and up for the challenge - whether it’s Gabba, Perth... it doesn’t matter to us. It’s become a very exciting feature of any Test series and we’re open to playing day-night Tests,” Kohli said.

India played their maiden day-night Test against Bangladesh last November at the Eden Gardens, winning the match quite comfortably with plenty of time to spare.

“We played the day-night Test here, we were pretty happy with how it went. We have the skill-sets as a team now to compete against anyone in the world, anywhere, in any format of the game, whether it’s white ball, red ball or pink ball, we’re ready to play anything,” Kohli asserted.

Last year, when asked about it, Paine had sarcastically remarked that his Australian team would need to ask Kohli if he was willing to play a day-night Test Down Under.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5kbyah/article30477967.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRATK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-ready-to-play-day-night-test-in-australia-says-kohli/article30556827.ece
272,2020/01/13,1st ODI preview: It’s time to sit up when the world’s best face off,"At a time when bilateral cricket is jostling for relevance, sandwiched between the countdown to the T20 World Cup and the World Test Championship is a three-match ODI series between India and Australia, which starts at the Wankhede Stadium on Tuesday.

But, how relevant is relevance in the larger context, when the world’s best two teams square off!

At full strength

Also, the fact that both teams are at full-strength is great news for aficionados and connoisseurs alike.

India captain Virat Kohli has no doubt there will be no dearth of intense action.

“When you are playing Australia, you don’t look at the relevance of the series. It’s about playing against the best. The way they are playing now, after Steve and David have come back, it’s pretty intense,” Kohli said.

“They are challenging every team and they are dominating a few teams as well. I think India and Australia are probably the top two sides in the world, as far as balance is concerned. Whether it’s relevant or irrelevant that’s for people to decide. But we as a team are excited to play Australia, in our conditions, to test ourselves against the best.”

India has a tough choice to make when it comes to batting order, with all three specialist openers in sublime touch.

While batting coach Vikram Rathour had said on Sunday either Shikhar Dhawan or K.L. Rahul would start the series along with Rohit Sharma, Kohli contradicted this stating the three could well feature in the starting line-up. In such a scenario, Kohli may move down to No. 4 from his customary No. 3.

Kohli was at his best during Monday’s training, prevailing over Jasprit Bumrah in a mini-battle during optional practice and also celebrating it in style.

Australia, on the other hand, will be keen on unleashing its lethal pace trio of Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood on India’s famed batting order.

Set to play an ODI together for the first time since October 2018, the troika will be looking forward to starting Australia’s maiden ODI assignment since the World Cup with a bang at the Wankhede.

At the same time, Australia will be banking on Marnus Labuschagne to carry his Test exploits into the ODI arena. If Labuschagne marks his debut by complementing veterans Steve Smith and David Warner on Tuesday, Aaron Finch’s men can hope for an encore of its series victory last year.

Despite not travelling with its best combination, Finch and Co. made a stunning comeback after trailing 2-0 to take home the series 3-2 in India last March. India will know that to avenge that series defeat, it will have to play out of its skins over the next week.

If the series-opener ends up a high-quality affair, the series will not at all struggle for relevance.

Squads:

India: Virat Kohli (Captain), Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, K L Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Rishabh Pant (Wicket-keeper), Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Navdeep Saini, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur and Mohammed Shami.

Australia: Aaron Finch (Captain), Alex Carey (Wicket-keeper), Patrick Cummins, Ashton Agar, Peter Handscomb, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschange, Kane Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Ashton Turner, David Warner and Adam Zampa.

273,2020/01/13,"MVA cautious over picking staff, avoids those with BJP ministers","The delay in appointments of staff in the offices of ministers in the Maha Vikas Aghadi government is mainly due to the extensive background search before sanctioning the names. Another reason contributing to the delay is the instructions from top party bosses to avoid the officials who had worked with the earlier government in important positions, especially with the ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Out of the 33 Cabinet Ministers, including Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, none of them have set up full-fledged office. The final appointments of staff, including personal secretary and officers on special duty (OSD), are still pending for all the ministers.

As per rules, each minister, except for the Chief Minister and the Deputy Chief Minister, is sanctioned to have a staff of one personal secretary, three personal assistants (which can be converted to OSDs), two stenos, two clerks, one driver, and a peon.

At a meeting of party ministers at Y.B. Chavan Centre, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar sounded a word of caution to his colleagues while choosing the staff. “He told us to ensure a full background check. Though he didn’t particularly tell us to avoid the officials who had worked with the BJP ministers, the issue was discussed. No one will tell us to not take a particular officer in our staff, but the discussion of the issue is an indication for us to decide how to go forward,” a NCP minister said.

During the meetings to finalise the common minimum programme (CMP) of the three parties, the issue of appointments of minister’s staff was discussed in detail. “We had decided to avoid, if possible, to take those who had worked with the BJP ministers,” the NCP minister said.

According to sources, a Congress minister and two Shiv Sena ministers have already appointed an officer each from the BJP ministers’ team and the NCP has raised the objection of not adhering to the CMP.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/vmykh/article30553353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMAJITUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/mva-cautious-over-picking-staff-avoids-those-with-bjp-ministers/article30553352.ece
274,2020/01/13,Common minimum programme’s aim was to keep BJP out of power: Fadnavis,"Alleging that the common minimum programme (CMP) of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is ‘anti-farmer’, former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said the objective of CMP was to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) out of power at any cost.

Speaking in Solapur on Sunday, Mr. Fadnavis dared his detractors, including former CM Prithviraj Chavan and farmers’ leader and Swabhimani Paksha president Raju Shetti to prove whether any scams had been committed during the tenure of his BJP-led government.

“It has been two months since this [MVA] government has been formed, yet there has been no meeting to take stock of the problems the sugar cooperative sector is facing. The three parties [the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress] claim their CMP is based on the welfare of farmers and farm labourers…well, their only ‘CMP’ so to speak was to keep the BJP out of power. The three parties only want power for their sake and they do not have the interests of Maharashtra in their minds,” the BJP leader said.

Mr. Fadnavis claimed that his government had always ensured that sugar cane farmers had been paid their fair and remunerative price (FRP) on time. “When we came to power in 2014, the Opposition had mocked us by saying that we [the BJP] did not understand the technicalities of the cooperative sector… But our government never defaulted on the FRP in the five years that we were in power and when we faced certain obstacles, we made provisions for a package of ₹2,000 crore to be given to farmers.”

Hitting out at his estranged ally, the Sena, the BJP leader attacked Mr. Thackeray’s farm loan waiver plan, saying it would not benefit a single afflicted farmer in the State.

“Around 94 lakh hectares of crop land have been destroyed by unseasonal rain in October. But this government has announced that it will waive loans between 2015 and September 2019. The implication of this absurd proclamation means no farmer who has suffered due to unseasonal rain in October can avail of any benefit in the government’s ₹25,000 per hectare compensation,” Mr. Fadnavis said, alleging the government is only hoodwinking farmers and betraying their trust. “Instead, for the past five years, it was our BJP government which stood firm behind the farmer in their hour of crisis by waiving loans to the tune of ₹50,000 crore,” he said.

Mr. Fadnavis challenged leaders from the three ruling parties to launch any inquiry into the workings of the erstwhile BJP government if they so wished.

In a thinly-veiled jibe at Mr. Chavan, he said the BJP did not worry or take cognisance of such ‘threats’. “The BJP government had discharged its functions in a most transparent manner. So, if you [Congress and other ruling parties] do not have proof of any misdemeanour, do not hurl shallow threats at us. The public has seen our work,” Mr. Fadnavis said, further claiming that the BJP had never halted any projects or withheld funds to Opposition legislators when it was in power.

Earlier, Mr. Chavan had dubbed the BJP government under Mr. Fadnavis as corrupt while stating that the new MVA dispensation would conduct inquiries into the workings of the past government as it had proofs of alleged wrongdoings.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/91jdjn/article30553310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMFadnavis-Solapur,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/common-minimum-programmes-aim-was-to-keep-bjp-out-of-power-fadnavis/article30553311.ece
275,2020/01/13,Border row: Karnataka Police prevent Marathi writers from attending meet,"The recent spike in Maharashtra-Karnataka border tensions over the long-standing Belagavi claim dispute cast its shadow on the literary world, with the Karnataka Police on Sunday allegedly refusing entry to a group of Marathi littérateurs for attending a rural literary meet in Belagavi’s Khanapur tehsil.

The group led by writer Shripal Sabnis was going for a ‘Marathi Sahitya Sammelan’ scheduled at Idanhol when they were prevented by the police, and warned they would be taken into custody if they attempted to proceed to the venue. The organisers, too, were discouraged from holding the Khanapur meet which eventually did not take place as a result of the police’s directives.

The Karnataka police’s high-handedness elicited sharp criticism from Shiv Sena leader Subhash Desai, who is the Cabinet Minister for Marathi language and Cultural Affairs. “Today, a group of litterateurs were prohibited entry by the Karnataka police and were detained in Belagavi. I strongly condemn this repression on part of the police authorities,” Mr. Desai tweeted.

Mr. Sabnis hit out at the B.S. Yeddiyurappa government by likening it to a ‘neo- Hitler regime’. “A number of literary meets have been held in the past in the border areas…I was proceeding to one such meet today. But it seems that a Hitler has risen within the Karnataka government, which informed the police to prevent us from holding a literary meet…the organisers were directed not to hold the event while we were threatened with arrest if we attempted to reach the spot. The government had no moral nor ethical right to stop us,” Mr. Sabnis said at a press conference in Belagavi.

Demanding that the Centre reprimand the Karnataka government for its repressive actions, he said it was shameful that the discriminatory tactics of the Yeddiyurappa government was heightening linguistic tensions. “The Karnataka government’s actions constitute a blight on the teachings of harmony and unity of its saints and philosophers like Basaveshwara [12th century] and Kanaka Dasa [16th century Vaishnava poet].”

“The claim over Belagavi and the question of the 20 lakh Marathi-speaking populace on the Maharashtra-Karnataka border region remains unsolved. Such incidents only serve to further exacerbate tensions. The Karnataka government’s actions tantamount to a murder of constitutional principles,” Mr. Sabnis said, lauding the steps taken by the Uddhav Thackeray government in expediting a resolution of the decades-old border dispute.

Last month, the Maharashtra-Karnataka border dispute over the status of Belagavi district witnessed a reigniting of tensions. The immediate trigger was a controversial statement by Karnataka Navnirman Sena (KNS) chief Bhimashankar Patil, who allegedly said that the Marathi-speaking leaders of the Belagavi-based Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) “ought to be shot dead”.

Mr. Patil’s remark has stirred up a hornet’s nest with the KNS and the Shiv Sena — both regional and chauvinistic parties — attempting to outdo each other in rhetoric and deed. Protests by the KNS in Belagavi and counter protests by the Sena in Kolhapur and Sangli districts prompted the police to stop State Transport bus services from Kolhapur to Belagavi. Both parties also defaced billboards and hoardings in Marathi and Kannada on their respective sides of the border.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/border-row-karnataka-police-prevent-marathi-writers-from-attending-meet/article30553281.ece

278,2020/01/13,JNU professors’ plea seeks preservation of data on Jan. 5 violence,"The Delhi High Court on Monday issued notice to the Delhi Police, Google, WhatsApp and Apple on a petition filed by three Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) professors seeking preservation of data pertaining to the January 5 violence on the campus.

Justice Brijesh Sethi posted the case for detailed hearing on Tuesday as counsel for social media sites were not present when the case came up for hearing in the morning.

During the brief hearing, the police said they were taking all necessary steps to preserve the CCTV footage and messaging records on WhatsApp in connection with the violence. Advocate Rahul Mehra, Delhi Police Standing Counsel, said the agency had written to the JNU administration for footage of 135 CCTV cameras on the campus from January 3 to January 6.

Mr. Mehra added that the police had not received any response to the request. The police had also written for data regarding two WhatsApp groups that were allegedly used to plan and coordinate the attack.

‘Premeditated and coordinated’

The petition, filed by professors Ameet Parameswaran, Atul Sood, Shukla Vinayak Sawant, claimed that particulars of the January 5 incident “seem to indicate that the entire attack was premeditated and coordinated”. The professors also said that they had been personally injured in the violence.

“Unless the same had been the result of a pre-planned conspiracy, it would not have been possible for a mob in such large numbers, many of whom appear to be outsiders, to enter the JNU campus,” the plea said.

“The existence of a premeditated and well-organised attack is further clear from the fact that these persons were covering their faces wearing marks, without any proper identification, carrying weapons and so on,” it stated.

The plea submitted that several persons appear to have used WhatsApp to create different groups with the purpose of inciting hate and violence against the teachers, staff, and students of JNU.

The petition categorically sought the preservation of data of WhatsApp groups ‘Unity Against Left’ and ‘Friends of RSS’ including messages, pictures and videos as well as phone numbers of members related to the incident.

Senior advocates Rebecca John, Akhil Sibal and Gopal Sankaranarayanan represented the professors. Counsel submitted that they wanted the preservation of the CCTV footages and WhatsApp data on priority.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yj7e95/article30531831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10JNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-violence-high-court-notices-to-delhi-police-google-whatsapp-and-apple-on-preservation-of-data/article30556385.ece
279,2020/01/13,"End boycott, JNU tells faculty members protesting against Vice-Chancellor","With some faculty members of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) planning an academic boycott as a protest against Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar, the administration has issued an advisory to all teachers asking them to resume classes in the interest of the student community. It warned that a failure to do so violated their service contracts.

JNU Teachers Association representatives are expected to meet with Human Resource Development Ministry officials on Monday afternoon for further discussions to end the impasse. The JNUTA plans to submit a “dossier on the VC’s misdeeds,” according to their statement.

On Saturday, the JNUTA general body meeting issued a resolution to carry out a Non-Cooperation Action Plan.

“The resolution implies that we refuse to comply with the two circulars issued on January 10, which asked teachers to be present in their offices for registration, to start classes and other relevant academic activities from January 13 and to upload time-tables for the same,” said a statement from JNUTA president D.K. Lobiyal and secretary Surajit Mazumdar.

“The JNUTA appeals to all colleagues to implement fully these decisions of the General Body to express our outrage at the continuation of Professor M. Jagadesh Kumar as VC even after the mob violence of 5th January 2020, in which teachers were also targeted and several of our colleagues injured. We will not become a party to his attempts to create a fiction of ‘normalcy’ in the University that wishes away the real climate of fear and terror he has created.”

In response, JNU registrar Pramod issued an advisory saying that the non-cooperation call “reflects the intention of JNUTA to disrupt normal functioning of the university” and also violates the service contracts of teachers.

Noting that thousands of students have already registered for the winter semester, which begins on Monday, the advisory said that, “Students of JNU have their fundamental right to attend classes and get advice from their respective supervisors and fulfil academic requirements.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/g0n3fp/article30348369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/end-boycott-jnu-tells-faculty-members-protesting-against-vice-chancellor/article30556173.ece
280,2020/01/13,Will talk about work done by AAP in five years: Sanjay Singh,"Aam Aadmi Party’s Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson Sanjay Singh speaks to Nikhil M Babu about his party’s campaign strategy for the Assembly elections. Excerpts from the interview:

How will this election campaign be different from AAP’s previous ones?

This time we are focusing on the work done by the Delhi government in the past five years — what we have done in the fields of electricity, water, education, and healthcare — 200 units of free electricity, free water, free bus rides for women. We are talking about this with the people of Delhi. We have achieved more than our 70-point manifesto of 2015. The style of campaigning will be almost the same. Our main focus will be on door-to-door campaign.

What were the lessons your party learned from the setback in the Lok Sabha election?

The Lok Sabha election was fought on a different set of issues. What the Delhi government had done, the change it had brought in the lives of the people did not become a big issue. This time it will be a big issue.

This time the party is focusing heavily on local issues and not getting into national issues. Why?

Even last time, we talked about what our 49-day government was able to do. If you are fighting a State election, you should focus on State issues.

The party has not hit the ground with protests against CAA or violence in JNU. Why is that?

You didn’t listen to the statements made by the BJP? Without even our going there, they are blaming AAP for the violence. If Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had gone there, they would have blamed us even more. This is the reason. To appeal for peace, the best way is you stay at a distance and urge people to remain peaceful. If we go there, the BJP will create a conspiracy and trigger violence and blame it on us. As the Chief Minister, Mr. Kejriwal talked to Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal and also gave a statement. I went to AIIMS and other members of our party also went there.

In the next five years, what will AAP do if it comes back to power?

Water and pollution, these two are the major areas we will focus on. The other one is traffic.

AAP is a new party, compared to others. In these five years in power, what has the party learned? What has changed in the party?

I feel that many times we used to get worried about things very quickly and react. Now we have learnt that we will have to face many challenges. The Central government had put about 25 MLAs behind bars. And there were many CBI raids in the last five years. We have changed the way we react to this. We talk in a different way and take our side of the story to the people. We have learned that we need to focus fully on work and the people will reply to them.

AAP was formed from the fight against corruption movement. But talk about corruption has disappeared from the party in press conferences, election manifesto. Why?

Our government had passed the Jan Lokpal Bill, in which the Chief Minister was also covered. But the Central government has not approved it. Why are they scared? We used to investigate corruption cases with the anti-corruption branch, but the Centre took way the anti-corruption branch from us. The Delhi government has no agency to inquire into corruption matters.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-miscellaneous/tp-others/5jajtz/article29525792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26DELElection-G076GFT093jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/will-talk-about-work-done-by-aap-in-five-years/article30553081.ece
281,2020/01/13,"Five Nuh women go against all odds to study, show others way","Notwithstanding the penury, the deep-rooted social bias, stiff opposition from their own families and the lack of opportunities, five young Muslim women from Haryana’s Nuh, one of the hundred most backward districts in the country, decided not to bogged down and took all challenges head-on to realise their dream of seeking higher education for a better tomorrow.

May not be the “big” achievers, but hero in their own stories, these women have now been nominated as brand ambassadors of Nuh by former Sarpanch and two-time ‘Rashtriya Gaurav Gram Sabha Puraskar’ winner Sunil Jaglan for his foundation. The five will share their stories of grit to inspire the women in the region and create awareness among them on their rights, health and education.

“The tag of backward district needs to be shaken off Nuh. Wherever we go, we are reminded that we come from a backward region,” says Rizwana, one of the women, with a sense of resolve in her voice. She pursues General Nursing and Midwifery course from Charkhi Dadri, but her journey from an obscure Pipaka village of Nuh’s Tauru Block to the present day has not been an easy one, to say the least. Clad in a red hijab, the 19-year-old recalls how her parents borrowed money and sold off all their jewellery to pay for her studies. Though none in her family is literate, her father, a farmer, wanted her to become a nurse to serve people in Nuh — a district with an abysmal record on health infrastructure.

Wasima (20), pursuing law from Sonipat’s Bhagat Phool Singh Mahila Vishwavidyalaya (BPSMV), comes from an educated family but had a tough time persuading her parents to send her to hostel for higher studies. “Parents in Nuh don’t even send girls to neighbouring village fearing for their safety. Most girls drop out after senior secondary. Higher education is a dream for girls here,” says Wasima. She says the women in Nuh neglect their health and are not aware of their rights. “They are scared of everyone. They are not aware of their rights. I want to change this and create awareness among them working with Selfie With Daughter Foundation,” says Wasima, a resident of Ainchwari village.

Donning a red-jacket Shahnaz Bano, the eldest in the gang, held meetings with the women in around half-a-dozen villages neighbouring her Sakras village and spoke to them about their problems and rights as part of the nomination process. “During one such meeting I came to know how a Sarpanch’s family was opposed to their daughters going to school. They feared that the girls might marry men of her choice if allowed to go out. I convinced them that education was important and women today were making their mark in all fields,” says Bano, 25, who is pursuing MA (Urdu) from a Nuh college.

Juggling between her studies, job and coaching classes in Jaipur, Arastun, 21, a civil services aspirant, found it difficult to convince her parents to let her study after her elder sister chose to marry a man of her choice bringing a “bad name” to the family. But she had put her foot down. “I want people to know my father by my name. I am ready to face anything for it,” she says. “Girls are not less capable than boys. But how can they ask for their rights, when they don’t know about them. I want to work for their rights,” says Arastun, a resident of Bhond village. She blames the political class of Nuh for failing the women of the region.

Though her grandfather Islamuddin fought for women’s education all his life, Anjum Islam, 18, a second-year-law student at BPSMV, also faced opposition from her family when she expressed her desire to go to hostel for higher studies. But her mother stood up for her. “It is a male-dominated society. No equal opportunities for women,” says Islam, from Tain village, who wants to support more girls like her and help them realise their dream.

Besides lack of education opportunities and poor health, the five point out “dowry” and “sexual abuse” as two major concerns of the women in Nuh. “Parents consider girls as a liability because they need to pay dowry at the time of their marriage. They consider them to be paraya dhan [someone else’s property] and don’t want to spend on their education,” says Rizwana.

A science post-graduate, Mr. Jaglan, who is known for his ‘Selfie With Daughter’ campaign, said the five were shortlisted after a gruelling selection process requiring them to hold meetings in the villages and deliver speeches. “The five were selected from around a thousand of girls after several rounds of screening. It is their revolutionary spirit that strikes the most. We plan to have one such ambassador in each village later to spread the message of women empowerment,” he adds.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dkugbk/article30553075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12NUH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/five-nuh-women-go-against-all-odds-to-study-show-others-way/article30553076.ece

Mr. Tiwari claimed that the video was a reflection of AAP’s mere “desperation” to win the elections. By using Mr. Tiwari’s image in the said video, AAP proved that people liked him more than Mr. Kejirwal, the BJP said.

In a complaint to the CEO, the BJP’s State unit argued that it was a violation of the model code of conduct (MCC) as well as of the IT Act. The letter termed the video an attempt to malign the image of the party’s star campaigner.

The complaint highlighted that according to the MCC, criticisms of political opponents should stay limited to their policies, programmes and past work and that criticisms on all aspects of private life were to be refrained from and argued that the said video violated the provision.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/tiwari-serves-defamation-notice-on-cm/article30553063.ece

“When there was an outbreak of dengue in Delhi, the civic bodies created awareness on prevention and also trained staff, challaned violators. Mr. Kejriwal only issued costly advertisements,” Ms Lekhi said. She also hit out at the Delhi government for “taking credit” for the eastern and western peripheral highways that were, she said, constructed by the Centre.

She also said that the Centre had made an effort to instal airpurifiers, vacum cleaners in the city, whereas the Chief Minister did not show concern on the issue.

Mr. Mohaniya, speaking at the AAP office, said the water supplied by Haryana was contaminated as it had high ammonia content and hence the DJB production has decreased by 100 MGD. “The water supplied in Delhi comes from other States, in which Haryana is the largest source. After the announcement of polls, the amount of ammonia in the water coming from Haryana has increased a lot,” Mr. Mohaniya said.

He alleged that since Haryana was a BJP-ruled State, trying to affect the water supply in many parts of Delhi seemed to be a “political conspiracy” to defame the Delhi government.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/haryana-supplying-water-with-high-ammonia-content-djb-vice-chairman/article30553049.ece
285,2020/01/13,Cong. alleges corruption in civic bodies,"The Delhi Congress on Sunday alleged that there was widespread corruption in the three BJP-ruled civic bodies. Party’s State unit chief Subhash Chopra released a “corruption report” and said “no citizen in Delhi dares to go to civic body offices as no work can be done without bribing the officials”.

“The extent of corruption in the civic bodies is evident from the fact that the CAG report has not yet been tabled in the three Houses. Due to sealing, livelihood of lakhs of people was ruined. The municipal bodies have been collecting crores of rupees from people in the name of putting an end to sealing,” Mr. Chopra said.

The party said that out of 1,472 alleged corruption cases, internal audit has been conducted only in 77 in which corruption of ₹33 lakh was detected. “Had internal audit been done in all cases, corruption to the tune of ₹2,000 crore would have been unearthed,” Mr. Chopra said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cong-alleges-corruption-in-civic-bodies/article30553048.ece
286,2020/01/13,‘DDA hiking price of EWS houses a scam’,"AAP leader Sanjay Singh on Sunday alleged that the prices of houses for economically weaker section (EWS) beneficiaries, in a brochure in 2014, were increased by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) and that it was a “scam” that needed to be probed.

“Flats should have been made available for ₹6.90 lakh and ₹11 lakh in easy instalments. But the beneficiaries are now being told to pay ₹19 lakh and ₹24 lakh, which is thrice the amount originally announced,” Mr. Singh said. He asked as to why the DDA had put out advertisements of the scheme claiming that the flats were ready and then raise the cost later.

Mr Singh also demanded a thorough inquiry by the CBI and the CVC, adding that he had written to senior officials in both departments.

In response, the DDA said that the EWS flats being referred to have been built by DLF and that the price indicated in the brochure in 2014 was “tentative”. It said that a detailed calculation was done in 2019 and the cost worked out was communicated to the beneficiaries and on request, the DDA decided not to charge interest.

“Fifty per cent of EWS flats built by private developers are transferred to the DDA at price linked with CPWD index. Thereafter, the DDA offers these flats to eligible beneficiaries. The price charged by DDA is based on actual cost and the formula is approved by the authority,” the DDA said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dda-hiking-price-of-ews-houses-a-scam/article30553025.ece
287,2020/01/13,Concerned citizens take stock of illegal constructions on Haryana forest land,"Amid reports that Haryana Governor Satyadev Narayan Arya has given his consent to the amendment in the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), 1900, despite reservations expressed by the Supreme Court, a group of people, including filmmakers, photographers, MNC employees and students, led by environmentalists, took a tour of a few villages along Gurugram-Faridabad Road on Sunday to see the extent of illegal construction on forest land and understand the implications of the amendment for the region.

The group were aghast to find how farmhouses, banquet halls and even ashrams had come up on the land preserved under the PLPA, 1900, in flagrant violation of the law in Faridabad’s Ankheer, one of the villages they visited. However, what shocked them the most was that the plots with illegal constructions belonged to a former Haryana government Minister; senior, serving and retired bureaucrats; and even the relatives of Members of Parliament.

“The extent of illegal construction and the involvement of the bureaucrats, politicians and even judicial officials hint at the nexus. It is, therefore, not difficult to understand why the government wants to bring the amendments,” said Puja Ahmed, senior marketing manager, American Express.

Ms. Ahmed had come to live in Gurugram five years ago, but it was recently during conversation with her activist friend Roma, a Nirvana Country resident, that she learnt about the issues of waste management and the importance of Aravalis and decided to be part of the gang to visit the villages and get first-hand information. “The pace at which we are playing havoc with our environment, we cannot sustain for more than 50 years. I want to do my bit to protect the environment so that I can tell my 10-year-old daughter that I at least made an attempt,” said Ms. Ahmed, a Sector 47 resident.

Explaining the modus operandi of the violators, Vishnu, a local environment activist, said that the construction started in the guise of running a gaushala or building a temple to avoid complaints. “Most of these farmhouses have a couple of cows tied inside to make it look like a gaushala. Some have even built small temples,” said Mr. Vishnu. He told the visitors that the complaints were filed in a few cases, but were either withdrawn or action was not taken.

He told the visitors how a banquet hall was issued a Change in Land Use certificate despite the dispute over the ownership hinting at the nexus between the officials and the violators.

Roma Jaswal Vinayak, an entrepreneur, suggested that a spree of complaints and cases be filed and fought through crowd-funding. Neelam Ahluwalia, a development sector professional, video-recorded the violations to share with her friends on the social media and create awareness on the matter.

Environment analyst Chetan Agarwal, who led the group, said that around 75,000 acre of forest land in Haryana was protected under the PLPA, including 60,000-odd acre in Aravalis. “Though the Haryana government stated that if the PLPA was not amended, it would necessitate large-scale demolition of houses and buildings, it is not true. For instance, Akhneer with around 15 illegal structures has only 10% of the PLPA land under illegal construction. It is even less in most of the other areas. It can be easily demolished. The amendment will actually throw open the majority of the Aravalis to real estate development causing havoc with the ecology and the environment,” cautioned Mr. Agarwal.

He also explained as to how the construction and demolition waste and the soil was deliberately dumped along the Gurugram-Faridabad Road to bring it at the level of the road and then encroach it to illegally run dhabas and wine shops. “It is done gradually without alarming the administration,” said Mr. Agarwal.

Sunil, an environment activist from Mangar village, showed to the group a plot measuring around 6 acres in his village with construction being carried out in violation of the law. Ms. Sunil told that the owner of the land had cleared the vegetation on it gradually over the past few years despite repeated complaints and now fenced the area. The land is protected under the PLPA. But if this owner succeeds in carrying out the construction, it will lead to more such constructions on the protected forest land,” said Mr. Sunil.

Delhi University’s students — Sudhir Yadav, Ayush Poddar and Anurag Singh — and young ecologist Misha, a member of Mangar Eco Club, were also part of the group. Filmmaker Chander Moli and his architect friend Anu Sachdeva, an amateur wildlife photographer, also accompanied the team members. They also visited Mewla Maharajpur village in Faridabad that has more than two dozen illegal constructions on PLPA protected land. “We need to create awareness and put pressure on the government to withdraw such laws. An ‘Awareness Walk’ will be organised next week,” said Ms. Ahluwalia, a development sector professional.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/g8h6z5/article30553022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13LAND3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/concerned-citizens-take-stock-of-illegal-constructions-on-haryana-forest-land/article30553023.ece
288,2020/01/13,Plea seeking investigation into administration of Delhi Judicial Academy dismissed,"The Delhi High Court has disposed of a petition for investigation into the administration of Delhi Judicial Academy (DJA) over appointment of Professor Mrinal Satish to the post of chairperson of the academy.

Last month, Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal, on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, accepted the resignation of Mr. Satish from the post with effect from December 24, 2019.

The petition before the High Court had claimed that Mr. Satish was ineligible for the post. Earlier, the High Court had also sought response from Mr. Satish and DJA over the appointment.

The DJA is funded by the Delhi government and administratively controlled by the Delhi High Court. Judicial academies impart judicial education and training to judges.

NGO AGAM, in its petition filed through advocate Ashutosh Kumar Mishra, had claimed that the appointment of Mr. Satish was in violation of the prescription under the Delhi Judicial Academy (Appointment, Conditions of Service, and Conduct) Rules, 2008.

The NGO had contended that as per information available on the website of the National Law University, Mr. Satish’s experience as a professor cannot be of more than one-and-a-half years from the date of the appointment.

Mr. Mishra said that the minimum qualification for the post of chairperson is that the person has been a judge of a High Court, or is a distinguished academician having teaching experience of not less than twenty-five years as a lecturer, and experience as a Professor of Law of not less than seven years.

The plea alleged that Mr. Satish was “illegally and arbitrarily” appointed as the DJA chairperson while seeking “investigation into the administration of the DJA”.

“The appointment of the respondent no.4 [Satish] by by-passing the mandatory condition of the vacancy circular dated August 20, 2018 is a patent illegality committed at the hand of the search committee,” the plea had said.

289,2020/01/13,"Start pension scheme for staff, HC tells Bhartiya Chikitsa Parishad","The High Court has ordered the Delhi Bhartiya Chikitsa Parishad, which maintains register of Ayurvedic and Unani practitioners here, to introduce pension system for its employees.

Justice A.K. Chawla said that the decision should be taken within six months considering that it requires due consideration of various financial aspects by the Parishad, Delhi government and the Centre.

Justice Chawla ordered the authorities “to take a decision to introduce Pension Scheme to the employees of the Parishad from a date to be fixed and in doing so, the benefit of pension may be extended to the existing and also the retired/superannuated employees, as an exception”.

The High Court’s decision came on a plea by a former employee of the Parishad seeking to extend the pension rules as applicable to employees of Delhi government to the Parishad employees.

Previously, the Parishad was known as the Board of Ayurvedic and Unani System of Medicine (AUSM), which was constituted under East Punjab Ayurvedic and Unani Practitioners Act, 1949. Later, with the introduction of the Delhi Bhartiya Chikitsa Parishad Act, 1998, the Parishad substituted AUSM.

The plea claimed that the rules and regulations governing the employees of Delhi government were applicable to Parishad staff in all service matters. It claimed that the Parishad forms part of the State and hence the conditions of service and the rules and the regulations governing the employees of Delhi government were applicable to the employees of the Parishad.

The Parishad, however, claimed that it was an autonomous body and governed by its own rules and regulations. It also said that currently it was a self sustaining body, which was not beneficiary of grants-in-aid from the Delhi government since financial year 2012-13.

“When employees of the Parishad are shown to be beneficiaries under the Contributory PF Scheme, why they should not be extended the benefit of pension, does require due consideration,” the court said.

“A consideration on the given aspect cannot be denied on the premise that the Parishad, as of now, was a self-sustaining body, without being the beneficiary of grants-in-aid as contended on its behalf. The statutory provisions cannot be ignored on the given premise,” the HC noted.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/start-pension-scheme-for-staff-hc-tells-bhartiya-chikitsa-parishad/article30552998.ece
290,2020/01/13,HC issues guidelines for appointing guardians,"An individual who seek to be appointed as guardian for a person lying in comatose state will have to first approach the court for thorough verification, the Delhi High Court has said while issuing a slew of guidelines on the issue.

Justice Rajiv Shakdher, in a significant ruling, said the guidelines framed by the Kerala High Court can be used as a framework for formulating guidelines that need to be applied in Delhi.

The guidelines state that a person who seek to be appointed as guardians shall in his or her petition to the court disclose the details of all tangible and intangible assets of such an individual. The court will then have the person lying in comatose examined by a duly constituted medical board which would include a neurologist.

The court will also direct the Sub-divisional Magistrate concerned or Tehsildar in whose jurisdiction the person lying in comatose is said to be located to carry out an enquiry to establish the veracity of the assertion. It will also gather material particulars concerning the person who approach the court for being appointed as guardians.

Any conflict of interest concerning the affairs of the person lying in comatose state will be brought to the fore in the report generated during the course of enquiry, the guideline said.

“Ordinarily only that person will be appointed as guardian who is a spouse or a progeny of the person lying in comatose,” the guideline said.

In the event, the person lying in comatose has neither a spouse nor any children or even any legal heirs or if he/she has such persons in his life but stands abandoned by them, subject to the permission of the court his next friend who wishes to be appointed as a guardian can approach the court with such a request.

Alternative measure

As an alternative measure, the court could also direct the Department of Social Welfare, Delhi government to appoint a public official such as a Social Welfare Officer or a person holding equivalent rank to act as the guardian of the person lying in comatose state. The person appointed as a guardian will have to submit every six months or within such period as the court may indicate in its order a report with the Registrar General of the High Court.

The report should have details of the transactions undertaken by the guardian in respect of the assets of the person lying in comatose state, the High Court said.

The court order came on a petition by daughters of a woman, who is in comatose state, seeking access to the Public Provident Fund which was opened and maintained by their deceased father.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4nq1m0/article30552994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL13-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-issues-guidelines-for-appointing-guardians/article30552995.ece

292,2020/01/13,BJP to fight Delhi polls on national and local issues,"The BJP’s bid to instal a “triple engine government [same party at the Centre, State and municipal corporation level]” in the Capital will involve a delicate balance between raising national and local issues, say party insiders.

Addressing a rally at Ramlila Maidan on December 22, 2019, to kick off his party’s campaign for the Delhi Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had attacked the Congress and other Opposition parties for spreading “lies and rumours” about the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and detention centres.

He barely touched upon local issues such as ownership rights for residents of illegal colonies or quality of potable water.

The rally was held on the eve of the Jharkhand election results where the BJP had followed its tested poll strategy to raise mainly national issues. The BJP ended up winning only 25 of the 81 Assembly seats in the State.

A fortnight after Mr. Modi’s rally, BJP national president Amit Shah addressed booth-level workers in Delhi and said that national issues such as ‘surgical strike following Pulwama attack’ and the CAA were at the core of the party’s electoral campaign.

Strategy shift

But the Union Home Minister also indicated a shift in the party’s campaign strategy.

Mr. Shah also talked about the “negative and obstructionist politics” of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal in relation to non-implementation of Central government schemes in Delhi. In a departure from the past, Mr. Shah directly attacked Mr. Kejriwal, indicating the electoral significance of countering “AAP’s work”.

“Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and Arvind Kejriwal opposed the abolition of Article 370 and 35A, Triple Talaq, decision of Supreme Court on Ram temple, surgical strike and air strike done to avenge the Uri and Pulwama attack,” Mr. Shah had said.

“We wanted to send the anti-national elements who raised slogans like “Bharat tere tukde tukde honge” in JNU to jail, but Kejriwal did not grant permission to prosecute them... We want to grant citizenship to Dalits and Sikh refugees but anti-Dalit AAP and Congress opposed it,” he had said.

He exhorted party workers to undertake a door-to-door campaign to apprise people of “the achievements of the Modi government and the fraud of the Kejriwal government”.

Party insiders said the campaign was supposed to revolve around seamless governance at all three levels of administration in Delhi, resting squarely on the shoulders of PM Modi, as it sought to make the Assembly elections “mostly national”.

This approach will now be tweaked keeping in mind several happenings in a city where governments and issues intersect, they added.

Party line

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari took the party’s line forward and attacked the Congress and AAP of creating an atmosphere of “confusion and falsehood regarding CAA”.

“The frustrated Opposition parties are trying to push the youth into anarchy for its electoral gains by creating an atmosphere in Jamia and JNU, which is very condemnable... Whatever claims Kejriwal will make of having given benefits during the last five years, the BJP will do at least five times more work for the people of Delhi,” he said.

BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel said both national and local issues were driving the party’s campaign in the Capital, which was being carried out “under the leadership of PM Modi”. “The party cannot turn away from the fact that lies are deliberately being spread about CAA. As far as local issues are concerned, the party is not only telling citizens about the work done by the Modi-led Centre but also seeking suggestions that will be part of our vision document,” he said.

Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta said both national and local issues were of “equal importance” and the party was working towards addressing the concerns of citizens on both fronts as part of its campaign.

“The AAP government had deliberately created obstructions in Phase IV of the Delhi Metro project, construction of the Regional Rapid Transit System as well as conferment of ownership rights to residents of unauthorised colonies. These were among the many Central-sponsored schemes aimed at bettering the lives of the people of the Capital, but blocked due to petty politics... we will tell the people about this,” he added.

New approach

After the defeat in Jharkhand, the initial strategy has been “modified” to a large extent, said sources.

A cross-section of leaders and sources told The Hindu that the party, which has been out of power in Delhi for over two decades, had initially sought to embark upon an aggressive, mainly national, electoral campaign. It will now be “relatively muted” and “more multi-faceted”, they said.

The upcoming election has been quickly pegged by the party as a direct battle between PM Modi and CM Kejriwal — by erecting over 21,000 hoardings bearing the PM’s face to reinforce his claim of having “removed the blot of being unauthorised” from the foreheads of the residents of 1,731 colonies.

Party insiders said the move was taken not only due to the loss in Jharkhand but also because of the lesson it learnt by projecting a “CM face” in the last Assembly elections. It had projected Kiran Bedi as the CM face.

Subsequent steps in regard to its “evolving” strategy are in line with ongoing Assembly seat-specific surveys, which have revealed that the average voter is “not as responsive” to criticism of the AAP government’s power and water subsidy schemes as expected, said a leader.

But the voters were “very enthused” with criticism of the allegedly obstructionist attitude of the AAP government when it came to the blocking of Central-sponsored schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, the leader said, adding: “They ask what the BJP has to offer over and above AAP’s subsidies – mainly freebies – and services which have benefited them since it came to power.”

A senior party leader said that while freebies were strictly “out of the question”, the BJP was not averse to subsidising power, water and public transport for “specific categories” of citizens based on socio-economic criteria.

Clarifying “doubts” regarding the CAA, countering the “anti-national” ways of the “tukde-tukde gang” and criticising alleged attempts to “spread violence” by AAP and the Congress, who were “instigating the minority community” in the name of the NRC, will be the main components of the national bit.

Air pollution, quality of potable water and questioning the AAP government’s claims on health, public transportation and education will be the local issues that the party will focus on, the leader said.

“When the party president himself hits the ground as part of a public awareness campaign revolving around the CAA, it is evidence enough of how significant an issue it is for the party. However, the local leadership has been directed to keep its own campaign within the spectrum of local issues and when it comes to the CAA, to mainly take forward the campaign initiated by Mr. Shah,” a source said.

“It would be wrong to say that the CAA and the NRC will not be electoral factors for the party in Delhi. But it would also be incorrect to say that these will be the only issues on the basis of which we will seek votes,” a senior party leader added.

Another senior leader said that a month was a long time in politics and the party’s strategy would continue to evolve due to the “significant decisions” taken by the Modi government over the last six months.

A senior leader said that the conferment of ownership rights to the residents of unauthorised colonies and the in-situ rehabilitation of slum clusters would remain the mainstay of its campaign as they represented “an intersection” of both national and local political issues as well as “evidence” of the BJP “delivering on the promises it makes”.

Subsidy schemes

“As far as the AAP government’s subsidy schemes are concerned, the BJP is more likely to modify them in a way that is sustainable as well as ensures that they benefit those depending on socio-economic criteria instead of a free-for-all in lieu of their votes,” the leader added.

Academician and political analyst Manisha Priyam said the PM’s face was the party’s best bet. “The Lok Sabha election saw the BJP sweeping all seven seats in the city in the name of the PM... Given the fact that the Delhi BJP unit does not have a leader who can cater to the average Delhiite, the PM’s face is certainly the party’s best bet,” he said.

Professor Pradip Kumar Datta of the Centre for Comparative Politics & Political Theory, School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, said the BJP’s dilemma stemmed from the “constituency specific” appeal of its local leaders. “Like the Congress, the BJP, as a large national party, has not allowed any local leader to become popular enough to be its face in Delhi. The BJP’s winning card was and remains Mr. Modi. But his magic seems to be waning,” he said.

While the issue of unauthorised colonies was a big advantage for the BJP and could offset the AAP’s advantage in terms of the work it had done in regard to schools and the city’s health sector, he said, the BJP was currently amidst a “crisis of credibility” given the larger scenario prevailing in the country.

“There is an undeclared economic crisis, there is the issue of jobs and prices of commodities; remember – the price of onions brought a government down in this very city – but these issues do not seem to be reflecting as a concern for the government. This has created a crisis of credibility,” he said further.

The ‘Modi card’, Professor Datta added, would work among the middle class and upper middle class but the need of the hour for the BJP was “a wave” which could only a possibility given a “communal conflagration.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/zcl3c6/article30552974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13DEBJP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-to-fight-delhi-polls-on-national-and-local-issues/article30552978.ece

297,2020/01/13,Man arrested at railway station with over 90 kg ganja,"A 24-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly carrying ganja packed inside iron cylinders at New Delhi Railway Station, the police said on Sunday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Railways) Harendra Singh said 96.5 kg ganja was recovered from Usman, a resident of Samaipur Badli.

On Friday at 11 p.m., Head Constable Sandeep Kumar was on patrolling duty at platform number 16 when he saw a man pushing a wooden cart with six iron cylinders on it.

“A cylinder fell on the ground and suspicious material came out of it. On checking, the material was found to be ganja,” Mr. Singh said.

The official then informed other policemen who came to the spot and nabbed Usman. The receipt for delivery of this parcel was issued in the accused’s name, the police said, adding that Usman also got a gate pass issued for transporting the cylinders from the station.

The ganja was packed inside the cylinders, which were sealed with iron lids. “The cylinders were smeared with grease. The cylinders came from Howrah in Kolkata and Usman was tasked to collect it from the station and further transport it,” the DCP said.

During interrogation, Usman said he met a man named Krish in Burari about a month ago who lured him to work for him. “He took his ID and also gave him a mobile phone for the purpose. The consignment was booked in the accused’s name by one Firoze in Howrah. The cylinders came to Delhi via the Poorva Express train. After taking the delivery from the parcel office at NDRS, he had to deliver it to Krish,” Mr. Singh added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/man-arrested-at-railway-station-with-over-90-kg-ganja/article30552947.ece
298,2020/01/13,"Tharoor addresses CAA protesters at Jamia Millia Islamia, calls for unity","Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday addressed a large group of protesters opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at Jamia Millia Islamia, lauding their “spirit of resistance” and called for unity.

‘Undemocratic efforts’

“What has happened to bring us to this point is the undemocratic and discriminatory efforts by the government to marginalise one community in India,” said Mr. Tharoor.

“As it is often said na mera hai na tera hai, yeh hindustan sabka hai. Aur na samjhenge ye baat toh nuksan sabka hai [This is not mine or yours, India is for everyone. If you don’t get this then everyone will be affected],” he said.

He said Mahatma Gandhi had died for the unity of the countryand “the India that Gandhi fought for is not the India where we will see religion being introduced into citizenship”.

The leader said Home Minister Amit Shah’s submissions in the parliament that the “discriminatory CAA” would be followed by the National Register of Citizens (NRC), cannot be accepted because the NRC would “put the onus on only one community to prove it’s citizenship.”

“This is not the India that people like Subhash Chopra [Delhi Congress chief] and I will ever accept. We want an India where everyone is equal, everyone is free...You can be Muslim, Hindu, Christian, Sikh, it does not matter. If you are an Indian, you have the same rights, the same privileges, the same duties,” he added.

‘A fight for all’

He said Jamia has always been one of the greatest universities in the country “but today, the greatest thing about Jamia, is your spirit. Your spirit of resistance. We stand with you, with the courage you have shown. This is a fight for all. Stay together, succeed together, live together, dream the same dream together. Jai Hind,” he said.

299,2020/01/13,SCR-SBI ink pact for smart banking at stations,"South Central Railway (SCR) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with State Bank of India (SBI) in connection with doorstep banking for direct pick up of earnings covering all 585 railway stations.

The pact was inked by senior officials of both organisations in the presence of General Manager Gajanan Mallya on Monday. The direct pick up of cash from the railway stations dispenses with the tedious and complex activity of movement of cash earnings through “cash safes” by trains.

It will enable hassle-free collection of traffic earnings and remittance into government account avoiding delay in transmission of traffic cash earnings. The MoU was signed by chief commercial manager, freight services B.S. Christopher and financial advisor and chief accounts officer J. Meghanath for SCR and deputy GM — digital and transaction banking unit, SBI-Hyd circle Surendra Nayak.

In the present digital age, pace of financial transactions is important and the on-time remittances will accrue gain for SCR, said Mr. Mallya. At present, earnings generated at smaller railway stations each day are sent through cash bag dropped in the cash chest available with the guard of the nominated trains.

In case of major stations, earnings are remitted by the concerned commercial supervisor at the nominated nearest banks with Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel accompany the official providing security as well as transportation. This method had scope for delays like holidays, availability of manpower, cash chest and so on.

The pact will ensure all railway stations have uniform cash remittance mechanism, real time information about the cash being deposited by different stations which will help in better supervision and accountability. Top SCR and SBI officials were present.

Later, Mr. Mallya presented “Man of the Month” safety awards to 14 employees for showing alertness in the duty and taking timely action to prevent unsafe conditions. Safety should be the top priority in running of trains during the festival season, he reminded divisional managers in a video-conference.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/24bxtr/article30561289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy13SBI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/scr-sbi-ink-pact-for-smart-banking-at-stations/article30561291.ece
300,2020/01/13,Kite and Sweet festival begins on a high note,"Curtains went up on the fifth edition of the International Kite and Sweet Festival at the Parade Grounds here on Monday.

Inaugurating the festival, Minister for Municipal Adminstration and Urban Development K.T. Rama Rao spoke about Hyderabad being a mini-India with its food choices and culture. “India is a country of unity in diversity. Hyderabad is a cosmopolitan city that makes everyone feel home. This festival is a slice of India where people can come and experience the offerings of the whole country in a span of three or four hours,” said Mr. Rao.

Minister of Cinematography, T. Srinivas Yadav, who also visited the festival, said, “Whenever we start something new, there is great demand for it. It helps the economy. The number of visitors keeps going up and this year too, we expect more visitors than last year. An event like this helps Hyderabad’s brand.”

The vast Parade Grounds bore a festive look on Monday evening as families began walking in. Some had boxes of food that they planned to hawk at the stalls while others came just to see the kites flying and to taste the savouries. “We have 500 stalls by people who wanted to show the food items of their regions. Foreign participation in the kite festival is also high as teams from 20 countries have signed up for it,” said Tourism Secretary Burra Venkatesham.

301,2020/01/13,Police more watchful about flash protests,"Series of flash protests followed by large-scale impromptu gathering under Tolichowki flyover on Sunday night has put police officials on high alert. While they are vigilant about such gatherings, Joint Commissioner of Police (West Zone) A.R. Srinivas maintained that they became more watchful after Sunday’s flash protest, which took more than seven hours for the police to dissolve the gathering.

From little over three weeks, people started to stage flash protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC), National Population Register (NPR), in various parts of the State capital, including communally sensitive Old City. On New Year eve too, a group of youngsters holding placards against CAA, NRC, NPR, staged agitation near NTR Gardens.

However, the impromptu gathering at Tolichowki drew the attention of the masses as information was circulated on social media, urging people to come and participate. However, the space under the flyover was not the only choice for the gathering. Protesters said that they decided on it from four options: Dharna Chowk, Saidabad, Khilwat Ground and Tolichowki.

Anticipating such protests in days to come, the officer said “firm action will be taken against those who resort to such acts in future. Taking law into their hands cannot be accepted.”

Mr. Srinivas said that they are more watchful after the Tolichowki incident.

Speaking to The Hindu, another officer said that the police can prevent protests if they get specific information from sources or they physically see people gathering at a place. “If we get advance information, we can take people into preventive custody provided there is adequate time,” he said. When asked if the police would set up pickets during this period to prevent flash protest, the officer said they cannot anticipate when and where such gatherings might be held.

“With lack of workforce, we cannot establish pickets everywhere. However, there are pickets at sensitive locations in some parts of the city and our patrol teams extensively cover all areas,” the officer maintained.

However, police said that they will maintain vigil at some of the places where such gatherings are expected to be held.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/police-more-watchful-about-flash-protests/article30561154.ece
302,2020/01/13,Shaheen Bagh-type protest nipped in the bud in Hyderabad,"An attempt to turn an open space under Tolichowki flyover as ‘Shaheen Bagh’ of Hyderabad was nipped in the bud early morning on Monday. A group of women and a few men initiated a flash protest under the flyover on Sunday night. The women who convened there said that they were inspired by the women in Shaheen Bagh (Delhi) who were protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Registry of Citizens (NRC), and National Population Register (NPR).

Though more people gathered, the protest got dissolved at around 4 a.m. as police detained 61 persons (all men). Permission was not granted to hold the protest. They were let off on Monday morning after issuing notices under CrPC Section 41 (A). Women were not detained as it was night. One of the protesters, Syed Jalaluddin, said that out of four places in the city, they chose Tolichowki for the protest. The decision was taken on Sunday evening and messages were circulated on Whatsapp inviting people to join the protest under the flyover. The agitation started at around 9 p.m.

“When women constables started to detain women protesters at around 11.50 p.m., people living in and around Tolichowki started to gather. They formed a human chain around the protesters,” said Zaid Najeeb, who was trying to pacify people under the flyover. In the middle of the night, a group of close to 20 women sat down close to each other. Women constables stood beside them and male protesters encircled all of them in an attempt to stop detention by police. Joint Commissioner of Police (West Zone) A.R. Srinivas and others were present at the site.

“We are Indian citizens and we can convene at any place, whenever we want to. Our plan is to make a place as ‘Shaheen Bagh’ in Hyderabad. CAA, NRC are unconstitutional, they have to be rolled back. We will not take a step back from protesting,” said Syeda Sheemah, who was one of the women protesting under the flyover. An activist, Shiba, said on Sunday midnight that they plan to stage indefinite protest, but are under extreme pressure to end it.

While women continued to stage a sit-in, men stayed put around them. Additionally, a few more people gathered on the flyover. Police started to arrest the men at around 4 a.m. Golconda Police inspector K Chandra Shekar Reddy said that they detained 61 people.

Cases under IPS Sections 143, 341, 290, read with 149 of IPC, and 21/76 of Hyderabad City Police Act were registered against Khaled Parveen, one of the protesters, and others. All those who were detained were let off after notices were served under Section 41 A of CrPC.

304,2020/01/13,Lead can be cause of Alzheimer’s disease: NIN study,"Lead is a common pollutant that can get into the environment from a number of commonly used materials like paints, cosmetics, batteries, glass and low-grade toys. Its role as a risk factor in development of neuro-degenerative diseases is established globally.

Recent studies conducted at ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) have now established the possible link between lead exposure and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) where brain cells processing, storing and helping recollect information degenerate and slowly die. Although the underlying cause of this destruction is not completely known, a prime suspect is a microscopic brain protein fragment called ‘beta-amyloid’ which disrupts communication between cells and leads to their death.

Research showed that the central nervous system is the most vulnerable to minute levels of lead-induced toxicity and it has been linked to AD as a probable risk factor though its specific role is still not clear. A team led by ICMR-NIN’s senior scientist Dr. Suresh Challa is unravelling the molecular mechanism behind both lead and beta amyloid peptide induced toxicity in AD through in vitro studies.

“Alzheimer’s has a complex patho-physiology involving formation of beta amyloid plaques, tangles in brain, oxidative stress and inflammation leading to loss of memory and neuronal cell death. Our study investigated the basic mechanism behind the involvement of Lead in AD,” said Dr. Suresh Challa.

The scientists simulated brain cells in vitro with beta amyloid peptides like in AD and the effect of lead exposure was then studied. It showed increased cell death and that proteins involved in neuro-development and regeneration were depleted, leading to loss of memory as in AD.

“Maternal exposure to lead during pregnancy could cause higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease in later life of the child. The current findings could be another piece in solving the puzzle towards understanding the AD to develop preventive and management strategies for elderly,” said NIN director Dr. R Hemalatha.

Research also showed that the therapeutic potential of natural compounds like ‘Epigallocatechin Gallate’ (EGCG) present in green tea, guava leaves, apples, cherries, pears, black berries - possessing antioxidants, have shown to have preventive potential against lead toxicity. Further studies are on, a press release said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lead-can-be-cause-of-alzheimers-disease-nin-study/article30560849.ece

306,2020/01/13,Clean Harbors opens new Global Capability Centre in Hyderabad,"US environmental services firm Clean Harbors Inc. on Monday formally opened a new, 600-seat Global Capability Centre (GCC) in Hyderabad. It has also announced plans to explore the Indian market for its products and services.

Upbeat about the prospects in India, especially Hyderabad, where Clean Harbors has been operating for nine years, initially through partners and since 2017 by way of a GCC, Chairman and CEO Alan McKim said: “We intend to study the market as well as the regulatory environment in the country.”

The Boston-headquartered over $3.3 billion firm operates in the US, and a few other countries. It provides hazardous waste transportation and disposal, laboratory chemical packing, 24-hour emergency response, parts cleaning, and field, energy and industrial services.

A recycling opportunity

While not committing any timeline for the study, for bringing products and services to India, Mr.McKim said the plan is make a beginning with the launch of re-refined oil.

In North America, the company collects around 250 million gallons of waste oil (discarded from automobiles) annually. “We re-refine and sell it to customers. That is something we could do here, sell [recycled] oil back to industries and consumer through distributors and JV kind of partners. Hopefully that will be an opportunity for us to grow our sustainability products here,” he said in a media interaction at the new GCC.

Open to acquisitions

The approach will be to first test market with the product and then set up processing infrastructure for the used oil. The company, with 65 acquisitions thus far globally, is also open to acquiring companies in India in the waste management space, Mr.McKim said.

“Our predominant focus is on waste treatment and disposal, waste recycling. We are the largest recycler of oil and solvents, recycle computer parts for precious metals and also handle medical waste. Companies that are offering those kind of services are already here [in India], might be good candidates for us to talk from an acquisition standpoint,” he said.

For now, however, the focus is on getting the GCC up and running, he said, adding the scope to grow the GCC was big.

Country Manager Clean Harbors India LLP Avinash Samrit said: “From multiple locations in Hyderabad, the GCC operations has been consolidated at the new, nearly 70,000 sq ft facility. The headcount is a little over 300 and within the next 12-18 months, 300 more people are to be hired.

309,2020/01/13,The century-old houses of Chennai’s Mylapore were built to survive,"Puzzled faces peep out the windows of the upper floors of the century-old houses nestling wall-to-wall at Kutchery Road in Mylapore. In return, the large crowd gathered on the narrow road looks up, not at their bemused expressions, but at the Art-Deco style of the grilled windows.

“Look at the rejection of extreme ornamentation, the celebration of geometry, straight lines, and arches,” points out Tahaer Zoyab, suggesting that the houses may have been built in the 1920s, when the Art-Deco movement originated.

As part of Mylapore Festival, the architect, along with the Madras Inherited team, is leading a curated walk exploring vintage houses of Mylapore.

At 7 am on Sunday, we start from the Rasi Silk Store off Kutchery Road, checking out agraharam houses. The houses on this street are built linearly — with expanded interiors that allow ample circulation of light and air — so as to best make use of the limited space.

In one of the houses on Nadu Street, the home-owners — an old couple — greet us volunteering to share information about their home. In a feeble but eager voice, the lady of the house talks about how they still use water from their well and how long their home is. “It is like the Brindavan Express inside: compartment after compartment,” she quips.

Tahaer shares his “jugaad tricks” to identify the age of a house: “It is easy to assess how old it is by looking at the material used. For example, if it has pot tiles, it could be close to a century or older, because after that, the Mangalore tiles became popular. Another trick is to check if the balcony has cast iron handrails, which implies it is from before the 1930s.”

Additional floors began to be built, after this period. “You see how narrow the staircases generally are? That is because they were an addition once we figured out how to build on top.”

The ground floor was generally the office space, while the family lived upstairs. Drawing our attention to the vertical posts outside most houses, he says, “This is where they would hang signages for the offices.” Moreover, if you look at some of the signages in the nearby shops, some of them still have landline numbers with six or five digits -- in that sense, they are stuck in time.

Innovative techniques

The houses surrounding Kutchery Road used Burma teak, many of them over 100 years old and still not requiring repainting. Walls are made from lime plaster, which may feel rough to the touch but have great properties of thermal insulation. The wall-to-wall construction as well as the the red oxide tiles both keep the air cool.

To understand this better, we step inside a century-old house, owned by Neeraj Vaid from Ajmer. The dusty, two-floored building, currently uninhabited, has Madras Terrace roofing, Chettinad-style tiles in one room, and the most striking of all: a central courtyard, letting in sunlight blinking through the bars. “Many of these courtyards are a refuge for sparrows. Their world is the courtyard itself, which is ironic because it was the world for humans too. It used to be a social space but today it is utilitarian, like for drying clothes,” says Tahaer.

The Madras Terrace roofing was an important innovation, as it helped build new floors without having to introduce pillars. The parallel wooden beams and flat bricks laid diagonally to each other, helped distribute weight so that we could have flat roofs, adding more terrace area.

We pass by more houses, sporting windows with beautifully coloured glass panes imported from Belgium. (Imagine the light streaming in the morning and late afternoons). Meanwhile, spouts, to let off rainwater, are in the shape of animal heads.

This area also boasts of remarkable planning. “It does not get flooded because of the planned elevation and the presence of multiple tanks. That is the reason why land prices will always be high here.”

Given the limited space, and now the additional issue of parking, houses in this area have taken to growing vertically, breaking the general unwritten agreement that the gopuram of the nearby temple should be the tallest point in the area.

On Arundale Street, we spot a cream-coloured building with a lion head crest, distinctive to Dutch architecture. It has arched windows and small coves, for birds to perch. A broken pillar similar to that of the house beside, suggests that once upon a time, the street was witness to similiar architecture.

Despite the association of Mylapore with temples, the region is more cosmopolitan than it is given credit for. As we move to Devadi Street, Tahaer explains, “There is one theory that says the name was inspired by ‘deodi’, which in Urdu means archway. The area has had Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Jains; all living peacefully within a two-kilometre radius.”",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6w9kje/article30558162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HERITAGEWALKVINTAGEHOUSESMYLAPOREFESTIVAL4,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-century-old-houses-of-chennais-mylapore-were-built-to-survive/article30558163.ece
310,2020/01/13,Patricia Rozario tells Chennai about art song sessions,"It wasn’t just another Saturday afternoon for people passing by KM Music Conservatory, as lyrics by Ralph Vaughan Williams resonated in the air. On campus, a classical piece being played on an acoustic piano and resonating all around is common. Today, however, the sound was that of internationally acclaimed soprano Patricia Rozario and pianist Mark Troop, reciting an art song. It was for the inauguration of the Art Song Festival — a concert by KM Music Conservatory to raise awareness of Western classical art song in India.

Art song is an important tradition in Western classical music, and can be loosely described as music set to an independent text or poem in a concert setting. It is usually composed for a duo — a singer and pianist. Patricia is a gold medallist from London’s Guildhall School of Music and Drama, who teaches at the Royal College of Music and Trinity Laban in London. Mark Troop is a pianist, broadcaster and writer, and founder of the Chamber Music Company (CMC).

Many entered the dimly-lit auditorium, and instantly got lost in euphoria, as Mark played a legato run and reached a crescendo, while Patricia recited ‘Oh quand je Dors’ (Oh when I sleep) by Franz Liszt. The couple nailed every note with ease.

The recitals were followed by a master class — a common practice in the West, where students perform a piece and a master looks for technical errors in the presence of an audience. The students then play the piece again until they attain perfection. Three advanced-level students, KM alumni Bhavani Gayathri Devi, Divya Iyer and Jaganjot Randhawa performed pieces by Alban Berg, Franz Schubert and Paolo Tosti.

The afternoon ended with recitals by Nina Kanter, director of the festival and faculty member at the conservatory. Accompanied by pianist Adam Greig, the academic coordinator, she recited ‘Silent Noon’ by Ralph Vaughan Williams. It is a poetic description of an hour the poet spent with his lady love, in silence.

In Chennai for a year, Nina feels that the Western classical scene is in a not-so-good state in the city. “Classical music deals with universal stories that anyone can relate to. We have to provide opportunities for students to get exposed to the genre,” says Nina, who feels that the genre seems irrelevant to today’s generation in India because of a lack of exposure alone.

311,2020/01/13,"Now, an app that ‘schedules’ your day during kutcheri season","At the end of a dance performance last week in the city, a rasika (fan) walked up to the person manning the ‘Eppo Event’ stall, and told him this: “I wouldn’t have come here if not for you.”

Bhaskar Srinivasan beams as he narrates this tale. It is exactly the kind of response that he imagined receiving when he, and his friend Viswanathan Subramanian, started a mobile application for iOS and Android phones. Their venture — Eppo Event — provides a calendar for Margazhi’s concerts.

They chose Margazhi season because both are Carnatic music rasikas. “There are many apps in the market,” Bhaskar says, adding, “But a lot of them are updated only during the season. We want Eppo Event to be a 365-day worldwide platform, where multiple things can happen.”

One of the unique things about the application, according to Viswanathan, is its daily scheduler feature. “When we started R&D on the app, the first thing we thought about was the primary challenge to any rasika — not knowing which sabha to go to because there were just too many performances.” For this reason, the application came out with a ‘scheduler’ feature — a list that is made according to the user’s artiste preferences and location. This helps the user to have a smooth day at the sabhas.

With close to 3,500 downloads, they are looking to scale up before coming back in full strength for next December.

After a close association with ‘Kovai-yil Thiruvaiyaaru’, and other events in neighbouring States like Kerala and Karnataka, the two US-based founders are also eyeing the US market. “We will continue focussing on the Carnatic front, and hope to bridge the gap between the rasika and the artiste. We want our users to keep coming back,” adds Bhaskar.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/vkqhih/article30557223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MPeppoevent1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/kutcheri-talk-wheres-the-next-event-happening/article30557225.ece
312,2020/01/13,Varun Grover’s poem ‘Hum kagaz nahin dikhayenge’ will be set to music: Rahul Ram,"“I think climate change is pretty much irreversible. All we can do is maybe mitigate it a little bit or push it by 10 or 20 years,” says bassist of fusion rock band Indian Ocean and activist Rahul Ram. He was, in Bengaluru on January 5 to perform at Submerge, Science Gallery Bengaluru’s first exhibition season.

MetroPlus caught up with the unpretentious Delhi-based artiste at his chikkamma’s house on a quiet street in Jayanagar.

To the question of whether there is increased awareness about climate change and related issues, particularly in light of the visible activism of people such as Greta Thunberg, he says, “We are lucky that in India there are no climate change deniers. What we do have is central leadership that is not particularly aware or concerned about it. The government needs to run an awareness campaign. I don’t think the media is up to it because frankly, it is not very exciting and full of gloom.”

Adding that people also feel powerless in the face of climate change, Rahul says, “Even if you tell people things have to change, they will ask, ‘But what can little me do?’. Little me can just begin by consuming less of everything. Consume less electricity, use public transport… These are concrete things that you can tell people to do.”

The musician who has been a part of Indian Ocean since 1991 is also known for his work with Narmada Bachao Andolan and more recently has been a part of the political satire show Aisi Taisi Democracy with lyricist and writer Varun Grover and comedian Sanjay Rajoura. On what is happening with Aisi Taisi Democracy at the moment, Rahul says, “I have made a song out of Varun’s poem against the NRC and CAA, ‘Hum kagaz nahin dikhayenge’. There will be a video within a week, possibly with just placards and no faces because we don’t want to be responsible for people getting identified. Apart from that, our new season will start in March/April. As you can see, there is no dearth of material!”

It seems but a natural transition to ask if he thinks that celebrities or public figures should use their position and take a stand. “It is important [to speak out]. But look at what they have to lose. It is not fair frankly. I work for 30 years to be where I am and you expect me to stand up and give it all away. So, to each their own. If I know your heart is in the right place but you are not saying anything openly, maybe you will help in other ways.”

As for Indian Ocean’s future plans, he says, “We have a bunch of new material that we are going to release, probably starting next month. Not as an album though because no one wants to buy albums anymore. I think we will just let people download the songs for free much like what we did for our earlier album.”

Rahul adds that Indian Ocean, which has earlier worked on films such as Black Friday and Masaan, has composed songs for a few independent films.

He says, “A lot of younger film directors are open. They listen to independent music and import it into their films. I think the directors like the kind of music we do. But a lot of them like the Masaan songs which is different from what we do as well.” While agreeing that the music also depends on what kind of film it is, he laughs, “Black Friday had good music but we didn’t get anybody running after us saying ‘hey, we liked it’. So, we have never managed to hit the jackpot.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/byi8jk/article30556407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGMRAHULRAM1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/varun-grovers-poem-hum-kagaz-nahin-dikhayenge-will-be-set-to-music-rahul-ram/article30556408.ece
313,2020/01/13,Meet the Buchpatrovitch Trio who are in India for the second time,"“The Buchpatrovitch Trio is a project just for India,” say the members of the group, who are back in the country for the second time. Comprising French artistes — contemporary and tango dancer Gabrielle Weisbuch, gypsy jazz guitarist Vincent Patrin and classical guitarist and viola de gamba player Élie Ossipovitch — the trio (Buchpatrovitch being a portmanteau of their surnames) performed at Radisson Blu Atria in the city recently.

While they perform in other bands and Gabrielle and Élie perform together as do Vincent and Élie, their work as a trio is only available to Indian audiences.

On how it is to be back in India and what it is like to perform here, Élie, who has history with the country having lived here for three years, teaching and performing, says: “It is an interesting, mixed crowd. So, Bangalore was a big surprise but we have also played in places such as Palakkad and a college with 2,000 students, which was fun. In smaller places, they do not get much exposure to Western culture. So, as an artiste, it is nice to see people discover your art. It is a lot of emotion and something magical happens because they are discovering us and we are discovering India as well.”

15th Century instrument

After playing classical guitar for 10 years, Élie realised it was hard to “do something new because so many things have been done”. That is when the 15th Century instrument — the viola da gamba entered — the picture. “I wanted to play a cello and then discovered viola da gamba which is a mix between the cello and guitar. I wanted to do something which had not been done before. So, I took up this instrument which is not as famous and I play other kinds of music on it such as pop, jazz…many, many things. It is really interesting as a musician.”

On the other hand, Vincent, a former journalist, who has been playing gypsy jazz or jazz manouche for 10 years now, says there are many people all over the world playing this type of music (though he has not come across many in India), adding that he saw people playing gypsy jazz in Vietnam, and that it can also be heard in Woody Allen films.

Talking about the origins of gypsy jazz (the main instruments used being guitar, violin, double bass and clarinet), he says, “The godfather of gypsy jazz is Django Reinhard who created this style of music in 1930. The story is that he lost the use of two fingers during a fire in his caravan in 1928. He was a genius and so he adapted this technique to be able to play guitar again. At the same time, there was the influence of jazz from the US, music from eastern Europe and a French style called musette. So, that is a kind of music by mixing history.”

Élie adds that it is not intellectual jazz as it is based on traditional music prompting Vincent to agree, “No, no. It is not intellectual. A lot of people love this type of music because it is easy to listen to and understand.”

Dancer in the trio

As for the dancer in the trio, Gabrielle who has been dancing for 12 years after giving up gymnastics, says she will be performing contemporary because as the saying goes, ‘It takes two to tango’!

To the question of what stories she is tells through her dance and from where she takes inspiration, she says, “I improvise. So, when Élie and I perform together there is a story with a beginning, middle and end. But here, as part of the trio, I try to clear (my mind) before each dance to be able to respond and be fully present in the moment.”

On whether she plans to learn any traditional Indian dances, Bharatnatya lessons seem to top the list. “It is interesting for me to be able to understand the practices from the inside so I will learn something about dancing and life too.”

Élie adds, “I think one of the main ideas of coming to India and receiving from Indian culture and different bands/groups is that by mixing (our) differences, there can be richness and strength. You should share different languages and ways to see things and then you can be aware as to what can be done and be more tolerant. It is an idea that deserves to be defended.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/f13dff/article30556289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGMAPARNA5,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/meet-the-buchpatrovitch-trio-who-are-in-india-for-the-second-time/article30556291.ece
314,2020/01/13,When goals rained in for democracy against ‘fascism’,"There has never been a more valuable goal than the one scored for the democracy’s victory against fascism was the overriding theme at a unique anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest organised here at the Maharaja’s College ground on Monday.

The programme titled ‘An offering with football against fascism’ organised jointly by the Kochi-based Collective Phase One, Kozhikode-based Streets of Calicut, and Maharaja’s College union had football at the heart of it.

The major highlights of the programme were two events – Shootout for democracy and dribble past fascism – which needed the participants to score past a goal keeper and defenders of fascism symbolised by mannequins in white shirts and khakhi shorts. Every goal scored was accompanied by shouts of ‘Azadi.’

“The need of the hour is for the fraternity to stand together and embrace solidarity and harmony against fascism. Football has this ability to unify people and bring them together,” said writer-director Muhsin Parari, one of the brains behind the protest.

The programme organised in protest against CAA, National Register of Citizens, National Population Register and fascism got under way with blindfolded penalty kicks for democracy with the captains of national and State blind football teams Falhan C.S. and Aneesh M.K. and former national footballer T.V. Seena among the spot kick takers.

“We plan to score 10,000 goals against fascism in the shootout for democracy and absolutely anyone from any age group can come and take a kick and get on that score sheet in defence of democracy,” said Maneef M., co-founder of Streets of Calicut.

The programme featured a football tournament participated by four college teams. Besides, there were friendly seven-a-side and five-a-side games for which numerous clubs, including women’s teams, and football enthusiasts from across the State signed up.

“We had encouraged fans of European football clubs to participate to give a global reach to the message,” said Mr. Parari.

Liyons Jos, a hardcore Manchester United fan who turned up with his family, said that there was no better tool than football to propagate the message against hatred and bigotry.

Music was also a key part of the event with noted singer-composer Shabaz Aman and band Shanka Tribe performing even as placards and posters bearing slogans against CAA and fascism marked out the venue.

Initially, the plan was to organise a 24-hour-long programme but was later restricted to an eight-hour-long one till midnight.

“There is no other way but to keep up the civilian defence in the public sphere and embrace all possible mediums for knowledge production and creation of public opinion against fascism,” said Mr. Parari.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/when-goals-rained-in-for-democracy-against-fascism/article30560202.ece
315,2020/01/13,Heritage walk for students,"Muziris Projects Ltd is launching a heritage walk for school students to learn and understand the historical narratives of the erstwhile Muziris region.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac will inaugurate the non-formal history learning programme at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday at the Kottappuram Fort, one of the monuments part of the circuit.

“There is every need to pass on historical knowledge through a highly child-centred learning methodology, which itself makes the initiative unique. We aim to bring one lakh school students in 2020 as part of the drive,” says P.M. Nowshad, managing director of Muziris Projects Ltd. The students will have an opportunity to “walk through” the legendary landmarks of the port town of Muziris, including the Jewish synagogues, Kottappuram Fort, Paliam palace, Paliam nalukettu and the like.

Theme-based museum visits will also provide interactive learning aids such as bilingual activity books, games, and so on, he added.

316,2020/01/13,"As towers turn to dust, Maradu residents pick up the pieces","As the onlookers applauded the perfect implosions, the residents near Alfa Serene apartments in Maradu tried to hold back a tear when the huge structure came to naught on Saturday.

“These were, after all, dwellings of people,” said Sanuraj Nedumpilly, a driver who lives a few metres from site. “Agreed that these were illegal, and we also have learnt our lessons to be more vigilant. But, it was a very disheartening sight.”

This sentiment was shared by his neighbour, Suresh Nedumpilly, an employee at Infopark. In all this exercise, the role of the municipality and the State in reassuring people had been rather poor, he said.

Sarayu, staying alone, was afraid that her house would fall apart as the impact of the demolition processes that had started months earlier had created a wide gap on the front door frame and the wall. The floor of the kitchen seemed to have sunk a bit too, she said. This was the impact when the swimming pool of the flat was demolished. “So, it was not within our imagination what would happen when the entire structure came down,” she said.

Working with a catering unit, she has moved to her daughter’s place for the time-being. A lot of cleaning and repairs had to be done, she said.

“All the people here had lived in such fear that we have decided not to allow any more construction on the site,” said Suresh. It had been a harrowing time, said Sugunan, his neighbour.

Vishnupriya, Sugunan’s daughter, wondered whether the demolition would actually save the lake and the environment, since the whole exercise was to save nature.

Suresh’s son, Abhinav, a football player, and his friends expressed hope that the place would be turned into a playground. There was no place to play here, he said.

Most residents who were born there or had been staying there for over 35 years, remembered the mangroves and the paddy fields in the place where the flats stood. Ayesha, wife of Ibrahimkutty, said she used to cut grass for the goats she reared at that time.

Suresh remembers it as a place where he had spent his childhood swimming and jumping around the mangrove roots. A major change he felt in the morning on Sunday as he came out of the house was the extra sunlight on his premises, earlier blocked by the towering flat.

Many residents wondered whether the place would become a haven for anti-social elements. With 24-hour security in the flats and lighting, the residents too had felt a bit safer.

The residents are throwing up their hands in despair as the municipality has not been of any help in cleaning the place. Most of the people came back on Saturday itself, but had left the elderly and children at a safe place since cleaning would take a day or two. Ayesha said she had cleaned the house twice, but there was dust in the atmosphere that settled all over again.

“We have to get on with our lives and cannot wait till someone else comes to help us”, said Sanuraj. “The municipality should have given the people here a place to live for the next three months till the debris is removed, because dust is going to be part of our life till the place is cleared”, he said. Leaving his wife and small children at her parents, he and his parents had returned to clean up the place.

As in most cases with the government, the bureaucratic hurdles make everything unapproachable, said Suresh. The insurance offered had a process that would not be easy for people to pursue, he said. “First, we have to get the work done to rectify the cracks and give the bill to the municipality. The sum would be given by three entities – the municipality, the State Government and the company which was involved in demolition”. He wondered whether the amount would ever be realised at all.

Benny and Sindhu, who are among the neighbours of the demolished flat, with only a small pathway separating the their properties, had come back to look at their house after the implosion. They will be coming back later as they have taken up a rented house for three months.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/dodqiz/article30553124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-KI-AYESHAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/as-towers-turn-to-dust-maradu-residents-pick-up-the-pieces/article30553127.ece

318,2020/01/13,"‘It’s a mission well executed’ ,says Snehil Kumar Singh","On Sunday night, Snehil Kumar Singh, the Fort Kochi RDO, was a much relaxed man, speaking leisurely over his official telephone.

He did not rush through the conversation as he used to or messaged back enquiring whether he could call back.

“It was a job well executed, and I am happy about the way it was carried out,” said Mr. Singh when The Hindu caught up with him, hours after the successful demolition of the Maradu apartment complexes.

It was five months ago in September last year that he was appointed as the nodal officer for the unique assignment. There were precedents and models to follow, and he had to tread his path all alone.

“The task before the government was to implement the Supreme Court order, and I had to execute it. I was to follow the timeline fixed by the State Government for the purpose,” he recalled.

The formation of the technical committee and the selection of the demolition agencies were the two factors that influenced the outcome of the mission. The agencies never compromised on any aspects of their job. A support team with officials drawn from the nearby local bodies was put together, Mr. Singh noted.

The demarcation of the exclusion zone and the evacuation of residents from near the apartments were the challenges during the final days, he said.

The support of the district administration and the police also mattered, he said.

The Maradu municipal authorities were at loggerheads with Mr. Singh during his early days of the mission.

“It was some sort of miscommunication that led to the situation, and it took some time for them to understand the significance of the order and the gravity of the situation. The directive of the court had to be implemented in a time-bound manner. Eventually, the job was well executed,” said Mr. Kumar.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/its-a-mission-well-executed-says-snehil-kumar-singh/article30553069.ece
319,2020/01/13,"Deserted by officials, locals close to demolished flats can’t breathe easy","While the hubbub around the implosion itself dies down, residents in the vicinity of H2O Holy Faith are aggrieved at the dust that has engulfed the area and is likely to worsen when the rubble begins to be removed. They alleged that the authorities had done little to help them deal with the aftermath of the implosion.

“Every time a vehicle drives past or a gust of wind blows, the dust rises again. We cannot leave windows or doors open any more, or even step outside,” said Sicily Antony, whose house was within the 200-metre evacuation zone marked out for the demolition. The house, along with two others close to the flat, is still covered with plastic sheets to keep the dust out. Worried that the dust could exacerbate their breathing troubles, her little grandchildren would live away from the area for a few days.

A fire engine had hosed down the service road leading up to the apartment on Saturday evening, but that did little to keep the dust down, said Babu Joseph, who resorted to pouring buckets of water on the road himself on Sunday morning. “Now that the implosion is over, it looks like we are left to fend for ourselves. The municipality is not doing much to help,” he said.

Maradu Municipal Chairperson T.H. Nadeera said considering its limitations, the local body was doing as much as it could to help the residents. “We have arranged for water tankers to wet the road, but we are unsure of how long we can continue with that. When the debris is lifted from the area, the dust is only likely to increase,” she added.

When a heavy vehicle was stationed near the apartment site on Sunday, residents feared that rubble would be moved without any arrangements to deal with the dust, said Raju N.A., who lives in the neighbourhood. Irate residents met Ms. Nadeera on Sunday evening, demanding the municipality’s intervention, and they were assured that a fire engine would be sent. Apart from a portion of the metal sheet surrounding H2O Holy Faith falling backwards onto Dr. J.T. Pappanacherry’s compound wall right behind the building, none of the other buildings in the area suffered any damage.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/z5ia39/article30553050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12KI-CLEANING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/deserted-by-officials-locals-close-to-demolished-flats-cant-breathe-easy/article30553051.ece
320,2020/01/13,PCB to release findings on pollution levels within a week,"The demolition of Jain Coral Cove apartment complex was completed by 11.05 a.m. on Sunday, and emissions were observed as expected, said a Kerala State Pollution Control Board (PCB) report. Dust in cloud form was noticed in an area of 200-metre radius and a height of 50 metres.

However, the emission dispersed to normal within half-an-hour, said the report prepared by M.A. Baiju, Chief Environmental Engineer, PCB.

A study will be conducted in a week’s time to assess the approximate quantum of dust emitted from the demolition. The demolition of the building complex did not result in deposit of debris in the backwaters. Post-demolition monitoring of the backwaters was conducted, and the results will be published within a week.

The maximum sound level caused by the demolition of Jain Coral Cove complex was 115 dB.

The demolition of Golden Kayaloram apartment complex was completed by 2.30 p.m. A cloud of dust in brown colour was noticed in 100-metre radius and 50-metre height. Emission, however, dispersed to normal with in half-an-hour of the blast. The movement of wind was towards the east.

The PCB will now study the approximate quantum of dust emitted by the demolition. Preliminary observations revealed that there was more fine dust due to the demolition. No debris was found deposited in the backwaters. A study on the backwaters will be published within a week.

The maximum sound level observed during the demolition was 107.1 dB for Golden Kayaloram.

The board also said that common directions would be issued to parties engaged for the removal of debris of the two building complexes to ensure environmental protection. Regular inspection and monitoring will continue to ensure that there are no further pollution chances due to the demolition of the apartments, the report added.

The PCB has already constituted a team to monitor pollution caused by the demolition work and to coordinate pollution control activities.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/f6z04x/article30553004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-KI-JAIN-IMPLOSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pcb-to-release-findings-on-pollution-levels-within-a-week/article30553007.ece
321,2020/01/13,Maradu: Focus on debris amid call to green locations post-demolition,"While removing debris accumulated from the demolition of the four residential apartments in Maradu municipality over Saturday and Sunday has become a priority for the local body, environmentalists have given a firm call for greening the zone left vacant by the demolition.

Municipal Chairperson T.H. Nadeera said that after the last of the apartments was brought down on Sunday, the municipal authority would now work out a time schedule for removal of debris by contracting agencies. There is a roughly agreed upon target of between 45 and 70 days to get the grounds totally cleared even as the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) is set to issue a mandate on the methods to be adopted for safe removal and transport of debris from the demolition sites.

PCB Chairman Ajit Haridas said the Construction and Demolition Rules 2016 would be followed for debris removal and processing. Though the municipal authority is expected to establish the facility for processing demolition waste, it has not happened anywhere in the State so far.

The rubble processor will now be sourced by the company contracting the work, and it will arrive here next week. The equipment will be used to pulverise the remains and recycle them. Achyut Joseph, speaking for Prompt Enterprises, which has contracted the debris removal work, said the speed at which debris would be removed and recycled would depend on the time schedule provided by the municipal authority.

Debris will be transported in covered vehicles to yards identified at Chandiroor and near Kumbalam in accordance with PCB guidelines. Steel from debris will be removed on-site, and the rest, concrete and aggregates, will be recycled to manufacture usable products like paving tiles.

It is estimated that the apartment complexes have yielded around 4,250 truckloads of debris, each truckload weighing 10 to 12 tonnes.

In the meantime, there is a firm call for greening the sites where the apartment complexes stood. Former State Biodiversity Board Chairman V.S. Vijayan said the local body, in this case the Maradu Municipality, should be entrusted with the task of greening the land left vacant by the demolition. He added that it should be taken seriously and not abandoned. He suggested planting of fruit trees, the seeds of which could be disbursed by birds, for greening the areas.

However, Dr. Vijayan questioned the logic of demolishing the buildings which could have been put to public use. He said that evacuating the occupants resulted in evacuees constructing new houses for themselves. This will involve exploiting the Western Ghats once again for aggregates and building materials.

Activist Charles George, at the front of a charge to ensure that waterbodies are protected from the aggressive real estate lobby, felt that the land left vacant by the demolition should be taken over by the government and turned into green patches for future generations. He said that they could be mangrove forests and green areas.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/oitu8d/article30554700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-KI-KAYALORAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/focus-on-debris-amid-call-to-green-locations-post-demolition/article30552969.ece
322,2020/01/13,Maradu flats demolition: All quiet on demolition front; officials upbeat,"For the Maradu Municipality and its residents, it is a feeling difficult to describe.

Some fears were assuaged on Saturday after two residential apartment complexes were brought down without any hiccups. But two more crucial buildings remained to be razed. One of them, Golden Kayaloram, was located perilously close to an anganwadi, giving sleepless nights to Municipal Chairperson T.H. Nadeera and her colleagues, especially North Kundannoor councillor T.K. Devarajan.

“It is a quiet end to weeks of preparations,” he said on Sunday after Golden Kayaloram came down in a cloud of dust but without damaging the anganwadi and a massive residential complex under construction in the neighbouring compound. Mr. Devarajan recalled that he was also instrumental in bringing up environmental rule violations by the buildings that were brought down over two days.

Ajitha Kumari, councillor representing Ward 23 (Shantivanam), said she was happy with the way the demolition work progressed. Jain Coral Cove, located in Ward 23, was the largest of the apartment complexes, and real expertise was needed to bring it down accurately. At the end, it was brought down without even harming the compound wall in a major way, said Ms. Ajitha Kumari. She added that the demolition was so accurate that there was sufficient ground for a vehicle to move between the heap of rubble and the waterbody, which is just around six metres away from the foundation.

Ms. Nadeera was more than happy that the buildings were brought down with great technical finesse and without causing harm to humans as well as to structures in the neighbourhood. She lauded the engineers for carrying out the demolition so closely resembling the plans that were drawn up and revised several times before implementation.

Strong deterrent

Ms. Nadeera said the demolitions should be seen as a deterrent and a stern warning to violators of building and environmental rules.

The pulling down of the structures is a lesson for people, especially for construction projects in violation of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms. Those at the helm of the municipality in the 2005-2006 period and unscrupulous officials were primarily responsible for the apartments being torn down. Good many residents were unaware of the violations by builders, she contended.

“There are far too many apartments and other buildings which have cropped up across the length and breadth of Kerala with scant regard to norms. They pose grave threat to the environment since they have been built in wetlands, which are massive storehouses of water, or in agriculture lands. Their promoters hitherto thought that they could bend rules using money power.

323,2020/01/13,Akhshay Gandhi brings the rigours of research to theatre,"Akhshay Gandhi has not allowed success to come in the way of his craft. Undeterred by the limelight, he is constantly in quest of evolving a theatre practice. “I was a researcher interested in quantum mechanics, then I wanted to apply for my PhD in quantum computation. I agreed to take a job because they said it will add to the PhD, but the project did not work out. Around this time, I watched a Mashaal Theatre Productions’ Maut ke saye mein.The play was so gripping that I could not leave my seat. There were no sets or backdrop, but I could imagine the scenes. As a scientist this was huge for me. I was restless for an entire week. My manager, who I reported to, supported the arts and told me to take a break and explore art. My friend told me about Abhishek’s nine-month course. I attended it. That was when I decided this is what I want to do. I am able to know more about life through theatre, because that is what attracted me towards science.”

Art of science

Akhshay combines his artistic and scientific sides to evolve a theatre practice, which he insists is a work in progress. And so is Still Space Theatre which he started in 2018 and says is like a laboratory, in which he and his team constantly experiment and probe deeper into theatrical modules.

Akhshay makes no claims of being a self-made artiste. He is among the few artistes who first credits his trainers. “I can not thank my masters enough. They give you something that nobody else can.”

He has also trained with Eugenio Barba (Odin Teatret, Denmark), Anne Bogart & SITI Company, Veenapani Chawla and the Adishakti team, Sankar Venkateshwaran and H Tomba, and Ramakant Gundecha (Dhrupad, Bhopal). Akhshay says each trainer approaches theatre in a different way.

Later, Akhshay discovered Anne Bogart. “Abhishek had told me about her. I read her work and found it deep. So I wrote to Anne’s SITI company, which works on Suzuki method and viewpoints and attended their one-year course.”

The Suzuki method, Akhshay informs, was developed in Japan by Tadashi Suzuki. “He started investigating Kudiyattam, Kathakali, Noh, etc. He wondered what makes these classical forms so strong? He understood that they were still powerful even when stripped off aesthetics. So he created a training methodology deprived of aesthetics. He designed it in such a way that it would work for any kind of performance and came up with a system that looks at things classically yet has a modern relevance.”

Viewpoints were developed by Mary Overlie. “After studying multiple disciplines, Mary developed lenses, which are so personalised that you can work with any art form. Anne then took these and developed them for theatre. They are sensorial lenses...something you should be able to feel. The art is not technical, you should feel the sense of rhythm, timing, space... it is about developing sensibilities.”

Akhshay then decided to attend a residency by Eugenio Barba. “At their two month residency, I learnt new methods, and decided to apply them. Eugenio’s ideas are organic, narrative and evocative dramaturgy. He primarily works on dramaturgy. I connected with it.”

Mahesh Dattani’s Clearing the Rubble was a departure from Akhshay’s usual theatre work. “I normally don’t do scripted work. I am not a translator and don’t translate scripts to performance. But when I read Clearing the Rubble, which is a radio play, I found that it is beautiful poetry. It is written in three monologues. There is no stage instructions, which means I can be the author of the performance. As a theatre maker I was comfortable making this play, but through that process I realised this is the way I want to share my world with other people. Mahesh enjoyed the play, and that was rewarding for us.”

Burn my Diaries, another successful production directed by Akhshay, was a solo show written and performed by Shweta Desai. “It was based on the scientific idea of imagination and reality. Shweta wrote a character of a psychologist and how her work affects her. We started researching psychology. I was clear that I didn’t want to influence the audience. The play should not tell me what to do, instead it should change me. Burn My Diaries did that for me. The production was about mental health and illness, what we consider real and non-real, normal and abnormal. We didn’t have props. We wanted to make everything imaginary so that the audience could imagine everything from our childhood.”

Akhshay was, however, unsatisfied with In Place Of...“ We started creating the production with the question ‘Is art even relevant in conflict?’ Several discussions led us to realise that conflict involves violence, art and memory. All three are acts of expression. Then we decided to give it some kind of container which can look like a play. It was just an exploration. We don’t call it a script or narrative.”

From here to infinity

Faustus’s Dream, though, was a pleasant surprise for Akhshay. “The amount of content being generated was amazing. It was not supposed to be a ‘play’, it was supposed to be a showcase of the team’s artistic skills. After two days of devising, because of the shared language, we generated a lot of content. The performance is based on the premise that if humans have infinite time how will they pass it?”

Akhshay’s Kaavad Katha—Kaavad is a traditional Rajasthani storytelling form — is one of his most well-received performances. “I belong to small village in Rajasthan. I am often asked what I do, I say am a theatre practitioner. So they ask: ‘do you tell stories’, ‘ are you a traditional story teller?”. That got me thinking about Kaavad. So I went to Kaavadiya Khoja Ram ji. He told me no one knows much about Kaavadiya. He said Kaavad is puja, not art for us.”

Akhshay chose to immerse himself in the art form for three years. “I did a performance in 2015 in Ranga Shankara, but was not satisfied as it was theatrical and not traditional.” And so he polished it even further and toured with it. It was performed on January 11 at Atta Galatta.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/a23x8d/article30556402.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bgmAkhshayShowjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/science-of-performance/article30556404.ece
324,2020/01/13,Fashion label Urvii Mantreh’s collection is inspired by Bollywood period dramas,"As you enter Shimai Jayachandra’s studio in Besant Nagar, it is her tastefully decorated room that catches your attention. Seamlessly colour-coordinated with themes derived from China and Persia, it says a lot about the designer’s sense of aesthetic.

Her label Urvii Mantreh (Urvii is Sanskrit for Earth, Mantreh is Persian for divine rhythm) features handcrafted ensembles using rich Indian textiles, embellished with detailed embroidery. When she graduated from the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) in Chennai, it was Western wear that Shimai wanted to design. But once she had a chance encounter with textiles, she understood the aesthetic of rich Indian fabrics, and shifted her focus. Her range of thematic collections is now ready to be showcased in the city.

“I have 11 dedicated weavers working with me (seven in Varanasi and four in Andhra Pradesh). These weavers specialise in Benarasi and Uppada weaving, and we focus on traditional patterns such as ambi, shikargah and other motifs inspired by Mughal art and architecture,” says Shimai. Hand-dyed and embroidered organza saris are her signature.

Statement of elegance

Shimai is presenting three different themes in her upcoming show — The Jaipur Garden, Bollywood period drama and Taj Mahal.

Inspired by the Pink City, the Jaipur Garden collection features dupattas in vibrant colours, ombré dyed saris, as well as blouses and lehengas with hand-embroidered floral motifs. The collection inspired by the beauty and grandeur of Bollywood period dramas is a festive one; the outfits share a 1970s theme, and flaunt dramatic blouses paired with saris, lehengas, kurtas and dupattas in rich silks and gossamer organzas.

“An effort has been taken to preserve period flavour by adding antique brocades and embroideries. I have accentuated one aspect in each outfit. For example, the blouse of the sari or lehenga will have heavy work, making it aesthetically appealing,” she says. The third theme predominantly features whites, pinks and blues, and incorporates Mughal motifs inspired by the Taj Mahal. “I don’t use plastic or polyester [in the collections]. It is all pure silk. Even the pearls used in the embroidery are genuine,” she adds.

The Urvii Mantreh label focusses extensively on embroidery. “Understated elegance is my idea of design. The grandeur of Benares and the beautiful emotions of organza fascinate me,” she says. At the show, the designer will be showcasing saris, kurta sets, lehengas and dupattas. Some of her hand-embroidered blouses, and crop tops with exaggerated sleeves will also be on display. The price ranges from ₹5,000-₹85,000.

The exhibition and sale is open today and tomorrow at The Folly, Amethyst in Royapettah from 10.30 am to 7.30 pm",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/ik4mv/article30558184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MPUrviiMantreh001jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/in-line-with-tradition/article30558185.ece
325,2020/01/13,Inclusive education yet to be a reality in several schools,"Inclusive education is the motto these days. But school education in the State is hardly inclusive despite the best efforts by the Government and the Samagra Shiksha Kerala (SSK), according to parents of a few differently abled children who have been left out of the system.

Shahul Madavoor, State chairman of the Society for Rehabilitation of Differently Abled (SRDA), is the latest complainant. Earlier this month, he had alleged that his child, who was intellectually challenged, did not get the required attention at school, as the institution did not have the services of a resource teacher, a teacher trained in special education deployed at schools by the SSK.

Mr. Madavoor pointed out that his son was the only special needs student at the school. As the SSK has a policy of deploying teachers to only those schools that have at least five children with special needs, the services of the resource teacher were withdrawn from this particular school. “No other teacher cared if my child attended school or not,” he lamented.

It was only a few months ago that The Hindu reported a similar incident at West Hill in the city. Ironically, the parent in that case was reluctant to complain for fear of teachers at the school turning against her child. “Resource teachers are not supposed to teach special children but guide other teachers to help them. But the idea is yet to be ingrained in the brains of teachers here,” Mr. Madavoor said. The SSK, however, has blamed it on the scarcity of resource teachers. “We are facing a severe scarcity of teachers trained to attend to special children. Hence, we have been able to deploy only one teacher for two schools,” SSK district coordinator Abdul Hakeem said.

However, he complained that the other teachers were yet to accept that they were responsible for the special children too, despite repeated orientation sessions. “They often wash their hands of special children and are focused on teaching healthy children, while it is special children who really need their help,” Mr. Hakeem said, adding that it might take a few more years for the idea to sink in among teachers.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/inclusive-education-yet-to-be-a-reality-in-several-schools/article30561907.ece
326,2020/01/13,"Concern over outdoor washing, drying of patients’ cloths","Relatives and bystanders drying the cloths of patients and newborns on motorcycles parked on the premises of the Institute of Maternal and Child Health (IMCH) of Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, is a common sight these days. That these cloths are most often washed too at a nearby spot could turn out to be a source of infection, claim doctors.

A senior doctor at IMCH told The Hindu on Monday that patients from nearby places earlier used to wash their cloths from their homes. “Of late, everyone is seen doing it in the common washing area near the hospital building. Though the number of clotheslines has gone up so much recently, some people often dry cloths on top of vehicles, on windows, retaining walls, and even on staircases,” he said.

The practice could pose serious health risks as the cloths may have body fluids, and the infection may spread if they are washed at the same place, the senior doctor pointed out. “Suppose the cloths of a newborn are washed soon after the ones used by a patient infected with jaundice. It is such a risk,” he said.

Nipah outbreak

According to health experts, such practices often lead to hospital-acquired infection, a serious public health concern. One of the tragic examples was the Nipah outbreak in Kozhikode when some victims contracted the infection from hospitals. It is learnt that the State Government’s Clinical Establishment Act has provisions to address the issue.

The IMCH authorities had a plan to set up a laundry service, which reportedly did not make much headway. Even if restrictions are imposed on washing and drying of cloths, consistent pressure from relatives of patients is forcing doctors to relax them.

The senior doctor said patients from nearby places should wash, dry and iron their cloths from their homes. It will stop the possibility of infection to a large extent, he added.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/28cs24/article30561870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14-KI-CLOTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/concern-over-outdoor-washing-drying-of-patients-cloths/article30561871.ece
327,2020/01/13,A host of problems haunt KSRTC services,"Inflexible schedules, unexpected trip cancellations and the yet-to-be improved urban-village connectivity still haunt services by the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) and cut short the chance to increase its revenues in Kozhikode. Though the Kozhikode depot has 125 buses, including reserve ones, only 74 are now being operated with available staff.

The rural services earlier launched to connect the city with Thottilpalam, Kuttiyadi, Mukkom and Thiruvambady regions are yet to be successful with the odd timings selected for the operations. Though commuters to such rural areas prefer to have late evening trips from 8 p.m., as there are no private buses available, the authorities are yet to consider such a convenient schedule. Still now, the services to such distant locations start several hours late, which naturally discourages commuters from using the services.

“The inconsistency in operating some of the daily KSRTC schedules to villages too has created displeasure among commuters. We are not sure if a newly launched service will continue as such for sometime and people can really trust it,” says Sandeep, a resident of Thottilpalam. He points out that KSRTC can easily win passengers and overcome its financial crisis if it is ready to reschedule the loss-making trips in a scientific way.

KSRTC commuters in villages also point out that the practice of re-deploying buses in the Kozhikode depot to other districts for operating special services should be stopped as it would cripple the already ailing public transport system. They claim that the district is now short of 18 buses which were recently diverted for other special services without meeting the demand here.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/a-host-of-problems-haunt-ksrtc-services/article30553224.ece
328,2020/01/13,Private bus services on a slippery slope,"Vishnu, a 55-year old man from Kozhikode’s Vellannoor village, once owned five private buses on the Mavoor-Kozhikode route. Believe your ears, the ill-fated entrepreneur is now a salesperson at a local textile shop in Malappuram district.

Mr. Vishnu, who quit the sinking business nearly five years ago, is broken as he owes a huge sum to various banks. Even as the State government stands with an indifferent shrug, he is only one among several such unfortunate entreprenuers behind the wheel, claim other bus operators.

The number of private buses now in service is below 1,800 in Kozhikode district, and its impact is visible in the shrinking public transportation network. Nearly 100 buses temporarily keep off loss-making routes. A few other vehicle owners often resort to the trickery of suspending the scheduled trips to rural areas citing “mechanical issues” as it can save them the operational cost.

Bus operators say that around 600 private buses had stopped service in Kozhikode district in the past 15 years alone, which has mainly affected commuters in village areas. With the cancellation of several schedules, private bus journey after 8 p.m from Kozhikode city to interior areas like Thottilpalam, Kuttiyadi, Mukkom and Thiruvambadi routes is hardly possible. The high operational cost and limited revenue prevent many bus owners from resuming their services.

Hefty operational cost

Abdul Nazar, district president of the Kerala Bus Operators’ Association, says the owner of a 48-seat bus will have to remit ₹70,000 every year as vehicle insurance fee even if the service is incurring huge losses.

“The annual tax amount is ₹1.2 lakh. Apart from these expenses, the owner will have to meet welfare fund contribution, daily wages of workers, fuel charges and maintenance cost, which will never be proportionate to the falling daily returns these days,” he says.

The biggest crisis, according to bus operators, is the decline in the number of commuters with the increasing number of taxi services and private vehicles. Now, students are seemingly the biggest group still depending on private buses as they have concession ticket benefits. Bus operators say the ailing industry will not last long if the government does not hike the bus fare and concession ticket charges, apart from reducing the hefty tax and insurance amounts and offer fuel subsidy.

Poor collection

“Normally, the average daily collection of private buses in Kozhikode district never goes beyond ₹10,000. Of this, the owner will have to set apart at least ₹3,000 for wages and ₹5,000 for diesel. The rest is the meagre profit if there are no other emergency maintenance works,” says K. Radhakrishnan, district president of the Kerala Bus Operators’ Organisation. He says that a bus owner who spends about ₹32 lakh for the vehicle, hardly gets a reasonable return to pay back the loan.

Experienced drivers leaving for greener pastures in the West Asia and the lack of experience of those who replace them too have created headaches for many bus operators. Despite the increasing challenges, the owners stick on as many of them do not have any other self-employment options.

They also claim that the existing operators are small players in need of better support as their big counterparts have already left the field for good.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/frzmuu/article30553214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12KI-PRIVATEBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/private-bus-services-on-a-slippery-slope/article30553216.ece

336,2020/01/13,Delimitation of wards by Corporation inaccurate: Madurai Central MLA,"MADURAI

Madurai Central MLA P.T.R.P. Thiagarajan charged that the recent delimitation of wards by Madurai Corporation is erroneous and said that the exercise violated the principles under the law. He also alleged that the exercise is in favour of the ruling party.

While addressing the mediapersons on Monday, Mr. Thiagarajan said that in any ward the total number of voters cannot be higher than the total population of that constituency. “Out of the 100 wards of the Corporation, this issue is present in 24 wards after delimitation,” he said.

He also said that in multiple wards the boundaries of an assembly constituency has been altered, in violation of the Representation of the People and the Delimitation Act. “So, a voter who voted in a particular assembly constituency in the 2016 assembly election, should not be moved to another assembly constituency till the next assembly election. But this has been violated,” he said.

According to the law, the delimitation of wards should be executed in such a way that every ward must have more or less an equal population. In cases where it is not possible, a variation of 10% is allowed, he said. “However, this has not been followed in 61 out of the 100 wards after the delimitation by Madurai Corporation,” he charged.

Wards should be reserved for women candidates based on the population of women in that ward. But, in the recent delimitation activity, 34 wards that have been reserved for women do not comply with the above point, he said.

He also said that he has filed a petition on this issue which was pending before the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/delimitation-of-wards-by-corporation-inaccurate-madurai-central-mla/article30560640.ece
337,2020/01/13,Confusion over preparation for Class V board examination,"With students of class V all set to have board examinations in less than four months, a few schools in the district have started having special classes for students to prepare them to tackle the exam.

However, there is a lack of clarity on the conduct of examination and this process has further burdened the students, teachers say.

An amendment to the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009 called for a regular examination to be conducted for Class V and VIII at the end of every academic year. The State Government has, however, said that there would be no detention for the first three years.

Headmistress of Kakkai Padiniyar Corporation Primary School F. Helen says that special classes are being held every evening for students for the last two months. “Usually, classes get over at 4.10 p.m. After a five-minute break, special classes are held till 5 p.m.,” she says.

There is a lot of confusion among teachers on the examination pattern as the State government has not released any model question paper, says P. Rajendran, Headmaster of Corporation Primary School at Palanganatham.

“So, after the discussion on the type of questions that can be asked, the teachers have come up with a few model question papers,” he says.

The schools are now making the students memorise these model question papers, says Headmaster of Thirugnanam Primary School K. Saravanan.

“For instance, the Class V students are forced to memorise 150 questions on tenses to attend the English examination. Lessons on tenses are usually taught extensively only from Class 4. Then, how do you expect the student to excel within a year?” he asks.

There is also an increase in the number of Class V students who are attending private tuitions in the last two months, says Headmistress of Champak Nursery and Primary School C. Indira Pandiarajan.

“Lessons from all three terms have been included for the public examination. Since this is the first time the students will write an examination with more lessons, we also ask parents to give extra coaching,” she says.

The announcement of public examinations has burdened the 10-year-olds and has panicked them, says C. Karthiga, a parent. “My son has been anxious for the last two months and says that he does not want to attend school. He keeps focussing only on preparing for the examinations and has stopped taking part in other activities,” she says.

Concurring with her view, B. Vasanth Kumar, a parent, says that asking the students to write the examinations at different schools has further apprehended the student. “The students will be scared to ask questions to unfamiliar teachers at the examination centres,” he says.

But, on the positive side, the public examination will prepare students to tackle the competitive exams in the future, says District Chief Educational Officer R. Swaminathan.

“The students are tested based on the learning outcomes and this evaluation will improve the quality of teaching from the primary level,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/unimgm/article30560575.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA14CITY-STUDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/confusion-over-preparation-for-class-v-board-examination/article30560576.ece

339,2020/01/13,Registration of bulls for jallikattu,"A large turnout of youngsters and bulls from in and around Madurai and nearby district lined up at Avaniyapuram, Palamedu and Alanganallur for the registration of bulls on Monday.

With jallikattu to be conducted between January 15 and 17, officials from the animal husbandry department gave away tokens to bull owners after scrutinising the health of the bulls.

During the process, bull rearers at Alanganallur relented against officials over the distribution of tokens. The district police who were at the spot had to contain the swelling crowds as a strict cap of only 700 bulls were given tokens.

M. Rajasekaran from Alanganallur said that like him, several other youngsters were turned away by the district administration officials and the police as the tokens were distributed early in the day. “Although we have been standing in lines from 7 a.m., we could not make the cut,” he said.

Joint Director Animal Husbandry D. Suresh Christopher said that strict instructions had been provided to veterinarians to ensure that the bulls are at least 120 cm tall and are above 2.5 years in age.

“Only bulls with good health which are tough enough to face the crowd of tamers ideally should be allowed, particularly those which are trained. The Kangeyam and the Pulikulam varieties of bulls usually are pretty tall. Umbalacheri which were earlier bred in Thanjavur for the purpose of ploughing may not reach 120 cm but are one of the swiftest breeds. Discretion must be just to approve the bulls,” he said.

In order to tackle the yearly problems faced during jallikattu time in the holding yard, Collector T.G. Vinay had strictly stated that bulls can gather only at 6 a.m.

“Only those with proper certificates and tokens can stand in line unlike last year where bulls recommended by the organising committee were let in,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/qggkek/article30560333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ma14jallikattu2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/registration-of-bulls-for-jallikattu/article30560334.ece
340,2020/01/13,Country boat fishermen seek action against erring mechanised boats,"THOOTHUKUDI

Seeking action against mechanised boats that carry out fishing operations close the coast in violation of a ban, fishermen of four coastal hamlets in the district struck work and submitted a petition to Additional Collector (Revenue) Vishnu Chandran on Monday.

The petitioners from Manappad, Periyathazhai, Alanthalai and Amali Nagar said the mechanised boats from Thoothukudi Fishing Harbour, which had to go for deep sea fishing and had been banned to carry out fishing operations in coastal areas, were violating norms. Since the mechanised boats came close to the coast, they seriously damaged fishnets of country boats and even smaller craft.

Even after several complaints had been lodged with the police, 40 of the 260 mechanised boats operating from Thoothukudi Fishing Harbour continued to violate the norms, posing a serious threat to the livelihood of the country boat fishermen. Hence, the police and Fisheries department officials should be instructed to take serious action against them, they said.

Farmers, led by A. Varadharajan, president of ‘Karisal Bhoomi Vivasaayigal Sangam’, submitted a petition seeking removal of steel bars erected at the ‘U’ turn provided along the four-lane national highway at Melakaranthai. The farmers said the ‘U’ turn provided on the national highway had been used by them to take agriculture inputs to their farms in tractors.

341,2020/01/13,"Five, including husband, held for murder of woman","MADURAIMadurai City police have found that the two armed assailants, who were contracted to murder K. Lavanya of Bharati Ula Street here in her bedroom, were instructed to murder even her two minor daughters, by Lavanya’s husband Kumaraguru.

The police have arrested five persons, including Kumaraguru, and the two assailants. They were remanded in custody on Sunday.

“Kumaraguru, who was unable to manage business loss, got frustrated as his wife refused to pledge the properties in her name to raise loans. Hence, he employed assailants to murder his wife. He even asked them to finish off his two daughters and his mother, if they came in their way,” Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham said.

Kumaraguru, who was running a utensils shop, had already sold some of his properties. When he asked his wife to help him raise loans with the properties in her name, she refused, saying that their children might require them for their future.

“Then, Kumaraguru approached his worker Alex Pandian who introduced him to some people who, in turn, arranged the assailants,” the Commissioner said.

On December 24, when the family members had gone to a temple in Dindigul district, the contract killers attempted to murder Lavanya there. But, they could not accomplish their task and she sustained bleeding injuries.

“It was her husband who diverted Lavanya from the real motive of the assault, claiming that the attempt to murder her could be part of a bid to rob her and convinced her not to lodge a police complaint,” Tallakulam Inspector of Police A. Malaichamy said.

Mr. Davidson said the man behaved like a person with a serious psychological problem. An MBA graduate, he could not manage his father’s business. He had secured his bungalow with 16 CCTV cameras, which he switched off and allowed the assailants enter the house at around 3 a.m. by opening the front door.

The assailants went straight to the first floor where Lavanya was sleeping with her daughters. After assaulting them, they took away Lavanya’s mobile phone. When Kumaraguru’s mother tried to catch hold of one of the assailants, he inflicted cut injuries on her head.

The police said Selvakumar and Thangapandi organised the murder through hirelings, Senthil Kumar (20) and his brother Sathya Surya (19) from Melur.

The police were on the lookout for Thangapandi.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/five-including-husband-held-for-murder-of-woman-madurai/article30559657.ece

343,2020/01/13,Miyawaki forests take root and spread in Madurai,"A stroll at Walkers’ Park on the bank of Vandiyur Tank at K.K. Nagar would reveal a copse of different species and varying heights on a small patch of land. “There is a visible growth of trees in a short span of eight months. The guava tree, for instance, is now more than 10 feet tall,” says A.A.G. Rajkumar, president of Walker’s Club, which maintains the park.

The trees are raised in Miyawaki method, a technique of raising dense forests, named after Japanese botanist and plant ecologist Akira Miyawaki. In this method, plant growth is fast and foliage denser.

“With increasing deforestation due to urbanisation, Miyawaki method is ideal for urban spaces where a few cents of land can be set aside to grow dense forests,” says K. Sakthivel, founder of RainMan, a start-up that promotes Miyawaki method.

Similarly, Miyawaki forests raised at Madurai Corporation Commissioner’s residence, Special Needs Park on Alagarkoil Road and Corporation Zone 2 office have shown significant growth.

Successful examples and increased awareness of the concept have spurred an interest among people to raise trees in Miyawaki method.

Recently, around 1,000 saplings were raised by private organisations in Chellampatti. M.C. Saravanan, secretary of Vaa Nanba, a non-governmental organisation focussing on increasing Madurai’s green cover, says the organisation received around 150 phone calls from residents across the city in the last three months regarding growing Miyawaki forests.

The Corporation has planned to raise 100 saplings each at 25 sites, including parks, sewage treatment plants, micro-composting centres and ward offices.

Saplings are raised on plots of land dug up to six feet and filled with various layers of compost, biodegradable waste and red soil.

These dense forests improve groundwater level, says Mr. Saravanan. “Dense forests increase biodiversity. In three years, one can notice birds crowding these dense forests. In this natural process, soil fertility also improves,” he says.

Also, trees grow at a faster rate in Miyawaki method, he adds.

It is ideal to grow a combination of trees with varying heights and circumferences in this method, says Mr. Sakthivel. “It is advisable to grow trees using Miyawaki method at parks, open spaces in peri-urban areas, on the premises of industries and along the banks of channels,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/36159s/article30564310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA14MDUMIYAWAKI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/miyawaki-forests-take-root-and-spread-in-madurai/article30558882.ece

345,2020/01/13,It is sugarcane time,"With just three days to go for Pongal festival, Simmakkal area is witnessing chaotic activities.

Vendors are making bundles of 15 sugarcanes and selling them for ₹250, ₹300, ₹350 and ₹400, depending on the length of the cane. Although arrival of sugarcane is good due to better yield following copious rainfall, commission agents say profits are thin in the retail market.

B. J. Kamaraj, owner of Bose Sugarcane Shop on South Canal Bank Road, says household consumption of sugarcane has been steadily falling over the last couple of years, causing sugarcane to be used for purely for ornamental purpose. “Not many youngsters are tearing and eating sugarcane during Pongal. Although our intention is to sell bundles of 15, people tend to buy just two or three small pieces,” he says.

G. Muthukumar, the manager of the shop, says poor state of the economy is reflecting in the sale of sugarcane as well. “People have very less disposable income these days. So they are content with buying single canes for ₹50 to ₹70 to offer to the god. Earlier, sugarcane formed an integral part of Pongal festival and no house can be seen without so many canes,” he says.

S. Raja, a farmer from Chinna Mangulam, says sugarcane is mainly raised by farmers in Melur, Kallandiri, Keelavalavu and Chinna Mangulam in Madurai district. “Salem, Ettimangalam, and Nagapattinam are major producers in the State. Our farms have good crops which will not get spoilt with time. The rates though remain a problem. We sell our bundles for ₹ 150 and ₹200,” he says.

However, buyers like M. Ponnusamy says bundles of sugarcane will definitely be sold out before the end of the festival. “People have not forgotten their tradition and roots yet. The entire jallikattu protest in 2017 was about holding on to our tradition. Many people on social media platforms like Tik Tok take festival pride seriously. I am sure the agents will see good profits,” he says.

Besides sugarcane, people also buy turmeric. P. Jaya, a vendor, says it is sold for ₹30 a kg. “The sales will pick up closer to the festival date,” she says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ozb6gk/article30554836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MACITY-SUGARCANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/it-is-sugarcane-time/article30554837.ece
346,2020/01/13,Water hyacinth removed from Vandiyur tank,"A group of environmental activists along with officials from the Public Works Department (PWD) removed water hyacinth, an invasive aquatic weed, which thrived on Vandiyur tank, here on Sunday.

Led by PWD officials, volunteers from K.K. Nagar Walker’s Club, Gomathipuram- Thendral Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association, Dhan Foundation, and V.V. Kumar Memorial Youth Club, removed water hyacinths from about two acres of the waterspread area of the tank.

“The growth of water hyacinth across Vandiyur tank proves that raw sewage from households is still being discharged into the tank, as this aquatic plant usually thrives only on contaminated water,” said PWD Superintending Engineer (Periyar Vaigai Basin Circle) M. Sukumar.

The tank, which earlier had an ayacut area of 750 acres, has now shrunk to 150 acres, said PWD Assistant Engineer V. Santhakumar. “Now this tank is the major source for groundwater recharge for nearly 10 wards around the tank. But the wild growth of water hyacinths contaminates the groundwater and has also become a breeding ground for mosquitoes,” he said.

The president of Gomathipuram- Thendral Nagar Residents’ Welfare Association said that three years back, few volunteers had removed water hyacinths from the tank. “The growth of this aquatic plant is increasing rapidly and it is uncontrollable. Madurai Corporation officials must take steps to ensure that residents do not discharge raw sewage into the tank,” he rued.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/psbcw5/article30554823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MACITY-VANDIYUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/volunteers-remove-water-hyacinth-from-vandiyur-tank/article30554824.ece
347,2020/01/13,Youth urged to take music as a career,"Conferring Madhurakala Praveena title on Anitha Guha, artistic director of Bharatanjali, the Tamil Nadu Iyal Isai Nataka Mandram member-secretary V. Thangavelu appealed to the youngsters to take more interest in arts and music.

Speaking at the 68th Annual Music and Arts Festival organised at Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam here on Saturday, he said that many districts in Tamil Nadu had its own identity of their own arts and culture. However, Madurai stood apart as it had a long tradition of not only having sown the seeds for Tamil, but also for the art and culture. Lauding the House of TVS, which established the Samajam, Mr. Thangavelu said that organising music every year for the last 68 years showed the institution’s commitment to the arts and culture. The youngsters should make the best use of the infrastructure provided by the Samajam.

The Tamil Nadu Iyal Isai Nataka Mandram, which had been encouraging students and professionals with stipends in the field of arts and culture, had received 92 applications this year seeking assistance for learning nagaswaram, violin, flute and other instruments.

He appreciated the Samajam, which runs a music college - Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Vidyalayam, affiliated with the Madurai Kamaraj University, for encouraging students to take up research in the field of music. About 40 students were pursuing research, Mr. Thangavelu and wished more students followed suit. Like various other professions such as engineers, doctors, lawyers and chartered accountants, students could also shine as top musicians, he said appealed to the parents to encourage their wards to take up music.

348,2020/01/13,"This is the jallikattu wish list for bulls, tamers and spectators","On Sunday morning, a large number of workers were seen constructing spectator’s gallery in Palamedu, one of the three main venues in Madurai district where jallikattu, a popular bull taming sport held during Pongal, is set to take place.

Similarly, at Alanganallur and Avaniapuram, the other main venues, preparations have started for the conduct of jallikattu, involving the departments of police, animal husbandry, public works, revenue, district administration, and local organising committees.

Following the popular uprising against the ban on jallikattu in 2017 and the subsequent ruling of judiciary and the intervention of the legislature, there is more emphasis on providing sufficient infrastructure for bulls, players and spectators to make the event safe and largely incident-free.

The first and foremost area of focus is the collection points, where the bulls exit the arena. In the past, a large number of accidents had been reported in the collection points. A majority of these accidents involved spectators and those accompanying the bulls. Every year at least 150 bull owners would search for their bulls that exit the arenas, says C. Murugan, a bull owner from Alanganallur. “Sometimes, it takes up to three days for us to locate our bulls after the jallikattu. Hence, strengthening the collection points to solve these issues is important,” he says.

Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan says around 2,000 police personnel would be deployed at each of these venues during jallikattu. An eight-foot-tall double barricading would be installed in the arenas and collection points for the safety of people. “We have also taken measures to ensure that big wells and pits in the surroundings are sealed to prevent the bulls from falling into them,” he says.

An official from the district administration says the ground had been made into a slope beyond the collection point at Palamedu this year to prevent easy escape of the bulls. Two gates are proposed at the collection point to strengthen the security, says Regional Joint Director of Animal Husbandry D. Suresh Christopher. “This will prevent the possible re-entry of the bulls to the arena from the collection point. Also, the bull owners can easily identify and get hold of their animals,” he says.

To ensure additional safety, president of Jallikattu Padhugappu Peravai P. Rajasekar suggests that a few open cargo vehicles can be deployed at the collection points to transport the bulls to their owners. “This method, which is adopted at jallikattu events conducted in Erode, has been successful,” he says.

The other main area of concern is the holding yard, where the bulls, along with their owners, wait behind ‘vadivasal’ (entry point). “Due to fear that their bulls might lose a chance to participate in the event, the bull owners often tend to jump the queue behind vadivasal. Hence, a lot of accidents are reported here,” says S. Marichamy, a bull owner from Madakulam.

Though police are present at the holding yards, their strength has to be increased to avoid chaos, says S. Rajesh Kannan, a member of the organising committee at Alanganallur.

To address this issue, the number of tokens issued after the registration of bulls is restricted between 700 and 750 for each venue, says Collector T.G. Vinay. “This was a unanimous decision taken after consultation with various stakeholders. Now, the bull owners can bring their animals to the venues during the allotted time and this will avoid chaos at the holding yards,” he says.

While safety measures are in focus, it must be ensured that basic amenities such as drinking water, toilets and parking lots are provided for the thousands of people who watch and take part in the events.

It must be ensured that adequate number of drinking water cans are available near the holding yards and arenas, says M. Raja, a bull tamer.

The players also seek arrangements for having food stalls near government schools, where they usually wait. “A large number of bull tamers come from different districts and reach the schools as early as 2 a.m. and rest there. If there are stalls near the waiting areas, we can buy food,” he says.

P. Veluchamy, a bull owner, says authorities must ensure that adequate water and green fodder are available for the bulls at the collection points and holding yards. “There must be at least one tank of water for 50 bulls,” he says.

There must also be sufficient number of mobile toilets at accessible locations to ensure a hassle-free experience for the spectators, says P. Rukmani, a resident of Alanganallur.

The Collector says steps have been taken to ensure that all basic amenities are available during the events.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/88hgy4/article30554772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MACITY-PALAMEDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/this-is-the-wish-list-for-bulls-tamers-and-spectators/article30554773.ece

350,2020/01/13,Konkan Railway conducts trial run of electric loco between Thokur-Udupi,"Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. (KRCL) on Monday conducted a trial run of an electric loco on the Thokur-Udupi stretch that has electrified heralding a new era of energising locomotives from the conventional diesel locomotives.

Starting from Thokur, the electric locomotive was trailed by a diesel locomotive to face any emergency. Though KRCL’s Thokur-Bijur (105 km) section is completely electrified, the trial run was conducted only between Thokur near Mangaluru and Udupi, said an engineer of KRCL.

This was because KRCL is yet to get its power substations at Mulki, Barkur and Senapura energised by Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. For Monday’s trial run, KRCL drew power from Southern Railway grid that was 50 km away from Thokur and the maximum distance it could be utilised was 100 km. Hence, the run was confined till Udupi, the engineer said.

The trial commenced at Thokur at 4 p.m. and the locomotive reached Udupi at 6 p.m. by allowing all passing trains without any hitch. The diesel loco was attached as per the standard operating procedure. The return trial run was completed in an hour with the loco reaching Thokur successfully at around 8 p.m., the engineer said. Electrification work between Bijur and Kumta (75 km) too is fast progressing and is expected to be completed soon. Work to lay power traction till Bali in Goa under KRCL’s Karwar region is expected to be completed by November this year.

KRCL Managing Director Sanjay Gupta told The Hindu that with the electrification work completed between Thokur and Bijur, KRCL may get the statutory inspection done by the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) in about a month. Trial runs would continue and the CRS would be requested to conduct the inspection to certify the track worthy for electric locomotives to haul trains, he said.

Electrification work between Roha and Ratnagiri in Maharashtra too is on; but it is going on at a slower pace since patch doubling of the track is also on in that section, Mr. Gupta said.

Konkan Railway has been given the December 2020 deadline by the Ministry of Railways to complete the electrification of its entire 740-km network.

Southern Railway has already electrified its network till Jokatte where the Mumbai line of KRCL branches out.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ezi7ix/article30561834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MNELECTRICLOCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/konkan-railway-conducts-trial-run-of-electric-loco-between-thokur-udupi/article30561835.ece

352,2020/01/13,₹ 1 crore to be sought for Narayana Guru Chair,"Minister in-charge of Dakshina Kannada Kota Srinivasa Poojary said here on Sunday that the Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa will be requested to sanction ₹ 1 crore to complete the work on a building to house the Brahmasri Narayana Guru Study Chair on the Mangalagangotri campus of Mangalore University.

Addressing a gathering at a function after laying the foundation stone for constructing the building, the Minister hoped that MLAs, MLCs and MPs from Dakshina Kannada and Udupi too would contribute their share to complete the work on the building which required a minimum of ₹ 3.5 crore. At present, ₹ 50 lakh is available for taking up the construction work.

Mr. Poojary said that the values upheld by social reformer Narayana Guru were relevant to all the times.

B.K. Hariprasad, Member of Rajya Sabha, who released ₹ 50 lakh to the building work from his Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme Funds, said that Narayana Guru tried to reform society within the framework of Vaidika Dharma.

He propagated that there was only one caste and only one dharma and religion. Society remembered those who made sincere efforts to reform it (society) or serve people. Indian society with many religions, about 3,500 castes, 22 recognised languages and about 800 dialects is very complex. Notwithstanding it, secularism is the strength of the country, he said.

Mangaluru MLA U.T. Khader said that he would sanction ₹ 10 lakh to the chair. He suggested that the university bring all its study chairs under one building. If the country followed the preachings of Narayana Guru, it will emerge stronger, he said.

Vice-Chancellor of the university P.S. Yadapadithaya said that the building will be constructed in phases. To start with, the university will construct a part of the ground floor out of the ₹ 50 lakh available now. The remaining work will be taken up with further grant of funds.

The Vice-Chancellor said that the ground floor will have the reformer’s statue which will be placed in such a way that sunlight will fall on his face.

The ground floor will have a courtyard, a meditation hall, two meeting rooms, a library and an administrative office. On the first floor, the university proposed to have four classrooms, a museum, a library and two rooms for lecturers.

Swami Vikhyananda, seer of Shivagiri Mutt, Varkala, who spoke, said that Narayana Guru did not oppose Vaidika traditions.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/dbfz8d/article30555132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MNMANGALOREUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/1-crore-to-be-sought-for-narayana-guru-chair/article30555133.ece

“You feel cold and you are not able to get up to cover yourselves with a blanket. You want to raise your voice to seek help from others but you are unable to do it either,” Ms. Aital said and paused for a second.

“This was the condition I was in (at the age of 10) when I regained consciousness after a 21-day-long sleep (following an operation to rectify a birth defect and also for a medical accident). I smiled at my condition, made it look small and fought hard to overcome it. If you have the desire, nothing can stop you from achieving it,” she said, as the students clapped in appreciation.

Ms. Aithal, who has been teaching for the last 12 years at the college, was among the three young achievers featured in a panel discussion on “Believe in Yourself” organised by the Ramakrishna Mutt to mark the National Youth Day here on Sunday.

356,2020/01/13,Retail inflation at 5-year high of 7.3% in December,"Retail inflation soared to a five and a half year high of 7.35% in December 2019, with the shortage of onions driving the surge.

According to information released by the National Statistical Office on Monday, retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index was only 2.11% in December 2018 and 5.54% in November 2019.

The last time retail inflation was this high was the 7.39% recorded in July 2014, just after Prime Minister Narendra Modi began his first term in office.

The hike in inflation in the ‘vegetables’ category was at 60.5% last month in comparison to December 2018. Onion prices were above the Rs. 100 per kg mark in many major cities last month, due to a 26% fall in production.

Overall, food inflation rose to 14.12 per cent in December as against a negative rate of -2.65 per cent in the same month of the previous year. It was also significantly higher than the 10.01% recorded in November 2019. Along with vegetables, high prices of pulses, meat and fish also contributed to last month’s spike.

The Centre has mandated the Reserve Bank of India to keep inflation in the range of 2-6%. The RBI, which mainly factors in the CPI based inflation, is scheduled to announce its next bi-monthly monetary policy on February 6. In its December policy, the central bank, which had been reducing rates, had kept the repo rate unchanged citing inflationary concerns.

357,2020/01/13,Economic slowdown hits jobs sector: SBI report,"The economic slowdown has adversely impacted employment generation in the country as nearly 16 lakh less jobs are projected to be created in FY20 compared to 89.7 lakh fresh jobs in FY19, a report said.

According to the SBI research report- Ecowrap, there is a decline in remittances in a few states like Assam and Rajasthan, reflecting downsizing of contractual labourers.

“In FY19, India had created 89.7 lakh new payrolls as per the EPFO data. In FY20, as per current projected this number could be at least 15.8 lakh lower,” the report said.

The EPFO data primarily covers low paid jobs as the salary is capped at ₹15,000 per month. As per the calculation done by the report, during April-October 2019, the actual net new payroll was 43.1 lakh which annualised comes out to be 73.9 lakh for FY20.

The EPFO data does not cover government jobs, state government jobs and private jobs as such data have moved to National Pension Scheme (NPS), beginning 2004.

“Interestingly, even in the NPS category, state and central government are supposed to create close to 39,000 jobs less in FY20 as per current trends,” the report said.

It said a sample of data on remittances by migrant labourers to selected states in the last one year showed that there is a decline in remittances in states like Assam, Bihar, Rajasthan, Odisha and UP.

“The delay in resolution of cases under bankruptcy proceedings may have prompted companies to downsize their contractual labourers,” it said.

Over the years, migration has been an important livelihood option for both the poor and the non-poor in the country.

As a result of unequal growth, people from agriculturally and industrially less-developed states migrate to more developed states in search of job opportunities - for example from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, the southern part of Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Rajasthan to states like Punjab, Gujarat, and Maharashtra.

For a large number of migrants, New Delhi is a much-favoured destination due to the abundance of job opportunities, the report said.

“These migrants have been making significant financial contributions to their families in their places of origin,” it said.

The report further said in the last five years, the overall productivity growth has remained relatively stagnant between 9.4% to 9.9%.

This slow growth in productivity manifests in low wage growth, it said.

The report also cautioned the policymakers of such slower productivity growth as it could encourage over-borrowing by corporations and households, which can create a big risk to economies and fiscal systems.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/htuzgf/article30556925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jobs,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/economic-slowdown-hits-jobs-sector-sbi-report/article30557012.ece
358,2020/01/13,"More time for firms to split MD, CEO posts","Top listed firms such as Reliance Industries, HUL, ITC, JSW Steel, Hero Motocorp, TVS Motor and Raymond, along with a long list of other private and government-owned entities, have got two more years to split the position of chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD).

As part of the latest amendment to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, the capital markets regulator postponed the deadline for the separation of the MD and CEO roles for the top 500 companies from the earlier stipulated April 1, 2020 to April 1, 2022. This assumes significance as some of the biggest names of India Inc. had sought a relief in terms of postponing the deadline to comply with the norm notified in May 2018.

Sufficient time given

Less than two months ago, SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi had said firms had been given sufficient time, and seeking extension of the deadline would only mean that companies do not want to comply.

“Sufficient time has been given and extending it will only mean that they don’t want to do it. Leader of the board (chairman) and that of management (CEO), if they are two different persons then, perhaps, there can be balance in powers and responsibilities, and decision making,” Mr. Tyagi had said on November 20 while addressing the media post a board meeting.

As many as 160 of the top 500 listed entities are yet to split the MD and the CEO posts, according to data from Prime Database. The list includes most public sector undertakings, private sector entities such as Adani Ports & Special Economic Zone, HCL Technologies, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, MRF, Bharat Forge, Edelweiss Financial Services, PVR and Escorts, among others.

“Industry had various concerns in implementation, including seeking a clear regulatory demarcation on the role and responsibility under the Companies Act, 2013 and SEBI’s Listing Regulations for chairman and managing director,” said Sumit Agrawal, founder, Regstreet Law Advisors.

“Certain boards had also asked for bright-line tests for segregation of overlapping roles. For instance, section 27 of SEBI Act, 1992 casts no liability on chairman but MD continues to be responsible for the acts of the company or its board of directors,” the former SEBI officer added.

The SEBI notification stated that with effect from April 1, 2022, the chairperson of any of the top 500 listed entities would be a non-executive director and not be related to the MD or CEO as per the definition of the term “relative” defined under the Companies Act, 2013.

“Companies that have implemented the change in board structure without waiting for last date, might feel [let down] with this postponement. Tendency to postpone compliance due to a change in law has developed a habit amongst stakeholders to wait till the last date and see if there is any postponement,” said Makarand Joshi, partner, MMJC and Associates LLP, a corporate compliance firm.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/n8lwzr/article30561336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14SEBIbw,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/more-time-for-firms-to-split-md-ceo-posts/article30561338.ece
359,2020/01/13,Trade deal’s first phase will include purchase of $200 billion American products by China: U.S.,"China’s purchase of USD 200 billion worth of additional American products over a period of two years is part of the “Phase One” trade deal with Beijing, the U.S. said, as the world’s two top economic powers look forward to ending their bitter two-year tariff war this week.

President Donald Trump announced last week that the U.S. will sign the first phase of a pending trade deal with China “probably” on January 15. “We’re signing, as you know, a very big deal among many other things with China...probably on January 15,” Mr. Trump told reporters at a White House event.

China’s commerce ministry on Thursday last confirmed that Vice-Premier Liu will be in the U.S. capital from Monday to Wednesday to sign the “Phase One” trade deal with the U.S. The deal signals a de-escalation in a trade war that has lasted between the two economic giants for nearly two years.

The deal includes the China’s purchase of $200-billion worth of additional American products, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday.

In an interview to ABC News, he said, “It is $200 billion of additional products across the board over the next two years and specifically $40 billion to $50 billion in agriculture.”

“This is a big opportunity for our farmers. I think some people have questioned whether they can produce it. However, the President said they are going to go out and buy more land and produce plenty of [products],” he said. Describing it as a “historic transaction”, Mr. Mnuchin said further talks would be held for the remaining phases.

“As we have said, there will be a Phase Two. But this is the first time we have had a comprehensive agreement with China on technology issues, agricultural issues, financial services, purchases and a real enforcement mechanism. So this is a big win for the President,” he said.

Enforcement provisions

Mr. Mnuchin said the first phase of the trade deal includes real enforcement provisions. “If they don’t comply with the agreement, the president retains the authority to put on tariffs, both existing and additional,” he said. The language of the trade deal, he said, will be released this week.

“The day of the signing, we will be releasing the English version,” he added. According to Mr. Mnuchin, there are very important intellectual property rules in the deal that the U.S. expects the Chinese to adhere to. “There are cyber concerns that we do have. So, let me just be clear. Cyber will be part of Phase Two,” the Secratary said.

“But we have incorporated provisions in Phase One that we think are important protections for U.S. companies. So, we have made very clear there can be no forced technology transfer and that China is putting out laws to protect both U.S. technology and other technology,” he added.

Mr. Trump, who has been accusing China of indulging in unfair trade practices, contributing to the huge trade deficit amounting to $375 billion, had earlier warned that if a deal is not reached by March 1, the end of the 90-day grace period, the U.S. will increase the tariffs on the $200 billions of goods from 10% to 25%.

IPR issues with China

The U.S. President has been demanding China to drastically reduce the trade deficit and ensure Intellectual property rights production for U.S. technologies and services. The escalating trade war raised concerns in China as its economy was on the downward trend amid efforts by the government to rejig the export-dependent economy to that of relying more on domestic consumption.

Last year, the U.S. imposed tariff hikes of up to 25% on $250 billion of Chinese goods. The move prompted China to increase tariffs on USD 110 billion of U.S. goods.

China is currently America’s largest goods trading partner with $635.4 billion in total (two way) goods trade during 2017. Goods exports totalled $129.9 billion; goods import totalled $505.5 billion. The U.S. goods trade deficit with China was a whopping $375.6 billion in 2017.

Trade in services with China (exports and imports) totalled an estimated $75 billion in 2017. Services exports were $57.6 billion; services imports were $17.4 billion.

365,2020/01/13,Lessons from Maradu,"When there is weak enforcement of environmental laws, corruption, and undue political influences, violations become common. Such violations have been questioned, and strict action taken by the authorities concerned, on very few occasions. The four high-rise luxury apartment complexes in Maradu municipality in Kochi, which violated Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notifications, were demolished on January 11 and 12 following a Supreme Court order. This incident points to the need for a paradigm shift in our environmental consciousness.

Supreme Court order

The apex court stated that these apartments had been built on the shores of Vembanad wetland, renowned for its rich biodiversity. The wetland is a part of the strictly restricted zone for construction under the provisions of the CRZ notifications, which aim to protect the ecology of the coast. Hence, the violations cannot be lightly condoned. The illegal constructions in Maradu might have hindered the natural water flow of Vembanad and resulted in severe natural calamities such as floods, which Kerala witnessed in 2018. Following the court order, residents, about 350 families, started to protest. Despite this, the court gave strict instructions to the State government to speed-up the demolition process.

After the court order, a house owner said, “We are innocent buyers who are frightened about losing our homes for no fault of ours”. The rising demand for waterfront apartments has encouraged many builders to violate norms and construct apartments on the banks of rivers and lakes. It is quite difficult to believe that builders and buyers — the upper class community in Kerala — were unaware of the legal norms they are supposed to obey.

The crime branch found that the builders had constructed the apartments after conspiring with panchayat officials in 2006. This indicates the gravity of institutional and policy failures. According to the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority, constructions had taken place in critically vulnerable coastal areas which are notified as CRZ-III, where no construction should be permitted except repairs of authorised structures.

Builders and local body officials who supported the illegal constructions have been arrested. Builders’ bank accounts have been frozen and their properties confiscated. The court ordered that a compensation amount of ₹25 lakh be paid to to each household. The demolition costs should be paid by the builders to the government.

Cost of violations

The overall cost of violation is immeasurable. The house owners who lost their flats not only suffered financial losses but were also under mental pressure. There were major administrative challenges in demolishing the apartments. Expert consultations had to take place, the public needed to be made aware of what was happening and a safe demolition strategy had to be drawn up. Families in the neighbourhood were anxious about their life and property. The safety of public assets such as roads and bridges was also a concern. Besides, there were environmental costs of the demolition including air and noise pollution, contamination of the lake, and safe disposal of the debris.

If an industry discharges effluents, the enforcement agency can fine or tax them (polluter pays principle) and/or insist that they install pollution control measures or follow safe waste disposal strategies. But if someone violates the law and constructs apartments in an ecologically sensitive zone, the removal of these buildings is the only solution; no heavy fine will fulfil the purpose of complying with the law.

The apex court order to demolish the Kapico Resorts, also located on the banks of the Vembanad Lake in Alappuzha, is another landmark judgment. We don’t know what will happen to other illegal constructions in India. But there is no doubt that the Maradu incident will help builders guard against future violations.

366,2020/01/13,Favouring public order over justice,"Last week, the Supreme Court gave its much-awaited judgment on the legality of the telecommunications and Internet shutdown orders in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), in place for more than 160 days now. Given the centrality of the Internet in our lives and the fact that the preceding weeks had seen such shutdowns in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi, the ruling was eagerly awaited across the country. However, in its language, structure and the relief granted, the verdict came across more as one premised on legal centrism than one advancing fundamental rights.

After acknowledging in the first paragraph that India is a “land of inherent contradictions”, the court immediately assumed the role of an acrobat which had to “strike a balance between the liberty and security concerns” rather than rule in favour of citizens’ rights. That said, it is important to understand that the scope of the constitutional challenge before the court was narrow by design. The petitioners, with considered and strategic thought, did not challenge the underlying power of the Central government to turn off telecommunications and Internet connectivity. The focus of their challenge was not the Telegraph Act and the Internet Suspension Rules that enabled the government to shut down the Internet, but squarely on the orders passed under these laws.

Reluctance to furnish orders

In this regard, the petitioners faced a challenge that is common in present times. The government had not made the shutdown orders publicly available. Pressed for disclosure, the Centre initially cited national security concerns and, only after persistent arguments over multiple hearings, filed some sample orders. To not even provide the Supreme Court a copy of such orders was an extreme position, but did not come entirely as a surprise. We have in the recent past seen such opacity, especially under former Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, clothed in what legal scholar Gautam Bhatia termed “sealed cover jurisprudence”. Ultimately, it came as a relief that, to some extent, ordinary legality and common sense prevailed. The apex court rejected the government’s secrecy claims and directed the publication of orders recognising that, without them, litigants would not be able to seek judicial remedy. However, eventually, it failed to judicially review the orders furnished in court and also permitted claims of privilege to prevent their disclosure.

Question of fundamental rights

The principal job of the court in such writ challenges is to review the administrative and executive action. In this case, the decision charted the link between fundamental rights and access to the Internet and sought to apply it when it came to prohibition in place in J&K. While doing so, the court rejected the government’s arguments emerging from extreme positions of national security. It applied the proportionality doctrine to reason that “complete blocking/prohibition perpetually cannot be accepted”. And while noting the issues pertaining to the Internet shutdown rules, the order directed the government to change them and placed a time limit of seven working days for periodic review.

These victories were incremental and certainly could not be termed as ‘wins’. They emerged amidst a cynical framing of rules by the executive and extreme, adversarial national security arguments to impair progressive constitutionalism. The judicial response followed clear precedents and did not fashion anything novel. For instance, on the surface, the directions for the right to access the Internet may seem to be a victory for the litigants. However, this was already a well-established position flowing from various previous verdicts such as the Section 66A decision in the Shreya Singhal case and administrative policies and orders such as National Telecom Policy and Net Neutrality Rules.

Even when it comes to the court’s direction to conduct a periodic review of such shutdowns every seven days, it needs to be noted that the review committee will lack independence and real power to overturn the initial Internet shutdown orders. The committee will be principally composed of bureaucrats and no independent members. Further, the findings and recommendations of such committees, as scholar Nakul Nayak has shown, will not be legally binding. As Mr. Nayak has noted, those wanting to be heard by the review committee will face several procedural obstacles. Ultimately, the judgment has left it to the government to decide on such shutdown orders under pre-existing constitutional principles.

The Supreme Court applied a limited rights doctrine and removed the anxiety among a section of the Indian public concerning drastic constitutional regression. Such mixed results can be understood by looking beyond the court to our present political environment. The verdict has come at a time when basic rights are being violated with impunity and public expectations for remedy from institutions are extremely low. And though the court may have rejected several contentions by the government, ultimately it seems to have accommodated the arguments of the executive branch on issues of national security.

An act of judicial centrism

The ruling may be termed as an act of judicial centrism. The court clutched on to the basic constitutional norms to maintain legality, while showing reluctance to expand upon rights. An end product of such a posture is that it may not extend the true spirit of our fundamental rights and would perpetuate a status quo. This was tangibly felt when the judgment shifted the legal review of the J&K shutdown orders — the principal question of determination — back to the government.

The court further avoided any comment on the legality of such orders given in the past, even those furnished by the government before it. Martin Luther King admonished this kind of centrism when he said that it was “more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; [that] prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice”.

On the whole, the judgment was a statist expression of the law, neither conservative nor radical. For actual relief, petitioners will now need to approach the high courts, which will come at a huge cost to their time and the right to access the Internet. The legal doctrines laid down in this ruling may be beneficial; however, the more difficult task will be to obtain clear-headed pronouncements that actually declare the executive orders, such as those that led to the shutdown of Internet in J&K, to be illegal.

Today, “We the people” is not a mere phrase of our constitutional preamble but a call for action to Indians. They must encourage our institutions to shift from centrism to a progressive assertion of our fundamental rights.

367,2020/01/13,Matter of interpretation: On NCRB’s Crime in India Report 2018,"Only three months after the release of the much delayed “Crime in India report” for 2017, the National Crime Records Bureau’s 2018 report was unveiled last week. While the fact that this document has been made available so soon should be welcomed, this report, as with those for earlier years, carries the caveat that crime records and statistics are only as good as their reporting. Some States are better than others in tracking and registering crimes. This is why Kerala and the National Capital Region having the highest crime rates in the country — 1463.2 per one lakh population and 1342.5, respectively — is also a reflection of the fact that crime reporting, follow-up and subsequent steps in trial and punishment are much better undertaken in these two States/UTs. Yet, what should be worrying for the capital city region is that unlike Kerala, the number of cognisable crimes has steadily increased to 2,62,612 in 2018 from 2,16,920 in 2016. Better reporting could also perhaps explain why there is a 15% increase in the total crimes against women across all States, but the fact that this number went up by 66% in a large State such as Uttar Pradesh must be cause for concern. Conversely, crimes against women fell 20.8% after reaching a peak number of 17,222 in Delhi. It is well understood that the protests against the gangrape in Delhi in 2012 had significantly contributed to greater reporting of crimes against women. The fall in these numbers, corresponding to the general increase in crimes, could reflect the outcomes of better gender sensitisation in the capital region. Unlike crime numbers that are difficult to interpret due to registration and policing issues, the number of murders across States is a stark reflection of violent crime. The finding in the 2017 NCRB report that northeastern States such as Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya have a relatively higher murder rate compared to most States bears itself out in 2018 as well. Other States which have a worrisome record here include Jharkhand (4.6 murders per one lakh population, the highest in the country) and Haryana (3.9). Among cities, Patna (4.4) has an egregious murder rate.

While protests and violence related to them have occupied the news cycle in the last month or so, data from the report suggest that there has been a marginal decrease in the total cases related to rioting from 2016 (61,974) to 2018 (57,828). Cases related to caste and communal/religious riots, political violence and agrarian conflicts registered a dip while there was an increase in industrial rioting and other personal disputes. Among cases registered as “offences against the State”, there has been an ominous increase under “sedition” with the number of those booked in 2018 double that of 2016, even as most such cases under this section came under the “Prevention of Damage of Public Property Act”; Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh led with nearly half of the overall cases.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/matter-of-interpretation/article30551693.ece
368,2020/01/13,Man-made disaster: On Iran shooting down Ukraine plane,"The shooting down of a passenger plane by Iran’s military on Wednesday, a few hours after it launched missile attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq, is the most tragic outcome of the recent spike in U.S.-Iran tensions. The Ukrainian jet with 176 aboard was hit by an Iranian surface-to-air missile shortly after it took off from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport. After initially rejecting western assertion that an Iranian missile brought down the plane, Tehran on Saturday said one of its soldiers fired the missile, mistaking the jet for an enemy aircraft “as it turned to a sensitive area”. This is not the first time U.S.-Iran tensions have led to an aviation disaster. In 1988, in the last stage of the Iran-Iraq war, a U.S. Navy warship shot down an Iran Air flight over the Gulf, killing all 290 passengers. Then the U.S. troops said they mistook the plane for a military aircraft that was going to attack the ship. Iran says the same today. In both incidents, innocents, who did not have anything to do with the conflict, became victims.

This time it was U.S. President Donald Trump’s reckless decision to assassinate Soleimani that pushed both countries to the brink of a war. After launching missiles at U.S. troops in Iraq in retaliation for the General’s killing, Iran’s missile defence systems were on high alert, anticipating retaliatory American air strikes. Iran blames “human error” for the attack on the passenger plane. But whatever the context is, it cannot abdicate responsibility for what happened. Ukraine International Airlines says the flight took off after clearance from the airport. The airline also rejects the Iranian military’s claim that the plane veered off its route. Iran’s admission and apology is a step in the right direction. But it should carry out, along with international investigators, a thorough probe into what led to the “accident”, and punish whoever is responsible for the “human error”. Such mistakes are unacceptable even in war. Iran should have put in place the highest safety measures and followed international protocols while preparing itself for enemy retaliation. Clearly it did not do so. And innocent people paid a price for Iran’s mistake. Both Iran and the U.S. should also ask themselves whether the confrontational path they have chosen since Mr. Trump unilaterally pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal, in May 2018, was worth the risk. Both countries were on the brink of an all-out war early this week. At least 226 people, mostly Iranians, have already lost their lives in tragedies related to the Soleimani killing (over 50 were killed in a stampede at the funeral). If Iran is sincere in its apology, it should not only unearth what happened and punish the culprits but also take immediate steps to reduce tensions with the U.S.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/man-made-disaster/article30551692.ece
369,2020/01/13,600 Bengaluru police personnel in drum jam,"On Sunday morning, visitors at Orion Mall were surprised to see 600 policemen and women in uniform jamming with percussion instruments ranging from bongo drums to tambourines, under the guidance of actor and singer Vasundhara Das.

Personnel were given time off from duty to participate in this stress-buster session, which also included a screening of the Ajay Devgn starrer Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior.

“It was a team-building exercise for police personnel and staff members organised by N. Shashikumar , DCP, (North Division), under the guidance of Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao. Away with busy schedule and immense work pressure, police officers across ranks took part,” said a senior police official.

The day began at 7 a.m. with the special screening of Tanhaji.

“Staff were given a choice of four films, and it was unanimously decided that they would watch Tanhaji, as it has a patriotic message,” Mr. Shashikumar said.

Later in the day, they assembled for the drum jam session. During the session, personnel were seated in a concentric circle, with each playing the drums or a percussion instrument.

A senior police officer recalled providing security cover to such events in his career. “I used to watch them on duty, and wonder what they were experiencing. Now I know, and I feel young again,” he said.

The team-building exercise received a positive response from participants.

“It was the best experience we had,” said Malleshwaram Inspector Chandrakanth. “Initially, when were told about this outing, we were a little apprehensive, but everyone had fun and bonded with each other.”

Other police personnel said it made a pleasant change from their routine.

“We normally work under stressful or high pressure conditions every day. This is totally a different experience, which we will cherish,” another officer said.

370,2020/01/13,10 new roads on outskirts to ease congestion in Bengaluru,"With the aim of decongesting Bengaluru, which is choking with vehicular traffic, the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) is developing a network of roads on the outskirts that connect directly to national highways. Once completed, they will negate the need for motorists to enter the city.

After taking up a project to develop roads on the outskirts leading to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA), the KRDCL has now floated a tender for a detailed feasibility report to develop 10 additional roads — with a total distance of 148 km — around Bengaluru.

The longest stretch (43 km) is the one from Bidadi on Mysuru-Bengaluru highway to Nelamangala Chandrappa Circle, Tavarekere and Sondekoppa. This network, said officials, will decongest NICE Road and provide alternative options for motorists travelling from Bidadi to Nelamangala.

In addition, there are plans to develop a 16-km stretch from NICE Road junction to Whitefield via Sarjapur Road. This will help people working in the IT corridor.

The estimated cost for the 10 roads is around ₹1,200 crore though the final figure will depend on the detailed feasibility report.

KRDCL Managing Director B.S. Shivakumar told The Hindu that the proposed roads will have four lanes. “As of now, beyond NICE Road, there is no good infrastructure that connects Mysuru Road with Magadi Road and Tumakuru Road. We want to build a network from Bidadi to Nelamangala. In addition to this, for the benefit of those who are using NICE Road to reach KIA, we are proposing a road network from Makali to Kakolu. This will help passengers to reach KIA faster. Providing an alternative road from NICE Road to the airport will help decongest the existing traffic at Goraguntepalya, Hebbal and other junctions,” the official said.

Toll collection on the cards

The network is being developed under Phase II project beyond NICE Road and the proposed Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) project. When asked about whether KRDCL will be building toll roads from Bidadi to Nelamangala, Mr. Shivakumar said, “As per our plan, it is a toll road. However, the State government will take a final decision.”

Under Phase I, the KRDCL has taken up construction of roads in the eastern and northern outskirts of Bengaluru. These include Hoskote-Budigere Cross-KIA via Budigere-Singahalli and Mylanahalli. The 20-km road is estimated to cost ₹254 crore, and it will will benefit motorists coming from Electronics City, Whitefield, Sarjapurand Hoskote.

Other roads to be developed in Phase I are the stretch from Nelamangala to Madhure, and Madhure to Devanahalli Road via Rajanukunte and Thimmasandra. The 39.24-km road is estimated to cost ₹548 crore.

KRDCL had proposed that toll be collected on these roads.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pqojmy/article30561777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BgNew-Road-Mapcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/10-new-roads-on-outskirts-to-ease-congestion-in-city/article30561778.ece
371,2020/01/13,Co-operative bank meeting postponed,"Tension prevailed at the Gurunarasimha Kalyanamantapa where hundreds of anxious customers of Sri Gururaghavendra Sahakara Bank Niyamita had gathered for a scheduled meeting called by the bank. After hundreds of the bank’s customers waited for over two hours, the bank president appeared before them only to state that the meeting had been postponed to January 19.

Since the Reserve Bank of India’s clampdown on the bank, several citizens have been gathering at the bank, seeking clarity from the management.

The RBI notice, a copy of which is available with The Hindu, says that the urban cooperative bank has been effectively barred from any operation — granting new loans, making investments or accepting new deposits — except for allowing withdrawal of a maximum of ₹35,000 of the total balance in any account. While it clarifies that this does not mean cancellation of banking licence, it said restrictions will continue “till its financial position improves”.

K. Ramakrishna, bank president, said, “We have to follow the RBI guidelines and customers can withdraw ₹35,000 from the balance of any account for the next six months. If the RBI revokes the curb on our bank, we are ready to give the money back to the customers. We have requested RBI officials to attend the meeting with the bank’s directors to answer queries of customers.""

When the customers demanded answers, he said: “I am as helpless as the customers are right now. Let's organise a rally to the RBI office and get some clarity.”

Earlier in the day, hundreds of customers stood in a queue outside the bank in Basavanagudi to collect coupons to withdraw money from the ATM.

It is said that one of the customers called Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya and put him on speaker-phone for the benefit of others. He reportedly tried to assuage frayed nerves of the customers by promising to raise the issue with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/vob6m0/article30561488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGBANKQUEUE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/co-operative-bank-meeting-postponed/article30561489.ece
372,2020/01/13,BBMP parks new garbage vehicle outside head office,"The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is all set to implement the 'Indore model' on a pilot basis in five wards where the three different streams of waste – dry, wet and sanitary – will be collected in the same vehicle that comes fitted with separate containers. On Monday, the vehicle was stationed at the BBMP head office.

Mayor M. Goutham Kumar told The Hindu that the civic body had seen two designs of vehicles. While one was brought by one of the garbage contractors, the one on display was suggested by the consultant hired by the BBMP to help it implement the ‘Indore model’ in the city.

Stating that the civic body is yet to finalise the design of the vehicles for the pilot, he said the three-wheeler was compact enough to enter narrow streets. The containers are available in two different capacities. Those of the higher capacity will need a bigger vehicle, which may not be able to negotiate narrow streets.

The pilot, officials said, will be implemented in – Jogupalya (represented by the Mayor), Jakkur (represented by Ruling Party Leader K. Muneendra Kumar), Manorayapalya (represented by Opposition Leader Abdul Wajid), Mathikere (represented by Jayaprash M.C.) and Shivajinagar (represented by Farida Ishtiyaq).

Mr. Goutham Kumar said the BBMP is trying to convince the contractors, who have bagged the new tenders, to switch to these vehicles for at-a-time collection of different streams of waste. “We had stationed the vehicle at the BBMP head office all day to create awareness among contractors about the kind of vehicle we need for successful implementation of this model,” said Mr. Kumar.

He added that it is a foolproof vehicle, with minimal chances of segregated waste getting mixed. “The lettering on the vehicles is as per BBMP's norms. Prominence has been given to Kannada. The Kannada font is 60% and English is 40%,” he added.

However, waste management experts are dismayed by the BBMP's U-turn on solid waste management. The BBMP had earlier envisaged collection of wet waste daily and dry waste twice a week by ragpickers manning Dry Waste Collection Centres, and maintained that separate collection is mandated under SWM Rules, 2016. Tenders for door-to-door collection of waste had been floated in 168 wards. Though the tender process is complete, work orders are yet to be issued.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/z123eu/article30561459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGBBMPINDOREMODEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-parks-new-garbage-vehicle-outside-head-office/article30561460.ece
373,2020/01/13,Residents oppose roping in private firm for restoration of Doddakallasandra lake,"Members of five Residents’ Welfare Associations met senior officials of the Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA) to register their objections to the government’s decision to enlist corporate help to develop and maintain the 21-acre Doddakallasandra lake.

The KTCDA recently entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Prestige Group to take up work under its Corporate Social Responsibility Fund (CSR) at an expected cost of ₹1.3 crore. At the meeting on Monday, residents demanded to know why they were not consulted.

“Without consulting locals, a DPR for the lake was submitted. If we are being left out now, then I’m sure it will happen in the future as well, and that is what we are worried about,” said Jagadeeswara Rao Vade of Narayan Nagar 3rd Block RWA.

KTCDA officials promised to conduct an inspection of the lake before they take a final call, though a detailed project report for the development of the lake has also been submitted.

“We will make sure that there will be effective and sustainable restoration of Doddakallasandra lake. The lake will not be developed under Public-Private-Partnership model. We will ensure that due process of law is followed,” a senior KTCDA official told The Hindu.

Raghavendra B. Pachhapur of People’s Campaign for Right to Water said that the draft of the MoU mandates the engagement of the local community and residents to ensure sustainable management of the lake even after completion of the project. “We are worried about access to the lake during and after the rejuvenation work is completed. The government should have thought twice and consulted the locals before agreeing to CSR funding by a real estate agency which has a huge complex adjacent to the lake,” he said.

KTCDA allayed fears that residents wouldn’t have access to the lake or a say in rejuvenation. “BBMP will be the custodian of the lake. We will survey the lake before fencing it and clear encroachments, if any. As per the DPR, there will be two entrance gates that the public can use to access the lake,” the official said.

According to officials, Prestige Group will maintain the lake for 24 months after restoration. “This will only be extended based on success of the project. We will constantly monitor the restoration and maintenance,"" the official said.

When contacted, Prestige Group said they needed some time to frame a response.

Lokayukta pulls up tahsildar

The Lokayukta on Monday pulled up Bengaluru North tahsildar, in his absentia, over delay in clearing encroachments at Chikkabanavara lake and Mallasandra Gudda lake while hearing a petition filed by Namma Bengaluru Foundation (NBF) and United Bengaluru.

Justice P. Vishwanath Shetty ordered the tahsildar of Bengaluru North to remove encroachments in Chikkabanavara lake within three months and submit a report. He also ordered the removal of encroachments in Mallasandra Gudda lake in 10 days and submission of a report.

During the hearing, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) assured the bench that it would stop sewage entering Chikkabanavara lake by 2021. The Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) told the Lokayukta that a DPR for restoration of the lake was being prepared at a cost of ₹10 crore.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/jnhfao/article30560685.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGDODDAKALLASANDRALAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/residents-oppose-roping-in-private-firm-for-restoration-of-doddakallasandra-lake/article30560686.ece
374,2020/01/13,HC asks about role of corporates in lake development and maintenance,"The Karnataka High Court on Monday directed the State government to explain what type of roles are assigned to the corporate companies and organisations in development and maintenance of tanks/lakes across the State as per the appeal made by the Chief Minister as chairperson of the Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA), published in newspapers in December last year.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction during the hearing of PIL petitions related to lakes and stormwater drains.

However, the bench observed that the appeal does not mean that lakes/tanks will be handed over to private companies.

Leo Saldanha of Environment Support Group, who is a party to the PIL proceedings, pointed out to the bench that the appeal amounts to “privatisation” of lakes while pointing out that the appeal indicates that some private companies have already come forward to take up development and maintenance of 11 lakes in Bengaluru under the Corporate Social Responsibility.

In his interlocutory application, Mr. Saldanha has claimed that the government has not provided information on the manner of involving private companies while also contending that the move of KTCDA is contrary to an undertaking given to the court on involving private companies in maintenance of lakes in earlier proceedings.

Maps of lakes in State

Meanwhile, the bench directed the government to procure data of the lakes in the State available on Survey of Maps-1972 prepared by the Survey of India, and information on lakes available with the Karnataka State Remote Sensing Application Centre, Bengaluru. The bench issued direction after it was pointed out by Mr. Saldanha that data related to all lakes could be available with the two organisations when the bench sought to know the number of lakes and tanks across the State.

Waterbirds habitat survey

The bench also directed the government to extend logistic support to the survey of waterbirds habitats being conducted by Birdwatchers Field Club of Bengaluru under the guidance of ornithologist S. Subramanya, a retired professor of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Bengaluru, for updating the results of a similar survey conducted in 1989.

In his application, Mr. Saldanha pointed out that the government has not responded to their plea for logistic support to survey the lakes and tanks while clarifying that they are not seeking any fund from the government.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/e6f4wy/article30564630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-asks-about-role-of-corporates-in-lake-development-and-maintenance/article30560053.ece
375,2020/01/13,Mirrors to shame offenders who urinate in public,"The city may have got the tag of being Open Defecation Free (ODF), but for many men, Benglauru’s roads remain a public urinal. Civic officials, frustrated that even hefty fines of ₹500 have had little effect on curtailing this public menace, have hit upon a novel idea: the installation of mirrors.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has installed mirrors made of fibreglass at K.R. Market, outside ESI Hospital in Indiranagar, near Jyoti Nivas College in Koramangala, opposite the Parsi temple on Queens Road, and on Church Street. The hope is that an offender will feel some shame after seeing his reflection in the mirror.

They were installed at a cost of ₹30,000 each. Apart from shaming offenders, the objective is to also create awareness among citizens about open defecation, the ODF tag that the city has got, and the ongoing Swachh Survekshan 2020, said officials.

“The idea has received positive feedback. While there is no plan to install more mirrors, we are drawing up awareness campaigns that will be launched soon. Such campaigns have a better impact in creating public awareness,” said D. Randeep, Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management), BBMP. He added that this was suggested by an expert hired by the civic body to help get a better ranking under Swachh Survekshan 2020.

The mirrors carry awareness messages, such as 'Avoid public urination’, ‘Use public toilets', 'Stop littering, use dustbins', 'Say no to single use plastic’, ‘Carry your own bag'. The messages, however, are only in English.

They also have QR codes affixed that people can scan to get the location of the nearest public toilet. One can also get access to the BBMP's Sahaaya app, through which complaints about poor maintenance of public and community toilets could be made.

According to Mr. Randeep, the civic body has already plotted all the 680 public toilets, including 150 that are maintained through private-public partnership, on Google maps.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mvpde9/article30560988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGMIRROR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/mirrors-to-shame-offenders-who-urinate-in-public/article30559979.ece
376,2020/01/13,Bengaluru police launch QR code-based beat system,"The south east division police are looking at ways to see how technology can help improve their efficacy. They recently launched an app-based QR (quick response) code beat system in an effort to make the unit more effective and transparent. Under the old system, beat police had to manually log their movements on swiping machines installed at strategic locations on their respective beats.

In the new beat system, ‘Subahu’, they have to scan QR codes placed along their routes with their mobile phones. New QR code stickers have already been placed in the south-east division. According to senior police officials, a majority of the old devices were defunct and could not be replaced. They are GPS-enabled and will log their movements.

“As soon as the code is scanned, the officer in-charge will not only get a confirmation, but will also be able to track their movements while they are on duty through GPS. The jurisdictional inspector in-charge of the beat system will have an app with the details of the beats, the personnel and the QR code points,” said Isha Pant, DCP ( south east).

With this app, the officer in charge can also assign the day and night patrolling jobs. It allows personnel to record any untoward incident and send it to the officer concerned for further action.

“Since this beat system has longitude and latitude encoded, its very easy to monitor verify and confirm that all the beat points are covered. This will also have live chat enabled that will make this system foolproof,” Ms. Pant added.

Senior police officers have welcomed the upgrade. “Earlier, it was difficult to supervise and check all the 1,800 beat policemen doing their duty in the jurisdiction, but with QR code, the officer can monitor all beats using GPS where he or she is,” said an officer.

What sets this new system apart is the involvement of residents and people working in the neighbourhood. The QR code stickers will be put outside commercial establishments, places where people congregate and other strategic locations.

“Once the beat police scan the code, the officer in-charge and the resident or owner of the commercial establishment where the QR code sticker is put up, will get an alert,” said a senior police officer.

Residents said they were happy to be involved in the new system. “This will help us get to know where the beat policeman is,” said Rakesh Jain, a jewellery shop owner.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kx5jwl/article30555058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGNIGHTPATROL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-police-launch-qr-code-based-beat-system/article30555059.ece
377,2020/01/13,Bengaluru taxi drivers hesitant about FASTag,"One of the more problematic collection points is the Sadahalli toll plaza used by those going to or returning from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA).

Officials cite lack of cooperation from taxi drivers. S.P. Somashekar, general manager and projector director of NHAI said, “We believe that regular users of toll roads have gradually shifted to the new system and the number is likely to increase. However, at Sadahalli toll plaza, a good number of taxi drivers remain hesitant. They have been demanding toll receipt which we cannot give. We are planning to take up the matter with BIAL and other concerned authorities to educate drivers on benefits of FASTag.”

Diya Shetty, who recently used an Uber to KIA noticed that her driver had not updated to FASTag. “When I asked him why, he said that he was worried that he would be charged double the toll. He was convinced that instead of the usual ₹135, he would have to pay double,” said Diya. Another KIA passenger, who hailed an airport taxi, recounted a similar experience.

Toll booth employees said they regularly receive such complaints from taxi drivers. “They claim that for a round-trip travel from the city to the airport, they were charged ₹180. NHAI has fixed ₹135 for round trip: ₹90 while going towards the Airport and ₹45 while coming from there. Because of this problem, some of the drivers prefer to make cash payments,” said a toll booth employee.

Often, toll employees simply let motorists pass to prevent long hold ups. “Many motorists are unaware of the fact that they must keep a minimum balance. When we tell them that there is no minimum balance , they argue with us and refuse to pay cash. Other vehicles start honking causing chaos. Many times we have allowed vehicle without collecting the fee,” an employee of Sadahalli gate said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/9i242/article30551268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12FASTAG-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-taxi-drivers-hesitant-about-fastag/article30554992.ece

Notable angel investors in this round include Ramkumar Narayan, VMWare India MSD, Alok Mittal, CEO of Indifi and Saikiran Krishnamurthy of xto10x Ventures. With this funding round, the company has raised over ₹80 crore, to date.

“Global logistics is going through a disruption, and large enterprises require a platform that can help them leverage these market changes to scale faster. Pando has helped shippers and transporters address this need through a full-stack solution. This convinced us to partner with them” said T.C. Meenakshisundaram, Founder MD, Chiratae Ventures.

381,2020/01/13,"For this folk art troupe in Chennai, disability is no bar","Babu Lal, an 18-year-old from a village on the Odisha-Andhra Pradesh border, handles the silambam stick dexterously as he performs, along with other members of his dance troupe, to Kollywood numbers. He then switches position and dances with the Maan Kombu (deer horn) and performs a somersault.

His troupe is ‘Kalapai Kalaikuzhu’ -- a folk art performance group of a Greater Chennai Corporation shelter for persons with developmental disabilities. The four members of the group, all persons with disabilities, have been trained in Silambam, Maan Kombu, Poi Kal Kudhirai, Karagattam and other folk arts of Tamil Nadu.

There are 53 residents, between the ages of 12 and 53, at the shelter. Most were rescued by the police from railway stations. There are many from Tamil Nadu and a few from Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.

“Most of the members have disabilities, including mental disabilities, from birth. We selected six members between the agesof 12 and 21 and trained them in these art forms for one year. They grasped what was taught, but the challenge was to get them creative,” says V. Surya Moorthi, project co-ordinator, Hope Public Charitable Trust, which is running the shelter.

The troupe has performed at different clubs and for awareness campaigns during the Assembly elections. “Now we have only four members left, as two have been reintegrated with their families,” says Mr. Moorthi.

Babu Lal also wants to go back home. In broken Hindi, he says he is from Odisha and that he has no one to go back to. “Actually his grandparents are alive, but they do not want to take him back, because of his disability, we are guessing. This is also the case with Datta from Maharashtra. Even though we traced their parents, many refuse to take them back,” said a Chennai Corporation official.

Though the shelter wants to teach them more folk arts, it is strapped for funds to purchase costumes. “We see a positive change when they are encouraged to perform arts,” says Mr. Moorthi.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9mnob1/article30556394.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13JANTH-SHELTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/for-this-folk-art-troupe-in-chennai-disability-is-no-bar/article30556395.ece

The victim, identified as Nitishkumar, was the son of Traffic sub-inspector Shankar, of Royapuram.

A police official of the Madhavaram Traffic Investigation Wing said Nitishkumar, along with his friend, was going on a two-wheeler to his home, when a heavy truck proceeding from Madhavaram to Moolakadai suddenly turned into a by-lane, catching the motorist unawares, and leading to the accident. The driver did not turn on the indicator before making an abrupt turn, police said.

383,2020/01/13,Chennai Corporation asks for citizens’ opinions on improving Smart City services,"In a bid to improve Smart City Mission services in Chennai, residents have been requested to start giving feedback on Smart City projects across the city. Over the past few months, the Chennai Corporation and other line agencies have implemented smart city projects such as the Pedestrian Plaza in T. Nagar, the bicycle-sharing system and a parking management system.

On Monday, the Chennai Corporation is organising its first meeting of the City-Level Advisory Forum for Smart City projects. Representatives of residents’ associations and other stakeholders will participate in the meeting to discuss all aspects of the smart projects and will also compile a list of civic issues caused by such projects.

Representatives are also planning to suggest a portal to receive feedback from residents who have faced challenges in smart city projects implemented across the city. Residents who called the Corporation helpline 1913 complained that they are not able to get information on services relating to Smart City projects, as the personnel said the helpline would receive only complaints. This response violates the original idea of the Corporation to make 1913 provide all civic information to the public.

Even after the implementation of the Pedestrian Plaza project, the civic agencies are yet to put in place a system to organise events that attract visitors, strengthening the ‘commercial theme’ of the Pedestrian Plaza in T. Nagar. Similarly, residents who want to know about the benefits of smart poles in their neighbourhood are also unable to get information on such smart city facilities.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nzynr5/article30555391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13JANTH-PEDESTRIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-corporation-asks-for-citizens-opinions-on-improving-smart-city-services/article30555392.ece
384,2020/01/13,A cycle for just ₹50 at ‘reuse and reduce’ sale,"Ever heard of getting a microwave at ₹100? Or an even better deal — a refrigerator for ₹100? From clothes to electronic goods, hundreds of items were given away at nominal prices, for those in need, at Chennai Corporation’s ‘Swap Shop - Reduce and Reuse Sale’ at the Tamil Nadu Housing Board Community Hall in Besant Nagar.

Aarthi S. came in casually to take a look at the items sold in the hall and ended up buying a bicycle for her child at ₹50.

“A new bicycle will cost anywhere around ₹2,000-3,000, or even more. I am not in a position to afford it for my child, but I certainly wanted to buy her one. So when I found this, I instantly grabbed it. At least, for a year or two, she can happily ride it,” she said.

R. Meenakshi, who lives in Besant Nagar, walked in this morning to check if she can pick up some clothes for her children. After a meticulous search, she picked up a bright blue frock.

“Children grow up too fast; we cannot invest in clothes too often. Since these clothes are in good condition, I wanted to pick up a few. I’m sure she will be excited to wear it.”

While trousers, shirts and shorts were sold at ₹10, sarees were given away for ₹20 and children’s clothes for ₹10.

Tape recorders were available for ₹100 and prams for ₹200. There were toys, utensils, crockery, books and even footwear.

Alby John, Regional Deputy Commissioner, Chennai Corporation, said the idea was to exchange material that one may not need. “The concept is to give away things [that are in good condition], that you will not need. Someone else who may require it can use them. We are not giving away these things for free, but are selling them at nominal prices because people should know the value of things,” he said.

Residents can donate books, gently used clothes (washed and ironed), purses, wallets, artificial jewellery, pillowcases and blankets in good condition, raincoats, bags, umbrellas, furniture, toys and electronics in good condition on Monday too.

In October last year, the traffic police allowed right turn from these two junctions towards Teynampet on a trial basis.

However, the police claim that there were complaints about traffic pile-up on both these roads due to heavy flow of vehicles.

“Hence, from Saturday evening, we reverted to the old system. Vehicles cannot take a right turn at these junctions. We have put up barricades and we will guide the motorists on where to take the U turns,” said a police officer.

Due to this, vehicles from these two junctions have to go to Nandanam junction to take a U-turn. “This leads to a pile-up between Cenotaph junction and Nandanam junction. The traffic planning wing has to work out some alternative,” said a motorist.

A senior police officer said that as vehicles wait for the right turn at both these junctions, there is a heavy pile-up on the two stretches.

388,2020/01/13,Publisher evicted from Chennai Book Fair for displaying book against T.N. government,"A publisher-cum-author was evicted from his rented stall at the ongoing 43rd Chennai Book Fair by The Booksellers’ and Publishers’ Association of South India (BAPASI) for “violating rules and displaying for sale a controversial book against the government”.

On Sunday, the police arrested V. Anbazhagan, who wrote a book on alleged corruption in the Chennai Corporation’s Smart City project, on charges of criminally intimidating office-bearers of BAPASI on Saturday when the eviction notice was served on him.

Remanded till Jan. 24

A metropolitan magistrate in Saidapet remanded him in judicial custody till January 24.

In the eviction notice, BAPASI president R.S. Shanmugam said, “You had agreed to abide by rules of BAPASI while being allotted the stall. Selling a book against the government in your stall is a violation of these rules. Hence, we prohibit you from participating in the Book Fair and advise you to immediately vacate the stall.”

According to BAPASI secretary S.K. Murugan, all allottees of stalls, including the 450 members of the association, have to abide by a set of 25 conditions. “This rule has been there since we started the Chennai Book Fair 42 years ago, which Mr. Anbazhagan flouted” he said. [Incidentally the rule says only banned and pirated books/CDs should not be sold at the fair.]

Creates ruckus

Mr. Murugan said Mr. Anbazhagan’s application seeking a stall was rejected initially. “Then he created a ruckus claiming that he was from the media. Based on his claim that he was a journalist and hoping that he would have some good books, we gave priority and allowed him to set up a stall,” he said.

The BAPASI secretary alleged that Mr. Anbazhagan wanted to release the “controversial” book, which the association’s 21-member committee rejected. “For this again he created a scene. He along with few others came to our office and abused us. Based on police advice we gave a complaint,” he added.

Mr. Anbazhagan was booked under Section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) 294 B (utters any obscene words, in or near any public place) and section 506 IPC (criminal intimidation) of IPC.

Political party leaders, including DMK president M K Stalin and MMK leader M H Jawahirullah, condemned the arrest and sought his release.

In May 2017, Mr. Anbazhagan was detained under the Goondas Act on various charges, including blackmailing an aide of Local Administration Minister S P Velumani. However, in August that year the Madras High Court quashed his detention under the Goondas Act due to “inordinate delay on the part of government officials in considering representations from his wife seeking his release.”

On Sunday, the magistrate initially refused to remand him. “There was confusion over whether his remand was necessary. We explained the issue in detail following which he was remanded,” said a police officer.

Asked about allegations that the police had kept him in a van and were circling along a particular route, the officer said “We only took him to the Guindy police station for safe custody till the Assistant Public Prosecutor arrived.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ib5o0o/article30528011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBOOKFAIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/publisher-evicted-from-chennai-book-fair-for-displaying-book-against-tamil-nadu-government/article30552835.ece

Logan follows, by singing, “Let the air flow freely, let me take a deep breath, let me get to the finish line,” in Tamil.

Focusing on Chennai’s deteriorating air quality, a new Tamil-English rap video, Kaatha Vara Vidu: Let Chennai Breathe, by Justice Rocks, was released as a part of the Save Ennore Creek Campaign on Sunday.

The music video, shot in north Chennai, features Sofia Ashraf and Logan, singing in parts of Ennore. It has been set against the backdrop of the many chimney stacks and industries in and around the area.

A kabaddi team from north Chennai is an important part of the video, and is shown to be struggling to breathe as they go about with their warm-up and exercise. The song is inspired by the experiences of a kabaddi coach in north Chennai, who raised concerns about how pollution in the area was hurting the stamina of players and the children.

Rathindran R. Prasad, who directed the video, said even while shooting the song, they noticed that the air was quite polluted. “Previously, we had shot the Chennai Poromboke Paadal near the Ennore creek, and I remember how many of the crew members involved in the song wore masks while filming,” he said.

The team behind the #LetChennaiBreathe campaign pointed out that north Chennai produced a large number of athletes, but was also home to a number of industries that pollute. “There are not just industries, but also the constant movement of heavy vehicles. The Manali High Road in the mornings is full of dust and smoke in the mornings, and even after a short walk, we feel dust on our faces and bodies,” said Harunisha, a young resident of Thiruvottiyur, who spoke at the event.

A petition has been started with the video, appealing to the Tamil Nadu Health Minister and the Greater Chennai Corporation to come up with a time-bound plan to improve the city’s air quality to healthy levels and focus on the industrialised parts of the city, particularly the Manali-Ennore industrial cluster. .

“We tend to compare air pollution levels in Chennai with that of Delhi or Mumbai, and often end up feeling reassured that the city’s air isn’t as bad as those cities. This needs to change, and I hope people do realise that steps need to be taken to improve the air quality in our city as well,” said Sofia Ashraf.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hv3nq8/article30552675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200112-WA0034,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/north-chennais-poor-air-quality-is-the-subject-of-this-music-video/article30552676.ece

Even after a year of launching decentralised facilities and including private participation in the recycling of waste, civic officials say they are processing about 500 tonnes at these facilities.

The Corporation used to dump around 5,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste a day in Perungudi and Kodungaiyur. Despite its initiatives, the quantity of waste in the two yards is yet to go below 4,000 tonnes a day, officials add.

392,2020/01/13,Chennai residents resist waste management facility in their areas,"Elangovan E.V. filed a complaint with the Chennai Corporation about public health issues caused by a decentralised waste management facility in a residential area of Kilpauk on December 30, 2019.

“Corporation officials closed the complaint without taking any remedial measures. The problem still persists, and the stench particularly is unbearable. We have to keep the windows and doors closed. We request the senior officials to please help,” he said.

Residents in the area have started protesting, demanding that the facility be shifted to another area, away from residential buildings. They have registered a complaint online with the Corporation, for a second time, and are awaiting an official response before Pongal.

Corporation officials have told the residents that they spent so much money on developing the facility and that it cannot be shut.

“There have been instances of health issues like fever and vomiting after the commissioning of the plant,” said Kamala Kumar, another resident.

Unit closed

V. Rajagopal, a resident of Officers’ Colony, Mogappair, said residents had stopped decentralised processing at their park, and no structure was erected after their protest. “They have closed it now,” he said.

Several residents’ associations have been opposing these plants, causing a delay in the implementation of decentralised waste management projects across the city.

Following decentralisation of waste management and a reduction in manpower of the Corporation, yet another problem — dumping of waste on vacant plots has increased, leading to public health issues.

Mugalivakkam resident K.S. Kannan said residents had started carrying waste in their vehicles and are dumping it on vacant plots at night. “Many areas do not have bins. There is no door-to-door collection. Bins have been removed. So residents dump waste on vacant plots in residential areas. It is a breeding ground for rats and mosquitoes. The Corporation has warned that they will impose a fine of ₹500 on those found dumping waste in vacant plots. But there is no third eye to identify the culprits. The problem continues,” he said.

Starting April, the Corporation will directly collecting waste only from four zones — Tondiarpet, Royapuram, Thiru.Vi.Ka Nagar and Anna Nagar. The private sector is set to play a dominant role in conservancy operations.

In addition to Corporation officials, private players, who have been empanelled for wet and dry waste management in decentralised facilities, have been unable to contribute to the reduction of waste dumped in Perungudi and Kodungaiyur.

Role of private sector

“It is only the early days. The role of private players in waste management has been promoted in the last one year and it slowly started becoming a movement. There needs to be a sustained effort, highlighting the problems caused by dumping of waste in Perungudi and Kodungaiyur. The public needs to be taught about all aspects of the project to reduce dumping in Perungudi and Kodungaiyur,” said Kern Agrawal of Carbon Loops, which has been empanelled by the Corporation for waste processing.

“We implemented the zero waste concept for a hotel chain on January 1. We pick up waste from residents in Manapakkam and compost the waste in Loyola College. We also take the city’s waste to Uthiramerur and compost it,” said Mr. Agrawal.

Corporation officials said many innovations in decentralised waste management and private sector participation would be promoted in six months. “Start-ups will revolutionise waste management in 2020. Residents’ cooperation is the key,” said an official.

This year, civic agencies are planning to strengthen the movement to rope in more private companies, who are expected to adopt appropriate technology to segregate waste and use it for industries as inputs. Other stakeholders, including ragpickers, will also be able to contribute significantly to the new system of waste management.

The Corporation has also launched solid waste collection involving private participation in more areas .

393,2020/01/13,Chennai Bird Race 2020: introducing people to joys of birdwatching,"How many species of birds can one spot in and around Chennai in a day?

From dawn to dusk on January 26, the Madras Naturalists’ Society is organising the 13th edition of the Chennai Bird Race, where participants can visit various spots in the city and record their findings.

“Our aim has been to introduce more people to the joys of birdwatching. When we begin a conversation about conservation and protection, it is important to involve the public for it to be a people’s movement,” said K.V. Sudhakar, president, Madras Naturalists’ Society.

While earlier editions of the Bird Race had people compete to spot the maximum number of birds in a day, the society has done away with the competition aspect of it this time, said Mr. Sudhakar.

In the previous edition, 28 teams participated in the Bird Race, and among the rare species spotted were the Bar headed goose at the Great Salt Lake; Tree Pipit at Thaiyur Lake; Pallas’ Grasshopper Warbler at Perumbakkam tank; Slender-billed Gull at Adyar estuary; and the Brown Hawk owl at IIT-Madras.

Participants will be divided into teams of four, and for persons who wish to participate but have no prior experience of birdwatching, members of the Madras Naturalists’ Society will accompany them. “Teams will be given a 160-page booklet on the list of species they have a chance of spotting in Chennai. At the end of the day, we usually convene and discuss our findings and experiences,” he said.

Stressing on the need to be environmentally conscious, Mr. Sudhakar said ‘Green Birders’ could also participate in the race. “They only use public transport to get around the city and we encourage such eco-friendly practices,” he added.

Those wishing to register for the Chennai Bird Race either as an individual or a team, can log onto www.blackbuck.org.in and register before January 22.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/11n81r/article30552603.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THBIRDRACEPIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-bird-race-2020-introducing-people-to-joys-of-birdwatching/article30552604.ece
394,2020/01/13,"In martyrdom moment for Iran, America’s own goal","The death of Qassem Soleimani, one of the most important military leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who designed and executed the spread of Iranian power across West Asia, is a blow to the regime. For over two decades, he commanded the Qods Force, the external security and intelligence operations unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. His assassination, by a U.S. drone outside Baghdad airport on January 3, did not only point to the Islamic regime’s inability to protect the life of a top General but also left a hole in Iran’s credible deterrence. But a bigger question is this: do these military setbacks weaken the regime? What appears to be happening is just the contrary.

Till a few weeks ago, the regime was fighting to quell widespread dissent and protests. Economic hardships, largely because of crippling American sanctions along with the oppressive policies of the government, had triggered mass rallies across the country in early December, which were put down brutally. Hundreds were feared killed by the security personnel and thousands arrested. The regime was in an embattled state. But a few weeks later, millions thronged the streets of Tehran, Mashhad, Ahvaz, Qom and Kerman to mourn the death of a military leader and a staunch defender of the Islamic revolution in one of the greatest displays of public support for the regime. Soleimani united the several political factions in Iran through his martyrdom, which he could not even have dreamt of when he was alive.

This unprecedented emotional display for a general who U.S. President Donald Trump called a “terrorist” has its roots in Iran’s history and faith. Iran is a civilisation state, not just a nation state. For centuries it has remained a political entity, even before the idea of a modern nation state emerged, defined by Persian civilisation. Since the Safavid dynasty adopted Shia Islam as the official religion of the empire, Iran (Persia) has been majority Shia. And since the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi monarchy, the two key pillars that carried the revolutionary state were political Shiism and nationalism. In Iran, martyrdom is one of the central tenets of both. Shias revere their martyrs, starting from Imam Ali. By making Soleimani, an adherent of the Shia Islamic revolution, a martyr, Mr. Trump, knowingly or unknowingly, has stirred emotions of this collective victimhood of the Shias and the nationalist pride of millions of Iranians.

Politics of martyrdom

After Prophet Mohammed’s death, his followers were divided on who should be his successor as the rightful leader of the ummah (the Muslim community). One faction wanted the successor from Mohammed’s family. They supported Ali, the Prophet’s cousin and son-in-law, while the other faction supported Abu Bakr, a companion of the Prophet. Abu Bakr became the first Caliph. Ali eventually became the fourth Caliph. The supporters of Ali became Shias and the followers of the Rashidun Caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali) became Sunnis. Ali’s reign was marked by conflicts within the Islamic community and he was killed amid the Sunni-Shia power struggle, becoming the first martyr of Shia Islam. His son, Hassan, the second Imam of the Shias, assumed the Caliphate but would soon abdicate in the face of growing challenges and threats from the Umayyads. Hussein, Ali’s second son, refused to pledge loyalty to the Umayyads ruler, Yazid. In 680, Hussein and 72 of his followers were killed in Karbala, in today’s Iraq, by the army of Yazid. Hussein, who is the third Shia Imam, was beheaded and his head was brought to Damascus for Caliph Yazid.

The Battle for Karbala holds enormous significance in both Shia faith and political Shiism. For the Shia believers, the Imam who refused to compromise on his beliefs even at the expense of his life, was the epitome of sacrifice. For political Shias, the Imam who challenged the corrupt Yazid caliphate was the epitome of courage. (Shias across the world take out Ashura processions on the 10th of Muharram, the first month of the Islamic calender, to commemorate the martyrdom of Hussein.) During the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Khomeini had invoked both sacrifice and courage to mobilise the public against the rule of the Shah, Reza Pahlavi. The monarch, according to Khomeini, was the new Yazid. He urged Hussein’s followers, the oppressed, to rise. And it worked. Millions, from different streams of politics, joined the uprising against the Shah, forcing him to flee. After the monarchy’s collapse, the Islamists captured the state in 1979, and turned it into an Islamic republic.

After the revolution, many experts and world leaders expected that the Mullahs would not be able to retain power in a country that was modern and secular. Within a year of the revolution, then Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, launched an invasion to precipitate the expected fall of the Ayatollah. It was a time when the Mullahs were finding it difficult to stabilise the post-revolutionary country. Leftists, trade unionists, Islamists and liberals had all joined the protests against the Shah and the Mullahs’ capturing of the leadership of the revolution had created fissures within this coalition. But when Saddam attacked Iran, it became easy for Khomeini to mobilise people behind his leadership. Saddam was the new Yazid. The Islamic regime carried out a brutal purge against leftists and liberals at home without triggering any regime-threatening public response while the war was under way. In other words, the war Saddam launched with help from the Sunni kingdoms in the region as well as the U.S. helped the Mullahs tighten their grip on Iran. During the war, Iranians carried out several suicide attacks against Iraqi troops, because for them “martyrdom” is god’s approval of their path. For most Shia militias in the region, from Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Badr Brigade in Iraq, martyrdom is the bravest path to the “heavenly abode”.

A misreading

What is unfolding now in Iran and Iraq has echoes from the past. In March 2019, while awarding the Order of Zulfaqar to Soleimani, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader, said, “I hope that Allah the Exalted will reward and bless him (Soleimani) with a blissful life and that He will make his end marked by martyrdom. Of course, not so soon.” In less than a year, Soleimani is a martyr. By making him one, the U.S. has actually played into the political Shia narrative. For a political ideology that thrives in the memory of victimhood, persecution, the martyrdom of Soleimani is as much a blessing as a setback. That is where Mr. Trump has erred.

What is the best outcome the U.S. could expect from this ongoing conflict with Iran? It is a change in the regime with minimum cost. An invasion would be catastrophic and there is no guarantee that the regime would still fall. The other risk-free option, which the U.S. appears to be pursuing, is to squeeze the Iranian economy, and create internal discord that could cumulatively weaken the regime. But then Mr. Trump decides to take out Qassem Soleimani, stirring up nationalist and religious passions, allowing Ayatollah Khamenei to seize the moment. Mr. Trump may not have realised that he has just scored an own goal.

395,2020/01/13,The warp and weft of religious liberty,"In December 2014, the Supreme Court of India placed a temporary ban on madesnana, a 500-year-old ritual performed at the Kukke Subramanya Temple in Karnataka. The practice involves persons, in particular those from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, rolling over plantain leaves left behind with food half eaten by Brahmins, in the belief that doing so would cleanse their skin of impurities.

Initially, in 2012, at the behest of a group of progressive-minded petitioners, including the seer of the Nidumamidi Math, a division bench of the Karnataka High Court put a halt to the ritual, but allowed it to continue in a modified form. Devotees could now voluntarily choose to roll over leaves containing prasada, that is offering made to the deity, so long as the food was not “tasted or partially eaten by the members of any community”. But this order was lifted two years later by another division bench of the High Court, which found little wrong with madesnana in its supposedly “original” form. The practice, the court said, did not, on its face, violate any law. What is more, in the judges’ belief, a proscription of the ritual until a final ruling was delivered would both hurt the sentiments of devotees and impinge on their constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of religion.

What is at stake

It is cases such as this and many more, including the practice of female genital mutilation and the rights of Parsi women to enter fire temples, which are at stake when a nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court begins hearing arguments on questions concerning the relationship between the right to freedom of religion and the rights of individuals to dignity and equality. The establishment of the Bench emanated out of an order of reference made on review petitions filed against the Sabarimala judgment. But when the Bench assembles today, its remit will involve a rather more abstract exercise: to answer a series of wide-ranging questions and to expound the scope and extent of the Constitution’s religious liberty clauses.

In answering these questions, the Court will be faced with a difficult question of balance. Within the Constitution of India, there are two impulses that may, at times, come into conflict with one another. The first impulse recognises that India is a pluralist and diverse nation, where groups and communities — whether religious or cultural — have always played an important role in society. Following up on this impulse, the Constitution recognises both the freedom of religion as an individual right (Article 25), as well as the right of religious denominations to manage their own affairs in matters of religion (Article 26). The second impulse, on the other hand, recognises that while community can be a source of solidarity at the best of times, it can also be a terrain of oppression and exclusion. The Constitution, therefore, expressly provides for the possibility that there may be times when members of religious and cultural communities may need to be protected from authoritarian and oppressive social practices. Thus, both Articles 25 and 26 are subject to public order, morality, and health; and further, Article 25 is also subject to other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and to the state’s power to bring in social reform laws.

These two impulses, and their expression in various provisions of the Constitution, speak to an observation made by Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer, one of the foremost drafters of the Constitution: that in our country, religion and social life are inextricably linked. As the madesnana example shows us, religious proscriptions often spill over into broader society, and religious and social status often reinforce each other. A classic example, of course, is that of the practice of “untouchability”, which the Constitution explicitly prohibits. Another is the practice of “excommunication”, a practice prevalent among certain communities, where the head of the community has the power to expel recalcitrant members, and exclude them entirely from any form of interaction with their former friends or families.

Finding the middle ground

How then do we strike a balance between respecting the autonomy of cultural and religious communities and also ensuring that individual rights are not entirely sacrificed at the altar of the community? Over the years, the Supreme Court has attempted to do so by carving out a jurisprudence that virtually allows it to sit in theological judgment over different practices. It has done this by recognising that it is only those practices that are “essential” to religion that enjoy constitutional protection. Any other ritual is seen as secular and amenable to the state’s interference.

This doctrine of essential practices has invariably seen the Court play the role of a moral arbiter. It invoked it, for example, to rule, in 2004, that the performance of the Tandava dance was not an essential tenet of the religious faith of the Ananda Margis, even though the followers of the religion conscientiously believed it to be so. Similarly, the Court, especially during the tenure of Chief Justice of India P.B. Gajendragadkar, struck down a number of rituals across religions on the grounds that those practices were embodiments of superstition as opposed to faith. But was the Court at all competent to make this distinction? Many scholars have argued that it was not: the idea of a secular Court sits uneasily with investigations into the nature of religious practice. In response, the Court has often stated that the “essential religious practices” test is indeed the only way it can reconcile the two impulses of respecting religious autonomy and enforcing individual rights.

The anti-exclusion principle

For these reasons, one option before the nine-judge Bench would simply be to affirm existing jurisprudence, as it stands, and has been incrementally developed over the years. That would certainly not be an unacceptable position to take.

There are, however, other ways. One way, for example, would be to ask whether the effect of the disputed religious practice is to cause harm to individual rights. Madesnana, for example, is a clear violation of human dignity. A few years ago, the Bombay High Court found (similarly) that the exclusion of women from the inner sanctum of the Haji Ali Dargah was an indefensible violation of equality. The enquiry, thus, is not whether the practice is truly religious, but whether its effect is to subordinate, exclude, or otherwise send a signal that one set of members is entitled to lesser respect and concern than others. Interestingly, in the Sabarimala case — out of which this reference arose — both the concurring opinion of Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and the dissenting opinion of Justice Indu Malhotra agreed that this ought to be the test; their disagreement was limited to whether, in the specific case of the Sabarimala temple, the practice, on its facts, was exclusionary or not.

An articulation of the anti-exclusion principle would also take into account an important truth. In many religious communities, norms and practices are shaped and imposed from above, by community leaders, and then enforced with the force of social sanction. Dissenters are then faced with an impossible choice: either comply with discriminatory practices, or make a painful (and often unsustainable) exit from the community. It is here that the Constitution can help by ensuring that the oppressed and excluded among communities can call upon the Court for aid, and by ensuring that powerful communities are not exempt from guaranteeing the basic norms of fairness, equality, and freedom to all their members.

When the hearings begin today, therefore, the nine-judge Bench will face a difficult and delicate task of constitutional interpretation. Much will ride upon its decision: the rights of women in particular (a group that has long been at the receiving end of discriminatory practices) and of many other vulnerable groups in general but also, the constitutional vision of ensuring a life of dignity and equality to all, both in the public sphere and in the sphere of community.

396,2020/01/13,Demonetisation’s impact on economy,"The country has reluctantly eased into the classical Hindu growth of rate of 3%, which is actually what the reported 4.5% now is. Between 1990 and say 2014, it struggled and succeeded in getting out of this rut, to chart an admirable growth rate path. In the process, it gained the means to reduce poverty levels substantially. The clock has turned back now. It is as remarkable as mystifying as to how this government, in a span of three years, turned the story of the economy into a misery. It lacks knowledge and experience on its own, has been shunning sane advices and seems highly prone to unilateralism. The key to revival now is entirely dependent on reversing the extensive damages caused to the huge informal economy by demonetisation. There is total lack of appreciation of the uniqueness of our informal economy, its largely honest nature, it being the actual backbone of the real consuming section of the population and it being the actual edifice of the formal economy. All the past governments understood this unique feature of our economy and preserved that role. Not this government, which was bent upon formalising the total economy, for whatever the reasons. This was a totally unilateral approach, in total disregard for its experience. The country is now paying dearly for this ‘I-know-all’ thinking. It will take 10 years now to catch up with where we were in 2014.

397,2020/01/13,Australia fires,"The wildfires fanned by dry hot weather in Australia represent an ecological and humanitarian catastrophe of enormous proportions. The blood-red skies, spreading fires with apocalyptic fury, black smoke-filled atmosphere and kangaroos indigenous to Australia hopping to safety (or being not able to make it) bespeak the intensity of the fires and overwhelm us with awe. Smoke from the fire has reached as far as Chile and Argentina.

It is next to impossible to comprehend or assess the scale of the disaster. The official casualty figure has reached 28. The timely evacuation of entire communities has saved lives before they were engulfed by the blazing inferno. The extreme bushfires have charred vast tracts of lands, mainly in New South Wales and Queensland beyond recognition. One estimate puts the charred area at about 13 million hectares. The raging fires have ripped through natural habitats of innumerable species of flora and fauna, resulting in the depletion of their numbers. Millions of animals are feared to have perished in the fires.

Inevitably, the air quality is at a hazardous level; smoke-filled atmosphere has caused a health crisis. Air pollution caused by the mega fires is so bad that there has been a rise in lung-related diseases in fire-ravaged areas. The unprecedented fires spurred by high temperatures have crippled the Australian economy; the Aussies indeed need a lot of generous donations for economic regeneration. It is heartening to know that the world’s top players in various games are planning ‘exhibition matches’ to raise funds for the post-fire reconstruction of Australia. The fires are a wake-up call to Australia; it has to now drastically reduce its export of coal and its carbon emissions to secure a relatively safer future.

The exemplary coordination among the district administration, the law enforcement officials, the fire-safety services and the private company that was in charge of the demolitions was on display as the flats were razed down. The locals also need to be praised for not creating any impediments in the implementation of the Supreme Court decision. It was a landmark day for Kerala and restored the people’s faith in the government. Hopefully, citizens and officials will henceforth desist from violating environmental norms (Front page, “Biting the dust,” Jan. 12).

Though it was a ‘wonderfully executed’ with almost zero damage to nearby structures and vegetation, it was painful that the 19-storey complex H2O Holy faith and twin towers of Alfa Serene were pulled down by controlled explosions at Maradu, near Kochi in compliance with a Supreme Court order. Owning a home, however small, is everyone’s dream and the act has shattered the dreams of the owners in the said complex. Did they construct the complex overnight on their own without anyone’s knowledge? Did the builders not know that the construction of the complex violated the prescribed Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms? Were they officials of the CRZ passing through the complex area with blind-folded eyes when the construction of not one but a couple of high-rise buildings was going on? Were the officials of other government machinery like the Registering Authority, the Kerala State Electricity Board, Water Supply and Drainage Board, and so on, not aware that the complex construction was in violation of the CRZ norms? It is not enough that meagre compensation was given to the erstwhile flat owners but the entire officials who cleared the complex construction and the politicians, if any, without whose connivance such a massive blunder/violation of norms could not have been done, should be brought to book and penalised by collecting from them due compensation and giving it to the affected owners of the flats.

400,2020/01/13,Iran’s mea culpa,"By admitting that its own missile shot down the Ukraine International Airlines jet last week, Iran has put an end to a debate on who could have been behind the disaster. The country should now reach out to those nations whose unsuspecting citizens became the victims what it calls an act of “human error” (Front page, “Iran admits its missile shot down Ukraine jet,” Jan. 12). In this context, one is reminded of a similar incident in 1988 when a guided missile cruiser of U.S. Navy shot down Iran Air Flight 655 over Iran’s territorial waters, killing all 290 people on board. It took quite some time for the then-U.S. President Ronald Reagan to express regret while still insisting that the country’s officers acted in self-defence. In contrast, Tehran has been more gracious in acknowledging its mistake. In this regard, the UN must take the initiative and devise a more effective mechanism for averting such tragedies in future.

S.K. Choudhury,

Bengaluru

It may be possible for Iran to compensate the kin of the victims but it remains to be seen how the country will bring the guilty to book. In this context, it may be recalled that the U.S. has not only never expressed remorse for shooting down an Iranian passenger plane using a surface-to-air missile in 1988, it has also shown the audacity to maintain that there was no improper use of force. Its payment of compensation later was only a tacit admission of guilt.

C.G. Kuriakose,

Kothamangalam, Kerala

Though the Iranian authorities magnanimously accepted their mistake, shooting down a civilian plane was an unpardonable act. In the war-like situation prevailing in Iran, there was a possibility of the missile man mistaking the passenger jet for a cruise missile. But, that cannot be taken as an excuse, when there were communication facilities available between the pilot and the airport. The guilty should be made accountable and punished, as demanded by Ukraine.

D. Sethuraman,

Chennai

Iran’s mea culpa in the tragic shooting down of a Ukrainian passenger jet is a sign of contrition, but its attempt to trivialise the disaster’s cause as a missile operator’s misjudgment glosses over its complicity in creating a war-like situation by the frenzied ratcheting up of tensions after the assassination of one of its top generals. Iran’s right to self-defence and its right to retaliate against the U.S for the unprovoked killing of a military commander provided it with a margin of international support and sympathy. But even an undeclared war demands nations to ensure the safety of civilians likely to be in the crossfire of fighting. When Iran planned a missile attack against American targets, it should have issued a ‘no flight’ advisory to civilian aircraft using Iranian airspace. The avoidable loss of human lives makes the wrangling over the intricacies of international laws a travesty. Having admitted its horrific mistake, Iran should carry forward the process of healing and reconciliation by offering fair financial compensation to the families of the ill-fated jet’s crew and passengers without waiting for the international law’s protracted proceedings to run their normal course.

401,2020/01/13,What 2020 holds for banking,"Slowing credit growth due to widespread risk averseness among banks amid a slowing economy dominated the financial sector discourse in the latter part of 2019. There are, however, nascent signs of improvement in health of commercial banks, with improving assets quality and return to profitability after a gap of seven years in the first half of the current financial year.

While credit revival, essential to support growth, will be closely watched, following are five important developments, the outcome of which will shape the banking sector in 2020.

Yes Bank: need for a Fairfax

Private sector lender Yes Bank dominated headlines in the closing months of 2019, albeit for the wrong reasons. The bank is in desperate need of capital to fund its growth and has shortlisted investors, but nothing has been finalised so far. The delay in fundraising led to a rating downgrade. The absence of marquee names among investors has not boosted confidence, since some them will need regulatory clearances as their stake in the lender could go above 5%.

A hitherto sleepy old generation private sector lender CSB Bank — the erstwhile Catholic Syrian Bank — recently had a successful IPO as investors confidence was boosted after billionaire Indo-Canadian billionaire businessman Prem Watsa’s Fairfax picked up a majority stake and infused the much-needed capital. Probably, Yes Bank needs a Fairfax to instil confidence among its stakeholders.

Who will step into Aditya Puri’s shoes

The longest-serving chief of any Indian commercial bank, HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri will hang up his boots in October 2020. Mr. Puri was at the helm of affairs from 1994, since the inception of the most valuable Indian lender, which with a deep penetration among retail customers became the largest private sector lender a few years ago In November 2019, HDFC Bank formed a six-member panel to find a successor for Mr. Puri, and the announcement of the new chief could come well before his tenure ends as the bank would like to have a overlap period between the incumbent and successor.

When will interest rate cuts return

After reducing interest rate for five consecutive monetary policy reviews, the Reserve Bank of India took a pause in the December policy review despite falling economic growth. The move surprised the market, but the central bank flagged inflation concerns.

The CPI inflation projection is revised upwards by RBI to 5.1-4.7% for the second half of 2019-20 and 4.0-3.8% for the first half of 2020-21. Inflation over 5% essentially rules out any rate reduction in the first policy of 2020 in February as the RBI targets 4% inflation in the medium term. The recent spike in the headline inflation numbers are due to rise in food inflation, and it is to be seen when the numbers start cooling off to provide some space to the central bank for further easing the monetary policy.

DHFL insolvency

Mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd. is the first financial sector entity (and till now the only one) to be admitted for bankruptcy proceedings after the rules were amended. A timely resolution of DHFL is crucial for the lenders, as it has an exposure of over ₹84,000 crore making it the largest insolvency proceedings ever. Despite a few successes, the bankruptcy proceedings has been long-drawn. Banks would hope the DHFL resolution is achieved within the new 330-day timeline.

PSB mega merger

A mega merger of public sector banks involving folding of 10 banks into four was announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in 2019. The aim was to complete the process by March 31, 2020, so that the merged entities can start operations from the start of the financial year. The Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank merger was completed in about six months. But this time, the scale in much bigger. A smooth merger of these entities is essential so that the credit flow and the other banking operations are not disrupted.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/eljr2s/article30553335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Unstable-Business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/what-2020-holds-for-banking/article30553336.ece
402,2020/01/13,Battery Dance Company to perform at EVAM,"The fifth edition of the EVAM dance festival, will see the world-acclaimed Battery Dance Company premiering their work, ‘The Red Line’ by Slovenia-born choreographer Tadej Brdnik.

The festival brings to Mumbai a variety of dancing events, ranging from different forms and workshops for dance students, which includes a body conditioning and fitness workshop by Amith Kumar from DanceWorx and a Bharatanatyam workshop by Rama Vaidyanthan.

Germ of an idea

“The idea of the festival germinated as a sore point for me while attending programmes in Mumbai. I found that classical dance programmes had very limited patronage and participation, most performances were attended by friends and family of the dancer or other dancers,” says Keerthana Ravi, founder of EVAM, who feels that this festival helps in bridging the gap between the artistes and dance lovers. “I feel that the layperson is not drawn to watch a classical performance and this will result in fewer platforms and opportunities for dances.”

The festival is divided into two segments. The first segment will commence on Monday at the Summet Nagdev Dance Company studio in Dadar, with a screening of award-winning documentary Moving Stories, which showcases how a particular art form can bring about positive changes in the society. The documentary revolves around Battery Dance, the New York-based dance company’s journey around the world, and how they tell their stories through dance.

“Battery Dance is distinguished by several aspects. Our aspiration to great provocative, compelling works of artistry and high sense of technique and craft is combined with a passion for social impact and engagement with community, at home and overseas during our performances,” says Jonathan Hollander, artistic director and founder Battery Dance Company, which has performed in 70 countries since its inception in 1976.

Mr. Hollander believes that dance is the art form which he has experienced in an intense manner. “As unlikely as it sounds, the fact that I had delved into literary, musical, theatrical and visual arts first prepared me to engage in dance in a very full way, bringing in all of my earlier experiences.”

Two parts

The second segment of the festival, which commences in February, will feature Kathak exponent Pandit Uma Dogra and Bharatnatyam exponent Rama Vaidyanathan. “These performances, which will be accompanied by live musical ensemble, will be held in an intimate space which will make for an inward journey between the artiste and the audience,” says Ms. Ravi.

Although people can watch the performances of artistes and lesser popular arts forms on the Internet, Ms. Ravi emphasised the experience of witnessing a performance first hand. “The experience and joy of watching a performance live and engaging with the art form is possible only through these festivals. Dance transports you to another world where you can let your imagination run that magic is what leaves indelible impressions in one’s mind,” says Ms. Ravi, who believes that all art forms needs visibility and promotion.

Talking about the challenges and hardships the festival organisers go through, Ms. Ravi says, “The audiences are more demanding in terms of quality and content and are open to younger artistes and new-age experiments. Overall, there is a pressure on the organiser and artiste to deliver high quality performances cause you don’t want to lose even one of them for the next time.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6f5za3/article30553331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bmBattery-Dance-Durga-HR-022616-6174,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/battery-dance-company-to-perform-at-evam/article30553332.ece
403,2020/01/13,Music lovers of all ages come together for Singathon,"From five-year-old children to those in the their 80s, the preliminary round of Singathon, a competition for trained and untrained “bathroom” singers drew 350 participants on Sunday.

Part of the proceeds of Singathon, conceptualised by Manasi-Kelkar Tambe, daughter of Marathi singer Uttara Kelkar, will go towards a water conservation project. The competition was organised by Swarmaanas, founded by Ms. Tambe. Singathon’s aim is ‘Anybody can sing’.

“I had left my foundation course at the age of 24 due to family duties. But now I am back to basics, since my family is settled now. I can say, I have got back to my original love of singing,” said an elated 60-year-old Shubhada Gupte, one of the participants. Ms. Gupte sang an old romantic Bollywood number after having taken up a short-term singing course for the past one year.

Ten-year-old Nia Dhuru, who came with her parents for the second consecutive year and who was also a finalist last year, said she was a little more aware of the concept this year and more prepared. “I sang Lata Mangeshkar’s classic ‘Unse Mili Nazar’ this year. I would love to come here again next year even if I don’t win this year either.”

The youngest of the lot was five-year-old Isha Desai from Thane, who sang the children’s favourite, ‘Lakdi ki Kathi’.

This year, Singathon has tied up with Raah Foundation, an NGO working for the tribals of Jawahar and Mokhada in Palghar district. Part of the proceedings collected from the participants will be donated to a water conservation project for the underprivileged.

Ms. Tambe, who is a music teacher, said, “If people can run a marathon for a cause, why can’t they sing for a cause and call it a singathon? There is a singer hidden in everyone, and I am just trying to give them a much-needed impetus.”

Also a practising counsellor, Ms. Tambe said she has seen the happiness on the faces of people who come regularly for her weekly classes. “We are giving equal opportunity to everyone to try singing. I believe that singing is the only art that accompanies you till the last breath and gives you happiness.”

Sonia Risbood, chief operating officer of Raah Foundation, said Singathon is non-judgemental as it celebrates the spirit of singing. “I am happy that together we can work for the tribals of Jawhar in Palghar district.”

Fifteen shortlisted finalists, five from each age group, will perform on Friday at Veer Savarkar Auditorium, Dadar.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1m9avd/article30553312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMsingathon-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/music-lovers-of-all-ages-come-together-for-singathon/article30553314.ece
404,2020/01/13,Weekend of fun and games for furry friends,"The third edition of Pet Fed, a pet festival, saw over 800 dogs and cats take part in numerous activities over the weekend at Juhu.

On day one on Saturday, 818 pets dogs and cats took part in numerous activities like ‘biscuits building’, ‘fab Indie’, ‘temptation alley’ and ‘cosplay’. An international cat show in association with World Cat Federation was held on Sunday.

Akshay Gupta, founder, Pet Fed, said they were overwhelmed with the positive response from the people of Mumbai. “The city has exceeded my expectations. It is heart-warming to see such enthusiasm towards good causes. We also ended up getting a lot of Indie dogs adopted in association with our animal welfare partners,” he said.

Actor Minissha Lamba, who came with her pets Chloe and Zoey, said she wished there were more events where pets and parents could come and have a day out with their children. “And I wish to have more of these in Mumbai,” she said.

On Sunday, there was a special security police dog show in the presence of renowned dog trainers, and actor Dino Morea.

Pet Fed also organised a cat show with international judges, a first in the city. NGOs from across Mumbai brought adoptable animals for anyone interested in adding a furry friend to their family. “It is important to encourage adopting an Indie pet. They’re just as good as any breed animal,” Mr. Gupta said.

A special agility and play area, spanning 10,000 square feet — including a fully indoor cat zone — was also well received as pets got a chance to stretch their legs and socialise.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rvc68x/article30553292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMPet-Fed-MumbaiIndiaa-Biggest-Pet-Festival---Day-2-7,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/weekend-of-fun-and-games-for-furry-friends/article30553293.ece
405,2020/01/13,"Not all PMC Bank depositors withdrew their full ₹50,000","A large number of Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank depositors are yet to tap the ₹50,000 withdrawal limit per account, stipulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Just ₹400 crore has been withdrawn from PMC Bank in the past two months, as opposed to an estimated ₹1,300 crore outflow from the entity after the RBI relaxed withdrawal limits for its account holders in November 2019.

The troubled bank was placed under RBI restrictions due to financial irregularities in September 2019, and the withdrawal limit was initially set at a meagre ₹1,000 per account before being enhanced gradually.

The banking regulator expected more than 78% of the bank’s depositors to be able to withdraw their entire account balance with the ₹50,000 cap, but data suggests many are staying with the bank for now, reducing immediate pressure on the bank on the payouts front.

“This would mean smaller depositors are not so much worried about their money. Only the bigger depositors, who have deposit of over ₹1 crore are more worried,” said a source.

The number of depositors having deposits above ₹1 crore is 635. Apart from individual depositors, there are many housing societies, employee societies and religious trusts with deposits of ₹1 crore and above. These also include two employee societies of the RBI, with total deposits of around ₹200 crore.

The RBI’s restrictions had caused panic and triggered widespread protests among depositors, as PMC Bank is a reasonably large cooperative lender with a deposit base of ₹11,617 crore as on March 2019.

HDIL loan principal

While securitised assets of the bank’s top defaulting borrower HDIL are being formally valued, it is expected that these assets may be able to cover the principal loan dues from HDIL.

The total outstanding due of HDIL to the bank are around ₹6,500 crore, which account for over 73% of PMC’s total assets. However, sources said the principal amount was only ₹2,000 crore and the remaining part is accrued interest accumulated over the years.

It was alleged that PMC had extended loans to real estate developer HDIL which had defaulted some years back, but the bank had not classified the loan as non-performing.

A process to find the realisable value of HDIL securities in PMC Bank’s custody, is now underway. Initial indications are that the realisable value of those securities could be to the tune of ₹2,000 crore.

A forensic audit of PMC Bank’s troublesome loan accounts, including the HDIL account, is currently underway. RBI expects the final report of the forensic audit this month, following which the future course of action will be decided.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ilvyro/article30415018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH27PMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/not-all-pmc-bank-depositors-withdrew-their-full-50000/article30553287.ece
406,2020/01/13,Experts meet to discuss impact of Metro on city,"Around 50 people gathered at Pragnya Bodhini High School in Goregaon this weekend to discuss the Mumbai Metro project and its impact on the future of the city.

Speakers included lawyer Hema Ramani, urban conservationist Shweta Wagh, urban researcher Hussain Indorewala and leopard researcher Nikit Surve from the Wildlife Conservation Society India.

Public transport or not

Condemning the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation for the car shed in Aarey colony, Mr. Indorewala said, “The BEST bus system is the one of the most affordable and economically inclusive forms of transport. However, I don’t know why building of Metro rails is given greater preference in the name of public transport, because it is debatable whether they even qualify as public transport.”

He said the tribal hamlets that occupy the Aarey colony depend mostly on plantation for their livelihood, and will have to relocate if the trees are felled. “The relocation will shift the community to houses that come under the rehabilitation and resettlement plan, which, I fear, will make the community face the same impediments the residents of Mahul are facing due to their relocation,” Mr. Indorewala said.

Larger footprint

Ms. Ramani said people should be more sensitive when it comes to doing away with trees. “People keep questioning activists as to why they were not complaining about the Film City built around Aarey. The footprint created due to the Film City is far smaller than what the Metro car shed can lead to,” she said.

Poor planning

Ms. Wagh blamed the authorities for poor planning and mapping of the project.

“The MMRDA has constantly maintained that the Mithi is not a river, but a tribal settlement around the Mithi experienced flooding this year, which has never happened before. This could be a direct result of ongoing infrastructural developments in Aarey, where the Mithi has a catchment area. The zoo and Metro shed will block Aarey’s continuity to Sanjay Gandhi National Park,” Ms. Wagh said.

Home to species

Mr. Surve, meanwhile, said Aarey may not be considered a forest, but it is home to several species like tarantulas and spiders that have been named after it.

“The Chrysilla volupe spider’s female counterpart was found after 139 years after its male was discovered. It is also home to leopards who live like the people in Aarey live. These leopards are equally scared of humans as humans are of them. The recent developments are a threat to the entire ecosystem and several rare species,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/experts-meet-to-discuss-impact-of-metro-on-city/article30553284.ece
407,2020/01/13,Boisar factory blast: cause of mishap yet to be ascertained,"The death toll in the explosion at a chemical factory in Palghar district rose to eight on Sunday after the body of a missing girl was recovered from the debris at the site, officials said.

The blast occurred on Saturday evening at an under-construction pharmaceutical factory in Kolwade village, with the immediate toll being estimated at eight. However, officials retracted their statements later in the night and said only six bodies had been found.

During debris clearing operations on Sunday morning, the body of Trinath Dasari (40) and a trapped teenager with a faint pulse were found. The girl was identified as Khushi Surendra Yadav, who had been missing since the mishap. “We recovered the body of the missing girl from the debris around 1.30 p.m. She was 13-14 years old,” Superintendent of Police Gaurav Singh said. Khushi was declared dead in the hospital.

The six found dead on Saturday were identified as Iliyas Bashir Ansari (45), Nishu Rahul Singh (26), Mayuri Vashishth Singh (46), Golu Surendra Yadav (19 ), Rajmati Devi Surendra Yadav (40) and Mohan Ingle (45). Khushi was the daughter of Rajmati Devi.

Meanwhile, 24 hours after the incident, authorities said they were unable to point out what had caused the boiler explosion as the key people were dead or injured. The police said the key eyewitnesses Gokul and Deepchandra, who alerted them about the mishap, could not to be found anywhere.

“What exactly happened at the industry is still a question. Eight people died in this blast and seven were injured,” inspector Kishore Jagtap, MIDC police, said, adding that the statement of Sugriva, a carpenter employed at the site, had been recorded.

The owner of the plant, Natwarbhai Patel, was among seven others who were injured in the incident, disaster control cell chief Vivekananda Kadam said. “Work on clearing the debris at the blast site is under way and those injured are undergoing treatment at various hospitals,” Mr. Kadam said.

Mr. Patel, whose stomach was ripped open in the blast was said to be critical. He was first admitted to Thunga Hospital in Boisar but later transferred to Wockhardt Hospital, Umrao, due to the severity of his injuries. Two of the others were discharged later on Sunday. Four continue to be under observation at the ICU at Thunga Hospital.

Around 7 p.m. on Saturday, an explosion was heard from M/s ANK Pharma Pvt Limited (earlier known as Tara Nitrate) during boiler testing at MIDC in Boisar, located over 100 km from Mumbai, officials earlier said.

The blast was so huge that it was heard within a 15-km radius, and window panes of some houses in the surrounding area shattered, they said. The under-construction plant building collapsed after the explosion and two other chemical units located in the vicinity also suffered damages, Mr. Kadam said.

A team of the National Disaster Response Force was also called for rescue operations on Saturday. District Guardian Minister Dada Bhuse inspected the blast site at night. Later talking to reporters, he said as per preliminary reports, the plant had permission from the authorities concerned to carry out testing of machineries.

“However, district health and safety officials will visit the site and carry out an inspection. Based on their report, the police will take further action,” he said.

“In view of several chemical units located in Boisar MIDC, we have to now seriously think of taking steps to prevent such incidents in future,” Mr. Bhuse said.

The minister said he would hold a meeting with all stakeholders in the coming days to come up with some preventive measures.

“We would seek guidance and suggestions from experts in this field. Periodic inspections of these plants will be conducted to come up with safety measures,” Mr. Bhuse said.

Earlier, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced an assistance of ₹5 lakh each for the kin of the deceased.

408,2020/01/13,Marine Drive plays host to veterans march,"Marine Drive on Sunday played host to India’s first tri-service veterans march, an idea that came about three weeks ago, but initially faced apprehension and resistance.

Held in the run-up to Veterans Day on January 14, the march saw participation from retired personnel from the Army, Navy and Air Force. They were joined by 50 members of the National Cadet Corps, 150 of the Sea Cadet Corps and a team of Mumbai Police’s commando unit. Two senior war veterans on wheelchairs and 12 gallantry award winners also participated.

January 14 also marks the day when the first commander-in-chief of Indian Army, Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa, who led the Indian forces to victory in the 1947 War, hung his uniform in 1953.

The march was the brainchild of Commander (retd.) Vijay Vadhera, president, Mumbai chapter, Navy Foundation, which has 1,222 retired naval officers as members.

Three weeks ago, Cdr. Vadhera, who thought of the march after having been witness to one in Melbourne while visiting his daughter, broached the topic with the western naval command headquarters. “It was first met with resistance and apprehension. Many thought time was short and the Navy had more pressing issues at hand. I however convinced them and took charge,” said Cdr. Vadhera, who next found himself spending three-and-a-half-hours waiting to meet the Police Commissioner for permission.

At the end of the meeting, Commissioner Sanjay Barve had not just granted permission but also issued directions to the police commandos and police band to participate. “My wait was satisfying. The Commissioner got up to salute after hearing my concept note. This will become an annual event,” Cdr. Vadhera said.

The march commenced from NCPA up to Princess Street flyover. It was led by Naval/Sea Cadet Corps bands and cheered by cadets holding national flags manning the flanks. Committee members took the lead, followed by the Navy Foundation contingent, Army Veterans contingent and the Air Force Veterans contingent. The police band was in tow.

“The ultimate aim of the parade was to make this auspicious event popular amongst all veterans’ foundations to create awareness amongst our countrymen. In fact, since we had alerted hotels along Marine Drive, a lot of their foreign guests too lined up to cheer us,” Cdr. Vadhera said, promising a better show next year.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/awfdhv/article30553109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMtri-service-march,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/marine-drive-plays-host-to-veterans-march/article30553110.ece

410,2020/01/13,"Deepika’s was an act of stunning courage, let’s celebrate that","Let us give rein to cynicism. Let us assume that Deepika Padukone’s visit to the Jawaharlal Nehru University within 48 hours of the attack on its students was a publicity stunt for a movie she was both acting in and producing.

Even then – follow me closely now – even then, it was an act of stunning courage. She had a great deal to lose. She could have expressed her support from a secure distance or from the safety of the social media. Even ruling party politicians living in Delhi who are former JNU students chose this path.

But there was nothing wishy-washy about Ms. Padukone’s response. Predictably, the bhakts have called for a boycott of her movie. How many actors, how many directors, how many producers, how many musicians can they boycott if Bollywood decides to protest in one voice?

News channels are fond of asking why the Bachchans and the many Khans haven’t spoken up. This happens every time there is a political crisis. What they imply is that with the power of celebrity comes responsibility. I am not so sure this is the case. When Shahrukh Khan or Salman Khan signed up to be actors, commenting on issues of national importance was never a part of the deal. Of course it might make a huge difference if they did speak up, but I have no quarrel if they don’t.

These are personal choices, and if they – like millions – decide that they want to keep out of it, so be it. Compulsions are different, and it is easy to criticise from the outside.

Having said that, however, if they do speak up, as many of their colleagues have done, then our respect for them will increase hugely. Unlike your average accountant or doctor who may not have as much to lose, the bigger the star (in any field), the more vulnerable he or she is. Outspoken filmmaker Anurag Kashyap put it best when asked about this reluctance: “I have crossed my limit of tolerance, maybe others haven’t.”

Judging an act by how much a person has to lose by it is a good way of deciding intent. News anchors who scream about the silence of celebrities have not resigned from their jobs to make a point about the manner in which the media have been compromised, for example.

All of which puts into perspective Deepika Padukone’s awe-inspiring act. Just turning up was enough. It was a gesture of compassion. I have no idea of her politics; for all we know it is like a pair of socks, neither right nor left. Not every act needs to be sieved through politics.

She walked the extra mile – and through some poisonous thickets – and for that she must be celebrated. She has, in recent years, shown herself to be a strong, independent, intelligent woman with empathy and understanding. This is the “Indian” woman our politicians give lip sympathy to but in reality run from.

We live in difficult times. Champions emerge from unexpected places.

411,2020/01/13,Trust in the age of misinformation,"Every year, the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at the University of Oxford publishes a report on the media. This year’s study, Journalism, Media, and Technology: Trends and Predictions 2020, documents the changing contours of the news business and how the industry is coping with the challenges posed by technology. It points out that at a time of economic and political uncertainty, news organisations may have to face more challenges to their sustainability. It says broken business models and platform companies are exacerbating the crisis.

Factors affecting journalism

The study also records a number of factors that are affecting journalism. It deals extensively with the impact of post-truth politics on journalism and has suggestions for news organisations on how to deal with this new reality. The study focusses mainly on the U.K. elections and the narratives surrounding Brexit. The findings are not encouraging: politicians have played with facts, avoided journalistic scrutiny, and succeeded in denigrating the media. The report cites the U.K.’s independent fact-checking organisation, Full Fact, which says that the six-week campaign saw “inappropriate and misleading campaign tactics that we hadn’t seen before”. The devious methods it saw included “an official Conservative Party Twitter account impersonating a fact-checking organisation and editing footage of a Labour politician to make it look as if he couldn’t answer a question about the party’s Brexit policy.”

The report says the reach of misinformation forced many news organisations to integrate fact-checking into their coverage and scrutinise politicians wherever possible. However, these special programmes did not get many views. The report points out that politicians are increasingly trying to bypass the media and convey messages directly via social media. Leaders across the world have become more belligerent than ever before, says the report, and cites the examples of Boris Johnson refusing to giving an interview to journalist Andrew Neil, the regular threats given to review the broadcast licenses handed out to media organisations such as Channel 4, and the funding arrangements for public media like the BBC.

Impact of fact-checking

While 85% of those surveyed said that the media should call out lies and half-truths, readership figures and audience engagement numbers indicate that growing indifference adds a new dilemma to news organisations. What is the impact of fact-checking? There is some indication that rigourous and relentless journalism sometimes leads to disengagement; people simply avoid reading the news. Can journalism effectively engage readers in the light of growing cynicism and negativity? Mary Hockaday, Controller, BBC World Service English, has come up with a possible answer: “We certainly need to offer fact checks and reality checks. But we also need content which explores good faith politics, what might be working, how policy develops and makes a difference. Otherwise we will push our audiences to disengage and distrust politics even more.”

These issues resonate with an Indian news ombudsman because this country is in constant election mode and political leaders here too use digital platforms for propaganda. It is not just Mr. Johnson who has refused to give an interview; Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in his second term and is yet to hold a single press conference. He also reaches his audience through his radio programme ‘Mann Ki Baat’, or Twitter, or soundbites to select news agencies which are not questioned. In a sense, we citizens get a series of monologues from our leaders.

Some of the best fact-check exercises in India happened following the brutal attack on the students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. But they did not deter the peddlers of fake news from regurgitating the same old lies. What can a news organisation do in the present environment?

Journalists should bear in mind what Reuters Fellow Richard Fletcher says about the status of trust. He says the trust factor will get worse before it gets better. Explainers, contextual essays, increased space for data journalism, long-from reportage and analysis of difficult policy decisions are some of the journalistic means to confront the scourge of misinformation. Are these measures enough to stop the erosion of trust?

412,2020/01/13,Dubai Design Week: Top installations and brand picks,"Late last year, the largest creative festival in the Middle East returned for its fifth edition, covering a range of disciplines, including architecture, interior, product design and multimedia. Not only does the festival provide an accessible meeting point for the global design community, but it also acts as a catalyst for the growth of the creative community in Dubai and the UAE.

Key components include the region’s leading design fair, Downtown Design; the Global Grad Show, which brings together projects from 100 of the most innovative universities across the world; Abwab, a curated and interactive project containing original design from the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia; and an extensive programme of talks and workshop that included names like designer Christian Louboutin and editor of online design magazine Dezeen, Marcus Fairs.

Our pick of top installations and brands:

Qissa Ghar by The Busride Design Studio

Abwab’s India pavilion illustrated the country’s pluralistic culture. Designed by Mumbai-based The Busride Design Studio, Qissa Ghar, which translates to ‘Home of Stories’, brought a compelling blend of diverse religions and cultures to create a retelling of age-old creation myths. Seven contemporary artists interpreted these elements on khadi to create moments of connection between the vast network of stories that populate the pavilion.

The Maze by NYXO Visionary Design

The Maze was a dynamic installation that explored the domains of interactive surfaces with a sculptural quality. NYXO created a multi-effect surface of metal-skin for the interface, which was constantly rearranged by visitors — a mechanism allowed rotation around the centre of each modular panel (the plate could be taken out, rotated and re-inserted, transforming the wall into a 3D dynamic puzzle). The use of gleaming metal components highlight the three-dimensional nature of the installation.

Brand picks

Tanween: The professional development programme by Tashkeel is open to emerging designers and artisans in the UAE. Abdalla Almulla, Lana El Samman and Yara Habib produced three limited-edition products — Traces of Time, Mokaعab and Katta — as part of the 2019 design programme. Traces of Time is a timepiece that explores the formation of sand dunes and allows users to experience the natural phenomenon. A built-in timer moves light across the timepiece, gradually illuminating each of the six profiles as the day progresses, using two different colours to represent day and night. Mokaعab spotlights the centuries-old skill of weaving dried palm fronds (khoos). And Katta, a screen-divider with 400 pieces — made with individually hand-woven wooden panels and a variety of materials, including aluminium, corian and faux suede — is inspired by the traditional patterns and crafts of the UAE. Each individual panel rotates and pays special attention to the shapes, symmetry and rhythm found in Al Sadu, an embroidery form by the Bedouin people.

KALO’s Carabus collection: It is the result of conflating concepts of traditional craft with processes of advanced robotic fabrication. The aim is to address issues like tacit material knowledge and craftsmanship through a contemporary lens. Carabus highlights both machine and handcraft using robotically-formed copper as well as camel leather and walnut wood. The forms and textures are loosely inspired by beetles

DesignKraft: Established in 2017 by Sidarth Menon, the company creates design-led furniture, lighting and objects. It was founded as a platform for people to express their individuality through design, by marrying the freedom and creativity of design studios with the capabilities of a full-scale joinery and fabrication facility. They are known for their design-led approach, use of noble materials and taking risks.

416,2020/01/13,Corporation takes parks back,"The town planning committee of the city Corporation has taken back control of some parks and landscaped traffic islands in the city, which were not being properly maintained by private parties contracted for the purpose.

After carrying out maintenance works, the civic body is now looking for organisations and individuals willing to take up the regular upkeep of these parks, as the Corporation does not have enough staff to be used for the same.

The big challenge for the Corporation is in finding organisations that are interested in taking up the parks and traffic islands located in the Kowdiar to East Fort route, where advertisements cannot be displayed. One of the attractions for many who bid for the annual contracts is the display of advertisements on prime land.

“Recently, we took control of the Ayyankali park and carried out maintenance work. But if we don’t have proper upkeep regularly, it does not serve any purpose. We cannot manage all the parks and traffic island landscaping with our current staff strength. Most private parties approach us looking at the possibilities of advertisement. But, on the Kowdiar-East Fort route, they are only allowed to put up a board with the name of the institution maintaining it. Only institutions like banks approach us,” says Town Planning Standing Committee Chairman Palayam Rajan.

The State Bank of India had recently carried out maintenance work at the park inside the Poojappura junction traffic island. The Corporation had also carried out renovation work at Kowdiar park and is now looking for organisations interested in running it. Other parks for which the Corporation is looking for contractors include the park at Vettamukku, the children’s park near Cliff House, and the Mannanthala traffic island.

Encroachments

The town planning standing committee has also decided to remove encroachments into roads and footpaths by shops within this month.

417,2020/01/13,City to get more water by summer 2020; work progressing fast on 75 mld plant,"City residents can expect a significant addition to water supply by the middle of summer 2020 with work progressing at a swift pace in Aruvikkara on the new 75 mld (million litres a day) treatment plant. The facility, in addition to augmenting piped supply, would also serve as emergency backup.

Civil works related to the Rs 60-crore project are almost over. Mechanical works have kicked off, senior Kerala Water Authority (KWA) officials said. ''We are aiming to commission the project by March 31 as planned. The additional supply will be more than enough to cater to city requirements in the coming years,'' said Suresh Chandran, KWA Superintending Engineer, PH Circle Thiruvananthapuram. The work is being carried out by Kochi-based Chicago Constructions International Pvt Ltd.

Getting ready under the centrally-sponsored Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), the 75 mld facility will complement the existing 72 mld, 86 mld and the 74 mld water treatment facilities in Aruvikkara. Its operations are being designed in a manner that all the main KWA tanks in the city would get a share of the additional supply.

Technology-wise, the new plant will be a step forward, KWA officials said. For the pumping of raw water from the reservoir, it will use two 710 HP centrifugal pumps, one of which will be of the submersible type. The advantage of the latter is that it will enable pumping even when reservoir levels are low. As part of the AMRUT project, the KWA also aims to install a 735 HP submersible pump in the raw water tank of the 72 mld plant which will act as stand-by for emergencies.

Further, the 75 mld plant will employ a more advanced technology for treating water collected from the reservoir. Unlike the 72 and 86 mld plants that use conventional treatment systems and the 74 mld facility which employs a pulsator clarifier, the 75 mld plant will be equipped with a lamella clarifier (inclined plate settler) for removing particulates from raw water. This reduces cost, the space required and produces clearer water. The clear-water facility of the plant will be equipped with four 430 HP pumps, two of which will be kept on stand-by.

From Aruvikkara, water will be pumped to the KWA tanks at PTP Nagar and Peroorkada for citywide distribution. Additionally, the 75 mld plant will also enable the KWA to top up, whenever required, another tank in Aruvikkara built under the JICA-assisted 74 mld project.

The 75 mld facility was proposed to meet the rising water demands of an expanding city which already consumes 270-280 mld. The plant is one of two important initiatives from the KWA stable to ensure water security in the long term. A bigger project - the 120 mld treatment plant in Neyyar - is expected to be completed by March 2021. The city stands to get 100 mld additionally from this project. The remaining 20 mld would be shared by four panchayats in the Neyyar region.

Earlier this month, the State Government had given the KWA the go-ahead for desilting the entire Aruvikkara reservoir. Desiltation would restore reservoir capacity, thereby aiding various water supply augmentation projects envisaged for Thiruvananthapuram, the Water Resources Department has noted.

419,2020/01/13,Micro compost yard becomes operational in Thanjavur,"A micro compost yard (MCY), one of the components of the multi-purpose centre (MPC) planned under the Smart City project, has been commissioned at Jabamalaipuram here recently.

According to official sources, Thanjavur Corporation has mooted a proposal to set up multi-purpose centres at 14 places in the town under the Smart City project at a total outlay of ₹10.50 crore.

Under the proposal, each MPC will house an office for the sanitary inspector, rooms for sanitary workers, birth and death registration counters along with the micro compost yard (MCY) for waste segregation and bio-manure production.

However, there has been stiff opposition to the plan from residents of certain wards in the town, with Corporation officials forced to retreat from site visits for preliminary works.

On an average, 110 to 115 metric tonnes of garbage is being generated in Thanjavur daily and dumped at the 21-acre Chekkadi compost yard on the western outskirts of the town.

However, the quantum of garbage collected and transported to the compost yard has declined a little after the civic body vigorously promoted the concept of segregation of garbage at source as bio-degradable and non-biodegradable wastes.

The officials expect the total quantum of garbage handled daily by the civic body to come down considerably once the MPCs become functional. At Jabamalaipuram, the MCY has been set up with a capacity to handle five tonnes of garbage daily, but it receives and processes around 2.5 to 3 tonnes of garbage a day from Wards 18 and 19.

“This is due to segregation of waste at source and as well as separation of non-biodegradable waste from the garbage by the field workers to some extent. The non-biodegradable wastes that finds their way into the MCY are segregated by the workers at the centre”, they pointed out.

In addition to generation of bio-manure, shredding of plastics and incineration of sanitary napkins have also been carried out at the MCY, sources said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/micro-compost-yard-becomes-operational-in-thanjavur/article30559637.ece

427,2020/01/13,Train passengers at their wits’ end,"Passengers bound to their homes for Sankranti festival are facing inconvenience as almost all the seats in trains have been booked. With no tickets available in the majority of the buses, the passengers are forced to choose alternative means such as taxis and cabs which are charging exorbitant fare.

Trains become the first preference for the passengers in view of safety, reliability and economy. A good number of people from north Andhra districts have settled down in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai, apart from other States.

Almost all trains coming from these places are full for a week before and after the festival.

Passengers rue that though it is a recurring feature every year, the authorities are not operating sufficient number of trains to meet the demand. The weekly specials to Tirupati and Secunderabad have, however, been extended to partially. An excess fare of ₹100 to ₹150 is being charged for the special trains.

Around 1,000 youths from various colleges and schools participated in the procession that covered Seven Hills Hospital Junction, Green Park Hotel Junction, Pandimetta Road, Novotel Hotel and RK Beach before culminating at the the Mission Ashrama.

The participants raised slogans such as “Arise awake and stop not till the goal is reached”, “Strength is life- Weakness is death” and “You are creator of your own destiny” .

Speaking on the occasion, Andhra University former Rector A. Prasanna Kumar recalled the reply of Swami Vivekananda to the question of a journalist when he returned India after delivering his ‘Chicago speech’.

Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) Deputy Chairman P.L. Harinadh said the need of the hour is to follow the teachings of Swami Vivekananda.

National teacher awardee and former Principal of Ramnath Secondary School, NSTL, C.V. Narasimham advised the students to aim big in life.

Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama secretary Swami Atmavidananda, Indian skater and Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar Awardee Priyam Tated, World Karate Champion B. Anmish Varma, organic farmer C. Ganesh, CMD of SRK Infra M. Satyanarayana Raju were present.

Yoga Bharati Trust and Jana Jagarana Samithi (JJS) jointly organised an essay-writing competition on the life of Swami Vivekananda. As many as 53,468 students participated in contest. Sabbavarapu Jyothsna of Sri Chaitanya Techno School at Kommadi won the first prize of ₹1 lakh. The prize was handed over to her by APPGCET convener P.S. Avadhani.

JJS State convener Vasu said it was unfortunate that instead of promoting ‘man-making education’ as envisioned by Swami Vivekananda, both the Telugu States were encouraging ‘money-making education’. He called upon youths and students to strive for the alleviation of poverty to realise the dream of Swami Vivekananda. Director of AP Pharmacy Council D. Prasada Reddy spoke.

Exhibition

At Sri Prakash Vidyaniketan, Ramakrishna Mission secretary Swami Guneshananda participated in the celebrations. He unveiled an exhibition of Swami Vivekananda’s portraits drawn by the students on leaves. The students also presented a play on Swami Vivekananda. Prizes were given away to the winners of various competitions.

430,2020/01/13,Survey date for reservation of wards extended,"The last date for the door-to-door survey to finalise the reservation of wards in the corporation limits has been extended by three days, GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana said.

In a release, Ms Srijana urged the SC, ST, women and BC voters to cooperate with survey teams in view of change in schedule.

As per the original schedule, the survey is supposed to identify SC, ST, BC and women voters within the GVMC limits between January 11 and 16.

Special teams have been appointed for each polling station. However, the State Election Commission and the municipal administration have extended the last date for the survey to January 19 as the supplementary data pertaining to the voters’ list is yet to be received from some districts.

According to the revised schedule, the draft on the voters’ list will be published on January 21.

431,2020/01/13,More time sought for inclusion of names in electoral roll,"Former bureaucrat E.A.S. Sarma has urged the State Election Commission (SEC) to give a wide publicity to voters’ list and ward-wise delimitation.

The SEC should give sufficient time for suggestions and objections if any, he said.

In a representation on the local body elections submitted to State Election Commissioner Ramesh Kumar, Mr. Sarma said that a wide publicity should be given to enable the voters to verify the electoral rolls and make sure that their names are included. They should be provided with ample time to complete the formalities in case their names are missing in the electoral roll.

“Large-scale exclusion of voters from the electoral process will reflect poorly on the electoral system,” he said.

Mr. Sarma sought the municipal bodies to publish the draft for ward-wise delimitation for eliciting views and objections if any. “The time given is too limited to enable voters to analyse and respond,” said Mr. Sarma.

432,2020/01/13,"Airlines, bus operators rake in the moolah ahead of Sankranti","Airlines and private bus operators have jacked up the ticket prices, cashing in on the huge passenger rush for Sankranti. Travel companies have increased the fare by three to four times.

Flight tickets from Visakhapatnam to Vijayawada are now more than that to Hyderabad. Usually, a flight ticket from Visakhapatnam to Vijayawada does not cost more than ₹2,500. But the prices have gone up three times. The minimum flight ticket fare for the journey from Visakhapatnam to Vijayawada on January 14, a day before Sankranti, is around ₹6,600.

Similarly, flight tickets from Visakhapatnam to Hyderabad or vice-versa is now available in the range of ₹3,500 and ₹4,600. The same for Bengaluru-bound flights is around ₹5,000.

“The airlines are doing this ahead of every festive season. We saw the same trend during the Dasara holidays a few months ago. It is time the authorities concerned intervened. The airlines can not keep increasing ticket prices as per their whims and fancies. There should be a gross maximum price,” says Tours and Travels Association of Andhra Pradesh president K. Vijaya Mohan.

Private bus operators have increased the fares. Several sleeper buses are now charging ₹2,700 for a ticket from Visakhapatnam to Vijayawada, while the fare for AC sleeper buses has touched ₹4,700. A multi-axle semi-sleeper bus travel is costing between ₹1,600 and ₹2,500.

The transport officials have launched a special drive against the bus operators charging exorbitant fare. The officials have registered cases against 119 bus operators during raids by January 10. As many as 65 buses have been seized.

“The raids will continue till January 25. Passengers can bring to our notice if any private bus operators are fleecing passengers,” says Deputy Transport Commissioner (Visakhapatnam) G.

434,2020/01/13,Data | What made the Australian bushfires so severe this season?,"Australia is facing one of its worst bushfire seasons in history, which has caused the deaths of at least 24 people and more than one billion animals (an estimate by The University of Sydney) as on January 8. Though bushfires are common in the country, the current spell has witnessed more than 80,000 fires, a scale not seen in at least two decades. The 2019 fires have come as a double whammy to a nation already reeling under the hottest and driest-ever conditions in 100 years.

Searing heat

In 2019, Australia was 1.52°C warmer than the average temperature between 1961 and 1990, the hottest year on record since 1900. December 2019 was accompanied by record-breaking heat across the country with maximum temperatures soaring to 41.9C. The country's six hottest days on record were all in December 2019.

Such levels of heat caused the “fuel load” (amount of fallen bark, leaf litter and small branches) to catch fire or continue to burn.

Record temperatures

The temperature change has been on the rise for the past five years (2015 to 2019), a phenomenon never seen since 1900 In December 18, 2019, the average temperature reached a record high of 41.9 0 C

Bone dry

In 2019, Australia received its lowest-ever rainfall. It also recorded the biggest annual drop in rainfall (187.56 mm lower than the 1961-1990 average). Low relative humidity causes fuel load to dry up more easily and become more flammable.

Extreme blaze

The record-breaking heat accompanied by extreme drought has resulted in the bushfires spiralling out of control, especially in New South Wales, which is battling its worst fire season in at least 20 years.

435,2020/01/13,Art is as important as other subjects...,"“Art has a key role in nurturing a non-violent and humane society,” said Blaise Joseph, artist and programme director of Art by Children, Kochi Binnale Foundation, who was in the city recently. Along with Sara Vetteth, the founder of Rainbow fish Studio and Indian Art and Design Educators Association (IADEA), he conducted a workshop for art educators at Meraki Makerspace. Blaise also described art as “a language” and “the basics of education”.

Sara stressed the importance of training art teachers, “as they are the people who help children to find their voices.” She also pointed out that art could be viewed through multiple perspectives. She has been art educator in the US and, when she came back to India, “started a project called RainbowFish Studio to help children see art as a means to express their unique way of seeing the world.” Through this, she met many art teachers and was inspired to begin IADEA “to train and help them collaborate with other artists, organisations and museums.”

Both Blaise and Sara pointed out that many schools and parents do not give importance to art. “Most want to draw a pretty picture and do not give importance to innovation or self-expression,” she rued but said this can be changed by making sure art is given as much importance as other subjects.” Blaise added that each classroom should be a safe space where a child can work without the fear of being judged. “I am also against art competitions. How can someone rank art? The judge’s perception may be different from that of its creator.”

The duo shared tips on teaching art with 25 participants. “Getting children to be at ease in art class is important. One can start the session with a little game. It is also important to make art personal. Let them do what they want, not what the teacher want,” said Sara. Collaborating with teachers is a way of including art in other subjects. “When a group was learning the periodic table, thanks to the collaboration between the chemistry and art teachers, the students were asked to learn the properties of an element and draw it as a person,” Sara recalled.

Blaise also focused attention to the lack of open spaces in the city. “These are the best place to learn art. The time they spend with Nature improves their observation. They should be given spaces of different sizes. First paper, chart, cardboard and, later, walls. Always remember that it is the process, not the end result, that is important. Encourage them to think and come up with their own ideas.”

The duo say that, in the recent past, there has been more awareness on art and its importance. “Now the CBSE also requires integration of art into other subjects. I hope there will be more such changes in the future,” said Sara.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/j9l6nz/article30555628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WORKSHOP-31,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/on-the-recent-workshop-for-art-educators-by-sara-vetteth-and-blaise-joseph-at-coimbatore/article30555630.ece
436,2020/01/13,A dose of daily fun,"The grounds of Lil’ Pallikkoodam on Avinashi Road are buzzing with chatter and laughter as parents and children carrying tyres, plastic bottles, utensils, cardboard boxes, coconut shells and other strange items enter the gates. Everyone is gathering for the Loose Parts Play event organised by the school as part of Coimbatore Vizha.

“Loose Parts are items that can easily be found around each house,” says Swetha Krishnamurthy, the school’s founder. “At this event, these things will be used to make toys. When children create something with items that they see around them, it improves their creativity.”

The Loose Parts Play, she explains is part of an effort to raise awareness on the importance of reducing screen time. Both fine motor skills and attention spans are affected by too much time spent on electronic gadgets.

Three-year-old Vidyuth is busy painting a cardboard piece for a castle. His mother, Abinaya Vishu, discloses that the structure will have a tunnel that leads to a dinosaur park. “We will add bridges made with popsicle sticks in the park and also decorate it with plants and pebbles.”

At another area, a cardboard box is being re-purposed into an aircraft and Mahakrithi A, Nila Rahul and Mayuran A are painting the wings to attach it to the body. “We love doing this and we will play with it once we take it home,” says Nila.

Heian and his brother Shivan are making an airport. “I am just back from a holiday at Nagpur. I loved the airport and so made it my theme. I made the planes with thermocol and wood and the runway will be made of black chart paper,” Shivan explains.

A Christmas-themed project by seven parents is complete with a Christmas tree, an igloo and a snow man. “Look inside the igloo,” one parents tells me. When I do, I find four kids giggling inside and playing with their toys.

Aizha’s cardboard kitchen is fully equipped with a stove, vessels, oven and a fridge made of cardboard and paper. “I love cooking. Do you want an omelette?” she asks.

Her mother Sana Syed says that they undertake weekly projects where they make toys with stuff around the house. “I bring different themes for each weekend. She loves it and I think it has made her creative. Now she will play with this kitchen set at home,” she says.

There is a sudden burst of music as Dhrihika and Rohit test their instruments made from empty kitchen vessels. Painted plastic pipes form a xylophone and old bells have been hung around the place a frame. “Dhrihika is my only child and she uses gadgets at home when she gets bored.

437,2020/01/13,WHO calls for vigilance on Wuhan virus,"The World Health Organisation (WHO) has cautioned that though there is no evidence currently of human-to-human transmission of the Wuhan pneumonia that has killed one person in China and infected 40 others, there is a “need to remain vigilant.”

Speaking to The Hindu, Poonam Khetrapal, regional director, of WHO (South-East Asia) said on Monday, “We have shared technical guidelines on surveillance, testing as well as infection prevention and control practices for suspected cases.”

Ready to intervene

She added that the world body is in close contact with national authorities in the region and will extend all possible support to ensure core capacities are geared up for addressing potential cases that may come to countries.

Senior Health Ministry officials added that they were keeping a “close watch on the developments but so far the outbreak has been reported in a single seafood market in the central city of Wuhan and has not, so far, spread beyond there. We have been told that the virus is the same family that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).”

Contained outbreak

The WHO also maintained that the outbreak had not spread and that the seafood market in Wuhan — a major domestic and international transport hub — is now closed and no cases have been reported elsewhere in China or internationally.

“WHO stands ready to provide all possible technical support to countries to ensure core capacities are geared up and have advises against travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available on this event,” added Dr. Khetrapal.

WHO has noted that the Chinese authorities have made a preliminary determination of a novel (or new) coronavirus, identified in a hospitalised person with pneumonia in Wuhan. Chinese investigators conducted gene sequencing of the virus, using an isolate from one positive patient sample.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses and according to Chinese authorities, the virus in question can cause severe illness in some patients but does not transmit readily between people.

“In the coming weeks, more comprehensive information is required to understand the current status and epidemiology of the outbreak, and the clinical picture. Further investigations are also required to determine the source, modes of transmission, extent of infection and countermeasures implemented. WHO continues to monitor the situation closely and, together with its partners, is ready to provide technical support to China to investigate and respond to this outbreak,” the organisation added.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/j9aiqw/article30559644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-WHO1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/who-calls-for-vigilance-on-wuhan-virus/article30559645.ece
438,2020/01/13,"Exposure to lead can be a risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease, says ICMR-NIN","Lead is a common pollutant that can get into the environment from a number of commonly used materials like paints, cosmetics, batteries, glass and low-grade toys. Its role as a risk factor in the development of neuro-degenerative diseases has been established globally. Environmental exposure to this toxic heavy metal is associated with many patho-physiological dysfunctions of the central nervous system, and now, recent lab-based studies conducted at Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Nutrition (ICMR-NIN) have established a possible link between lead exposure and Alzheimer’s disease.

Molecular mechanism

The release issued by ICMR notes that senior scientist Suresh Challa looked into the molecular mechanism behind both lead and beta amyloid peptide induced toxicity by investigating the molecular mechanism involved in the development of lead induced Alzheimer’s disease through in vitro studies.

“In fact, Alzheimer’s disease has a complex patho-physiology which involves initially the formation of beta amyloid plaques and tangles in the brain. In addition, oxidative stress and inflammation are known to be involved in the progression of the disease, with loss of memory and neuronal cell death. In this scenario, our study investigated the basic molecular mechanism behind the involvement of lead in Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr. Challa

Developing strategies

“Maternal exposure to lead during pregnancy can cause developmental reprogramming which can lead to higher risk and early onset of Alzheimer’s disease in later life. Since lead exposure is an important public health concern, the current findings could be another piece in solving the puzzle towards understanding the intracellular mechanism of Alzheimer’s disease. Such findings may as well help in developing strategies for prevention and management of Alzheimer’s disease in the elderly,” said R.

439,2020/01/13,Would the Mediterranean diet work for you?,"Happening:

Nuts, cheese, fruit, fish... as far as diets go, the one followed in Mediterranean countries in the 1960s was definitely attractive. What we term the Mediterranean Diet today was followed matter-of-factly by the inhabitants of Greece, Italy, Spain and other countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea for years. There are a number of reasons to assume its effectiveness. The World Health Organization talks of its benefits in Europe’s new Health Evidence Network Synthesis Report, saying it protects against cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. But then it also says the same about The New Nordic diet, and also credited other Mediterranean habits — like shared eating practices, afternoon naps and lengthy mealtimes — for the health of people in the region.

In everyday terms, the appeal of this diet is clear: it relies heavily on the local and seasonal, which are buzzwords in the world of food today. Morevoer, unlike some other diets, this one offers its followers plenty of choice. The main foundation of the Mediterranean diet is a daily consumption of fresh vegetables, fruits, lentils, herbs, nuts and whole, unrefined grains. Besides these, there is also a strong emphasis on fish (had weekly) and other sources of healthy fat like olive oil.

The diet also allows for the consumption of dairy (particularly yoghurt and unprocessed varieties of cheese), poultry, and eggs. Red meat, however, is avoided or had only occasionally, as are foods rich in sugar.

Medical research backs the diet too. From 1984 to 2004, a study funded and supported by the US-based National Institutes of Health (NIH) looked at the diet and health of 74,886 women aged between 38 and 63 years. The researchers were mainly looking for incidences of fatal and non-fatal stroke, and coronary heart disease (CHD), and computed their Alternate Mediterranean Diet Scores from data submitted by the women themselves. They concluded that “A greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women.”

Bengaluru-based dietician Sheela Krishnaswamy sees a couple of minor chinks in the diet, but finds it well-balanced on the whole. “It includes a lot of fish and nuts, so if you are allergic to either, you should avoid it. For vegetarians also, it might not work very well,” she says, because of the emphasis on fish as a protein source, but also acknowledges that the diet itself offers a solution of sorts.

“Lentils are a part of the Mediterranean diet, but not recommended on a daily basis. Vegetarians who follow it, however, will need to have lentils daily for the protein intake, along with whole grains, fruit and vegetables,” she explains. Having said that, however, she does laud the diet for covering all the nutrients a human body needs. “There is also enough fibre in the diet to ensure that one does not overeat,” she adds.

440,2020/01/13,CAA/NRC unrest making you anxious? Here’s what therapists have to say,"Say no to hopelessness, take back power

As a therapist, what worries me is how much hopelessness I see, says Srividya Rajaram. That ‘nothing I do will change anything; things will remain the same.’ Take into account the best that you can do at your personal level. You are part of the demographic that has a voice in the country’s matters and governance, so do not forget that. Even if you can’t bring immediate largescale change, you are generating questions in people’s minds. Which means your actions are not happening in a vacuum.

Ask for help

Many therapists and peer support groups have offered voluntary therapy. Some are even conducting support group workshops. On December 16, after the violence in Jamia Millia Islamia University, Delhi-based mental health activist, Anna, part of Queer Affirmative Counselling Practice group, created a list of therapists who would offer free therapy to those affected. “We felt very disturbed by the whole thing. We couldn’t just watch, we wanted to be involved and contribute in our way. What the students of Jamia, AMU and JNU faced must have left them with massive trauma. So we created a list of people from our group: whoever had the time and ability to volunteer. Eventually, therapists from other cities started connecting with us, saying they would also like to be part of it.” Follow @annaverbee on Twitter, or @shimmiedandstomped on Instagram for the list.

Acknowledge that help comes in different forms

If attending a protest is going to upset you to a point that you are physically sick from anxiety, find other ways to contribute. Maybe you can disseminate information on social media, do fact checks, make posters, or donate to certain groups, or if you are a lawyer, do pro-bono work.

Give credit for all work done

Acknowledge all work done, including your own; everything counts. Skip the judgement, which only makes us fatigued.

Find anchors for hope

Even when 99% of a situation looks bad, look at the 1% that gives you happiness. Maybe it is looking at how the elderly, babies, celebrities, everyone is pitching in. Think about the effort that they are putting in.

Laughter is the best medicine

The interesting posters and artwork that we saw at the protests and online are signs that while one may be upset and angry at what is going on, one is also able to be creative and humorous. Bringing humour to a tragedy makes it more human.

Talk to your support systems

Seek support in different places, if you feel like you don’t find it in your traditional support systems. When it comes to a close family member that has opposing views, recognise that they are not just the sum total of their opinions on a particular matter. Understand their background, their reasoning, but also recognise when you need to keep your distance.

Engage with your feelings

There is bound to be apathy, anxiety and anger among whoever is informed enough about what’s going on. To deal with it would be to engage with your feelings, use them to understand that this is not just about what is happening around you, but how you feel out there. Recognise that any struggle that one participates in will lead to struggle within.

Have pockets of normalcy without feeling guilt

It is important to stay grounded and take time off throughout the day, to have pockets of normalcy, without feeling guilty about it. Recognise that every battle is not ours, and every battle is not for today. This needs all of us to be able to sustain ourselves — it is not a race but a marathon. So we have to allow space for ourselves to breathe, and be kind to ourselves.

441,2020/01/13,Why we must keep the anxiety alive,"There is, about us, widespread mistrust, violence, long-buried hatred that has surfaced and bubbled up like yeast, fermenting almost anything it touches.

I look at my neighbours and wonder what they feel about me: Are they hoping to throw me out of the country? Or hoping I will leave of my own accord, going away quietly? The doubts stay with me as I watch students struggle against suppression. Will I have their fight, their resilience? Will I have to prove my Indian-ness? Will I have to scream that my father served in the Indian Army as a mob attacks? Or stand up just a tad earlier than the others to sing the national anthem? Is my identity reduced to my religion?

The threats produce fear and anxiety, the adrenaline upsetting the body clock and preventing sleep, the mind’s deepest worries spiralling out of control to think of the worst. There’s a feeling of being overwhelmed, like nothing will be okay again. Now imagine this going viral, it ‘catching’ people all over the country, much like the sense of injustice has galvanised us into just showing up, if not anything else.

The Lancet recently published a study that indicates the unrest in Hong Kong could be affecting the mental health of adults. “...The prevalence of probable depression (in Hong Kong residents aged 18 years or more) was five times higher during the 2019 social unrest than the general population norm before the 2014 Occupy Central Movement (11% vs 2%); whilst post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms were estimated to be six times higher (rising from around 5% shortly after Occupy Central in March 2015 to almost 32% in Sept-Nov, 2019),” it said.

Prolonged anxiety is a bad thing, psychologists tell us. Yet, it is anxiety that is keeping our collective protests going — to protests, to social media that gives us a voice, to speak out in our families who may not agree that what’s happening is wrong. So let the anxiety disrupt sleep, let the uncertainty of police detaining us, of a lathi charge, of tear gas, remain. In this case, our collective anxiety over our future is a must — so we act, so we don’t forget as we go about our daily chores, so we participate.

Meanwhile, the weather in Delhi is colder than ever before this year. There are fewer flowers in the city — or maybe we’re just not noticing them — and on New Year’s Eve, Delhi was almost sober on the roads — one of the few health gains.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/30b3rh/article30556663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-822352820,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/why-we-must-keep-the-anxiety-alive/article30556664.ece
442,2020/01/13,"FIH Hockey Pro League: Chinglensana back in Indian team, Varun misses out","Experienced Chinglensana Singh returned to the Indian team after almost a year while youngster Sumit too made the cut for the 20-member Indian men’s hockey team that will take on World No. 3 the Netherlands in the FIH Hockey Pro League 2020 season-opener later this week.

India will play the first of its four home fixtures of the competition on January 18 and 19 in Bhubaneswar.

While Chinglensana suffered an ankle fracture during the final of the ninth National Championships in February last year in February — he led Railways to a title triumph — Sumit had suffered a wrist injury during the FIH Men’s Series Finals in June 2019, which India won.

“We have chosen a relatively experienced team.

“While Varun will be back in training this week, he wasn’t considered for selection. Chinglensana and Sumit, coming back from long injury lay-offs, have been training well and are physically fit,” chief coach Graham Reid said.

“It will be important to start strong and sharp in the Pro League with our first three ties being against the top-three teams in the world.

“We will be focussing on getting our structures right as preparation for our Olympic campaign,” added reid.

Gurjant too returns

Also coming back after a long hiatus was striker Gurjant Singh, who was part of the 2016 junior World Cup side but failed to cement his place in the senior side, after impressing the team management during the national camps.

However, defender and drag-flicker Varun Kumar failed to get back to full fitness after suffering a nerve injury during the Olympic Qualifiers in November last.

India last played Netherlands in the quarterfinals of the 2018 World Cup, losing 1-2 to the eventual runners-up. India would take on Belgium (February 8-9) and Australia (February 21-22) before leaving for its away fixtures.

The squad:

Goalkeepers: P.R. Sreejesh, Krishan Pathak.

Defenders: Harmanpreet Singh, Gurinder Singh, Amit Rohidas, Surender Kumar, Birendra Lakra, Rupinderpal Singh.

Midfielders: Manpreet Singh, Vivek Sagar Prasad, Chinglensana Singh, Nilakanta Sharma, Sumit.

Forwards: Gurjant Singh, S.V.
