1,2020/01/09,Joshi gains from Harsha’s blunder,"Grandmasters and International Masters had a mixed day with some of them being stretched more than expected by far lesser-rated first-round rivals. Overall, a few surprises were thrown in as the Delhi International Open Grandmasters chess tournament got off on a chilly afternoon here on Thursday.

After Iran’s Pouya Idani missed his flight from Tehran and brought down the number of Grandmasters to 37, not all of these could win as expected. The decision to adopt ‘accelerated pairings’ to the first three rounds also meant higher-ranked players faced higher rated players than what they would have played under normal pairings.

Poor decision

GM Harsha Bharathakoti was the only GM to lose. Local veteran G.B. Joshi benefited from Harsha’s poorly-calculated knight-sacrifice on the 30th move. Soon, Harsha realised he could not get sufficient compensation and resigned three moves later.

S. Dhananjay, rated 2144, held seventh-seeded Uzbek GM Nodirbek Yakubboev, rated 2597, in 48 moves. In fact, it was Dhananjay who pressed for victory after advancing a protected-pawn to the sixth rank but Yakubboev defended accurately.

Peace offering

Chilean GM Rodrigo Vasquez Schroeder (2487) sensed that his rival Aashna Makhija (2068) was unwell and chose to offer a draw in a dominating position after 45 moves.

Former Commonwealth champion P. Karthikeyan was another GM who could only get a draw, after facing Sidhant Gaikwad.

Atul Dahale (2025) stunned Tajikstan’s IM Muhammad Husenkhojaev, rated 2420.

Leading first-round results (Indians unless stated): Anish Gandhi lost to Farrukh Amonatov (Tjk), Pavel Ponkratov (Rus) bt Manish Kumar; Vinayak Kulkarni lost to M. Karthikeyan; Jose Eduardo Martinez Alcantara (Per) bt Harshal Shahi; Karthik Thirsh lost to Abhijeet Gupta; Levan Pantsulaia (Geo) bt Soham Datar; Kiran Manisha Mohanty lost to Aleksey Goganov (Rus); Rodrigo Vasquez Schroeder (Chi) drew with Aashna Makhija; Nguyen Van Huy (Vie) drew with Vedant Pimpalkhare; Atul Dahale bt Muhammad Khusenkhojaev (Tjk); P. Karthikeyan drew with Siddhant Gaikwad; Sammed Shete drew with Akila Kavinda (Sri); Mohed Ameir (Egy) drew with Bhagyashree Patil; Ketan Khaire bt Akash Thakur; Niladri Bhattacharya drew with N.

2,2020/01/09,Are Indian women surfers ready to conquer the ocean?,"There is no place Vilassini Sundar likes better than the ocean. Once, when the 23-year-old international-level surfer from Chennai was dragging herself and her board out of the waters in Kovalam, a couple of her friends — local fishermen-turned-surfers — nearby joked, “You should bring some of your girl friends along! It would be more fun.”

She sure wishes she could, but the truth is, the number of significant competitive women surfers in India can be counted on one’s fingers.

As we look forward to witness, for the very first time, surfing as part of the Olympic Games in Tokyo this year, Indian surfers are playing catch up with the rest of the world. The surfing revolution in Kovalam, spearheaded by former fisherman Murthy Megavan, has given India some of its finest surfers. Murthy is confident that by Olympics 2024, he will have trained his students well enough to represent the country.

But when it comes to Indian women, the story is different. Most are still stuck at the first obstacle — stepping into the waters.

All on board?

The thriving surfing cultures in Tamil Nadu (Chennai), Puducherry and Karnataka (Mangaluru and Udupi) in particular have produced sportswomen who have gone on to participate and win in national and international competitions such as the Asian Surfing Championships, the Indian Open of Surfing and the Covelong Surf Festival. In fact, Manipal is home to India’s first woman surfer, Ishita Malaviya.

“But if you look at the competitions, for every 250 men, there are 30 women,” says Vilassini. When Auroville-based Suhasini Damian, 28, first took part in a competition back in 2014, the organisers initially were not sure if there were enough girls to make for a separate category. “It made me realise that there were very few girls surfing in India. This motivated me to spread awareness and encourage other girls to embrace this lifestyle and sport,” says Suhasini.

At the Kallialay Surf School, near Puducherry, where she trained, Suhasini was the only girl competing. The story is much the same for Vilassini. The reason, she believes, is that most families frown upon women being out in the water.

“They worry that their daughters’ skin will get tanned in the sun, or the salty water will damage the hair. The girl will then not be ‘marriageable’,” she says. Incidentally, Anusha Swamy is smashing those myths — she is a model who surfs regularly.

Then there is the issue of male gaze — wetsuits are form-hugging. Mangaluru-based Sinchana D Gowda has trained herself to ignore this in the past six years. “But you also need to speak out. There have been times men have tried making videos of me while surfing, but not in a good way… They would comment and post these videos with bad captions. So then I talked to the club members and got them to stop,” says the 18-year-old.

Despite obstacles like these, women are choosing to go into the ocean: “I love the freedom I get in the water. I feel like I can be myself, and constantly expect the unexpected,” says Suhasini. This love for the ocean is rare — most city girls are taught to fear it, points out Shrishti Selvam, 22, from Adyar. “That’s the reason the boys from Kovalam are so good at what they do. They were brought up with a love for the ocean, they understand it.”

Nobody understands the importance of this more than Shrishti’s teacher, Murthy. Having successfully trained many fishermen in surfing, he has been actively trying to get more girls from the fishing village into the scene. “I haven’t had much success so far. Families don’t want their daughters out in the ocean. But there is an eight-year-old girl, Monashree, who skateboards and is now learning surfing too,” he says.

One of the boys

Being one of the few women in a scene full of men helps sharpen their competitive edge, according to Vilassini. She says, “You constantly compare yourself with the men and hold yourself to their standards. They too, expect us to perform as well as them and keep pushing us to do better.”

Though she is comfortable with her fellow male surfers, she agrees that sometimes it can be demotivating. Other times, especially while rehearsing at the games, “men dominate in the water, and you have to fight to catch a wave for yourself.”

But for Shrishti, who has just started competing, having seniors like Vilassini and Ishita has made all the difference. “You have someone to look up to. If they can do it, so can you.”

This group of women supporting each other will only increase with the next generation, believes Vilassini. And much of it is thanks to the men: “I have so many young fishermen friends, in their late twenties and thirties, who say that if they ever have a daughter, they will definitely teach her surfing,” she says. Already they are challenging her, albeit in good humour: “You Chennai girls are coming to our village and taking our trophy. But be warned, our village girls will soon outshine you.”

And Vilassini can’t wait for that day.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mzv4kl/article30523577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPSuhasini2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/2020-olympics-indian-women-surfers-ready-to-conquer-the-ocean/article30523579.ece
3,2020/01/09,"Saina, Sindhu enter quarterfinals of Malaysia Masters quarterfinals","Saina Nehwal and reigning world champion P.V. Sindhu produced dominating performances to progress to the women’s singles quarterfinals of the Malaysia Masters Super 500 badminton tournament here on Thursday.

Sixth seed Sindhu notched up a commanding 21-10 21-15 victory over Japan’s Aya Ohori in a pre-quarterfinal match lasting just 34 minutes. It was Sindhu’s ninth successive win over Ohori.

The 24-year-old Indian, who won the World Championships in Basel last year, will take on either world number 1 Chinese Taipei’s Tai Tzu Ying or seventh seed South Korean Sung Ji Hyun in the quarterfinals.

Saina, who had won the Indonesia Masters last year before going through a rough patch, dispatched South Korea’s An Se Young 25-23 21-12 after a thrilling 39-minute contest to make the last eight.

This is Saina’s first win over the South Korean, who got the better of the Indian in the quarterfinals of the French Open last year.

The two-time Commonwealth Games champion will next take on Olympic champion Carolina Marin.

Saina had defeated Lianne Tan of Belgium 21-15 21-17 in the opening round on Wednesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump on January 8 backed away from days of angry rhetoric against Iran as the two countries tried to defuse a crisis over the American killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.

Industrial workers, bank employees and students went on a strike on Wednesday in parts of the country against what they termed the anti-labour policies of the government as well as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Ten central trade unions had issued a call for the ‘Bharat bandh’ to demand that the government halt the merger of public sector banks, disinvestment of pubic sector undertakings and the ongoing process of codification of 44 labour laws.

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Wednesday that the United States has reestablished some deterrence toward Iran in the wake of the January 3 drone strike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. “I think at this point with the strikes we took against KH in late December and then our actions with regard to Soleimani, I believe that we’ve restored a level of deterrence with them,” he told reporters, referring to Kataeb Hezbollah, an armed Iraqi group backed by Iran.

10,2020/01/09,Iran says rumours missile caused plane crash make 'no sense',"Iran on Thursday ruled out a missile strike as the cause of a Ukrainian passenger plane crash near Tehran, saying such a scenario made “no sense”.

The plane crashed shortly after take off Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, shortly after Iran fired a volley of missiles against military bases in Iraq housing US personnel.

“Several internal and international flights were flying at the same time in Iranian airspace at the same altitude of 8,000 feet (2,440 metres),” Iran's transport ministry said.

“This story of a missile striking a plane cannot be correct at all,” it said in a statement.

“Such rumours make no sense,” Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran's civil aviation organisation and deputy transport minister, said in the statement.

Mr. Abedzadeh was reacting to rumours on social networks that the Boeing 737 was hit by a missile fired by Iran's Revolutionary Guards.

He said Iran and Ukraine were in the process of “downloading information” from black boxes retrieved from the crash site.

“But if more specialised work is required to extract and analyse the data, we can do it in France or another country,” he added.

On Wednesday, Iran's Mehr news agency — close to ultraconservatives — quoted Abedzadeh as saying Iran “would not give the black boxes to the Americans”.

But the minister's statement on Thursday rejected “rumours of Iran's resistance to delivering the black boxes... to the U.S.”.

Iran is not obliged to have the black boxes analysed in the US, but America is one of only a few countries — including France and Germany — capable of carrying out such work.

Iranian authorities say initial indications showed the plane had turned back after suffering a problem.

A team of Ukrainian experts flew in and joined the investigation on the ground Thursday.

Kiev said it was studying several scenarios, including an in-flight collision, a rocket strike, an engine explosion caused by a technical problem, and an onboard blast.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9lf4ux/article30527323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-IRANPLANE-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-says-rumours-missile-caused-plane-crash-make-no-sense/article30527308.ece
11,2020/01/09,British MPs finally approve Brexit deal,"Britain's parliament finally approved Brexit on Thursday, allowing it to become the first country to leave the European Union by the end of this month, ending years of arguments that toppled two governments and divided a nation.

The House of Commons erupted in cheers after MPs ratified Prime Minister Boris Johnson's divorce deal with Brussels 330 votes to 231, drawing a line under an extraordinary era of political drama and chaos.

Also Read EU chief warns UK must compromise to get Brexit trade deal

For much of the time since the 2016 Brexit referendum, lawmakers have been at each others' throats over how, when or even if Britain should leave its closest trading partners after nearly 50 years.

Some viewed Brexit with horror, fearing that it stripped them of their European identities and turned Britain into an insular, less important nation.

Others embraced it with fervour, viewing it as a chance to ""take back control"" from officials in Brussels and see Britain regain some of its past might.

Businesses and governments in Europe, puzzled by Britain's struggles over what they viewed as a self-inflicted wound, hoped that Brexit could still somehow be undone.

But Mr. Johnson's comprehensive victory in last month's general election brought an abrupt end to the turmoil, giving his Conservatives a parliamentary majority with which to push it through.

MPs gave their initial blessing to the EU Withdrawal Agreement Bill before Christmas, and the government set aside just three days this week for detailed scrutiny of the complex text.

But few MPs even bothered to turn up on January 7 and January 8, with both sessions ending early, while the government easily saw off opposition attempts to amend the text.

The momentous day on which Mr. Johnson effectively gets permission to abandon the European integration project was all but ignored in Thursday's media.

Instead, it became a footnote to Prince Harry and his wife Meghan's decision to quit royal front-line duties — christened ""Megxit"" and shaping up to be equally complicated and divisive.

""We will be leaving the EU on January 31. We will have delivered on the PM's commitment to get Brexit done,"" a government spokesman said, echoing Mr. Johnson's election mantra.

Britain's main Opposition Labour party, bruised by its worst beating at the polls since 1935, voted against Brexit on January 9 knowing the battle had been lost.

We ""may not win many votes in parliament just now, but we can win the moral argument"", said Labour's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer, a potential successor to Jeremy Corbyn as party leader.

""Whatever [Johnson] says about the wider issues, he must know the government have got this wrong.""

The Brexit bill must still be passed by the unelected House of Lords and the European Parliament, which is seen as a formality.

Turning to trade

All eyes are now on another major challenge: the negotiation of a new relationship between Britain and the remaining 27 EU nations, which form the world's largest single market.

The Brexit deal covers separation issues such as EU citizens' rights and Britain's financial settlement, and sets out an 11-month transition period in which to agree a wider partnership.

Brussels warns the current deadline of December 31 this year is extremely tight, and has given London the option to ask for more time.

But Mr. Johnson insists there will be no extension of the transition period, saying that Britain must be free of EU rules as soon as possible.

Ahead of talks with Mr. Johnson on January 8, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it would be ""basically impossible"" to agree everything within London's timeframe.

""We will have to prioritise,"" she said in a speech to the London School of Economics university, warning of ""tough talks ahead"".

In response, Mr. Johnson's office indicated that it could accept a partial trade deal.

London did not want the EU's long-standing policy that ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" — intended to stop one side cherry-picking bits of a deal they like — to define the coming negotiations, a spokesman said.

13,2020/01/09,EU Council chief defends Iran deal after Trump call to quit it,"The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, defended the crumbling Iran nuclear deal on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump urged Europe to quit it, but warned Tehran against “irreversible acts” that would sink the accord.

The President of the European Council used a call with Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani to call for a de-escalation of tensions after Tehran carried out missile strikes on U.S. military bases in Iraq in retaliation for the assassination of one of its top Generals.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump calmed fears of all-out war, but demanded that other parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal follow his lead and withdraw from the pact.

The European parties — Britain, France and Germany — have led efforts to save the deal, which has been crumbling since Mr. Trump pulled out in 2018 and reimposed sanctions, and Mr. Michel insisted that it remained vital.

“The JCPOA agreement was an important achievement after 10 years of negotiations and remains an important tool for regional stability,” Mr. Michel’s office said in its readout of his call with Mr. Rouhani, adding that Mr. Michel had insisted that “the EU has its own interests and its vision” — implicitly distancing EU capitals from Washington.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4s2x2f/article30526519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Charles-Michel,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-council-chief-defends-iran-deal-after-trump-call-to-quit-it/article30526520.ece
14,2020/01/09,Pakistan’s Council of Islamic Ideology terms forced conversion ‘un-Islamic’,"Amidst increasing reports of forcible conversion of minorities in Pakistan, including that of Hindus and Sikhs, a constitutional body tasked with giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the lawmakers has said that such a practice was “un-Islamic and unconstitutional.”

The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) during its two-day session took up the matter of forced conversions and decided to include minority leaders in the consultation process, The News reported on Thursday, citing sources.

“They (CII) were of the view that Islam does not allow forced conversions. It was also proposed to the Ministry of Religious Affairs to prepare a performa for those who want to change their religion or accept Islam,” the paper said.

Addressing a press conference here after the two-day meeting, CII Chairman Dr. Qibla Ayaz said the forced conversion of religion is violation of the Islamic teachings and also breach of the Constitution.

India has repeatedly condemned the abduction, forced conversion, and marriage of minority girls in Pakistan.

In July last, Prime Minister Imran Khan had termed the practice of forced conversions as “un-Islamic” and said there was no precedent in Islamic history for forcefully converting others, according to media reports.

“How can we take it into our own hands to forcefully convert someone to Islam - either by marrying (non-Muslim) women (...) or on gunpoint or to (by threatening to) kill someone because of their religion?” he asked.

“All these things are un-Islamic. If God hadn’t given his messengers the power to impose their beliefs on someone, who are we (to do so)?” he asked, explaining that the messengers’ duty was only to spread the word of God.

In the same month, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the practice of forced conversions and abductions of Hindu girls must be stopped and action be taken against those involved in such activities.

The resolution came months after the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan in its annual report in April raised concerns about incidents of forced conversions and marriages of Hindu and Christian girls, saying around 1,000 such cases were reported in the southern Sindh province alone last year.

In March last year, two Hindu teenage sisters - Raveena, 13, and Reena, 15, were allegedly kidnapped by a group of “influential” men from their home in Ghotki district in Sindh on the eve of Holi. Soon after the kidnapping, a video went viral in which a cleric was purportedly shown soleminising the marriage of the two girls, triggering a nationwide outrage.

Hindus form the biggest minority community in Pakistan.

According to official estimates, 75 lakh Hindus live in Pakistan. However, according to the community, over 90 lakh Hindus are living in the country.

Majority of Pakistan’s Hindu population is settled in Sindh province where they share culture, traditions and language with their Muslim fellows.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Ayaz also said that the council has declared some of the clauses of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) ordinance as un-Islamic and against the Islamic Sharia.

Soon after Mr. Ayaz’s press conference, Science and Technology Minister Fawad Chaudhry expressed “serious concerns” about the council’s performance.

“Till today the religious segments [of the country] have not received any guidance from the ideological council,” he said, adding that he could not understand the logic behind spending millions of rupees on such an institution.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistans-council-of-islamic-ideology-terms-forced-conversion-un-islamic/article30524615.ece
15,2020/01/09,"Pope appeals to U.S. and Iran to pursue dialogue, self-restraint","Pope Francis on Thursday urged the United States and Iran to avoid escalation and pursue ”dialogue and self-restraint” to avert a wider conflict in the Middle East.

The pope made his appeal, his first direct comment on the current crisis, in a yearly speech that has come to be known as his “State of the World” address to ambassadors accredited to the Vatican.

Speaking for nearly 50 minutes in the Vatican's frescoed Sala Regia, the 83-year-old Roman Catholic leader offered a mostly grim overview of 2019, speaking of wars, global warming, xenophobia towards migrants and the danger of nuclear weapons.

“Particularly troubling are the signals coming from the entire region following the heightening of tensions between Iran and the United States,” Mr. Francis told the diplomats from more than 180 states.

He said the tensions risked “compromising the gradual process of rebuilding in Iraq, as well as setting the groundwork for a vaster conflict that all of us would want to avert”.

“I therefore renew my appeal that all the interested parties avoid an escalation of the conflict and keep alive the flame of dialogue and self-restraint, in full respect of international law,” he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested Iran was “standing down” after it fired missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq on Wednesday, itself an act of retaliation for the Jan. 3 U.S. strike that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani.

“Our human family is scarred and wounded by a succession of increasingly destructive wars that especially affect the poor and those most vulnerable,” Mr. Francis said.

“Sadly, the New Year does not seem to be marked by encouraging signs, as much as by heightened tensions and acts of violence,” he said.

Recent tensions could likely make it impossible for Mr. Francis to visit Iraq, which he has said he would like to do this year.

Wars and conflicts have led to an exodus of Christians from Iraq and some other countries in the Middle East.

Iraq's small Christian population of several hundred thousand suffered particular hardships when Islamic State controlled large parts of the country, but have recovered freedoms since the jihadists were pushed out.

Iraq is home to many different eastern rite churches, both Catholic and Orthodox.

Mr. Francis said he still hoped to make a visit this year to mostly Christian South Sudan, which is emerging from civil war.

The pope wove his speech around the foreign trips he made in 2019, which included a visit to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. There, he became the first pontiff to set foot on the Arabian peninsula, home to Islam's holiest sites.

Speaking of climate change, he said it was sad that the urgency to tackle it “seems not to have been grasped by international politics”.

He said last December's U.N. conference in Spain raised ”serious concern about the will of the international community to confront” the issue.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2e4n0f/article30523945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VATICANDIPLOMATS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pope-appeals-to-us-and-iran-to-pursue-dialogue-self-restraint/article30523947.ece
16,2020/01/09,"U.K. royals ‘hurt’ after Harry, Meghan quit front-line roles","Prince Harry and his celebrity wife Meghan’s bombshell resignation from front-line royal duties rocked the British monarchy on Thursday, with reports suggesting Queen Elizabeth II had not been informed in advance.

The couple said they would now “balance” their time between Britain and North America and rip up long-established relations with the press, in a surprise statement Wednesday that appeared to catch Buckingham Palace off guard.

In a short, terse response a short time later, a palace statement said discussions with Mr. Harry and Ms. Meghan were “at an early stage”.

“We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through,” the palace said.

Media reports said the couple made their shock statement -- released on their Instagram account, own website and through Buckingham Palace’s email communications system -- without notifying either Mr. Harry’s grandmother, the monarch, or father, the future king Prince Charles.

The mood in the palace was understood to be one of disappointment and even “hurt”, according the the BBC, while Thursday’s newspapers were full of reports of a family “split” and the queen’s “dismay”.

The decision follows a turbulent year for the pair, who have admitted to struggling in the spotlight and growing apart from Mr. Harry’s brother Prince William.

They have also complained of negative news coverage and taken several papers to court, another unusual move.

“We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the royal family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen,” they said.

“We have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,” they added.

Struggling in the spotlight

Mr. Harry, 35, and Ms. Meghan, 38, are among the most senior, core members of the royal family, and, along with Mr. William and his wife Kate, seen as embodying the monarchy’s future.

The pair spent six weeks over Christmas in Canada after speaking of the pressure of being in the spotlight following their fairytale wedding at Windsor Castle in May 2018 and son Archie’s birth 12 months later.

They skipped the royal family’s traditional Christmas at Sandringham, the sovereign’s private estate in eastern England, spending the festive season instead with Ms. Meghan’s American mother Doria Ragland.

Rumours that all was not well with the Sussexes surfaced in October when Mr. Harry, sixth in line to the throne, admitted that he and Mr. William were “on different paths” and had good and bad days in their relationship.

“We don’t see each other as much as we used to,” he told ITV television’s Tom Bradby, whom Mr. Harry and Mr. William have grown to trust with interviews over the years.

Asked by Mr. Bradby if she was “not really OK” and life had “really been a struggle” becoming a mother while living under intense media scrutiny, Ms. Meghan appeared emotional and replied simply: “Yes.”

Mr. Bradby said Wednesday that he sensed he was witnessing “a long, sad farewell to this royal life”.

“This is a new war of the Windsors -- and it’s not over yet.”

Media battle

In October, Mr. Harry issued a stinging statement about general tabloid coverage and launched the first of a handful of lawsuits against newspaper publishers.

Asked if Ms. Meghan was facing the same media pressures as his mother Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi, Mr. Harry told Mr. Bradby: “I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum.”

On a new website, the couple said they would no longer take part in the royal rota.

The rota system is an established arrangement between the palace and the press in which news organisations take turns covering events and then share the pictures, text and video with everyone else, avoiding the mass media scrambles of the past.

Instead the couple will attempt to invite only “specialist”, “grassroots”, “credible” and “young, up-and-coming” media to events.

Queen Elizabeth’s former press secretary Dickie Arbiter told Sky News television that the couple’s approach was “a succession of doing things their own way -- which is the wrong way”.

“Sometimes there’s good press; sometimes there’s bad press. You take the rough with the smooth.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2y7kja/article30523764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UKHARRYANDMEGHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-royals-hurt-after-harry-meghan-quit-front-line-roles/article30523765.ece
17,2020/01/09,British MPs set to finally seal Brexit deal,"After years of angry arguments that toppled two governments, Britain's parliament on Thursday will finally approve the terms of Brexit, clearing the divided country's exit from the European Union on January 31.

The House of Commons will rush through a final day of hearings and ratify Prime Minister Boris Johnson's divorce deal with Brussels, drawing a line under an extraordinary period of political chaos.

For much of the time since the 2016 Brexit referendum, lawmakers have been deadlocked over how, when and even if Britain should leave its closest trading partners after nearly 50 years.

Instead, it became a footnote to Prince Harry and Meghan's decision to quit royal front-line duties.

In a striking contrast to much of last year, when every Brexit vote risked bringing down the previous government and eventually did, Commons approval on Thursday is now a done deal.

The Brexit bill must still be passed by the unelected House of Lords and the European Parliament, but this is expected before January 31.

18,2020/01/09,Lebanon bans Ghosn from foreign travel,"Lebanon banned former auto tycoon Carlos Ghosn from travelling on Thursday after questioning him over an Interpol “red notice” of charges of financial misconduct in Japan, judicial sources said.

The 65-year-old businessman — for years venerated in Japan for turning around once-ailing Nissan — fled while awaiting trial on charges including allegedly under-reporting his compensation to the tune of $85 million.

His shock arrival in his native Lebanon last month was the latest twist in a story worthy of a Hollywood plot and prompted outrage from the Japanese government as well as from Nissan.

“The state prosecution issued a travel ban for Mr. Ghosn, and asked for his file from the Japanese authorities,” a judicial source said.

A second judicial source said: “He has been banned from travelling until his judicial file arrives from Japan.”

Lebanon's judiciary received a “red notice” from Interpol last week urging Mr. Ghosn's arrest.

A “red notice” is a request to police across the world to provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender or similar legal action. It is not an arrest warrant.

Lebanon does not have an extradition agreement with Japan.

Mr. Ghosn had also been expected to make a statement on a report submitted by Lebanese lawyers that he had travelled to neighbouring Israel as head of Renault-Nissan.

Lebanon and neighbouring Israel are still technically at war.

In early 2008, Mr. Ghosn travelled to Israel to announce the mass production of electric vehicles there with the cooperation of Renault-Nissan.

At a press conference in Beirut on Wednesday, Mr. Ghosn apologised to the Lebanese people for having visited the neighbouring country.

“I went as the head of Renault,” he said.

“I went as a Frenchman because of a contract between Renault and an Israeli company,” said Mr. Ghosn, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian nationalities.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7l6wwq/article30523489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEBANONGHOSN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lebanon-bans-ghosn-from-foreign-travel/article30523490.ece
19,2020/01/09,"Ukraine names Iran plane crash theories, including missile strike","A top Ukrainian security official on Thursday set out what he said were the four main theories for why a Ukrainian airliner crashed in Iran the previous day killing 176 people, including a possible missile strike and terrorism.

Oleksiy Danylov, secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, made his statement as an initial report by Iranian investigators said the plane, a Boeing 737-800, had been on fire immediately before it crashed.

Ukraine is looking at various possible causes of the crash, including a possible missile attack, a collision, an engine explosion or terrorism, he wrote in a Facebook post.

The crash happened hours after Iran launched missile attacks on U.S.-led forces in Iraq, leading some to speculate that the plane may have been hit.

But an initial assessment by Western intelligence agencies was that the plane had suffered a technical malfunction and had not been brought down by a missile, five security sources - three Americans, one European and the Canadian - who asked not to be named.

Mr. Danylov said Ukrainian investigators in Iran wanted to search the crash site for possible debris of a Russian missile after seeing reports about its possible existence on the internet.

He referred to an unverified image being circulated on Iranian social media purportedly showing the debris of a Russian-made Tor-M1 surface-to-air missile of the kind used by the Iranian military.

“Our (investigative) commission is talking to the Iranian authorities about visiting the crash site and is determined to search for fragments of a Russian Tor air defence missile about which there was information on the internet,” Mr. Danylov separately told Ukrainian news site Censor.net.

He said Ukraine would draw on expertise learnt from carrying out its own investigation into the 2014 shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH-17 over eastern Ukraine, an incident that killed all 298 people on board.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ihv0m7/article30513397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-CRASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ukraine-names-iran-plane-crash-theories-including-missile-strike/article30523172.ece
20,2020/01/09,Trump administration doesn’t want India to degrade its defence capabilities: U.S. official on CAATSA,"The Trump administration does not want to make a decision that degrades the defence capabilities of India which is its ‘Major Defence Partner’, a senior U.S. official has said, referring to the potential sanctions under CAATSA which prohibits countries from purchasing significant military equipment from Russia.

The US has said in the past it was working with countries, including India, to help them identify and avoid engaging in potentially sanctionable activities under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).

India and Russia signed the $5 billion S-400 air defence system deal in October 2018, after wide-ranging talks between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Responding to a question on implications of India going ahead with its decision to purchase S-400 missile defence system from Russia, the official said: “I know India has expressed valid concerns... they don’t want to have a sustainment line completely shut down... That’s the last thing we want to do with a significant partner. We don’t want to degrade their defence capabilities“.

The US has said that such a major purchase would come under the purview of the punitive CAATSA sanctions. It has already taken such an action against Turkey.

Many in India believe a Congressional waiver would bail it through. However, the US official insisted that there is no country-specific or blanket waiver for such a major defence purchase.

“What we don’t want India to do is to introduce something that as we continue to go forward in this partnership makes it challenging or exposes risk to our technology on future acquisitions,” said the official requesting anonymity.

“It has been reported in different places, mostly outside of the US, that there was an understanding that there’s a blanket waiver. There is not. I would start with that there is not a blanket waiver. Congress certainly never designed that or anticipated that, nor did the (Trump) administration,” said the official.

While there is not a blanket waiver, there is also not a blanket application, he said.

“There is a case-by-case analysis on where CAATSA sanctions could be applied. CAATSA sanctions also can range in depth as to how deep-cutting and to who, the entities and the people. And those options are always there,” the official said.

Officials from India and the United States -- which have seen galloping of their bilateral defence trade in last 15 years -- are having intense conversations on this issue. Any sanctions on India would have the potential to undo the improvement in the defence and strategic relationship, he said.

“Indian officials know that there is a risk of application of sanctions. Indian officials also know that we want to work with them to find a path forward where they have historic sustainment lines that certainly don’t put them at CAATSA risk.

“The challenge we have with any state like India is new acquisitions on significant systems that would either put at risk our platforms or expose our technologies to an adversary. And so we said this very simple — Turkey was a perfect example. The S-400 put at risk the F-35. The S-400 also could put at risk other platforms, and so we’ve had these conversations very candidly with all partners,” said the senior State Department official.

The S-400 is known as Russia’s most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system. China was the first foreign buyer to seal a government-to-government deal with Russia in 2014 for the system.

The US recognised India as a “Major Defence Partner” in 2016, a designation that allows India to buy more advanced and sensitive technologies from America at par with that of the US’ closest allies and partners, and ensures enduring cooperation into the future.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hg4qlc/article27394114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-MISSILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-admin-doesnt-want-india-to-degrade-its-defence-capabilities-us-official-on-caatsa/article30521731.ece
21,2020/01/09,UN chief warns world cannot afford another war amid U.S.-Iran tensions,"In the wake of an Iranian ballistic missile attack on air bases which house U.S. forces in Iraq, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said he would continue his active engagement to de-escalate tensions and avert full-scale war, which the “world cannot afford.”

In a statement released by his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric on Wednesday, Guterres re-iterated the “passionate appeal for peace” he made on Monday, after tensions rose dramatically across the whole Gulf region, following the killing of top Iranian general, Qassim Soleimani, in a U.S. drone strike.

Iran said it had carried out pre-dawn ballistic missile attack on Wednesday against two air bases used by the U.S. and other coalition forces in Iraq, in retaliation for the targeted killing on the outskirts of Baghdad airport on Friday.

The bases struck were the large Al Asad base, west of Baghdad, and another in Erbil, the centre of Iraq’s Kurdish region. The strikes came just hours after the burial of the influential general, marked by huge crowds, in Iran.

The UN chief repeated his four-point message to world leaders, to: “Stop escalation. Exercise maximum restraint. Re-start dialogue”, and “renew international cooperation.”

“This appeal remains as important today as it was on Monday. For his part, the Secretary-General will continue his active engagement with relevant actors,” the statement said.

Guterres said it is “our common duty to make every effort to avoid a war in the Gulf that the world cannot afford. We must not forget the terrible human suffering caused by war. As always, ordinary people pay the highest price,” Guterres said.

The UN Iraq mission also called for ‘urgent restraint.’ Citing the missile attacks in Erbil and Anbar governorates, the UN Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) said the offensive served to “only escalate conflict, and again violate Iraqi sovereignty.”

The mission said in a tweet, “Senseless violence has predictable effects. We call for urgent restraint and a resumption of dialogue. Iraq should not pay the price for external rivalries.”

During his daily press briefing, Dujarric added that “we very much support the unity, the sovereignty of Iraq.

He said the UN chief had spoken by phone on Tuesday with Iraq’s President Barham Salih, “to whom he expressed the solidarity of the United Nations and continuing support for the Iraqi people.

“The international community should support the Iraqi people as they seek to create the conditions for political dialogue, he added.

Following a statement made by U.S. President Donald Trump from the White House on Wednesday, Dujarric added: “We welcome any indication that leaders are walking back from major confrontation, and are doing whatever they can, to avoid any further escalation.

Guterres stressed in a tweet that Peace is our most precious value. It is the product of hard work and we must never take it for granted.

He said he is encouraged by signs that the escalating conflict in the Gulf may be subsiding. The world cannot afford another war.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1jkwbf/article30521729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANTONIOGUTERRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-chief-warns-world-cannot-afford-another-war-amid-us-iran-tensions/article30521730.ece
22,2020/01/09,Iran investigators say Ukrainian plane never called for help,"Iranian investigators said Thursday the crew members of the Ukrainian jetliner that crashed on Wednesday never made a radio call for help and were trying to turn back to the airport when the plane went down.

Iran’s civil aviation authority made the comments in a preliminary crash report a day after the crash of the Ukrainian jetliner that killed all 176 people on board.

The investigators also said that the plane was engulfed in fire before it crashed. They said the crash caused a massive explosion when the plane hit the ground, likely because the aircraft had been fully loaded with fuel for the flight to Kyiv, Ukraine.

The report also confirmed that both of the so-called “black boxes” that contain data and cockpit communications from the plane had been recovered, though they had damaged and some parts of their memory was lost.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy meanwhile said the crash investigators from his country had arrived in Iran to assist in the probe. He also said he planned to call President Hassan Rouhani about the crash and the investigation.

Undoubtedly, the priority for Ukraine is to identify the causes of the plane crash,” Mr. Zelenskiy said. “We will surely find out the truth.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6t7dtq/article30521577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IranPlaneCrash,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-investigators-say-ukrainian-plane-never-called-for-help/article30521578.ece

24,2020/01/09,"Australia bushfire crisis: 24 killed, over 6 million hectares of land burned","Australia’s raging bushfire crisis, one of the worst in its history, has killed 24 people, burned over six million hectares of land, reduced to ashes hundreds of homes and pushed many species towards extinction, officials said on Thursday.

Authorities on Thursday issued fresh warnings and evacuation orders in the country’s southeast as hot and windy conditions threatened to regenerate huge bushfires.

Around 23 fires were still burning in Victoria, according the State’s emergency management commissioner Andrew Crisp.

Premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews on Thursday announced extending the State’s first-ever state of disaster ahead of “significant fire activity” forecast for the next two days.

“We have forecast conditions of extreme danger, very significant fire activity is likely off the back of a hot day today, a hot day tomorrow and a change not coming through in the east of the State until late afternoon tomorrow and in the northern part of the State not until the evening on Saturday,” he said.

“This means that we have every reason to believe there will be significant fire activity over the next 48 hours and that means it is appropriate that we continue the state of disaster,” Mr. Andrews said.

There will be messages going out to communities in the fire zone on Thursday and those messages will indicate to people that they are in the fire zone and that if they can leave, they should leave, he said, adding that “we will not be able to guarantee their safety“.

There was a possibility of another round of dry lightning and a wind change which could trigger fires across the State from Friday.

“This is a really significant challenge for us. We don’t underestimate it. We don’t lightly extend the state of disaster. We have done it because we believe that it will save lives and that, after all, is the most important thing,” Andrews said.

Victoria’s emergency management commissioner Crisp said that in the State, 244 homes were lost or damaged and another 400 ‘significant’ structures impacted.

“We know those numbers will grow,” he said.

Meanwhile in New South Wales, State premier Gladys Berejiklian announced an additional 1 billion Australian dollar over the next two years into bushfire management and recovery for rebuilding and rehabilitating the fire ravaged zones.

This season saw the worst damages across the State with almost 2000 homes damaged so far and over 20 deaths.

Ms. Berejiklian said the new funding would prioritise infrastructure repair and help stimulate fire-ravaged NSW communities.

“The bushfire season is far from over but we know how important it is for communities to start the recovery process where possible,” Ms. Berejiklian said in a statement.

She said the funding was on top of 231 million dollar already committed to disaster assistance funding.

In South Australia’s Kangaroo Island, the bushfire threat on Thursday was escalated with ‘a watch and act warning’ issued for a fire near Parndana which according to the Country Fire Service (CFS) was uncontrolled and was burning in a south-easterly direction threatening the safety of people in the area.

The fire has already destroyed 160,000 hectares including the famous Flinders Chase National Park.

A total fire ban has been declared across the island following the high fire risk due to temperatures and winds rise.

“Currently there is no immediate threat to life or property but with increasing wind, warmer weather and ongoing fires on Kangaroo Island, this situation is likely to change,” the CFS said.

Over six million hectares of land has burned in this year’s worst bushfire season of Australian history, claiming 24 lives and damaging hundreds of homes and buildings across several parts of southern New South Wales, northern and eastern Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, according to officials.

The raging fire has pushed many species towards extinction, with the number of kangaroos, koalas and others killed in the crisis keeps increasing.

According to some experts, an estimated 1 billion animals have been killed.

The bushfire crisis has taken a very heavy toll with more than 1,500 homes already lost throughout the course of this fire season, which has been running since September, according to the government.

Over 3,000 firefighters are on the frontline, with 31 specialist strike teams in place across NSW.

Australia’s military has been assisting with aerial reconnaissance, mapping, search and rescue, logistics and aerial support for months.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who is facing widespread criticism in Australia for his handling of the crisis, on Monday announced an additional 2 billion dollars over two years to a new agency to coordinate a national response to rebuild communities and livelihoods following the deadly bushfire crisis.

The National Bushfire Recovery Agency, headed by former federal police chief Andrew Colvin, will help bushfire affected communities recover.

The militants entered Monguno in Borno state posing as a convoy of soldiers on Tuesday evening, the sources said. They then attacked troops inside the town, destroying at least 750 homes in the process.

Resident Gumati Sadu said people fled into the bush for safety during the fighting and that three civilians were killed by stray bullets.

A military spokesman declined to comment.

Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) claimed responsibility for the attack on its Amaq news agency.

It said that one of its militants detonated a car bomb in the town, killing at least 8 soldiers and destroying 3 armoured vehicles.

The group also said it had seized a vehicle, weapons and ammunition before leaving the town.

ISWAP split from Islamist group Boko Haram in 2016 and has since staged its own frequent attacks in the region.

Boko Haram's decade-long insurgency campaign has killed thousands and displaced millions in northeastern Nigeria.

26,2020/01/09,Iran sending messages to militias not to move against American targets: Pence,"Vice President Mike Pence has claimed that the US has received some “encouraging intelligence” that Iran has asked its militia not to move against American targets or civilians after the assassination of a top commander of its powerful Revolutionary Guards.

Mr. Pence’s remarks came after U.S. President Donald Trump said in an address on Wednesday that no Americans were harmed in the attack by Iran on U.S. bases in Iraq.

Iran launched 22 ballistic missiles in a pre-dawn attack on Wednesday targeting at least two bases where US military and coalition forces are stationed in Iraq, which Tehran said was a “slap in the face” of America.

“We are receiving some encouraging intelligence that Iran is sending messages to those very same militias not to move against American targets or civilians. And we hope that that message continues to echo, Mr. Pence told CBS News in an interview on Wednesday night.

Mr. Pence stood alongside President Trump when the latter addressed the nation from the White House wherein, he did not announce any fresh military action in response to Iran’s ballistic missiles hitting U.S. military base in Iraq.

In his first interview, Mr. Pence said that the U.S. is safer today after the killing of Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guards General Qasem Soleimani, which was ordered by Mr. Trump.

“I think the American people can rest easier tonight thanks to the leadership that President Donald Trump provided and the extraordinary and courageous professionalism that our military demonstrated over the last several weeks. Despite missile attacks yesterday, again because of the professionalism— of our military personnel and their preparedness— there were no American casualties, no Iraqi casualties, and our information as of this afternoon continues to be that Iran is standing down,” he said.

The Trump administration, he said, does not seek regime change in Iran, but wants to see the regime change its behaviour.

“We are dealing with a country that’s been the leading state sponsor of terrorism for more than 20 years. And so we’ll continue to be prepared. We’ll continue to confront Iran in the way that President Trump has done since early in this administration,” he said in response to a question.

Mr. Pence said following assassination of Soleimani on Friday in a U.S. air strike, the U.S. has received intelligence over the previous several days that there may be attacks coming.

According to the Iranian state TV, the missile attacks by Iran on Wednesday were in revenge for the killing of General Soleimani.

The Iranian state television claimed that “at least 80 terrorist U.S. soldiers” were killed in the strikes. Some 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the IS terror group.

“We heard the threats. The world heard the threats from Iran. We moved forces. We provided a level of force protection at the president’s direction. And in a very real sense, we had the early warning systems that allowed us to move Americans and our allies out of harm’s way,” he said.

“Let me say that the fact that no American lives were lost was a great relief I know to the president, to myself, to our entire national security team, as it is to every American,” he asserted.

The United States, he said, is safer today than before Trump ordered military to take out Soleimani.

“This was a man who had been leading a terrorist state-sponsored organisation in the region sowing violence. But what President Trump, our commander in chief, demonstrated was we have a president who’s also willing to use American military might to protect American lives,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7qvp5z/article30521223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MIKEPENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-sending-messages-to-militias-not-to-move-against-american-targets-pence/article30521224.ece
27,2020/01/09,Philippines’ Catholics parade “Black Nazarene” in celebration of Christ,"Hundreds of thousands of Roman Catholics in the Philippines walked barefoot on Thursday around a centuries-old black wooden statue of Jesus Christ believed to have healing powers, praying for good health and economic success in the new year.

Devotees clad in yellow and maroon thronged the life-sized statue known as the “Black Nazarene” as it was paraded through the streets of Manila aboard a rope-pulled carriage, in one of the main annual festivals in Asia's largest Catholic nation. “I joined the procession to wish for good fortune for my family, good health and for my future plans,” Ian Lanaria, 24, told Reuters.

Participating for the first time, Ms. Lanaria said he had decided to join after previously watching the mass ritual on television and hearing about the miracles from his friends.

People were seen jostling through the crowd of police to be near the statue as it crawled through the capital, believing that a slight touch would bless them, heal their illnesses and those of their relatives.

Thursday's procession is expected to last for hours, and organisers expected it to draw 6 million people as the crowds swell over the day.

An early morning estimate by police put the crowd at around 400,000 people, excluding those waiting further along the procession's six-km (3.7 miles) route.

Having had his prayers answered when he was in need of money in the past, Bonny Morales (65), was among the early worshippers.

30,2020/01/09,Japan urges Ghosn to return as fugitive tycoon defends escape,"Japan's justice minister on Thursday urged Carlos Ghosn to return and make his case in court, after the fugitive former auto tycoon gave an impassioned defence of his decision to jump bail and flee to Lebanon.

Ghosn made his first public appearance since his audacious December escape at a combative press conference in Beirut on Wednesday, where he slammed Japan and said he had been forced to flee because he would not get a fair trial.

The ex-chairman of Nissan-Renault faced four charges of financial misconduct in Japan, which he alleges were cooked up by disgruntled executives at Nissan in collusion with Japanese prosecutors.

On Thursday, Japanese Justice Minister Masako Mori called those claims ""baseless"" and insisted Ghosn's ""assertions will not justify his flight from Japan in any way.""

""If defendant Ghosn has anything to say on his criminal case, he should make his argument in a Japanese court and present concrete evidence,"" she added. ""If he claims innocence, he should face a trial under the justice system in Japan, where he was doing business, and he should submit evidence to prove his claims.""

'Presumed guilty'

The former car magnate spent much of his two-hour press conference insisting that justice was impossible for him in Japan. He argued that the charges against him, including allegedly under-reporting his pay and skimming Nissan funds for his own personal use, were a bid to bring him down for political reasons.

""There was no way I was going to be treated fairly... this was not about justice,"" he told reporters, responding to questions in English, Arabic, French and Portuguese. Ghosn said he was ""presumed guilty before the eyes of the world and subject to a system whose only objective is to coerce confessions, secure guilty pleas.""

Ghosn has argued since his shock November 2018 arrest that the case against him was a bid to block his plans to more closely integrate Nissan with its French partner Renault. On Wednesday, he alleged extensive collusion between the Japanese automaker and prosecutors and said he was the victim of character assassination.

The Tokyo prosecutor's office hit back late Wednesday, saying ""Ghosn's allegations completely ignore his own conduct...His one-sided criticism of the Japanese justice system is totally unacceptable,"" the prosecutor's office said.

Former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, a one-time Ghosn protege who was forced to resign in the wake of the scandal, also hit out on Thursday. Ghosn ""fled because he was afraid of being found guilty,"" Saikawa told reporters.

The 65-year-old businessman was out on bail in Tokyo when he launched his audacious escape plan, and said he decided to flee after his lawyers told him he could wait five years for a verdict.

He also accused prosecutors of imposing strict conditions on his contact with his wife Carole in a bid to ""break"" him. Prosecutors in Tokyo this week obtained an arrest warrant for Carole, who is also in Lebanon, alleging she lied to a Japanese court.

Ghosn refused to shed any further light on how he managed to slip past authorities and flee Japan at the end of December — an astonishing feat given his high-profile status and the restrictions he faced.

Under his bail terms, his passports were confiscated, his home monitored and his internet access limited to a computer at his lawyer's office.

Despite that, he appears to have formulated an elaborate plan with security experts who smuggled him onto a private jet at an airport near Osaka, packed into an audio equipment case. The plane whisked him to Istanbul, where he boarded a second private jet and continued to Lebanon, which does not have an extradition treaty with Japan. Interpol has issued a ""red notice"" at Japan's request, but it remains unclear how Tokyo can bring Ghosn back to the country to face trial.

He said Wednesday he plans to take measures, including possibly challenging the Interpol notice, in a bid to clear his name, but would not be drawn on whether he planned to travel outside Lebanon.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/19ive1/article30520469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001NJ9KW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japan-urges-ghosn-to-return-as-fugitive-tycoon-defends-escape/article30520470.ece
31,2020/01/09,U.S. appeals court stays judge’s ruling blocking military funds for border wall,"A U.S. federal appeals court on Wednesday put on hold a lower court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump's administration from using $3.6 billion in military construction funds to build a wall on the country's border with Mexico.

The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a stay pending the Trump administration's appeal of a Dec. 10 decision by a federal judge that barred the funding transfer.

In a 2-1 ruling, the panel noted that the U.S. Supreme Court had stayed an injunction in a similar border wall case from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

The court also said there was a “substantial likelihood” that the parties challenging the funding transfer the county of El Paso, Texas, and the Border Network for Human Rights - lacked standing to sue the Trump administration.

Mr. Trump has made stemming illegal immigration a major theme of his presidency and re-election campaign. The $3.6 billion amounts to a third of the approximately $10 billion that Mr. Trump has obtained for border wall construction during his presidency, a total that comes from congressional appropriations and redirected Defense Department and Treasury Department funds.

Mr. Trump contends the wall will stem illegal crossings and narcotics trafficking. Congressional Democrats have portrayed the president's signature project as divisive and a waste of resources. Congress has approved funding for wall construction in recent years, but at levels below Trump administration requests.

Frustrated by Congress, Mr. Trump declared illegal immigration to be a national emergency in February 2019 as part of a plan to access billions of dollars in Pentagon and Treasury funds to build the wall.

Trump administration officials have pledged to build 724 km of new and replacement barriers along the border by November 2020, when Mr. Trump will face re-election. But a number of obstacles, including legal challenges and resistance from private landowners, have threatened that objective.

Acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan said in December that the administration may fall short of the 450-mile mark. Morgan specifically cited the federal court injunction blocking the $3.6 billion funding transfer as an obstacle to construction.

The Trump administration has erected 96 miles (155 km) of border wall since the president took office in January 2017, according to CBP statistics current to late December. All of those structures replaced existing barriers, but border wall construction in new areas is under way, the agency said.

Mr. Trump vowed during his 2016 presidential campaign to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and force Mexico to pay for it. The Mexican government, however, has refused to fund the project.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article23415671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2INTHROHTRUMPWALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-appeals-court-stays-judges-ruling-blocking-military-funds-for-border-wall/article30520347.ece
32,2020/01/09,U.S. House to vote on preventing Trump from Iran war,"The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will vote Thursday to prevent President Donald Trump from waging war with Iran after he ordered the killing of a top general, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.

Pelosi said that the Democrats will move forward because their concerns were not addressed in a closed-door briefing to lawmakers Wednesday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top officials.

""The President has made clear that he does not have a coherent strategy to keep the American people safe, achieve de-escalation with Iran and ensure stability in the region,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Our concerns were not addressed by the president's insufficient War Powers Act notification and by the administration's briefing today.""

Under the 1973 War Powers Act, the administration needs to notify Congress on major military actions but Trump, unusually, has kept classified his rationale for a strike that killed powerful Iranian general Qasem Soleimani while he was in Iraq.

Pelosi said that the House would therefore vote, under the 1973 act, to limit Trump's ability to wage war against Iran.

She said that the House may also soon consider revoking the authorization of force approved after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Three successive administrations have cited that authorization as legal justification for an array of military actions across the Islamic world.

But any move to constrain Trump would likely have a difficult chance of passage in the Senate, where his Republican Party holds a majority.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lt3skw/article30474544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-POLITICS-TRUMP-IRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-house-to-vote-on-preventing-trump-from-iran-war/article30520270.ece
33,2020/01/09,Prince Harry and Meghan to 'step back' as senior UK royals,"Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, say they plan “to step back” as senior members of Britain’s royal family, a stunning announcement that underscores the couple’s wish to forge a new path for royals in the modern world.

A statement issued on January 8 evening by Buckingham Palace, described as “a personal message from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex,” said Harry and Meghan intend to become ""financially independent” and to “balance” their time between the U.K. and North America.

""After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,” the statement said. “We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the royal family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support her majesty the queen.”

The 35-year-old Harry, the youngest son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana, is Queen Elizabeth II’s grandson and sixth in line to the British throne. He is considered one of the royal family’s most popular members.

Before marrying the Prince in a royal wedding watched around the world in 2018, the 38-year-old Duchess of Sussex was an American actor known as Meghan Markle and a star of the TV show “Suits.” The couple’s first child, Archie, was born in May 2019.

Among the guests were 2200 members of the public, the royal family and Ms. Markle's Mother Doria Ragland.

In their statement, the couple did not reveal where in North America they plan to make a second home, but they cited their baby as a reason why they decided to live part of their time outside Britain.

""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity,” it read.

The message about the couple’s plans also appeared on their official Instagram feed, along with a link to a website, sussexroyal.com, where followers could find more information.

The website elaborated on why they are seeking financial independence from the monarchy’s funding mechanism, known as the “Sovereign Grant.” A page on the site states the grant they are forsaking covers just 5% of the costs for the Duke and Duchess and is used for their official office expenses.

Meghan and Harry “value the ability to earn a professional income, which in the current structure they are prohibited from doing,” the website states. “Their Royal Highnesses feel this new approach will enable them to continue to carry out their duties for Her Majesty the Queen, while having the future financial autonomy to work externally.

As an actor and a human rights activist, the Duchess was accustomed to media attention before her marriage, but she has made no secret that the transition to being a global celebrity and part of Britain’s royal family was difficult.

Struggles with the media

The royal couple particularly took issue with their treatment at the hands of the British tabloids, whose aggressive coverage of all things royal is legendary. In October, Meghan sued a newspaper for copyright infringement for publishing a letter she wrote to her estranged father. Later that month, Harry brought his own claim against two of the most popular tabloids over alleged hacking of phone voicemail messages.

The Prince also lashed out at the British media for its treatment of Meghan, accusing the press of hounding his wife the same way it did his mother. Princess Diana died in a 1997 car crash while trying to elude paparazzi in Paris. “My deepest fear is history repeating itself. I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditized to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces,” Harry said.

The royal couple revealed their struggles with the media during an ITV documentary “Harry & Meghan - An African Journey,” which followed them on their autumn tour of Southern Africa. Both said they had struggled with the spotlight and that much of what was printed about them is untrue.

The Duchess told ITV that her British friends warned her not to marry the Prince because of the intense media scrutiny that would follow in his country. But the U.S. television star said she “naively” dismissed the warnings, because as an American she didn’t understand how the British press worked.

""I never thought this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair. And that is the part that is hard to reconcile,” Meghan said. “But (I) just take each day as it comes.”

The Duchess said the pressure was aggravated by the fact that she went quickly from being a newlywed to being pregnant and then a new mother.

The British media have also made much of an alleged rift between Harry and his older brother, Prince William, who is second in line to the throne. Harry and Meghan last year opted out of living at Kensington Palace in London, where William and his family lives, and moved to a Frogmore Cottage at Windsor.

In the ITV interview, Harry acknowledged there have been some differences between him and the 37-year-old William, although he said most of what has been printed about a rift between the two brothers has been “created out of nothing.”

""Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it’s under, inevitably stuff happens,” he said. “But, look, we’re brothers. We’ll always be brothers. We’re certainly on different paths at the moment, but I will always be there for him, as I know he’ll always be there for me.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uy7ydi/article28135412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THRDHARRY-and-meghan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/prince-harry-and-meghan-to-step-back-as-senior-uk-royals/article30520193.ece
34,2020/01/09,Pentagon chief: US has restored ‘level of deterrence’ on Iran,"U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Wednesday that the United States has reestablished some deterrence toward Iran in the wake of the January 3 drone strike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad.

“I think at this point with the strikes we took against KH in late December and then our actions with regard to Soleimani, I believe that we’ve restored a level of deterrence with them,” he told reporters, referring to Kataeb Hezbollah, an armed Iraqi group backed by Iran.

“But we will see. Time will tell,” Mr. Esper said.

Esper’s comments came after Iran fired a volley of ballistic missiles Wednesday into two bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops, in response to Soleimani’s killing.

No U.S. or Iraqi personnel were killed in those strikes, and reports said the U.S. knew that an attack was coming.

The Pentagon also said its own “early warning systems” detected the incoming missiles in advance, allowing personnel to avoid injury.

Joint Chiefs Chairman General Mark Milley dismissed suggestions that Iran did not intend to kill Americans with its missile barrage, which struck the sprawling Ain al-Asad airbase in western Iraq and a base in Arbil, both housing American and other foreign troops with the U.S.-led coalition fighting the Islamic State group.

“I believe, based on what I saw and what I know, is that they were intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel. That’s my own personal assessment,” Mr. Milley told reporters.

“But we took sufficient defensive measures that there were no casualties to U.S. personnel, coalition personnel, contractors or Iraqis.” Mr. Esper also downplayed the firing of two rockets into Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone late Wednesday, where the U.S. and other foreign embassies are located and many U.S. troops are based.

“We should have some expectation that the Shia militia groups, either directed or not directed by Iran, will continue in some way, shape or form to try and undermine our presence there, either politically or, you know, take some type of kinetic actions against us or do Lord-knows-what,” Mr. Esper told reporters.

A top Iraqi paramilitary commander, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, was also killed in the strike on Soleimani last week.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/f30oqq/article30464291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-IRAQ-UNREST-IRAN-ESPER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pentagon-chief-us-has-restored-level-of-deterrence-on-iran/article30519509.ece
35,2020/01/09,EU chief warns UK must compromise to get Brexit trade deal,"Three weeks before Britain is due to leave the European Union, the president of the European Commission warned Wednesday that the U.K. won’t get the “highest quality access” to the European Union’s market after Brexit unless it makes major concessions.

In a friendly but frank message to the U.K., Ursula Von der Leyen said negotiating a new U.K.-EU trade deal will be tough. She also said the end-of-2020 deadline that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has imposed on negotiations makes it “basically impossible” to strike a comprehensive new agreement in time.

Von der Leyen, who took over as head of the EU’s executive branch on December 1, met Mr. Johnson at 10 Downing Street in London on Wednesday for the first time since the British leader’s election victory last month.

Mr. Johnson’s Conservatives won a substantial parliamentary majority in Britain’s December 12 election, giving him the power to end more than three years of wrangling over Brexit and take the U.K. out of the EU on January 31. It will be the first nation to ever leave the bloc, which currently has 28 members.

Britain’s departure will be followed by a transition period in which the U.K.-EU relationship will remain largely unchanged while the two sides negotiate a new trade arrangement.

Mr. Johnson says the UK is seeking a wide-ranging free trade deal, but doesn’t want to agree to keep all EU rules and standards.

Mr. Johnson’s office said after the meeting that the UK wanted “a broad free trade agreement covering goods and services, and cooperation in other areas.” But it said “any future partnership must not involve any kind of alignment” in which Britain would automatically follow EU rules.

That could cause problems. Speaking at the London School of Economics before her meeting with Mr. Johnson, von der Leyen warned that “without a level playing field on environment, labor, taxation and state aid, you cannot have the highest quality access to the world’s largest single market.” “With every choice comes a consequence. With every decision comes a trade-off,” she warned.

The EU worries that Britain plans to cut environmental and employment standards in order to position itself as a low-regulation, low-tax competitor to the bloc.

Mr. Johnson sought to allay those fears, telling Von der Leyen the UK would continue to maintain high standards “in areas like workers’ rights, animal welfare, agriculture and the environment,” Downing St said.

International trade agreements typically take years to complete, but Johnson has ruled out extending the post-Brexit transition period beyond the end of 2020, although the EU has offered to prolong it until 2022.

Downing Street said Wednesday that “both British and EU citizens rightly expect negotiations on an ambitious free trade agreement to conclude on time.” Von der Leyen said the time frame was “very, very tight” and made it “basically impossible” to negotiate anything but a skeleton deal.

“The more divergence there is, the more distant the partnership has to be,” she said. “And without an extension of the transition period beyond 2020, you cannot expect to agree on every single aspect of our new partnership. We will have to prioritize.”

The German EU chief — who studied in Britain in the 1970s and has proclaimed herself a friend and fan of Britain — did have some encouraging words for Johnson. She said the bloc was ready to strike a tariff-free and quota-free trade deal with Britain, and “a partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope.”

She said the new relationship could encompass “everything “rom climate action to data protection, fisheries to energy, transport to space, financial services to security. And we are ready to work day and night to get as much of this done within the time frame we have. At the start of the meeting, Mr. Johnson noted that he and Von der Leyen had attended the same Belgian school — the European School in Brussels, where both lived for a time as children. Mr. Johnson, 55, is six years younger than the EU chief.

Mr. Johnson’s election victory broke Britain’s political stalemate over Brexit. His 80-seat House of Commons majority means he has the votes to get his Brexit deal approved by lawmakers, something his predecessor Theresa May never achieved.

Mr. Johnson’s key Brexit bill was approved in principle last month and is expected to pass its final House of Commons hurdle on Thursday after three days of debate. It also must be approved by the European Parliament.

Von der Leyen said she did not anticipate a delay and expected the U.K. to leave the EU on January 31.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6sgw71/article30517798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINEUBREXITSG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eu-chief-warns-uk-must-compromise-to-get-brexit-trade-deal/article30517799.ece

38,2020/01/09,Two rockets hit Iraqi capital’s Green Zone: security sources,"Two rockets crashed late Wednesday into the Iraqi capital's Green Zone, the high-security enclave where foreign embassies including the U.S.mission are based, security sources told AFP.

Just before midnight, AFP correspondents in Baghdad heard two loud blasts followed by the wailing security sirens of the Green Zone.

The attack came nearly 24 hours after Tehran launched ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases housing American and other coalition forces, which did not cause casualties.

The strikes were in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and Iraqi commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis last week.

Muhandis had been the deputy head of the Hashed al-Shaabi, a web of armed groups incorporated into the Iraqi state but which also have close ties to Tehran.

The United States had accused Hashed groups of being behind a string of rocket attacks on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and bases hosting American troops across the country.

On Wednesday, the Hashed's hardline factions vowed they, too, would take revenge for the U.S. raid.

Paramilitary chief Qais al-Khazali -- blacklisted as a ""terrorist"" by the U.S. -- said Iraq's response to the U.S. ""will be no less than the size of the Iranian response.""

Harakat al-Nujaba, a hardline Hashed faction, vowed to avenge Muhandis.

Revenge for the martyr Muhandis is coming at the hands of Iraqis -- until the last soldier among you leaves,"" it said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/no0coj/article30519397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001NJ6BB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-rockets-hit-iraqi-capitals-green-zone-security-sources/article30518988.ece
39,2020/01/09,"Yuvan Shankar Raja: 'I avoid thinking about the past, only take lessons from it'","Yuvan Shankar Raja has been a music sensation for more than two decades now. With an illustrious career featuring movies such as Dheena, Nandha, Thulluvadho Ilamai, 7G Rainbow Colony, Billa, and more recently, Maari 2, and Hero to his credit, Yuvan, who is 40 years old, started off envisioning a life with and for music when he was 15.

Paying a touch-and-go visit to Madurai to unveil commercial ad film Cutie Pei for the launch of six advanced diagnostic labs in Southern districts by Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre, the musician spoke of his upcoming releases and current music trends. Excerpts from a quick chat:

How was the experience working on an ad film?

I have done it for a good cause, for the importance given to health. I am sure my fans will be happy to see my work.

How excited are you about your first release of 2020, Bommai?

I am super excited as always. I have completed around 150 films but I look forward to every new film with the same enthusiasm and anxiety.

Is there a new genre that you would like to explore?

There are hundreds of things I want to keep trying. It is never easy to pinpoint a particular concept or genre. There is so much to learn and explore in music and I have always found it hard to narrow it down.

What does music mean to you?

For me, music is like a person I revere. It will always be with me and for me.

How do see your journey thus far?

I do not look back. If I do so, it makes me nervous. I avoid thinking about the past. I only take lessons from it. But the future is always challenging. Everyday is a new learning experience. I am not the type who likes to predict where I will be in the next 10 years. I simply live for the present and do my work with dedication and passion.

What do you think of the multitude of music streaming apps in the market these days?

I would consider them a boon as long as the artistes are being paid. They [the apps] are a good way to monitor your track and the digitisation. We get to monitor how many streams are made and pinpoint the location, where our music is listened to. Within a period of time, our music will reach a wider audience, eventually everybody will have access to it.

K-pop is a sensation among young adults these days. What do you think about Asian music’s worldwide reach?

People are looking at Asian music closely and tracks that capture [their interest] will get the spotlight. I sensed this after ‘Rowdy Baby’ became the most played song on YouTube. K-pop is definitely big and I do listen to a few tracks. I am confident that Indian music will also be in the same lane soon.

Is there that one fan you can never forget?

I remember this guy at a function who climbed on to the stage to just hold my hand. He did not care about the bouncers and didn’t even speak to me. He just wanted to be near me.

Do you have any advice for budding musicians?

Just keep listening to good music.

40,2020/01/09,What’s the good word,"The Karnataka State Scrabble Association has been organising an international scrabble tournament every year which sees participation from students across countries, including world champions such as Nigel Richards. The 16th Chapter of the tournament is to take place from January 9 to 12 at Whitefield. Ahead of the International Scrabble Tournament 2020, Shankar Prasad, President of Karnataka State Scrabble Association, says scrabble is no more discussed just for the improvement it brings about in language and vocabulary. “Dedicated players find scrabble going beyond casual gaming. It is analytical, with the ability to strengthen one’s strategy, memory and concentration skills. We are keen to encourage people taking up playing scrabble in the city too,” says Shankar Prasad in an interview with Metroplus. Excerpts

What is the biggest rush for a Scrabble player?

One thing common for scrabble participants is the excitement of finding the right word and out-scoring opponents in tournaments. The better ranked your opponents, the bigger is the pleasure of outwitting them. The rush of having spotted a great word to score big is huge. Most regular scrabble players spend considerable time studying words. Besides the thrill of competing, its the scrabble-bond for four days which brings players from across states and countries.

How many countries are participating in the tournament?

The Mu Sigma - International Scrabble Tournament 2020 will be the 17th International Scrabble Tournament in Bengaluru. So far participants from 12 countries have registered with players from New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, England, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Singapore, Canada and India taking part. Nigel Richards from New Zealand is the current world champion and he is also participating in this tournament. Sherwin Rodrigues who is India’s number one player will also be there. Players from age 7 to 96 would be participating in the tournament.

Could you tell us about the format of the tournament?

There are four divisions in the tournament based on player’s rankings. The top ranked players will be in Division A, and newcomers to the tournament will be in D division. 34 games will be played by every player in the A, B and C divisions over four days. 15 games will be played by players in D division over 2 days. The winners in each division would be the ones who have the most wins and have the best spread. (Spread being the difference in scores of a player and his opponent in each game). The divisions are not based on age or gender but by playing capability. Hence it is possible that a 10-year-old will play a 50 year old and beat him comfortably too.

Is there an organisation that rates Scrabble players?

The agency WESPA – World English Speaking Players Association - rates players globally. Besides that, there are various country organisations that rank players nationally, with the Indian one being the Scrabble Association of India (SAI). Scrabble is as serious as Chess. In fact many national level chess players like Manisha Mohite, Ishika S also play scrabble and are very good at it.

How many rated scrabble players do we have in India?

India has about 300 rated players. However, only the ratings of players who are active members are published on the website of Scrabble Association of India.

How many Scrabble tournaments are held in India and how many abroad?

Karnataka is the only state that organises an international tournament in India. Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa, and Delhi hold national tournaments every year. Besides these Gujarat is starting a tournament this year. Scrabble is played in more than 121 countries and in 29 languages. According to the latest WESPA calendar for 2020 besides India, USA, UK, Ireland, Australia, Malta, Malaysia, Kenya, Canada, Israel, Romania, Germany have international tournaments already listed for 2020. Besides these countries Pakistan. Sri Lanka, Nigeria and a few other countries also conduct a lot of events.

You always stress that scrabble is beyond language and vocabulary...

Scrabble is not just about vocabulary, obviously if you know more words you have an advantage. But there is more to scrabble than just that. It is a very analytical in terms of deciding what word to play or what letters to leave behind for having a better word bag more points. It’s a strategy to see where on the board one has to play a word or block the opponent from scoring to optimise your points. One has to observe the letters used and the ones available in the bag and the opponent’s rack. Scrabble is recommended for keeping dementia at bay. Obviously, concentration comes into play to ensure that you stay focussed.

Would it help if India were to declare scrabble as a sport (like Thailand and Nigeria) rather than a game?

Yes it would be good if India declares scrabble as a sport. It would get notice by the Government for promoting the game, and help generate more interest among people and sponsors to be covered by media as a sport.

How did the Bangalore Scrabble Association grow into the Karnataka State Scrabble Association?

Bangalore Scrabble Club was started in 1998 as an informal space for friends and family to get together and play. We had regular one day tournaments and in 2005 started the international tournament with help from Capgemini who were the sponsors for 15 years. There were 20-25 members in Karnataka till 2017. The Bangalore Club expanded its scope to include all of Karnataka and become the KSSA to attract more sponsors, who obviously would not support an informal organisation. We have nearly 100 members now with players from Belgaum and Bellary too.

41,2020/01/09,"Now, open bank account over video chat","Now, you will not have to physically be present at a bank branch to open a bank account. Opening an account is now allowed over a video chat with a representative of a bank branch.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to permit video-based Customer Identification Process (V-CIP) as a consent-based alternate method of establishing the customer’s identity, for customer onboarding.

RBI said the decision has been taken with a view to leveraging the digital channels. This is a giant leap for digital banking as such a facility is available only in few countries which Germany as the market leader. The demand for such a facility mainly came from tech-savvy new-age banks and prepaid payment instrument issuers, following which the government amended the Prevention of Money Laundering Rules which the banking regulator has now operationalised by amending its master direction on ‘know-your-customer’ (KYC) norms. For video-based customer authentication, PAN number and Aadhaar number will be mandatory.

“Live location of the customer [Geotagging] shall be captured to ensure that customer is physically present in India,” RBI said. Banks have to provide the facility of such audiovisual interaction.

RBI said all the regulated entities (RE) like banks should ensure that the process is a seamless, real-time, secured, end-to-end encrypted audiovisual interaction with the customer and the quality of the communication is adequate to allow identification of the customer beyond doubt.

42,2020/01/09,"Ashok Leyland, ABB arm ink pact on electric buses","Commercial vehicle manufacturer Ashok Leyland and ABB Power Products and Systems India Ltd. have entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to develop electric buses using the latter’s flash charge technology ‘TOSA.’

According to ABB Power Products, TOSA (Trolleybus Optimisation Systeme Alimentation) is the fastest flash-charging connection technology that does the topping (charging) in seconds even as passengers get on and off the buses. Besides, it reduces the environmental pollution of the transit systems without affecting passenger capacity or the journey time, said ABB Power Products and Systems India Ltd. (ABB Power Grids’ business in India) in a statement.

When connected to charging infrastructure, the batteries can be charged with a 600-kilowatt power boost in 15 seconds. An additional few minutes of charge at the final terminal would result in full recharge without interrupting the bus schedule.

TOSA can prevent 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide emission on a line covering six lakh km per year. It also offers operating cost savings of 30% compared to an equivalent diesel transit system.

ABB Power Grids’ business in India is responsible for planning, design, engineering installation and commissioning of the TOSA charging system under the MoU. Ashok Leyland will have the scope for manufacturing and supplying electrics buses compatible with TOSA technology.

According to the pact, ABB will also provide Ashok Leyland with ABB Ability Enterprise Asset Management software solution for asset optimisation as well as ABB Ability Network Manager Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems to monitor and control the power network for charging stations and e-buses.

On its part, Ashok Leyland will provide vehicle, energy and EV-related technical information using its iAlert Platform. This would further optimise maintenance processes, enable a fast response to fault incidents and better predict maintenance and performance needs. The overall solutions are equipped with remote access and ‘cloud’ capabilities and is scalable to meet future needs, according to the statement.

“We are pushing the boundaries of e-mobility with our flash-charging technology TOSA for buses to contribute to a cleaner, greener, and sustainable future,” said N. Venu, MD, ABB Power Products and Systems India Ltd. “The aim is to provide a zero local emission mass public transportation bus system with high passenger capacity,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ashok-leyland-abb-arm-ink-pact-on-electric-buses/article30526762.ece
43,2020/01/09,Allow exit for Sterling and Wilson investors: InGovern,"Proxy advisory firm InGovern has said that the capital market regulator should force Sterling and Wilson Solar, which listed on the bourses in August 2019, to give an exit option to its investors for allegedly using the public issue proceeds in a manner that was not stated in the prospectus.

According to InGovern, while the objective of the issue was to enable the promoters — belonging to the Shapoorji Pallonji Group — repay loans amounting to ₹2,563 crore taken from the company, only ₹1,000 crore had been paid till December 31, 2019.

The initial public offer (IPO) was an offer for sale by the promoters who got ₹2,850 crore through the offering.

“This is tantamount to change of objects of the IPO from what was stated in the prospectus. This has resulted in aggrieved minority public shareholders. SEBI (ICDR) Regulations, 2018 allow for the dissenting shareholders to be provided an exit offer by the promoters, in cases where there is a change in objects of the issue/ offer in the IPO prospectus,” stated the InGovern report.

The company, however, has denied making any misleading statements in its prospectus and has said that the report was “malicious, misleading, defamatory and without any attempt to ascertain the facts of the matter” from the listed firm..

“The report contains factually incorrect, misleading and unverified statements. The author of the report has acted irresponsibly as he has neither found it appropriate to ascertain the facts nor provide us with a draft of the report for our response.

44,2020/01/09,IRDAI slaps ₹1 cr. penalty on Cholamandalam MS,"IRDAI has imposed a penalty of ₹1 crore on Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Company (Chola MS) holding that the firm had violated certain provisions of corporate governance guidelines for insurers.

The trigger for the action was an analysis of 2016-17 financial statements and specifically, advance payments of about ₹115 crore made by the insurer to four entities who, IRDAI said, were corporate agents, related parties and auto original equipment manufacturers (OEM).

Chola MS said that the advances were paid towards advertisements, manpower supply and risk assessment services.

In the order, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India Chairman Subhash C. Khuntia said three of the payments — ₹22.98 crore to Ashok Leyland; ₹9.39 crore to Chola MS Risk Services and ₹40.96 crore to DHFL Sales and Services — raise concerns on whether they were genuine business transactions.

On the ₹42.47 crore paid to Chola Insurance Distribution Services Pvt. Ltd. (CIDSPL) for branding services, IRDAI observed that CIDSPL was a group company of the insurer and also a corporate agent.

Chola MS had not submitted the entity’s memorandum/articles of association.

“By making these payments… the general insurer had contravened the provisions of Paragraph 6 of Guidelines for Corporate Governance for Insurers in India, through improper use of funds from the policyholders’ account and having inadequate control over the administration of funds.

A grand showcase comprising four global unveilings, and 14 commercial and 12 passenger vehicle displays will made at the upcoming Auto Expo 2020, at Greater Noida.

The company, which entered its 75th year in 2020, said it was building a sustainable future by providing aspirational and innovative mobility solutions for a Connected India.

Second half, next fiscal

Stating that the demand for automobiles would start increasing from the second half of the next financial year, Guenter Butschek, CEO and MD, Tata Motors said, “We are ready to roll and we will showcase a strong product offering at the forthcoming Auto Expo. We are focussing on Connected, Electric, Shared and Safe mobility.”

He said the company was geared up for the BS-VI roll-out and 3,500 engineers had worked on this project and come out with new indigenous products. The company hired an additional 500 engineers for this transition and invested ₹1,200 crore in FY19. He said the company upgraded over 20 engine platforms and had come out with 100 lead vehicles with 1,000 variant upgrades.

Tata Motors is building a common Connected Vehicle Architecture, which will serve the entire portfolio across commercial, passenger and electric vehicles, to enable the ‘extended digital ecosystem’ of its customers.

The electric vehicles would support the government’s e-vision of promoting a clean and green India, he said.

To leverage the shared mobility ecosystem, Tata Motors would be providing ‘innovative solutions’ in people and goods transport.

In addition to product showcases, the Tata Motors pavilion at Auto Expo 2020 had been conceptualised and designed to provide visitors an interactive experience. As part of its sustainability mission, the company has also taken steps such as going paperless and increasing the green cover at the pavilion.

Keeping the growing start-up culture in mind, Tata Motors would use this platform to also crowdsource and engage with the start-up communities, he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ur973r/article30526735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBUTATA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tata-motors-sees-demand-recovery-in-fy21/article30526736.ece

47,2020/01/09,"60 listed firms disclose ₹75,000 cr. default","A directive by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for companies to disclose loan defaults at the end of every quarter has led to almost 60 listed entities disclosing a cumulative default amount of almost ₹75,000 crore as on December 31.

More importantly, there are nine companies that have defaulted on loans worth more than ₹1,000 crore each even as bulk of the overall default amount pertains to companies belonging to the Anil Ambani Group.

As per stock exchange disclosures, Anil Ambani Group companies such as Reliance Communications, Reliance Naval & Engineering, Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power have defaulted on loans totalling a little more than ₹43,800 crore as on December 31, 2019.

Within the group, Reliance Communications accounts for a chunk of the portion at ₹32,575 crore.

The default amount includes both loans from banks and financial institutions along with unlisted debt securities such as non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and non- convertible redeemable preference shares (NCRPS).

Other names

Apart from these entities, well-known names like Suzlon Energy, Jaypee Infratech, Ansal Housing, Aban Offshore, ISMT, Religare Enterprises, Bedmutha Industries, Hindustan Construction and Bombay Rayon Fashions also feature in the first list of such defaulters.

“The information itself is not as startling as one should make it out to be as these are names of companies which have been down under for quite some time and many of them would already be under various stages either in IBC or NCLT,” said Arun Kejriwal of Kejriwal Research & Investment Services.

“Going forward, when this list appears every quarter, it would be interesting to observe any new entrants during the quarter, which should raise the alarm bells.” he added. In November 2019, the capital market regulator mandated companies to disclose any default in the case of loans from banks and financial institutions wherein the default continued beyond 30 days.

Further, such disclosures have to be made within seven days from the end of every quarter.

Interestingly, experts are of the view that since such disclosures will be made every quarter, exchanges should endeavour to present a consolidated list of such defaulters for the benefit of the investor community.

“Default is a price-sensitive information and what has been disclosed is not some temporary default and hence, investors need to be informed so that they can take better informed decision in terms of investing,” said J. N. Gupta, founder, Stakeholder Empowerment Services, a proxy advisory firm.

“However, since this information will be disseminated after every quarter, exchanges should compile a list and present a consolidated report of all defaulters on their website for all investors to access,” added Mr. Gupta.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jteu0v/article26548185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16RCOM-DEBT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/60-listed-firms-disclose-75000-cr-default/article30526706.ece

50,2020/01/09,Banks plan to sell DHFL’s assets in three lots,"Lenders to the troubled mortgage financier Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd. (DHFL) are planning to sell the assets in three parts for which separate bids will be invited.

In a recent interaction with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)-appointed administrators of DHFL, bankers suggested that the assets should be sold in three lots — retail home loans, non-retail loans and slum rehabilitation project loans.

Typically housing finance companies extend retail loans (loans to individual home buyers) and non-retail loans (which are loans to companies and developers).

DHFL has also extended loans for slum rehabilitation projects. DHFL’s total loan portfolio is in the order of ₹85,000 crore and the borrowings are almost similar. Bankers said they expect good value for the sale of retail loans that comprises 40-45% of the loan book.

Chances of a significant haircut will arise from loans extended for construction of slum rehabilitation projects, bankers said.

“Someone may be interested in retail loans and some other bidder, in developer loans,” said the chief executive of a bank on the proposal to sell loans in three parts.

“This is the best possible solution,” the person said.

The RBI had initiated the process of resolution of DHFL under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the case had been admitted in the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).

“Now, the committee of creditors (CoC) will take a call on whether to sell the assets in three lots,” said a senior official from a public sector bank.

If CoC approves the plan, three separate expressions of interest will be floated for sale of the assets.

After DHFL started to default on banks loans, the RBI, on November 20, superseded the board of DHFL and appointed an administrator. Subsequently, the banking regulator filed an application for initiation of corporate insolvency resolution process against the mortgage financier on November 29, 2019.

Banks’ exposure to the troubled mortgage financier is almost ₹40,000 crore while DHFL’s total debt is about ₹80,000 crore.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/y6d7my/article30526680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THBUDHFL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/banks-plan-to-sell-dhfls-assets-in-three-lots/article30526681.ece
51,2020/01/09,Uber hails new safety features,"Uber on Thursday announced new safety features such as PIN verification for starting trips, RideCheck to keep a tab on certain trip irregularities as well as the option of recording audio while on-trip.

Uber’s rival in India Ola offers two of these features — one-time password to begin trips and ‘Guardian,’ a real-time monitoring system that analyses indicators such as route deviations and unexpected and midway stops.

With the PIN verification, riders will receive a four-digit code that they need to provide to drivers to begin the trip. “We are also working on advanced technologies that will in future use ultrasound waves to automatically transmit the safety PIN for verifying rides,” said Sachin Kansal, senior director of global safety products, Uber.

The RideCheck feature will enable the company to flag certain trip irregularities such as long, unexpected stops or midway drops that might indicate an increased safety risk, especially for women. “If an anomaly is detected, Uber will initiate a RideCheck by reaching out to both the rider and the driver,” the company said.

Uber will be piloting audio recording in India this year. It will give an option to both the rider and the driver to record audio through their phone while on-trip. When the trip ends, the user will have an option to report a safety incident and submit the audio recording.

“The audio file shall be encrypted and the user cannot listen in to the stored recording on their device, but may choose to send it to Uber’s customer support agents who will use the audio to help better understand an incident and take appropriate actions. Only Uber will have access to the audio once the user submits it,” the company added.

Mr. Kansal said, “...we [are] working towards introducing audio recording in India as a pilot this year and roll-out the RideCheck feature for long stop and midway drop-offs. We have been piloting and refining these features in different markets globally to ensure they work well for both our riders and driver partners.

52,2020/01/09,Japanese shares bounce back after U.S.-Iran anxiety eases,"Japanese shares surged on Thursday, recovering all the losses from the previous session, after the United States and Iran signalled their desire to avoid further military conflict.

At 0214 GMT, the Nikkei index was up 1.88% at 23,640.87. It erased Wednesday's 1.57% decline, triggered by Iranian missile attacks on facilities hosting U.S. military forces in Iraq in retaliation to the U.S. killing of a prominent Iranian general last week.

The attack initially roiled global financial markets as it stoked fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East.

However, markets regained their composure after U.S. President Donald Trump said there were no casualties and the United States did not necessarily have to hit back.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also said the missile strike “concluded” Tehran's response to the U.S. killing last week of Qassem Soleimani, who was responsible for building Iran's network of proxy armies across the Middle East.

The technology and industrial sectors led the advance as shares of electric parts maker Omron Corp and industrial robot maker Fanuc Corp rose.

There were 217 advancers on the Nikkei index against seven decliners on Thursday.

The largest percentage gainers in the index were semiconductor manufacturing equipment maker Screen Holdings Co Ltd up 6.66%, followed by photography and medical device maker Fujifilm Holdings Corp gaining 5.71% and technology investor SoftBank Group Corp up by 4.91%.

The largest percentage losers in the index were oil and natural gas developer Inpex Corp down 3.45%, followed by oil refiner JXTG Holdings Inc losing 2.67%, and engineering company JGC Holdings Corp down by 1.27%.

53,2020/01/09,Forest Committee approves scheme to ‘trade’ in forests,"The Forest Advisory Committee, an apex body tasked with adjudicating requests by the industry to raze forest land for commercial ends, has approved a scheme that could allow “forests” to be traded as a commodity. If implemented, it allows the Forest Department to outsource one of its responsibilities of reforesting to non-government agencies.

In the current system, industry needs to make good the loss of forest by finding appropriate non-forest land — equal to that which would be razed. It also must pay the State Forest Department the current economic equivalent — called Net Present Value — of the forest land. It’s then the Forest Department’s responsibility to grow appropriate vegetation that, over time, would grow into forests.

Industries have often complained that they find it hard to acquire appropriate non-forest land, which has to be contiguous to existing forest. Nearly ₹50,000 crore had been collected by the Centre over decades, but the funds were lying unspent because States were not spending the money on regrowing forests. The Supreme Court intervened, a new law came about with rules for how this fund was to be administered. About ₹47,000 crore had been disbursed to States until August, but it has barely led to any rejuvenation of forests.

‘Green Credit Scheme’

The proposed ‘Green Credit Scheme’, as it is called, allows agencies — they could be private companies, village forest communities — to identify land and begin growing plantations. After three years, they would be eligible to be considered as compensatory forest land if they met the Forest Department’s criteria. An industry needing forest land could then approach the agency and pay it for parcels of such forested land, and this would then be transferred to the Forest Department and be recorded as forest land.

“The participating agency will be free to trade its asset, that is plantation, in parcels, with project proponents who need forest land,” say the minutes of the meeting held on December 19, but which have just been made public. This is not the first time that such a scheme has been mooted. In 2015, a ‘Green Credit Scheme’ for degraded forest land with public-private participation was recommended, but it was not approved by the Union Environment Minister, the final authority.

‘Individuals outside’

“The FAC believes that such a scheme will encourage plantation by individuals outside the traditional forest area and will help in meeting international commitments such as sustainable development goals and nationally determined contributions,” the minutes note.

One of India’s prongs to combat climate change is the Green India Mission that aims to sequester 2.523 billion tonnes of carbon by 2020-30, and this involves adding 30 million hectares in addition to existing forest. “It does not solve the core problems of compensatory afforestation,” Kanchi Kohli, who is with the Centre for Policy Research and investigates forest rights, told The Hindu. “It creates problems of privatising multi-use forest areas as monoculture plantation plots. Forests are treated as a mere commodity without any social or ecological character.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/rlxlpq/article30527153.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MASHOLAFORESTDGL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/forest-committee-approves-scheme-to-trade-in-forests/article30527065.ece
54,2020/01/09,Teenager in hit-and-run to be tried as ‘child’: Supreme Court,"A loophole in the juvenile law will see a teenager who allegedly drove his father’s luxury car over a 32-year-old man in Delhi being tried as a child rather than an adult who has committed a heinous crime.

A Supreme Court Bench led by Justice Deepak Gupta on Thursday used its extraordinary powers under Article 142 of the Constitution to declare that a juvenile above 16 years of age, who commits an offence for which the Indian Penal Code (IPC) prescribes a maximum prison sentence of more than seven years but for which the minimum sentence provided is less than seven years or even no minimum jail term, should be tried as a “child” under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. In such cases, a juvenile will not be tried as an adult in a regular court of law under the Code of Criminal Procedure.

That is, crimes committed by a juvenile between 16 and 18 years of age with a maximum prison sentence of seven years or above, but with no minimum sentence or less than seven years minimum sentence prescribed, would not be treated as ‘heinous’ crimes.

They would only be tried as “serious” offences under the Juvenile Justice Act till Parliament amends the statute to fill the “unfortunate gap”, the apex court said.

The 2015 Act was enacted after the juvenile involved in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder saw reduced punishment while his fellow accused faced the death penalty. The juvenile law was amended to categorise crimes committed by minors into three - ‘petty’ offences with a maximum jail term of three years; ‘serious’ offences with a prison sentence of up to seven years; and ‘heinous’ offences like rape, murder and terrorism with a minimum prison sentence of seven years and above. In heinous offences, a juvenile above 16 years of age could be tried like an adult and even punished with life imprisonment or death penalty.

Justice Gupta however concluded that the 2015 Act made a “gross mistake” by not taking into account a fourth category of offences under the IPC.

These were offences like counterfeiting and homicide not amounting to murder - as in the present case - for which the maximum punishment was seven years or above and for which no minimum sentence is prescribed or a less than seven-year minimum sentence was provided under the IPC.

The court declared that these fourth category of crimes cannot be treated as heinous crimes under Section 2(33) of the 2015 Act. They have to be tried as ‘serious offences’ before a Juvenile Justice Board and not a regular court of law till the Parliament takes a call. The court justified that it cannot turn the vacuum in the law against children.

In the present case, the juvenile, who was aged over 16 at the time of the alleged crime, was charged under Section 304 of the IPC (homicide not amounting to murder), which is punished with a maximum sentence of life sentence or 10 years but for which no minimum sentence is prescribed.

Hence, the apex court decided that the crime should not be tried as a heinous one under the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The number of murders due to “political reason” in West Bengal stood at 12, followed by nine in Bihar and seven in Maharashtra. In all, 54 political murders were reported in the country in 2018. In 2017, the number of such cases stood at 98.

The data are not in consonance with an advisory sent by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to the West Bengal government last year. In an advisory sent on June 15, the MHA had said political violence in West Bengal had claimed 96 lives and that the “unabated violence” over the years was a matter of deep concern.

The NCRB said the clarifications on data were pending from West Bengal, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Sikkim, hence data might be treated as provisional.

Casteism the motive

As per the report, “casteism” was the motive of murder in 36 cases, with maximum such cases reported from Uttar Pradesh — 13 and Karnataka 9. As many as 26 people were killed due to religious and communal reasons and the highest number of such killings was reported from Bihar (12), according to the NCRB report.

Eighteen persons were killed and 277 injured in police firing and police lathicharge in 2018, the figure stood at 34 and 492 in the year 2017. Those killed in police encounters stood at 36 and 35 such deaths were recorded in Jammu and Kashmir. In all, 89 cases of human rights violations were reported against the police and 40 policemen were arrested.

As many as 10,133 cases of unlawful assembly and 57,828 incidents of rioting were reported in 2018.

Agrarian causes led to 2008 such riots while 1,495 such incidents occurred due to political reasons and 512 owing to religious reasons.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bengal-tops-in-political-murders/article30526944.ece
56,2020/01/09,Uttar Pradesh tops list in crimes against women,"The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) published the annual Crime in India Report 2018 on Wednesday. It was published with provisional data, as five States — West Bengal, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya and Sikkim — did not send clarifications sought by the NCRB despite repeated reminders.

The 2017 annual crime report was published on October 21 last year, after a delay of two years.

According to the report, 3,78,277 cases of crime against women were reported in the country, up from 3,59,849 in 2017. Uttar Pradesh topped the list with 59,445 cases, followed by Maharashtra (35,497) and West Bengal (30,394). The conviction rate in rape-related cases stood at 27.2% even though the rate of filing chargesheets was 85.3% in such cases.

Cruelty by husband or his relatives (31.9%) followed by assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty (27.6%) constituted the major share of crimes against women, the report said.

A total of 50,74,634 cognisable crimes — 31,32,954 Indian Penal Code (IPC) crimes and 19,41,680 Special & Local Laws (SLL) crimes — were registered in 2018, showing an increase of 1.3% in registration of cases compared to 2017 (50,07,044 cases).

Suicides report

The NCRB also released the Accidental Death and Suicides in India 2018 report, which said that 10,349 people working in the farm sector ended their lives in 2018, accounting for 7.7 % of the total number of suicides in the country. There were 5,763 farmers/cultivators and 4,586 agricultural labourers among those who ended their lives. The total number of people who committed suicide in 2018 was 1,34,516, an increase of 3.6% from 2017 when 1,29,887 cases were reported. The highest number of suicide victims were daily wagers — 26,589, comprising 22.4% of such deaths.

The majority of the suicides were reported in Maharashtra (17,972) followed by Tamil Nadu (13,896), West Bengal (13,255), Madhya Pradesh (11,775) and Karnataka (11,561)

Many States and Union Territories have reported nil data on suicides by farmers, cultivators and farm labourers. “West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Meghalaya, Goa, Chandigarh, Daman & Diu, Delhi, Lakshadweep and Puducherry reported zero suicides by farmers/cultivators as well as agricultural labourers,” the NCRB report said.

58,2020/01/09,"India doesn’t need CAA, NPR, NRIC, say over 100 former bureaucrats in open letter","Over 100 former bureaucrats in an open letter on Thursday have said there was no need for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC), adding that they had “grave reservations” about the constitutional validity of provisions of the CAA.

In the letter addressed to fellow citizens, 106 former officials, including ambassadors and secretaries to the government of India, who form the thinktank Constitutional Conduct, have demanded the repeal of the CAA.

Passed in December, the law fast-tracks citizenship for Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, Hindu and Christian migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, leaving out Muslims.

Among the signatories to the letter are former Delhi L-G Najeeb Jung, ex-Cabinet Secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar, former Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah and former Foreign Secretary and National Security Advisor Shivshankar Menon.

The letter says the NPR had nothing to do with the Census, which is conducted every 10 years and is due in 2021. It points out that the NPR and the NRIC exercises arose out of amendments to the Citizenship Act, 1955 in 2003 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.

“We fail to understand the need for a nationwide identification of ‘illegal migrants’, which is what the NRIC in effect amounts to, when Census statistics over the past seven decades do not show any major demographic shifts, except in certain pockets in some areas of Northeastern and Eastern India adjoining our neighbouring countries,” the letter states.

The former bureaucrats also expressed apprehensions about the powers to be given to the local registrar, a relatively junior level officer, to decide whether a person is included or excluded from the local register of Indian citizens.

“The provisions of the CAA, coupled with rather aggressive statements over the past few years from the highest levels of this government, rightly cause deep unease in India’s Muslim community...” they said.

Stating that the NPR would be an inconvenience to people as well as unnecessary expenditure for the country, the letter also questioned the authorisation of setting up Foreigners’ Tribunals and detention camps.

On the CAA, the letter says: “We have our grave reservations about the constitutional validity of the CAA provisions, which we also consider to be morally indefensible. A formulation that focused on those suffering persecution [religious, political, social] in any country in the world would not only have calmed local apprehensions but would also have been appreciated by the international community.”

The former officials said that since the government has the discretion to grant citizenship and give exemptions from the Passport Act, 1920, and Foreigners Act, 1946, it could have exercised it, without passing the CAA.

The letter also point out that while Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on December 22 that the NRC and CAA were not linked, Home Minister Amit Shah has said on “repeated occasions” that they are connected.

“In such a welter of conflicting and confusing utterances, it is hardly surprising that the ordinary citizen is left bewildered and is overcome by unknown fears, more so when government has not entered into any dialogue on this issue,” the letter says.

Demanding the repeal of sections of the Citizenship Act pertaining to the issue of national identity cards and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 altogether, the formers bureaucrats have urged the government to withdraw the Foreigners (Tribunals) Amendment Order, 2019, and all instructions for construction of detention camps.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7bkb33/article30415354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CAAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-doesnt-need-caa-npr-nric-say-over-100-former-bureaucrats-in-open-letter/article30526821.ece
59,2020/01/09,"Gandhi’s non-violence is the only way forward, says Sharad Pawar","Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) president Sharad Pawar has called for opposing the Central government’s dictatorial policies with Mahatma Gandhi’s way of non-violence.

“What happened at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is being condemned across the country. The government’s dictatorship needs to be answered with Gandhiji’s way of non-violence,” Mr. Pawar said on Thursday, adding the violence at JNU has hurt sentiments of the students’ community.

He was speaking after flagging off the ‘Gandhi Shanti Yatra’ started by former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the JNU violence, at the Gateway of India. The programme was attended by Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) leader Prakash Amabedkar, who is known for his anti-NCP stand.

Mr. Pawar, referring to the anti-CAA protests, said a big section of society is feeling disappointed with the government. “Some steps taken by the Centre have given a jolt to the country’s unity. Members of some sections of society feel their interests are not being protected.”

The NCP chief said there are members of several sections, including the minorities, who cannot tell where they came from and where they would live. “They will be forced to live in camps. The government has left representatives of the Independent India and shareholders of the country disappointed,” he said.

The government needs to be shown the right path of Gandhi’s non-violent way, which only can help save the Constitution, Mr. Pawar said.

Mr. Sinha said, “We will protect the Constitution drafted by Ambedkarji. We will not let the country be partitioned again. We will not let Gandhi be murdered again. We are all one and will remain one.”

Congress leader Ashish Deshmukh, who also participated in the yatra, reiterated his demand that the Maharashtra government remove all those vice-chancellors from State universities who have links with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and were appointed during the previous Devendra Fadnavis-led regime.

He alleged that whatever happened at JNU was because the university administration has people who follow the ideology of the RSS.

Mr. Deshmukh said JNU Vice-Chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar, too, is believed to be following the RSS ideology. “So, to avoid any JNU-like incident in Maharashtra universities, the government should remove the vice-chancellors who have RSS links.”

Jaishankar here on Thursday.

The visit by the Sri Lankan Minister, his first visit abroad after taking charge, comes after the visit by Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in November as “a follow up” to his discussions with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“The Sri Lankan Foreign Minister reiterated the importance laid by President Rajapaksa on exploring newer areas of cooperation with India with emphasis on skill development, vocational training and capacity building and requested India’s support,” the Ministry of External Affairs said, laying emphasis on skilling and opportunities for people-to-people ties.

Mr. Gunawardena also met Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Mahendra Nath Pandey, and Minister of State for Labour and Employment Santosh Kumar Gangwar.

However, officials declined to comment on whether the meeting with the new Sri Lankan Foreign Minister had discussed taking forward some of the commitments made by the previous Sri Lankan government on infrastructure projects in Trincomalee and Colombo as well as the Northern region, or about taking forward the Economic and Technical Cooperation (ETCA) preferential trade agreement talks that have been stalled for several years.

According to the MEA the ministers also discussed issues of climate change and terrorism.

In a tweet after the meeting Mr. Jaishankar said he had “productive discussions” with his counterpart on “bilateral issues and regional concerns”. In response Mr. Gunawardena described the discussions as “cordial”.

61,2020/01/09,Protesters will throw CAA in BJP govt’s face if it doesn’t back down: ex-IAS officer,"Protesters would throw the CAA, NPR and the proposed nationwide NRC in the face of the BJP government at the Centre, which will have to take it without any dignity, if it didn’t back down, said former IAS officer Sasikanth Senthil.

Mr. Senthil called upon the government to see the protests across the country as the “real India”. He said, “You refer to mera desh [my country] in so many of your speeches; well this is it. Understand the sentiments of people, and save yourself some modesty before it’s too late.”

Mr. Senthil, who quit as the Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner in September, as the “building blocks of democracy” were being “compromised”, hailed students’ leadership in protests, which inspired him to join a dharna at the Iqbal Maidan in Bhopal on Thursday.

“This country is not like [former] Italy or Germany where governments could control everybody with their fascist frameworks. This country will stand and fight in a democratic way,” he said.

The agitations were reminiscent of the Freedom struggle, he said. Wherever he went, people “held the Constitution, stood under the Tricolour and shouted Jai Bhim.”

Remarkably, he said, those in the government would remember the protests for the lifetime, as they had planned to carry forward anti-people policies in the second term, and couldn't fathom any opposition.

“Yet it has no clue what is happening, nor can it control protests. Since 2014, their trajectory has been completely anti-people. They have not done even a single thing that would take the country to a different level. Their formula is division and take votes,” he alleged.

As for a Hindu rashtra, he said that not 10, 100 but “it’ll not be possible even in a thousand years... In the Jawaharlal Nehru University, you unleashed your gundas against students. The more you oppress, the more resistance there will be.”

Asking people to protest peacefully and in an intelligent way, he said hitting the streets was a democratic right without a question of its legality. “Civil disobedience is the way we chased the British away,” he said.

Mr. Senthil exhorted civil servants to stick to constitutional tenets. “It’s a very easy psychological concept of the authority directing and subordinates conforming. There will be a point when the civil society and civil servants will put their foot down,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ys3q6c/article30266698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20191210Senthil1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/protesters-will-throw-caa-in-bjp-govts-face-if-it-doesnt-back-down-ex-ias-officer/article30526002.ece
62,2020/01/09,Vital to retain strategic heights of Siachen: Army Chief,"India needs to retain control of the strategic heights of the Siachen Glacier as they are vital to the country’s defences in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Army Chief General Manoj Naravane said on Thursday.

“It is a strategically important location at the very head of our defences and it is absolutely important to remain ever vigilant and in control of these strategic heights because they form the key to the rest of the defences in Ladakh and the rest of Jammu and Kashmir,” Gen. Naravane said on his maiden visit to the Glacier since assuming charge as the Chief of Amy Staff on December 31.

Acknowledging that all personnel deployed there were operating in very tough conditions, given the inhospitable terrain and weather, Gen. Naravane said, “We are doing our best to make sure that whatever is required by the troops is made available to them including clothing and better rations.”

Weather is the biggest enemy on the glacier and more soldiers have lost their lives due to weather related incidents than enemy fire.

India has been holding the dominating heights on the Siachen glacier since it occupied them in 1984 during Operation Meghdoot. While there are transit camps after the Base Camp, the actual posts are located at altitudes of 18,000 feet and above with the Bana post being the highest on the glacier, at close to 22,000 feet. At 18,000-19,000 feet, Indian and Pakistani posts face each other.

63,2020/01/09,JNU student activists say police in civvies were on campus during violence,"Plain-clothes police personnel were on the JNU campus when students were assaulted by an armed gang, student activists said. Eyewitnesses maintained that they spotted a large collection of armed men with faces covered in handkerchiefs stationed outside the Periyar hostel and policemen in civil dresses were standing nearby when the mob began pelting stones at students.

“Our first response was to run as we were hit on our legs with flying bricks. But after a while we returned to the Periyar main gate, and there we saw a collection of men who were not masked and armed but were stationed there. So we asked them who they were and they responded that they were from Delhi Police,"" said Sucheta Talukdar, a student councillor of the All India Students Association and a student of the Centre for Historical Studies (CHS).

The narrative goes counter to the reported claim that the police were asked to be stationed at the entry gates of the campus and therefore were not in a position to stop the violence by the armed gang. The students indicate that the police were present on the campus to incite and participate in violence.

“We were agitated and asked why were they just standing and not stopping the gang that still could be heard hollering nearby. But they kept standing there,” said Ms. Talukdar. The role of the police during the night of assault deserves closer scrutiny as some other students said that the police in civil dress were not only mute witness but in fact assaulted students near the North Gate.

“Students identified the persons in plainclothes that they were indeed from Delhi Police and around 7 p.m. of January 5, they assaulted students near the North Gate,” said a PhD student who witnessed the violence near the North Gate, which is the main entrance of the university and near the Periyar and Ganga hostels. Students maintain that it was because of the presence of the plain-clothes policemen that the violence was intense from the side of the gang.

“I was beaten up by police during our anti-fee hike agitation but the presence of cops on the campus was a form of incitement for targeting students,” said Ms. Talukdar.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bk0qfk/article30488996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-STUDENTPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-student-activists-say-police-in-civvies-were-on-campus-during-violence/article30525722.ece

Making the announcement on Twitter, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath said, “This film, besides sending across a positive message on acid [attack] women survivors, is based on a tale of self-confidence, struggle, hope and the will to survive despite the pain.”

The film, due to release on January 10, “is based on the message of bringing about a change in society’s thinking regarding the issue,” Mr. Nath added.

“You should watch it with your family, and make yourself and society aware,” Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel also tweeted.

The film would help make society aware of heinous crimes like acid attacks on women, Mr. Baghel noted, elaborating on the State government’s rationale for deciding to make it tax-free.

66,2020/01/09,PM Modi to re-dedicate three restored colonial structures to Kolkata,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is scheduled to visit Kolkata later this week, will “re-dedicate three recently restored iconic buildings” to the people of Kolkata, a senior official of the Ministry of Culture said on Thursday.

“Currency Building, Meltcalfe Hall and Belvedre House are the heritage buildings that have been restored and made vibrant with the intervention of the Ministry of Culture,” Raghvendra Singh, CEO of Development of Museums and Cultural Spaces, Government of India, and Vice-Chancellor, National Museum Institute, told The Hindu.

Cultural spaces

“This is just the beginning. The people of Kolkata, once they get back these buildings, have to own and make use of these cultural spaces. For instance, if you want to organise an exhibition, a theatre festival or a music festival, these are right places at right locations,” Mr. Singh, former secretary, Ministry of Culture, said. He said that Kolkata, the cultural capital of the country, was in dire need of such cultural spaces.

Located in the heart of the Dalhousie area, the Currency Building was built in 1833, designed in the Italian style with regal Venetian windows and cast iron gates, and housed one of earliest banks in the country. Till 1937, the building was occupied by the Reserve Bank of India, after which it slipped into neglect. In the early years of the millennium, there was a proposal to bring the building down and construct a multi-storey structure in its place. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) took over the Currency Building in 2002 and later declared it a protected monument.

‘Completely restored’

“Much of the restoration work of the building has been done over the last two financial years. It has been completely restored and is now ready to house exhibitions on art and culture,” Shubha Majumder, Superintending Archaeologist, Kolkata Circle of the ASI, said. The Currency Building is all set to host an exhibition titled ‘Ghare Baire’ (‘The World, The Home and Beyond’) on 18th-20th century art in Bengal, which has been commissioned by the Ministry of Culture, and organised and curated by the Delhi-based DAG and the National Gallery of Modern Art (NGMA).

The Metcalfe Hall, another majestic colonial building located about 200 metres from the Currency Building, was restored by early 2019. “The building, which draws its name from Lord Metcalfe, Governor General of India from March 1835 to March 1836, is housing an exhibition ‘Ami Kolkata’, on the people of Kolkata,” Mr. Majumder said. The building was conceptualised as a public library that was built between 1840-1844, and is a majestic monument with 30 Corinthian pillars.

The third building, Belvedere House, in the campus of the National Library, was also facing neglect, and has been restored. Belvedre House has housed Governors of Bengal and Viceroys of India, and was Mir Jafar’s palace before that.

“The building is housing the paintings of Elizabeth Bruner, and on 100 years of Santiniketan, and also some old photographs of Kolkata by painters like Raja Deen Dayal,” Mr. Singh said. According to officials, the Prime Minister is likely to participate in an event organised by the Ministry of Culture on the evening of January 11 at the Currency Building.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yxm1jv/article30525332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/045-Metcalfe-Hall-Stand-Road-Kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pm-to-re-dedicate-three-restored-colonial-structures-to-kolkata/article30525333.ece
67,2020/01/09,"Modi govt policies hampering India’s economic growth, foreign policy: risk firm","India has been ranked the 5th highest “Geopolitical Risk” in 2020, according to a list of 10 global risks in the year ahead, compiled by the Eurasia Group, a leading global political risk management consultancy. It said that in its second term, the Narendra Modi-led NDA government’s “social” policies were affecting India’s economic agenda and foreign policy image.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi has spent much of his second term promoting controversial social policies at the expense of an economic agenda. The impacts will be felt in 2020, with intensified communal and sectarian instability, as well as foreign policy and economic setbacks,” said the report entitled “Top Risks 2020”, co-authored by Ian Bremmer and Cliff Kupchan of the Eurasia Group, pointing to the widening fiscal deficit, low GST collections, and the latest six-year low in GDP growth.

The report was released this week even as Mr. Modi began a series of meetings with businessmen and economists ahead of the annual Budget announcement, in an effort to shore up the economy.

Amongst the other risks listed for 2020 are U.S. governance and institutional conflicts with President Donald Trump, the U.S.-China trade rift, European geopolitics, Climate change, and Turkey.

What makes the Eurasia Group listing significant is that this is the first time in many years that India has been mentioned for social and political developments. The group had referred to India mostly due to its economic potential in the past. In 2016, for example, the Eurasia report on top global risks said that Mr. Modi’s “strong leadership… focused on economic reform and longer-term strategy” would actually reduce geopolitical risks.

Mr. Bremmer, who is the founder and president of the Eurasia Group, has also in the past been a major supporter of reforms under the Modi government, and praised him in several articles and television appearances since 2014. In June 2019, Mr. Bremmer wrote for Time magazine that Mr. Modi was “India’s best bet for economic reform”.

“It really shifted with the election,” Mr. Bremmer told The Hindu, when asked about the shift in his opinion. “[Mr.] Modi’s need to win while the economy was softening led him to deprioritise reform and turn to Hindu nationalism and the RSS.

68,2020/01/09,JNU violence: BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi seeks Vice-Chancellor Jagadesh Kumar’s ouster,"Senior BJP leader and former Human Resource Development (HRD) Minister Murli Manohar Joshi on January 9 sought the removal of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar for failing to implement the Ministry’s proposal to settle the fee increase issue.

“There are reports that the Ministry had twice advised the Vice-Chancellor to implement certain reasonable and working formula for resolving the issue of enhanced fees... He was also advised to reach out to the teachers and the students. It is shocking that the Vice-Chancellor is adamant in not implementing the proposal. This attitude is deplorable and, in my opinion, such a Vice-Chancellor should not be allowed to continue,” Dr. Joshi wrote on his verified Twitter handle.

He made these comments after reports emerged that Mr. Kumar had been presented with, and refused to implement, a compromise formula between the Ministry and the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union (JNUSU), of which members were striking against the proposed increase in tuition, mess and utility fees.

This increased the tensions between the administration and the JNUSU, culminating into the January 5 attack on the campus by masked intruders, which left several students and a faculty member injured.

69,2020/01/09,End to captive coal mining will be disastrous: CITU,"The Union Cabinet’s decision on Wednesday to end captive coal mining would be disastrous for the industries concerned including steel, power and aluminum, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) said in a statement on Thursday.

Terming the decision ‘retrograde’, it said the decision to promulgate an ordinance to amend two laws concerning mining would remove the restriction of end-use so that foreign and domestic bidders for mine blocks could convert the natural resources into items for trade and export.

The CITU said the decision would also affect the viability of the Coal India Ltd. as 100% FDI in coal mining would be allowed.

“Excuses being made by the government that this decision will reduce coal import is totally untenable and illusory. Rather this is going to expand the grip and control of foreign players with Indian private contractors as their junior partners, on the country’s vital mineral resources, much to the detriment of our national interests,” the statement said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9h5d1j/article30525110.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COALMINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/end-to-captive-coal-mining-will-be-disastrous-citu/article30525111.ece

With about two months to go for the mega event, the preparations were reviewed at the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) by Vice Admiral SN Ghormade, Chief of Staff ENC, on Thursday along with the civil administration and all stakeholder organisations, it said.

“A detailed presentation to apprise the attendees of the planned activities of Milan was conducted followed by site visits to various venues by the nodal officers from the Navy and the attendees representing stakeholder organisations towards drawing out time bound action plans,” the Navy said in a statement. Visakhapatnam had earlier hosted the International Fleet Review (IFR) in February 2016.

The exercise with the theme “Synergy Across the Seas” would provide an excellent opportunity for Operational Commanders of friendly foreign navies to interact with one another in areas of mutual interest, it said.

Milan 2020 is a week-long multilateral exercise aimed at enhancing professional interaction and learn from one an other’s strengths and best practices in the maritime domain.

71,2020/01/09,Supreme Court to rule on legality of J&K restrictions today,"The Supreme Court will on January 10 pronounce its verdict on the legality of the restrictions on the fundamental freedom of movement and the shut-down of communications in Jammu and Kashmir since August 5 last.

Also Read In a land without Internet: How the communication blackout is forcing young entrepreneurs out of Kashmir Valley

The judgment is authored by Justice N.V. Ramana.

The clamp-down followed the revocation of the special right and privileges enjoyed by the Kashmiri people under Article 370 and the bifurcation of the erstwhile State into the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

Anuradha Bhasin, the petitioner and Editor of The Kashmir Times, said the restrictions had crippled the freedom of the press, essential services and even communications between families, bringing untold miseries to the people. A pall of suspicion was cast on the entire seven million people, who lived in a state of imprisonment. Restrictive orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC) were issued without application of mind, she said.

However, before a three-judge Bench led by Justice Ramana, the Jammu and Kashmir government had maintained that normalcy had returned to the Valley and the people were happy. The government dismissed Ms. Bhasin’s claims as mere hyperbole.

Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta, for the Jammu and Kashmir government, had claimed that the authorities acted on heaps of material, including intelligence and military, about inflammatory material and speeches, circulation of fake news, morphed images and videos spread on social media.

The court’s view on the right to access to the Internet, especially when its restriction affects livelihood, needs to be seen.

Mr. Mehta had acknowledged that access to Internet was, indeed, a part of the fundamental right to free speech, but warned that “modern terrorism relies heavily on the Internet”. On the last day of the hearing, Mr. Mehta had justified that “terror views social media as its most effective weapon. Terror is global”. “So is human rights,” senior lawyer Vrinda Grover, for Ms. Bhasin, had retorted immediately.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fkkjd0/article30526409.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TH-SRINAGARjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article-370-supreme-court-to-pass-verdicts-on-pleas-challenging-curbs-in-j-k-tomorrow/article30524952.ece
72,2020/01/09,JNU students beaten up during march,"Several students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Thursday were beaten up by Delhi Police personnel as they tried to march towards Rashtrapati Bhavan after “unsatisfactory” talks with officials of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MoHRD). At least four students received injuries when police used “mild force” to disperse the march. Around 11 students were also detained but later released.

Scores of people had assembled since late afternoon outside the HRD Ministry as a protest march starting from Mandi House culminated there. HRD Secretary Amit Khare met a delegation of nine representatives from JNU Students’ Union and JNU Teachers Association demanding the removal of Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar.

‘Resolving issues’

The Ministry ruled out Mr. Kumar’s removal. “Removing the V-C is not the solution. The basic issue on which the whole problem has arisen needs to be addressed first. Changing X, Y or Z is not as important as resolving the issues that have come up,” said Mr. Khare.

Around 100 students have been detained by Delhi Police as they tried to march towards Rashtrapati Bhavan, in New Delhi on January 9, 2020.

Ministry officials, however, asserted that the “formula” decided during consultations with students and administration needs to be implemented. University officials, including the Vice- Chancellor, have been called at the Ministry on Friday over students’ claims that the revised fees, as decided during the MoHRD’s intervention, are not being implemented.

Towards evening, JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Aishe Ghosh addressed those gathered outside Shastri Bhawan and termed the MoHRD meeting “unsatisfactory” and called for a march to Rashtrapati Bhavan. Students and protesters started moving but were stopped by the police. In the melee, several protesters were beaten up by the police and taken away in police vehicles. A male student suffered head injuries during a baton charge.

Thousands gather

Earlier, several political leaders and activists addressed a crowd of thousands of people, including ordinary citizens, students and professors from various universities outside Shastri Bhawan, while talks were going on inside.

“No resignation, he [the V-C] has to be removed. For three hours, he allowed a rampage on campus despite the police being present outside. They were only called in when it was over. This can only mean that the V-C is also complicit in the incident,” said Communist Party of India-Marxist leader Sitaram Yechury, referring to the January 5 violence on the campus.

Former JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar said, “The Home Minister keeps referring to the ‘tukde tukde (divisive) gang’. I want to tell him that I own the term proudly. We will shatter into pieces their dream of dividing the country.”

‘Restrictions imposed’

Sana Khan, a PhD scholar who was among the protesters, said the character of JNU had changed since Mr. Kumar had taken charge. “When I joined ten years back for my MA course, JNU was a space where one could have debates and students from various classes mingled. It was a place which helped us break stereotypes. Suddenly, the entire character of the university has changed with the V-C bringing in all kinds of restrictions,” she said.

Sohini Dasgupta, another JNU student, was seen carrying a blank poster. “We have so much to say that it cannot fit in one poster. While the fee hike should be revoked completely, the V-C should immediately step down. This is an issue affecting thousands of students. If we students don’t speak up now, who will?” she said.

He was addressing the Punjab Youth Congress (PYC) members and workers at the installation ceremony of the youth wing’s newly elected office-bearers, including its president Barinder Singh Dhillon here.

Capt. Amarinder said the Congress was the only party that could provide secular, democratic rule. “It fought for Independence and the Constitution was framed on the Preamble of a socialist secular democratic republic,” he pointed out, adding that though the various Articles had since undergone many amendments, the Preamble had remained untouched.

“The Preamble cannot be allowed to be tinkered with,” said Capt. Amarinder, hitting out at the attempts by the BJP to divide the nation. “What prevails today is not Lok Raj but goonda raj. We all know what happened with Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Uttar Pradesh,” he said, underlining the need for the youth to take the lead in saving the country.

Capt. Amarinder said he would continue to lead the State in its growth and development and would not quit politics till he had ensured jobs for the youth and opportunities for all to grow in a progressive Punjab.

“This is my State, you are all my people…I will always be here for you and will not go anywhere till I have ensured the welfare of every citizen of Punjab.”

74,2020/01/09,"JNU violence officially sponsored goondaism, says Congress","The Congress on Thursday demanded the resignation of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice-Chancellor (VC) M. Jagadesh Kumar and alleged that the perpetrators of Sunday’s violence had not been arrested as they were ‘sanctioned’ by Home Minister Amit Shah and Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhariyal Nishank.

At a press conference at the party headquarters, former Union Minister and senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh described the violence as “officially sponsored goondaism”.

“It didn’t not happen suddenly but was done at the behest of some people. We know who these people are. I am making a direct allegation that the HRD Minister and the Home Minister were involved. This was State-sponsored goondaism,” Mr. Ramesh alleged.

“It has been 72 hours since the attack and the Delhi police have information who indulged in violence and vandalism. There has been a very casual and irresponsible approach. We demand that those responsible for the violence be arrested immediately,” he added.

The Congress leader said “it is clear now that as long as Mr. Jagadesk Kumar continues as the V-C, normalcy won’t return to the campus”.

“It is essential for the government to take his resignation for peace to return. A few months back, there was a compromise [over a proposed fee hike that was resisted by the students] that was worked out by the HRD Secretary between the students and the V-C. It is strange that the HRD Secretary was transferred while the V-C continued in his post,” Mr. Ramesh said.

He also said a four-member “fact-finding” team, set up Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, would be submitting its report to the party chief on Friday.

The Congress leader also alleged that the Modi government’s “politics of polarisation” had cost the economy as the nominal GDP has a new low in the past 42 years.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi should admit that his economic policies have been unsuccessful that has resulted in a grave economic crisis. He should consult Dr. Manmohan Singh, who was not only the former Prime Minister but a highly acclaimed economist. Mr Modi should talk to him and find a way forward,” said Mr. Ramesh.

“We know what to do and it is there in our manifesto as well. If the Prime Minister asks us, we will certainly share with him.”

The properties attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act include parcels of land, real-estate projects, commercial projects, residential houses, and a school, cinema hall and cash in bank accounts.

Over 20 cases

The ED’s action is based on over 20 criminal cases registered at various police stations in Haryana’s Faridabad, and the charge-sheets filed by the State Police. A separate FIR was registered by the Economic Offences Wing of the Delhi Police in the same matter.

According to the Agency, accused Anil Jindal, Jitender Kumar Garg and Praveen Kumar Kapoor were the key promoters of the SRS Group. In April 2018, the Faridabad Police had arrested Mr. Jindal and four others on allegations of cheating investors.

The accused, along with his accomplices, lured investments from individuals and institutions in its projects on the promise of high returns. The funds were later siphoned off and diverted to group firms via various shell companies of the SRS Group having dummy directors, who were mainly the Group’s employees.

‘Investors in dark’

“They presented fabricated balance sheets in order to enhance their turnover and balance sheets. They kept investors in the dark by not giving them specific investment plans. In order to sustain their illegal investment schemes, they availed themselves of loans that were used for repayments and to develop their other projects,” alleged the Agency.

The schemes did not have any prudent financial structure, indicating that all was done as part of a conspiracy to cheat investors, as alleged.

81,2020/01/09,"NC, PDP criticise visit of envoys to J&K as an attempt to normalise its clampdown","The National Conference (NC) on Thursday said it was disappointed with the way the government brought envoys from various countries to Jammu and Kashmir to endorse its claims of normalcy in the union territory.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) alleged that the envoys have been brought to the valley on a guided tour, where access has been limited to handpicked individuals who toe the government line.

Envoys from 15 countries, including US Ambassador to India Kenneth I Juster, arrived here on Thursday on a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir, the first visit by diplomats since August last year when the state’s special status was revoked and it was downsized to a union territory.

“The NC wishes to ask these envoys that if the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is normal, then why are scores of people, including three former chief ministers under detention for almost 160 days and why have the people been denied access to the internet for over 5 months?” a statement issued by the party said.

The party described the visit of envoys from 15 countries to Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday as a repeat visit of the MPs from the European Union earlier..

The NC said, “While these visits may provide short-lived propaganda victories, true normalcy will only be achieved when all detainees are released, communications and internet restored and genuine political activity resumed.”

“While the rest of the country is told that peaceful dissent is the cornerstone of democracy, this right does not seem to extend to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Are the people of Jammu and Kashmir expected to live without the fundamental rights accorded to other Indian citizens?” it said.

The PDP wondered if the Prime Ministers Office will allow these visiting envoys to meet detained political leaders, including former chief ministers who are in detention for over 160 days.

The envoys, who are here as a part of the government’s diplomatic outreach to rebut Pakistan’s propaganda on the Kashmir issue, met some political leaders, including former PDP leader Syed Altaf Bukhari, soon after their arrival.

The PDP, commenting on a meeting of breakaway leaders of the party led by Bukhari with Lieutenant Governor G C Murmu earlier this week said, “The government jails those who aided its democracy and strings up puppets who are ready to bargain at the cheapest price.”

“The government should understand that those who really love Kashmiri soil are not for sale,” it said.

Officials said envoys of several countries had requested the government for a visit to Kashmir to get a first-hand account of the situation in the Valley following the decision on August 5 to abrogate provisions of Article 370 and bifurcate it into union territories.

This is the second visit of a foreign delegation to Jammu and Kashmir since August 5. Earlier, Delhi-based think tank International Institute for Non-Aligned Studies took 23 EU MPs on a two-day visit to assess the situation in the union territory.

The government had distanced itself from the visit with Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy informing Parliament that the European parliamentarians were on a private visit.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3t7l3h/article30523729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THPDP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pdp-criticises-visit-of-envoys-from-15-nations-to-jk-as-an-attempt-to-normalise-its-clampdown/article30523730.ece

Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said a similar visit to Kashmir can be organised in future including by EU envoys.

The team of 15 envoys which included the U.S. Ambassador to India Kenneth Juster arrived in Srinagar on Thursday on a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir, the first visit by diplomats since August last year when the state’s special status was revoked and it was downsized to a union territory.

Mr. Kumar said that the visit was facilitated by the government and the envoys met security officials, political leaders, civil society groups and media.

The objective of the visit is to see first hand efforts to normalise the situation in Kashmir, he said.

The visit to J&K was organised considering prevailing situation, he said.

83,2020/01/09,Countrywide stir turning Santiniketan into fertile ground for student politics,"Visva-Bharati, the university founded by Rabindranath Tagore nearly a century ago, does not have a students’ union but agitations across the country appears to have emboldened its student leaders. They are organising themselves to take on the authorities, something that could transform the famous institution into a hotbed of Left-wing student politics.

On Wednesday, they locked up BJP ideologue Swapan Dasgupta, who had come to deliver a lecture on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), for nearly six hours and let him out only late in the night. Such aggression is quite uncharacteristic of Santiniketan. Now they are demanding an apology from Vice Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty for what they call “saffronisation” of the institution.

Mr. Chakrabarty, when he took over as the Vice Chancellor in November 2018, initiated a lecture series under which, every month, an eminent personality is invited to speak on the subject of his or her choice. Students and many teachers accuse him of inviting mainly right-wing speakers, often without the approval of a five-member committee that’s supposed to be consulted on the choice of the speakers. Last month, the speaker was Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy.

Sudipta Bhattacharyya, president of Visva-Bharati Faculty Association, said that even though he is part of the committee, he was never told specifically that it was Mr. Dasgupta who was coming to deliver the lecture. “The committee has met only once so far and is always kept in the dark about the identity of the speakers. What’s the point, then, in having such a committee?” Mr. Bhattacharyya told The Hindu.

The university, however, rejected these accusations. “It was widely publicised that Mr. Dasgupta was coming to deliver the lecture. CAA is a burning subject, students are making noise about it without even understanding what it is all about, which is why we held the lecture. It was an open house, anyone could have walked in and placed their point of view during the question and answer session, but they chose to hold protests and lock us up,” Visva-Bharati PRO Anirban Sircar told this reporter.

When asked if the university would take action against the protesting students, he said, “They are our students, like our children. If children make a mistake, we should make them understand why they are wrong instead of penalising them.”

But student leaders — most of them belonging to Leftist outfits — appear to be preparing for a long haul. According to one of the leaders, Falguni Pan of the Revolutionary Students’ Front, students were meeting on Thursday to decide their road map. They intend to submit a memorandum to the Vice Chancellor with a list of their demands, which include the formation of a students’ union and stopping of “saffronisation” of the institution set up by Tagore.

“If the demands are not met, our protests will continue,” Mr. Pan said. ‘Won’t protests hamper studies?’ “Protests are a way of taking students’ grievances to the authorities. We don’t see them as a hurdle. Moreover, the atmosphere in Santiniketan is such that studies are never hampered,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/countrywide-stir-turning-santiniketan-into-fertile-ground-for-student-politics/article30522683.ece
84,2020/01/09,Congress accuses Centre of double standards,"The Congress on Thursday accused the Union government of adopting double standards on the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) issue by taking ambassadors on “guided political tourism” while barring Indian politicians from the erstwhile State.

“We don’t have a problem with the visit of the envoys, but the government is adopting double standards by allowing the envoys to visit Jammu and Kashmir, but not Indian politicians,” Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said at a press conference.

The party’s attack came on a day when the Ambassadors from 16 countries, including U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Juster, arrived in Srinagar on a two-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir. It is the first visit by diplomats since August last when the erstwhile State was divested of its special status and bifurcated into two Union Territories.

Mr. Ramesh pointed out that former Chief Ministers Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah, of the National Conference, and Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP, were still in detention. Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and another former Chief Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury had to take the Supreme Court’s permission to visit Srinagar, he said.

“We demand that the government allow all politicians unfettered access to Jammu and Kashmir and not resort to guided tours for envoys,” he said. “There have been no meaningful political activity in Jammu and Kashmir since August last. We demand that the Centre immediately start a meaningful political process.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p8dsr7/article30341739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAIRAM-RAMESH-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-adopting-double-standards-by-allowing-envoys-to-visit-jk-but-not-indian-politicians-says-congress/article30522562.ece
85,2020/01/09,Chief Justice Sharad Bobde scoffs at plea to declare CAA ‘constitutional’,"Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde said the country was already going through difficult times and an endeavour should be made to maintain peace.

The CJI made the oral comments while hearing a petition seeking an “aggressive” implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which fast-tracks benefits of citizenship to illegal immigrants who belong to six minority religions in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan but excludes the same treatment to Muslims.

“Country is going through difficult times. Endeavour should be for peace. Such petitions don’t help,” Chief Justice Bobde told the lawyer for Mumbai-based Puneet Kaur Dhanda.

Ms. Dhanda’s petition wanted the court to declare the Act “constitutional”.

But the CJI scoffed at the prayer, explaining to the lawyer that any law passed by the legislature was anyway attached with “a presumption of constitutionality”. It was now for the Supreme Court to independently review the law for elements of unconstitutionality in it.

“How can we just declare it [CAA] constitutional? There is anyway a presumption of constitutionality. You have been a student of law, you would know...” Chief Justice Bobde said.

The court, he said, had listed over 60 petitions challenging the legality of the Act for hearing on January 22. They argued that the Act shredded the nation’s basic and fundamental value of secularism by discriminating in the grant of citizenship on the basis of religion.

The CJI remained non-committal when the lawyer sought for an urgent hearing of his petition favouring the CAA.

Plea for direction to ECI

Ms. Dhanda asked the court to direct the Election Commission of India to take “strict action” against the political parties “spreading false rumours and violence in the country”. The petition also sought legal action against those protesting against the CAA.

The protesters said the Act was a sure step towards the National Register of Citizens. It discriminated in the grant of citizenship on the basis of religion and ripped apart the fabric of secularism.

Ms. Dhanda said an “anti-India stand has become fashion of many students belonging to these institutions [Jamia Millia Islamia and Jawaharlal Nehru University] which, otherwise, were famous for the achievements of their legendary students”.

She sought strict action by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting against newspapers and media houses that were “spreading false information and rumours”. She asked the Supreme Court instead to clarify and declare that the CAA was “not against the spirit of Constitution of India and in no sense against any citizen of India”.

The petition said, “Political parties against the Central government have spread false rumours across the country regarding the Muslim brothers and sisters of our country that they will be thrown out from the country hereby creating an environment of fear and restlessness as a result of which violence has spread across the country... This has caused a huge economic loss and also brought a bad name to our country.”

The plea may be listed on January 22 along with the 60 anti-CAA petitions filed by parliamentarians, civil rights groups, NGOs, political parties, activists and citizens from all walks of life across the country.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lvg2qb/article30496646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chief-justice-sharad-bobde-scoffs-at-plea-to-declare-caa-constitutional/article30521922.ece

The signatories are from universities in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Germany, Norway, France, Italy, Denmark, Australia, South Africa, Ireland, Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Taiwan, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden, Spain, Brazil, Portugal and New Zealand.

The signatories said that the incident, “which took place on January 6 when an armed and politically motivated mob was allowed to enter the JNU campus” violated every norm of democracy.

It violated the norms of academic freedom, of the protection of universities from arbitrary state power and of the duty of university administrators to protect their students and faculty, they said.

90,2020/01/09,Nirbhaya case: Two death row convicts file curative plea in Supreme Court,"Curative petitions were filed in the Supreme Court by two convicts in the Nirbhaya case on Thursday. The petitions come just days after a Delhi sessions court scheduled the execution of the four convicts at Tihar Jail on January 22.

Also read: Nirbhaya case convict breaks down after hearing execution date

Vinay Sharma and Mukesh, in separate curative petitions, said there had been a sea change in the death penalty jurisprudence. They argued that ignoring the subsequent changes in the law against the death penalty would be a “gross miscarriage of justice”.

A curative petition is a rare remedy devised by a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in its judgment in the Rupa Ashok Hurra case in 2002. A party can take only two limited grounds in a curative petition — one, that he was not heard by the court before the adverse judgment was passed, and two, the judge was biased. A curative petition, which follows the dismissal of a review petition, is the last legal avenue open for convicts in the Supreme Court.

Sharma was the first of the four convicts to file a curative petition, arguing that there had been “a change in the law on death sentence in India” since the death penalty was first confirmed for the Nirbhaya convicts in 2017.

“After the pronouncement of judgment in 2017, there have been as many as 17 cases involving rape and murder in which various three-judge Benches of the Supreme Court have commuted the sentence of death,” the petition contended.

It argued that this “corpus of case law” had caused a “definite change” in the sentencing jurisprudence. Hence, this would require Sharma’s case to be reheard.

The court had recently dismissed a review petition filed by another of the four condemned men, Akshay Singh, to review its May 5, 2017 judgment confirming the death penalty.

The court had also refused his plea to grant him three weeks time to file a mercy petition before the President of India.

A Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi had said it was open for the Nirbhaya convicts to avail whatever time the law prescribes for the purpose of filing mercy pleas.

Akshay (33), Mukesh (30), Pawan Gupta (23) and Sharma (24) brutally gang-raped a 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012. She died of her injuries a few days later.

The case shocked the nation and led to the tightening of anti-rape laws. Rape, especially gang rape, is now a capital crime.

Also Read Congress accuses Centre of double standards

They are seeking a feedback on the ground situation post the revocation of the State’s special status, Pakistan’s attempts at interference and immediate demands of the people.

Unlike the controversial tour of the European Union (EU) parliamentarians in October last year, these envoys, also comprising U.S. ambassador to India Kenneth I. Juster and the Norwegian ambassador, drove past busy streets from the airport to reach the venue at Lalit Grand Palace Hotel. The venue is very close to the sub-jail where National Conference vice-president Omar Abdullah has been detained since August 5. The envoys did not meet the detained leader.

No shutdown was observed by locals nor was violence reported, unlike the time when EU parliamentarians visited.

Closed-door meetings

During their meetings with the politicians, local editors and elected grassroots leaders like panchs and councillors, the envoys posed pointed questions on the revocation of Article 370 and wanted to know if Pakistan was making attempts to interfere, local delegates who met them told The Hindu. There was a common demand for restoration of Internet service, they added.

The foreign envoys, mainly invited from South America, Africa and Asia, held a closed-door interaction with a group of prominent politicians led by Altaf Bukhari, who is fast emerging as the face of the non-National Conference (NC) and non-Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) third front.

“We apprised the delegation of the current situation. We told them that people were hurt by the abrogation of Article 370; the matter is before the apex court now,” said Mr. Bukhari. He stressed the need to restore Statehood, introduce domicile laws to safeguard land, and find jobs for the locals.

The politicians also called for “immediate release of all political leaders and the youth in the Valley.”

Prominent political faces that met the foreign envoys included Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Party Nationalist’s Ghulam Hassan Mir, PDP’s Noor Muhammad Sheikh, Rafi Mir, Javaid Baigh, Abdul Raheem Rather and Majeed Padder and Congress’s Hilal Shah and Shoaib Lone.

PDP action

Shortly after the meeting, a tweet from the PDP’s official handle said, “Certain party leaders are part of parleys which go against the interests of J&K, the official position and core beliefs. The disciplinary committee has recommended expulsion of these leaders.”

However, Rafi Mir told The Hindu that he did not go against people’s aspirations or the party’s stand. “I have my own mind and no one can control me,” he said. Mr. Mir shared his “way forward to restore peace and normalcy in J&K” with the envoys.

No prominent civil society group or trade body met the envoys. An NC spokesman termed the visit “a guided tour.”

The Army hosted the envoys at its headquarters in Badamibagh and apprised them of the current security scenario, including the issue of terrorism, and Pakistan’s attempts to “destabilise the situation on the Line of Control (LoC) and the mainland in the Union Territory.”

The NPF is no longer a friend of the BJP in Nagaland but is part of the BJP-headed coalition government in adjoining Manipur.

On December 20, 2019, the NPF’s disciplinary action committee served show-cause notices to Lorho Pfoze, the Lok Sabha member elected from the Outer Manipur constituency, and Mr. Kenye, who represents Nagaland in the Upper House.

The committee had asked the two parliamentarians why they had defied a party resolution on January 31, 2019, to oppose the Citizenship Bill that proposed to fast-track the citizenship process for non-Muslims who allegedly fled religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan till December 31, 2014.

Mr. Kenye quit the post of NPF secretary general the following day, but did not resign from the party.

On Wednesday, the NPF’s Disciplinary Action Committee treated Mr. Kenye’s support to the Bill as an anti-party activity and decided to suspend him.

Mr. Kenye had earlier clarified that he had voted for the Bill as it granted exemption to Nagaland under provisions of the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulation, 1873, that requires visitors to enter the State with an inner-line permit for a temporary period.

Ahead of the action against Mr. Kenye, NPF president Shurhozelie Liezietsu had said it would be of no use to argue over the merits and demerits of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at this juncture. The people, he added, must understand the true colour of the CAA with long-term perspective.

“The effect of the CAA will come very slowly in the form of population politics.

The claim is false; the purported newspaper story was created using a newspaper clipping generator website; media reports stated Mr. Gandhi was temporarily detained at Boston Airport in the U.S. in 2001 but they did not state that he was arrested.The image was published in this Facebook post on December 26, 2019.

The image shows a section of a “Boston” newspaper report, dated September 30, 2001, with the headline “Indian Politician Arrested”.

The text reads: “An Indian politician was detained at Boston airport when the airport security found him in possession of banned drugs and unaccounted cash. As per our sources, he is the son of a former Indian Prime Minister. He was later released after the intervention of the Indian ambassador to the U.S., reports AFP.”

The caption reads: “When Rahul Gandhi was arrested back in Boston for drugs. He was released after intervention by PM Vajpeyee. Soniya begged and large-hearted Vajpeyee spoke to U.S. authorities. Now such shabby character wants to be PM. One can check newspaper clipping of Boston(USA).”

Rahul Gandhi is the former president of India’s main opposition Indian National Congress party.

“PM Vajpayee” refers to former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and “Soniya” is the former president of the Congress Party, and Rahul Gandhi’s mother, Sonia Gandhi.

97,2020/01/09,Union Health Ministry tells youth to ‘stay away and safe’ from e-cigarettes,"Alarmed by the annual jump in e-cigarette use among high school children (77.8% rise) and middle school children (48.5% rise) according to the U.S.’s 2018 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS) data, India’s Union Health Ministry has asked youth here to “stay away and safe”.

The Ministry says data from American teens shows that, among middle and high school students, tobacco abuse increased alarmingly between 2017 and 2018, with over 3.6 million kids using e-cigarettes in 2018.

‘Most effective ban’

While Parliament has passed the Prohibition of Electronic Cigarettes (Production, Manufacture, Import, Export, Transport, Sale, Distribution, Storage and Advertisement) Bill, 2019, a senior Health Ministry official noted that creating awareness and education among the youth against the use of e-cigarettes is the “most effective ban”.

“What government and experts are worried about is the highly additive nature of nicotine. There is also the risk of use of other psychoactive substances through these devices, and initiation of nicotine or psychoactive substances by non-smokers, especially adolescents and youth. Besides, there is scant scientific evidence for the use of e-cigarettes as effective tobacco cessation aids,” a Health Ministry official said.

In comparison

However, those arguing in favour of e-cigarettes note that since e-cigarettes use vapour technology, they expose users to fewer carcinogens that traditional cigarettes. They also note that in multiple studies and surveys, e-cigarettes have been shown to potentially help smokers reduce their habit or to quit altogether.

98,2020/01/09,Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Dinesh Gunawardena to meet External Affairs Minister Jaishankar on January 9,"Sri Lanka’s Minister of Foreign Relations Dinesh Gunawardena will hold bilateral discussions in New Delhi on Thursday, including with his Indian counterpart Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar. He was scheduled to arrive in Delhi late on Wednesday.

Mr. Gunawardena’s visit comes over a month after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was in New Delhi, on his maiden visit abroad after being elected to the country’s highest office in the November presidential election.

According to the Ministry of External Affairs, the visiting Foreign Minister will meet Mr. Jaishankar in the morning, after a meeting with the Foreign Secretary.

Minister Gunawardena’s visit marks a high-level follow-up to President Rajapaksa’s New Delhi visit. India announced a $450 million line of credit for development and counter-terror.

In an interview to The Hindu then, President Rajapaksa promised he would be “frank” and “upfront” to avoid the misunderstandings of the past between New Delhi and Colombo. India and other countries must invest more in Sri Lanka to counter Chinese investment, he had said. Further, Mr. Gotabaya underscored development, not power devolution, to the war-affected Tamil community, raising concern among the Sri Lankan Tamil polity over prospects for post-war reconciliation and the long-pending political solution. This, after New Delhi conveyed to Colombo its “expectation” that the new government take forward post-war reconciliation.

Mr. Gunawardena’s visit will likely point to Colombo’s next steps in its engagement with New Delhi, including in development cooperation. New Delhi and Colombo have been negotiating possible partnerships in developing the world-war era oil tanks in the eastern Trincomalee district and the East Container Terminal in Colombo — a project Japan is also part of — with little progress. While India had held discussions on the southern Mattala airport adjoining the Chinese-built and run Hambantota port with the predecessor government, President Rajapaksa has said Sri Lanka will develop the airport on its own.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/1szyha/article30518457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-DINESHGUNAWARDENA-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gunawardena-to-meet-jaishankar/article30517888.ece
99,2020/01/09,Navy rescues dhow with Indian crew in Gulf of Aden,"In the backdrop of heightened tensions in the Gulf region, the Navy said on Wednesday that it was committed to protecting the “country’s maritime interests” and is closely monitoring the situation. Two days ago an Indian Navy ship deployed on anti-piracy patrol in the Gulf of Aden rescued a Sri Lankan-flagged dhow with 13 Indian crew members that was stranded after engine failure and adrift towards the Somalian coast.

“Indian Navy continues to monitor the situation in the Gulf region and is maintaining presence in the region to ensure security of our sea-borne trade and the safety of Indian flag merchant vessels transiting through the region,” the Navy said in a statement.

Anti-piracy patrol

INS Sumedha which is on anti-piracy patrol in the Gulf of Aden came to the rescue of the crew of the dhow Al-Hamid on January 6, Navy spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said on the sidelines of an event to showcase the Navy’s tableau for the coming Republic Day parade.

A traditional wooden vessel known as “Dhow,” Al-Hamid was detected by a Navy helicopter launched from the deck of INS Sumedha, which confirmed that the vessel was in distress and drifting near the coast of Somalia,” a Navy statement said. A boarding team along with a naval technical team embarked Al-Hamid for routine checks onboard and render assistance and an assessment revealed that the dhow had suffered a broken main engine shaft, which was not repairable at sea.

The dhow was then towed to safety away from the Somali coast, the Navy stated. Later, the owner of the Al-Hamid has sent another vessel for towing the dhow to port for repairs, the Navy said, adding, before departure, INS Sumedha provided fresh water and medical supplies to the crew of the dhow.

Disaster relief

This year’s tableau of the Navy showcases the under construction indigenous aircraft carrier Vikrant, indigenously built Kolkata class stealth destroyer and French Scorpene class submarine Kalvari.

The murals on the sides of the tableau showcase the Navy’s efforts in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) in the form of rescue operations undertaken on Mahalaxmi Express in Maharashtra last July and the escort operations undertaken in the Persian Gulf under Operation Sankalp.

The Navy had launched ‘Operation Sankalp’ to escort Indian-flagged merchant vessels transiting through to Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman after attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman in May and June last year. Later, three-member Navy teams embarked Indian large energy carrying platforms, on request, to advise on protection measures.

Presently, there is one ship being maintained in the Gulf of Aden and one in Gulf of Oman. So far over 70 vessels equivalent to 85 lakh tonnes of cargo were escorted by the Navy under Operation Sankalp, of which about 50 vessels were embarked by armed Navy teams, Navy sources said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/9qbk4d/article30518093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-DHOW-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/navy-rescues-dhow-with-indian-crew-in-gulf-of-aden/article30517848.ece

The actor attended an event which aimed to counter “Free Kashmir (narrative), anti-India slogans, false propaganda and clear the misconception.”

Juhi said as artistes, it’s unfair to be questioned about incidents “just for a reaction” when they should be given time to truly understand the situation.

“We are going to work, thinking how to execute our task, then some incident happens somewhere and suddenly the media asks, ‘what do you think about this?’ We haven’t understood the matter, people haven’t understood the matter but you need a reaction.

“Let people understand, whether it’s NRC or CAA, and what’s is it about, why is this being talked about,” Ms. Juhi told reporters.

The actor said it is sad that people talk about division more than unity.

“Everyone is quick to talk about dividing. Why don’t we talk about uniting? Why does everyone say ‘what is the government doing, why is it doing this?’ but I say if you point one finger there then three fingers are at you.

This was the fifth time the Council of Ministers met since December 21, where specific sector-related issues were deliberated at length.

At every such meeting, top government officials usually make presentations.

The meetings are part of an exercise to finalise an action plan for key ministries for the next five years.

All the welfare schemes from across the ministries were discussed threadbare and their progress was evaluated at Wednesday’s meeting, the sources said.

There was a special focus on the implementation of the schemes and how those could be made more effective for the beneficiaries at the grass-roots level, they added.

Based on the suggestions received at these meetings on the presentations by several committees of secretaries, the government would finalise the action plan for various ministries for the next five years.

The ministries are divided into various sectors such as agriculture, health, governance and technology for a speedier and better implementation of policies.

The action plan would help implement the policies for governance and development in a more systematic way and take the benefits to the grassroots level.

Another meeting of the Council of Ministers could take place next week to complete the review exercise, the sources said.

A panel of doctors at the Ahmedabad civil hospital on Wednesday conducted the postmortem.

The autopsy was conducted after the police lodged a case of kidnapping, gangrape and murder against four persons. The four had allegedly kidnapped the victim, gangraped her before murdering. They did not stop at that, after murdering, they hanged the body on a tree to make it a suicide case.

Gone missing

The victim had gone missing on December 31 and her body was found on Sunday.

According to the details of the Nirbhaya-like case, after the deceased went missing, her family had approached the police on January 3 to lodge an FIR but the local police refused. Local police inspector N.L. Rabari told the family that the girl was safe and had eloped with a boy of the same community and both had got married so no case was required to be lodged.

However, on January 5, her body was found hanging on a tree. The family members refused to accept the body contending that she was murdered and did not commit suicide.

FIR against four

On Tuesday, the police lodged an FIR naming four persons — Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvad, Satish Bharvad and Jigar — for the incident.

After the registration of the FIR, the family agreed to claim the body, which was sent for postmortem at the Ahmedabad civil hospital.

The case was registered under various provisions and Sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act after protest by thousands of Dalits in front of the local police station.

103,2020/01/09,"Capital fight will continue, come what may: TDP chief","Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday asserted that the agitation against the government’s plans to shift part of the Capital to Visakhapatnam would intensify if the government tried to suppress it labelling it a law and order problem.

Addressing a meeting organised by Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi here, Mr. Naidu said it was unfortunate that the police foiled the bus yatra of the Joint Action Committee (JAC)citing security problems. It was not correct on the part of the government to stop the yatra. “Father (YS Rajasekahra Reddy and son (Jagan Mohan Reddy) had undertaken padayatras when I served as Chief Minister. Would it have been possible for them to take out padayatras had I taken a similar stand? he asked.

“The agitation for the people’s capital will continue come what may. As many as 11 farmers died of heart attack while protesting against the government’s proposals. The government says ₹1 lakh crore is required for construction of the Capital city. The Secretariat, the Assembly and the High Court are already in place. What more they want? They allege that insider trading happened. If it were really true, let them order a probe by a sitting judge,” he said.

‘Prove charges if they are true’

CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna said that Amaravati should be continued as the Capital. Also, the backward regions should be developed. The Ministers read out the names in the Assembly alleging insider trading. If their claims were true, why no action had been taken till date, he asked.

TDP leader and former Deputy Chief Minister K. E. Krishnamurthy sought to know why the Chief Minister was afraid of the bus yatra. The student, employees and people organisations should wage a united struggle against the government’s “undemocratic policies” and “autocratic rule,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/b1ia7p/article30527364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VJNAIDUAPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/capital-fight-will-continue-come-what-may-tdp-chief/article30527365.ece

Mr. Naidu, accompanied by leaders of various political parties, launched a State-level movement under the banner of the Amaravati Parirakshna Samithi against the move to shift the capital from Amaravati.

Mr. Naidu walked along the streets seeking donations from the people for stepping up the movement, and mobilised ₹3.1 lakh.

Later, addressing a gathering at the Koneru Centre, Mr. Naidu ridiculed the idea of setting up three capitals at Visakhapatnam, Kurnool, and Amaravati.

“Deserting Amaravati is akin to killing the goose that lays golden eggs. Amaravati has the capability of creating wealth with the available land. The government need not spend anything on it, for it has has been designed so,” Mr. Naidu said.

‘Dream shattered’

On Visakhapatnam, Mr. Naidu said, “The port city has the potential to become the financial and technological hub of the State. My dream of exploring its potential has been shattered as it is being chosen as the administrative headquarters.”

The former Chief Minister appealed to the people to participate in the movement against shifting the capital.

Addressing media persons on Thursday, Mr. Manohar said the government was trying to suppress agitations and Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has no time to listen to the public grievances, which makes him unfit to be the Chief Minister.

It was unfortunate that the attempts by Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti to undertake a bus yatra to districts for garnering support for its campaign were thwarted.

‘Reach out to ryots’

Mr. Manohar insisted that the CM should have a dialogue with the aggrieved farmers. The Ministers and officials also need to reach out to people and allay their apprehensions, if one were to believe the claim that there were no ulterior motives behind the three capitals proposal.

The JSP leader said Mr. Jagan took a U-turn on the Amma Vodi scheme by first saying that it was applicable to every child and trying to limit it to a single child in a family.

He expressed regret that people were roaming around several government offices for certificates of proof. Besides, the number of beneficiaries appears to have been slashed from 65 lakh to 43 lakh.

The JSP leader alleged that the funds of the SC & ST Corporation, the BC Welfare Corporation and the Kapu Corporation were being diverted to the Amma Vodi scheme.

118,2020/01/09,‘APERC has interests of all sections in mind’,"A.P. Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) Chairman and retired judge Justice C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy said he was supposed to do a balancing act of keeping the tariffs at levels that are affordable to all categories of consumers and ensuring the power utilities do not incur major losses on account of various subsidies and the impact of rising costs. He claimed to be doing that to the extent possible and sounded confident of accomplishing the task.

Justice Nagarjuna Reddy said though compensating farmers for the loss of value of their land due to the laying of High Tension (HT) lines did not come under its purview, the APERC would try to redress that grievance.

For this, the issues arising from the Electricity Act, 2003, and the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, were to be sorted out by the Central and State governments, he said.

Speaking at the APERC’s public hearing on the Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) of Discoms and proposed retail tariffs for 2020-21 here on Thursday, Justice Nagarjuna Reddy said he was for reasonable tariffs and asserted that the Commission would do justice to the consumers within its limits as it was up to the government to frame rules while some matters were pending in courts.

First point of contact

The first point of contact for the aggrieved farmers were district Collectors and the complaints could be escalated to the next level if no solutions were found.

AP-Transco Joint Managing Director K.V.N. Chakradhar Babu said the A.P. power utilities owed ₹16,000 crore to the power producers and their losses amounted to ₹29,000 crore. The total operating expenses stood around ₹8,000 crore.

The government had given ₹11,000 crore to the Discoms in the last six months.

CPI(M) State secretariat member Ch. Babu Rao said the APERC should take stock of the renewable Power Purchase Agreements which entailed a huge burden on the exchequer.

Federation of Farmers’ Associations leader Cherukuri Venugopal said farmers were in dire straits due to the loss caused by HT lines passing through their fields and the grey areas thereof were to be removed to render justice to them.

APERC members P. Rama Mohan and P. Raghu, Discoms’ CMDs H. Haranatha Rao (SPDCL) and J. Padma Janardhan Reddy (CPDCL), NREDCAP MD S. Ramana Reddy and CPDCL Directors K. Santosha Rao and Balasubrahmanyam were among those present.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aperc-has-interests-of-all-sections-in-mind/article30525502.ece
119,2020/01/09,SCR seeks to buy power for traction network from cheaper sources,"The South Central Railway (SCR) is likely to start buying power for its traction network in Andhra Pradesh through the open access route due to rising tariffs being charged by the State power utilities.

In fact, SCR’s chief electrical distribution engineer G.V. Mallikarjuna Rao requested A.P. Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) Chairman Justice (retd.) C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy to issue a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) for sourcing power from cheaper sources, at the public hearing on Discoms’ Annual Revenue Requirement (ARR) and proposed tariffs for 2020-21 here on Thursday.

Making a plea to that effect, Mr. Mallikarjuna Rao said the Indian Railways had gone for open access in 12 States, and it would prefer the same in SCR, which included the Vijayawada, Guntakal and Guntur divisions.

The SCR had already paid nearly ₹28 crore for provision of high accuracy Availability-Based Tariffs (ABT) meters at the traction substations that help in monitoring and billing bulk inter-utility power flows.

Having met other pre-conditions, the SCR sought the NOC by treating it as a distribution licensee under Section 14 of the Electricity Act, 2003.

Overall burden

Mr. Mallikarjuna Rao further said that the average unit rate, which was ₹5.14 earlier, was sought to be increased to ₹7.89, and energy charges by ₹2.75 per KVAh. The demand charge stands at ₹350 per KVA. The overall burden on account of the increased tariffs was estimated to be ₹430 crore.

Besides, the Railways is paying huge sums towards cross-subsidy surcharge. It has, therefore, resolved to buy power from independent producers, or energy exchanges, at the tariffs that are affordable for it.

Electrification projects

The SCR has completed 887-km of electrification projects in the last two years, and works are in progress on another 955-km stretch. Besides, 1,564- km of electrification projects have been proposed.

The crux of the issue (purchasing from the State power utilities) is that higher traction tariffs will slash the rate of return for the new railway electrification projects.

The Railways is requesting a special consideration to go for open access with the basic argument that a hike in tariffs will eventually force it to pass on the burden to traders and passengers as a last resort, leading to a spurt in commodity prices and inflation.

It can’t avoid electrification lest the utilisation of diesel should grow tremendously.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/136z8s/article30524992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VJPG4-ELECTRICITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/scr-seeks-to-buy-power-for-traction-network-through-open-access/article30524993.ece
120,2020/01/09,"Make token contribution, CM urges Amma Vodi recipients","Chief minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday urged all beneficiaries of the Amma Vodi scheme to make a contribution of ₹1,000 from their total benefit of ₹15,000 towards maintenance of schools in their respective areas. It would also bring a sense of responsibility among them, he said.

Addressing the gathering after launching the scheme at the PVKN Government Degree College grounds here, Mr. Jagan said: “This will go a long way in the holistic development of the schools. The beneficiaries can question the officials concerned about the functioning of toilets and deployment of watchmen. Amma Vodi is a revolt against outdated syllabus and it will also bring about a phenomenal change in the mid-day meal scheme.”

He said Amma Vodi benefits 42.12 lakh mothers and guardians, covering a total of 81.72 lakh students. All eligible families should submit their applications before February 9 and they could seek the assistance of village volunteers and village secretariat staff.

The CM made it clear that 75% of attendance would be made mandatory to avail the benefit from the next academic year.

Mr. Jagan said that the seed for the launch of Amma Vodi was sown during his walkathon, “as I observed the difficulties of mothers who were unable to send their children to schools and colleges due to financial stringency,” he said.

‘Two more schemes for students’

The CM reiterated the government’s commitment to reach out to poor students through two more schemes – Jagan Anna Vidya Deevena and Jagan Anna Vasathi Deevena. All government schools would be developed in line with the Naadu-Nedu concept.

He said English medium would be introduced from the next academic year in all government schools from classes 1 to 6. Criticising the previous governments for delayed supply of uniforms and textbooks, the CM said as and when the academic year starts, each student would be immediately supplied with a kit, including three pairs of uniform, and textbooks. Mr. Jagan took a dig at his predecessor N. Chandrababu Naidu, a media organisation and “a cinema actor” for throwing mud on the YSRCP government’s commitment to English medium education. For successful grounding of English medium, bridge courses would be introduced for students.

Later, he laid foundation stones for developmental projects in and around Chittoor worth around ₹100 crore.

MLC Dwarapureddi Jagadish accused Mr. Reddy of encouraging real estate business in the north Andhra region.

122,2020/01/09,‘Naidu more concerned about real estate deals in Amaravati’,"Panchayat Raj Minister Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy on Thursday alleged that former Chief Minister and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu had indulged in real estate business in the name of making Amaravati the capital.

Addressing a public meeting at the launch of Amma Vodi scheme here, Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said that Mr. Naidu’s agitation on the capital issue was only to protect the interests of a few hundreds of families and the real estate deals of his family and party leaders.

Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said that while Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was making all efforts to usher in regional development with Kurnool as Judicial capital for the benefit of Rayalaseema and Visakhapatnam as Executive capital for reaching out to the backward region of north Andhra, Mr. Naidu was bent on protecting his real estate business.

“If Mr. Naidu continues to stoke regional passions, he will not be allowed to go anywhere in the State,” Mr. Ramachandra Reddy said.

‘Retrograde policies’

APIIC chairperson and Nagari MLA R.K. Roja lauded Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy for gearing up to usher in development in the State.

Two former Chief Ministers – Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy and Mr. Naidu (both of whom hailed from Chittoor district) had made people suffer due to their retrograde policies, she added.

Repeatedly terming Mr. Naidu as “charitra heenudu” (a person who goes down in history as a betrayer), Ms. Roja said he had not shown interest to develop his own school at his native village.

Mr. Naidu’s policies had led to the closure of over 6,000 government schools to give a boost to the private institutions, she alleged. There was corruption in the distribution of eggs meant for midday meal scheme in schools, she said.

Deputy Chief Minister K. Narayanaswamy said it was Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy who had bestowed political recognition on the SC/ST and minority communities.

Suresh termed the Amma Vodi scheme as a boon to the poor and downtrodden sections, as it would herald a new wave of learning among the students and equip them to compete at the global level, thanks to introduction of English as medium of instruction.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qlgj9g/article30524729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VJPG4-ROJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-more-concerned-about-real-estate-deals-in-amaravati/article30524730.ece
123,2020/01/09,Capital: JAC to intensify agitation,"Members of the Joint Action Committee of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti in Prakasam district on Thursday decided to intensify their agitation against the move to shift the capital from Amaravati. A resolution to this effect was adopted by the JAC at a meeting chaired by its chairman Nalluri Venkateswarlu, popularly known as 'Anna'.

Underscoring the need for a sustained campaign to exert pressure on the YSR Congress Party government, he announced that the members of the JAC, cutting across partyline, would observe relay fast from Friday.

“We will undertake more serious forms of protest, including road blockade at the district, mandal and village levels, if the Jagan Mohan Reddy government remains indifferent to the demand for developing the State capital at Amaravati,” he said. The JAC decided to form JACs in all the 12 constituencies and resort to different forms of protest at the mandal and village levels.

People from different walks of life should come to the streets in support of the Amaravati farmers who had sacrificed their land in the larger interest of the State which had been formed without a capital by the then UPA government at Centre, opined Acharya N.G. Ranga Kisan Samastha president Alla Venkateswara Rao, who led a protest march on the arterial Kurnool road later in the day.

Former Environments Minister Sidda Raghava Rao said it was unfortunate the State government was trying to suppress the democratic protest by using the police.

Former Kanigiri MLA M. Ugra Narasimha Reddy wanted a maximum number of voters to file nominations en masse in the coming local body elections to express their resentment over the government’s three capitals move.

Chandrababu Naidu, and others on Wednesday night.

Right to oppose government decisions

Denouncing the arrests, Visakhapatnam West MLA P.G.V.R Naidu said there was no reason why they should be prevented from staging a peaceful protest. “In a democracy, the Opposition parties have the right to oppose the decisions of the government. Moreover, development of the State has come to a standstill in the last seven months,” he alleged.

“During his tenure as Chief Minister, Chandrababu Naidu had conducted partnerships and many investors had evinced keen interest to invest in the State. Now, they were all shying away due to the prevailing uncertainty in the State,” he added.

‘Nation is laughing at A.P.’

Former MLA Peela Govind Satyanarayana said farmers had given 33,000 acres of land in Amaravati on the call of Mr. Naidu. “Now the nation is laughing at Andhra Pradesh. However, Visakhapatnam should not be deprived of development,” he said.

127,2020/01/09,Govt. to encourage Indian pompano cultivation,"The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI-Visakhapatnam) has registered success in cultivation of Indian pompano in a brackishwater pond here, scientifically proving its commercial viability.

CMFRI-Visakhapatnam in-charge scientist Subhadeep Ghosh claimed that this was the first scientific experiment that was successful in the country in the cultivation of the Indian pompano species in the pond.

The harvesting of the Indian pompano cultivation was attended by Fisheries Minister Mopidevi Venkataramana, Avanigadda MLA Simhadri Ramesh and officials of the National Fisheries Development Board (NFDB).

The NFDB has extended the financial assistance for the experiment which was done by the CMFRI scientists in collaboration with an aqua farmer, Bandi Sunil Kumar.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Subhadeep said: “The survival of the Indian pompano has been recorded 95% during the 11-month duration of the crop period. The growth has been recorded maximum of 750 grams in the open pond and one kg in the cage. These results support for the commercial viability for cultivation of the marine species in the ponds.”

Yield and profit

The yield of the Indian pompano was three tons per acre. The profit is estimated between 25-30 % against the input cost per acre.

On the experiment, Mr. Venkataramana said that the State government would explore the possibilities to encourage cultivation of the Indian pompano in the ponds.

“The experiment by the CMFRI has established that the Indian pompano could be considered as an alternative to shrimp. The State government will create awareness among farmers to switch to the Indian pompano cultivation, apart from ensuring supply of the seed by setting up hatcheries,” said Mr. Venkataramana.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/elken4/article30520206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09ONGMOPIDIVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-to-encourage-indian-pompano-cultivation/article30520207.ece

Trouble broke out when Mr. Naidu and others were prevented from staging a march to Auto Nagar, where the buses were parked to branch out to districts on a bus yatra for garnering support for the agitation against the proposed development of three capital cities.

Earlier, Mr. Naidu inaugurated the APS office at the busy junction in the presence of a huge gathering.

Heated arguments and a scuffle ensued between the police and protesters, and it led to Mr. Naidu and his party cadres and APS activists squatting on the road.

Vehicular traffic came to a standstill and the police made Mr. Naidu and others board a department vehicle, but it could not make a headway due to the blockade for sometime. Tension prevailed as the protesters refused to yield and accused the police of highhandedness.

Following this, the Jayalakshmipuram police initiated investigation and invoked provisions of Section 124A of the IPC against the organisers and named Maridevaiah and others as accused.

Registrar R. Shivappa said the students had not sought permission for holding the protest and hence he has issued a notice to them seeking an explanation. “We have handed over all the photographs and video of the demonstration to the police to help identify the person,” he said.

The general secretary of the association Mahesh Sosle said the organisers and other leaders were marching in the front and were oblivious of a person holding the placard at the rear. “The views expressed by the individual have nothing to with the association or any other student body,” he said.

Taking exception to the sedition case, Mr. Sosle said the students and researchers’ association has participated in many protests and have not used language deleterious to the unity and integrity of India. “But we also do not want lessons in patriotism from the right-wing outfits like BJP, RSS or VHP,” he said, warning of intensifying the protest if they were harassed.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ilmx4y/article30527048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BgQuotescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/free-kashmir-placard-police-book-sedition-case/article30527049.ece
134,2020/01/09,Jyoti Nivas College declares two-day holiday after BJP workers and students clash over CAA,"The management of Jyoti Nivas College in Bengaluru has declared a two-day holiday on Friday and Saturday, following an altercation on Wednesday over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) between a few students and BJP workers.

The students on Thursday staged a peaceful sit-in protest inside the college where they held placards and protested against the incident that took place on Wednesday. The students said that they have the right to debate, dissent and argue and added that others opinion should not be forced on them.

A lecturer at the college said that a cultural fest scheduled on Friday and examination on Saturday too have been postponed. “While the college has officially declared it as study leave, it is because situation is tense and the management wants to avoid a controversy,” a source in the college said.

On Wednesday, BJP workers had put up a banner supporting CAA and reportedly asked passers-by to sign it. Some of the students of the college protested against the signature campaign, which led to an altercation. Following this, additional police personnel were deployed at the college.

“We are inquiring into the incident,” said Isha Pant, DCP (South East). She added that the police will not be taking suo motu action as there is nothing cognizable and the college has not complained.

Meanwhile, the students have been instructed to not speak to the media. MLA Ramalinga Reddy visited the college this morning and assured students of their safety. He said that the BJP workers could take up pro-CAA activities, but not inside or around the college premises.

Meanwhile, Higher Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan has said that all colleges should also take the initiative to spread awareness on CAA. He said that protests were taking place across the country owing to misinformation about the Act.

‘Anti-national’

He said that protesting against such a humanitarian law like the CAA for political mileage amounts to being “anti-national.”

During a press conference, referring to the JNC incident, he said that the students could have complained to the police. “Who gave them the right to question the political party workers?” he said. He defended the BJP party workers and stated that they have not violated the law.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6rzn4c/article30527020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGJYOTHIPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jyoti-nivas-college-declares-two-day-holiday-after-bjp-workers-and-students-clash-over-caa/article30527021.ece
135,2020/01/09,"Bowing to pressure, CM likely to skip Davos trip","Pressure being mounted by ministerial aspirants, especially defectors from the Opposition who helped the Bharatiya Janata Party come to power, appears to have come in the way of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, from January 21 to 24.

“I’m yet to decide on whether to go to Davos. The proposed trip is still doubtful,” he told reporters in Bengaluru on Thursday.

While the Chief Minister desisted from citing reasons, sources close to him admitted that there was pressure from defectors, who have set an eye on ministerial berths, to prioritise Cabinet expansion. The 11 defectors, who won the byelections to the Assembly on BJP ticket, do no want it to be delayed further. They are reportedly worried that his foreign trip would further put off the exercise.

They have been waiting for ministerial berths for about a month. They are keen that the Chief Minister take it up soon after Sankranthi on January 15.

Mr. Yediyurappa told mediapersons that he would be visiting New Delhi a couple of days before Sankranthi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss issues related to development of the State.

“I will also discuss ministerial expansion with the central leaders,” he said.

A senior ministerial colleague of Mr. Yediyurappa said that the Chief Minister had sought the appointment of the central leaders and he would travel to New Delhi depending upon their convenience.

Sources close to Mr. Yediyurappa said that he wanted to effect ministerial expansion by January 20. He was not very keen on embarking on a trip to Davos, added sources.

They are also confident that Mr. Yediyurappa’s words will carry weight with the party high command this time, in the wake of the party’s victory in bypolls under his leadership.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9nf9z1/article30527008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGBSY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bowing-to-pressure-cm-likely-to-skip-davos-trip/article30527009.ece
136,2020/01/09,Tomorrow’s CWC meet may discuss names of new KPCC president,"The State Congress leaders are expecting the long-awaited announcement of a candidate for the post of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president after the Congress Working Committee’s (CWC) meeting on Saturday.

Sources in the party said central leaders are expected to discuss the names of suitable candidates at the meeting. The party would most probably announce the name of the new president in one or two days after the CWC meeting.

The KPCC president’s post has been vacant for the past one month. Former Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao resigned to the post on December 9, after the party’s poor show in byelections to 15 Legislative Assembly constituencies.

AICC interim president Sonia Gandhi would chair the meeting at the party headquarters in Delhi, which is expected to take many important decisions, including the party’s opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act and the ongoing unrest in the country and alleged high-handedness of the government.

In the CWC, the State would be represented by M. Mallikarjun Kharge and AICC general secretary in charge of Karnataka K.C. Venugopal. K.H. Muniyappa, who is aspiring to become the KPCC president, is the special invitee to the CWC.

Several senior leaders such as D.K. Shivakumar, Eshwar Khandre, and K.H. Muniyappa have been vying for the KPCC president’s post. They held a series of meetings with their loyalists and weighed their chances of becoming the State Congress chief.

However, to arrive at a consensus among the leaders about the next party chief, Ms. Gandhi had directed former KPCC chief G. Parameshwara to convene a meeting of prominent State leaders. Mr. Parameshwara, who convened the meeting at his residence last Saturday, has reportedly submitted a report to the AICC suggesting suitable names.

Meanwhile, Mr. Shivakumar who spoke to media on Thursday, declined to comment on the issue of KPCC chief post. He clarified that he had not received any notice from the Enforcement Directorate on his alleged role in money laundering.

Mr. Khandre too spoke to the media and said he would be ready to handle any responsibility assigned to him by the party. He clarified that the Lingayat community has not distanced itself from the Congress.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tomorrows-cwc-meet-may-discuss-names-of-new-kpcc-president/article30526994.ece

Yediyurappa to increase the quota for STs in jobs and educational institutions from the present 3% to 7.5%.

The government has already constituted a panel headed by H.N. Nagmohan Das to look into the issue of increasing reservation for STs. There has been mounting political pressure to increase quota.

Mr. Sai, who spoke to the media after a meeting with officials of the Social Welfare Department, said the commission found vacancies of 50% posts reserved for STs in various departments. The commission also felt that several posts of teachers have remained vacant in schools located in tribal areas.

The commission chairman said STs constituted more than 7% of the State’s total population. Hence, there was a need to increase the quota for community members from existing 3% to 7.5% in educational institutions and jobs in the government sector. Members of the Valmiki community have also been demanding the same for the past one decade.

140,2020/01/09,Sringeri sahitya sammelan faces new set of hurdles,"The two-day 16th Chikkamagaluru district Kannada Sahitya Sammelan at Sringeri from Friday, that is facing pressure from Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi to change the event president, had a new set of hurdles to cross on Thursday.

While the police had denied permission for a procession citing possible law and order issues, the Town Panchayat denied permission to put up banners, flex and buntings of the event. The Deputy Director of Public Instruction also withdrew the on official duty (OOD) facility for teachers, who wanted to attend the event. Similarly, the Deputy Director of Pre-University Education withdrew the OOD facility granted earlier for PU lecturers.

However, the organisers, the Chikkamagaluru district unit of Kannada Sahitya Parishat (KSP), has decided to go ahead with the event.

Mr. Ravi, who is also Minister in-charge of the district, had opposed the selection of Kalkuli Vittala Heggade to preside over the event and had instructed the Central KSP not to release its grant for the event. He described Mr. Heggade as a “naxal sympathiser”.

Kundur Ashok, district president of KSP, told The Hindu: “The preparations for the event are under way. We will hold the event, despite all difficulties. The Town Panchayat, where the BJP holds power, has denied permission to put up banners and buntings,” he said.

Banners removed

The event is scheduled to be held at BGS Samudaya Bhavan in Sringeri town. The police visited the spot on Thursday and ensured banners put up by the organisers were removed. Naveen Karuvane, an office-bearer of the sahitya parishat, said: “The administration is obstructing the arrangements at every step. We are committed to holding the event.”

Many intellectuals and writers have expressed their support to the event. Noted theatre personality Prasanna issued a statement criticising the State government for its stand on this issue. “It is an assault on the culture of the land,” he said.

Meanwhile, organisations opposing the selection of Mr. Heggade circulated pamphlets for Sringeri bandh on Friday as a mark of protest against the sammelan.

141,2020/01/09,"Defending ACB, govt. tells HC that Lokayukta’s power not diluted","The State government on Thursday defended setting up of the Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) to probe corruption cases under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act, 1988, by withdrawing the power which was earlier vested with the Lokayukta police.

“Neither anything was taken away from the Lokayukta nor has the government diluted the Karnataka Lokayukta Act by setting up of ACB with effect from March 14, 2016,” it was contended before a Division Bench comprising Justice Aravind Kumar and Justice Suraj Govindraj during the hearing of petitions challenging the legality of the creation of ACB.

State-Advocate General Prabhuling K. Navadgi also contended that the Lokayukta had nothing to do with the PC Act and establishment of ACB does not amount to diluting the power of the Lokayukta, while arguing that the government has the executive power under Article 162 of the Constitution to issue an order for creating a separate police wing.

The A-G termed as “baseless” the allegation made in the petitions that the Lokayukta has been rendered toothless owing to withdrawal of power under PC Act from the Lokayukta police, while contending that Lokayukta has all the powers that are vested under the Karnataka Lokayukta Act.

The ACB is a separate wing in the police to exclusively investigate cases under the PC Act on the lines of special wings like cybercrime, economic and narcotics control bureau, the A-G said, contending that the State government has the power to declare a police station under Section 17 of the PC Act.

To a query from the Bench that under whose control the ACB functions, the A-G said that the ACB workers under the Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, which is controlled by the Chief Minister. The A-G also said that one of the main objective of any elected government is to give good governance, which means a corruption-free government, and it would not be correct to say that good government is not possible merely because the political executives control the ACB.

Cases from Lokayukta

The ACB told the court that it had received 421 petitions from the office of the Registrar of the Lokayukta after the power to probe corruption cases was given to the ACB. Of them, 117 petitions are pending inquiry, in 13 cases the report was sent to the Registrar of Lokayukta after inquiry, in 16 cases the FIRs have been filed, and 251 petitions have been closed after inquiry.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/t1h3a9/article30526783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BgACBcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/defending-acb-govt-tells-hc-that-lokayuktas-power-not-diluted/article30526784.ece

Suresh, member (judicial), and C.V. Sankar, member (administrative), of Central Administrative Tribunal’s Bengaluru Bench, after they tendered “unconditional apology”.

A Division Bench dropped the proceedings initiated on a complaint by the Centre, represented by Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, and Prabhakar Singh, Director-General, Central Public Works Department (CPWD). While seeking “unconditional apology for lapses, if any, that has occurred in the matter”, the members requested the High Court to discharge them in the contempt proceedings, while also requesting that “in the larger interest, they may be purged in the contempt proceedings against them.”

“Tendering of an unconditional apology, according to us, is an act of remorse and we accept it,” the Bench observed in its order. It was alleged in the complaint that the members of the tribunal had wilfully violated the High Court’s July 12, 2019, order for deciding “jurisdiction of the tribunal” to hear a petition filed by the CPWD Engineer’s Association, Bengaluru Zone, which had questioned the office memorandum of CPWD’s revised organisational structure of March 2019, which came into force on April 1, 2019.

The petitioner claimed that the Karnataka High Court should enforce the order of the apex court for all courts in the State.

However, the Chief Justice told the petitioner that the apex court had not issued any specific direction to the High Courts for audio-video recording of court proceedings but left it to the discretion of the Chief Justices of the High Courts.

144,2020/01/09,‘Recover 200 acres of land grabbed by Kumaraswamy and Thammanna’,"Samaj Parivarthan Samudaya (SPS) has urged the State government to seize 200 acres of land said to have been grabbed by the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and his relative and former Minister D.C. Thamanna.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, SPS founder-president S.R. Hiremath said that Mr. Kumaraswamy and Mr. Thamanna together have grabbed nearly 110 acres of gomal land and 90 acres of other land with Survey No 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17 and 79 belonging to the government at Kethiganahalli in Bidadi hobli of Ramnagaram district.

The SPS had filed a complaint with the Lokayukta and after a detailed investigation, the Lokayukta had directed the Revenue Department Principal Secretary to initiate steps for recovery of the government land which is in the possession of Mr. Kumaraswamy and his relatives. The Lokayukta had also ordered initiating criminal action against those involved for trespassing onto government land and also against the officials of the government who were guilty. However, the previous government did not act upon the recommendations of the Lokayukta and did not recover the land, he said.

The SPS has now filed a petition in the High Court Divisional Bench headed by Chief Justice of the High Court of Karnataka A.K. Oka. The SPS has pleaded before court for implementation of the Lokayukta order of August 5, 2014, as more than five years have elapsed and the government has not taken any steps to comply with the order of the Lokayukta.

The High Court has asked government counsel to file submissions regarding compliance with the Lokayukta order and the SPS welcomes this decision. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa should act upon the Lokayukta report and recover the government land and take related action within a time frame under the supervision and control of the High Court, he said.

148,2020/01/09,Metro passengers unhappy with move to slash discount,"The decision of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) to slash the discount offered all these year to smart card holders has not gone down well with metro passengers.

“If it is going to be almost the same rate for both tokens and smart card holders, I might as well buy the token. At least I don't have to go through the hassle of maintaining the minimum balance. In cities like Delhi, the government is talking of free metro rides, but here we are slashing discounts and increasing the fare. Many people bought the smart card after paying an additional cost so they could get this discount. Will the BMRCL return the money that was paid to get the smart card,” asked Neeti N.

Last time, the BMRCL faced criticism for increasing the minimum balance in smart cards to ₹50.

Pallavi, a commuter, said, “Every day, I travel from Peenya to Baiyappanahlli. The cost is around ₹86. In addition, I need to pay for parking at Yelachenahalli and for feeder bus after getting down at Baiyappanahalli. Bengalureans pay a lot for daily travel. The BMRCL should make metro ride affordable.”

Not encouraging use of public transport

“I use metro because it is fast and more reliable. Another reason was that they are giving 15% discount for using smart cards. But now they have reduced the discount to 5%. At a time when every one is talking about incentivising public transport, the BMRCL is burdening passengers. On the one hand, the government urges people to use public transport, and on the other hand, they resort to unpopular measures that discourage people from using public transport,” said Narasimha K.

It is said that reducing discount to 5% will help the BMRCL earn up ₹7 lakh more per day.“Due to the increase in operations of six-coach trains, expenditure on energy has increased. The cost of maintenance and security has also increased considerably. Reducing the discount will not compensate for the entire cash loss, but it may partially help the BMRCL meet the operational cost,” said B.L. Yeshwanth Chavan, Chief PRO. The BMRCL hopes that by the end of January, all the trains on both lines will have six coaches.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/metro-passengers-unhappy-with-move-to-slash-discount/article30520478.ece
149,2020/01/09,Massive protest at Freedom Park,"The nationwide strike called by trade unions on Wednesday saw multiple organisations hold protests at Freedom Park and other parts of the city, but there was no disruption or violence. Workers from various unions attached to Joint Committee of Trade Unions (JCTU) staged a massive protest at Freedom Park to oppose the ‘anti labour policies’ of the Central government, .

Hundreds of farmers, factory and anganwadi workers and domestic help, among others, chanted slogans against the government’s policies. JCTU demanded a national minimum wage of ₹21,000 a month and the abolition of contract labour system. There were also calls for the government to stop the disinvestment of public sector undertakings.

“Due to anti- labour policies of the Central government, workers do not have social security. The Centre has taken the side of big corporates. We have gathered here to protest these decisions,”said Suresh, who works in Peenya industrial area.

Sharada, an anganwadi teacher from Koramangala, expressed anger over the government’s failure to meet their demands. “All we want is a basic pay. They are not ready to pay us but at the same time, extract a lot of work from us. This has been going on for several years,” she said.

Protesters expressed their disappointment with the police for denying permission to take out rallies and processions. “Both the Central and State governments have taken an anti-labour stand,” said a worker.

Kannada Chaluvali Paksha leader Vatal Nagaraj staged a protest near Majestic bus station and tried to stop buses but police dispersed the crowd. He was taken into custody and released later.

Confusion prevailed for some time when a group of people gathered at Town Hall with the intention of taking a procession to Freedom Park. The police prevented them from doing so.

At Devanahalli, which is outside the city limits, some protesters took out a bike rally.

Bengaluru remained unaffected by the strike, though traffic was not as heavy as usual during peak commuting hours in the morning. Bus, taxi, auto and metro services were not interrupted. BMRCL Chief PRO B.L. Yeshwanth Chavan said, “Namma Metro services were operated as per schedule. Considering the strike call, the police had enhanced security at stations.

150,2020/01/09,Digitisation of ancient manuscripts likely to be a collaborative effort,"The proposed project of the Oriental Research Institute (ORI) in the city to digitise ancient palm leaf manuscripts is likely to be a collaborative effort with Bengaluru-based Tara Prakashana. However, these are in the preliminary stages and the proposal will have to receive the nod from the University of Mysore under which the ORI functions.

The ORI has more than 70,000 manuscripts, including 40,000 palm leaf manuscripts, enshrining in them a slice of ancient India’s heritage and knowledge systems.

There are fears that the manuscripts could become brittle and be lost to posterity and hence the varsity’s push to digitise and conserve the ORI collections using new technology.

The project has gathered traction after the UoM agreed to an MoU with the National Mission for Manuscripts which will fund the project.

In the meantime, Pratap Simha, MP, interacted with P.R. Mukund, who is leading the conservation efforts privately, through the Tara Prakashana which has conserved hundreds of rare Vedic manuscripts using imaging technologies.

Mr. Simha and Prof. Mukundan visited the ORI on Wednesday to inspect the collection of palm leaf manuscripts and apprise themselves of the possibility of a collaborative effort, according to ORI officials.

Mr. Simha said he was concerned about the reports of damage to Arthashastra manuscript first discovered and now preserved at the ORI and hence requested Prof. Mukundan and Tara Prakashana to assist in their preservation.

He expressed confidence that the manuscripts could be well-preserved with the available high resolution imaging technology of Tara Prakashana and an MoU in this regard could be signed after going through the due process of discussion with the concerned authorities.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wydogk/article30520354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BGDIDGITISE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/digitisation-of-ancient-manuscripts-likely-to-be-a-collaborative-effort/article30520355.ece

156,2020/01/09,KC(M) Mani faction moves SEC for symbol,"Amidst efforts by the United Democratic Front (UDF) to broker peace, the stage is set for another round of fireworks within the Kerala Congress (M) with the warring factions kick-starting efforts to fight the upcoming local body elections on their own. The KC(M) faction led by Jose K. Mani has now approached the State Election Commission (SEC) seeking to continue with a decision made by the late party chairman K.M. Mani enabling district presidents to allot the symbol and give whip to candidates contesting to local bodies.

Unilateral steps

The petition, submitted by N. Jayaraj, MLA, sought the SEC not to consider the ‘unilateral steps initiated by working chairman P.J. Joseph in violation of this decision’ till the Election Commission of India adjudicated the dispute on the symbol. Along side Mr. Mani, Thomas Chazhikadan, MP, legislators N. Jayaraj and Roshy Augustine too signed the memorandum.

The latest move followed the inability of the candidates fielded by the Mani faction to contest on the party symbol, the ubiquitous `two leaves’.

Earlier in July last year, Mr. Joseph, in his capacity as party's acting chairman, intimated the SEC that he had withdrawn the power delegated to the party district presidents.

“The action of Mr. Joseph will have a bearing on the prospects of the Mani faction as long as it stands by the name KC(M). Hence, its has made this move to pre-empt an embarrassing situation during the election eve,’’ pointed out a senior party leader.

At the Akalakkunnam grama panchayat where a byelection took place recently, the candidates from both factions had sought for the party symbol. George Myladi, a nominee of the Mani faction, had presented the letter of KC(M) district president Sunny Thekkedam for the symbol, where as his rival Vipin Thomas Anikkal had filed his papers along with Mr. Joseph’s letter. The SEC, however, made a final decision in favour of the Joseph faction.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kcm-mani-faction-moves-sec-for-symbol/article30527108.ece

158,2020/01/09,"Caution against drug abuse, alcoholism","Drug abuse and alcoholism as well as the easy availability of liquor will have far-reaching social consequences in the State, V.M. Sudheeran, senior Congress leader, has said. He was inaugurating an awareness programme against drug abuse and alcoholism at the Musaliyar College of Engineering at Malayalappuzha, near here, on Thursday.

The average liquor consumption in Kerala has been put at 37% against the national average of 23.1%. The use of liquor among the youth and women too was found to be on the rise in Kerala he said.

Liquor outlets

Mr. Sudheeran said Kerala was not behind even in the availability of liquor. The number of liquor outlets in the State had gone up considerably from 29 in 2009 to 562 in 2017, besides 365 beer-and-wine parlours, he said.

Though the State used to get a handsome revenue by way of liquor sales, it was nothing compared to the social cost incurred owing to the ever-growing menace of alcoholism, he said. Mr. Sudheeran alleged that drug abuse and alcoholism had left the State at the top among various other States in terms of crime and atrocities against women and children.

159,2020/01/09,Parents oppose KVS move to collect revised fee,"Parents of Kendriya Vidyalaya students in Kerala have criticised the directive of Kendriya Vidyalaya Sanghatan’s Ernakulam regional office to collect revised fee for this academic year with retrospective effect by January 15.

The decision follows the Supreme Court lifting the stay on collection of the increased Vidyalaya Vikas Nidhi (VVN) and computer fee and dismissing a Special Leave Petition filed by the KV Parents’ Association challenging the fee hike.

Though the sanghatan had hiked the fee in 2013 itself, the Kendriya Vidyalaya Parents Association (KVPA) managed to get a stay first from the Kerala High Court and then the Supreme Court in 2014 which continued till 2019. With the lifting of the stay, the KVS authorities recently started seeking the dues for the first, second, and third quarters of this academic year along with the current quarter’s fee. This would force the parents to remit around six times of the normal quarterly fee at once. There are 41 Kendriya Vidyalayas under the Ernakulam region. The VVN for different classes has been hiked from ₹720 and ₹900 to ₹1,500. The computer fee has gone up by ₹150 across the board, according to KVPA representatives.

Reimbursement

N. Prasad, president of the Parent-Teacher Association, Kendriya Vidyalaya, East Hill, Kozhikode, said on Thursday that the KVS misled the apex court by claiming that around 75% of students were entitled to fee reimbursement and the rest were getting the benefits of the Right to Education Act (RTE).

He claimed that over 40% of students in KVs were wards of ex-servicemen who were not entitled to fee reimbursement. Also, though the Supreme Court had clearly said in its order that the KVS authorities could take a call on waiving the dues, they had chosen not to do so. “There is no point in collecting the dues now. The fee collected at a particular time is being used for the requirements arising then itself,” he pointed out.

Meanwhile, the KVPA functionaries have reportedly got an assurance from the Deputy Commissioner, KVS, Ernakulam region, that the dues for the preceding academic years would not be collected now.

160,2020/01/09,Early closure of national park likely,"The authorities are planning to close the Eravikulam National Park (ENP) for tourists early this month following the sighting of a newborn Nilgiri tahr calf in the park.

A park official said on Wednesday that a report was given to higher-ups and there were chances of an early closing of the ENP for tourists in view of the calving season. The park was closed by the end of January last year after a few calves were sighted by the middle of the month.

No sign

The official said there was no sign of a change in the calving season in the wake of a change in climate generally experienced in the region.

Usually the mating season is June-July, in sync with the southwest monsoon, and the calving season is from February to March. However, in view of the early sighting of calves last year, the ENP was closed early and remained shut till April. A detailed study needed to be done whether the change in climate had an impact on the calving season of the Nilgiri tahr. The official said only one calf had been sighted so far.

The Nilgiri tahr population had remained stagnant for long in the ENP with about 700 to 750 individuals. The Forest Department had conducted a survey on the migration of the Nilgiri tahr to the adjoining areas, including the proposed Neelakurinji sanctuary.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/early-closure-of-national-park-likely/article30527077.ece

He was was talking to reporters at Charalkunnu, near Kozhencherry, on Thursday. “The UDF will win the bypoll. But, no coalition partner is supposed to unilaterally announce its candidate. The UDF will announce its candidate in one voice,” he said.

KC(M) feud

Mr. Ramachandran said the Congress had always adopted a conciliatory stance over the dispute between the two Kerala Congress (M) factions. He accused the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] of making conscious attempts to manipulate the local body polls through ward delimitation.

The Congress would approach the Election Commission against this and would launch an agitation, he said.

Inaugurating the Congress leadership camp, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah were nursing the RSS agenda of converting India into a ‘Hindu Rashtra.’ Mr. Modi was hell bent on destroying Parliamentary democracy, he alleged.

He said that both the Houses of Parliament had passed the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill with undue haste.

No discrimination

He said the Congress always accepted all religious denominations and it never displayed any kind of discrimination towards any religious group or sect.

He said the Congress did not need any help from the CPI(M) in its struggle to protect the Constitution. Mr. Ramachandran alleged that the person who ruled the State always maintained a secret understanding with the Hindu extremism.

He said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan should come out in the open criticising the Modi-Shah combine, if he was sincere in the ongoing agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. He further said that Mr. Vijayan was elected to the Assembly for the first time from Koothuparamba with the tacit support of the erstwhile Jana Sangh and that understanding continued even today.

The resolution, presented by T. Muhammadali, former secretary of the KHC, and seconded by general secretary N. Gopakumaran Nair, held that the Act brought in religion as a determinant for citizenship and, as such, violated the provisions of the Constitution of India.

A right

Holding that citizenship was more of a right than something to be proved, it further urged the government to desist from the country-wide implementation of the National Register of Citizens.

The session also condemned the violence, vandalism and atrocities against students, teachers, intellectuals and educational institutions, including the Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi, on account of their articulation of the dissent over the policies of the state.

164,2020/01/09,No let-up in dog-bite cases in Kannur,"Despite the panchayat allocating funds for sterilisation of street dogs under the Animal Birth Control programme (ABC) ), there is no let-up in dog-bite cases in the district. There was a rise in the cases last year, which is the highest in the last five years.

Seven-year-old Niranjan, who was playing in the courtyard of his house in Azhikode, is the recent victim. On Thursday evening, a street dog attacked him biting his nose and lips. The people who came to his rescue on hearing his cry took him to the District Hospital. Since the injuries were serious, he was later shifted to the Kozhikode Medical College Hospital.

Last year, there were 5,794 dog-bite cases, which is an increase of 30% compared to that of 2018. One person died of rabies in December last year.

Data with the Animal Husbandry Department reveal that only 1,339 dogs were sterilised last year. According to Gireesh Babu, Deputy Director, Animal Husbandry Department, there were 47,000 street dogs in the district in 2012 itself. However, under the ABC programme, which started in 2017, just over 5,900 dogs were sterilised. This was because there was only one ABC centre at Pappinesseri, which could manage 200 dogs a year, he said.

Each local panchayat had contributed ₹1lakh to the district panchayat to implement the ABC programme in 2016-17. Though over ₹1crore was collected for the programme, it did not bring about any major change.

Mr. Babu added that easy availability of food refuse such as chicken waste and people leaving dogs on the street after breeding were the two main reasons behind the growing population of stray dogs in the district. “Even though the ABC programme has been implemented, it will take another six to ten years to see a drastic reduction in the number of street dogs,” he said.

He said three ABC centres would be set up at Padiyur panchayat at a cost of ₹63 lakh. Though one centre had been opened at Kodiyeri, it was not functioning now, he said.

He added that this year the district panchayat had allocated ₹82 lakh for the sterilisation programme.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-let-up-in-dog-bite-cases-in-kannur/article30526855.ece
165,2020/01/09,MLA-Collector standoff heading for a showdown,"The standoff between P.V. Anvar, MLA, of Nilambur, and District Collector Jafar Malik over rehabilitation of the flood victims appeared heading for a showdown with the former sending a lawyer’s notice and threatening to file a civil and criminal case against the Collector.

Mr. Anvar on Thursday filed a vigilance complaint against the Collector, accusing him of procuring land for the rehabilitation of the flood-affected people near Munderi at a higher price.

Mr. Anvar also alleged that the Collector had acted unilaterally without discussing either with him or with other Revenue officials.

Collector’s stance

However, the Collector stood firm on his allegations against Mr. Anvar, saying that he was upset because the district administration had not procured the land the MLA wanted to buy. According to Mr. Malik, the MLA had asked the officials to procure the land of his choice for rehabilitating flood victims, but the administration did not budge.

The Collector also alleged that Mr. Anvar had plotted to get cash for the land which had been given free of cost for the rehabilitation of flood victims. Several organisations, meanwhile, rallied behind the Collector in the tug-of-war with the MLA. The Social Democratic Party of India here demanded that a comprehensive investigation be initiated against Mr. Anvar in the light of the allegations raised by the Collector.

The SDPI said that the Collector’s allegations were serious, and that the MLA should step down from his post until the allegations are proven wrong. The CPI too found fault with Mr. Anvar, and demanded that the allegations against him be looked into.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mla-collector-standoff-heading-for-a-showdown/article30526828.ece
166,2020/01/09,SHSR will throw up investment avenues,"The proposed 532-km Thiruvananthapuram-Kasaragod Semi High Speed Rail (SHSR) corridor project titled ‘Silverline’ will throw up big investment opportunities for the private sector, besides creating a fast and clean travel option across the State, V. Ajith Kumar, Managing Director, Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL), has said.

Showcasing the ₹66,405-crore project at ASCEND 2020 Kerala, he said the project would provide ample investment opportunities in areas that range from civil and electrical contracts to tourism and hospitality business.

There are investment opportunities in Transit Oriented Developments (TOD) and Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) contracts worth ₹38,000 crore for civil, electrical and system works, supply and operation of rail coaches, high speed freight and tourist trains, renewal power generation of around 300 MW, and power storage systems, Mr. Ajith Kumar said.

The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that will be formed as part of the project would set apart a substantial stake for the private sector and a wide array of related businesses and services, he said at a panel discussion on Mobility Development and Electric Vehicles.

A joint venture of the State government and the Ministry of Railways, the project has been cleared by the State Cabinet and also received in-principle approval of the Ministry of Railways.

The green project also promises a set of long-term benefits such as sharp reduction in road congestion and automobile pollution.

Public transportation

In a related session, participants demanded that the public transportation system should be given incentives, while introducing e-vehicles in the State. “The future of transportation lies in e-vehicles and hydrogen vehicles. We hope that the introduction of e-vehicles for public transport system can be done in collaboration with private sector players through tie-ups in the franchisee model,” said K.R. Jyothilal, Principal Secretary, Transport.

Vice president of corporate affairs of Hyundai Motors Datta B.C. said that Kerala must set up a battery-manufacturing unit, since it was shifting to the e-vehicle mode.

167,2020/01/09,Wage subsidy for new investors soon: CM,"The State government is readying a scheme to extend wage subsidy to new investors for a five-year period from April on the basis of the number of people they give employment, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

This is primarily aimed at providing employment to 36 lakh unemployed people in Kerala.

The government wanted to weed out unemployment in 10 years through skill development and other means, he said after inaugurating the two-day ASCEND 2020, a global investors’ meet, here on Thursday.

ESI and PF benefits

Without going into the details, he said the benefit would be available only to enterprises that provided ESI and PF benefits to workers.

Women employees would get at least ₹2,000 more than their men counterparts under the scheme. Mr. Vijayan said the government would soon allow women to work during night hours from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. This is part of the efforts to further empower women. The employer would be responsible for their safety and transportation. This apart, local bodies would have to provide jobs to at least five people per 1,000 population.

Land-ceiling relaxation

The 15-acre ceiling on landholding will be relaxed for investments that are worth over ₹250 crore and provide employment to at least 1,000 people.

Similarly, the ceiling on financial aid from the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation (KSIDC) would be raised from ₹35 crore to ₹100 crore. In certain cases, the KSIDC could provide higher amount, the Chief Minister said. A Chief Secretary-led committee has been constituted to enable a smooth, hassle-free and transparent path to invest in Kerala. There are district-level investment promotion facilitation cells too.

Emphasis on tourism

An e-platform-based single-window clearance system has been set up to catalyse investment. Renewed emphasis would be given to create more jobs in the tourism and health sectors. Nearly 1,500 acres of land had been identified in Palakkad as part of the Kochi-Coimbatore industrial corridor, he said.

The government wants to make Kerala among the five best investor-friendly States in India. Already, investors can begin operating within 30 days of submitting application under the deemed-licence system.

The government would adopt the method relied on by BPCL to redress labour grievances to avert strikes, Mr. Vijayan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/utzz8m/article30527758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TVASCENDCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wage-subsidy-for-new-investors-soon-cm/article30524947.ece
168,2020/01/09,Centre pushing State to financial crisis: Isaac,"A major cut in Central transfers will lead to a shortfall of ₹8,330 crore in the last leg of the current financial year and that will derail the State’s finances and further deepen the crisis, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said.

Dr. Isaac told reporters here on Thursday that as per the budget estimates, the State was eligible for a loan of ₹10,233 crore in the last quarter, but it had been reduced to ₹1,920 crore. This was against the ₹3,200 crore sanctioned for the last quarter in the previous year. The State would also have to repay ₹4,615 crore as principal and interest of the loans availed of so far.

Loan slashed

Against a loan of ₹19,500 crore the State received in the last financial year, it had been slashed to ₹16,602 crore in 2019-20. About 50% of the State’s income was derived from the divisible pool of Central taxes, grants and loans, the Minister said.

The Centre was also cutting grants too. The Goods and Services Tax compensation for December amounting to about ₹1,600 crore had not yet been sanctioned.

It had already been indicated that the State’s share from the Central taxes amounting to ₹6,866 crore given in the last leg of the previous financial year might be reduced to ₹4,524 crore this year.

Arrears mounting

The arrears in Centrally sponsored schemes were also mounting. A sum of ₹1,215 crore due under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme had yet not been cleared. The same applied in the case of the ₹1,035 crore due for paddy procurement. The Centre had excluded the State from the assistance granted for flood relief and rehabilitation, Dr. Isaac said.

The cut in annual borrowing limit of the State had also dealt a major blow to the State. Lack of clarity and uncertainty on Central assistance were thwarting the State from working out a plan for managing the available resources, he said.

Hence, the government had decided to clear the pending bills of accredited agencies, local bodies and contractors from the treasury in the third week of January through a bill discounting system, the Minister added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/centre-pushing-state-to-financial-crisis-isaac/article30524548.ece
169,2020/01/09,"ASI killing: Kerala, TN police launch joint search for two ‘radicalised’ suspects","The Kerala and Tamil Nadu police have launched a joint search for two “radicalised” youth suspected of fatally shooting a Tamil Nadu ASI, Wilson, 56, at the Kaliakkavila inter-State border check-post here late on Wednesday.

The police are treating the shooting as a terrorist incident.

The armed suspects are believed to be at large in Kerala. The State police have put their armed commandos, Kerala Thunderbolts, on standby for interdiction of the fugitives, if required.

The Q-branch of the T.N. police is currently on a stakeout in a coastal neighbourhood in Thiruvananthapuram, where they believe the accused had taken refuge.

A warren of narrow streets marks the densely populated locality. The Kerala police are backing the ongoing operation. They have announced a reward for those who provide information that would lead to the arrest of the suspects.

The Kerala police circulated the pictures of the youth in the media. They identified the main accused as Abdul Shameem of Thiruvithancodu in Thukalay police station limits.

He is a suspect in the “communal murder of a Hindu leader” in Chennai in 2014, according to the T.N. police.

The police identified the second “assailant” as Thoufiq of Ilangkadai in Nagercoil police station limits. Investigators said he had figured as an accused in a case relating to the attempted murder of a BJP leader in Kanniyakumari district in 2017.

The Kerala police said initial reports from their counterparts in T.N. suggested the youth were part of a 12-member gang of radicalised youth involved in covert martial and weapon training in a remote seaside locality in Kanniyakumari. They frequently visited Thiruvananthapuram and had relatives and associates in the town.

Earlier arrest

The Karamana police here had arrested Shameem on the charge of cruelty to animals in 2012. They enlarged him on conditional bail, and he was required to report at the station every week for several months.

Investigators said the youth appeared to resent intrusive monitoring of their activities and inspection of their homes by the Kanniyakumari police.

The police suspect that the youth wanted to send a warning to deter the T.N. police by targeting one of their officers. The suspects possibly found a “soft target of opportunity” in Assistant Sub Inspector Wilson, who was unarmed and alone at the check-post.

At around 9.30 p.m., two masked intruders entered the check-post room and gunned him down. A preliminary forensic examination concluded that the officer had sustained three fatal bullet wounds. The police recovered three empty shells and two live .32 pistol ammunition from the scene of the crime.

A top official said the ammunition appeared factory made. Video footage of the assailants fleeing the scene showed one of them carrying a handgun. He said investigators inferred from the image that the pistol could be a country-made firearm.

The police said the accused entered the neighbourhood mosque after the shooting and then disappeared. Security cameras sighted them an hour later at Parassala in Kerala.

The use of firearms for killing a police officer has sent ripples across the security agencies.

State Police Chief Loknath Behera said there was no cause for panic and the State police were in control of the situation.

Earlier, Mr Behera closeted himself with State Police Chief, T.N., Jalad K. Tripathy and ADGP, Law and Order, T.N., K. Jayanth Murali and ADGP, Law and Order, Kerala, Sheikh Darvesh Saheb to discuss the situation. Mr Murali later went to Kaliakavila to inspect the scene of the shooting.

The Kerala police are also probing whether the killing was a contract hit carried out at the behest of inter-State smugglers. The open Kerala-T.N. border, with its maze of by-roads and pathways, is a conduit for a range of contraband including ganja, illicit spirit, poultry, river sand, tools and construction-grade steel.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/y4uxg4/article30522655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Parassala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-tn-police-launch-joint-search-for-two-radicalised-youth-suspected-of-killing-policeman/article30522514.ece

171,2020/01/09,Collector flays misusing office for political campaign,"Wayanad District Collector Adeela Abdulla on Wednesday came down heavily against the use of the office of the District Collector for political campaign.

A group of BJP leaders had visited Ms. Adeela on Tuesday as a part of the party’s door-to-door campaign to spread awareness about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and taken a photograph while handing over pamphlets to her.

Soon, the photograph went viral in the social media, including Facebook. “As a District Collector, I received the pamphlets without considering the content in it”, Ms. Adeela told The Hindu. However, it was learned that somebody had used the photograph for misleading the public and launch a political campaign. Meanwhile, some others used the photograph for cyber bullying through social media, she said.

Cases would be registered against those who were misusing the photograph for misleading the public and cyber bullying, she said.

BJP district president Saji Sankar said his party had not misused the photograph for political gain.

172,2020/01/09,A taste of carrom and strike,"A carrom board is placed in the shade of a small tree, and cheers go up as Jason Mielke manages to pocket the red. Briefly, silence reigns as the tall youngster sets his eyes on the black coin near the bottom right-hand corner. He misses, and a collective sigh arises from the autorickshaw drivers, trade union workers and young Americans crowding around the square wooden board.

For a group of visiting American students from the University of Iowa, the general strike called by trade unions on Wednesday provided a taste of what a nation-wide shutdown looks like in India. It also left them with time to hone their skills in the popular Indian table-top game which they had discovered by chance at Panavila Junction.

That the general strike has affected daily life is “very noticeable,” Liam Kelly said from the sidelines, watching Jason and another American take on local “experts” across the board.

“Rest of the time, all the roads are packed. Today (Wednesday) the streets are empty and all the shops are closed. Is the entire country closed down?” the 22-year-old from Illinois wanted to know.

Three-week visit

Liam and Jason are part of a 20-member group specialising in sustainable development studies which is on a three-week visit to India.

Members of the group, put up at a hotel near Panavila, had serendipitously discovered carrom during a stroll and were instantly hooked.

“I have not played it before last Sunday. It is a lot like pool, ‘finger-pool’,” remarked Jason, who is from Iowa.

The group will move on to Kochi after spending two more days here. The recent converts to carrom are also toying with the idea of taking back a board to the U.S.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/h2sfs/article30517657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvtvUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-taste-of-carrom-and-strike/article30517658.ece
173,2020/01/09,"General strike total in district, affects normal life","The 24-hour general strike called by trade unions hit normal life in the district on Wednesday with public transport, including the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) buses, keeping off the roads and shops and establishments remaining shut for the better part of the day.

Barring a few incidents where private vehicles were blocked and shopkeepers asked to down shutters, the strike was incident-free in city and rural areas, the police said. Banks, schools and restaurants remained shut.

Special bus services for Sabarimala pilgrims aside, the KSRTC did not operate services from Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday. “Ten buses conducted service from Thiruvananthapuram to Pampa. No other schedules were operated,” said Rajeev K.R., District Transport Officer, Thiruvananthapuram.

The police ran special services from the central railway station and bus station at Thampanoor to the Government Medical College Hospital, Regional Cancer Centre and the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology.

Rail traffic, however, was not affected. All the trains ran as per schedule, a railway spokesperson said.

The strike brought trade to a standstill with shops and establishments, including the markets, remaining closed. A few shops, however, raised shutters towards the evening.

Low attendance

Almost all government offices wore a deserted look on Wednesday. Attendance at the Secretariat was almost nil except for the presence of a number of senior officers, K.R. Jyothilal, Principal Secretary, General Administration, said. The District Collectorate recorded extremely low attendance on the day, Deputy Collector Anu S. Nair, who is holding the charge of Additional District Magistrate, said.

The general strike paralysed Central government offices in the district, including India Post, Railway Mail Service, Income Tax and AG’s Office, P.V. Rajendran, State general secretary, Confederation of Central Government Employees’ and Workers, said.

The joint council of trade unions took out a mammoth protest against the anti-labour policies of the BJP-led Central government in front of the Secretariat. Trade union leaders, including Elamaram Karim and R. Chandrasekharan, addressed the meeting.

The Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre ran four convoys for transporting its staff to and from the office.

Banking sector

The strike in the banking sector was total. Banking staff owing allegiance to various unions, including the All India Bank Employees’ Association, All India Bank Officers’ Association, and Bank Employees Federation of India, participated in the strike. The staff of Reserve Bank of India took out a rally led by the Reserve Bank Employees’ Association and the Reserve Bank Workers’ Union. The Kerala State Pensioners’ Union also took out marches expressing solidarity with the strike.

The police made special arrangements for transporting 45 university students and teachers from Himachal Pradesh who were stranded in the city due to the strike.

174,2020/01/09,‘Chhapaak’ movie review: Deepika Padukone's movie is an emotional force,"It’s unfair to begin the review of a Meghna Gulzar film with a reference to her father. However, it’s also difficult not to, because Chhapaak’s title track, written by him, has been playing on loop in my head, even a day after having watched the film. “Koi chehra mita ke, aur aankh se hata ke; chandd chheente uda ke jo gaya: Chhapaak se pehchaan le gaya (Someone erased one’s face and turned one invisible, while leaving behind a splatter in the air; Took away the core of one’s being with a mere splash)”— by stringing together a few simple words Gulzar gets to the heart and soul of Laxmi Agarwal’s life, its horrors and struggles and those of many other acid attack survivors like her. “Sab jhulas gaya (Everything got singed)”, is how he ends the song. It is indeed about life turning to ashes for Laxmi (Malti in the film) in the blink of an eyelid but also about how she rises from it, Phoenix-like; how a bottomless tragedy also sets her ashore, helps her find herself.

Even though she may have changed the names of the dramatis personae and made the narrative go back and forth in time, Meghna is scrupulous in following Laxmi’s journey in every possible detail — her own story, the people around her, her relationship with them, the various situations, challenges and dilemmas thrown at her, even the NGO Chhanv Foundation (Chhaya in the film), that she had been a part of, find a place on screen.

Despite the attempt to whip up minor controversies on social media, the perpetrator of the crime— Naeem Khan —doesn’t quite lose his religion or find himself converted to Hinduism in the film. Only his name changes to Babbu aka Bashir Khan. It’s to the credit of the writers— Meghna and Atika Chohan —that religion doesn’t become the defining point or the font of Babbu’s villainy. Nor does Babbu’s religion and community get demonised for his individual wrong doing. It’s a welcome change from the “violent Islamist” trap that recent Bollywood films keep falling into. Save one scene featuring Babbu’s rather evil looking mom, religion is treated in a matter of fact way. The transgressions of Babbu are religion-agnostic; they are to do with his own patriarchal mindset, the warped psyche, male toxicity and overtly possessive streak when it comes to Malti.

There are refreshing, radical departures on other fronts too in Chhapaak. The obvious one is overturning the notion of vanity associated with stardom. In eschewing a linear telling, the film ends up showing the real radiant face of its lead for the longest time, only towards the end. From the very start it doesn’t fight shy of showing the facial impairment caused by an acid attack, in all its unsightliness, with nary any relief. Yet it’s also not exploitative or manipulative. And, it’s to Deepika Padukone’s credit, who one is not used to “seeing” in this manner, that her Malti grows on you and somewhere down the road you cease to notice the disfigurement and take her for the person that she is.

Chhapaak Director: Meghna Gulzar

Cast: Deepika Padukone, Vikrant Massey, Madhurjeet Sarghi

Run time: 123 minutes

Storyline: Based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal and her campaign to stop the sale of acid

The film also has a very real and wonderfully written male character – Amol, the NGO activist and Malti’s friend, confidant and more. Vikrant Massey is spot on in pinning down a modern crusader’s sense of despair, frustrations and cynicism. Only someone as bitter as Amol could very believably spell out the sad hierarchy in the gruesome crimes against women—“Rape ke aage acid attack ki kya pooch (What say does an acid attack case have in front of rape)?” His seeming lack of humour is played off well against Malti's surprisingly sharp, though well-concealed wit. “Acid aap pe nahin, mujh pe phinka hai. Aur mujhe party karni hai (Acid was thrown at me, not you. And I want to party),” she takes the mickey out of the killjoy that he is. Or when she says of his stern ways, “Wo sarkar thodi hain jo unse darein (He is not the government that we should be running scared of him)”. Call it zeitgeist but the film critics at the preview laughed aloud together at the unintended irony of these lines, given the contemporary political context.

The “silent pyaar” between Amol and Malti casts a mellow shade. Malti herself comes across as a subdued person, complete with a shy smile and diffident demeanour. She is a woman of few words and it reflects in the spartan dialogue too.

In a way this is reflective of the film’s muted, low-key appeal at large. The cataclysmic incident later, Malti’s life ahead is all about the basic and the fundamental — several reconstructive surgeries, on going court cases and petition for ban on acid. There are no major troughs and ridges and the writers desist from injecting any additional drama into things either. The endemic societal patriarchy gets a throwaway, casual reference like the cop balking at the phone numbers of “boys” stored in Malti’s mobile, or in the scepticism about the case ever getting registered.

The script keeps moving, doesn’t dwell too long and pointedly at any juncture to stress on any point. Whether it’s the brother’s friends calling Malti a ghost worthy of being packed off to a circus or she packing away her jewellery because she doesn’t have the ears or nose to sport them on or sharing a candid, fun togetherness with her father who is drinking on the sly. Everything flows on.

It’s this sparseness, minimalism and austerity in the telling and an essential quietude that lend Chhapaak an emotional force of its own though some may end up finding it measured to a fault. The only excess the film indulges in, is FabIndia. The wardrobe of almost every character/actor appears to have been sourced from the store. And that makes for quite a visual splash.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7e5j00/article30526266.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chhapaak01,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chhapaak-movie-review-deepika-padukones-movie-is-an-emotional-force/article30526270.ece
175,2020/01/09,"‘My choices are on the strength of story, not gender,' says 'Chhapaak' director Meghna Gulzar","Almost five years after Talvar (with a Raazi in the middle) filmmaker Meghna Gulzar is set to present yet another cinematic take on a real life story, that of the acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal. Meghna is parked at the Taj Lands End, Bandra, on a day crammed with interviews for Chhapaak. “It’s like that when you are leading up to putting your film out there,” she says in a hushed voice sitting in one corner of a huge hall that’s being set up for TV interactions. With little time on hand for small talk and pleasantries we launch straight into the questions:

Whose idea was it to make a film on acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal?

It was my idea. I wrote the script in 2016 after Talvar. I was looking for [such] subjects because Talvar was my first film on true life [incident]. Raazi was nowhere in the ether at that time. I came across this issue of acid violence. I collaborated with my co-writer Atika Chohan. When you start researching on acid violence Laxmi Agarwal’s case comes to the fore because it’s a landmark case for many reasons. We put a structure based on the information in public domain, and then we reached out to her to get her agreement on doing this. Once she agreed we spent time with her where we just let her speak and tell her story so that we could then supplement our own structure with her narrative. Then meeting other players in the story—her lawyer, her surgeon, her father’s employer. After Raazi, I realised let’s make Chhapaak when I reached out to Deepika [Padukone] last year.

But why did you have to put it on hold after Talvar?

I didn’t put it on hold. Raazi just surfaced. Talvar and Chhapaak are very similar in terms of the worlds. Both are Delhi-based, both are on an act of violence. I thought it would get kind of monotonous to do this. Raazi just came and took a life of its own. It came together in a year-and-a half — from scripting to release. You don’t plan these things. Scripts have their own destiny.

What is about real life incidents that is challenging to you as a filmmaker?

[A] couple of things actually. One, strong stories which have a purpose. Story can be strong but does it have resonance? Strong characters which could be role models or could be negative but they need to be strong. Third thing: my own instinctive reaction to the story is actually the moot point. If I instinctively get grabbed by the story—oh god, this is the story I want to tell—then all other considerations become secondary.

How easy was it to get Deepika to agree for this?

Instant. Most unexpected and a very very beautiful surprise. I am guessing it’s [to do with] the story and the significance of it. I just met her, the narration I gave her three months later.

Was she the first choice?

The only one. I would have come to a Plan B had she said no but at that point it wasn’t like first her then her and her. It was just her.

Where do you intervene as a filmmaker when you are dealing with the real world? It couldn’t have been a documentary, right? Where has the fiction come into play?

I think only in the narrative order, where you play with the screenplay. You try to tell it in a non-linear order, you try to tell it in an aesthetic way so your cinematography, costume, production design. You play with the tools that you have at your disposal. You use the cinematic tools effectively, but you don’t touch the authenticity of the facts. That’s my principle as a filmmaker.

Is it different from Talvar in terms of the interpretations of facts?

Not at all. There was no interpretation of facts in Talvar except for fictionalising the names and places.

I didn’t mean you as a filmmaker but the Rashomon-like situation in the public domain…

That was the inherent nature of the case. You had one crime, one set of victims but two investigative teams, two theories, two perpetrators, two sets of murder weapons. That was the inherent factual nature of the case. We presented it exactly like that. The difference was that one side got amplified in the media over the other. In the film we laid it out evenly.

Was Chhapaak easier than Talvar then?

No, it wasn’t. They are as complex and as challenging in their own right.

We celebrated Raazi as this women-led ₹100 crore film. How easy or difficult has your life become after that tag?

I think the path got easier after Talvar. It was also a commercial success, considering what it was made at and what it earned. It started from there. Two things play a part here. One is, of course, the success of your previous film. Second, what is the cinematic environment at that time. When studios, actors, producers [believe] in slightly unconventional content or content that is not templated and the audience is also appreciating and accepting it, then it becomes easier to tell an unconventional story. And, of course, [the] success of your previous film works in tangent with that.

What is your own view about this ₹100 crore notion of success?

The notion of success is not important for me as are two things. One, is the appreciation and validation of the people you are making the film for. I’d be lying if I say it’s not [important]. It’s a significant part of your creative journey. You can’t be so dismissive of the audience you are making the film for. Otherwise why are you making it, if you don’t want people to like it. Two is to redeem the faith and investment of people who have invested in you is also a responsibility I take. It’s a lot of people’s hard work and money that goes into making a film. Nobody sets out to make a failure. We all want our films to do well. But will I let it distort my approach, sensibility, craft to tailor a successful film? No. Nobody knows what makes a successful film. If we knew every film would be a success.

Do women protagonists come subconsciously to you?

It’s an interpretation of the media. Filhaal was not about two women protagonists; it was about surrogacy. Surrogacy cannot happen without a man. Just Married was about an arranged marriage which cannot happen without men. Talvar was an investigative procedural whose lead was Irrfan Khan. Then there was Raazi which was more about human sacrifice. Sehmat could very well have been a 19-year-old boy. It was not as though, it was a boy but I made it a girl because I wanted to tell a female-oriented story. My choices are based on the strength and potency of the story and the characters, and has very little to do with the gender.

Yet we do talk of more women taking centre stage in filmmaking…

Yes, it’s very nice to have the number of female technicians increase in the filmmaking process but if you ask me having more good films, scripts, content, performances is far more significant than having more female directors, writers. Creativity is not a gender thing at all.

Talvar divided your career into pre and post phase…

I always say that it’s my rebirth as a filmmaker. The genre changed completely. The craft changed. When I came into Talvar, the technology of filmmaking had changed entirely. I had to calibrate accordingly. I have calibrate my craft according to the story I am telling. I [could not] execute Talvar the way I executed Filhaal and I [could not] execute Raazi the way I executed Talvar. Talvar is set in 2005, Raazi is set in 1971.

What you have now is contemporary…

Then I will go back to 1920. The Sam Manekshaw film. Vicky [Kaushal] is playing the part. RSVP is producing it. I require nine months to a year of prep. Particularly for the kind of film it is, [and] the kind of detailing and research that is required. We start production in 2021. I do need a break for a couple of months to [work] Chhapaak out of my system. I have lived with something for a year-and-a-half. It can’t snap out on the day of release. It takes its own process.

Are you again collaborating on the Maneckshaw film?

I love collaborating. I love the energy that pours into a script in collaborating. It’s the flow and exchange of ideas. You know the domino effect, how the dominoes start falling. Sitting with my writers is just the opposite. The scenes start standing. They start getting populated. It’s just banter through which it happens. For [the] Maneckshaw film I am collaborating with Bhavani Iyer of Raazi and Shantanu Srivastava who wrote Badhaai Ho.

So you bounce ideas off each other?

We talk and make notes of what we have agreed on and then one person will structure it and it will come to the next for another layer and then to the third for another layer. Then we put it all together and circulate it. Every sequence is actually going through three passes. Very [rarely do] you have your semi-final draft in your first draft itself.

But writing is largely seen to be such an individual, isolating experience…

Not just writing, filmmaking is a collaborative process. It’s not an isolated, individual thing at all.

Does writing and research take the longest for you as a filmmaker?

With my last two films the research-writing, the production and the post production have been even in duration.

Chhapaak is also a collaboration as a producer. Your company is co-producing with Deepika’s and Fox Star. How does that help?

You have a larger army supporting and backing the film. You have larger manpower resource also, more minds. The support system is to be grateful for.

Are you very disciplined as a filmmaker?

I would like to think so. It’s important for me to have everything streamlined, discussed, regulated with everybody and put on paper, then we follow a shared schedule, plan and idea. It makes the process easier on everybody. Everybody is on the same page. It streamlines and makes it quicker.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/lcqqg5/article30525676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DSC7618,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/my-choices-are-on-the-strength-of-story-not-gender-says-chhapaak-director-meghna-gulzar/article30525677.ece
176,2020/01/09,"Actor by day, cab driver by night: Aaryavardhan awaits the release of Kannada film 'Crush'","It’s possible that you might recognise actor Aaryavardhan, known as Aarya. He may have even driven you around the city. An actor by day, he drives a cab at night.

While Rangabirangi (2017), directed by Mallikarjun, was his debut as a leading man, the film did not do as expected at the box office. Soon the film was forgotten and so was Aarya. While some actors take to the small screen to sustain themselves, Aarya did not want to do so. “I did get a few offers for serials. It would have helped me financially and helped me get fame. But right now, it is films that I am passionate about.”

For a year-and-a-half after his debut film, Aarya was unsure of his next offer in the film industry and was also struggling to make ends meet. “That was when my friend, who runs a cab service in the city, gave me his car and also a job in his company. Now I act and audition for new roles during the day and work as a cab driver at night.”

Aarya is not one to give up on his dreams. Despite a lot of opposition from his family, this rank holder quit his studies (he is a BCom student) and stayed back in Bengaluru to get into films. “I got involved in theatre when I was studying in Coorg and by the time I came to Bengaluru, my heart was just not in my studies. Nor did I want to go back home. As I didn’t want to bother my family with my financial needs, I started working as a cab driver in my free time.”

While doing theatre, Aarya worked with National School of Drama graduate Basavalingaiah and has travelled across the state performing with his troupe and has done “42 shows” before “venturing into films”.

Hailing from north Karnataka, the young actor is now busy completing the dubbing of his next film Crush, directed by first-time director Abhi. “Though this film is a college romance, it has a lot of laughter in it. It is also special as I get to share the screen with veteran actor Abhinaya,” he says.

As Aarya waits for the release, he has undergone a makeover for his next role. He cut off his curls and says, “I will also grow a bread as the character is supposed to be a tough guy. The character may also have a few tattoos,” he laughs“

His other film set for release is Ide Antharang Shuddhi, directed by Kumardutt, which he describes as a romantic story with “lots of fights and stunts”.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/s1lotc/article30523679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10bgmaryaJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-by-day-cab-driver-by-night-aaryavardhan-awaits-the-release-of-kannada-film-crush/article30523680.ece
177,2020/01/09,Kiran G Nath’s biopic on Kalamandalam Hyderali celebrates his grit,"There is an incident in the late seventies that, in a way, summarises Kalamandalam Hyderali’s journey in Kathakali. Festival committee members of Thalathotta temple in Haripad had invited the Kathakali musician par excellence for a recital. However, tradition decreed that only Hindus be allowed inside the temple premises. To ensure that Hyderali sang, the compound wall was demolished and the stage extended. As a result, technically, although Hyderali remained outside the temple precincts, his fans ensured that the late maestro did sing for the recital inside the temple. It was just another hurdle in the eventful career of Hyderali, a star among Kathakali musicians.

Moved by the life and times of Hyderali, cinematographer and ad film maker Kiran G Nath decided to make his debut as a director with a biopic on the Kathakali musician. Speaking on phone from Kochi, he says that he had always been drawn towards Hyderali’s career as a musician in a tradition-bound art like Kathakali with strong feudalistic and ritualistic mooring. “Here was someone whose only calling card was his immense talent. No one could push him aside because of his gifted voice. Although he suffered a lot of discrimination, it is also true that there were greats like Kalamandalam Gopi who supported him and helped him mark his space among the greats of Kathakali vocalists,” says the director.

Son of mappilapattu singer Moidutty, Hyderali’s flair for music and economic necessity took him to Kalamandalam, the bastion of traditional art forms of Kerala. Although hounded by the orthodoxy and the casteism that were still prevalent in Kalamandalam in those days, Hyderali prevailed and completed the course.

“Nevertheless, he had to go through several trials and tribulations to practise what he had learnt because Kathakali was still a ritualistic temple art form in many places in Kerala. Since many of the temples were out of bounds for non-Hindus, Hyderali had to struggle to gain a foothold. Nevertheless, there were many who came to his rescue and thanks to MKK Nair, a patron of arts, he was able to get a job in the Kathakali school run by FACT,” narrates Kiran.

His travails and eventual success as a celebrity singer had enthused many filmmakers to plan a biopic on the singer but none of them were able to get it rolling. “In my case, when I decided to make a biopic on the musician, I was able to strike a rapport with his biographer, Vijayan sir, and Hyderali sir’s family. They told me of many incidents and struggles in his life that were not in the public domain. When I heard all that, I felt that his was a life that needed to be documented and shared with a large audience. It is relevant to the times we live in and will force each of us to introspect,” explains Kiran.

Scripted by Aju K Narayanan, the film with Renji Panicker in the lead role of Kalamandalam Hyderali reaches cinemas today. With its accent on music, the movie traces the musician’s journey to the limelight. “It is a musical biography of a youngster from a lower middle class Muslim family who captivated discerning Kathakali viewers with his evocative rendering and became a star in his own right,” says Kiran.

Finding a producer for such a subject was not easy. Kiran managed to get his film rolling thanks to Vinesh Mohan who has produced the film under the banner of Vedhas Creations. “I was lucky to get a team that put their heart and soul into the film. Renji’s dedication was inspiring and his son Nikhil Renji Panicker plays the young Kalamandalam Hyderali while Reihan Hyderali, the maestro’s grandson himself, appears in the part depicting Hyderali’s childhood. Paris Laxmi, Meera Nair, Ashokan and TG Ravi are some of the actors in the film. Moreover, this was perhaps ace cinematographer MJ Radhakrishnan’s last work for a feature film. To ensure that the music was authentic, I turned to leading Kathakali vocalist Kottakkal Madhu and Anil Gopalan for the music. Kottakkal Madhu has also rendered the padams. Sreevalsan J Menon has composed and sung the famous padam ‘Enthiha manmanase’ from Karnashapatham,” adds Kiran.

Shot in Kalamandalam, Thrikkadeeri in Palakkad and Haripad, the film, which was two years in the making, depicts real incidents. Nothing has been fictionalised or added to enhance the narrative or make it melodramatic, emphasises the director. According to him, the maestro had to undergo so many trials and tribulations that there was no need to spice it up for any dramatic effect. “From childhood, he had experienced a lot of discrimination. He had mentioned in his biography how during the lunch break in Kalamandalam and in class, there would be sufficient space on either side of him to accommodate another student. That was the kind of difficulties he had to endure and surmount,” he narrates.

Despite the many hurdles that were created to prevent him from singing during his lifetime, the film does not make him out to be a tragic hero. It is a tribute to his determination and how his musicality saw him conquer the hearts of all people who enjoyed Kathakali. Says Kiran: “Hyderali maash was a celebrity whose voice and talent immortalised him. His life and career are an intrinsic part of the spirit of renaissance of Kerala and now it is important to remember greats like him who refused to let his talent or life be hemmed in by walls of religion and caste.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/82f607/article30523607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvmKalamandalamHyderali,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kiran-g-naths-biopic-is-on-kathakali-musician-kalamandalam-hyderali/article30523612.ece
178,2020/01/09,"Sushanth opens up on why he signed ‘Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo’, and life after ‘Chi La Sow’","Actor Sushanth says things have come full circle with Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (AVPL), releasing on January 12. This is the first time he’s not playing the main protagonist, but he talks about having gained a lot of experience working with director Trivikram Srinivas and a star cast that includes Allu Arjun, Tabu, Jayaram, Pooja Hegde and Nivetha Pethuraj.

The onus of box office collections aren’t on his shoulders, and he doesn’t mind it. “I thought about this film as an actor rather than a hero. But I worked more days on this set than I’ve done for some of my solo hero projects,” he declares.

After the warm reception to the romance Chi La Sow through which Sushanth reinvented himself, everyone expected him to announce more solo hero projects. He took everyone by surprise when the news trickled out that he’s been signed by Trivikram for a part in this Allu Arjun starrer.

Sushanth had already heard another story titled Ichata Vahanamulu Nilupa Radu (No Parking) pitched to him by first-timer Darshan. He liked the story but felt the script needed more work. Meanwhile, when AVPL came his way, he didn’t want to let go. “This is the first time I got to work with such a reputed director and I got to learn new things about myself. I need to thank both Trivikram sir and Bunny (Allu Arjun). Trivikram, from what I’ve observed, gauges the traits of an actor within a short time and designs the character accordingly. He works on your strengths and nudges you to step out of your comfort zone,” says Sushanth.

A still from Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo

Though questions were raised about him not doing a solo hero project and capitalising on the reception to Chi La Sow, Sushanth stayed quiet because it was too soon to announce Ichata Vahanamulu Nilupa Radu. This film was launched a few days ago and shooting will begin towards the end of this month. He’s confident that it will work for the better: “AVPL will give me more visibility and that, I hope, will help my next project.”

On the sets of AVPL, he would observe the cast closely. “We shot several portions at a house set in Annapurna Seven Acres. Just watching actors like Bunny, Tabu and Jayaram at close quarters was so good. Chaitu (Naga Chaitanya) and I had stayed in Tabu’s house in Mumbai for nearly a month when we were aspiring actors and had taken up an acting course. I first met her when she was shooting for Ninne Pelladata. To be working with her feels like I’ve come full circle,” he says.

Sushanth won’t talk about his role in AVPL but discloses that he got to experiment with “a couple of different looks”, and adds, “After the first narration, I was convinced and blindly followed what Trivikram sir said. I watched a few important scenes while dubbing but haven’t seen the final edit, but I can say that mine isn’t a predictable role. I have scenes with most of the cast and my work can hopefully be a mini showreel for potential filmmakers and the audience as well.”

In the last two years, if Sushanth has come across as more confident and assured, he says he decided to look beyond setbacks and work with a new approach. He talks about having been through fluctuating and testing times until around 2017: “My family tends to give all of us the freedom to be independent in our choices. I’m thankful for that but there was someone from the outside who wasn’t a good influence on me during most of my initial career. Having said that, I take responsibility for being influenced in the first place,” he says, without wanting to take names. “I learnt to move away, become independent and make my own decisions. That changed everything.”

Chi La Sow may have been a small film but the fact that it fetched a National Award for Best Screenplay for its writer-director Rahul Ravindran made it a good project to be a part of. Sushanth could discern new-found respect even in known circles: “I felt my journey has been worth it, to return from the US after my education and take up films.”

Things are looking up on the professional front. “More quality scripts come to me today, and with AVPL, I am sending out a signal that I am not following a fixed pattern but am flexible both as an actor and a hero depending on the project. I am curious and excited,” he sums up.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/msvt5q/article30522891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sushanth-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sushanth-opens-up-on-why-he-signed-ala-vaikunthapurramuloo-and-life-after-chi-la-sow/article30522895.ece
179,2020/01/09,'Tanhaji’ can serve as a strong inspiration for the youth: Ajay Devgn,"Om Raut’s “Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior” is based on the life of the 17th century Maratha warrior Tanhaji Malusare who led an army that successfully captured the Kondhana fort from a Rajput fort keeper named Udaybhan Singh Rathore. Said to be fought during the night of February 4, 1670, the Battle of Sinhagad brought Tanaji, a warrior in Shivaji’s army against Rathore, who was working under the command of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. Noted actor Ajay Devgn, who plays the film’s eponymous character, is also one of the film’s producers.

“When we make films we look for subjects that can engage the audience. When I heard Tanhaji’s story it made me realise that such big sacrifices have been made by people which we can’t think of. He fought bravely against the might of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. But, the people in the north don’t know much about him,” says Devgn, committed to making more films about unsung regional Indian heroes as part of the ‘unsung warriors’ series.

Story of sacrifice

Devgn believes that the sacrifice made by Tanhaji can serve as a strong inspiration for the youth. “Tanhaji sacrificed himself for the freedom of his people. But we often take freedom for granted. The story of Tanhaji is a reminder that we owe it to our country and our society. If everyone starts caring a little, it can make a huge difference,” avers Devgn, expressing concern on the ongoing student protests in the country.

“Frankly, it’s not a great situation to be in for the country. I think in a democracy things should be sorted out through dialogue. The establishment has the right to take its decisions and the people have the right to protest peacefully. So, the only solution is to sit together and discuss it out so that it can be settled amicably,” opines Devgn.

Seen as a supporter of the present dispensation, Devgn says he doesn’t like to be seen as a supporter of any political party. “I have no links to any political party. Also, I have no plans of joining politics in life. When I feel that some good work is happening, I support it. If I don’t like something, I share my opinion. And when I am not too sure, I usually keep quiet,” explains Devgn.

After “Shivaay”, he has once again spent heavily on special effects. Fond of trying new things, Devgn reminds that he has been doing it since “Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha”. “I feel access to bigger budgets and better technology has made it possible for Indian filmmakers to make lavish period films.”

Director’s take

The basis of Tanhaji is the strong research done by director Om Raut and his team of writers. “I was in the US when Zack Snyder’s ‘300’ came out. When I watched the film, I was blown away by the bravery of King Leonidas in the war field. I got out of the theatre in New York and I said to myself that there are so many amazing stories that we have in our motherland that we need to showcase to the world. And the first name that came to mind was Subedar Tanhaji Malusare because I have been hearing about his bravery from my grandparents and parents since when I was a child,” reveals Raut who started his research on Tanhaji back in 2015, following the release of his first film “Lokmanya Ek Yugpurush”.

The first step for Raut was to get the script right. “It was important to get the core foundation right. So it was about reading books, meeting with historians, visiting the actual places, going through the paintings of the time, etc. Once the script was ready, the next challenge was to actually create the world of Tanhaji, Unfortunately, the forts are completely in ruins. So, we took pictures of the ruins in many different ways. We did aerial photography and also brought some scanners to do the architectural scan of the location. We brought all that data back into our office and tried to create a vision on top of it. So that’s how we succeeded in recreating the Kondhana fort,” recollects Raut.

The extensive research allowed Raut and the team to pay attention to the minutest of the details. “We paid great attention to the type of cannons employed, the various varieties of spears, and the different kinds of swords wielded by the different warriors at the time. A foot soldier’s sword is very different from that of a horse rider who needs a much longer sword. Also, the Marathas were not very tall and so their swords were bent to match their speeds as opposed to the tall Mughals who used a long sword with a thicker blade. We don’t have funny weapons like the ones we have seen in some films. The weapons that we have used in Tanhaji are all real and they were actually there. So, it’s no fiction,” sums up Raut.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/unyoow/article30522576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10DFR,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tanhaji-can-serve-as-a-strong-inspiration-for-the-youth-ajay-devgn/article30522577.ece
180,2020/01/09,"Director Siddique on working with Mohanlal in 'Big Brother', and balancing content and budget in cinema","Siddique, along with Lal with whom he directed many hits, is regarded as one of the trendsetters of comedy in Malayalam cinema.

After making his entry into movies from the mimicry stage, Siddique, who made his directorial début with Ramji Rao Speaking in 1989, has made his presence felt in Tamil and Hindi as well. The filmmaker is now ready with Mohanlal-starrer Big Brother that releases next week.

In an interview with FridayReview, Siddique opens up on his stint as a filmmaker and why he prefers commercial cinema to art-house films. Excerpts...

Your early comedies such as Ramji Rao Speaking, In Harihar Nagar, Godfather, Vietnam Colony and Hitler continue to appeal to film buffs...

To be honest, we never imagined that our films would go on to appeal to a new generation of viewers as well. I feel the attention to detail helps viewers find something new each time they watch the film.

Director Siddique | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Your stories usually start on a humorous note and then turn serious...

If you take a closer look, the storylines are actually all serious. It’s just that the treatment is different with varying doses of humour. For instance, Ramji Rao Speaking is based on a kidnapping, In Harihar Nagar is a murder mystery and Godfather is a love story in the ‘Romeo and Juliet’ mould.

How would you evaluate the evolution of comedies in Malayalam cinema?

Malayalam has a rich heritage in terms of comedy. Our literature had geniuses such as Kunchan Nambiar. But comedies were not really a successful genre until movies such as Nadodikkattu brought in a difference. From then on, more comedies were made in tune with the social conditions and the mindset of that period.

After Vietnam Colony (1992) and Ladies and Gentleman (2013), you are teaming up with Mohanalal again. What changes do you see in the actor?

Mohanlal’s growth as an actor has been phenomenal. On a commercial level too, the stature of his movies has reached new heights from the time we associated with each other. Expectations are huge now. Big Brother will live up to it.

Hitler was about an older brother who is overprotective of his sisters. How different is Big Brother?

For that matter, even Chronic Bachelor was about a brother’s affection for his sister. Big Brother is different from those stories. The character played by Mohanlal is the saviour of a family but that is the only similarity with the previous films.

As one grows older, is it more challenging to create stories that connect with the viewers of the time?

It’s never easy and requires thorough research and observation. The milieu we live in keeps changing and so do the viewers, which means the treatment has to be topical. Having said that, basic storylines and cinematic grammar, by and large, remain the same.

Is there an attempt by filmmakers to make movies that appeal to viewers in other languages too, considering the profits to be made from remakes?

Not from my side. I make stories only for Malayalam. But I believe that my stories have an outlook that has made it acceptable in other languages as well. The strength of a plot can take it beyond boundaries. For instance, Bodyguard became a huge success when it was remade in Tamil and Hindi.

How do you see the shift in focus from content to crore clubs and big budgets?

Nowadays, it is a fact that the value of a movie is often gauged by the numbers that the movie attracts than the content. I feel that while making a movie, the filmmaker has to be sure whether it is a commercial or an offbeat one and also keep in mind the target audience.

What’s your take on awards ?

Godfather was considered for the National awards in the best popular film category. But the jury decided not to give the award that year. After that, I usually don’t send my movies for awards.

Are younger actors reluctant to work with senior filmmakers?

Yes. By doing so, the younger crop of actors is not using the chance to explore a different terrain with the experienced lot.

They don’t realise that they too may face a similar rejection at a later stage. There is also an orchestrated campaign on social media against movies made by senior technicians.

Looking back at your former association with Lal, which came to known as the ‘Siddique-Lal’ duo...

I have only fond memories about our association. We have benefited from working as a team and we took the decision to go on our own at the right time.

You have attained success making comedies. Is there a pressure to stick to a pattern?

I don’t think about all of that. My attempt has been to narrate the best story at that point of time. I believe I have done the same with Big Brother too.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3tnbk2/article30512283.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvfSiddiquenMohanlalinBigBrother,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-siddique-on-upcoming-mohanlal-film-big-brother-and-balancing-content-and-budget-in-cinema/article30512285.ece

Meanwhile, dance numbers Chumma Kizhhi and Marana Mass are blasting from the speakers. Make no mistake, Darbar is here, and Rajinikanth has arrived: as a bad cop, no less.

The buzz surrounding the actor’s films might have come down considerably over the last few years or so, but that isn’t stopping his hardcore fans from thronging the cinema halls during release. Lile Suresh T, a 35-year-old who arrived sporting a black T-shirt that had the lettering ‘Vanthu Ninna Darbar’ on it. “There’s no way I’m missing a Rajini film first day first show,” he says, admiring a poster of the star wielding a sword, “We fans aren’t here for the storyline or the screenplay. We are here to celebrate the aura behind Superstar.”

It’s the love of fans like him that has made Rajinikanth FDFS’ successful, despite the entry of stars like Vijay and Ajith, whose films are also celebrated with a lot of vigour and passion. “Can anyone be more stylish than him?” gushes M Ezhil, getting out of Parangimalai’s Jothi theatre with a ‘thumbs up’ sign, “The man is almost 70, but he’s still giving his all for dance and fight sequences. We will continue supporting his films, irrespective of what kind of roles he takes up.”

It’s his screen charm that seems to have worked for Rajinikanth till date. Chartered accountant V Sreevathson, also an actor-writer in Tamil theatre troupe Dummies Drama, will vouch for it. He is a regular FDFS-goer, having taken part in such celebrations for the last three decades, in various theatres in the city including Albert, Udhayam and Vettri. “There’s some energy that passes on from the man on screen to me, the viewer. It makes my mornings meaningful,” he says. Thursday morning at Darbar probably did that for many more fans like him.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9xdyl9/article30521609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/c906cbd2-eaf6-45b2-ab40-1d6e190bbb6f,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/watch-darbar-fdfs-a-celebration-of-rajinikanth-fandom-across-chennai/article30521611.ece
185,2020/01/09,Kannada director Venkat Bharadwaj’s next film is a comedy called 'Omelette',"The first thing that hits you is the title of the film — Omelette. We ask the director, Venkat Bharadwaj if we heard the title right. “Yes,” he laughs saying, “I chose the title, because the film is a comedy. And just like an omelette, our lives are also a mishmash of emotions, errors and humour. The other reason is we are fragile as an egg and can be crushed easily. The third reason is we have the ability to come out of problems like an egg when it is cracked open. Omelette is also a most loved breakfast across the world and is a universal word like amma. Every one knows what it is.”

He has cast Samyukta Hornadu, Shobraj and Niranjan Deshpande in lead roles in this film and has also written the story. “There are stories that the middle and the upper middle class connects with. Then there are stories that reaches out to the masses. I feel Omelette will reach out to all these three sections.”

Talking about the plot Venkat says, “It is about an auto driver, his dreams, aspirations and his roller coaster ride in life.” Venkat adds that Omellete was made in a short span of time. “I wrote the story in September 2019 and now we are almost done with the post production work. I had to finish this project as I need to get ready to work on my next film, which will be a crime thriller in Tamil.”

Gururaj Desai has written the dialogues for Omelette and Vishal Ramprasad (a student of Arjun Janya) has composed the music. Venkat says, “Omelette was shot entirely in South Bengaluru. It represents the culture of this city. That is also why we chose Samyukta for the lead."" Venkat plans to release the film this month.

Venkat is the director of Kempirve, which featured Dattanna and Sayaji Shinde in the lead and spoke about the land mafia. The film won the State Award in the best screenplay category. Unarvu in Tamil, was his next venture, which was “released last year in 100 theatres across Tamil Nadu,” the director says with a smile adding that he plans to cast a popular Hindi film actor for his Tamil film.

The as-yet-untitled Tamil film, “is about three young boys,” says Venkat who currently alternates between directing Kannada and Tamil films. In the future he plans to direct a Hindi film. “I like to make off beat films. Today no one is interested in watching a film with 59 dancers dancing behind the hero. You wont even see that in an Akshay Kumar film.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1sdmxq/article30521496.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08bgmomelettejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kannada-director-venkat-bharadwajs-next-film-is-a-comedy-called-omelette/article30521500.ece
186,2020/01/09,Oscars to be held without a host again for 2020 ceremony,"It’s official. The 92nd Academy Awards ceremony will go without a host once again. The Oscars will broadcast on ABC as part of its long-term deal with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science (AMPAS).

According to The Hollywood Reporter, ABC entertainment president Karey Burke made the announcement on Wednesday.

“Let me confirm it now, together with the Academy, that there will be no traditional host this year,” Burke said, emphasising the ceremony would repeat what worked last year.

The development comes three weeks after reports that the AMPAS was contemplating about whether or not to go hostless for a second consecutive year.

In 2019, the Academy went without a host after controversy around actor-comic Kevin Hart’s past homophobic remarks resulted in him stepping down.

Different set of Hollywood names presented different categories, resulting telecast received strong reviews and solid ratings.

187,2020/01/09,‘Darbar’ movie review: A charismatic Rajinikanth shoulders an okayish masala movie,"There is an inexplicable sense of gratification one gets when you watch Rajinikanth having fun on screen, especially when there is little meat involved. It is almost as if Rajini is saying: “Guys, this has been done to death. But this is what you ask of me, so here I am.” Rajinikanth, perhaps, is the only star in Indian cinema who has the power to make a weakly-written script watchable on some level. What has not been said/written about Rajinikanth everytime he flips his hair or puts on sunglasses in his inimitable style, or just takes a casual stroll that has the panache to shatter box-office records? In other words, there is nothing called an ‘unwatchable’ Rajinikanth movie — the decibel level of the audience for his introduction scene in Darbar is a testimony to that.

Darbar teases with newsreels of a “bad cop” called Aaditya Arunasalam (Rajinikanth), much before the customary hero introduction scene. We know who it is and tend to smile at the age-old technique of hold and play. Aaditya is an encounter specialist who goes on a killing rampage in Mumbai. His name sends shudders to the bhais of the underworld. A local don challenges him, paving the way for his entry. It is a superb construct with Anirudh Ravichander’s reworking of the Annamalai background score. But you sense something is missing in it. It definitely has sparks, but lacks fire... which can be said about the movie as a whole.

At the outset, one could argue that Darbar has the longest flashback in the history of Tamil movies released in the last few years; it comes to the present only in the last half hour or so. When Aaditya is deposited to Mumbai for a special task, he smells a drug network. The plot thickens when he discovers that Ajay Malhotra (a clueless Prateik Babbar), who is the son of a powerful businessman, is behind the drug racket. A well-orchestrated encounter leads Adithya to face-off against Hari Chopra (Suneil Shetty), who has a history of incinerating police officers.

Darbar Cast: Rajinikanth, Nayanthara, Nivetha Thomas, Yogi Babu, Prateik Babbar and Suniel Shetty

Director: AR Murugadoss

Storyline: Aaditya Arunasalam is a ruthless police officer who’s only mission is to make Mumbai clean and drug-free

There are too many issues that muddle Darbar from becoming an enjoyable masala movie, starting with Rajinikanth’s name. It is tough to imagine Rajini as Aaditya Arunasalam. Arunasalam, yes. But Aaditya? A name like Suriya would have been more appropriate, no? Another troubling aspect is the way AR Murugadoss uses and abuses the masala genre, with weakly-conceived ideas. For instance, there is a scene involving a proxy character, which is splendidly written and executed. But the pay-off is only satisfactory.

Masala movies had a renaissance period when Murugadoss made back-to-back solid blockbusters :Dheena, Ramana and Ghajini to name a few. He gave a new spin to the genre and reinvented the formula for its own good. What was Murugadoss’ strength up until Thuppakki is turning out to be his weakness. Darbar comes across as if the filmmaker hastily put together individual parts of the screenplay, without developing a sturdy foundation for the script. The film also lacks a strong emotional core, and the reason why you don’t buy into the father-daughter relationship, which is emotionless. A wonderfully cast Nivetha Thomas plays Rajinikanth’s daughter here.

The biggest issue — not with Darbar, but any Rajinikanth movie post Raghuvaran’s death — is the presence of an animated villain. In this case, Suniel Shetty. There is no other way to describe Rajinikanth without thinking about the effect Plutonium has. I am seriously considering the option of filing a petition to find a villain who could match the flamboyance of Rajinikanth. When you find a suitable match, we shall discuss what purpose does Nayanthara serve in the film.

Darbar alters between a masala and mass movie, offering very little substance for the demi-god that is Rajinikanth. It is a yet another depressing case where the star does more to the script than what it does to him. However, here is the flip side to the movie: it is, if anything, a celebration of a man who is nearly 70, and has been entertaining fans for four decades. There is a brief stretch in the second half, where Aaditya literally prepares for the final showdown. This involves Rajinikanth flexing his muscles and lifting heavy weights — reminding you of a dialogue from Padayappa. “What a man,” said Abbas. How true, we wonder.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/2xmcpd/article30521044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Darbar-34,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/darbar-movie-review-a-charismatic-rajinikanth-shoulders-an-okayish-masala-movie/article30521045.ece
188,2020/01/09,‘Chhapaak’ storm: Laxmi Agarwal’s lawyer plans to sue makers of Deepika Padukone film,"Advocate Aparna Bhat, who represented acid attack victim Laxmi Agarwal in court, is upset with the Deepika Padukone-starrer Chhapaak and has threatened to take legal action against the makers of the film.

Chhapaak is based on Laxmi’s life, and Deepika plays a character based on Laxmi in the film. Bhat’s contention is the filmmakers have not given due acknowledgement to her in the film’s credits. The advocate, who played a pivotal role in real life to ensure justice was served to Laxmi in the case fought at Patiala House Courts, took to Facebook and wrote a few posts to vent her ire, and also announce that she would be taking the makers of Chhapaak to court.

Bhat wrote in her Facebook post: “Have never been the one to demand attention to my work. Deeply disturbed by the turn of events post watching Chhapaak. Compelled to take legal action to protect my identity and preserve my integrity. I represented Lakshmi in her criminal trial in Patiala House Courts... tomorrow someone will represent me in my cause...Ironies of life.”

No sooner did she put up a post, there were many people coming out in her support. Overwhelmed by the fact, she wrote another post: “I thank all my friends who endorsed my contribution and challenged team Chhapaak in failing to say even “Thank you!!a. I cannot match the powers of these mighty producers of Bollywood but keeping quiet will further endorse injustice. I have decided to take my cause to the next level. Ready to face the consequences.”

This is the second controversy that has erupted about Chhapaak within the span of a single day. Earlier on Wednesday, social media was flooded with the rumour that the name of the real-life acid attacker was changed from Basheer to Rajesh in the film, in order to protect the culprit’s religious identity. However, pre-release screenings on Wednesday revealed the name of Nadeem has been changed to Basheer.

Wednesday’s controversies over Chhapaak followed Deepika’s visit to Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Tuesday night. She was at JNU as a mark of solidarity with the students who were victims of a violent attack by unidentified masked men on Sunday night.

Deepika’s JNU visit was construed by many as a publicity stunt, and clamour to boycott her new film has been trending online, although a large section of social media has also hailed her gesture.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/o4s3v/article30521017.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/chhapaak-1578486178,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chhapaak-storm-laxmi-agarwals-lawyer-plans-to-sue-makers-of-deepika-padukone-film/article30521018.ece
189,2020/01/09,Brazil judge orders Netflix to remove film with gay Jesus,"A Brazilian judge on Wednesday ordered Netflix to stop showing a Christmas special that some called blasphemous for depicting Jesus as a gay man and which prompted a gasoline bomb attack on the satirists behind the program.

The ruling by Rio de Janeiro judge Benedicto Abicair responded to a petition by a Brazilian Catholic organization that argued the “honor of millions of Catholics” was hurt by the airing of “The First Temptation of Christ.” The special was produced by the Rio-based film company Porta dos Fundos, whose headquarters was targeted in the Christmas Eve attack.

Netflix told it would not comment on the ruling.

Porta dos Fundos also declined to comment on the judge’s decision, which contradicted an earlier decision rejecting censorship of the program. The ruling is valid until another court orders otherwise.

Judge Abicair said the program’s withdrawal “is beneficial not only to the Christian community, but to Brazilian society which is mostly Christian.”

The ruling comes at a time when some civil groups say far-right Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is waging a “cultural war,” cutting funding for arts projects that challenge “Christian values” and inveighing against flamboyant carnival celebrations.

Early on the day before Christmas, a group of hooded men attacked the headquarters of Porta dos Fundos with Molotov cocktails. No one was hurt. A video circulating days later on social media showed three men claiming responsibility for the attack, and said they targeted the Brazilian comedy group.

The First Temptation of Christ depicts Jesus returning home on his 30th birthday and insinuates he is gay. Religious groups bristled at the depiction. Creators of the film have defended it as legitimate freedom of expression.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oatpvz/article30520224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AWARDS-GOLDENGLOBES,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/brazil-judge-orders-netflix-to-remove-film-with-gay-jesus/article30520225.ece

196,2020/01/09,Wind industry in TN worried about poor maintenance of transmission infrastructure,"The Indian Wind Power Association (IWPA) is worried over lack of maintenance of transmission infrastructure in Tamil Nadu and wants immediate action.

“If the lack of maintenance continues for a few years, the wind industry efforts in forecasting, scheduling etc would be of no use,” said A.D. Thirumoorthy, chief technical advisor, IWPA.

In Tamil Nadu, there are 130 substations where wind mills are pre-dominantly connected. Of these, nearly 20 substations are owned, manned and operated by Independent Power Producers. Another 100-odd substations are manned by Tangedco, according to a study by IWPA.

Wind power has to be injected to the main grid, immediately after generation, through the feeders and the sub-stations. “Wind generators are connected to the substation through 11KV or 33KV lines, mostly 33/kv lines and 99% of these are overhead lines. These lines and sub-stations are almost three decades old. If left unattended and unmaintained, frequent faults happen, especially during the high wind season,” Mr. Thirumoorthy pointed out.

Poles, lines and insulators tend to fail during high winds, and breakdown occurs. Identification of the faults and the restoration of LT feeders take up 10 hours, sometimes even days due to lack of manpower, logistics and spares, he pointed out. Such is the condition of about 8500 MW capacity infrastructure in Tamil Nadu, with ₹50,000 crore investments at stake, according to IWPA .

“We pay monthly operation and maintenance charges to maintain the feeders and transformers. For example, in a sub-station we pay more than ₹10 lakh. If atleast 10% of that is spent towards maintenance there will not be any issue,” Mr. Thirumoorthy suggested.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ay1dts/article30521482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WINDTURBINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wind-industry-in-tn-worried-about-poor-maintenance-of-transmission-infrastructure/article30521483.ece

The case is related to the alleged non-disclosure of income for the financial year 2015-16 and evasion of tax.

It is alleged that Mr. Karti received ₹6.38 crore in cash while his wife received ₹1.35 crore in cash during that financial year. The transaction came to light when Income Tax sleuths conducted inquiries with employees of Agni Estates Foundation, a firm which purchased land near Muttukadu, belonging to the Chidambaram family.

A day after the discharge petition was dismissed, on behalf of the couple, their advocate N.R.R. Arun Natarajan issued a statement that cash was not received in the sale transaction.

“The IT department’s complaint was based on a notice of re-assessment. The IT Department's re-assessment proceedings abated on December 31, 2019. No order of assessment or demand was passed. The complaint is non est in law,” Mr. Natarajan said. “We will bring this fact to the notice of the trial court and move Madras High Court against the order,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/karti-wife-to-move-hc-in-tax-evasion-case/article30518053.ece
201,2020/01/09,"Kochi girl found murdered near Valparai, friend held","A 17-year-old girl who went missing from Kochi on Tuesday was found murdered at Varattuparai near Valparai, around 120 km from Coimbatore, in the early hours of Wednesday. A joint team of Tamil Nadu and Kerala police apprehended the girl’s male friend who is from Kumbalam near Kochi.

The police said the body of the deceased, Eva Antony alias Gopika from Kaloor in Kochi, had multiple stab wounds allegedly inflicted by the 26-year-old man, Safar Shah. Preliminary investigation revealed that Shah stabbed the girl after she turned down his marriage proposal. The police said the accused brought the girl to Valparai in a car on Tuesday on the pretext of having a talk with her.

As Eva Antony, a class XII student, did not reach home in the evening, her father lodged a complaint with the Ernakulam Central police. Based on an input that the two were seen travelling in a car that belonged to a car service centre where the accused worked, the Kerala police alerted all the police stations in Ernakulam and nearby districts.

The Malakkapara police of Kerala found that the girl was with the accused in the car when it crossed Malakkapara check-post on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border on Tuesday evening.

But, the girl was not found in the car when the Tamil Nadu police checked the vehicle at Waterfall check-post on Valaparai-Pollachi Road around 8.30 p.m. when Shah was driving towards Pollachi. They found blood stains inside the car and took Shah into custody.

Police said that when questioned, Shah confessed that he stabbed the girl to death and dumped her body in a tea plantation at Varattuparai. The body was traced in a joint search by the Valparai and the Malakkapara police in the early hours of Wednesday.

The Valparai police said that a police team from Ernakulam Central Station took the accused and the body of the deceased to Kochi on Wednesday afternoon.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kochi-girl-found-murdered-near-valparai-friend-held/article30518049.ece
202,2020/01/09,HC reserves verdict on Vedanta’s plea to reopen Sterlite copper plant,"Justices T.S. Sivagnanam and V. Bhavani Subbaroyan of the Madras High Court on Wednesday reserved their verdict on a batch of cases filed by Vedanta Limited to reopen its Thoothukudi Sterlite copper smelting plant. The plant remains shut since April 9, 2018 after Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) refused to grant consent to operate (CTO) the plant due to environmental concerns.

“We shall endeavour to deliver the judgment as early as possible,” the senior judge in the Bench said after the conclusion of marathon arguments advanced by a battery of lawyers for 36 full days since June 20 this year.

Apart from TNPCB, the State government too had on May 28, 2018 ordered for closing down the plant permanently. The Government Order was issued after 13 anti-Sterlite protesters were shot down in a police firing on May 22 that year.

‘Knee-jerk reaction’

Therefore, the primary argument of Vedanta was that the closure was nothing but a knee-jerk reaction to the police firing. It also accused the government as well as the TNPCB of not having produced any acceptable material to prove the charge of damage caused by the plant to the environment.

The government countered the arguments by stating that CTO was denied much before the firing and that the plant was indeed an environmental hazard.

After the incident of police firing, the matter was agitated before the Supreme Court for a few months until the latter on February 19, 2019 directed Vedanta to approach the Madras High Court.

“If such petition is filed before the High Court, it will be open for Vedanta to apply for interim relief considering that their plant has been shut down since April 9, 2018. Also since their plant has been so shut down for a long period, and they are exporting a product which is an important import substitute, the respondent may apply to the Chief Justice of the High Court for expeditious hearing of the writ petition,” the apex court said.

Accordingly, the company filed multiple writ petitions in the High Court on February 22, 2019 challenging different executive orders passed against it and all those petitions were admitted by a Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and M. Nirmal Kumar on March 1, 2019. However, that Bench did not grant any interim relief permitting Vedanta to maintain the plant until the final disposal of the cases filed by it.

After the deputation of Justice Sathyanarayanan to the Madurai Bench of the High Court in June 2019, the then Chief Justice Vijaya Kamlesh Tahilramani ordered listing of the case before a Bench led by Justice Sivagnanam.

Accordingly, the latter began hearing the case along with Justice Subbaroyan on June 20, 2019 and a host of senior counsel including C. Ariyama Sundaram, G. Masilamani, P.S. Raman and AR.L. Sundaresan appeared for Vedanta.

On the other side, the TNPCB was represented by senior counsel C.S. Vaidyanathan and the State government by senior counsel K.V. Viswanathan and Advocate General Vijay Narayan. Senior counsel R. Vaigai, Mr. Vaiko and advocates N.G.R. Prasad, T. Mohan, Balan Haridoss, A. Yogeshwaran also argued on behalf of the interveners opposing the plant. After 28 days of hearing with intermittent adjournments, Justice Sivagnanam suddenly got deputed to Madurai Bench from September 3.

Hence, the lawyers made a representation to the then Chief Justice Tahilramani to permit Justice Sivagnanam to remain in the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai for a week so that the arguments could be completed. However, she ordered that the case be listed before Justice Sivagnanam and Justice R. Tharani in Madurai which was not acceptable to the lawyers since they would have to argue the entire case afresh due to the introduction of a new judge in the Bench.

In the meantime, Chief Justice Tahilramani resigned and Acting Chief Justice Vineet Kothari permitted the hearing to continue before the Bench comprising Justice Sivagnanam and Justice Subbaroyan. Yet, the case could not be taken up for hearing until Justice Sivagnanam returned to Chennai last month after completing his three month tenure in Madurai since video conferencing was not found to be a viable mode of hearing given the voluminous case bundles that had to be referred to.

After Justice Sivagnanam returned from Madurai last month, Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi waved the green signal for the recommencement of the hearing from December 16. Accordingly, the matter was heard for eight more days before the judgment got reserved on Wednesday.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-reserves-verdict-on-vedantas-plea-to-reopen-sterlite-copper-plant/article30518041.ece
203,2020/01/09,HC puts on hold widening of NH from Villupuram to Nagapattinam,"The Madras High Court on Wednesday directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to put on hold the widening of the 179.55 km NH 45A, between Villupuram and Nagapattinam, until an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was carried out for the entire project, to be implemented at a cost of ₹6,431.71 crore, and also until the Coastal Regulatory Zone clearance was obtained for two stretches in between.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and N. Seshasayee passed the order while disposing of a batch of cases filed against the project being implemented under the Bharatmala Pariyojana programme without carrying out environmental impact assessment. They, however, said that the land acquisition proceedings for the project could go on and that status quo should be maintained only until environmental concerns were addressed.

After completing EIA and obtaining CRZ clearance, the project could proceed after making necessary modifications to address the contra indicators, if any, pointed out by the authorities concerned, the judges said. As and when the project resumes, the concessionaire concerned should identify places where 10 saplings would be planted for every tree cut for the project and the court shall also constitute a team to monitor it, they added.

Authoring the verdict, Justice Seshasayee said, the court has had bitter experiences in the past when several thousand trees were felled about two decades back to convert many National Highways passing through the State into two four lanes. Promises were made and undertakings were given to plant 10 saplings for every tree cut, but “those promises and undertakings were flouted with impunity and forgotten with convenience,” the judge lamented.

Therefore, now it wanted compliance of the rule in letter and spirit in so far as widening of NH 45A was concerned.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-puts-on-hold-widening-of-nh-from-villupuram-to-nagapattinam/article30518040.ece
204,2020/01/09,"We have always opposed NEET in State, says Minister","The AIADMK government maintained in the Assembly on Wednesday that it was still strong in its stand against implementing the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical admissions in Tamil Nadu.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said the State government continued its stand against NEET in the State and was taking “multi-dimensional efforts” against the entrance test that include political pressure as well as legal option.

Dr. Vijayabaskar was replying to DMK president and Leader of the Opposition M.K. Stalin, who raised the issue in the House during zero hour and questioned the State government on the status of the case by it in the Supreme Court last week.

The DMK leader sought to know from the government whether it was planning to take steps for another resolution against NEET since the earlier resolution passed by the Assembly was withheld by the President. Mr. Stalin said the action of the AIADMK government was the “biggest betrayal to social justice and students from rural areas.”

‘Opportunity lost’

The Health Minister took a dig at the DMK for having “sowed seeds of betrayal” as early as December 2010 when the idea of NEET came about during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA), in which the DMK was an ally.

He said the State government was committed to fight against NEET and hence it had moved the Supreme Court seeking to challenge a provision governing the Indian Medical Council Act.

When Mr. Stalin said it was his party which moved the court against NEET and got a stay, Dr. Vijayabaskar said the then Medical Council of India under the UPA regime moved a review plea in the case despite the then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa urging against it.

DMK’s Deputy Leader Duraimurugan intervened to say that the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was “stubborn” in her stand against NEET but since her death, the ruling party could not prevent holding of the entrance test in the State.

A defensive Dr. Vijayabaskar listed the efforts taken by the AIADMK government against NEET through the years and said the DMK lost the opportunity to stop the entrance test while it had a chance and was now questioning the AIADMK.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/79z1e4/article30518038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THVIJAYABASKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/we-have-always-opposed-neet-in-state-says-minister/article30518039.ece
205,2020/01/09,HC refuses to interfere with remand extension of suspected fundamentalists deported from Dubai,"The Madras High Court on Wednesday refused to reverse an order passed by a special court for National Investigating Agency (NIA) cases on October 10 extending the remand period of four suspected fundamentalists, deported from Dubai last year, from 90 to 180 days.

Justices R. Subbiah and R. Pongiappan dismissed criminal appeals filed by Rafi Ahmed, Munthasir, Mohideen Seeni Shahul Hameed and Faizul Sharief who were among many others detained by the Dubai police in January for suspected links with terrorist organisations al-Qaeda and ISIS.

They were in detention in Dubai for nearly six months and then deported to India in July when the NIA arrested them. Initial probe revealed that they had floated an organisation called Ansarulla and conducted meetings in UAE to establish Islamic rule in India through violent means called Jihad.

Since the NIA had failed to complete the investigation against them within 90 days, one of the four petitioners filed a bail application before the special court. Immediately, the investigating sleuths preferred an application for extension of remand and the court too granted the request.

Aggrieved over such extension, they had approached the High Court alleging that the NIA had not given any convincing reason for seeking such extension and that the special court too had failed to apply its mind before granting such extension.

Rejecting such contention, the judges agreed with NIA Special Public Prosecutor R. Karthikeyan that the remand extension had been sought since the evidence against the petitioners had to be collected from a foreign country which takes considerable amount of time.

The court was also told that the NIA sleuths too had visited Dubai in September to collect the material evidences. Further, the interrogation of the accused had led to seizure of 173 digital devices which had been sent for forensic examination.

Convinced with the reasons, the judges said, “we feel the Special Court is wholly justified in accepting the report of the Special Public Prosecutor to extend the remand period.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-refuses-to-interfere-with-remand-extension-of-suspected-fundamentalists-deported-from-dubai/article30518029.ece
206,2020/01/09,"Cartel of doctors, pharma firms and labs fleecing patients, says High Court","Observing that a cartel of doctors, pharmaceutical companies and diagnostic laboratories was fleecing patients, the Madras High Court on Wednesday wanted to know when a separate union ministry for pharma would be created and when a Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices would be brought into force to control unethical marketing practices.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan raised the questions in an interim order passed by them on an income-tax appeal preferred by a private pharmaceutical company which had spent ₹42.81 lakh in 2012-13 towards sales promotion expenses, which included payments made to doctors for promoting the company’s medicines, and claimed tax exemption.

Authoring the order, the senior judge in the Bench said that around 50 million patients avail themselves of treatment from one million doctors in the country every day. The Indian pharmaceutical sector supplies over 50% of global demand for various vaccines, 40% of generic demand in the US and 25% of all medicines in the UK. Valued at $33 million in 2017, it had recorded a substantial rise in turnover from ₹1.16 lakh crore in 2017 to ₹1.29 lakh crore in 2018, the Division Bench said.

“It is being said that medical mafia is controlling the pharmaceutical field and they are responsible for overpricing of the drugs. For the purpose of promoting their drugs in the market, it is being said, the companies are giving incentives such as providing hospitality and foreign trips to doctors who prescribe their medicines.

“A study conducted by Support for Advocacy and Training to Health Intiatives (SATHI), a NGO, states that big pharmaceutical companies bribe doctors through high value bribes such as smart phones, credit cards, e-vouchers and even female companionship... Thus, patients are compelled to pay more unnecessarily because of overpricing of drugs,” the judges said.

Though such overpricing was prohibited under Section 3 of the Drug (Price Control) Order of 1995 and there was also a body titled National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) to keep a check on such illegal activities, “the mechanism is stated to be powerless to take action,” the Bench added.

Further, the Medical Council of India (MCI) had taken note of doctors being bribed by pharmaceutical companies in 2009 and amended the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations of 2002. The amendment prescribed punishments ranging from a fine of ₹5,000 to suspension of medical practice for more than one year.

“Inspite of the above regulations, companies and doctors are indulging in malpractices. Therefore, there should be an integrated approach to bring down malpractices by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, NPPA, MCI and the Income Tax department by taking appropriate proceedings,” the court said.

It directed Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan to submit by January 20 the details of action taken by MCI, NPPA and other authorities against erring doctors as well as pharmaceutical companies in the last five years.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cartel-of-doctors-pharma-firms-and-labs-fleecing-patients-says-high-court/article30518025.ece
207,2020/01/09,Government introduces three Bills,"The AIADMK government introduced three Bills in the Assembly on Wednesday.

While one sought to empower the government to take action against president or vice-president of registered cooperative societies, another sought to provide more powers to government in appointing the Vice-Chancellor to Tamil Nadu Dr. J. Jayalalithaa Fisheries University.

While Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju was introducing the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the House, DMK MLA K. Pitchandi (Kilpennathur) opposed it. At present, the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies Act, 1983, has no provision to place the president or vice-president of a registered cooperative society under suspension in the event of misappropriation of funds or breach of trust or gross mismanagement of the affairs of the society.

Soon after Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar introduced the Tamil Nadu Fisheries University (Amendment) Bill, 2020 in the House, DMK legislator U. Mathivanan (Kilvelur) opposed it. The Bill seeks to provide powers to the State government to monitor the usage of government funds by the university and with power of inspection and inquiry.

It has been decided to include a government nominee in the panel for selection of persons for appointment as Vice-Chancellor.

While Agriculture Minister R. Doraikkannu was introducing the Tamil Nadu Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2020, DMK member S. Austin (Kanniyakumari) opposed it. The proposed legislation sought to replace the Ordinance to extend the tenure of the special officers appointed to manage the affairs of the market committee pending the constitution of a new market committee by another six months beyond November 2019.

208,2020/01/09,BoB official accused of duping the bank,"An official of the Bank of Baroda allegedly colluded with a couple of timber merchants and hoodwinked the credit management system to cheat the nationalised bank of ₹8.16 crore in Tenkasi district.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case based on a specific complaint lodged by the bank authorities that Forex Officer A. Vivekanandan of Rajapalayam Branch favoured Sri Vani Trading Company represented by its partners T. Marimuthu and E. Inbaraj of Tenkasi by enabling them avail credit over and above the sanctioned limit.

The accused official also obtained Letter of Credit bills without payment thereby causing loss to the bank.

The allegation is that the firm, engaged in processing and sale of timber products, got a credit facility of ₹1.5 crore in 2011 which was gradually increased to ₹5.5 crore in 2017.

The primary security was hypothecation of stock and book debts which amounted to ₹4.5 crore as per the statement submitted by the borrower.

The value of the collateral security was fixed at ₹2.68 crore.

The bank follows a system where Letters of Credit are transmitted to the Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS) and corresponding entries are made in the core banking software called Finnacle.

During an audit inspection in 2018, it came to light that inland Letters of Credit were sent through SFMS on behalf of Sri Vani Trading Company but no corresponding entry was made in the Finnacle system.

The bank’s internal investigation further revealed that the beneficiary in the Letters of Credit was another timber trading firm owned by one of the partners of Sri Vani Trading Company.

Entries into system of accounting were deliberately delayed to facilitate the beneficiary firm to avail the credit in excess of the sanctioned limit.

Mr. Vivekanandan had facilitated this offence with a fraudulent intention to cheat the bank, CBI’s First Information Report said.

Stock removed

When bank officials inspected the timber factory, the stocks that were hypothecated were clandestinely removed.

The CBI’s Anti-Corruption Branch booked the accused bank official and others on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, and also invoked the provisions under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, against them.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bob-official-accused-of-duping-the-bank/article30517948.ece

In her meeting with Ms. Ghosh and other students, she enquired about the events that unfolded on Sunday night on the campus.

“The students feel that they were specifically targeted. The people who attacked them knew who to attack, which rooms to attack and who were staying in which place. The Vice Chancellor hasn’t met or reached out or visited any of the injured students,” she told The Hindu.

Ms. Kanimozhi questioned why the police did not act for nearly three hours when violence was unleashed on the campus. “Why didn’t they enter the campus and protect the students?” She accused the police of being silent spectators and sought to know the reasons behind it. She visited one of the hostels that were attacked.

212,2020/01/09,Duraimurugan’s remark irks CM,"An angry Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami lashed out at DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan after a war of words broke out between the two when the latter complained that Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar was taking a lot of time in his interventions and was speaking in the Assembly as if he was speaking at a public meeting.

The face-off between the two leaders took place when DMK president M.K. Stalin brought up the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Act, blaming the AIADMK for supporting the Bill. “It is because of your support to the Bill in Parliament that the whole country is seeing protests, attacks,” Mr. Stalin said.

Mr. Udhayakumar intervened that it was the opposition that was spreading false propaganda and was creating unrest in the country. He warned that “if you want to see that sort of a bloodshed in Tamil Nadu, this government will tackle it with an iron hand”. Mr. Udhayakumar then went on a long explanation on the CAA to which Mr. Duraimurugan objected.

Mr. Duraimurugan said while the Ministers, including the Chief Minister, had the right to intervene and explain issues, Mr. Udhayakumar was consistently taking a lot of time and was speaking like at a public meeting and said the DMK would protest if the Ministers continued like this.

The Chief Minister sprung to his feet to defend the Minister. He said: “Everyone has a right to speak. You don’t have to tell him how to speak. The deputy leader of opposition cannot order that. If you think you can create trouble, we won’t allow it to happen,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

Pointing to Mr. Duraimuruagan, Mr. Palaniswami said: “You are speaking in a threatening manner. This is not done”. The House witnessed a ruckus following this with MLAs from both the sides getting on their feet and shouting at each other.

Mr Shashanka inspected the colourful rangolies painted by the girls and appreciated them. He also visited the dairy farm and inquired about the breeding of animals, fodder etc. Speaking on the occasion, the Collector called upon the farmers to take up dairy units along with farm activities to reap riches besides good health with the consumption of milk and milk products. He also said that rearing of milch animals would also help the farmers to produce organic manure through vermicompost.

He also appreciated the Karimnagar Dairy for taking measures for increasing milk production by distributing milch animals by providing financial assistance. He also lauded the welfare schemes for the dairy farmers and their family members and also cattle. On this occasion, he distributed scholarships to the students of milk producers and prizes to the bulk cooling units for more procurement of milk and also insurance amount to the bereaved families of milk producers.

Dairy chairman Ch Rajeshwara Rao explained about the progress of the Karimnagar dairy since last two decades. Claiming that the dairy had emerged number one dairy in terms of milk procurement and milk sales, he also said that Karimnagar Dairy tops in welfare schemes for the farmers. He also explained about the expansion of the dairy at Nallagonda village with a capacity of 3 lakh litres. Dairy Advisor V Hanumanth Reddy, Managing Director P Shankar Reddy, directors and others were also present.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/jzneco/article30527112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10KARIMDAIRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/collector-lauds-performance-of-karimnagar-dairy/article30527113.ece
215,2020/01/09,300 kg ganja smuggled in toys seized,"With the police intensifying vigil along the Chintoor-Bhadrachalam inter-State highway, hitherto most preferred route by ganja smugglers, the inter-State gangs involved in smuggling of the contraband are finding new tactics to hoodwink law enforcement authorities.

Burgampadu police seized a huge consignment of ganja weighting over 300 kg worth about ₹ 40 lakh concealed in small packets wrapped in bamboo baskets and children’s toys at Sarapaka on Thursday morning.

Three persons including two women from Punjab, suspected to be ganja peddlers, were detained by the police with the contraband for questioning, sources said. A fortnight ago, the Khammam rural police confiscated a large quantity of ganja hidden underneath a load of bags containing chocolates and biscuits from a Meerut-bound container lorry.

216,2020/01/09,Parties to hold public meeting in Khammam against CAA,"A round table organised by the CPI(M) and involving opposition parties and various mass organisations here on Thursday resolved to hold a public meeting in the town on January 24 to spearhead a broad-based mass movement against the BJP-led Central government’s alleged “divisive” policies"" and to defend India's secularism

The round table presided over by CPI(M) district secretary N Nageswara Rao called upon all sections of society to help build a concerted joint movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR), according to a press release.

Speakers at the round table lashed out at the BJP regime at the Centre, accusing it of trying to polarise the country on communal lines by aggressively pushing its ""divisive agenda"" at the behest of fascist forces.

Terming the CAA a “divisive and discriminatory” law, Mr Nageswara Rao alleged that the BJP dispensation was attempting to pursue fascist agenda by bringing the “discriminatory law” for its selfish political gain.

The dictatorial tendencies of the persons at the helm posed a grave threat to the secular foundations of the Constitution, he charged.

Echoing the views, other speakers underlined the need for a sustained joint movement involving the Left, democratic and secular forces against “communal polarisation” and “religious majoritarianism” to save India’s democracy and secularism.

They further alleged that the ""fascist forces"" were threatening the secular fabric of the country.

CPI district secretary B Hemantha Rao, CPI (ML-ND) district secretary G Venkateshwara Rao, and city Congress president Md. Javeed spoke.

The round table passed a unanimous resolution to hold a huge rally followed by a public meeting at Pavilion Grounds in the town on January 24 to carry forward the “anti-CAA, NPR and NRC” movement more vigorously.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bo9va9/article30525042.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10HYKHM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/parties-plan-public-meeting-in-khammam-against-caa/article30525043.ece
217,2020/01/09,Collector’s directive for seamless Sivaratri festivities,"In the wake of the ensuing Sivaratri jatara at Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam in Vemulawada, Collector D. Krishna Bhaskar instructed the officials concerned to make arrangements for a seamless pilgrimage to several thousands of devotees visiting the temple.

The festivities would be held from February 20 to 22, the main festival being on February 21.

The Collector conducted a coordination committee meeting with the police and officials of endowments, RTC, electricity and others at the Vemulawada temple shrine on Thursday.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Krishna Bhaskar instructed the RTC authorities to operate more buses on routes where there is a high demand. He asked them to provide amenities such as RTC temporary bus shelters and “May I Help You” counters to guide commuters.

He directed the officials to accord top priority to sanitation at the shrine and other parts of the temple town. He asked them to make adequate arrangements for the supply of drinking water to pilgrims, especially in queues. He instructed the Devasthanam authorities to erect adequate sign boards to provide necessary information about the darshan and queues.

Superintendent of Police Rahul Hegde said that they would strengthen the security by deploying additional police forces and installation of more CCTV cameras for better surveillance. He also said that they would take measures for the regulation of traffic and allocation of separate parking lots on the outskirts of the temple shrine.

Joint Collector Yasmeen Basha told the authorities to complete the beautification works of the temple shrine at least 10 days before the festival. She also instructed them to educate people about the conduct of cultural programmes during festivities.

218,2020/01/09,Adivasi women master the art of dispensing fuel,"Contrary to some stereotype presumptions, the six Adivasi women who have been employed as service station attendants at the Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC)-run petrol bunks at Kerameri and Tiryani mandal headquarters, have taken to the job like fish to water. Watching them function for a few minutes revealed that they are comfortable dispensing fuel and related tasks like swiping cards.

“We are quite at ease in this job,” Mesram Tukabai, a Raj Gond aboriginal from Chaupanguda in Kerameri mandal asserted, echoing her colleagues’ feeling too. Like her, Mesram Tirumala, a Pardhan tribal from Jhari and Madavi Anjali, an Ojha Adivasi from Keslaguda in the same mandal, working in the Kerameri bunk, find interacting with different kinds of people everyday an easy task.

Not out of place

The rural women do not feel out of place in the job apparently because of their upbringing. It goes to the credit of the ethnic communities that girls are raised in a free and unrestricted atmosphere.

“Yes, the women are doing a good job,” said GCC’s Utnoor divisional manager L.K. Ramanandam. “Our average sales are to the tune of an encouraging ₹2 lakh per day at both the filling stations,” he said.

“In addition to these two, bunks at Jainoor in KB Asifabad and Utnoor in Adilabad district will start soon. The aim of GCC is to provide employment to tribal youth who have passed SSC,” the divisional manager said.

Call for salary hike

Each of the bunks has three male attendants mostly working in the night, and three women working in the day on a salary of ₹ 6,000 per month. “The GCC should increase the salary as this is not sufficient to take care of our families,” Ms. Tirumala who, like her co-workers is married and has children to look after, appealed.

“We will hike the salary once we register increased sales. The corporation should reap benefits before the increase,” assured Mr. Ramanandam.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/p1soqy/article30528050.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-ADILA-PETROL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/adivasi-women-function-like-pro-at-gcc-run-petrol-bunks/article30524519.ece
219,2020/01/09,"IIT-H, Monash university analysis moots geothermal energy","An extensive analysis by the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H) and Monash University, Australia, has led researchers to suggest that geothermal energy (using earth’s heat to generate power) is better than photovoltaic energy, in terms of carbon dioxide emissions.

The researchers also found that a combination of renewable energy technology must be adopted in this era of dwindling fossil fuel reserves and increasing greenhouse gas emissions.

This analysis was undertaken by professor D. Chandrasekharam of the department of Civil Engineering, IIT-H, and professor G. Ranjith Pathegama of the department of Civil Engineering, Monash University, Melbourne.

The research paper was published recently in the journal “Geomechanics and Geophysics for Geo-Energy and Geo-Resources.”

“While solar power does have benefits over conventional energy sources, is the hype surrounding its apparent ‘greenness’ justified? Solar power is far from the zero-emission energy source that it is claimed to be,” said Chandrasekharam.

Their study involved life-cycle assessment of renewable energy sources. Around 10 tonnes of quartz are needed to manufacture solar cells that can generate one megawatt of electricity from the Sun. One MW of electricity can support about 20,000 people annually.

“Imagine how many tonnes of quartz has to be mined to support millions of people in the countries! A Solar pv cell involves two important stages: i) producing metallurgical grade silicon (MGS) and ii) producing electronic grade silicon (EGS) from quartz. In the first stage, 1,756 thousand tonnes of CO2 are released, and a similar amount of CO2 is released during the conversion of EGS to ingots,” he added.

The total CO2 emissions during the life-cycle of a solar pv cell are about 3,312 million kg. This is far higher than geothermal energy source, which emits about 450 g/kWh generated, reports the paper.

According to the recently-published report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), under the sustainable development policy proposed for adoption to mitigate CO2 emissions (year 2040), nearly 54 billion cells are required to meet the generation target of 14,139 TWh. This amounts to releasing huge amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere instead of conserving CO2, the researchers say.

“Unlike other renewables, geothermal energy can supply base-load electricity and the waste after its life-cycle, unlike solar PV, is negligible. The best way to go forward is to choose a combination of technologies that can minimise harm to the environment, not chase the horizon of zero harm,” write the researchers.

The researchers analysed the life-cycle assessment solar cell technology in terms of the environmental impacts during construction, operation and decommissioning stages.

In addition to CO2 emissions associated with mining of silica and its conversion into electronic-grade quartz to be used in solar cells, disposal of waste is a huge environmental concern, they say.

According to the “End of life management of solar photo voltaic panels” published by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), globally 60 to 75 million tonnes of solar pv panel waste will be generated by 2050 that cannot be recycled. Some facts are hard to digest, say the researchers.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/xyr6au/article30527887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-IITH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/iit-h-monash-university-analysis-moots-geothermal-energy/article30524444.ece
220,2020/01/09,Employees boycott work against privatisation of power sector,"The engineers, employees and artisans, except those in shift duties, working for all power utilities in Telangana have boycotted work and staged mass demonstrations across the State on Wednesday, protesting against the privatisation policies of the Central government.

All the 22 unions and associations of Telangana power utilities’ employees have supported and participated in the protest call given by the National Coordination Committee of Electricity Employees and Engineers (NCCOEEE). The work boycott and demonstrations were held at all offices of the power utilities, including all the thermal and hydel power stations.

G. Saibabu, E. Sridhar, P. Ratnakar Rao, P. Sadanandam, B.C. Reddy, M.A. Vazeer, E. Srinivas and several others of various unions and associations said they had boycotted work in response to a call given by NCCOEEE, a united platform of unions and federations of electricity employees and engineers. The power sector employees are fighting against the Central government’s move to pass the Electricity (Amendment) Bill as well as bringing in other privatisation policies which, they alleged, are against the interests of power utilities, consumers and employees.

They stated that most of the amendments proposed in the Electricity Act 2003 and National Tariff Policy are against the interests of consumers with the worst part being introduction of supply licenses, under which private players would only meter and supply power to the consumer from the nearby pole or transformer. The distribution companies (Discoms) would maintain the power distribution network and the private companies would make heavy profits without any investment from high-end consumers and the supply obligation of subsidised power would be left with the Discoms.

The proposed amendments would phase out subsidy and cross-subsidy in power distribution in a period of three years and it would become costly to the consumers. Further, the amendments would also eat into the role of regulatory commissions as they would be forced only to follow the NTP. Other main demands of power employees include integration of all power utilities in States, review of power purchase agreements in the interests of people, revival of old pension scheme to all electricity employees, equal wage for equal work, among others.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/1v3kuf/article30517405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy09powerstaff,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/employees-boycott-work-against-privatisation-of-power-sector/article30517406.ece
221,2020/01/09,Doubles pair brings joy to the locals,"A dynamic Nick Kyrgios and dogged Alex de Minaur powered Australia into the ATP Cup semifinals on Thursday with an epic 2-1 win against Tim Henman-led Britain, and the host was joined by Russia which overpowered Argentina 3-0.

The home team clinched the tie after an 18-16 third-set tiebreaker in the doubles to set up a potential blockbuster last-four clash against Rafael Nadal’s Spain, which faces Belgium on Friday.

Russia, spearheaded by Daniil Medvedev, won both its singles to sweep past Argentina. The reward is a semifinal against either Novak Djokovic’s Serbia, or Canada.

Kyrgios crushed Cameron Norrie in the opening singles 6-2, 6-2 before Dan Evans came through a memorable showdown against De Minaur 7-6(4), 4-6, 7-6(2) to set up the decisive, winner-takes-all doubles.

Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt took a huge gamble by dropping regular doubles pair John Peers and Chris Guccione in favour of Kyrgios and de Minaur, and it looked a poor decision when they lost the first set 6-3. But, spurred by Kyrgios’ booming serve, they took the next 6-3 before a nailbiting tie-breaker.

The results: Australia bt Britain 2-1 [Nick Kyrgios bt Cameron Norrie 6-2, 6-2; Alex de Minaur lost to Dan Evans 7-6(4), 4-6, 7-6(2); Kyrgios & de Minaur bt Jamie Murray & Joe Salisbury 3-6, 6-3, 18-16].

222,2020/01/09,Easy for Bengaluru FC,"Bengaluru FC climbed to the second spot on the ISL table with a dominant 2-0 victory over Jamshedpur FC here on Thursday.

The loss was Jamshedpur’s third in succession, with the side winless in its last six games.

BFC took an early lead, the goal scored from what is now a familiar set-piece routine. A corner was won after a sustained spell of pressure, and Dimas Delgado delivered a fine ball for Erik Paartalu at the near post. The Australian rose high to head home in the eighth minute.

BFC’s second in the 63rd minute was a product of two excellent pieces of action at opposite ends of the pitch.

First, with Gourav Mukhi racing towards the BFC goal, Juanan put in a perfectly-timed sliding tackle. With possession recovered, Paartalu clipped a long, aerial pass for Sunil Chhetri. Left-back Narender Gahlot was caught ball-watching as Chhetri slipped past him before scoring from an acute angle.

224,2020/01/09,Goncalves continues to press forward,"Hero MotoSports Team Rally’s Paulo Goncalves appeared supremely confident at the start of the Stage 5 of the Dakar Rally here on Thursday, under tough conditions including temperatures ranging around two degree Celsius in the morning.

The 36-year-old from Portugal justified his confidence as he went on to record a fine show to finish 10th. His mates, Sebastian Buhler and C.S. Santosh, did equally well to complete the race in 21st and 37th respectively.

Hero consolidates

In fact, Hero consolidated its showing from the previous stage to keep it steady before the rally halts in Riyadh on January 11 for a rest day.

Stage 5 was a special phase covering 353km from Al Ula to Ha’il and tested the competitors.

Goncalves continued to press forward today as well and delivered a back-to-back top-10 finish for the team with the 10th spot. Goncalves climbed several positions for the second day in-a-row to finish 59th overall.

Buhler maintained his top-20 position to reach 19th and Santosh rose a few ranks to break into the top-40 at 39th place in the overall rankings. With just one more stage to go and the complexion changing from being technical to wide-open desert, Friday is expected to see more competitors trying to push hard in tackling the longest stage with 830km to be done.

Calmness helped

Goncalves said his calmness helped him do well. “Today there was change in the scenery from the trials and stony tracks of the last 3-4 days to the more open desert. In the first part of the stage, I tried to push hard and rode well. After the refuelling, there was 200km of open off-piste stage that could be fast but dangerous as well. So I decided to slow my pace a bit to avoid crashes.”

Buhler said his only focus to avoid mistakes: “It was a hard stage and we had almost 200km in the off-piste towards the end. I tried not to go too fast to avoid making any mistakes.”

Santosh sounded upbeat. “What an amazing last two days it has been... tough but incredible. I really enjoyed riding the stage and am feeling more confident.”

The placings (provisional): Stage 5: 10. Paulo Goncalves; 21. Sebastian Buhler; 37. C.S. Santosh. Overall: 18. Buhler; 39. Santosh; 59. Goncalves.

225,2020/01/09,Kuldeep — putting to rest the ghosts of 2019,"At the start of 2019, Kuldeep Yadav was on cloud nine. Having picked up a five-for in the Sydney Test, the chinaman bowler was billed as India’s premier spinner by head coach Ravi Shastri. By the end of the year, however, Kuldeep was struggling to keep his place in the team in all three formats.

Back on track

Not just the National team, Kuldeep was even dropped by Kolkata Knight Riders during the Indian Premier League.

However, the bowler seemed to have got his mojo back in his first outing in the new decade, with a strong show against Sri Lanka in Indore on Tuesday.

Speaking on the year that was, here on Thursday, Kuldeep said: “It was a tough one. But, I learned a lot of things and the biggest positive was getting to know that I could have planned things better. If I had given it more thought and given more time to myself, I could have performed better.

“In 2020, I will try to plan every game better and give myself more time, more time to reflect on my game. You play a lot of matches, but at the same time you have to give yourself more time to plan for the next game. I want to be more mentally prepared this year.”

In his endeavour to prepare better for the year ahead culminating in the T20 World Cup and the following Test series in Australia, Kuldeep said he had been “eating the brains” of the performance analyst and coaching staff.

Support staff’s help

“I will definitely take the help of video analysts and speak to the bowling coach in the nets. We need to work on figuring out the opposition batsmen’s strengths and weaknesses,” he said.

Since everyone was aware that he was a chinaman bowler, who has wrong-uns and flippers, he needed to bring changes to his bowling and catch the batsmen by surprise, he said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/f9j4tf/article30526344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10KUL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/kuldeep-putting-to-rest-the-ghosts-of-2019/article30526345.ece
226,2020/01/09,Yet another home series victory beckons India,"Besides Jasprit Bumrah’s return to competitive cricket after four months, the most significant aspect of the three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka is the face-off between K.L. Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan for the second opener’s position.

Stage set for duel

With Rohit Sharma rested, Rahul and Dhawan have been presented an opportunity to make their case, against a mediocre bowling unit. After the first match was washed out in Guwahati, Rahul had a better outing in Tuesday’s second T20 in Indore.

Come Friday, stylish left-hander Dhawan will be keen to have his say in helping India win yet another home series at the Maharashtra Cricket Association stadium here.

While Rahul preferred to rest instead of joining teammates for an optional training session, Dhawan, who looked a bit rusty in his first appearance for India in two months, made optimum use of Thursday’s training.

Rishabh Pant, meanwhile, was busy tonking the ball onto the adjoining Mumbai-Pune Expressway. Dhawan, on the other hand, put his head down and worked on getting his timing right.

His was perhaps the longest stint in India’s two-and-a-half-hour session.

With the countdown to the T20 World Cup in October having switched into the next gear at the turn of the decade, it will be interesting to see if Dhawan can seize the opportunity on a belter of a track and add to the selectors’ headache.

The absence of left-arm pacer Isuru Udana, who hurt his back in the field in Indore, will leave the Sri Lankan bowling attack as a one-man unit, with captain Lasith Malinga barely having any credible support.

Udana’s injury will most likely result in Angelo Mathews’ T20 comeback after well over 16 months.

Captain Malinga and newly-appointed coach Mickey Arthur will be hoping that Mathews gives the team the fillip it needs, especially in the batting department.

The Sri Lankan batters, barring Kusal Perera, looked at sea against the Indian attack in Indore.

They appeared listless, be it against the raw pace and variations of the triumvirate of Bumrah, Navdeep Saini and Shardul Thakur or against the quality spin of Kuldeep Yadav and Washington Sundar.

Pleasant memories

With an injury-plagued bowling attack, Sri Lanka cannot even think of re-living the feat of 2016, when it bowled India out for 101 at the same venue. If it has to be competitive on Friday, Mathews and Perera will have to lead a batting revival.

The teams (from):

India: Virat Kohli (Capt.), Shikhar Dhawan, K.L. Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Navdeep Saini, Shardul Thakur, Manish Pandey, Washington Sundar and Sanju Samson.

Sri Lanka: Lasith Malinga (Capt.), Danushka Gunathilaka, Avishka Fernando, Angelo Mathews, Dasun Shanaka, Kusal Perera, Niroshan Dickwella, Dhananjaya de Silva, Isuru Udana, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, Oshada Fernando, Wanindu Hasaranga, Lahiru Kumara, Kusal Mendis, Lakshan Sandakan and Kasun Rajitha.

227,2020/01/09,Mandeep eyes winning start to season,"Set to make their debut in the FIH Pro League against the Netherlands at home, India striker Mandeep Singh on Thursday said his team would look to make a winning start to the season with the two-match contest later this month.

After having skipped the inaugural edition of the Pro League last year, India will take on the Netherlands in their first leg of event in Bhubaneswar on January 18 and 19.

Tough fight likely

And the young striker believes the World No. 5 host will give the Dutch side, ranked third, a tough fight in the upcoming contests.

“We have always played close matches against the Netherlands and although we have not played them over the past year, we believe we have improved as a team with good structure and scoring capabilities,” said Mandeep, who scored maximum goals for India last year.

“Also we are playing at home, so we would definitely not want to let our fans down. We want to make a winning start to the season,” he added.

Mandeep feels the share of his success should also go to his teammates, without whose help it wouldn’t have been possible for him to shine on the turf.

“If I am scoring goals, then it is because of the assists I am getting from my team mates.

“My understanding with seniors S.V. Sunil, Ramandeep (Singh) and Akashdeep (Singh) is much better as we have spent more time together.

“We discuss and debate a lot off the field and to try analyse how we played and where we could have created gap and how we need to work inside the circle. This has really helped me a lot to improve as a striker.”

Mandeep said with back-to-back matches against the Netherlands scheduled, the team management’s primary focus during the national coaching camp that started here on December 29 was on fitness and recovery.

“Since we will be playing back-to-back high intensity matches in the FIH Hockey Pro league with little less than 24 hours of recovery time between matches, the training sessions are planned in such a way that we have red sessions (high intensity training) on back-to-back days and then rest or train light the next session,” he said.

“Robin Arkel (Scientific Advisor) planned extremely tough gym sessions in the previous camp.

“Even though we are a fit team, the focus was to build on our strength much more,” Mandeep said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/u4aa30/article30526062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10MANDEEP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/mandeep-eyes-winning-start-to-season/article30526063.ece
228,2020/01/09,Sturdy beds for hard battlers,"Tokyo Olympic athletes beware — particularly larger ones. The bed frames in the Athletes Village at this year’s Olympics will be made of cardboard. Sturdy cardboard.

“Those beds can stand up to 200kg,” explained Takashi Kitajima, the general manager of the Athletes Village, speaking through an interpreter. Surely no Olympic athlete weighs that much.

Stronger than wood

“They are stronger than wooden beds,” Kitajima added. He also took into account the possibility of a wild room celebration after, say, a gold-medal victory. “Of course, wood and cardboard would each break if you jumped on them,” he said.

The single-bed frames will be recycled into paper products after the Games. The mattress components — the mattresses are not made of cardboard — will be recycled into plastic products.

The mattress is broken up into three distinct sections, and the firmness of each can be adjusted. The idea was to use materials that could be remade after the Olympics and Paralympics. But the cardboard frames and supports should give the rooms a spartan look.

Organisers showed off the beds and a few other furnishings on Thursday at their headquarters. The entire Athletes Village complex will be completed in June. The Olympics opens on July 24 followed by the Paralympics on August 25.

“The organising committee was thinking about recyclable items, and the bed was one of the ideas,” Kitajima explained, crediting local Olympic sponsor Airweave Inc. for the execution.

Organisers say this is the first time that beds and bedding in the Athletes Village have been made of renewable materials.

229,2020/01/09,"Dhoni may end his ODI career soon, says Shastri","Two-time World Cup winning India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni may “soon end his ODI career”, head coach Ravi Shastri has revealed.

Speaking on other issues, Shastri also slammed the ICC’s four-day Test proposal, calling the concept “nonsense“.

“I have had a conversation with MS and that is between us. He has finished his Test career, he may soon end his ODI career... In all probability, he will finish one-day cricket,” said Shastri.

“People must respect that he’s played non-stop in all formats of the game for a while.”

“At his age, probably the only format he’ll want to play is T20 cricket which means he’ll have to start playing again, get back into the groove because he’s going to play in the IPL and see how his body reacts.”

The coach reiterated that the 38-year-old veteran could still be a contender for the T20 World Cup if he does well in the upcoming Indian Premier League.

”... So he will be left with T20, he will definitely play the IPL. One thing I know about Dhoni is that he will not impose himself on the team. But if he has a cracking IPL, well, then...”

Dhoni’s last outing in India colours was during the World Cup semifinal against New Zealand in July where he was run out following a half century.

Shastri said form and experience will be taken into consideration while picking the team for the shortest format’s biggest event.

“We will have to consider the person’s experience and form. They will bat in the number 5-6 position. If Dhoni plays well in the IPL then he does put himself in contention.”

Dhoni, who is on a sabbatical right now, has turned up for the country in 350 ODIs, 90 Tests and 98 T20 Internationals while effecting a staggering 829 dismissals behind the stumps.

His career is studded with several milestones including leading India to the trophy in the 2011 World Cup where he finished the title clash with a six.

As the discussion turned to four-day Tests, Shastri, like some of the greats of the game such as Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting, opposed the idea.

“Four day Test is nonsense,” he said.

“If this goes on we may have limited-overs Tests. There is no need to tamper with five-day Tests. If at all they want to tamper then let the top six sides play five-day Tests and the next six be allowed to play four-day Tests.

“If you want to preserve Tests then let the top six play more against each other. You have the shorter format to popularise the game.”

When asked about day-night Tests, Shastri called on ICC to get the ball right.

“Day-night Test is still under test. I still feel that pink ball does not give any advantage to spinners, they need to get the ball right for day night. During the day you have full Tests, by night it looks like half Test.

“I still feel that you will get more people to watch Tests if you have the top six play each other (more often).”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/nt0g6g/article30524135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKET-INDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/dhoni-may-end-his-odi-career-soon-says-shastri/article30524137.ece
230,2020/01/09,Correcting the errors,"Maulana Abul Kalam Azad’s book “India Wins Freedom” is one of the most widely read books on the events and happenings leading to the partition of India. In response to this book Rajmohan Gandhi wrote “India Wins Errors: A Scrutiny of Maulana Azad’s India Wins Freedom”(2006) which, as its self -explanatory title suggests, tried to point to some inaccuracies and errors in the Maulana’s book.

Shafey Kidwai, the winner of 2019 Sahitya Akademi Award in Urdu for his book “Sawaneh-e- Sir Syed: Ek Baazdeed”, a biographical account of Sir Syed (1817-1898) which covers some, though not all, important aspects of his life (Brown Publications, 2017), performs a similar task when he subjects another iconic book, Altaf Hussain Hali’s (1837-1914) biography of Sir Syed “Hayat-e-Javed” (1901) to a thorough scrutiny.

Source text

“Hayat-e-Javed” has generally been used as a basic source text for scores of books, both in Urdu and English, on Sir Syed. It is only appropriate that Kidwai’s book gets important notice in the bicentenary year of Sir Syed’s birth when not only the vast literature available on him is being looked at afresh but also a number of programmes on the great thinker and educationist are underway in different parts of the world, thanks to the vast network of AMU alumni.

A very respected name in Urdu literary criticism and journalism, Shafey Kidwai, interestingly, has never studied Urdu formally. The grandson of celebrated Islamic scholar Abdul Majid Daryabadi (1892-1977) has been a student of social sciences and has mostly mastered the intricacies of Urdu language at home in a literary environment. He brings the rigours of social sciences to his investigation of various facts in Hali’s book, cross checking and correcting them. A believer in C.P. Snow’s dictum ‘comment is free, but facts are sacred’, one of the methods used in his study is the critical cross checking of some opinions and facts about Sir Syed’s life in the works of his other biographers, in particular, G.F.I. Graham’s “The Life and Works of Sir Saiyyed” (1885) and Iftikhar Alam Khan’s “Sir Syed: Duroone Khana” (2006).

For him the primary source is the writings of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, especially Sir Syed’s biography of his maternal grandfather “Sirat-e- Faridiya”, “Life of Mohammed”, his letters and the periodical “Risala Khair Khwahan” which Sir Syed started. Thus, Kidwai discovers that Sir Syed’s father’s and his sister’s names are not mentioned correctly by Hali and Graham. His father’s name was neither Mir Mohammad Muttaqi, nor Syed Mohammad Taqi, but Syed Mohammad Muttaqi whereas his sister’s name, as written by Sir Syed, was Ijbitun Nisan and not Safiatun Nisan as recorded by Hali. He also puts on record the fact that Sir Syed’s ancestors came to India during the period of Akbar, and not Shahjahan as recorded by Hali.

Excellent command

Kidwai also disagrees with Hali’s view that Sir Syed read only half-seriously the elementary books of Arabic and Persian. Syed’s writings, Kidwai argues, prove his serious reading and excellent command of the two languages. Similarly, three different dates have been given of the beginning of Sir Syed’s employment by Hali, Graham, and Alam. Kidwai casts his dice in favour of Alam who considers 1838 as the year when Syed started his official career.

Sir Syed is usually discussed as a reformer and educationist by all commentators. Kidwai throws important light on his role as the member of Viceroy’s Legislative Council. Sir Syed was deeply concerned that a lot of children died of small pox and ironically this was accepted as the curse of God. A rationalist to the core, he prepared and introduced the draft of the bill to eradicate small pox. In his second term as the member of the Council, he threw his weight behind the proposal of raising the age of civil services aspirants for Indians and conducting the examination in India as well as in England.

Of Sir Syed’s two sons, a lot has been written about his younger son Syed Mahmood (1850-1903) who was the first Indian jurist to be appointed to Allahabad High Court. Kidwai importantly dwells on the redeeming qualities of his other son Syed Hamid who was given to drinking and who had to quit his job. Kidwai also presents some interesting anecdotes from Sir Syed’s life to bring out his sense of humour, his truthfulness, and his affable nature.

Baffled by Hali’s errors, Kidwai looks at the sources of Hali’s book and discovers that Hali relied a great deal on one unpublished biography of Sir Syed written by Munshi Sirajuddin. Sirajuddin’s text, considered too hagiographic and also lacking proper style, was not approved by Sir Syed and was later handed over to Hali when he found time to write “Hayat-e-Javed”. Kidwai is scathing in his criticism of Hali’s inaccuracies which he considers unpardonable because Hali could access both Sirajuddin’s draft as well as Graham’s which had come out by then.

At the end Sir Syed’s own words on the genre of biography reveal his modesty and his care for an honest scholarship: “Biography is not hagiography. It should be such that it should be a specimen of the good and bad aspects of the subject….Writing about me that ‘ he is very learned and perfect’, how wrong is this.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ifivhu/article30524739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20200107144543,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/correcting-the-errors/article30524721.ece
231,2020/01/09,Akbar Padamsee: The Sanskrit scholar among the Progressives,"Akbar Padamsee’s passing away invited an elegiac silence in the contemporary art world. India has lost the Sanskrit scholar among the Progressives. Padamsee, as an artist, led us into a space of refined aesthetic, balancing between the hieratic and the human.

In the best of two centuries, Padamsee nourished himself as the fountainhead of regional and ancestral traditions to translate an epoch of modernism in his sensibility and language. Born in Mumbai on April 12, 1928, into a Khoja Muslim family with intellectual leanings, Padamsee joined Sir. J.J. School of Art in 1948, with considerable support from his family and the blessings of Aga Khan.

Sanskrit scholar

Padamsee drew from Kalidasa’s “Abhijnanasakuntalam” extensively. The principle “Ye dve kaal vigattah (These two controllers of time)” indicate the simultaneous presence of the sun and the moon. In the same way, each aspect of his paintings was elemental: “Sarva bija prakruti (That which is responsible for the growth of all seeds). This duality, at once spiritual and aesthetic, and the core of much of Indian and Chinese philosophy, defined Padamsee’s art.

Post Partition, it was Sayed Haider Raza’s moving to Paris that prompted Padamsee to move to the French city to study and peruse painting. Raza, Souza, and Padamsee became the trio who whose canvas was fermented by French avant-garde sensibilities.

His first show was held with Raza and Souza at Gallerie Saint Placide in 1952 and a two-person show with Raza, Indian Painters in Paris, in 1953. His first solo in India was held at the Jehangir Art Gallery in 1954. By then, there were influences of Picasso, Braque, and Modigliani that had formed their own impressions on his palette.

‘Grey Period’

The Jehangir solo saw him execute four paintings. They belonged to his ‘grey period’. Greek Landscape, Reclining Nude, Juhu and Cityscape were arguably among the finest of Padamsee's oeuvre. His figurative works and cityscapes were preludes to the panoramic paintings – they had no linear narrative nor definite beginning and end, dense landscapes were almost entirely filled by block-like architectural forms, abutting each other on what looked like a gentle hillside.

Another salient solo was his 1960 solo exhibition, in which he decided he would not paint indoors, but out in the open and only at night. Spreading a huge canvas on the floor of the lighted court, he would start to work, confining himself to the use of two colours: black and white.

Reflecting on this change, Padamsee said, “Painting in my Juhu flat I started working on it for three or four nights because the sunlight was too much in my open courtyard, I had to work at night. And a dog used to come and sit next to me. He was so wonderful and really became a friend of mine. He didn't budge, he would just sit in his own place looking at me. Not barking or anything, all night as I worked.”

Portraiture as a pretext

Among his greatest works were his early portraits. Padamsee treated portraiture as a pretext, approaching it only to leave it behind. At the Saffronart’s September sale (2018) his Untitled portrait had an elusiveness and aura of exclusivity. The English scholar and critical theorist Homi K. Bhabha wrote, “...this illusive, enigmatic look is what gives the work its presence... the look here, is not the kind that makes the spectator feel immediately identified. It invites and at the same time elides his look, so it is more like a gaze.”

It was in the late 1950s that Akbar Padamsee first turned from figuration to the landscape as the primary mode of his artistic expression. The period coincided with frequent travels betweenMumbai and Paris. These two cities inspired monumental grey landscapes and architectonic views of city roofs respectively. Subsequently, in the mid-1960s, he travelled to North America on a John D. Rockefeller III fellowship where his landscapes took on a more experimental character, laying the foundation for a major transformation in his practice in the 1970s.

Colours for him were soft and suffused. He would say, “It’s far more exciting for me as a painter, to work in grey or sepia. The brush can move freely from figure to ground, and this interaction offers me immense formal possibilities.”

Landscapes for Padamsee represented experimentation and expression. In later years, he favoured a perceptual and atmospheric style. His cubist architectonic forms gave way to warm earthy hues translating into an experiential and sensory semblance. Deliberately nebulous, Padamsee perfected the terrain between representation and abstraction.

Metascapes and Shakuntalam

Padamsee’s works were born out of literary reflections and in-depth philosophy. He chanted shlokas/verses with a gentle eloquence. When one asked him about the idea of using the sun and moon in his metascapes, he said, “This originated when I was reading the introductory stanza to ‘Abhijnanashakuntalam’. Here Kalidasa speaks of the eight visible forms of the Lord without mentioning them by name, the sun and the moon as the two controllers of time, water as the origin of all life, fire as the link between man and god, and the earth as the source of all seed. I was exploring adding poetic meaning to create new forms from nature.”

In 2005, at his studio in Mumbai, in front of a magnificent Metascape, he explained. “It talks about all the senses and the eight elements. I use the sun and moon and water. Earth and water and fire I use. It is actually Shiva’s Metascape. Shiva, as an element, is fire. But I don’t use the word Shiva, I call it Metascapes,” he explained to the writer. “Expression must contain its dialectical opposite, the conscious and the unconscious on the same physic plane. I have two eyes, two retinas, but the mind compounds the two images into one.”

Dynamism of movement

Padamsee spent a lifetime probing the subtleties of human existence through his work. The critic who offered in-depth insights into Padamsee’s works is Ranjit Hoskote. “With Akbar's passing, I lose another early mentor – one who offered me his generous guidance both in aesthetic and practical matters. Among the shared interests that brought us together was our common preoccupation with Sanskrit and rasa aesthetics. I was 20 when I first met him, at which point he had long ago mastered both the language and the theory, and I was studying both formally. Akbar could open up enormous horizons, whether on colour field abstraction, mathematics, language, yoga, or Shaiva philosophy. Over the years, I wrote about various bodies of work that he produced, ranging from his metascapes through his series of heads to his experiments with computer graphics. He, for his part, always responded with intensity and generosity to my writing across genres. ‘People will always be asking for your writing on art,’ he would tell me. ‘But never forget that you are a poet.’

Akbar was a great inspiration. His affinity for the most essential forms and colours came from early childhood impressions, and his work, despite being quite abstract at times, can be very emotional. I find this stuff more inspiring, more future-looking than anything going on today in the art or film world.

Spiritual and truly transcendental quality

Among the Progressives, Akbar was one of my favourites. He was gentle, thoughtful, deeply philosophical and truly committed to his work. He stood apart because he had a rare understanding and immense knowledge of Indian history and ancient literature. Remember he was not born into a Hindu family but he was so well read, so informed about Kalidasa and great works of Indian poets including ancient texts. In today’s world he sets a great example for other artists to follow. The beauty is that he successfully implemented all that he knew and felt into his metascapes. They had a spiritual and truly transcendental quality. We have lost a great artist and thinker who had invented his own language in his works over more than six decades.

232,2020/01/09,Meet artist Archana Pereira who brings alive iconic Bengaluru spots,"It was while doing an elective as part of her Master’s in Architecture in Glasgow that Archana Pereira (30), founder of Ink Trails, realised something. “I had to sketch the places I visited and tell a story in that. That was the beginning of what was to come.”

After returning to Bengaluru, she did a series on the city which included artwork on the traffic (of course!). “The response on social media was good. Then in 2016, I was selected for the Young Talent Programme by Alliance Française de Bangalore, which was basically for a solo exhibition where the Bangalore artworks were displayed. That is when I started getting a lot of projects. I could not focus on architecture so I moved to this. Now it is completely illustrations,” she laughs.

Explaining the process of how she creates her artworks, (it takes a week or a week and-a-half for an A3 size work), Archana says, “Coming up with the idea has everything to do with travel, culture and heritage of a place, and its architecture. That is illustrated maybe in the form of a map or a landmark is captured as it is with pencil and then pen and ink with watercolours as a highlight.”

Adding that though people appreciated the art, not everyone bought just artworks, she says that she started converting it into usable products such as stationery and home décor. At her studio, on Residency Road, which was set up in July 2018, one can browse through A3 prints, notebooks, bookmarks, postcards, coasters, magnets, lamps and even limited edition puzzles! Expect to see intricate drawings of iconic Bengaluru structures and establishments such as Koshy’s, Airlines Hotel and State Central Library. There are even illustrations of Spiti Valley and Chand Baori in Rajasthan and a distinctive lorry.

On how she decides what to illustrate, Archana says, “I look for cities or places that have a story to tell. The Bangalore series happened because I am here and from here. I feel I haven’t yet done justice to the city. I also did a few series on Mumbai, including one on Irani cafes. There is so much heritage and history in the buildings there.”

As for her future plans, Archana says, “I have just begun a new series on the blooms and trees of Bangalore against the landmarks of the city. I also started this series of 100 days of Incredible India where I was supposed to do one artwork every day for 100 days. It is aimed at bringing out lesser-known facts and creating awareness about places.”

Prices start at ₹30 for bookmarks and go up to ₹2,500 for lamps. Custom and corporate orders are also taken. Ink Trails is at 3/18 (above Café TBL ), on Residency Road.

233,2020/01/09,There is an increase in art workshops in Bengaluru,"Art is an antidote to modern living. As our lives get hectic the need to unwind and engage with an uplifting activity has become a necessity. Bengaluru, the IT Capital, has working professionals yearning to explore their creativity. Hence, it comes as no surprise that over the years, spaces have mushroomed across the city that offer workshops enabling people to express themselves through art.

Take the Hobby Place, for example. Located in the leafy neighbourhood of Langford Town, The Hobby Place, since its inception in June 2019, has conducted workshops on painting and pottery. It also offers art workshops for learners and professionals. Savitha Ranga, founder of The Hobby Place, says: “We have workshops throughout the week. On weekdays, housewives frequent our space, while on weekends working professionals and children come. At the workshops, you can make your own work of art, customise it and take it home. Anyone can walk in between 9 am and 7 pm, the only requirement is to call ahead of time.”

Bloom and Grow, in Koramangala, was started in 2013 by Pooja Kachroo and Carol Pinto. Their aim was to have a space where individuals could explore their creativity. Today, they conduct workshops from resin art and shibori to batik and pyro art. “At the time we started Bloom and Grow, there were no spaces where adults could explore their creativity. So we decided to focus on workshops for adults,” says Carol, adding: “These days we have tied up with corporates.”

The Living Walls, set up by Sridhar Upadhyay in July 2018, is yet another space that offers workshops where you can make your own works of art, under the guidance of an artist and take the finished product back home. “I started The Living Walls because I am passionate about art. After working 20 years in the corporate sector, I was not enjoying it any more. Art is an important part of our lives, from the way we dress to the way we decorate our homes—every aspect of our lives is governed by art. With art workshops we seek to balance both our artistic and logical sides.”

Sridhar says they work with 20 to 30 artists. “In these workshops, we teach 15 to 20 different art styles, such as oil, watercolours, glass, clay modelling, clay caricatures, pencil sketching. We now conduct workshops almost everyday, in batches from 9.30 am to 11.30 am, 12 noon to 3 pm and 3.30 pm to 6.30 pm.” He adds that working professionals, children keen on learning art, and senior citizens attend these workshops. “We have people between the age of five and 85 attend our workshops.”

Though The Living Walls is located in Kumaraswamy Layout, they partner with different groups in HSR layout and Koramangala, to conduct workshops. “We have partnered with corporates and we had recently completed a workshop with Amazon for employee engagement,” says Sridhar.

Zee5 Loft, though a restaurant, has been conducting several exciting art events, from a palette knife painting party to canvas painting of Frida Kahlo. Sabin Kumar, Assistant Brand Manager, Zee5 loft, says: “We started art workshops last year as we did not want people to come in for just the ambience and food. We started getting artists on board and they conducted workshops over the weekend. There is a lot of variety — charcoal to glass painting. It has now become a hub for artists. One outlet is in Koramangala, HSR and one in Kammanhalli. Our target audience is people aged from 21 to 45-50.”

With art events being conducted frequently at Cubbon Park, more and more people are taking to art to express their creative side.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/m2xpah/article30524011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08bgmthelivingwallsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/there-is-an-increase-in-art-workshops-in-bengaluru/article30524012.ece
234,2020/01/09,"When artistic inspiration blooms, as Mahakavi Kumaran Asan's painting","Poet, social reformer and entrepreneur Mahakavi Kumaran Asan (12 April 1873 – 16 January 1924) continues to be one the best loved poets in Malayalam. Over the years, many have paid homage to him in different ways. Recently, Sujit Sivanand, a management consultant and former KPMG partner, honoured the great poet by unveiling a one-metre wide portrait in Canada. The portrait by Spanish hyper-realist painter Antonio Guzmán Capel is titled ‘La flor caída’ or ‘The Fallen Flower’, after one of Kumaran Asan’s best-known poems by the same name, ‘Veenapoovu’.

Sujit commissioned the work in 2009 and worked closely with Antonio for months. The two worked in tandem although they lived in two continents - North America and Europe. “It is not easy for an artist like Antonio, coming from a different ethnic background, to fully grasp the facial features of a foreign subject,” explains Sujit in an email interview. So, he helped Antonio get the likeness perfectly right by sending him images of paintings with Indian subjects, and digitally reviewing and comparing minute facial features with existing black-and-white photographs of the poet. Excerpts from an email interview with Sujit...

Sujit Sivanand | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

Where did you get the original photograph from?

The original black and white portrait has been in the public domain for many decades now. A large framed print of it was at the Asan Memorial School in Madras (Chennai), back in the 1970s. The same image (in a smaller format) was published in The Asan Album, a collection of photographs published in a booklet form by Sharada Book Depot (the publishing company that Asan himself had set up).

Although the original photograph was shot in a studio background, it has some sort of enchantment in the setting. The subject (Asan) was set on a 1/3rd of the frame—following the popular ‘rule of thirds’ in photography. Somehow the original photo itself was not sharp, as the subject had moved while the exposure was captured on slow-speed film of those days. So one side of Asan’s face was blurred and distorted in the photograph.

Any idea where the photograph was taken?

No. It is surely a studio photo, as is evident from the painted background. The foreground has real furniture and properties on the table.

How did you locate the artist, Antonio Guzmán Capel?

The idea of turning the old photograph of Kumaran Asan into a work of art came to my mind about 15 years ago. From that point onwards, I was on the search for an artist who had the skills for realism in portrait art and also the ability for impressionistic textures in creating the background scenery. It was about 12 years ago that I noted Antonio Guzmán Capel’s art on the Internet, particularly his painting of Spanish matadors and bullfighting. His usage of colours was vivid, but overall it was all earthen and very Spanish-terracotta hued. His scenes had cobbled floors, which I liked. Overall, I like his style of texturing and usage of colours, so I began following him closely and observing his works in detail. Finally, around early 2009 I contacted him and shared with him the idea of a portrait of the early twentieth-century celebrity poet from Travancore. He knows only Spanish but Google translator has worked seamlessly to foster our friendship and exchange of ideas to create this work of art.

Artist’s take Antonio Guzmán Capel explains what were the challenges of completing ‘La flor caída’...

The picture of Kumaran Asan was commissioned by Sujit Sivanand about 10 years ago. There were pleasant moments of inspiration at the beginning and even more while finishing the work. However, having to solve the portrait of the poet from a black and white photograph of very low quality sometimes made it difficult for me to work on the composition, since I had to include other elements on the table (objects not in the original photograph) that during the years would have changed in their form. I could not just do those elements without convincing myself (of their original form a hundred years ago). The same happened to me with the garden and park in the background. After that, it was easy for me to finish it with the help of Sujit in terms of details such as the flower on the books, the checkered floor—to get more depth, and the photographic close-ups of the portrait Sujit sent back to me to be able to succeed in all his (Kumaran’s) facial expression. In the end what we have is a very consistent painting where changes in the original objects are not noticeable. It has been a pleasure to paint such an important poet in India. And I am very grateful to Sujit Sivanand for choosing me to paint Kumaran Asan.

What were your instructions or requests, if any, for the artist to follow?

Firstly, I created an online album of photographs of Asan’s portraits. Asan’s granddaughter Nalini Vijayaraghavan and her son Krishnan helped me with compiling the photos. I added Spanish language descriptions to each photograph and shared the album with Capel.

Secondly, I created a detailed document of (bi-lingual) instructions on the imagery to be depicted on the canvas, which I wanted Capel to create based on the old photograph. These instructions included the creation of a realistic outdoor setting of a floral garden (Pushpavaadi is also the title of a collection of Asan's poems).

Also about five years ago, I had sent Capel a copy of Parsram Mangharam’s book Raja Ravi Varma: The Painter Prince. This was to familiarise the artist with the attire and skin tones of the people of Travancore about a century ago. Capel treasures that book and he has told me that he keeps that book in a very special place in his house in Palencia, Spain.

The toughest part of the portrait was to get the subject’s facial expression in the way I wanted it. The original photo has some distortion of facial features, which had to be corrected using other portrait photos of Asan. Also, we wanted to add a very subtle smile as well as melancholy on the face, something like Mona Lisa's expression, where the observer does not really know if the subject is sad or happy. There needed to be an expression on the face based on the way the observer looked at the painting —for those who seek sadness they see the sadness, and for those who seek the smile they see the smile. This is the part that took the most amount of time between Capel and me to get it perfectly right. I appreciate Capel for his patience and willingness to do those minute corrections, after each time I analysed the picture on digital screens and went back to him asking for changes. Capel is a true ‘maestro del Arte’ and a perfectionist too, so he was fine with doing corrections no matter how many times.

Would you describe how people reacted when they saw this painting of the poet?

People were initially getting to see just the photograph of the painting that Capel and I shared on social media in mid-November in 2019 when the painting was completed. Only Capel and his wife, Marian Lopez Aguado, also an artist, had seen the real painting until it was shipped to Canada. The painting was installed in my home in Canada just before Christmas time, and more people are getting to see the real painting. Those who are seeing the image now are captivated by the hyper-realism in the portrait, which is the ‘likeness’ to Kumaran Asan's facial features and the very mesmerising outdoor setting of the floral garden. Capel says it's his Christmas present to me and my wife, Binu.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/r5rczq/article30513897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvfFallenFlower,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/sujit-sivanand-celebrated-malayalams-beloved-poet-mahakavi-kumaran-asan-by-commissioning-spanish-painter-antonio-guzmn-capel-to-paint-his-portrait-from-an-old-black-and-white-photo-of-the-poet/article30513899.ece

These questions were deliberated by musicians, dancers and scholars at the Fifth International Conference on Music and Dance (ICMD) 2020, organised by Indiranagar Sangeeta Sabha in Bengaluru.

On the first day of the conference, R.N.S. Saileswari, Assistant Professor, Sri Padmavati Mahila Visvavidyalayam, Tirupati explained the various institutions of music and their respective advantages and disadvantages. “If gurukula system of learning provided 24/7 access to the guru and also inculcated guru’s habits and disciple in the student, home tuitions restricted student’s learning to only music. Whereas the present-day web learning is crisper. But at the same time, we should not ignore the opportunities internet has provided for students to learn music from anywhere in the world,” observed Saileswari.

Chairing the session, veteran mridangist Trichy Sankaran remarked: “University as an institution of music has also played its role. Development of musical notations, comparative and systematic studies of music wouldn’t have been possible without it.” He further suggested that there should be distinguished teachers and regular training at the university. “Private tuitions could also be carried out simultaneously for a deeper understanding of music,” he added.

Speaking about the need of creating internship opportunities for students in music colleges, Anuradha Suresh, Founder, Shruti Swara Laya, a music school in Fremont, observed: “Music students find it hard to begin their profession after their degrees because music is seldom seen as a career. Therefore, if colleges tie up with major sabhas of the city and send their students for internships, it would place them in a better position in the cultural field.” She felt these institutional mechanisms would help students from the lower socio-economic groups and suggested that a separate position should be created for this purpose in the music departments.

If Anuradha felt the need to catch up with other disciplines in the modern scenario, vocalist Subhalakshmi Krishnamoorthy stressed on the applications of technology in the music and dance world. Languages of both these presentations focused on the importance of ‘networking and technology’ for a splendid performance or career, and did not reflect on its far reaching effects on music.

Responding to Anuradha’s presentation, Trichy Sankaran said: “I never learnt music for the purpose of performing. First of all, music is not just another subject. Don’t you think these moves would commodify the art more? And what about quality?”

“Focus has to be on music during the learning stage. All other skills are secondary. If the focus itself is interfered with, you lose the whole game.” responded Hindustani vocalist, Nagaraj Rao Havaldar who was among the audience. “Teaching music on the web would be fine if the student is already initiated into music,” felt another connoisseur in the audience.

Sankaran, Havaldar and sitarist, Indrani Chakravarti discussed these matters at length in a panel discussion on ‘achieving cultural exchanges through music and dance across the globe’. Emphasising on openness towards other cultures of music, Sankaran said: “Coming from a Carnatic tradition, I was looking for the ‘sum’ the first time I listened to African music. After a while, I told myself, ‘forget the sum, just go with the flow’. Such cultural biases might creep in while receiving music from other traditions, but respect and understanding save us from chauvinistic tendencies.”

Respect diversity Nagaraj Rao Havaldar, Anuradha Suresh and Trichy Sankaran

If Sankaran stressed on respecting diversity of music, Indrani spoke about respecting and getting adapted to guru’s tradition and students’ requirements. “As my guru followed Tansen’s tradition, he played on a 17-fret sitar and taught me the same. But as most of my students learn and perform on a 19-fret sitar, I teach them on that instrument. These adjustments have to be made by a teacher in the present scenario,” felt Indrani.

She also spoke on the oral tradition of Indian classical arts and emphasised on its continuation. Remembering his first guru, Panchakshari Swamy Mattigatti who suffered from dementia in his later years, Nagaraj Rao Havaldar recalled: “Although he suffered from memory loss, he would sing any malhar bandish without any difficulty! That was the power of his training.”

Oral tradition thrived in the gurukula system. “My another guru Madhav Gudi who had just slept after learning a Darbari from his guru Pt. Bhimsen Joshi, was woken up Raga Todi lessons around 2 a.m. Although the system comes with immense hardships, the student would reap the benefits later in life. Madhav Gudi had once told me that he felt so grateful to the Pandit for what he taught him on that particular night,” narrated Havaldar.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/n6qgr6/article30523149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGFRTRICHYSANKARAN-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/what-cultures-music/article30523151.ece
236,2020/01/09,Can a vigilante be an anti-hero?,"Our love for vigilantes has no bounds. We live in a happy bubble thinking that there’s somebody out there who’s making the world a better place to breathe. And that’s why we adore our comic book superheroes so much. We keep cheering them on while they move from strength to strength trying to fight the evil men in the society. We don’t do it ourselves because we don’t like getting our hands dirty. But how do you judge a hero who’s also a villain in many stories? I’m talking about Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) in Netflix’s latest sensation, You.

The second season hit the streaming platform last month and people seem to have lapped it up immediately. And since memes are de rigueur, they’ve been flooding the social media sites since day one. The plot points haven’t gone in a different direction this time, which make several scenes appear as though they were lifted from the first season, but the new installment dives deeper into what made Joe choose the murderous path. The flashback episode isn’t narrated in a single uncut-piece. It’s rather chopped into tiny bits and sprinkled throughout the ten-episode season so that Joe’s childhood gets revealed in parts. Amazon Prime’s Made in Heaven used this method of storytelling to show how Tara (Sobhita Dhulipala), a middle-class employee, ended up getting married to a rich businessman (played by Jim Sarbh), and, stepped into the shocking echelons of the elite.

In You, the viewers get a clear picture about how Joe was tortured by his father when he was young. His mother was beaten black and blue by his dad every day and that made him pick up the gun to put a full stop to it. Hence, now in his adulthood, he feels a certain kind of responsibility towards teenagers. He’s gone through the drill before, so he doesn’t want other teenagers to suffer his fate. However, his moral understanding of the good and the bad end there. Even in the second season, he puts a man in a cage and steals his identity (he takes his name Will Bettelheim) as Candace (Ambyr Childers), his ex-girlfriend, comes back from the dead to expose him.

When he accidentally kills a celebrity, in Los Angeles, who preys on teenaged girls (the celeb drugs them and takes their pictures), he considers himself to be a true hero even if he doesn’t say so himself. He thinks he’s protecting his 15-year-old neighbor (played by Jenna Ortega) and numerous other kids. What he doesn’t fathom, nevertheless, is that he’s a murderer himself. His victims are just not unsuspecting adolescents! Though You, which is based on Caroline Kepnes’ novel Hidden Bodies, is a thriller, a major chunk of the season focuses on the budding romance between Joe and Love (Victoria Pedretti).

Ottessa Moshfegh’s 2016 novel, Eileen, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, is a thriller at its heart. But, in a similar way, it begins with the mundane life that its eponymous protagonist is living. Set in the 1960s, Eileen’s work in the prison for the juveniles is mingled with the dull chores she does at home. When she befriends her new co-worker, Rebecca, in the latter portions, the story takes a turn wherein she gets involved in a high-risk ploy to get a confession from a mother of a teenager who helped her husband rape their only son. In fact, the mother goes out of her way to make things work for all of them instead of taking action. She feels contended that her husband comes back to her bed refreshed and doesn’t regret the hardships she puts her child through.

Here, Rebecca and Eileen aren’t like Joe. They belong to a kid-friendly, girls-next-door group, and they simply want the mother to pay for her sins. They’re not women who’ve been on a killing spree throughout their adulthoods either. Even though, You and Eileen cannot be accommodated in the same aisle, there’s a sense of shared trauma in both the works.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/g4ebdx/article30523113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10bgfrKarthik02jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/can-a-vigilante-be-an-anti-hero/article30523120.ece
237,2020/01/09,This Kerala artist conjures up a world of art using seashells,"For self-taught artist and nature lover Sreeja Kalappurakkal, “anything” can be a canvas to express one’s imagination. Having previously worked on feather and stone art, Sreeja then tried her hand at sea shells. Looking for a new medium, she realised there could not be a more “eco-friendly” canvas.

Art exhibition ‘Luminous’, which opened on Tuesday at Vyloppilly Samskrithi Bhavan, showcases a collection of 150-odd artwork embellished with seashells. While the ‘shell paintings’, where large pieces of mother of pearl turn canvas, depict nature, wildlife and slice-of-life scenes, “shell collages” such as a Buddha figure and a large “pendant” hung on the wall form other creative works pieced together using the exoskeleton. Eschewing “inorganic” materials, the paintings are affixed to jute and wooden frames. The largest shell painting, which depicts a lion, is about 25-cm wide and the longest one, showing two giraffes, 40-cm long.

“I want my works to reflect the importance of nature conservation and adopting an eco-friendly way of life both on a literal and figurative level. Perhaps, the only exception is the use of acrylic since other painting materials I tried would come off or smudge easily,” says Sreeja, a member of OISCA International that works towards nature conservation. She, however, finds that working on the convex surfaces is challenging to get the “perspective and symmetry” spot on.

Apart from the paintings, the highlights of the display are replicas of Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple and Vadakkunnathan Temple in Thrissur, all fashioned out of hundreds of sea shells sourced from across the country. “Often, sourcing the right type of shells is a difficult task as they have to be symmetrical, undamaged and of the required size,” says Sreeja, who resides in Thrissur.

The central supporting frameworks for the temple replicas, which make use of smaller spiky shell varieties measuring between 1 cm to 3.5 cm long, are made out of teak. Sreeja says it took her about three months each to put together the temple models. Shells are also used as adornments on decorative pots that are part of the collection.

Sreeja says she sources the shells from several coastal towns such as Kanyakumari and Rameswaram, depending on the type required. “For the mother of pearls, Kanyakumari and Rameswaram are my go-to places mostly. By now, I know beachcombers and shell vendors who contact me when they collect shells of the variety I can use. For the temples replicas, I have sourced shells mainly from Mumbai, Surat, Kutch (Gujarat) and Kolkata,” she says. Being much sought-after and considered a valuable decoration, Sreeja says she often has to shell out a good sum to purchase them from vendors.

The Nilambur-based artist, who holds a place in the Limca book of records for her feather art, says she started collecting shells in 2017 and began her “experiments” with the curved canvas a year later. An avid traveller, she also relies on her “photographer friends” to lend beautiful subjects, especially of nature and wildlife, for her work.

Transportation of the “delicate” works for shows and exhibitions is something Sreeja finds tricky and she has to be “extra careful” with the process. “On such occasions, there’s no escaping the use of bubblewraps and thermocols,” she says.

Formerly an art teacher with a private school, Sreeja later quit her job to devote time to pursue her “passion” for art.

238,2020/01/09,Interesting interpretations,"Mythili Prakash twirled onto a darkened stage, lit only by a horizontal beam of light from the wings, and as she struck a pose, Subramania Bharati’s ‘Sivashakti koothu’ (Sivashakti, Adi, tuned by Lalitha Shivakumar) began. As the devotee joyfully proclaimed the divine mother in the pallavi ‘Tagat tagat..’, the dancer’s movements were athletic and precise. She was accompanied by full-throated singing (Sushma Somasekharan), a la Mythili’s musician brother Aditya Prakash, who accompanied her earlier; somehow one feels her style is much suited to this music.

The sringara-bhakti padavarnam on Andal, ‘Aatkolla vendum Aiyyane’ was an original, penned by mridangist G.Vijayaraghavan, tuned by K. Hariprasad in ragamalika. The varnam jathis (Mythili) had interesting ideas woven in, such as the phrase ‘Dheenutha tha dheem’ used as a refrain and the sudden doubling of speed in the theermana adavus in one, the repeated ‘kitatakatharikitathom’ sollus throughout the tisra jathi, etc.

Mythili is known for her sharp and often fiery nritta; that being said, it was less fiery but no less sharp this time. The energy and clean lines came as no surprise then, but the detailing of the interpretive portions was unexpected and very impressive.

Maturity showed in little things — in her general demeanour, and specifically in instances such as in Devi’s expression in the invocation and during the varnam when the heroine recollects her childhood friendship with Krishna, she watching him in admiration as a child and as an adult, the face showing the contrast between the then and the now, while in the same seated posture. The delineation for each line held interest — the physical aspect of wanting to be his conch, close to his lips, of wanting to be Adisesha, his snake-bed, et al, as well as the garland episode in the line ‘Soodi thandaal’. There was no theatrics, but the more powerful alternative, restrained role-play.

The highest point of the recital was, however, during the welcome of the untrustworthy friend in ‘Unnai thoodu anuppinen’ (Saveri, Adi, Ghanam Krishnaier), when anxiety at the delay turns to an excited welcome, which turns into shock on noting her friend’s dishevelled appearance and the subsequent anger at the recognition of betrayal. The transition from mood to mood was handled delicately. Mythili should, however, face the audience a bit more. The narrator in ‘Rusli Radha rusla Madhav’ (Yamunakalyani, etc) was an amused bystander detailing the effects of the standoff between Radha and Krishna; Sivaprasad (mridangam) played very sensitively to enliven the drama in Gokul. Mythili's other supporters, Kasi Aysola (nattuvangam) was always on point while Ishwar Ramakrishnan (violin) along with the singer created poetic melody. The recital concluded with a faster tempo Swati Tirunal Dhanashree thillana (Adi) and winded down with a Yamunakalyani prayer ‘Dhava vibho Prabhu’.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/4fwuv3/article30522741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FRMYTHILIPRAKASHBHARATHANATYAM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/impressive-interpretations/article30522742.ece
239,2020/01/09,A delight for the senses,"Spirituality in Indian arts has been a common theme for centuries. But to string it seamlessly across different mediums requires an eye for detail. At a recent exhibition titled “Shunya – A Journey”, artist Rita Jhunjhunwala and photographer Shreekant Somany collaborated to create a tapestry of the five elements or panchatattvas through paintings and photographs. The show included more than 60 works showcasing Jhunjhunwala’s mixed media works on paper inspired by Benaras and Somany’s photographs shot in across the Himalayas, including Kazakhstan, Ladakh, Spiti and Kashmir.

Says Jhunjhunwala, “What keeps me going back to Benares is the vibrancy, the energy, the visuals; these things attracted me initially. Over time, I have also gotten used to it. But every time there is a new aspect. I see more depth and spirituality behind it, which is why we have called it Shunya. It is the merging of five elements, which composes the entire world. I have also matured, I could see the ethereal beauty of it, rather than mere physical.”

For her paintings, Jhunjhunwala used different kinds of paper – handmade, acrylic, butter and even newspaper along with acrylic colours, watercolours, charcoal. “Even for a tourist, the city is a delight for the senses. And as an artist, I have never ceased to be amazed at how it makes me think about the cycle of birth and death every time. The philosophy of Benaras appeals to me because it compels me to think of us as part of the much bigger cosmos and how minuscule we are in its comparison,” she adds. Her painting called “Water” is a beautiful depiction of the Ganges on the ghats of Benares, with pilgrims praying alongside. The painting was displayed next to Shreekant Somany’s take on water, captured on the shores on Mansarovar Lake.

Shreekant Somany’s work

Shreekant Somany, primarily an industrialist, has been obsessed with the mountains from early on. “I have trekked in various places, gone up to 19000ft. The mountains are a part of nature which make you realise where you stand. Unless you are able to relate to yourself as a part of that nature, you can never relate to your self,” says Somany.

The photograph titled “Air” caught everyone’s eye. It turns out, on the way from Darchen to Ali in Tibet, Somany saw the majestic peak through the eye of a brewing storm. “It was a phenomenon worth stopping for and capturing,” says Somany. Jhunjhunwala depicts the same in her painting through “a sky brimming with the chatter of seagulls hovering around crowded boats and the floating scent of fresh marigolds and jasmines.” Similarly, the photograph titled Fire was shot on a winter morning flight to Leh. It depicted the hues of dawn, with the sun peeping from behind Nanda Devi. “Fire”, for Jhunjhunwala, is depicted through the consecrated flames of the huge oil lamps that circle around the priests in a holy dance amidst ringing of bells and chanting of mantras.

The theme of the five elements was both conscious and unconscious. “It would have been very boring to just put the pictures next to the paintings. But these pictures were depicting something and to my mind it came, why not elements, which was instantly agreed upon. Then, I started collecting my round pictures and matching them with the straight ones, to see how we could depict the elements. The biggest challenge was to find exact photographs that would depict the elements. Fire and water are easy. How do you depict ether and air? It was sheer luck,” adds Somany.

Another interesting display was “Weathered Wisdom” that showcased two sets of portrait photographs and their replicas in painting, of elderly people from Kohima. “I have always found that people from the mountains have wisdom engraved on their faces. They have weathered the storm of life. None of the people even knew I was taking their pictures. They are absolutely candid,” says Somany. To which, Jhunjhunwala adds, “I have tried to recreate the photographs but show their experiences through my paintings. There is wisdom but they are not bitter about it.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/mrtk0y/article30522644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Fire-mixed-media-on-paper-by-Rita-Jhunjhunwala,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/a-delight-for-the-senses/article30522646.ece
240,2020/01/09,Felicitations to S.Ve. Shekher,"Accolades rained on S.Ve. Shekher as celebrities from all walks of life felicitated him on December 26, his 70th birthday. The play ‘Comedy Darbar’ was staged as a fitting finale to an enjoyable evening, organised at MGR Janaki College for Women, Adyar, Chennai, by his troupe and well-wishers. A mix of the best scenes from his plays, it was a thorough entertainer. Shekher added to the laugh riot with his comments as he introduced the guests.

“Shekher’s good heart drew me here,” said Nalli Kuppusami Chetty. “I’ve known the actor ever since his younger days, when he was called the Comedy King. Decades ago, when people came under the spell of television, I wondered whether Tamil drama would disappear from stage. It was Shekher, who kept theatre alive with his plays. The Shekher-‘Crazy’ Mohan-Karthik Rajagopal combination made yeoman contribution to Tamil stage. I wish him a long life,” he said.

G.K. Vasan, political leader, said that Shekher was a multi-dimensional personality. “He is not only an actor, but a person inclined to serving society. He uses his political clout to help people in many ways. Shekher believes in god, loves his country and is not afraid to express his views. My best wishes to him,” he said.

Generous approach

Ramabhadran, an ardent fan of Shekhar, said that he had seen all his plays several times. “Shekher has staged plays more than 6,500 times, out of which I have seen 4,500. “He has given me the permission to walk in, wherever he is staging a play. Such is his magnanimity,” the admirer revealed.

The speakers who felicitated included Nellai Sampath, Sekar Rajagopal, Arun Sampath, V.S.V. (journalist) EVR. Mohan Kumar Rajendran (grandson of MGR), Abhaswaram Ramji and Anbazhagan from the fishing community association.

Shekher spoke at length on the social work done by his team of friends, including the members of his troupe Natakhapriya. He said that he was following in the footsteps of his father in serving the public.

“My father donated blood 8,500 times. His eyes were donated after his death. I’m organising at least 200 eye donations every month. Arranging the burial of unclaimed bodies is another activity. As an MLA, I was instrumental in getting a monthly salary to the workers in cemeteries.

“My father Venkatraman passed away on July 21, many years ago. On this day, every year, 200 cataract surgeries are arranged. Study material is provided for nearly 100 students every year. Nobody in Natakhapriya consumes alcohol. Our troupe is run like a trust. Money is ploughed into all the charity work mentioned above. We only pray that we get more opportunities and resource to help the less privileged,” he said.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/7ifzaf/article30522520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10frShekherJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/felicitations-to-sveshekher/article30522521.ece
241,2020/01/09,Maya Rao leads the way in art uprising,"In times marked by political turbulence, artists are exploring urgent and fresh ways to raise critical questions and respond to social impulses through art making. Scouring a wide range of creative expression like floor paintings, graffiti, invisible theatre, dance walks, slam poetry and protest songs, art is integrating with political action to stage synchrony of radical articulation. The recent past has witnessed artistic outpouring on the streets and social media alongside speeches and sloganeering, signalling a strong return of protest art.

We the people

In the women’s march in the capital on January 3, theatre artiste Maya Rao made a performance that involved draping the sari while reciting the Preamble to the Constitution accompanied by music. The aesthetic is derived from the urgency of the moment. Rao says, “Every time one can approach the Preamble from a different lens. In the context of the women’s march, I wanted to create devices that speak to women, and can be read with ease. The sari is not just a garment, it is layered socially and culturally. Many women wear the sari from girlhood till the day they die, and for an Indian woman, it is often a layering of her own skin.”

Street performances challenging gender norms are a massive part of Rao’s oeuvre. In the 1980s, the anti-dowry campaign found an artistic ally in street theatre. Part of much acclaimed street plays like ‘Om Swaha’, Rao feels that the genre is still as politically potent yet its prime objective has shifted with time. “In the traditional ways of making street theatre, it was important to provide the material, to inform people. Now, with television and media, that is already happening much faster. So, for street theatre, it is not about peeling apart an issue as it was earlier, but how to take it further and examine it through interesting artistic devices.”

young artists working on a graffiti

Sudhanva Deshpande, theatre artist, Jana Natya Manch, reflects, “Street theatre is a live art that combines so many different things from music and text to movement and poetry. In today’s context it is doubly important because it allows people to come together in a public space, to watch the performance together, bond, actively think and start conversations.” Pointing out that the internet and social media have brought in new forms of art and articulation, like memes, Deshpande emphasises, “Though media may appear democratic, it is not entirely so and is mostly disproportionate in terms of what it represents. Street theatre is a medium of the marginalised communities.”

Artists make critical choices about the extent to which they want to align their art and politics. Rao believes that it is crucial to give creative expression to important political moments. Some of the protesting women from Shaheen Bagh joined the march at Jantar Mantar and also wanted to be part of the performance. Winging it in the moment, along with artists, they all strung dupattas together, passing them around, adding on to them and holding them tightly as a rope, creating a motif of collective expression. For Rao, this is the gripping artistic challenge, “I am looking to make performances where a group of people can come together and make art in that moment without preparation, without rehearsals, almost in a folk form manner. In protest events, the time is scarce, the number of people is huge, and passion is high. My artistic curiosity is how we can channelise this energy into uplifting, thought-provoking collaborative art.”

Aesthetics of the street

Coming together to create collective artistic action, another protest on January 5 in central Delhi, invited people to inscribe terms such as ‘secular’ on the streets and pavements with chalk. Led by Artists Unite, protesters used multiple colours and a variety of shapes to chalk out the alphabets. Rahul Roy, filmmaker and one of the organisers from the artists’ collective says, “When we formed Artists Unite, we wanted to explore how one can express dissent apart from the usual speeches and sloganeering.”

Talking about the concept of chalk inscriptions, Roy reflects, “We were looking for a simple yet powerful action to sync well with the people and enable everyone to join.” As more people gathered around the protest sites, there were also attempts at erasing a part of the writing. The threat of censorship follows any kind of protest art. Roy points out that though they want to do radical critical comments as artists, it is important not to hurt sentiments. Dancer-choreographer Mandeep Raikhy adds, “Even a simple, peaceful, creative act like inscribing words on the road was not easy and we were interrupted, challenged and threatened for doing this.”

Using everyday movements as choreography, Raikhy devised a symbolic gesture where people gathered around the writing and went down on their knees in a gesture of prayer. The participants were free to interpret it as ‘sajda’ or ‘maatha tekna’ or just bowing in reverence. While some seemed hesitant about joining in this choreography, unsure of whether this was performance or actual prayer, there were others who followed with curiosity.

On ground and online

While artists are attempting to bring aesthetics to the streets, after the recent campus attacks, university spaces like Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University resemble a visual art gallery. Here students have found their expression in graffiti and floor paintings, covering the university walls and roads with a daily exhibition. Painting in groups of 3-4 people, the students use spray cans, emulsion paints and acrylic to translate their ideas into images. Some works display only text like ‘peace’ written across the road, much like the chalk inscriptions in central Delhi. There are others in the format of a protest poster where text and visuals merge to create a statement. The visuals cite common symbols from political posters of yesteryears like the fist and flag. Others capture the contemporary movement as images of Shaheen Bagh women make their way into the floor paintings. One of the works brings together a portrait of Gandhi alongside the text –‘There are many causes I would die for, not a single cause I would kill for.’

A student (name withheld on request) pursuing her Masters in Visual Effects and Animation, AJK, MCRC, says, “It is a silent, creative protest. Being students of art and media, we wanted to express ourselves in a relatable visual way where people can understand what is happening, what we want to say, and how it affects the entire nation.”

Faculty member, Anugyan Nag, agrees that the art works have generated impactful responses and go a long way in rebuilding the spirits of the students. “This art movement has emerged spontaneously from the students. They have experienced fear, violence and trauma in the same spaces a few weeks back, and it is important for them to reclaim the space as a site of resurrection, resistance and love through these art works.”

While visual political art, from posters to comics, has been a radical form of dissent traditionally, the medium has taken on a new life with art works and images going viral speedily on social media. Much of the art is work in progress, yet artists are closely imagining ways of bringing communities together through collaborative actions. As new mediums of socially engaged art swoop through protest sites, public places and social media, artists are rising up to the challenge of creating safe spaces of expression at the intersection of politics and aesthetics.

A cartoon by Rachita Taneja

Artist Rachita Taneja recently conducted sessions on protest posters with the students at Jamia. Her comic series, “Sanitary Panels”, started five years ago, has generated much enthusiasm on social media. An activist invested in human rights and environment issues, Taneja started the comic as a response to the arrest of students for posting their opinions online. “I named the comic so because I wanted it to be representative of what it would talk about – all that is controversial, taboo. Some of the images from my comics that have gone viral have also been used at protests where people have drawn it themselves. Writing the text is the more challenging part of the idea. My style keeps switching, sometimes I draw on the phone as ideas emerge, sometimes I write first. It is all in the moment and responses from people range from trolling and threats to appreciation.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ssw2vn/article30521869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Maya-Rao-performing-in-Delhi-on-3-January-Womens-March,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/maya-rao-leads-the-way-in-art-uprising/article30521874.ece
242,2020/01/09,PDP’s Baigh blames Mehbooba for J&K situation,"Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) patron Muzaffar Hussain Baigh on Thursday took potshots at jailed party president Mehbooba Mufti and backed the demands to restore statehood and grant domicile laws on land and jobs.

“Ms. Mufti made a wrong statement that ‘If Article 370 is scrapped no one will raise the national flag in J&K’. It should not have been made. You cannot threaten Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval to get your demands fulfilled,” said Mr. Baigh at a press conference here.

He said the PM, the HM and the NSA understand the people of J&K and “were not anti-Muslims”. “Statehood as promised by them should be restored. For the last five months, no bullet has been fired in Kashmir even as shops remained closed. If we are thinking that China and Pakistan will leave the occupied J&K land and then, we will restore statehood, then we don’t think there are chances of getting it back,” he said.

The former J&K Dy. CM said the recent changes in J&K “have worried ethnic and cultural communities irrespective of communities i.e. Dogra, Sikh, Gujjar, Pahari, Kashmiri”.

“Excluding IAS-IPS jobs, local people should get the right of jobs including gazetted and non-gazetted since J&K is also a hilly State like the northeast. India understands the sentiments of people and recently asked the High Court to withdraw the job advertisement,” he said.

He also blamed the Hurriyat for the current situation. “Hurriyat in 2016 closed their doors and did not hold talks with the delegation of parliamentarians, who had come to Kashmir for dialogue. Perhaps this prepared the ground and the special status was scrapped by the BJP.”

243,2020/01/09,"Kota deaths: People from govt. can also ask questions, says Gehlot on criticism by Pilot","Reacting for the first time to the criticism over the death of infants at a Kota hospital by his deputy Sachin Pilot, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday said people from both opposition and the government could ask questions.

He stressed it was Mr. Pilot’s right to raise the issue as he also held the post of the state Congress chief.

“Mr. Pilot is the Pradesh Congress Committee president. It is his right to say this about the government. It is not the opposition only, which could ask questions. People from the government could also ask questions,” said Mr. Gehlot.

Mr. Pilot, after a visit to Kota’s J K Lon Hospital, had told the media that the death of infants was a serious matter and the government could not be spared of its accountability.

“We have to fix accountability. After 13 months of being in government, it may not serve any purpose to keep pointing towards the previous government. We have to face responsibility and consequences. People expect us to deliver,” Mr. Pilot had said.

Talking to the media, Mr. Gehlot here at the airport said Mr. Pilot should give suggestions and say openly about any lacunaes.

“I have no problem with it as it would ensure good governance,” the Chief Minister said.

He also termed the deaths a conspiracy against the state government and said those who died had come from outside.

“It was a conspiracy against the government. In order to propagate a word on it, media from Delhi was called. It was done on purpose close on the heels of the Nirogi Rajasthan launch,” he said, adding that only time would tell who were behind it.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1tjazy/article30525148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GHELOTANDPILOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kota-deaths-people-from-govt-can-also-ask-questions-says-gehlot-on-criticism-by-pilot/article30525150.ece
244,2020/01/09,Farmers’ stir in Rajasthan: Health of protester buried neck-deep in ground deteriorates,"The health of one of the five farmers who buried themselves neck-deep in the ground over the alleged land acquisition by the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) for a housing project deteriorated on Thursday but he refused to leave the protest site at Nindar village.

Demanding that their land be acquired as per the revised Land Acquisition Act and compensation be given accordingly, farmers from the village located on the outskirts of Jaipur are holding ‘Zameen Samadhi Satyagrah’

As part of the protest, five people have taken ‘Zameen Samadhi’ (burying themselves neck-deep in the ground) in the last two days.

“Health of one of the protesters deteriorated but an officer of the JDA today met us. We have apprised him of our demands. He has asked one-day for giving the reply,” Nagendra Singh Shekhawat, a leader of Nindar Bachao Yuva Kisan Sangarsh Samiti, said.

“We will continue to hold satyagrah and more people will take ‘Zameen Samadhi’ till the reply from the JDA comes. If the response is positive then our dialogue with the government will proceed,” he said.

Protesters are demanding that State government implement the amended Land Acquisition Act, which was passed by the Congress government at the Centre and acquire the land as per it.

Mr. Shekhawat said farmers will not let the government acquire the land as per the previous Land Acquisition Act, which was running in the country since British rule.

The Jaipur Development Authority, in a statement, had said that it would issue allotment letters to farmers affected due to the Nindar Housing Scheme with mutual understanding.

Deputy Commissioner Manish Fauzdar said those farmers who have surrendered their land for the housing scheme will soon be issued allotment letters and those who have not yet surrendered their land will be issued letters with mutual consent.

The farmers had launched a similar protest in October 2017 and some of them had even gone on a hunger strike.

The protesters are against the acquisition of more than 1,300 bighas of land for a housing project.

The JDA has taken possession of 600 bighas of land so far and deposited ₹60 crore in a local court as compensation for it after villagers refused to accept the amount, claiming it did not hold up to the prevailing market rates.

245,2020/01/09,Hopes for mass nesting of Olive Ridley turtles at Rushikulya increase,"“Large crowd mating” of Olive Ridley turtle couples in the sea near the Rushikulya rookery on the Odisha coast over the last leg of a continuing mass mating occurrence has increased hopes for mass nesting at this coast later this year.

In 2019, mass nesting of the enigmatic marine reptiles did not occur at the Rushikulya rookery, a major mass nesting site for Olive Ridley turtles on the Indian coast. However, in 2018, there was double mass nesting at this coast, in February and April, with over 4,73,000 nests totally.

Numbers spike

Olive Ridley turtles begin arriving for mass mating at the sea near Rushikulya rookery from November. Their mating numbers spike up and reach their peak from December 15 to January 15. Although the peak mass mating season is about to end, hundreds of pairs of mating sea turtles can still be seen in the sea, at distance of about 5 km from the coast.

After mating, male turtles turn back, while the females remain at the sea near the rookery for mass nesting, which usually starts in the third week of February.

Sporadic nesting by about a dozen mother Olive Ridleys has already occurred alongside the mass mating. “The eggs collected from the sporadic nesting sites are incubated in artificial hatcheries of the Forest Department,” said Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Amlan Nayak. Eleven artificial hatcheries have come up at the Rushikulya rookery for safe incubation of Olive Ridley eggs that are laid before mass nesting commences.

Preparations

In February, wire fencing will be erected on a stretch of over 5 km to protect nests and eggs during a mass nesting. The Forest Department has already set up 11 on-shore camps over a 5 km stretch of beach from Purunabandha to Prayagi near the mouth of the Rushikulya river. Personnel at these camps regularly document conditions, protect the beach, track debris deposited by the sea, stop the entry of predators like stray dogs, and look out for turtle carcasses that may float to the coast.

The sea near this coast is regularly patrolled by two trawlers, two speedboats and a country boat, to prevent harm to Olive Ridleys from illegal fishing trawlers. Local villagers and social organisations are helping clean this stretch of coast every alternate day.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/e7ca0g/article30524627.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hopes-for-mass-nesting-of-olive-ridley-turtles-at-rushikulya-increase/article30524628.ece
246,2020/01/09,Punjab to set up 7 fast-track courts to try rape cases,"The Punjab government has decided to set up seven fast-track courts to ensure speedy trial and justice in rape cases. It has also decided to establish three special courts to adjudicate offences against children.

The State cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, met on Thursday and decided to establish 10 more family courts to cover all the districts of the State.

“Cabinet has approved setting up of seven fast-track courts, with the creation of 70 posts to manage them, for dealing exclusively with the rape cases,” the government said in a statement. “Four of these courts will be set up in Ludhiana and one each at Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ferozepur. Seven additional posts of Additional and District Sessions Judges along with 63 supporting staff have been approved,” it added.

The courts, to be set up at an approximate annual expenditure of ₹3.57 crore, will implement the provisions of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018, to deal with the pending rape cases expeditiously. As per the amendment made to Section 173 of the Criminal Procedure Code in 2018, trial of rape cases is to be concluded within two months.

The cabinet also paved the way for setting up a Water Regulation and Development Authority by approving enactment of ‘The Punjab Water Resources (Management and Regulation) Ordinance, 2019’. The ordinance, which was approved by the council of Ministers on December 4, 2019, is now all set to be introduced as the ‘The Punjab Water Resources (Management and Regulation) Bill, 2020’ in the State Assembly, according to the statement.

“The Bill proposes to set up a Punjab Water Regulation and Development Authority, consisting of a Chairman and two other members to be appointed by the government. The Authority will be responsible for management and conservation of water resources of the State in a judicious, equitable and sustainable manner, and will be empowered to take all such measures as it deems necessary or expedient for this purpose,” the government said.

To check delays and speed up implementation of various projects and schemes in the State, the cabinet decided to establish an empowered committee of Ministers, who will have the power to take all necessary decisions relating to the same. Also, to make tourism more disabled-friendly, the cabinet approved the necessary amendments to the Punjab State Culture Policy, 2017, and the Punjab State Tourism Policy 2018, to ensure compliance with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kv6hm2/article30517009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE08-AMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-to-set-up-7-fast-track-courts-to-try-rape-cases/article30524489.ece
247,2020/01/09,"Open to fresh probe in Judge Loya’s death case, says Maharashtra Home Minister","Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday said the State government is open to reinvestigating the death of special CBI judge B.H. Loya if fresh evidence warrants it.

“Our government is open to reinvestigating the Loya death case. Some people are meeting me today to demand that the case be reopened. I will hear them out and if necessary, the case will be reinvestigated,” said Mr. Deshmukh. Asked whom he was meeting, the Minister said he could not divulge the names.

Loya, who was hearing the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case of Gujarat involving current Union Home Minister Amit Shah, died of cardiac arrest in Nagpur on December 1, 2014, when he had gone to attend a wedding. His death turned controversial after news reports suggested foul play.

BJP MLA Ashish Shelar criticised Mr. Deshmukh for his statement. “If the Supreme Court has closed the case, then what is the reason for the Home Minister to make such statements? Is he acting as per law or are political intentions behind this?” he asked.

A Bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra and Justices A.M. Khanwilkar and D.Y. Chandrachud in April 2018 dismissed the petitions demanding independent probe in the Loya death after articles appeared in a magazine raising suspicions about his death in Nagpur in 2014.

“There are reports that the mob had lobbed crude bombs at the police personnel besides pelting them with stones and glass bottles. The force had to resort to firing rubber bullets and bursting of tear gas shells to restore law and order,” Rajoria said.

249,2020/01/09,Assam announces more sops amid anti-CAA protests,"Sops continue to rain in Assam amid the ongoing stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Sarbananda Sonowal’s BJP-led coalition government on Thursday announced a set of sops for children, teachers, health workers and the differently abled. This follows a one-time grant for artists and technicians and land settlement deeds for landless indigenous people in the State.

Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said a one-time financial assistance of ₹1 lakh each would be given to the wards of 700 employees of two dead paper mills, who are pursuing studies in a medical or engineering college or a similar course. The Hindustan Paper Corporation Limited used to run these mills.

“Likewise, ₹75,000 each would be given to those children pursuing post-graduate studies or doing PhD research, ₹50,000 each to those pursuing graduation in colleges or diploma in polytechnics, ₹25,000 to those studying in Standard XI and XII and ₹10,000 to those studying from nursery to class 10,” he told newspersons.

Mr Sarma said the education scheme related to the paper mills, entailing ₹5 crore, would be implemented in February. After applications are submitted online from January 14, the amount would be transferred to the bank accounts of beneficiaries who will be selected following a process of screening by the deputy commissioners (district magistrates) of the two districts where the mills are located.

A week ago, the children of Cachar Paper Mill employees took to the streets with begging bowls, seeking help from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Sonowal.

Mr Sarma also announced a health scheme through which some 50,000 employees under National Health Mission can claim medical reimbursement of up to ₹5 lakh annually from the government. The scheme covers the members of their families too.

“We will extend this health scheme also to 50,000 teachers contracted through TET (Teacher Eligibility Test) as well as the State pool teachers under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in the next two months. The additional teachers or contractual teachers working in government high schools will also be covered under it,” he said.

The third scheme announced on Thursday was for differently abled State government employees. The government would bear 4% of the interest if they avail a bank loan to buy a two-wheeler or a car.

The last fortnight had seen the State government announce ₹50,000 as a one-time grant for some 2,000 artistes and technicians of the State. The government also announced creation of autonomous councils for certain communities and handing over land settlement deeds to some 40,000 indigenous people.

250,2020/01/09,"‘Brutally thrashed and labelled urban naxal’, says theatre actor Deepak Kabir","Theatre actor and cultural activist Deepak Kabir on Thursday alleged that police not only brutally thrashed and abused him in custody but also labelled him an “urban naxal.”

The term ‘urban naxal’, used by right-wing groups and activists and popularised by leaders of the ruling BJP, is evoked to link activists and academicians critical of the government to Naxalites.

Mr. Kabir, 44, was released from the Lucknow district jail after a local court granted him bail in connection with the violence in Lucknow during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on December 19 last.

He was arrested by police on December 20 when he allegedly went to the Hazratganj police station to inquire about the whereabouts of his activist friends who were picked up by police following the protests.

Mr. Kabir told The Hindu that the Hazratganj SHO first snatched his phone, threw off his cap and dubbed him a “mastermind” of the violence. “He said, ‘you are a krantikari [revolutionary], right...’ Mr. Kabir recalled. He said his submission that he had come to the police station on his own will to look for his friends fell on deaf ears.

Following this, around 12-15 policemen escorted him to a hall and took turns to beat him up with batons and their arms and was kicked for at least 10 minutes, Mr. Kabir alleged. “The SHO told them to tie my hands and legs and beat me as much as they can,” he said.

Mr. Kabir said his ordeal did not end there. After getting a medical examination done at a local hospital, he was thrashed again on the orders of a senior police officer, he alleged.

This time, four policemen caught hold of him while a fifth incessantly hit him with a baton, he claimed. “They were told to hit me till they got tired,” Mr. Kabir said.

“He [district police chief] said, beat them so much that they can’t sit for months and make sure there is a 1.5 -2 inch swelling [on their buttocks],” he said.

The policemen also tried to undress him to thrash him but could not after he resisted, he alleged.

‘Communists hairstyle’

Commenting on Mr. Kabir’s dishevelled hair — he keeps his hair long — a police officer told him “such hairstyle is kept by Communists,” he said. “ These are urban naxals, prepare a list [of urban naxals],” Mr. Kabir said, recalling the police officer’s orders to his subordinates.

After spending almost three weeks in police custody and jail, Mr. Kabir, who organises the Kabir Festival, named after the Sufi mystic, every year in Lucknow, is shocked by the police action.

He said, “I can understand them hitting somebody picked up from the scene...they can have a doubt that he or she may be involved in the violence. But the next day, when someone is going to the police station…then we can see what kind of hate and revenge this is.”

He said he became numb and was unable to think due to the physical pain. “I closed my ears and eyes so that I don’t feel anything.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jmhs1w/article30522142.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Deepak-Kabir2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/brutally-thrashed-and-labelled-urban-naxal-theatre-actor-deepak-kabir-recalls-police-brutality-over-caa/article30522134.ece

Ms. Banerjee said her decision was against violence unleashed by the Left and the Congress during the 24-hour general strike on Wednesday. The strike affected normal life and violence was also reported from different parts of the State.

“I won’t attend the meeting convened by Sonia Gandhi as a protest against the Congress-Left hooliganism during Wednesday’s strike,” she said. She said she would fight against the CAA and the NRC alone. She said she had earlier agreed to participate in the meeting but had withdrawn after what the CPI(M) and the Congress has done.

253,2020/01/09,BSF jawan injured in attack on Bangladesh border,"Suspected Bangladesh nationals have attacked a border outpost in Meghalaya, assaulting two BSF jawans and snatching their weapons, resulting in injuries to one of them, police said.

Another group from the neighbouring country barged into the house of a Meghalaya resident and looted money, mobile phones and a gun, besides injuring the head of the family, a senior officer said.

The incidents took place at around midnight on January 8 at Amdoh and Rongtila, which are about five km from the India-Bangladesh border, West Jaintia Hills Superintendent of Police (SP) Lakador Syiem said.

“A group of 10-15 Bangladesh nationals allegedly surrounded two Border Security Force (BSF) personnel near the Rongtila border outpost (BOP), assaulted them and snatched their weapons, causing injuries to one of them,” he said.

The weapons snatched from the BSF personnel were later recovered from a nearby forest, Mr. Syiem said.

Prior to the incident, another Bangladesh group had barged into the house of Pratap Bareh at Amdoh village near the Rongtila BOP and looted money, mobile phones and a gun, he said.

Mr. Bareh had fired a round at the intruders in self- defence before his gun was snatched and he was assaulted, Mr. Syiem said.

Both Mr. Bareh and the injured BSF jawan were taken to Dawki Primary Health Centre (PHC).

The deputy inspector general of police (Eastern Range) met the injured persons and visited the places of occurrence along with the district deputy commissioner and senior officers of the BSF and police.

After the incidents, the BSF lodged a protest against the intrusion of cross-border criminals from Bangladesh during a flag meeting with its counterpart, the Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB).

The BGB has promised to intensify patrolling to ensure that no Bangladeshi national crossed over the international border with India, a senior BSF official said.

The incident comes a week after another group of persons, also suspected to be from Bangladesh, attacked a car at an area 10 km inside India and decamped with money and mobile phones after injuring the occupants.

Meghalaya Education Minister Lahkmen Rymbui, also the local MLA, condemned the incidents.

The body of the LLB student was found hanging from the roof of her room at the family’s home in the Jahagirabad police station area here on Tuesday morning, police said.

The victim’s mother has complained that she was under pressure from the two rape accused and committed suicide.

She alleged that two youth from Semrava village under Kothi police station area, had raped the victim four months ago.

Since one of the accused is a local heavyweight, the police initially did not lodge an FIR but later it was registered on the orders of a court, the mother of the victim claimed, adding that no arrest has been made.

However, Superintendent of Police Akash Tomar said the father of the deceased had told the police in writing that his daughter committed suicide and he had no suspicion on anyone.

256,2020/01/09,‘Errant’ officials: HC pulls up State for inaction,"The Bombay High Court on Wednesday pulled up the Maharashtra government for not taking action against 123 officers who allegedly misappropriated funds allotted for the welfare of the State’s Scheduled Tribes.

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing four public interest litigations (PILs) filed in 2012, one of them by Bahiram Motiram, an adivasi from Nashik.

The PILs allege that various schemes by the State and Central governments meant for the benefit of Scheduled Tribes do not reach them and that huge sums of money have been misappropriated.

The PILs say the provision of 9% is yet to be made in the yearly budget for the Tribal Development Department and the State is yet to establish 24 project offices in tribal areas to implement the schemes.

On April 15, 2014, the HC had appointed retired Justice M.G. Gaikwad to conduct an inquiry into corruption in the department.

On January 31, 2017, he filed a report that said criminal prosecution and departmental inquiries should be initiated against 123 errant officers and staff members.

As per the HC’s directions, Manisha Verma, principal secretary of Tribal Development Department, filed an affidavit that reads, “No official of [the department] has been arrested and placed under police custody for more than 48 hours and hence, the question of suspending any official does not arise.” The 14-page affidavit also said, “None of the officials who were officiating the posts where irregularities have taken place are currently working in the same posts (sic).”

The court, however, said, “All this is just eyewash. Does the principal secretary seriously want us to accept such an affidavit where she is saying she is unable to get information from the police? If the police were not forthcoming with the information, then what stopped the principal secretary from raising the issue with the State Home Department?

257,2020/01/09,Jolt for BJP in Vidarbha as party loses Nagpur ZP polls,"While it registered an emphatic win in the Dhule zilla parishad election, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) efforts in its stronghold of Vidarbha largely came a cropper as the party lost the crucial Nagpur zilla parishad. The party drew even with the Congress in the Nandurbar ZP.

Results of the polls to six zilla parishads — Washim, Akola, Palghar, Dhule, Nagpur and Nandurbar — were declared on Wednesday. Besides Dhule, the BJP failed to make any gains in the other five ZPs.

In the 58-seat Nagpur ZP, the BJP could manage to secure only 15 seats, with the Congress snaring 31 seats and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) 10.

Loss in Gadkari’s village

Humiliatingly, the BJP lost the ZP seat in Dhapewada, the village of Union Minister Nitin Gadkari. Likewise, a Congress candidate defeated the BJP nominee in the Koradi Circle ZP seat in former Nagpur guardian minister and senior BJP leader Chandrashekhar Bawankule’s hometown.

While not quite the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) formula, the Congress fought the Nagpur ZP in alliance with the NCP and the Peasants and Workers’ Party, which won a single seat. The Shiv Sena, which contested on its own, could only manage a single seat as well.

The ZP results indicated that the BJP had yet to rally from its setback in Vidarbha, where it lost 17 seats in the Assembly polls despite the region being considered the party’s bastion.

“The BJP had been in power for seven years in the Nagpur ZP. During this period, it had not carried out any development work in the rural areas,” said State Home Minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh, whose son Salil won the Metpanjra panchayat samiti seat.

Likewise, former NCP minister Ramesh Bang’s son, Dinesh, won the Hingna panchayat samiti seat.

Top brass absent

According to observers, the reason for the BJP’s defeat in Nagpur is that besides former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, none of the top party brass, including Mr. Bawankule, were seen campaigning hard enough.

In Nandurbar, Mr. Fadnavis’s campaign paid off, with the BJP bagging 23 seats in the 56-seat ZP. There was no MVA coalition in Nandurbar as the Congress, NCP and Sena fought separately. The Congress, too, managed to win 23 seats, while the Sena won seven and the NCP three.

Sources said an MVA formula is most likely to come into play here in the coming days, as the Sena has emerged ‘kingmaker’.

The Sena dealt a big blow to Tribal Affairs Minister and seven-time Nandurbar MLA K.C. Padavi of the Congress. Mr. Padavi’s wife, Hemlata, was beaten by the Sena’s Ganesh Paradke.

The BJP effortlessly won the 56-seat Dhule ZP as the collective leadership of Dhule MP Dr. Subhash Bhamre and party leader Jaykumar Rawal paid off. “The BJP has helped bring a number of irrigation projects to the rural areas, and the public has recognised the party’s efforts,” Dr. Bhamre said.

Mr. Rawal said the MVA was an “opportunistic alliance” and not the people’s true mandate. “The people of Maharashtra have comprehensively rejected this unnatural alliance, and this sentiment has been reflected in the results in the Dhule ZP where, for the first time, [the BJP] has secured more than 35 seats,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9g8hto/article30518536.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BMNAGPURZP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jolt-for-bjp-in-vidarbha-as-party-loses-nagpur-zp-polls/article30518537.ece
258,2020/01/09,Task force of experts to help State reduce debt burden,"The State government will set up a task force of experts from the financial and banking sectors to find a way out of its ballooning debt.

Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Finance and Planning Ajit Pawar has issued directives to set up a financial action task force of private experts, which would submit a report for the road ahead, keeping in mind the ₹4.72 lakh crore debt burden on the State.

In his first review meet of the department, the Finance Minister said the State will have to accelerate growth in four key areas: tourism, port, education and services, officials said. “The Deputy Chief Minister has asked us to prepare a note on the task force, which will have many global and Indian experts on board,” said a senior official of the finance department.

Overall, the State’s debt burned in 2011-12 was ₹2,25,976 crore, which increased to ₹2,94,261 crore by 2014-15. It further increased to ₹4,02,421 crore in 2017-18. The revised estimates of 2018-19 are at ₹4,14,411 crore and the budgetary estimates for 2019-20 are ₹4,71,642 crore, claims a report tabled before the Finance Minister.

The report further said another ₹2 lakh crore remain off books as recorded extra budgetary borrowing. “The State has no other option but to explore new sectors for growth. The task force will immediately suggest measures to reduce the debt,” said an official.

The State government has already given guarantees on loans of ₹25,134.86 crore taken to complete major infrastructure projects. These include the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway and Metro 4. The State also incurs subsidies of ₹22,136 crore on various schemes.

All of these have to be rationalised going into the future, the minister said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5hho1i/article30487491.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05TH-THGRP-PAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/task-force-of-experts-to-help-state-reduce-debt-burden/article30518485.ece
259,2020/01/09,Bandh hits normal life in Bengal,"Normal life was affected in West Bengal on Wednesday as the 24-hour all-India strike called by trade unions affected rail and road transport services in the State.

In certain places, including Kolkata, the situation turned violent with the Congress and the Left activists attacking buses and clashing with the police.

Crude bombs found

Suburban railway services were also affected due to the strike as protesters obstructed tracks and covered railway overhead wires with banana leaves. At Barasat in North 24 Parganas, three crude bombs were retrieved from under the railway tracks and attempts were made to shut down the ticket counter of metro railway at Dum Dum.

The situation turned volatile at Jadavpur area of Kolkata when Communist Party of India (Marxist) MLA Sujan Chakraborty was taken into custody by the police. In Sujapur in Malda district, bandh supporters clashed with the police. Some videos showed that police resorted to baton charge. The Left and the Congress leadership alleged that the police attacked private vehicles and destroyed private property in Sujapur.

Banking services were also affected. At most places, ATM kiosks were either closed or the machines had run out of cash. The only exception was the State government employees who attended office in large numbers as the government had issued notification stating that an absence would result not only in loss of pay but also break in the service.

‘It is hooliganism’

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said that those trying to enforce the bandh are looking for “cheap publicity”. “Police will take strong action wherever required. I still appeal to them to go for democratic protests,” she said.

“What is happening is not protest, it is dadagiri (hooliganism). I condemn it… I support the issues, but there are other ways like peaceful agitation. We will not allow anyone to forcibly enforce bandhs in Bengal. We have not allowed it now, and we will not allow it [in the future],” she said.

CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Md. Salim and State Congress president Somen Mitra both maintained that the bandh was a huge success.

Both alleged that it was after Ms. Banerjee’s directive that the police swung into action and destroyed public property in Sujapur.

“The Trinamool police in Malda behaved exactly like Yogi Adityanath’s police in Uttar Pradesh. Inspired by U.P. police and instigated by the Chief Minister, the police destroyed private property at Sujapur,” Mr. Salim claimed.

He added that the strike was against the Narendra Modi government and by making attempts to foil the bandh, Ms. Banerjee has made it clear on whose side she is.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/w47b69/article30518273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09DESERTED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bandh-hits-normal-life-in-bengal/article30518274.ece

Several political parties, including the Left and the Congress, extended open support to the strike. The Biju Janata Dal did not support the strike. No untoward incident was reported from any part of the State during the day.

Holding placards and banners against the Centre’s “anti-labour policies”, hundreds of enforcers of the strike belonging to different trade unions and political parties blocked rail tracks and highways. The strike supporters were taken into custody at many places.

Commuters and tourists had a difficult time as private buses remained off the roads and trains were halted at various stations. Many trains that suffered delays in the morning hours resumed journey later in the day.

Commercial establishments and banks remained closed with the employees taking part in the strike.

Almost all educational institutions remained closed during the day and examinations were postponed in many institutions including the Utkal University.

261,2020/01/09,Arunachal to fight in SC against citizenship for refugees: CM,"The Arunachal Pradesh government will fight a legal battle in the Supreme Court “with all preparation” so that the 73,000-odd Chakma and Hajong refugees living in the State do not get citizenship with the help of the amended Citizenship Act, the Assembly was informed on Wednesday.

Chakma and Hajong refugees came from erstwhile East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, five decades ago.

The Supreme Court had directed the Centre in 2015 that they are accorded Indian citizenship.

Several organisations in the State have been opposing the idea of granting citizenship to them saying it would change its demography.

The State government had filed a review petition on October 26, 2015, against the apex court’s judgment but it was rejected, Chief Minister Pema Khandu said during the Question Hour.

Responding to a query from Congress MLAs Nabam Tuki and Wanglin Lowangdong, he also said the State government then filed a Special Leave Petition on September 14, 2016, which was admitted by the Supreme Court and the hearing is awaited.

Mr. Khandu said, following another SC verdict of 1996, the State government has been providing basic amenities to the refugees living in Changlang, Namsai and Papumpare districts.

Asked by Mr. Lowangdong about the possibility of the refugees moving the SC claiming themselves as the natives of the State, Mr. Khandu said the government will fight the case “with all preparation”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/arunachal-to-fight-in-sc-against-citizenship-for-refugees-cm/article30518214.ece
262,2020/01/09,"‘Salaries, bonuses not being given to employees on time’","Hundreds of workers protested under the banner of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) in Sahibabad Industrial Area here to protest against the “anti-labour policies” of the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government.

“The Yogi Adityanath government tried to terrorise the workers by wielding Section 144, but by turning out in large numbers in inclement weather in Ghaziabad and Noida, the workers have shown they are united against the anti-labour polices of the BJP,” said Anurag Saxena, general secretary of CITU’s Delhi-NCR unit.

He said the government was pro-rich as it had cut corporate tax, but wages and bonus of poor workers were not being given on time. “There has been no change in the profits of the Ambanis and Adanis but the poor are suffering due to high inflation... the new labour code is going to make their lives more miserable,” he added.

Citing the recent fire incident in Delhi’s Sadar Bazaar where dozens of workers died, Mr. Saxena said the workers were employed like “bonded-labourers with no fire exit”. “Is this how ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ would be achieved?” he said.

While demanding an end to contractorisation in permanent work, and payment of same wage and benefits for contract and regular workers, Mr. Saxena added that the amended Citizenship Act and the National Register of Citizens were ways to drive “a wedge between workers along religious lines... but it will not work”.

“The JNU incident [on January 5, when masked attackers beat up students on campus] is a way to divert attention from real issues and the BJP will get a resounding response from the grassroots,” he said

In front of Indure Private Limited in Site IV, Sahibabad, the workers complained about non-payment of salary for three months and provident fund not being deposited. “The production is going on in full swing, but when we ask for salaries, safety gear and medical facilities, we are told that the company has suffered a lot during demonetisation and that is why they cannot pay wages on time,” said Pradeep Kumar, president of a workers’ union.

“There are 90 permanent and 200 casual workers. It seems the company wants the job of permanent nature to be done by casual labour.

263,2020/01/09,Bangladeshi criminals attack border outpost; one BSF jawan hurt: Police,"A group of criminals, allegedly from Bangladesh, attacked a BSF border outpost on Wednesday and snatched the weapons of two armed guards, while another group robbed a family of money and a gun, besides assaulting the head of the family, police said.

The incidents took place at around midnight at Amdoh and Rongtila, which are about five kilometres from the Indo-Bangladesh border, they said.

A group of 10-15 Bangladeshi nationals allegedly gheraoed two Border Security Force (BSF) personnel near the Rongtila Border Outpost (BOP), assaulted them and snatched their weapons, resulting in injuries to one of them, West Jaintia Hills Superintendent of Police (SP) Lakador Syiem said.

The weapons snatched from the BSF personnel were recovered from a nearby jungle, he added.

The incident took place at around 12:30 am and prior to it, at around midnight, another group of Bangladeshi nationals forcibly entered the house of Pratap Bareh at Amdoh village, near the Rongtila BOP, looted cash, mobile phones and an SBBL gun, the SP said.

Mr. Bareh fired a round at the intruders in self-defence, before the gun was snatched from him and he was assaulted, Syiem said, adding that both Bareh and the injured BSF personnel were taken to the Dawki Primary Health Centre (PHC) for treatment.

The Deputy Inspector General of Police (Eastern Range) visited the affected persons and the places of occurrence to take stock of the situation, along with the district deputy commissioner and all senior officials of the police and the BSF.

Earlier in the day, the BSF lodged a protest against the intrusion of cross border criminals from Bangladesh during a flag meeting with its counterpart, Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB).

The BGB promised to intensify patrolling to ensure that no Bangladeshi criminal crossed over the international pillars and created a law-and-order situation at the border, a senior BSF official said.

Last week, a group of criminals, also suspected to be from Bangladesh, attacked a car at a spot located about 10 km inside India, injuring the occupants, and fled with their money and mobile phones.

Meghalaya Education Minister Lahkmen Rymbui, who is also the local MLA, condemned the incidents.

264,2020/01/09,An Olympic First: Cardboard beds for Tokyo Athletes Village,"Tokyo Olympic athletes beware — particularly larger ones.

The bed frames in the Athletes Village at this year’s Olympics will be made of cardboard. Sturdy cardboard.

“Those beds can stand up to 200 kilograms,” explained Takashi Kitajima, the general manager of the Athletes Village, speaking through an interpreter.

That’s about 440 pounds, and surely no Olympic athlete weighs that much.

“They are stronger than wooden beds,” Kitajima added.

He also took into account the possibility of a wild room celebration after, say, a gold-medal victory.

“Of course, wood and cardboard would each break if you jumped on them,” he said.

The single bed frames will be recycled into paper products after the games. The mattress components — the mattresses are not made of cardboard — will be recycled into plastic products.

The mattress is broken up into three distinct sections, and the firmness of each can be adjusted.

The idea was to use materials that could be remade after the Olympics and Paralympics. But the cardboard frames and supports should give the rooms a spartan look.

Organisers showed off the beds and a few other furnishings on Thursday at their headquarters. The entire Athletes Village complex will be completed in June. The Olympics open on July 24 followed by the Paralympics on Aug. 25.

“The organising committee was thinking about recyclable items, and the bed was one of the ideas,” Kitajima explained, crediting local Olympic sponsor Airweave Inc. for the execution.

Organisers say this is the first time that the beds and bedding in the Athletes Village have been made of renewable materials.

The Athletes Village being built alongside Tokyo Bay will comprise 18,000 beds for the Olympics and be composed to 21 apartment towers. Even more building construction is being planned in the next several years.

Real estate ads say the units will be sold off afterward, or rented, with sale prices starting from about 54 million yen — or about $500,000 — and soaring to three or four times that much. Some fear the apartments will flood the market, possibly impacting property values.

The units will be sold off by various real estate companies. Ads suggest many of the units will be slightly larger than a typical apartment in Tokyo, which is about 60-70 square meters — or 650-750 square feet.",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/dgfb76/article30521937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OLYMPICSTOKYOCARDBOARDBEDS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/an-olympic-first-cardboard-beds-for-tokyo-athletes-village/article30521938.ece
265,2020/01/09,The why and how of Bharatanatyam,"Only a year away from its 40th edition, this year’s Natya Kala Conference convened by senior dancer-choreographer Rama Vaidyanathan, was held at the Krishna Gana Sabha from December 26 to 30. Titled ‘Nirikshana: Bharatanatyam under the magnifying glass’, the conference set out to explore the dance form and address some of the issues.

Here are snippets of selected sessions over the five days of the conference:

Day one witnessed visible excitement over the first session, hosting Dr. Padma Subrahmanyam, Sudharani Raghupathy and Chitra Visweswaran, titled ‘Dance Buddies: Re-visiting the Kuravanji Story.’ The film began with a shot of Sudharani Raghupathy. As it played out, the audience relived a slice of 1987 with Doordarshan’s (DD) recording of Viralimalai Kuruvanji, an abridged version. The success of the episode took them to the Festival of India in the USSR and Middle East. This was followed by re-creation of the piece by the trio that met with rousing applause and loud cheers. Although the hooting audience was a new addition to the Chennai dance scene, the session was an eye-opener in how improvisation in performance comes with experience.

‘Alarippu Adventures’ with Christopher Gurusamy, Harinie Jeevitha, Radhe Jaggi and Preethi Ramprasad explored different interpretations of alarippu. The navarasa, temple structures, garuda and the joy of playing games were all uniquely woven into khanda triputa, khanda ata, misra jhampa and chatusra dhruva talams, composed by Ramamoorthy Sriganesh. At the end, a demonstration in group dynamics to a chatusra alarippu explored interesting formations and convergence of styles. This experiment in choreography and creativity, represented a celebration of the new dimensions the upcoming generation of dancers bring to the table.

The possibilities of building tension in a room are aplenty. There was enough to debate and deliberate upon in ‘Arangetram: A Boon or a Bane’. It is to be noted that none of the gurus were opposed to the concept of the arangetram itself. A genuine concern among young dancers, with respect to opportunities and the economics of performance, were reflected in this session. Moderated by Chitra Visweswaran, this session delved into how arangetrams are being used as a social status showcase, the rising exclusivity through expensive arangetrams and navigating the Guru-Sishya parampara over these issues. Some in the panel reflected upon involvement and commitment students exhibit for the arangetram. “(Children) rise to the occassion. They must, they have no choice but to,” quipped Leela Samson. “However, one does question its purpose if it is only a one-off performance-based involvement. If dancers are not motivated by the love for dance, what is really the point?”

Another concern with arangetrams is the presentation of a detailed repertoire without the theoretical knowledge or movement vocabulary. While traditionally teachers are expected to decide if the student is ready for an arangetram, the litmus test in honesty and parents’ insistence are an open secret. Sheela Unnikrishnan mentioned that it is up to the student’s family to choose how lavishly to conduct the event. Samson said, in particular to the young dancers, “What is the choice you’re making to spend this amount of money?”

Whether the takeaway from this session would lead to more temple performances, crowdfunded arangetrams or a conscious economic cap for arangetrams need to be seen.

Evolution of the art

‘Of Bharatanatyam Then & Now: Tracing changes in its content and performance’ by Rajika Puri on the Third Day was an insightful presentation with visuals, studied observations and wit. A crash course or a refresher depending on your acquaintance with the dance form, Rajika also put forth questions to ruminate upon. An interesting point she made was that until the 90s, students largely learnt from male teachers. While students copied their movements, they did not copy their style. “Today, there’s the danger that students might become clones of their gurus, who are themselves performers and have their own styles,” she said. Focusing on stylistic changes, influence of learned proponents of other dance forms, changes in the margam and reworking the pieces, she drew a comprehensive picture of Bharatanatyam’s evolution over a century.

The discussion on emerging trends in new-age training explored learning over Skype, workshops in regions with less access to culture, masterclasses in abhinaya, classes for students unfamiliar with the framework of the art form and gurukul-based workshops for a specific period of time. Important takeaways from this session were the emphasis on artistic expressions of different schools, the exposure to diversity that masterclasses and workshops offer a dancer and creating platforms to share knowledge among the dance community.

The 39th Natya Kala Conference was overall a confluence of knowledge, performances and some of dance community’s legends. Over the course of five days, the sessions covered a variety of topics, however, one wonders if popularity tended to cloud relevance. Nonetheless, Nirikshana laid the foundation of what it set out to address.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/xgtc7a/article30522749.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10frTrioJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/the-why-and-how-of-bharatanatyam/article30522750.ece
266,2020/01/09,A stage to perform,"Getting to know the stage and the audience can prove a challenge for any performer as stages are hard to find.

The annual Rangaparichaya Festival organised by Natanakaisiki Mohiniyattam Gurukulam, Irinjalakuda attains relevance in this context. The Rangaparichaya Festival gives the Mohiniyattam students of Guru Nirmala Paniker at Natanakaisiki, a much-needed space to perform.

Mother of Mohiniyattam, a documentary on Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma, directed by Vinod Mankara, and produced by Smitha Rajan, was screened during the inaugural session.

The inaugural session was followed by a Mohiniyattam recital by Sandra Pisharody. After ‘Chithrangada,’ the choreography of the famed work of Ravindranatha Tagore’s by Nirmala, Sandra presented one of her new productions – that of a portion of the Kathakali padam from Duryodhanavadham. The subtleness with which she approached the lyrics from the Attakkatha was remarkable. ‘Sangameswara Mangalam’, which was also choreographed by Sandra, paying obeisance to the deity of Sangameswara or Koodalmanikyam, the deity at the Sree Koodalmanikyam Temple at Irinjalakjuda, was again proof of her prowess as a choreographer.

The festival concluded the next day with performances by all the students of Natanakaisiki. Beginning with a Cholkettu in Ragamalika and Adi talam choreographed by Nirmala, the students moved onto a Jathiswaram in Chenchurutty ragam and Adi tala, which was one of the oldest compositions in Mohiniyattam, following which the younger students of Natanakaisiki presented a Krishna sthuthi (‘Krishna Mukunda Murare…’). Anju Peter, a senior student presented a padam detailing the Peacock Dance and ending with ‘Kaliyamardanam’. After the thillana in Bhoopalam and Adi talam, the students also presented the Desi compositions of Mohiniyattam including Poli, Chandanam and Kurathi, which were revived by Nirmala.

Vocal support was provided by Neelamperoor Sureshkumar with Kalanilayam Prakasan on the maddalam, Murali Krishnan on the veena, Kalanilayam Ramakrishnan on the edakka and Meenakshy Menon and Sandra Pisharody on the nattuvangam.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/gw2a6k/article30512832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TVFSANDRA1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/sandra-pisharodys-mohiniyattam-recital-showcased-her-prowess-as-a-dancer-and-choreographer/article30512833.ece
267,2020/01/09,Beyond boundaries,"A calm December evening was filled with the rapid beats of the mizhavu when 20 theatre students from the National School of Drama (NSD), Varanasi performed Kailasodharanam, one of Koodiyattam’s more challenging plays. The play was the culmination of their 25-day familiarisation workshop with Koodiyattam, the 2,000-year-old Sanskrit classical theatre.

The workshop was structured in a manner that allowed the participants to understand the art form through class room training as well as stage performances. The classroom training sessions were conducted by renowned Koodiyattam artistes such as Margi Sajeev Narayana Chakyar, Margi Madhu, Sooraj Nambiar, Kalamandalam Krishnendu and Kalamandalam Sajikumar.

The workshop covered aspects that included basic body movements, eye movements, hasta mudras and also the percussion part of Koodiyattam. Lectures by exponents such as KG Poulose and Ettumanoor P Kannan helped the participants understand the history and aesthetics of this age old art form.

The participants also witnessed a few Koodiyattam performances during their stay in the capital city.

Each participant performed a small portion of Kailasodharanam, which was evaluated by the trainers on the last day of the workshop.

“The decision of the National School of Drama, Varanasi to bring their students to Kerala to study Koodiyattam is laudable. The participants got the opportunity to see the art form in its original cultural background and learn a little about Koodiyattam. I am sure the students will use this experience in their future creative theatre activities,” said Kannan, director of SNA Kutiyattam Kendra.

The involvement of the participants was earnest. They went through the rigorous training process with great enthusiasm and involvement.

Gaurav Singh, a participant, hopes to polish his Koodiyattam skills further. According to him, 25 days were insufficient to learn the art form. He hopes to return and learn more about Koodiyattam.

Shree Ram Ji Bali, centre director, NSD Varanasi, who led the group, felt that a familiarisation with Koodiyattam is a must for all modern theatre actors. He believes that many of the methods deployed in modern theatre are present in this classical theatre. While it is a stylised form of acting, it also follows an internal approach, where the character grows within the actor.

268,2020/01/09,The accent of this dance was on movement,"When an artiste, proficient in both yoga and dance, performs, the result is an alluring union of both. As one witnessed when Vyshnavie Sainath performed for the Narada Gana Sabha. She presented ‘Vinodham — The Story of A Sculptor,’ an adaptation from ‘Metamorphosis,’ the Greek play about Pygmalion and Galatea. It tells of a famous sculptor, who falls in love with his own creation.

At the behest of the king, the sculptor carves a sculpture of a woman. Made of ivory, it is so beautiful and perfect, he falls in love with it and ‘she’ comes alive to fulfil the desires of her creator. The narration of course has lessons and layers of interpretation typical of Greek drama.

Vyshanavie is multifaceted as she is also a scholarship holder from Goldman Sachs for Woman Entrepreneurship at IIM (Bangalore) and the only student who received it for Performing Arts (Dance) and is also in the process of doing her Ph.D. in dance. And the fact that she is a yoga instructor came in handy for a these such as this with poses, stances and postures that showed her skill and agility when it comes to implementing difficult asanas especially when incorporated into the dance format.

Tall and stately, Vyshnavie began her performance with a poem in praise of Siva. Executed with clean footwork, the piece, choreographed by Rajeswari Sainath, involved the cosmic dance and the power of Siva, giving Vyshnavie the scope to showcase the dynamics of movement interwoven with difficult asanas. Siva is Adiyogi, and the dependence on the yoga element seemed apt. Percussion (mridangam and tabla) set the mood to the ragamalika, lyric for which was by Su Ravi. The concept was by maestro Karaikudi Mani.

The focus of ‘Vinodham’ was on the way the sculptor worked on his sculpture, choreographed to highlight the dancer’s grip over laya and the ability to strike statuesque postures. Music was a strength of the production, Rajkumar Bharati giving it the right amount of drama and poignancy. Lyrics were by Kavi Kannan and the rhythmic jathis were by Karaikkudi Mani.

Much thought had gone into the costume — for instance, a simple change of the fan in front for different elements and moods enhanced the visual appeal. The dancer used several yards of blue fabric to invoke a bird taking wing. Also the use of panels with orange accentuated the lovely blue of the costume.

Providing excellent support on the vocal was Gomathi Nayagam. Karra Srinivas did the nattuvangam. The orchestra had Nagai Narayanan (mridangam) Sruthi Sagar (flute) and Kalaiarasan (violin). With lighting arrangements by Venkatesh, the short but intense production got its own brand of creativity!",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/tspwd0/article30522434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FRVYSHNAVIE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/the-accent-in-this-dance-was-on-movement/article30522435.ece

270,2020/01/09,Court accepts CBI’s closure report in DSP Vishnupriya case,"The Chief Judicial Magistrate Court in Coimbatore, handling cases of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), on Thursday accepted the second closure report filed by the agency on its investigation into the death of former Tiruchengode Deputy Superintendent of Police R. Vishnupriya, which said that it was a case of suicide and there was no act of abetment involved.

CJM A.S. Ravi also dismissed the petition filed by the parents of Vishnupriya challenging the second closure report in November 2019.

The CBI had submitted its fist report seeking closure of the case in May 2018 stating that the DSP had ended her life.

Vishnupriya's parents M. Ravi and B. Kalaiselvi filed a petition challenging the report, stating that it had several contradictions and the CBI had merely reproduced the report filed by CB-CID, which had previously investigated the case.

Accepting the petition and dismissing the closure report, the court in December 2018 ordered the CBI to continue the investigation. The agency submitted its report on August 28, 2019 again seeking closure of the case, stating it was a case of suicide.

However, the deceased officer's parents submitted a petition on November 7, 2019 objecting the report.

They argued that the CBI failed to comply with certain conditions put forward by the court when it ordered the agency to continue the investigation after dismissing the first report.

The proceedings in the case concluded on January 7 with the court examining the DSP's parents and five police officers -- two DSPs, an Assistant Commissioner of Police, an Assistant Superintendent of Police and an Inspector -- under Section 164 of Cr.PC.

Defence counsel P.R. Arulmozhi said that the parents would now have to move a Sessions Court or the High Court to seek a revision of the CJM court's order.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/court-accepts-cbis-closure-report-in-dsp-vishnupriya-case/article30527380.ece

CA is pushing for it and knows it can’t happen without BCCI support,” revealed an insider.

The BCCI hierarchy, meanwhile, has kept its cards close to its chest and the matter will most probably boil down to Ganguly’s views on the issue.

Don’t mess with Tests

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka head coach Mickey Arthur has urged that the fabric of Test cricket should not be messed with.

“Test cricket challenges you mentally, physically and technically and a lot of the time on the fifth day (a result comes). We just witnessed a very good Test match (England versus South Africa) that finished on day five,” Arthur said on the eve of the third T20I against India here.

“We can talk about financial pressures (for smaller teams). I think the fabric of Test cricket should not be messed with. You want wickets deteriorating on day five, you want (situations) where there is lot of really good exciting draws. I definitely think five-day Test cricket is the way to go, without doubt,” he said.

Kuldeep’s take

Kuldeep Yadav reiterated captain Kohli’s stand. “To be very honest, I prefer five-day Test cricket. Test cricket is made for five days and I would not like to see any changes to it. Something that is classic should remain classic,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ca-bcci-to-discuss-four-day-test-proposal/article30526290.ece
288,2020/01/09,I’d love to carry on as long as possible: Gayle,"The big-hitting Chris Gayle has said he would “love to carry on as long as possible” in competitive cricket as he is still passionate about the game.

Having taken a break from the game towards the end of 2019, the Jamaican is back in action with the Chattogram Challengers in the Bangladesh Premier League.

“A lot of people still want (to) see Chris Gayle out there in the middle. I still have that love for the game and that passion as well. And I would love to carry on as long as possible,” Gayle said.

The 40-year-old swashbuckler added, “Even in franchise cricket I am still playing a few games here and there around the globe because I still feel I have a lot to offer.

“The body is feeling good. And I am sure I am getting younger as days go on.”

When asked how long he would like to continue, Gayle, on a lighter note, said, “Forty-five is a good number. Yeah, we can target 45.

289,2020/01/09,Catching the boundary-line rule right,"A two-man catch to dismiss Hobart skipper Matthew Wade in a T20 Big Bash match in Brisbane has led to confusion over the laws with even Lord’s weighing in.

Hobart batted first and had limped to 98 for five off 14.4 overs, largely thanks to a captain’s knock by Wade.

On 61, he launched the ball high to the long-on boundary.

Brisbane’s Matt Renshaw, fielding just inside the ropes, leapt and parried the ball into the air as he fell backwards. He landed off the field and then jumped to slap the falling ball back over the ropes to Tom Banton, running round from deep mid-wicket, who caught the pass.

After a long video review, the third umpire decided that Wade, who had already walked off, was given out.

“I had no idea of the rule really — once he hit outside the field of play I didn’t know if he was allowed to touch the ball or not,” Wade told match broadcaster Channel 7.

“Umpires said he was, and once they told me he was allowed to (go) outside the field of play and tap it back in, I knew I was out.”

The 2017 update to the laws included a provision for boundaries and “airborne fielders”.

Lord’s, home of the MCC who act as cricket’s rule makers, tweeted that “Under Law 19.5, the catch is deemed lawful.”

The law says: “A boundary will also be given if a fielder in contact with the ball makes contact with any object grounded beyond the boundary, including another fielder.”

The Lord’s tweet said that “the key moment is when he first touches the ball, which is inside the boundary. He’s airborne for his second contact. Amazing catch.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/catching-the-boundary-line-rule-right/article30526079.ece
290,2020/01/09,Indrajith back in business,"The last seven months have tested B. Indrajith’s resolve. He led the Tamil Nadu Ranji team in 2018-19 and then ran into a roadblock in the form of a shoulder injury.

Now, after a miscommunication between the physio and the doctor had been cleared — Indrajith was initially left out of the squad for the Ranji games against Mumbai and Railways that was announced on Wednesday — the fleet-footed middle-order batsman has been drafted into the Tamil Nadu side for both the games.

The match against Mumbai, the side arrived here on Thursday, begins on January 11.

Technique and composure

Indrajith brings with him technique, solidity and composure at No. 4. Despite the pressures of captaincy, he was the highest scorer for the State in the Ranji Trophy last year with 641 runs at 58.27; this included two hundreds and four fifties. He also notched up a hundred in the Duleep Trophy.

Talking to The Hindu, Indrajith said, “The last competitive cricket I played was the TNCA first division league final. After that I travelled to England to have my shoulder assessed. I underwent surgery there in June for a labrum tear on my right shoulder.”

The period that followed was demanding. “Missing all the cricket during this phase was hard. I had to keep myself focussed.”

Before he was selected for the Ranji Trophy this season, Indrajith played a couple of practice matches to assess his fitness. “I was happy with my shoulder,” he said.

Brilliant catcher

Apart from being one of the best young players of spin in the country, Indrajith is a brilliant catcher close to the wicket.

State selection panel chief M. Senthilnathan said, “Indrajith definitely brings quality to the side. If you look at his career, he has often delivered for the team in crunch situations. Once we got the fitness report, he was an automatic choice.”

Indrajith realised Tamil Nadu’s path this season, after a rocky start, was tough. He said, “Rather than think about qualification, I think we should focus on the kind of cricket we play. The process is more important. The results with come.”

He went on, “We have to first concentrate on the Mumbai game. We have to take it match by match.”

After spending time in the shadows, Indrajith is back in business.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nsg2i2/article30525256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10INDRA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indrajith-back-in-business/article30525257.ece
291,2020/01/09,To test bench strength or not? India face selection dilemma ahead of third T20,"To go with a winning combination or give much needed game time to Sanju Samson and Manish Pandey? That is the dilemma India are facing ahead of the third and final T20 against Sri Lanka here on Friday.

An inexperienced Sri Lanka was no match for India in Indore and considering that, a case could be made for the inclusion of Pandey and Samson.

Pandey has played just one in the last three series, including the current one, while Samson is yet to get a game since he made a comeback with the Bangladesh series in November.

India have been experimenting ahead of the T20 World Cup in October-November but these two players are yet to be tested.

On the other hand, the absence of senior pacers has opened the doors for Shardul Thakur and Navdeep Saini to make an impression, which they did in the previous game by sharing five wickets among themselves.

Washington Sundar and Shivam Dube, who took the injured Hardik Pandya’s place, have got significant opportunities to show what they are capable of.

After the win in Indore, skipper Virat Kohli spoke on how his team is getting better with each passing game.

Most of the players select themselves while he hinted that someone like a Prasidh Krishna could be the surprise package he is looking for the mega event in Australia.

Samson and Pandey must be a tad frustrated to sit out game after game but Friday could be their day. However, what can also not be discounted is the fact that the team management will pick the eleven with the sole aim of winning the series.

Focus will also be on Shikhar Dhawan, who is competing for the second opener’s slot alongside K.L. Rahul. At the moment, Rahul seems ahead in the race to partner Rohit Sharma in Australia.

Jasprit Bumrah did not have the best of outings in his comeback game on Tuesday and he will be raring to go full tilt in the final game.

If he gets to bat, Dube will have do something spectacular to retain his place in side after Pandya returns to action.

Thakur and Saini were impressive in Indore. Thakur was brilliant in the death overs while Saini rattled the batsmen with pace and bounce.

With Sri Lanka having several left-handers, spinners Kuldeep Yadav (2-38) and Washington Sundar (1-29) are likely well retain their place, which effectively means that Ravindra Jadeja and Yuzvendra Chahal will have to sit out.

Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have a lot to work on if they are to trouble the home team. The batsmen will have to make it count after getting starts, which they were not able to do in the second T20.

All-rounder Isuru Udana being ruled out of the game is also a setback. Their main bowler, as put by skipper Lasith Malinga, did not bowl in Indore after injuring himself during warm-up.

The Sri Lankans can definitely do with some experience in the batting department.

Angelo Matthews, who has made a T20 comeback after 16 months, was not picked for the second game in a row. But he could be in the eleven on Friday.

“After that batting performance, everybody has a chance of playing,” said coach Mickey Arthur following the seven wicket loss.

Squads:

India: Virat Kohli (c), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Navdeep Saini, Shardul Thakur, Manish Pandey, Washington Sundar, Sanju Samson.

Sri Lanka: Lasith Malinga (c), D Gunathilaka, A Fernando, A Mathews, D Shanaka, K Perera, N Dickwella, Dhananjaya De Silva, I Udana, B Rajapaksa, O Fernando, W Hasaranga, L Kumara, K Mendis, L Sandakan, K Rajitha.

292,2020/01/09,England's Anderson ruled out of South Africa series with rib injury,"England fast bowler James Anderson has been ruled out of the final two tests of the four-match series against South Africa due to a rib injury as the cursed tour claimed another victim.

Anderson sustained a rib injury in England's 189-run win in the second test at Newlands and underwent an MRI scan in Cape Town.

“England seamer James Anderson has been ruled out of the remainder of the Test series against South Africa,” the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Wednesday.

It is the latest in a number of setbacks for England who despite the mishaps levelled the series with a thrilling victory on Tuesday.

Opener Rory Burns underwent surgery in London this week after he injured his ankle in a soccer kickabout on the eve of the second test.

Jofra Archer also missed the Cape Town match because of an elbow injury, although scans have since cleared him to play in the rest of the tour.

About 10 players and more support staff were laid low by a mystery virus that swept through the squad before the first test in Pretoria.

England all-rounder Ben Stokes has labelled the tour as cursed. His father suffered a stroke days after arriving in the country to watch his son and remains in hospital in Johannesburg.

Anderson, England's leading test wicket-taker, returned to the side following a lengthy layoff due to a calf injury last year, claiming five wickets in the first innings at Cape Town and two in the second before pulling up injured.

293,2020/01/09,"Ball wasn’t in my court, was in a vulnerable place: Hardik Pandya’s defence on ‘Koffee with Karan’ controversy","“The ball was not in my court,” said Hardik Pandya as he sought to explain his outrageous comments on women in a TV show that led to his suspension and an outpouring of condemnation last year.

Pandya, along with teammate K.L. Rahul, drew a lot of flak after their conversation on Koffee with Karan went viral, prompting the BCCI to suspend them and institute an inquiry into their conduct.

In his latest statement on the episode, Pandya said things were not particularly in his control during the interview.

“We as cricketers did not know what was going to happen. The ball was not in my court, it was in someone else’s court where they had to take the shot and that’s a very vulnerable place, you don’t want to be (in it),” Pandya told India Today’s show Inspiration.

Pandya and Rahul were called back from an ongoing series against Australia at that time and their captain Virat Kohli too was openly critical of their comments on the show.

Both eventually came back after explaining themselves and apologising to the inquiry committee of the BCCI. While Rahul is currently playing in the T20 series against Sri Lanka, Pandya is recovering from a back injury.

Talking about cricketing matters, he downplayed comparisons with Mahendra Singh Dhoni who owned the No.7 slot before Pandya’s arrival into the team.

“I’ll never be able to fill MS’ shoes, so I don’t even think that way. I’m quite excited for the challenge to be honest. Whatever I do, it will be always for the team you know. It will be one step at the ladder and slowly-slowly that Cup will be there,” he said.

294,2020/01/09,"Calling people holding opposite view ‘urban Naxals’ is wrong, says minister","Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Wednesday said labelling people ‘urban Naxals’ for holding different views was a wrong practice of the previous government.

“I have sought a detailed report on the status of the Bhima-Koregaon violence, its investigation, and aftermath. Whoever disagreed with their views were termed urban Naxals, and this is wrong. The previous government had set an example in this regard,” the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader said, without naming the BJP.

The term, ‘urban Naxal’, was used by the Pune Police probing the alleged links between the Elgaar Parishad of December 31, 2017, and the clash at Bhima-Koregaon in Pune district the next day. Five rights activists were arrested in the case.

NCP chief Sharad Pawar in December last year had demanded that a Special Investigation Team be set up under a retired judge to probe the action taken by the Pune Police in the 2018 Bhima-Koregaon violence.

Commenting on the Mumbai Police registering an FIR against a girl named Mahek Prabhu for holding a ‘Free Kashmir’ poster during a protest at the Gateway of India, Mr. Deshmukh said the police are checking her antecedents.

295,2020/01/09,Protests fallout: Pune film fest screenings shifted out of FTII,"The protests at the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) in Pune against the violence at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have cast a shadow over the upcoming Pune International Film Festival (PIFF), prompting the organisers to cancel the film screenings and other events scheduled on the FTII campus.

While both PIFF organisers and FTII director Bhupendra Kainthola cited ‘unavoidable reasons’, sources said the recent student protests on a number of issues had led the organisers to shift the venue from FTII to the National Film Archive of India (NFAI)’s Kothrud premises.

The 18th edition of PIFF is to open on Thursday and will continue till January 16. As many as 1,900 entries have been received from 60 countries, of which 191 films are to be screened at the city’s PVR and INOX multiplexes, and NFAI’s Law College Road and Kothrud premises.

Vishal Shinde, deputy director (programmes and films), PIFF, said screenings could not be take place at FTII due to “technical reasons”.

Mr. Kainthola, however, said FTII is still very much part of the film festival and that the institute’s participation through the presence of its alumni in juries and workshops during the course of the festival will not be affected.

Earlier, Jabbar Patel, chairman and director, PIFF, had said that the opening and closing sessions of PIFF was to be held on the FTII premises as the institute is celebrating its diamond jubilee this year. The organisers had planned a number of workshops to be conducted in tandem with the film screenings to honour the institute’s contribution to Indian cinema.

“PIFF had approached us for recommending jury members, awards and workshops. We are very much part of these activities. We have recommended the two FTII alumni who are to be part of the PIFF international jury while FTII chairman B.P. Singh will be receiving the ‘PIFF Distinguished’ award,” Mr. Kainthola said.

While the FTII administration’s decision to nominate its own chairman for the award has raised eyebrows, Mr. Kainthola defended it, saying Mr. Singh is a noted filmmaker in his own right and has solid credentials in a career spanning nearly 40 years.

“Mr. Singh, who is creator of the popular television crime series CID, has featured in the Guinness Book of World Records for his record-breaking single-shot episode of 111 minutes… he is a filmmaker in his own right and not some johnny-come-lately. We have given this award after much consultation,” Mr. Kainthola said.

Meanwhile, students at FTII have alleged that they were not given free passes despite PIFF officials announcing to the press that the 18th edition of the film festival is celebrating film education in India and 60 years of FTII.

“FTII students themselves are not getting free passes despite the institute being an official sponsor of PIFF this time, which contradicts the whole purpose of celebrating film education. Moreover, the FTII director did not consult students before adding FTII as a venue for PIFF screenings,” Rajarshi Majumdar, general secretary of the FTII Students’ Association, said.

Students of FTII have already held two protests against the JNU violence. Thousands participated in a collective march on Tuesday which began at the FTII campus and saw the participation of students from the city’s other prominent educational centres like Savitribai Phule Pune University and Fergusson College.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/rfvrio/article30518406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BMMUMBAIUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/protests-fallout-pune-film-fest-screenings-shifted-out-of-ftii/article30518407.ece

298,2020/01/09,Hundreds join candle march in walled city,"Hundreds of people sat in front of the Jama Masjid in Delhi on Wednesday with candles and posters to protest against the amended citizenship law, NRC and the National Population Register.

Residents, mostly from all parts of Old Delhi —Lal Kuan, Gali Kasim, Bhuja Pandi and Ajmeri Gate - participated in the protest, where they also expressed solidarity with the students of the JNU and the Jamia Millia Islamia.

Children were also part of the candle march that started from Lal Kuan, passed through Chawri Bazaar and ended at Gate No. 1 of the Jama Masjid in Old Delhi where the crowd sat on the stairs of the mosque and shouted slogans.

On the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), Zeena Junaid (39) said they have their documents with them, but wondered what about those who do not documents.

“Where will our brothers and sisters from Sikh, Muslim, Hindu and other communities go if they fail to submit their documents?” she asked.

Seeda, also a resident of Lal Kuan, said why there had been no action against any culprit involved in assaulting students on campus.

Seeda alleged that the present government was not only attacking students, but were also creating communal disharmony in the country.

The protesters said they would not be sharing any details with the officials who would visit to verify their documents regarding the amended Citizenship Act.

“Boycott CAA” and “Can’t protect students in your own country and want to protect minorities of other countries” were among some of the posters held by the protesters. They also held banners mentioning the Preamble.

The protesters also questioned why no arrests had been made yet in connection with mob attack at the Jawaharlal Nehru University.

299,2020/01/09,Attacked JNU teacher feels police won’t find culprits,"The undulating Aravalli range which hosts the Jawaharlal Nehru University is perfect for biking. In the afternoon of January 5, Amit Thorat, Assistant Professor of the Centre for the Study of Regional Development, took his red bike to the meeting where a part of the JNU teachers community and the students led by the JNU Students Union sat to discuss the future of anti-fee hike agitation.

As the meeting rolled into the evening, the gathering decided to walk carrying placards and posters for dialogue towards the Periyar hostel which falls near the main entrance of the campus. As the meeting turned into a small rally, they were told that a group of outsiders had entered the campus and were now standing near the gate of Periyar hostel. Sucheta Talukdar, student of the Centre for Historical Studies, and her friends who were passing by Periyar when a hail of bricks hit them. They ran towards the rally and sounded the alert that a large gang was waiting for them at the Periyar hostel gate.

To check the situation from the backyard of Periyar, Dr. Thorat took his bike and parted from the gathering for few minutes. The lights had gone off inside the campus and what he saw in the twilight glow froze him. “There were around 50 to 60 boys swinging big sticks and rods and swinging them in the air and sitting on the road. They had faces covered with handkerchiefs,” said Mr. Thorat recollecting the eerie sight.

“It was like a horror movie because at that point I thought these were not students of the campus and they had come inside to do something dangerous,” he said. The gathering of masked intruders had not noticed Mr. Thorat till that point. Sensing the opportunity, Mr. Thorat took out a smart phone from his winter jacket’s point and clicked photograph. In the dark, the phone camera used the flash and drew attention of the armed gang.

“Within seconds they surrounded me and demanded to know how many photographs had I clicked. I took out the phone and deleted the photograph. But by then they began to hit me on shoulder, hands and on the back of my head,” said Mr. Thorat.

Thankfully, the blows were softened by the heavy winter jacket and the woollen cap, but the blow on his right shoulder has kept Mr. Thorat in pain since January 5 evening. Another part of the armed group, had by then split away and had begun to batter the teachers and students who were sitting near the Sabarmati Hostel where Mr. Thorat’s colleagues and students, including JNUSU President Aishe Ghosh, was brutally assaulted with iron rods and hockey sticks.

Four days later, Mr. Thorat recorded his experience with the Crime Branch of Delhi police on Wednesday but he doesn’t think that the police will find the culprits or find the real plotters of the assault on the campus.

Advocate Amit Sahni, also a social activist, has claimed in his plea that according to the Delhi Prison Rules of 2018, the SRB meetings have to be held every quarter. Mr. Sahni argued that the High Court on October 21 last year had directed that SRB meetings be held in accordance with the prison rules.

He said that since the October order, not a single meeting has been held yet and it amounts to “wilful disobedience” of judicial orders and sought contempt of court action against the officials concerned, including AAP MLA Satyendar Kumar Jain, the chairman of the SRB.

308,2020/01/09,"Women evicted from rented flat for protesting CAA, NRC","Surya Rajappan, 27, is a lawyer with the Delhi High Court. Her parents live in Delhi but she was staying with a friend in a rented flat in Lajpat Nagar. On January 5, the two women were threatened and abused by a 150-strong mob and evicted from the flat for peacefully protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens during Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally in the area. Excerpts from Ms. Rajappan’s Facebook post on the incident:

The Central government, after weeks of ignoring the peaceful protests against the CAA, announced that it would be launching a campaign in support of the Act. On January 5, Union Home Minister Amit Shah embarked on a pro-CAA rally with a door-to-door campaign in Lajpat Nagar in the heart of south Delhi.

We are — or rather, were — residents of the same locality. When we became aware of the pro-CAA rally led by Mr. Shah, we exercised our constitutional and democratic right to peacefully protest against the same.

To register our peaceful protest against the CAA and the NRC, my flatmate and I displayed a home-made, hand-crafted banner from our apartment balcony, just as the rally led by Mr. Shah was passing through our lane. The banner contained the slogans — Shame (in large capital letters), CAA (crossed out), NRC (crossed out), Jai Hind, Azaadi and #NotInMyName. I also raised certain slogans verbally to express my disapproval of the CAA and the NRC, such as “we reject CAA”, “we reject NRC”.

Upon noticing our protest, the members of the rally started getting agitated, and proceeded to verbally harass and intimidate us by shouting out threats and derogatory/misogynistic remarks. A mob of around 150 people collected on the street below our apartment. They were evidently enraged and threatened by the simple act of two girls protesting peacefully. The protest banner that we had hung from our balcony was torn and taken away. A group broke apart from the mob and forced its way up the stairs and threatened to break down the door if we did not let them in. We feared for our lives and safety and locked ourselves into our home, while they kept violently banging at our door and shouting until the police intervened.

The common entrance which led to the stairway of our house was locked and bolted by our landlord (who was a part of the angry mob) and we were trapped in the house. Terrified, we called our friends to come help us. When they arrived at the scene, the angry mob pushed them around and refused to let them enter the house. For three-four hours, we were trapped inside the house with an angry mob outside. In the meanwhile, our landlord (who was visibly livid) informed us that we had been evicted from our residence.

After a long period of time and multiple interventions by the police and our friends, my father was allowed to enter the premises along with a police officer. The police recorded our complaint against the criminal behaviour of the unruly mob. After seven hours, the door of the stairway was finally unlocked and we were allowed to leave the premises under police protection.

Over the course of the last 48 hours, we have feared for our lives and safety; our character and upbringing have also been questioned. We have also been accused of craving media attention – only for exercising our constitutional right to dissent peacefully.

As a part of the legal system, I beseech the judiciary to take stock of the unprecedented situation that India is facing, and to safeguard the constitutional rights of citizens. The intent of our founding fathers while drafting the Constitution was to protect the liberty of individuals against the abuse of power by the state. The Supreme Court has played an important role over the years to protect the Constitution and must continue to do so, now more than ever.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/women-evicted-from-rented-flat-for-protesting-caa-nrc/article30518319.ece

Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly, Vijender Gupta, alleged that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal was raising questions on registry of deeds being done by the registrar “under his own government” for his “political gain”.

“After getting the ownership rights, the people are now getting offers of loan from various banks... even the private banks are ready to give loans. We warn Arvind Kejriwal and the leaders of his party to not commit the sin of misleading lakhs of people of the unauthorised colonies. Otherwise people will teach them a lesson in the upcoming Assembly election,” Mr. Gupta said.

“We assure the 40 lakh residents of unauthorised colonies that the campaign of the BJP government to confer ownership rights is progressing fast. Now this will not stop till every household gets the registered documents,” he said further.

310,2020/01/09,"‘Compare education models of AAP, BJP’","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday challenged the BJP to compare work done by the latter in the field of education in BJP-ruled municipal corporation schools in Delhi and other States with the work done by the Delhi government-run schools.

“If you like their [BJP’s] model of education, then vote for them. I want to ask the BJP what their model of education is,” said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, while addressing a press conference. “AAP’s education model built schools and increased enrolment, but BJP’s education model shut down schools and lost students,” the Education Minister said.

He said that in Delhi government-run schools, the number of students has increased by 6,000 in the last four years, whereas the enrolment in municipal corporation-run schools has declined by 1.3 lakh during the same period.

“The Haryana government shut down 208 government schools between 2015 and 2018 and in the same period, the Rajasthan government closed 4,000 schools. The state of the erstwhile BJP-Akali-ruled Punjab is no better, with 217 government schools having shut in the last three years. In U.P., more than 40% of a total of 1,13,500 primary schools do not have electricity supply and the children are forced to attend classes in pathetic conditions,” he said.

The senior AAP leader also said that in Delhi, 109 primary schools run by the BJP-ruled municipal corporations have been shut down in the last nine years.

“Under the AAP government, 20,000 classrooms have been constructed, of which 8,000 have already been handed over and 12,000 are under construction. The AAP government has invested significantly in infrastructure, ensuring green boards in all classrooms and installing 7.5 lakh modular desks in classrooms apart from world-class sports facilities in schools.

311,2020/01/09,"Workers demand jobs, minimum wages","The all-India strike called by trade unions over “anti-worker” policies of the Central government on Wednesday evoked partial response in industrial areas in Delhi where workers were seen participating in protest marches and picketing.

In the Wazirpur Industrial area, scores of daily wage earners, construction workers and others assembled at the Shriram Chowk demanding better compensation and provisions for labourers.

Complaining of widespread unemployment, 53-year-old Shrikant Singh, a transport worker with a family of five to support, said: “At one point I was a manager at a factory here but now due to industries shutting up shop, I have to work as a daily wage earner and my income ranges between ₹300 and ₹350 on a given day. Why can’t the government ensure that minimum wages are paid to labourers?”

“By creating a divide between communities, the Centre is simply trying to distract us and hide its own faults. The same public who brought them to power is now being asked to prove their citizenship. Any Hindu who opposes them is anti-national and any Muslim who raises their voice is a terrorist. Instead of saying all this why can’t they concentrate on generating jobs?”

While opposing the proposed labour code, Rajiv Kumar Pandit, who was also at the protest, said, “One of the clauses is that daily wage labourers will get paid on hourly basis under the new law. How is that even possible? If a labourer works for three hours and returns to the chowk around noon, there is no way that he will get any other work for that day. What will happen to them then?”

“Looks like labourers are simply left to die... some in sewers, some in raging fire incidents and others due to hunger and deprivation,” Mr. Pandit added.

Demanding sufficient compensation from the government for days when poor air quality results in construction bans, 32-year-old Pramod Kumar, a resident of Bihar, said: “Even last year construction work was banned for many days due to air pollution. How are we supposed to sustain ourselves like this? It is not our fault. I want to appeal to the government to consider this aspect and help us.”

Human chain formed

At Okhla industrial area, members of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) assembled near Tehkand at 8 a.m. and formed a human chain. While several factories in the area continued to operate, some remained locked, with workers joining the protest. The protesters marched through the industrial area to Harkesh Nagar, sloganeering outside various factories that were open, persuading workers to joining their protest.

Those part of the protest, such as Kapil Kumar (39), an electrician, complained about unfair work conditions such as fewer leaves because of which he couldn't spend any time with his family and unfair work timings. Others such as Suraj Kumar, who works at a steel factory, said that minimum wage was not being implemented at many places. Those implementing minimum wages had increased work timings from eight hours to 12 hours, he alleged.

Pankaj Kumar (34), who worked as a technician at an NTPC thermal power plant which has now been shut, complained about lack of employment opportunities. “Most people who were let go from that plant were above the age of 30. Where are we supposed to get jobs now? No one will hire us,” he said. Workers at the plant had been unfairly employed as contract workers. We realised it was an issue when we were let go,"" he said.

Justice Pratibha M. Singh also directed the university to provide her with hostel facilities in the winter session commencing on January, 2020.

The judge said the manner in which the re-registration request of the scholar was being examined was “unsatisfactory” despite the Internal Complaints Committee’s (ICC) recommendations being in her favour. “Her continuation in the PhD. programme shall be as per the rules governing the said programme,” the High Court added.

On January 9, 2018, the research scholar had filed a complaint alleging sexual harassment, before the ICC of JNU.

After an enquiry that lasted nearly eight months, on August 2, 2018, the ICC submitted its report which recommended that her request for registration be considered.

The ICC had in August 2018 recommended that the scholar’s request for registration in the PhD programme be considered by the varsity and should not be rejected merely on ground of delay.

The ICC also recommended that one of the professors should be censured for creating uncertainty by not giving a No Objection Certificate to the complainant as well as directing her to de-register against her will. It recommended censuring the other professor for failing to place the application of the complainant for changing the supervisor before the faculty meeting that was a “lapse” on his part.

Advocate Dibyanshu Pandey, who had represented the scholar, said she has appealed against the ICC recommendations. Further representations were also made by her, however, as there was no response, she filed the petition before the High Court, he said.

313,2020/01/09,‘University authorities complicit in violence’,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association on Wednesday said that the Vice-Chancellor’s “command to students and faculty to forget and to accept administrative terror as normal is an insult to injury”. The association said that the initial silence and later comments by the V-C reinforced its view that the mob violence of January 5 could not have been possible without the active connivance of the JNU administration.

‘Eliminate evidence’

“No impartial inquiry is possible if it is conducted by the JNU administration or Delhi Police, as their roles have to be under scrutiny. No fair enquiry is possible as long as Mr. Kumar is the V-C... he must be dismissed,” the JNUTA said.

The teachers said there is a “distinct possibility” that an administration interested in shielding the culprits would eliminate important evidence like CCTV footage and other records of entry and exit into the campus.

“The JNU V-C has not a single syllable to waste for the faculty who were seriously injured by the masked assailants nor did he seem perturbed by the fact that the assailants chased families of residents and forcibly entered their homes, and criminally intimidated and terrorised their families,” the association said, adding that no medical, psychiatric, legal or academic assistance has been offered to students.

Meanwhile, a splinter group of the association, the JNU Teachers’ Federation (JNUTF), alleged that a few students had been “radicalised” following instigation from the JNUTA. “It is very unfortunate that a movement against hostel charges has now become fully violent with the active support and instigation by JNUTA members,” the JNUTF said.

In the afternoon of January 5, Amit Thorat, Assistant Professor of the Centre for the Study of Regional Developent, took his red bike to a meeting where a part of the JNU teachers community and students, led by the JNU Students’ Union, sat to discuss the future of anti-fee hike agitation.

As the meeting rolled into the evening, the gathering decided to walk carrying placards and posters for dialogue towards the Periyar Hostel, which falls near the main entrance of the campus. As the meeting turned into a small rally, they were told that a group of outsiders had entered the campus and were now standing near the gate of Periyar Hostel.

Sucheta Talukdar, a student of Centre for Historical Studies, and her friends who were passing by the hostel when a hail of bricks hit them. They ran towards the rally and raised an alarm that a large mob was waiting for them at the hostel gate.

Lights out

To check the situation, Dr. Thorat took his bike near the hostel. The lights had gone off inside the campus and what he saw in the twilight glow froze him. “There were around 50 to 60 boys swinging big sticks and rods in the air and sitting on the road. They had faces covered with handkerchiefs,” he said, recollecting the eerie sight.

“It was like a horror movie because at that point I thought these were not students of the campus and they had come inside to do something dangerous,” he said. The masked intruders had not noticed Dr. Thorat till that point. Sensing an opportune moment, he took out his phone from his winter jacket to click a photo.

In the dark, the flash of the phone drew the attention of the armed gang.

“Within seconds they surrounded me and demanded to know how many photographs I had clicked. I took out the phone and deleted the photograph. But by then they began to hit me on the shoulder, hands and back of my head,” said Dr. Thorat.

In pain

Thankfully, the blows were softened by his heavy winter jacket and woolen cap, but a blow to his right shoulder has kept Dr. Thorat in pain since the incident.

A part of the armed group had by then broken off and was brutally assaulting teachers and students near the Sabarmati Hostel.

JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh suffered serious inujries during the violence.

On Wednesday, the Delhi police said they have received a total of 11 complaints from students and teachers in connection with the JNU violence.

Seven complaints are from Left-affiliated groups and three from BJP-affiliated ABVP. One is from JNU professor Sucharita Sen.

“All the complaints have been forwarded to the Crime Branch SIT for further probe. The two FIRs of vandalism at CIS room have also been forwarded to the Crime Branch,” said a senior police officer.

Over 50 videos

The officer added that more than 50 mobile videos of violence have been submitted by students and teachers to the SIT.

“The videos will be sent to forensic to clear the mask faces that will help in identification,” said the officer.

Security guards and locals admitted that they have witnessed outsiders armed with sticks and baseball bats entering JNU campus.

“We have recorded the statements of around 20 security guards and also approached the vendors outside the campus to record their statement,” a police officer said.

‘Violence resurged’

A police personnel who was inside the campus and responded to the call of violence made from Periyar Hostel said that they had dispersed the crowd at the hostel and the situation was updated to the senior officer. But they were unaware that the mob had started gathering and the attack was about to take place.

“We thought the fight had ended, but when we again got calls of violence at 7 p.m., we rushed towards Sabarmati T-point were we saw a mob of around 200 people attacking a group of students and teachers.

319,2020/01/09,Gurugram-Bawal auto hub comes to a halt as workers join protest,"Around two dozen companies, including Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) Private Limited, in the Gurugram-Bawal automotive belt remained shut on Wednesday in response to the nationwide bandh call by various trade unions against the “anti-worker” policies of the Centre.

Leaders of several trade unions and government employees from banks, post offices, municipal corporations, forest department and industrial training institutes took out in protest marches and held demonstrations across the city in support of their demands.

All-India Trade Union Congress Gurugram general-secretary Anil Pawar told The Hindu that workers’ unions in around two dozen automotive companies took part in the strike.

“The workers gathered at a vacant plot in the Industrial Model Township, Manesar, around noon and were addressed by the trade union leaders. Around 3,500 workers gathered in protest against the anti-worker policies of the present regime,” claimed Mr. Pawar.

Besides HMSI, Munjal Showa Limited, Napino Auto and Electronics Limited, Sanoh India Private Limited, Hema Engineering Industries Limited and M.K. Auto Clutch Industry in IMT, Manesar remained shut.

Scores of workers from public sector banks, Haryana Urban Development Authority, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, Haryana Forest Department, post office and leaders from different trade unions took out a protest march from Kamla Nehru Park to Rao Mahabir Singh Chowk near bus stand around noon. Centre of Indian Trade Unions Haryana vice-president Satvir Singh said the huge turnout, despite the rain, was a manifestation of the workers’ anger against the policies of the government.

Slogans against govt.

Later in the day, the workers of Bellsonica Auto Component India Private Limited and the union leaders of Maruti Suzuki India Limited took out a protest march from Rajiv Chowk till mini-secretariat, raising slogans against the government. Bellsonica Auto Component India Employees Union vice-president Ajit Singh said that a memorandum was submitted to the President through the district administration in support of their demands, including minimum wages, abolition of the contract system, no lay-offs in the name of economic slowdown and rollback of Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Population Register.

Maruti Udhyog Kamgaar Union general-secretary Kuldeep Janghu accused the Narendra Modi government of working for only a couple of corporate houses and privatising public sector undertakings. “Those who oppose the policies of the Modi government are labelled anti-nationals. The workers need to understand the policies of the government and protest against them,” exhorted Mr. Janghu.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a0dmjn/article30517981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9DEGURUGRAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gurugram-bawal-auto-hub-comes-to-a-halt-as-workers-join-protest/article30517982.ece
320,2020/01/09,2 women protesting against CAA evicted from house,"Two women who protested from the balcony of a Delhi apartment when Union Home Minister Amit Shah was holding an outreach programme in support of the contentious citizenship law, said they have been evicted from their house.

Surya Rajappan, a lawyer, said when the BJP president was holding a door-door contact drive at Lajpat Nagar in south Delhi on Sunday in support of the amended Citizenship Act, she and her flatmate displayed a banner from their apartment balcony.

The banner had slogans “Shame” in large capital letters, with CAA, NRC crossed out. They also wrote the messages Jai Hind, ‘Azaadi’ (Freedom) and #NotInMyName.

“To register our peaceful protest to the CAA and the NRC and to make our point that not all onlookers to this government parade were in support of the same, my flatmate and I displayed a home-made hand-crafted banner from our apartment balcony, just as the rally led by Amit Shah was passing through our lane,” the 27 year-old said.

On noticing the protest, the members of the rally were enraged and verbally abused them, alleged Ms. Rajappan, who was brought up in Delhi and had shifted to Lajpat Nagar as it was more convenient to commute to the Delhi High Court from there.

A mob of around 150 people gathered on the street below their apartment. The protest banner that they had hung from the balcony was torn and taken away, according to the woman.

Ms. Rajappan said a group broke away from the mob that gathered downstairs and forced their way up the stairs which lead to her residence and threatened to break down the door if they were not let in.

“Not anticipating such a strong and violent reaction to a peaceful protest, we feared for our lives and safety, and locked ourselves into our home, while they kept violently banging at our door and shouting until the police intervened,” she said.

However, their ordeal had just begun.

They were trapped in the house as the common entrance, which led to the stairway of their house, was locked and bolted by their landlord, she alleged.

Terrified, the two women called their friends for help.

The pleas of their friends that they should be allowed to peacefully leave the house were ignored by the frenzied mob. They were trapped for three-four hours inside the house with an angry mob outside, the lawyer said.

“In the meanwhile, our landlord, who was livid, informed us that we had been evicted from our residence. After a long period of time and multiple interventions by the police and our friends, my father was allowed to enter the premises along with a police officer,” she said.

Ms. Rajappan said the police recorded their complaint against the “criminal behaviour” of the unruly mob.

“After a period of seven hours, the door of the stairway was finally unlocked and we were allowed to leave the premises under the protection of the police. We packed our essentials and left,” she added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2-women-protesting-against-caa-evicted-from-house/article30517921.ece
321,2020/01/09,A toast to the sun: How the harvest festivals are celebrated in the hinterlands,"Bikash Pratim Buragohain Farmer from Barpathar in Upper Assam

In Assam, the day before bhogali bihu or magh bihu is called Uruka — community feasting by a bonfire.

Families get together and contribute to the meal that is to be cooked: not by way of money, but meat, fish, rice, vegetables or anything grown and bred by us.

That night, the men cook out in the open, while the women and children sit by the fire and sing songs, play games or engage in marathon pitha-making sessions.

Assamese pithas like til pitha (made of sticky rice), gheela pitha (made with jaggery and rice flour), narikolor laru (coconut laddoo) and poka laru (laddoos made with rice flour and jaggery and hard as stone). It is a night of revelry, as we get together to celebrate our harvest and take stock of what could have gone better. With every farmer’s barn full, we do not hesitate to feed as many people as possible.

Once the food is prepared, we dine inside a bhela ghor (a temporary house made of leftover dried straws and banana leaves). Those who do not make the bhela ghor prepare the meji by arranging logs of fire wood.

The following day is called magh bihu. Before sunrise, everyone in our household takes a bath, our houses are cleansed and doors and windows are opened for ‘goodness’ to flow in.

The sutal or the front yard gets a fresh coating of cow dung and mud and then we offer our respect to the bhela ghor by lighting an earthen lamp inside it, before setting it on fire with offerings of til, rice and dubori bon to show our gratitude to the field and the sky for the good year that went by and for the year to come.

Following this, we sit for another round of feasting or jolpan — Assamese breakfast of homemade cereal made of rice like muri, akhoi, hurum, xandoh, or sira. These are best enjoyed with curd and juliya gur (a runny form of jaggery which is almost like caramel). We set the curd in earthen pots.

Our main breakfast is followed with homemade snacks and pithas. Two must-haves are tubers like kaath alu (air potato) and kosu pura (roasted colocasia).

The rest of the day goes in visiting friends and family, or taking part in the village games.

This festival also marks the beginning of our planning for the coming ploughing season, saving and exchanging seeds.

As told to Prabalika M Borah

M Malar Mannan Farmer, jallikattu champion, and bull-rearer from Alanganallur village in Tamil Nadu

In rural Tamil Nadu, you know it is Pongal time when you see a fresh coat of limewash on the walls of houses. We limewash our homes, use kaavi (a red pigment) highlights wherever necessary, a couple of days leading up to the festival. The night before, a small bunch of bright yellow aavaram flowers (Senna auriculata) and white koorai flowers (Aerva lanata) are suspended at the doorway.

The heroes of the big day are farm animals; cows and bulls, especially. They play a key role in agriculture and toil in our fields all through the year. On Pongal day, we pay them our obeisance. They are like our children. We bathe the animals, apply turmeric paste on their bodies, decorate their faces with kumkum pottu, garland them. We tie flowers around the feet of cows and salangai (brass bells) for bulls.

Members of the household, bedecked in new clothes, gather around a makeshift stove made of stacked bricks or stones at dawn. This time of the year is when farmers have money on them, and hence, they spend it on clothes and good food. On the stove, set up outdoors in front of the doorway, sits a clay pot that bubbles with a heady concoction of milk, just-harvested rice, toor dal, jaggery, and ghee. This dish, the star of the season, is first offered on a banana leaf to the sun. We worship the sun and hence offer him the dish made from the first harvest of the season.

The cows and bulls are fed next, followed by the children and then adults. We then distribute the pongal among our neighbours. Festivities last for three days. The best part is, farm animals are untied and allowed to graze freely, as much as they please. They meet their friends, run about. Everyone is happy.

As told to Akila Kannadasan

B Gangadharamurthy Manager, Grameena Angadi, which markets rural artisans’ work in Karnataka

We call the time during Sankranti suggi kala. Harvest is a time of happiness for farmers, after many months of hard work of planting and growing the crops.

In the villages of Karnataka, the celebrations begin in the morning. New clothes are worn, the cow is cleaned, fed (till its stomach is full!), decorated and a special puja is done. Games are played, such as the one which involves making the cow jump over fire. A torana made of rice grains still in their husks is hung at the doorways of houses and even the rangoli drawn in front of houses has elements of what has been harvested. Of course, it is compulsory that yellu bella (a mix of sesame seeds, jaggery, dry coconut or copra, groundnuts and fried gram) is made, for neighbours to give and receive from each other.

There is a saying, “yellu bella kottu olle mathadu”. It refers to the good wishes and blessings people give each other on this day, along with the yellu bella and sugarcane. This is a time of sowhara (harmony). Yellu bella has many health benefits and after so many months of hard work, the farmers need the energy they get by eating it. It is something made only during Sankranti, by all families.

322,2020/01/09,Remembering telegrams,"Ahead of the District level Philately Exhibition ‘Rakshapex 2020’ at Bengaluru organised by the Department of Posts on January 9, 10 and 11 at Malleswaram, 11-year-old Jishnu PS is happy to say he would be a participant there showcasing his original telegrams.

Telegrams is not a very common subject of interest or hobby to many, but Jishnu, a 6th standard student of Bunts Sangha RNS Vidya Niketan in Vijayanagar, is exited that he was pulled into this past-time as some of his family members are numismatics and philately collectors who generated the interest. “Even out of curiosity I would be asking my family members about what telegrams were, and how it would help people then. I would be shocked to hear that telegrams were the fastest mode of communication. It is hard to believe, as we are enjoying the age of email and mobile phones now,” says Jishnu, who is eager to showcase his telegrams, 125original in all that he has collected. “I have sourced a lot on my own, but my grandpa septuagenarian P. Subramanyam Setty, a member of the Karnataka Numismatics Society, too helped me,” he says.

Popularly known as taar, what most of the elderly remember about telegrams is the shock they had in 2011 when BSNL hiked the price of telegram after 60 years from four rupees to 27 rupees (for 50 words). By then it was already a loss-making unit and 2013 saw the last of telegrams in India. “I remember my father, a businessman, telling me so much about this “fastest mode of communication” which was seen as the harbinger of change. Although telegrams brought good and bad news for 160 years in India, the ‘something urgent’ feature in it always made us fear,” recalls Subramanyam Setty.

As far as Setty knows, nobody has collected telegrams, and the family thought this ‘relic of the past’ would be a record for people to see in the coming generations. “Whenever we spoke about telegrams, my grandson Jishnu would ask us umpteen questions and would say, “I will collect telegrams.”

To take his interest across, the family wrote to the Post Master General about Jishnu’s rare collection. “Last year Jishnu was given a special permission to take part in the State level Philately Exhibition ‘Karnapex 2019’ conducted in Mangaluru where he was the youngest boy to display two frames (32 sheets) of original telegrams and the only one to take part in the telegram category,” states Setty. “I am happy that my first participation at the Mangaluru Philately exhibition got me a Broze medal, and that was another inspiration for me,” adds Jishnu, already a member of the Karnataka Philately Society.

“There are plain telegrams, those with festival and marriage greetings and with advertisements on the side and on the envelope,” says Jishnu who has telegrams from 1907 to 2013. “I also have telegram booking forms. I have collected telegrams from all over India. I persuaded people to part with their telegrams to help my collection. Showing his telegram of 1914 sent from Burma to India during the World War I, which was censored by the Government, Jishnu says, “My dream is to take part in the National Philately Exhibition. I request people to send me rare telegrams.”

History of the telegram service

Dating back to 1850, the first telegraph line in India, though only experimental, was established between Calcutta and Diamond Harbour, with the British East India Company using the telegraph in 1851. It took them three years to lay the telegraph lines across the country. India opened its telegraph service to public in 1854 and the first telegram was sent from Mumbai to Pune. The telegraph services thrived after Alexander Graham Bell patented the telephone in 1876. The 1980s saw the golden period as more than one lakh telegrams were being sent and received per day, especially in Delhi. From 1902, the Indian system went wireless. Gradually the telephone in the late 1990s slowed down the telegraph service, soon making it a loss-incurring facility. The government decided to stop telegrams in 2013, a communication service that had served the people of India for over 160 years.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/sqgxa3/article30522201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGM-TELEGRAM-JISHNU,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/jishnu-ps/article30522202.ece
323,2020/01/09,KRMB puts off decision on shifting office,"The Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) has put off the decisions over shifting of the board office to Vijayawada/Amaravati, as was being demanded by Andhra Pradesh, following the AP’s indecision over the location of the board headquarters and also the use of water during the flood period by the member States.

However, the board meeting held here on Thursday has allowed the two States to continue sharing the Krishna waters in the 66 (AP):34 (TS) ratio as agreed by them in the past. A three-member committee meeting that followed the board meeting has allocated 220 tmc of water for irrigation and drinking water needs of the two States till May-end.

The meeting chaired by R.K. Gupta was attended by Chief Secretary (Telangana) Somesh Kumar, who also handles the irrigation portfolio, Special Chief Secretary (water resources) of AP Aditya Nath Das, two Engineers-in-Chief and other officials. According to the officials, Telangana would get 140 tmc ft and AP would get 80 tmc ft out of the total allocation of 220 tmc ft. As per the board statistics, AP has utilised 511 tmc ft and Telangana has availed 158 tmc ft water so far this water year starting from June 1, 2019.

Outstanding issues

The board has decided to take the issue to the notice of shifting the board’s office to AP to the notice of the Union Water Resources Ministry, now known as Jal Shakti, during the meeting organised by it on January 21 with the two States towards resolving the outstanding issues and disputes. The issue of shifting the board office has been in the KRMB agenda during the last four meetings. When it came up for discussion in Thursday’s meeting, the Telangana officials were said to have sought to know from their AP counterparts as to where the board’s office would be located. However, the AP side did not specify the planned location of board in the backdrop of the AP’s plans to shift its capital.

The board has avoided a decision on the utilisation of water during the flood period stating that it would take a view at the end of the water year. In the meantime, the board is understood to be planning to take the matter to the notice of the Central Water Commission (CWC) and the Jal Shakti Ministry.

Telangana complains

The issue of excess drawal was raised by Telangana but the AP side justified it stating that it had only availed flood water that would, otherwise, go waste into the sea.

When the AP side wanted the board to direct Telangana to remove four sluices on Nagarjunasagar Left Canal before the inter-state boundary to allow free flow of water into AP, Telangana officials were learnt to have objected to it stating that it was an arrangement made during the combined AP Government to ensure reach of water to 20,000 acres in the tail-end areas in Telangana.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/w74umi/article30527235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10KRMB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/krmb-puts-off-decision-on-shifting-office/article30527236.ece

The accused SI P Sudheer Reddy was caught red-handed while accepting the bribe from complainant Motaparthi Vamshi Krishna who was released on station bail and for referring his case to Lok Adalat by removing Section 406 (Punishment for criminal breach of trust) of IPC from a case registered against him.

A case was registered against Krishna on December 29 last for evading payment of ₹33,130 to Akshaya K of Page 3 Luxury Salon, after he and his wife, availed their services. He was arrested and released on station bail on December 31.

“For having him released on station bail and referring the case to Lok Adalat for settlement, Balvanthaiah through Sudheer demanded ₹1 lakh bribe,” an ACB official said. After a hard bargain, the inspector settled for ₹50,000 and two bottles of whisky.

Sudheer asked Krishna to bring the money to a location on Road No. 10 of Jubilee Hills on Thursday around 2 p.m. In the meantime, Krishna lodged a complaint with ACB officials who followed him to the spot and laid a trap.

After trapping Sudheer, the ACB officials asked the SI to make a phone call informing the inspector that he received the payment. “That conversation was recorded as evidence to prove Balvanthaiah’s involvement in the case,” the officer said.

“Soon after getting information about the trap, the inspector who was on bandobast duty left his official vehicle, changed the uniform and fled. He will be nabbed soon,” he said.

325,2020/01/09,"Gandhi’s statues in all mandals of Telangana, AP","To propagate Mahatma Gandhi’s values and introduce his ideology to the younger generation, the Gandhi Global Family and Gandhi Gyan Pratishtan have decided to install Mahatma Gandhi’s statues in all the mandal headquarters of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The first to be installed will be inaugurated by people’s activist Anna Hazare at the Mahatma Gandhi College of Education in Hayatnagar mandal on January 20. A team of the Gandhi Global Family met him at his village, Ralegan Siddhi seeking his consent.

Chairman of the Gandhi Global Family, Gunna Rajender Reddy said that orders for making 1,100 Gandhi statues have been given and the idea was to reconnect his ideology to the younger generation that is losing touch with his contributions. The relevance of Gandhi’s values are being recognised by several countries in the world now. His presence is seen in 206 countries in the form of statues or Gandhi study centres while 150 countries have released his stamps. However, in his own country the younger generation is just fed with information on his contribution in the freedom struggle.

“But there is lot more to his contribution to the world in terms of promoting non-violence and fighting on behalf of the suppressed. It is time for people to rediscover Mahatma Gandhi when the world is going through a crisis,” Mr. Reddy said.

A committee has been on tour visiting all mandal headquarters seeking land for the statues and the response has been tremendous, Mr. Reddy said. The statue will have 11 principles of Gandhi etched on a plaque and the other discourses on moral values.

The Prime Minister, Narendra Modi too has been focussing on this aspect in his public speeches as well as interactions with common people on his ‘Mann Ki Baat,’ Mr. Reddy said. “We hope Mahatma Gandhi is devoted more space at the school level to ensure that youngsters are exposed to his message of non-violence.”

The Gandhi Global Family has been in forefront of 150th birth celebrations. A massive gathering of 5,000 students dressed in Gandhi’s attire was held at Nalgonda and the Guinness Book of World Records also issued a Certificate of Appreciation.

The petitioner apprehended that the public meeting to be held on Friday would cause inconvenience and chaos like the million march held last Sunday in the city protesting against the CAA and NRC.

Justice Vinod Kumar posted the writ petition for Friday. A similar protest meeting organised by a Joint Action Committee last Sunday had sent traffic haywire, creating chaos for hours together, the petitioner stated.

327,2020/01/09,TS pursuing plans to propel civil aviation sector,"Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao on Thursday said Telangana government plans to re-activate old airports, create greenfield airports and establish a chain of heliports to connect the remote parts of the State.

This would help connect districts such as Adilabad and allow easy access to high footfall tourist destinations such as Yadadri, he told a curtain raiser event in New Delhi for the WINGS 2020 civil aviation event to be held at Begumpet airport, Hyderabad.

The event, with Flying for All as its theme, is scheduled to be held from March 12-15. The Global Aviation Summit that used to be held in Mumbai is also coming to Hyderabad. Mentioning about the plans of the State government for the civil aviation sector, the Minister requested Central government funding support for creating the infrastructure. He also urged the Civil Aviation Ministry to accord necessary approvals. Union Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri and Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation Pradeep Singh Kharola participated in the curtain raiser event.

Mr. Rao said the State government is working with various stakeholders to make Warangal airport functional and thus provide a boost to regional air transport and support the mega textile park and the IT hub launched in the city. There are also plans to open a heliport in Warangal airport on subsidy basis such that investors and operators find it viable.

A greenfield airport is planned at Kothagudam which can connect the coal belt, mines and power sector ecosystem around Khammam district. An airport is also proposed at Jakranpally which will support the upcoming Pharma City NIMZ, the Minister said.

Highlighting the policy initiatives, he said aviation and aerospace is a thrust sector for the State government. Telangana was the first to slash value-added tax (VAT) on ATF (Aviation Turbine Fuel) from 16% to 1% setting an example for others. This gave a significant boost to regional airline industry, prompting leading operators such as Spice Jet and Indigo to expand their operational base in Hyderabad, he added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/s6w6h9/article30527467.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10AIPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-pursuing-plans-to-propel-civil-aviation-sector/article30527022.ece

Along with Mr Reddy, his trusted aide, Rajya Sabha member V. Vijaysai Reddy would also appear before the court. Security has been beefed up ahead of the AP CM’s appearance before the CBI special court judge on the 12th floor of Gagan Vihar building on the bustling Nampally-MJ Market road.

During his padayatra in AP before the Assembly polls in May, 2019, Mr. Reddy filed a petition in the High Court seeking blanket exemption from appearances before the CBI court. However, the HC dismissed his petition stating that such relief cannot be granted.

But the HC observed that Mr. Reddy was at liberty to approach the trial court to seek exemption from time to time by filing dispense with presence petition. Since then, Mr. Reddy (then the main opposition leader in AP Assembly) applied for exemption from appearance and secured favourable orders. He appeared before the CBI court last time in March, 2019.

After becoming the CM of AP, Mr Reddy secured exemption by filing petitions in the CBI court. Eventually, Mr. Reddy’s lawyers again filed a petition in the trial court seeking blanket exemption from appearances. The CBI authorities opposed the petition stating that Mr. Reddy should have approached the Supreme Court and not the trial court since the HC had earlier dismissed his petition on the same issue.

On January 3 this year, the CBI special court judge passed an order that both Mr. Reddy and Vijayasai Reddy should appear before the court during the next hearing which falls on Friday.

329,2020/01/09,"‘CAA, NRC, NPR conspiracy to take away properties’","Noted social activist and Narmada Bachao Andolan founder Medha Patkar on Thursday said that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens combined are a conspiracy to weaken the society and take away properties of Indian citizens.

Ms Patkar was speaking at the Convention Against NRC-NRC-NPR where she said, “They (citizens) will be busy getting paperwork in order, and their sampatti (properties) will be snatched from them. This is a certainty. This has happened with Adivasis, Dalits and Muslims. Where are the documents?” she asked and added that a similar ‘conspiracy’ unfolded in Gujarat and will also be seen across the country.

The NRC and NPR exercise, she said, would drain the treasury. She explained that instead of allocating funds for these exercises, important issues such as farmer’s income and affordable healthcare, women empowerment and employment should be preponderant.

“Today, the annual average income of Telangana’s farmers is ₹6,300. Today, in Telangana, domestic workers and others, you see their state, everything is clear. We want that law be made for such issues and the fundamentals of the Constitution be followed,” she said as she touched upon the economic inequalities in societies.

“Despite several land parcels being vacant, there is no industry. And to cover this up, the Reserve Bank of India coffers are being emptied,” she said.

Touching upon several families which have been excluded from the NRC in Assam, she said that the family of former President of India Faqruddin Ali Ahmed too has not been included. She also urged people to understand how problematic the detention centres are and take into consideration the deaths of inmates at these places.

Ms Patkar said that if the need arises, everybody opposing the CAA, NRC and the NPR must come together – under one banner.

She gave the call to reject National Register of Citizens and to take up the cause of National Resistance to Communalism, National Resistance to Casteism, and National Resistance to Corporatism.

Ms Patkar also touched upon the situation in cities like Muzaffarnagar and Meerut and maintained that Muslims were being targeted.

Prof P L Vishweshwar Rao, and Ramon Magsasay awardee Prof Sandeep Pande also spoke.

330,2020/01/09,Minorities panel writes to TS govt. on CAA,"The Telangana State Minorities Commission has sent a letter to the State government asking it to urge the Centre to reconsider its stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and the National Register of Citizens.

The minorities panel was responding to a petition filed by city-based activist S Q Masood, who in his representation stated that legislation and the NRC were ‘ultra-vires’.

“On Dec 23, 2019 this Commission and all its members unanimously decided to forward the petition to government for necessary action. Hence request you to kindly examine the petition and take necessary action to move the matter to the Central government for reconsideration,” an excerpt from a letter from the Commission to the Principal Secretary to the State government reads.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr Masood said that he approached the Commission as it deals with issues such as discrimination of minorities. The CAA, he claimed, is not only discriminatory, but also against the Constitution.

“The CAA shockingly uses religion as a key determinant to confer Indian citizenship. This was not the case in 1955. The new Act is a violation of Article 14, 15 and 21. The CAA and the NRC, and now NPR, are dangerous for all citizens, especially Muslims. I wrote to the Commission because it is a body which protects minorities, including Muslims. It can issue recommendations to the Telangana government. I hope it does something to stop the CAA and NRC combine,” Mr Masood said.

331,2020/01/09,"‘Universities are hubs of free discussions, debates’","Universities are not only citadels of learning and enrichment but are places of free discussions and debates, and that particular way of thinking should be preserved, felt Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar awardee and CEO of Wellcome Trust Shahid Jameel.

He expressed these views while delivering a lecture on “What is a University?”, on Thursday to mark the 22nd Foundation Day celebrations of Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MANUU).

Taking a critical view of the contemporary education system, he argued that it neither supports innovation nor encourages civic sense and stressed the need to equip students with problem-solving aptitude.

Dr. Jameel quoted extensively from eminent personalities such as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Maulana Azad to draw home his point. Comparing the western education system with Indian education, he expressed dismay over the procedure adopted here for appointments and assessments. “Hierarchical governance is not good for universities,” he said.

“We need to trust each other. However, we discuss personalities instead of ideas. He pointed out that education is both private and public good. It prepares pragmatic citizens,” he said.

Speaking about funding, he said that universities facing shortage of funds should look for external resources like CSR support.

MANUU Vice-Chancellor Mohammad Aslam Parvaiz said that the foundation day was in fact a day of self assessment and emphasised the importance of training over education. He pointed out at the Japanese model of education system and said that inspiration should be drawn from it.

332,2020/01/09,"Delhi Police probing JNU incidents, action will be taken against perpetrators, says Kishan Reddy","Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said on Thursday that the Delhi Police is investigating the violent incidents inside the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) campus and action will be taken soon against the perpetrators. “A FIR has been filed and we are trying to identity the culprits behind the incidents,” he said.

Mr. Reddy was answering questions at a press conference organised by the Telangana Union of Working Journalists (TUWJ). Listing out the various programmes and initiatives taken up by the BJP- led NDA Government in the last six months, the Minister said necessary changes have been made in the NIA Act to permit the premier investigative agency to take up probe in countries abroad during any terror attacks on Indian citizens.

No substitutes for Citizenship Card

“We have already got into pacts with a few countries and talks are on with few other countries,” he said. The country also needs a proper Citizenship Card as is prevalent in most countries around the world,” he observed. Moreover, “Voter ID card, Aadhaar, and the likes cannot substitute for the Citizenship Card as necessary legal changes have not been made. Also, the Supreme Court has already put restrictions on the usage of Aadhaar on privacy issue,” he reminded.

Mr. Reddy admitted that certain strong measures are underway in Jammu & Kashmir but it was only to prevent violent and terror incidents. “We will start removing some of the restrictions like those on internet, gradually. Curfew has been lifted and Section 144 is restricted to a few places. Stone-pelting and terror incidents have come down drastically,” he claimed.

Scouting for land in Kashmir

The Government has been scouting for public land for permitting industries and other programmes. “There are fears of taking over J&K lands and handing them over to people from other States. It is because of this apprehension we had put off the investment summit. From next month, all the Union Ministers will be touring the State,” he said.

333,2020/01/09,Ready to change CAA if it affects even one out of 130 crore citizens: Kishan Reddy,"The Government is ready to change the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) if “even one citizen of the 130 crore is adversely affected by it,” asserted Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy on Thursday. “Our Government has brought forth the CAA with full responsibility as a special drive to provide citizen status to refugees from the neighbourhood who had faced religious persecution,” he explained.

Stating that the Government had not expected such a “vicious false propaganda against the CAA”, the Minister said Muslim citizens have no ground to fear and assured that even in the census operations about to commence for the National Population Register (NPR), no document need to be shown and urged them not to believe “wrong stories being circulated in the social media.”

No Cabinet discussion on NRC

Participating in the ‘Meet the Press’ programme organised by the Telangana Union of Working Journalists (TUWJ) here, Mr. Reddy said although the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did mention about the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Government has not taken it up and there has been no discussion in the Union Cabinet. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has the final word on NRC, it does not matter what anyone else has said,” he averred.

The Minister stated that the Government is still trying to frame rules and regulations for the CAA, and as of now it does not have any precise figure on the number of refugees. “The Government has taken note of apprehensions in some States about the CAA, including those in the Northeast and its intent is not to bulldoze them into accepting it,” Mr. Reddy allayed.

“We will hold discussions with such States and seek to remove misconceptions because this has been a long standing assurance of the Indian Government from the time of the first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to accept minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who faced discrimination,” he claimed.

Muslims from these nations have, in any case, been obtaining citizenship through the process of “naturalisation”, and they could continue to do so. Mr. Reddy urged those opposing the Census operations and NPR to understand that it is constitutionally mandated and continuing from the British times to understand the profile of citizens to take up various welfare and development schemes.

“It is not fair or right to say that Census enumerators will not be allowed to collect details. There is no need to furnish any birth certificates. This is my assurance as Union Minister. But ultimately people of the country would decide who is right,” he affirmed.

Detention centres nothing to do with CAA

Deploring the ‘false’ narrative on ‘detention centres’, Mr. Reddy said these were established by Congress Governments in Assam and Karnataka. “But these were for visa/passport expired foreigners only, and nothing to do with CAA,” he claimed.

Mr. Reddy also criticised the TRS Government for adhering to the agenda of allies like Majlis for permitting anti-CAA protests only. “The TS Government has not sent a single beneficiary’s name for the Centre to release funds for housing programme, despite reminders,” he claimed.

Ms. Esar said that the Consulate of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was a step in the economy-driven policy of the country. “This will serve Afghans and provide links between business communities,” she said.

He was the chief guest at the third convocation of Jawaharlal Nehru Architecture and Fine Arts University (JNAFAU) at Shilpakala Vedika on Wednesday.

Delivering his convocation address, Mr. Khan said that any institute’s distinctive strength should be in encouraging its students to collaborate and to put their integrated knowledge to work for the common good and for an inclusive kind of leadership for the country.

Introducing a note of caution, he said, “These are turbulent times for all of us professionals, especially with sluggish economy, dull real estate, fear and uncertainty in the market and a transition period between a cash-based economy to a cashless one. Architecture, interiors, arts and other related subjects can be the first casualty in such a transition. Yet, all of you need to learn to cope up with these challenges.”

The New Education Policy being rolled out would have far reaching impact on the future face of profession and it would be noticed in about five years from now. “You not only have to cope up with this but transform yourself to face the challenges,” he said.

He urged the students to look carefully and sensitively at brain-drain. “While it is important to widen ones learning in foreign lands, the acquired knowledge must be used and utilised for the betterment and advancement of our own country”.

Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan, who presided over the convocation, said that modern architecture should have a connect with traditional art and one should take inspiration from ones ancient traditions. “Art is immortal as it captures the essence of the represented object for posterity and it is important to project our ancient sites,” she said, and recalled that a major event organised at Mahabalipuram Shore temple attracted tourists in lakhs from China and other countries.

338,2020/01/09,State files plea in HC over single-judge instructions on delimitation,"A day after a single judge of Telangana High Court passed an interim direction over delimitation of three divisions of Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar (MCK), the State government on Wednesday filed an appeal before a division bench of the High Court on the matter. The bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, however, declined to hear the appeal observing that the petitioner had failed to furnish order copy of the single judge.

The bench is likely to hear the appeal plea in a day or two following submission of the order copy. The MCK Commissioner G. Venu Gopal Reddy, who filed the appeal on behalf of the government, sought suspension of the single judge order paving way for the polls to the city’s civic body.

The petitioner stated that the order was passed without appreciating facts and circumstances. The order is contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court, the petitioner stated.

Writ petitions

Four writ petitions relating to division of ward nos. 3, 24 and 25 in KMC were filed before the single judge bench. The petitioners alleged that the mandatory delimitation procedures were not followed during division of wards.

Both, these writ petitions and a PIL plea seeking deferment of municipal polls across the State, came up for hearing before the single judge and the division bench respectively the previous day. The division bench, which continued to hear the arguments till 6.30 p.m., dismissed the PIL plea giving green signal to elections in 120 municipalities and 10 municipal corporations in the State.

A little later, the single judge passed an oral order directing the authorities to make corrections to the delimitation of division nos. 3, 24 and 25 in the MCK without stalling the process of elections.

However, changing boundaries of the divisions would involve some official procedures and issuing of notifications.

Hence, the SEC did not include MCK in the list of municipal corporations for which polls are to be held in a notification issued on Tuesday night.

As the single judge instructions came in the way of holding polls to the MCK, its Commissioner filed an appeal before the division bench.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-files-plea-in-hc-over-single-judge-instructions-on-delimitation/article30517640.ece

340,2020/01/09,Why Zakir is an Ustad?,"One is a percussion wizard and the other has a way with strings. The veteran, for the past five decades, has been on a trailblazing rhythm journey, while his 47-year-old collaborator is part of many exciting cross-genre projects and classical ensembles. Both belong to a musical lineage, the tabla ace being the son of the inimitable Ustad Alla Rakha and the sitar virtuoso, of the acclaimed Pt. Kartick Kumar.

So when Ustad Zakir Hussain and Niladri Kumar walk on to the stage (their musical partnership started a few years ago), it is not just the coming together of two musicians or instruments, but two inventive minds. Their concerts go beyond melody and beats; they are lessons in creativity.

“Everytime I perform with Ustadji it is unnerving,” says Niladri. “Because you do not know what to expect. He can make every situation and sound his own. It is up to the co-artistes to understand and emulate his thought along with bringing their imagination into play,” he elaborates.

Sitar exponent Niladri Kumar | Photo Credit: A_M_Faruqui

As a kid, Niladri learnt to count the taals at Ustad’s concerts. “Now I get to sit next to him on stage with the sitar in hand, but the learning continues. He is an extremely generous musician, who does not believe in conventional hierarchy. The Ustad is accomodative of younger artistes and their hopes and dreams. Even as you brace yourself to rise to the challenge of performing with him, he manages to bring the best out of you.”

Known for his creation, Zitar, an electric sitar with five strings, Niladri is not comfortable with the term ‘experimental’. “None of us, who are labelled as innovators, are doing anything new. It is all there in the system. You just have to look deeper at tradition and will be amazed to know the kind of work that legendary artistes have done. We are just carrying forward their vision,” he points out.

Coming back to the experience of interacting and performing with the Ustad, Niladri feels it is not easy to match up to his stature or skill. “He has performed with five generations of musicians. His trajectory is so unique. He has seamlessly been working to make Indian classical part of global collaborations. Thanks to him, we have realised classical does not mean restrictive or inaccessible. His work inspires both the orthodox and the progressive. Ustad has not just widened the rhythm repertoire, he has broadened our perspective,” says Niladri, as he looks forward to perform once again with the master percussionist.

341,2020/01/09,KJ Yesudas: A name that spells melody,"KJ Yesudas’ voice has seeped into the collective conscious of the Malayali, infusing melody into every emotion and mood. For nearly 60 years, he has been regaling music buffs with his mesmerising music, a voice that is every Malayali’s pride. Not a day passes in Kerala without one getting to listen to him somewhere.

Yesudas, Dasettan to his admirers, spanning generations, has worked with the pioneers of the film music industry and the new-gen music directors with equal felicity.

He has witnessed the digitalisation of the music industry and the rise and fall of trends and fads. But that voice has never faltered.

Whether it be in expressing his concern over an issue or an appeal, his is the voice that the Malayali listens to.

As the musician turns 80 today, he continues to insist that he is still a learner, a student eager to drink from the fountain of music.

Friday Review talks to music directors, young and old, who have worked with the legend, using his voice to create some memorable gems that have stood the test of time.

I have always said that no singer can match what a composer has in mind. If there is one singer who, very often, came close to the original creation and, at times, even enhanced it, it is Yesu. No other singer can sing with such bhava, such laya. And his pronunciation is perfect. In the case of other singers there is only one style in which they can be slotted. In Yesu’s case, he can be moulded into any form. The essence of his voice will stay as a diamond even if you chip off the sides.

Those days we spent a lot of time at rehearsals and Yesu used to, very diligently, listen to the music director, his instructions and suggestions and then sing. If he had doubts, he would clear it straight away and then sing the version to be recorded. The magic happened at the recording. I cannot pick one song of mine that Yesu hasn’t chiselled to perfection. He has done complete justice to all my songs. But I still ruminate about listening to his voice singing ‘Chambakathaikal pootha manathe…’ and ‘Paadatha veenayum paadum…’, it was divine. I pray for his health and hope that Yesu will continue to sing for many more years.

Yesudas has a unique voice. When you talk to him, it sounds like a regular voice. But when his voice comes out of a microphone, in a studio, a huge transformation takes place. That voice then paints and creates indelible experiences.

We were born in the same area in West Kochi. I’m elder to him by eight months. My father was a vaidyar (Ayurveda physician) and I have heard that he helped cure Yesudas of a kind of eczema when he was a young boy. That’s all I knew about him then, we had never met.

The first time I met Yesudas was in New York City, sometime in 1978. I had heard a lot about him by then. We got talking and soon recorded eight songs in his voice for a LP record titled ‘Atma Ki Awaz’. The next year, when I came back home and did my first film, Mamatha, Yesudas sang two songs. When I heard his voice through the speakers inside the studio, I was thunderstruck, it was so distinctive.

Since then Yesudas has sung in almost all the films for which I composed. When I made a comeback of sorts after nearly 20 years in Action Hero Biju, the first name that came to my mind was that of Yesudas. He is proven material and his voice is universally accepted. And he did justice to that duet like he did to all my songs. For the duet, ‘Pookkal panineer pookkal’, the orchestra was pre-recorded but Yesudas and Vani Jairam recorded together like in the olden days. I thought Yesudas would suggest that Vani Jairam sing and record first but like a true professional, he understood that a duet must be sung together. He is an all-time favourite of mine.

There hasn’t been anybody like Dasettan and I don’t know whether there can be anyone like him in the future. I first met him during my stint as a teacher at his music school in the capital city in 1975. He used to come in between to take classes in voice modulation and voice control.

I worked in two albums of his recording label, Tharangini, after which I did my first film song with him, ‘Megham poothu thudangi’ (Thoovanathumbikal). The tracks ‘Kannin nin meyyil’ (Innale) and ‘Perariyathoru nombarathe’ (Sneham) also are special.

Here is someone who taught us how to pronounce Malayalam words correctly in the most beautiful way. He could bring out the sweetness of each word. He is a model for all singers. That quality applies to classical music as well. He could bring out the lyrical beauty of each kriti with his rendition and musicality.

He has never stopped learning. His dedication is praiseworthy. He knew what is expected of a particular track, because of his in-depth knowledge about Carnatic music, kritis and nuances of each raga.

I just had to give him a brief of the situation before recording the song and the output has always been what I wanted. In the song, ‘Megham poothu...’ I told him that he had to bring in a feel of the ocean in the first line and he was spot on. As for ‘Perariyathoru nombarathe’, I was not even with him when it was recorded. He sang it in a studio in the US. I had given him the brief that there should be romance but a little pain as well.

However great a composition is, it is important that the song is rendered beautifully. Then that song becomes complete and that has always happened with Dasettan. That's because he found the Divine in music.

I remember those long, hot, sweaty hours inside the Madras [Chennai] studios, playing the violin for so many recordings. In the sweltering summer heat, some of us would take off our shirts as the ‘takes’ went on and on. There was a sense of relief when it was announced that Dasettan was recording. He was like a whiff of cool breeze — someone who came in, rehearsed and completed the recording in one take. He could do this only because he used to rehearse the song on his own, rigorous practice.

For me, who grew up listening and singing Dasettan’s songs, I used to dream of making songs and imagine how Dasettan would sing it. This dream came true. I cannot forget listening to him sing ‘Nee en sarga soundaryame…’, for Kathodu Kathoram, my first independent work.

Composers opted for Dasettan’s voice for various reasons. His voice had the magic to take a song beyond the words and music; there is a soul in his singing; he is so flexible that any genre, any range sits lightly on him; he can enhance the original composition like no other singer and most significantly he has that God-given gift of being able to impart the right amount, the right dose of emotion to the song.

Fact file KJ Yesudas was born on January 10, 1940 in Fort Kochi as son of actor-singer Augustine Joseph and Elizabeth.

He has won the Kerala State Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer a record 23 times. Yesudas has requested the State government not to consider him for future awards to ensure that the younger singers also get a chance.

He has won the Padma Shri (1977), Padma Bhushan (2002) and Padma Vibhushan (2017).

Producer Raman Nambiyath introduced Yesudas as playback singer in the film Kaalpaadukal on November 14, 1961.

He made his début as music director in the film Azhakulla Seleena (1973).

Yesudas established a music company Tharangini in 1980.

He is the only singer to be honoured with the Asthana Gayakan title by the Kerala State.

I’m not sure if Dasettan is a complete technoid. But I do know that he understands the potential of the gadgets used in recording studios today. I remember him asking me to ‘punch in/out’ during those early days of multi-track recordings. If he is not updating his knowhow today, I guess it is because he has focused on other things, like, say, Carnatic music. Dasettan is perhaps the only singer in the world who sings classical and films songs with such ease, such felicity.

I usually sing the tracks for my songs. When Dasettan sang for the film Unnikale Oru Katha Parayam, the title song, the director and producer in the studio kept staring at me. They knew, like I did, that Dasettan was singing it a tad differently from the original. But like my friend Johnson always used to say, when you finally listened to it, you would start humming what Dasettan had rendered, forgetting what we had created. That was the magic. And that song went on to win the National award for him. If Dasettan has achieved all this success, it is not just because of his God-given talent but also because of his hard work.

Dasettan’s voice can paint what our eyes cannot see. He was fortunate to be ‘trained’ by the great composers of Malayalam film music like G Devarajan.

I think I’m blessed to have worked with such a great singer. I owe so much to him because he made my songs immortal. I believe that it is Dasettan’s firm founding in classical music that has helped him retain the quality and texture of his voice even when he is 80 years old.

When Dasettan sings you cannot but listen. Whatever he sings, be it a comic song or one with a strong folk flavour, he does full justice to it. No other singer can do that. Whether it is the high or low octaves, Dasettan sings with such purity, such clarity. It sounds so easy but when you try singing it, you’ll know the difference. Unlike other singers I have felt that Dasettan has no limitations and he is ready to adapt. For the film Veena Poovu, Dasettan sang the evergreen hit ‘Nashta Swargangale Ningalenikkoru…’ and for ‘Kanni maasathile…’ he changed his voice to suit the pulluvan paattu style (indigenous folk song). Even today there are many who do not believe that this song has been sung by Dasettan. He has done that so well. Singers will come and go but even at 80 Dasettan still remains right there, at the zenith.

Dasettan and his voice have been part of my growing up years. So imagine my happiness when I realise that he has sung 80 % of my compositions. Although I have never made a song keeping his voice in mind, once I finish a particular composition I would end up deciding to hear it in his voice. We have had tiffs and arguments — he still scolds me — but I don’t feel bad about it.

The music scene has changed over the years with new composers, new sounds, technology gaining an upper hand and what not. But Dasettan has stood out amidst all this. His brilliance is unmatched and there has been no other singer with such a beautiful tonal quality in voice. That’s what has kept him in good stead for so many decades. I had goosebumps when he first sang for me, ‘Sallaapam kavithayaay...’ from Kshanakkathu. As for ‘Sreeragamo...’ (Pavithram), he took it to a totally different level from what I had envisaged.

I admire him for his discipline, both in his personal and professional life. He keeps a list of his Carnatic recitals, with the date, venue and the kritis he sang. Apparently he doesn’t want to repeat himself. As for his technical know-how, he is updated about everything and uses gadgets as and when needed.

It’s overwhelming to realise that I have done background score for Syamaragam, the last work of the legendary V Dakshinamoorthy, which has the voices of Dasettan’s father, Augustine Joseph, Dasettan, Vijay Yesudas and Vijay’s daughter Ameya.

Das sir is one of the main reasons why I became a singer and composer. I grew up on his songs, many of which have become life-long companions, constants in my life. I still listen to them every day. His voice and music are akin to the life-giving blood in me. It must the same for each Malayali.

He is a composer’s delight. There was always a family relationship with Das sir and I was always ‘Mon’ to him. So, even when I went to him for my first work with him as a music director, it was not just a relationship between a music composer and a singer. He has always been supportive and encouraging.

Prior to each recording, I clarify my doubts with him, ask him many questions and he patiently answers each of my questions. There is an element of mentoring in every recording. Usually, when Das sir is to sing a composition of mine, I sing the track myself and so Das sir knows what I want to be conveyed as soon as he listens to it. One of his biggest strengths is that no matter who the composer is or what genre the song is, he has an uncanny ability to sense what are the signature notes of that composer and tune into the heartbeat of that composition. That is why he is so versatile. Whether it be Ravindra Jain, Salil da, Baburaj, MS Viswanath, Ilayaraja or Devarajan Master, no matter to what age he belongs to, Das sir is easily able to meld into their composition.

His presence is a source of joy for any music lover, especially any Malayali. His songs are expressions of our faith, of romance, of pathos and more. The minute we hear ‘Oru neram enkilam kannathe vayya ente, Guruvayoorappa nin divya roopam...’ , we are transported to Guruvayoor. That is Yesudas.

He is incomparable. In the case of Dasettan, it is his willingness to learn that has humbled me. Even for one note or sangati, he writes the notation of that particular note, discusses that with me, learns it and then renders the song. It is for ‘Adithya kiranangal’, a song in Gunji Kanada, a rare raga, that he won the Kerala State film award for best playback singer (male) in 2015. Even while learning, he told me to sing it for him. Which singer of his stature will take so much of an effort?

From 10 am to 5 pm, we were recording this song. One note was going up and then going down. He wrote down the notation, perfected it and then sang the number. He could have easily sung it the way he wanted to and left. I would not have had a problem. But therein lies in his greatness. He told me ‘Narayanan’s song must be sung the way he has envisaged it. If I don’t do justice to it, my muse will question me’. I don’t think there is any singer in India who can read a composer’s mind like Dasettan. He is the greatest in India. There is no one who has sung so many varieties of songs in so many languages.

I consider myself blessed because Dasettan latest National Award was for a song I had composed, ‘Poi Maranja Kaalam’ for the film Viswasapoorvam Mansoor.

The recording was supposed to take place just after he had been conferred the Padma Vibhushan. Talking to mediapersons soon after that had strained his voice and so he candidly told me that he would do the song after his voice recovered. However, since we had decided the date, he drove two hours to the studio and sang a few notes. As soon as he finished, he told me ‘Narayana, it is best to do this recording afterwards’. I concurred. This was a lesson to me. His honesty and complete dedication to music and his quest for perfection. I consider myself lucky to be a musician at a time when we have someone like Dasettan in our midst, as role model and musician par excellence.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/qfkr3m/article30522912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10TVFKJYESUDASVOCALCONCERT,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/kj-yesudas-turns-80/article30522919.ece
342,2020/01/09,Amritha Murali and her truly classical music,"“Her music is full of gnanam and sukha-bhavam. Technical competency in her singing is presented most aesthetically,” says Bombay Jayashri. Veteran vocalist, and sought-after guru, Suguna Varadachari states, “She is very sincere to the art form and does not veer away to cater to the gallery.”

Amritha Murali has received numerous titles and awards from all the leading sabhas, including the Outstanding Vocalist Award several times from The Music Academy and the Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar from the Sangeet Natak Akademi. Senior mridangist K. Arunprakash states: “Amritha stays true to the Carnatic format. Her sruti suddham is admirable — regardless of what she sings or at what speed, every note will be perfectly aligned to the sruti. Also, she does not rest on her laurels and keeps working to improve an already excellent skillset.” Suguna Varadachari adds, “In addition to all these, she continues to be humble — an important but rare quality.”

Currently under the guidance of P.S. Narayanaswamy (PSN) and R.K. Shriramkumar, Amritha was initiated into music at age nine by her maternal grandmother, Shankari Nagarajan. Tutelage followed under K.R. Kedaranathan and his wife, Meera Kedaranathan. She also concurrently started learning the violin under Vittal Ramamurthy, who taught her all the basic lessons, some varnams and kritis. Later, she joined veteran T. Rukmini for advanced violin training. From Rama Ravi she learnt some exquisite compositions in the Dhanammal bani.

Amritha’s progress was very fast so much so that Kedaranathan chose her, at age 12, to notate and transcribe (sometimes for hours together) the many compositions he tuned, on the spot, as he sung it. As a result, she can learn any piece from notation without difficulty. Amritha recalls many an occasion when she would change in school, grab a bite to eat in the car and head to class whose duration was unpredictable. No excuses could be given citing homework or examinations. As was typical of senior practitioners, there was no hand-holding and lot of the learning was from listening. Her musical acumen gained a great deal from this rigorous regimen.

Amritha is the first in her family to have taken up music full time although everyone was exposed to the art. Her parents and gurus have all been matter-of-fact without engaging in high praise, which, according to her, helped. “I constantly introspect and question myself as to how I am singing and how it can be bettered.” Despite preferring Science in high school, she decided on the commerce stream to have more time for music. She participated in many competitions which enriched her repertoire.

Amritha recalls performing at M.S. Subbulakshmi’s house when she was 13, along with Meera Kedaranathan, Seetha Rajan, Lakshmi Krishnaswamy, Sangeetha Sivakumar and Padma Sugavanam. “That was a truly memorable occasion,” she says. She explains how Meera Kedaranathan could make any person sing to tune and to talam. “Mami truly believed anyone could sing. She would repeat a line patiently as many times as needed .”

The Kedaranathans conducted an annual Thyagaraja Utsavam where, in 1997, Amritha sang ‘Dhyaname’ in Dhanyasi. Hearing that rendition, S.V. Krishnan insisted that Amritha perform during the season for Nada Inbam. Amritha thus gave her first concert at the age of 15 at Raga Sudha Hall on December 15, 1997. This was quickly followed in 1998 by a concert for the Semmangudi Trust and her maiden violin programme for VDS Arts Academy, where she played for Kunnukudi Balamuralikrishna.

“It has been inspiring to learn from PSN mama in the tradition of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. Sarvalaghu swaras would flow seamlessly in any raga when he sang. I have learned many precious kritis from him. Rukmini mami is a stickler for detail and perfection. She would ensure that whatever we played would sound like how we would sing it. Her simplicity and child-like nature are lessons in humility,” says Amritha. She received a Sangeet Natak Akademi fellowship to study advanced Ragam Thanam Pallavi under B. Krishnamoorthy.

Listening is a key part of growth in music. Besides old masters on recordings, even as a young girl, her mother would drop Amritha off at concerts and pick her up just before 8 p.m. “I always slept at 8 wherever I was – it was automatic. Until then, I would note down each piece that was sung and, in the case of a Pallavi, I would notate it and write down the sahityam.” This, she says, gave her valuable insight into how concerts were planned. She enrolled for three Master’s degree courses but music having become a priority, finished only one – in Finance Management.

Amritha was very active in the Youth Association for Classical Music (YACM), where she also served as vice president. She got to interact with, and listen to, many of the senior star musicians of today who were the pioneers of the youth movement then. “I got exposed to so much variety in musical styles — there is something to absorb from each person. Hearing about their own learning experiences too was most illuminating.” As part of the YACM Millennium show, with Vijay Siva, she went to several city schools and trained 500 children to sing ‘Maithreem Bhajata’ at the stroke of midnight. An introvert, along the way, Amritha shed her shyness and inhibition. It would not be appropriate to call her a ‘violinist turned vocalist.’ She has always been both. She has accompanied a plethora of leading artistes and played many duet concerts with T. Rukmini.

“Learning from R.K. Shriramkumar brought freshness and contemplation into my music,” says Amritha. It is not often that a guru accompanies sishyas, but he is one such rare individual. “His presence inspires but never intimidates. There are imperceptible things he does — like settling an odd kalapramanam with a single bow or gently stressing a note, if speeding up. The learning continues on stage, enhancing the spontaneity in my manodharma.”

Amritha’s music is striking for the emotion she conveys. “Initially, we strive for correctness. But there is a level beyond that. The ragam itself takes over. I have been sensing this over past few years. It often feels as though it is just the music and me. It is now an experience.” Amritha is a stickler for singing the songs exactly as taught. “If I have forgotten compositions, I relearn them. I prefer not to mess with the rendering.” She is an integral part of Shriramkumar’s ensemble performances with his students, often on specific themes. Amritha has also provided the vocals for many of Gowri Ramnarayan’s contemporary theatre and thematic performances. She has participated in several workshops and lecture demonstrations for SPIC-MACAY and other organisations.

The gender issue? It exists, but Amritha chooses to focus on the positives — that there are many who willingly play with no regard to gender. She also says that many sabhas select artistes purely on merit.

Amritha also teaches and some of her students have won prizes at music competitions. She is kind with her pupils whilst uncompromising in imparting chaste music. She explains the importance of sarva lagu swarams over kanakku. “It is crucial to get the flow. To remove the anxiety, I often ask them to initially just sing with the appropriate ending note but without worrying about the ‘eduppu.’ Then, I focus on bringing it into the actual tala structure. This way, it is more gradual and seems less onerous.”

Amritha has toured many countries and her first trip to Cleveland in 2007 remains unforgettable for her. “I played for T.K. Govinda Rao Sir and Sowmya akka and it was Vellore Ramabhadran Sir on the mridangam for both concerts.” Other memorable occasions are her first concert with T. Rukmini, accompanied by Shriramkumar and Arunprakash at Shanmukhananda, Mumbai, on MS Subbulakshmi’s birthday, her first Music Academy concert and singing in the presence of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer for a scholarship.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/e3e70g/article30522692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FRAMRITHA2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/amritha-murali-and-her-truly-classical-music/article30522694.ece
343,2020/01/09,Veena Venkatramani: Concert sans gimmick,"Watching young Veena Venkataramani on the frets gives one the hope that the appeal for the instrument has risen in the current scenario.

When she was nine, Veena started learning the veena from A. Champakavalli, and then from her guru’s prime disciple, Jayasri Jayaraj Krishnan.

Veena is conscious of the fact that subtleties of sound play a vital role in the instrument. Throughout the two-hour recital, she never resorted to the thrill factor through vigourous meetus.

Meditative Kiravani

In the gamaka-filled elaboration of Kiravani, she brought forth all the features of the Melakarta raga, highlighting its meditative and devotional appeal. In the tanam, she was at her best. The ‘Pakkasaranais’ vibrated with perfect resonance.

She rendered Saint Tyagaraja’s masterpiece ‘Kaligiyunte’ with an admirable sense of proportion in an apposite kalapramanam. The niraval and extensive kalpanaswaras were at ‘Bhaguga Sri Raghuramuni.’

B.S. Prasanth, disciple of Patri Satish Kumar, and K. Ranganathan (ghatam), disciple of Chromepet Suresh and Ghatam Karthick provided an eloquent thani. Prasanth’s support on the percussion, throughout the concert, was gentle. Prasanth allowed the ghatam to take over in the first section of the charanam in every kriti which is laudable.

The Tyagaraja kriti on Mother Tulasi, ‘Amma Ravamma’ (Khanda chapu) was preceded by a melodious, serene delineation of Kalyani. The niraval and swaraprasthara were at the usual ‘Tamarasa Dala Netrudu.’ The swara kuraippu was attractive.

Veena’s selection of songs was remarkable. Commencing with the Kedaragowla varnam, she rendered ‘Vinayaka Ninnuvina’ (Hamsadhwani), with swaras at pallavi. She rendered a crisp swaraprastara for Tyagaraja’s Jaganmohini kriti, ‘Sobillu saptaswara,’ in addition to the popular chittaswara. Dikshitar’s ‘Santhana Gopalakrishnam’ (Khamas-Rupakam), with its crisp madhyamakala segment was a straight presentation. So was ‘Niravadhi sukhada’ (Tyagaraja-Ravichandrika) with its evergreen chittaswara.

Veena concluded her morning concert with ‘Adum Chidambaramo’ (Gopalakrishna Bharathi- Behag) and the Madhuvanti tillana of Lalgudi. There was a time when vainikas used to sing throughout the concert. Veena sang the pallavi of every kriti that she played, which made the whole exercise an enjoyable one for the rasikas.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/wwl9ux/article30522472.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FRVEENAVENKATRAMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/veena-venkatramani-concert-sans-gimmick/article30522473.ece
344,2020/01/09,Rich array of songs on the veena by Nithyasree,"It is good to see many instrumental kutcheris featured at the City’s sabhas this season. Chennai Fine Arts at Srinivasa Sastri Hall at Mylapore, featured Dr. Nithyasree’s veena recital in the afternoon. A doctorate in music, Nithyasree is a student of Kalyani Ganesan and is being guided by Chitravina Ganesh. Nithayasree’s selection of ragas was impressive so was the array of compositions — Sriranjani, Sahana, Ritigowla, Purvikalyani, Kuntalavaralai, Kiravani, Behag and Nadanamakriya. All these ragas are high on melody and suit the veena.

Nithyasree chose Kiravani for her RTP. The raga treatise conveyed the special charm of Kiravani and the tanam that followed was quite gentle. One cannot but feel that it could have been a bit more dynamic as tanam is the major attraction of veena. The pallavi set in Adi tala was ‘Eswari maheswari parameswari ennai aadari’. After the pallavi, Nithyasree played it in gana ragas such as Nattai, Gowla, Arabi, Varali and Sri to project the flexibility of the lyrics to suit any raga. After the niraval and the mandatory trikalam, the swaraprasthara in Kiravani was a bit controlled.

Nithyasree dealt with Purvikalyani raga essay for ‘Jnanamosaga rada’ of Tyagaraja. Her niraval and swaras on ‘Paramathmudu’ were brisk.

The other notable pieces were ‘Brocheva revare’ in Sriranjani (Tyagaraja), ‘Vandanamu’ in Sahana (Tyagaraja), ‘Bogindrasayeenam’ in Kuntalavarali (Swati Tirunal), ‘Muruganin maru peyar’ in Behag (Guru Surajananda) and ‘Navagraha vanor’ in Nadanamakriya (P.N. Muralidharan).

Thillaisthanam Suryanaryanan on the mridangam and Nanganallur Swaminathan on the ghatam supported the vainika with care. They also added an expressive ‘thani’ appropriate to the duration of the concert.

Nithyasree sang the pallavi in her RTP which helped gather the necessary inforamtion about the composition. Her veena playing carries ‘gamakam’ as well as vinayam’ (humility). Yet, it is not a bad idea that she gives more ‘gambiram’ (majesty) to raga expositions and swaraprastharas.

Correction

In the review, ‘Need to pack more energy’ (FR, January 3), the song Bhavya Hari rendered was ‘Mathangi’ of Muthuswami Dikshitar in raga Ramamanohari and not ‘Korina Varamu.’ The error is regretted.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/gpq1w8/article30522409.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FRNITHYASREE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/rich-array-of-songs-on-the-veena-by-nithyasree/article30522410.ece
345,2020/01/09,Dolls and strings,"Anupama Hoskere, founder of Dhaatu, an organisation that works to revive the traditional art form of puppetry, bagged the Central Sangeet Natak Akademi Puraskar for Puppetry this year. Ahead of the Dhaatu International Puppet Festival on January 3, 4 and 5, Anupama says all her efforts to see the revival of folklore was worth it for the genre. But did she ever expect a national award? “Not in my wildest dreams,” she says feeling happy that it was time puppetry was recognised.

Anupama holds a Masters in Computers with a fellowship in puppetry, and had a childhood growing up with dolls. With a passion for traditions, texts and scriptures, she got guidance from veterans like MR Ranganth Rao who taught her to create puppets. The intention of initiating ‘Dhaatu’ for Anupama and her husband Vidyashankar Hoskere is to “fill the gap for introducing traditional arts,” with captivating stories told through epics and mythological accounts of inspiring personalities. Anupama, who scripts the storyline, creates the puppets and directs her puppet shows, shared the highlights of her journey and the Dhaatu Fest in an interview with The Hindu-Metroplus.

Excerpts...

Your recent 20-city tour to the US would prove how relevant and demanding Indian puppetry still is to global audiences

We took Mahakavi Kalidasa's Maalavikaagnimitram our latest production - a puppet and dance musical on this tour. The fulfilling experience had me travel with my team of five members and 17 suitcases of puppets and props across the US to perform for audiences who were enthralled. The common response throughout was ‘We did not know such an art form existed in India. It is so beautiful and rich.’ We did this to have the proceeds reach a child’s program for educating 3000 BPL children in India.

What was the main intention behind starting Dhaatu in 2004, and the Dhaatu puppet fest in 2009?

The main duty of puppetry or any performance arts in India is entertainment. The other layers are part of the responsibility of the puppeteer. In 2009, I realised that Bengaluru had not witnessed a puppet festival for 21 years! People hadn’t exactly seen what puppetry was, or how useful it can be as part of our cherished arts. In order to introduce this great medium of entertainment into their lives, we started the Dhaatu Puppet Festival in 2009. This was a State level festival.

Between your first production Harishchandra and the last one Maalavikaagnimitram you would have seen a lot of changes?

Before Harishchandra we had performed two shows - Shoorpanakha and Nala Damayanthi for which my puppet teacher MR Ranganatha Rao made the puppets. These were puppets which did not have legs but had excellent control of hands, akin to what was used in the Mysore region, known as Moodalapaya Yakshagana. Later I preferred dolls with legs for dimensional movement. I researched and found that Karnataka string puppets did at some time feature puppets with legs. The next few months I shut myself to recreate these puppets. Dhaatu's first complete production Harishchandra emerged in 2004 with puppets which had legs and could walk. We are walking down memory lane in this puppet festival and having this production for the inaugural on January 3, 6-30pm.

This research also led me to discover the Bhagavatha Shailee puppets of Eachanoor in the Mysore folklore museum. Along with that there were puppets of Dharwad and Ranibennur. The puppets of the Bhagavata Shailee were very beautiful and sophisticated. This is when I applied for the senior fellowship in puppetry from the Ministry of Culture, New Delhi and was awarded the same in 2009. The result of all this was the emergence of the Dhaatu Puppet Productions one after the other - Rajasuya Yaga, Ashtavakra, Bhakta Prahlada, Vijayanagara Vaibhava, Sri Krishna Parijatas to name a few. Aabharana - was devised as a jugalbandhi between a Bharatanatyam dancer, Divya Hoskere and puppet Jatti Tayamma, where puppets of Karnataka render pretty much any classical tale of India.

I am dreaming of making Ramayana Saptaswara - a puppet production in seven languages integrating Bharata just as Shreeramachandra did so with his marriage to the princess of Mithila and later with his journey on foot from Ayodhya to the southern most tip of the nation.

What are the highlights of the upcoming puppet fest this year?

The tagline this year is puppets and control systems. In India, there has been the continuous design of control systems in puppetry. The Dhaatu International Puppet Festival 2020 is having a conference on Puppets and Control systems. There is a beautiful combination of string and rod controls which are used alternatively by the puppeteers of Ranibennur. People can watch their show at the festival.

Masks are the cousins of puppetry. We have a parade of masks and puppets of the world and also masks from upcoming mask-makers of Banashankari itself where people can take part on January 3, 3-30pm from Dhaatu Puppet Bus-stop, KR Road to JSS Auditorium, Jayanagar. We also have a workshop from the visiting artists at the festival.

Where does India stand in practicing puppetry?

India is the motherland of puppetry with the largest variety of puppets that have grown independently reflecting the cultures of each region. They are beautiful in design, adorned and costumed. They tell stories that entertain at the outset but are layered with stories to give the wisdom of life. Indian puppetry excels in putting up full-fledged Natakas which have dialogue, music, dancing and background work suitable for all audiences. Western puppetry is deeply invested in its design systems and its reflections on realism. Egypt, Italy and Myanmar puppeteers would be part of Dhaatu fest this year.

We hear all your dolls are hand-made?

I have made nearly 600 puppets in wood (with Aale mara or bombax cotton, and neem) to realise my dreams in several productions, as we have 24 performances in a year. The dolls are painstakingly carved and assembled with strings and decorated with foil work and elaborate jewellery including puppets with eyeball movement, puppets with eyelid movement, dancer puppet which can do Bharatanatyam steps. The process of making them gives me an emotional connect, but has taught me to gain more patience. It is also fulfilling to have a supportive family and a Dhaatu team with Mythily, Chitra and Srivatsa enabling to construct the genre for people to appreciate. I am grateful to Sanskrit scholar and poet Dr. Shatavadhani R. Ganesh who supports us with lyrics and along with Dr. SR Leela.

346,2020/01/09,Bharati Ramasubban — rendition shorn of frills,"Bharathi Ramasubban played to her strengths which lay in sober classical fare shorn of frills and flounces. ‘Pahi Sri Girirajasuthe’ (Ananda Bhairavi, Syama Sastri) was complemented by a free-flowing chittaiswaram.

Woven at leisure, the Purvikalyani alapana, with karvai rests at the madhya sthayi panchama and bhava-filled prayogas at tara sthayi rishabha, was buttressed by solid pidis. Graceful jarus in the concluding verses of the Thiruvembavai ‘Moiyyaar Thadam’ captured the raga’s essence. Kizhkala kalpanaswara took the sarvalaghu route — the truly relaxed kind that eschewed studied effect. Melkala swaras saw the vocalist in her element, the fluency gathering momentum with janta swaras and excellent mridangam support.

Eminently suited to the artiste’s approach was the gamaka-rich standalone kriti, ‘Sri Ramam Ravi Kulabdhi Somam’ (Muthuswami Dikshitar, Narayanagowla). ‘Sri Maanini’ (Tyagaraja, Poornashadjam) injected the much-needed contrasting note of briskness.

Impressive alapana

The artiste embarked on Sankarabharanam, the main raga, with a robustness that quickened the pulse, in a departure from the anticipated meditative approach. Sancharas balanced on the madhyama-dhurita kala cusp built solid constructs. Voice gained sheen at the tara sthayi shadja, enlivened by a select edition of brigas. Rather than dwelling on any particular suite, the alapana fanned out in an overview.

Fluid traverses and pivotal pidis helped the violinist, Thirumarugal S. Dinesh Kumar to build a raga essay of worth, his deft fingering and focus on key facets illuminating a well-phased development. A comfortably-paced ‘Enduku Peddala’ (Tyagaraja) with its sahitya-filled matrix, lessened voice strain. Niraval at ‘Veda Sastra,’ kizhkala sarvalaghu swaras and melkala swaras centred at the panchama in kuraippu, with catchy kanakkus. highlighted attractive shades.

In the Varali RTP, time-tested prayogas radiating from the panchama contributed to a non-showy, well-grounded raga exposition. Tanam was sung with involvement.

Dinesh Kumar scored with his sensitive highlighting of the raga’s hallmark plaintive madhyama in a close-knit web of prayogas. The pallavi lyrics ‘Vidhu Shobitha...’ were set to Khanda Triputa tala, duly rounded off with ragamalika swaras, anuloma and viloma. ‘Sindhu Tarana’ (Sindhu Bhairavi) brought the recital to a fitting close.

Mandapaka Nagalakshmi (mridangam) was a pillar of support and aired a thani avartanam that combined subtlety with puissance.

With voice appearing to be constricted by the vagaries of the December weather, Bharathi navigated octaves and sancharas with a strain-minimising choice of ragas and compositions. The artiste placed her faith in compositional strength, wisely bolstering the programme with several kritis. However, an undercurrent of anxiety that surfaced in segments and occasional over-oscillation of gamakas, stood in the way of achieving calmness at the core.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bu7e6n/article30522338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FRBHARATHIRAMASUBBANMUSICACADEMY1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bharati-ramasubban-rendition-shorn-of-frills/article30522339.ece
347,2020/01/09,‘Srikantan’s music is ageless’,"The centenary celebration is an apt occasion to talk to T.S. Satyavathi, musician and musicologist. “Completeness marked every aspect of his music, which can also be termed shastra-bhaddha. As his disciple of nearly four decades, it was a pleasure to flag off the ‘R.K. Srikantan Centenary Celebrations’ by speaking about him at the Music Academy in Chennai recently,” said Satyavathi before settling down for this interview. She will be showcasing Srikantan on several platforms across the country during the year.

As a student of R.K. Srikantan if there is one aspect that you will always take along, what would that be?

To be a learner forever.

Among his personal traits, what made the most impact?

A strict disciplinarian, he would brook no laxity on the part of his students. He was working with All India Radio, where every second counted, and that was the kind of time-sense he dictated.

He was steeped in tradition but RKS welcomed new features. Did he not?

It was always creativity within the frame of tradition. His alapanas were firmly grounded in the compositions which were structured, ‘Nibaddha.’ One cannot take liberties with the Sangatis here. With due respect to the musical vision of the composer, one may improvise it with one or two judicious inclusions. To this extent, you may call him orthodox but when it comes to the elaboration of a raga, niraval, i.e. to say, ‘Anibaddha’ or non-structured, semi-structured aspects, creativity flowed, exuding a natural freshness.

His focus on sruti-bhaddhate while teaching...

He strongly believed in ‘Shruti Maata and Layaha Pita.’ This could very easily be felt when he held on to the aadhaara shadja, the basic Sa, before he began a concert. The entire hall would seem to resonate with it.

About his rich bank of kritis... was he possessive?

There is something that I can never forget in this regard. I had to change two buses to reach his home and that took me an hour in the late 1970s. On my request, he taught me a rare composition of Tyagaraja ‘Devi Shri Tulasamma’ in Mayamalavagowla before which he strictly instructed me to not share it with anyone. Observing my puzzled look he said, “Do you know, how much I laboured to get this lyric?” I made at least 50 bicycle trips to the vidwan, who was reluctant to part with it. Your efforts are no mean in coming all the way from Jayanagar and learning and practising. I don’t want it to fall into wrong hands who might insult the composition.” At that moment it appeared to be possessiveness but later on I realised that it was born out of his concern to preserve authenticity. On the other hand, there have been instances when he would teach me two compositions in a single session and ask me to pass them on to my students as well!

T.S. Satyavathi

What do you think RKS expected most from his students as a performer?

Attention to be paid to every aspect such as sruti alignment, appropriate use of gamakas in a raga, unwavering laya, clear diction — all of this wrapped in bhava. In a kutcheri, it was imperative to take note of the occasion, duration, the kind of audience and accompanists before finalising the fare. The list must have variety in raga, tala and composers. Of course, rigorous practice and internalisation.

He never believed that music was an intellectual exercise...

It was never an intellectual exercise, but an emotional one. Music should not incite, but invoke insights. Today’s music is about technique, intellect and loud volume. When Sastra is implicit, automatically your emotions will be explicit. Your singing should not expose your Sastra, believed my guru Srikantan. You must absorb the technique and allow it to be processed through your bhava. But today even the rasikas want the brain to rule as they seem to want loudness and display.

Many accompanying musicians talk of his stage simplicities and the 'connect' he brought about

Yes, that stemmed out of his thorough understanding of the various requirements on stage, including the kind of accompanying artistes. He would neither embarrass nor get embarrassed by anyone. It would be a joint celebration of music all through.

Do you think he lived at the right time to take his beliefs across?

RKS’ music is ‘ageless’ because it combines in itself all of which is appreciated by the young and the old, learner and the learned, Indian and alien listeners. There is always something for everyone to admire and emulate.

RKS continues to score thanks to his sishyas, a brand that he has developed. He got hundreds of them through his Ganavihara on Akashavani ...

My guru was extremely selective in picking his students. AIR did give wide publicity to his impeccable teaching skills through ‘Ganavihara.’ Thousands have benefited by this. It was a privilege to learn even if it was just one composition. He remains Guru par excellence to us and we surely miss his physical presence.

Centenary celebration

Vidwan R.K. Srikantan Trust in association with Academy of Music, Ministry of Culture, Government of India and department of Kannada and Culture, Government of Karnataka is celebrating the Trust’s 25th Sankaranti Music festival as a commemoration of the birth centenary of Srikantan and Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar.

348,2020/01/09,Manda Sudharani’s concert was engaging and erudite,"Manda Sudharani’s vocal recital stood out for sheer diligence and musical excellence. Though the voice played truant in the beginning, she managed to bring it under control as the concert progressed. Two major offerings need special mention — Kharaharapriya and RTP in Hamsavinodhini. A discerning listener could identify the way Sudharani developed a raga with an eye on the nuances and devised the swarakalpana with interesting swara matrices.

Kharaharapriya was structured quite leisurely and her choice was Tyagaraja’s ‘Nadachi nadachi’. The extension and swaraprasthara were taken up on the anupallavi line ‘Pudamisuta sahayudai.’ Her swara suite was not built up frantically, but care was taken to structure every strand differently. Ranjani Ramakrishnan on the violin expertly resonated the vocalist.

Well-planned RTP

The RTP was once again a well-planned journey. Sudharani chose to showcase a rather rare raga like Hamsavinodhini in detail. Here also Ranjani followed Sudharani in a commendable manner. After the tanam, the pallavi went as ‘Samagana swaroopini vani hamsavinodhini ambuja lochani.’ The swara section was well-knitted. The finale centered on ‘gandharam’ brought a deserving applause. Sudharani later explained that the syllables of each word in the pallavi, composed by her, was set in a count of 5. If she had mentioned this before rendering the pallavi, the audience could have enjoyed it more.

She even did a ‘grahabedam’ and switched over to Sunadha Vinodhini, including the name of the raga at that moment.

The other thoughtful additions were ‘Sarasooda’, and ‘Vallabha nayakasya’ (Muthuswami Dikshitar), a neat and precise essay of Gamanashrama (53rd Mela raga) followed by ‘Idi neeku nyaayama’ (Mysore Vasudevachar), ‘Kamala dalayatha lochana mulave’ in Bahudari (Dr. Balamuralikrishna), ‘Sri guruna palitosmi’ in Padi (Dikshitar) and the concluding, ‘Madhava mamava’ in Nilambari (Narayana Tirtar).

D.S.R. Murthy and G. Ravichandran on the mridangam and the ghatam bolstered the quality of the concert in every way. Their tani avartanam was framed and presented with sobriety. Manda Sudharani deserves appreciation for presenting an engaging and erudite recital.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/85n2p5/article30522319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FRMANDASUDHARANI,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/manda-sudharanis-concert-was-engaging-and-erudite/article30522320.ece
349,2020/01/09,Grand display of classicism by Vijay Siva,"In the Western world, each genre of music is preserved almost in its entirety. Thus symphonies do not have elements of jazz or pop. Likewise, literary works of Shakespeare or Ilango Adigal (author of Silappadikaram) are not meddled with. So it sounds odd to say that someone presented a Carnatic concert in a classical style! And that lot is endangered. Vijay Siva is one who takes extreme care to shun ill-fitting corruption of our music. His concert for Parthasarathy Swami Sabha was a grand exhibition of classicism — I squirm having to use the term.

Vijay Siva’s programme was sound but that does not reveal the execution specifics which underline the success of the concert. For those interested in the list, here is a partial one – ‘Chalamela’ (Darbar varnam), ‘Saketa nagara’ (Harikhambodi, Sadasiva Rao), ‘Sri Sundararajam’ (Pantuvarali, Dikshitar), ‘Enduku dayaradura’ (Thodi, Tyagaraja), ‘Sari Evvare’ (Sahana, Tirupati Narayanaswami), ‘Devi brova’ (Chintamani, Syama Sastri), ‘Kamakshi’ (Bilahari, Dikshitar) and an RTP in Anandabhairavi.

Short and sweet varnam

The way every song was rendered served a distinct purpose. The warm-up varnam, short and sweet, the early ‘Saketa nagara’ offering brisk pace and travel through higher notes, embellished with a niraval at ‘Rajitha Amarapala’ and the quintessential concert electrifier, Pantuvarali/Kasiramakriya, all turned on the gloss. There were several teaching moments for youngsters as well — Kalapramanam of ‘Sri Sundararajam,’ for example. It was a mid-way speed ensuring a tight concert beat.

Vijay’s Thodi alapana lasted about five minutes and was another lesson on capsuling a vast scope with choicest pickings. His repertoire took him to explore other composers such as Syama Sastri (Devi brova) and Tirupati Narayanaswami (Sari evvare in Sahana) and Andal’s Tiruppavai (Koodaarai vellum).

Another lesson in time management was on offer by Vijay’s approach of not appending niraval and swaram for all key songs. Swaram for Pantuvarali and niraval in Thodi at ‘Tyagarajavinutha’ were worthy ways to do justice to manodharmam without an overload.

Traversing 2 ½ octaves, Vijay Siva’s Bilahari had a characteristic flavour. R.K. Shriramkumar’s raga essay packed in a lot of bhavam. A Dikshitar kriti interpretation is a lesson by itself and Vijay’s effort was one, preferring only well-honed non-briga sangathis. ‘Kamakale vimale’ is a rare spot for the niraval but such is Dikshitar’s dense raga embroidery that you can virtually choose any spot in a song. The Pallavi in Anandabhairavi “Kamalavadane, Kamala dala nayane” in Misra tripudai was just more than a teaser but brought the team into a dynamic mode. Shriramkumar has a fine internalisation of kritis and his support was a key to the concert results.

Veteran Tiruchi Sankaran enjoyed the perky madhyama kalam, demonstrating finger works that would be envy of people half his age. The on-stage relationship among co-percussionists is often a matter of muted but tense scrutiny. Sankaran probably is an exception to the rule. He guided, appreciated and combined well with Anirudh Athreya for an engaging tani avarthanam. Take a bow, all those upholding classicism!",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bn7hej/article30522287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FRVIJAYSIVA1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/grand-display-of-classicism-by-vijay-siva/article30522288.ece
350,2020/01/09,Dr. L Subramaniam and Kavita Krishnamurthy present a stirring musical dialogue,"The 29th edition of the Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival (LGMF), presented as a ‘Tribute to the Mahatma’, featured Dr. L Subramaniam and Kavita Krishnamurthy along with the Castile and Leon Symphony Orchestra from Spain, at the Siri Fort auditorium. The evening opened with two superb solo performances by the orchestra, comprising woods-winds such as flute, oboe, clarinet and strings like violin, viola, and cello.

It felt like an breeze of talent, gift and presence, energising the whole ambience with their opening piece “J. Turina”, followed by the “Spring Rhapsody”, composed by Dr. L. Subramaniam. Later, they accompanied Subramaniam and Kavita Krishnamurthy, presenting ‘Raghupati Raghav…..’, the favourite Ram-dhun of Bapu that created the most serene atmosphere.

Kavita also sang the Narsi Mehta Bhajan ‘Vaishnav jana toh…’, another favourite of the Mahatma. This was surprisingly not in the popular Khamaj based tune but in Kirwani to suit the splendid Orchestra accompanying her. She concluded with a self composed Meera Bhajan “Jo tum todo…”, arranged for the Orchestra by Dr. Subramaniam, that added the sumptuous ‘bharaav’, a pliant resilience, to the bhajan.

“Spring Rhapsody” was a classical contemporary composition where the raga-based Western classical Harmony with complex rhythmic structures, sounded like a perfect blend, creating global musical exchange and dialogue.

The Western harmony based on Indian ragas like Shiva-Ranjani and Kirwani with the changing rhythm in time signature 5/4 changing to 4/4, 3/4, etc, sounded like varied rhythmic cycles of Indian tala system. This composition was written in three movements – Rubato, Rubato Espressivo and Allegro. Starting with a solo flute section, it had trade-offs between different Orchestral instruments ending with a rhythmic motif repeated three times, like a Tihai.

The evening reached its climax with ‘Nada Priya’, composed by Dr L. Subramaniam for violin solo, Indian percussions (mridangam by Mahesh Krishnamurthy, kanjira by Ganamurthy, morsing by Sayasai and tabla by Tanmay Bose), wood-winds and strings.

Here again the raga-harmony was based on ragas like Kanakangi and rhythmically interesting time signatures of 7,8 alternating 3,4 changing to 6,8 and 12,8; that truly inspired the Indian percussionists.

The viola section was based on raga Vakulabharanam where the improvisation was further developed by the violin soloist and joined by the entire orchestra towards the end. The third and concluding movement was based on raga Shuddha Saveri, with quick changes in time signatures creating an awesome rhythmic cadence.

The IIC Winter Festival

Sharada Mushti

The India International Centre showcases young talents with remarkable potential during their annual Winter Festival, but they deserve extra credit to open the festival this year with a Rudra veena recital by a young and upcoming artiste who has dared to opt for this rare and fast disappearing ancient Indian instrument that belongs to the endangered species of Indian string instruments nowadays. The IIC featured Sharada Mushti on Rudra Veena and Hindustani vocalist Adarsh Saxena from Dehradun, at the C.D. Deshmukh auditorium.

Sharada Mushti, one amongst just a handful practitioners of Rudra Veena today, is a talented disciple of Pt. Arvind Parikh, the doyen of Imdadkhani Gharana. Guided in dhrupad style under Shri Rajiv Janardan, Sharada chose the melodious evening Raga Yaman and displayed admirable restraint in her unhurried rendering of the Alap-Jod-Jhala before she played a medium tempo dhrupad composition set to Chautala.

Meditative meend

The very first stroke, a meditative meend of just one swara from nishad to shadja, captured the attention of discerning audience. Elaborating the raga in mandra and ati-mandra octaves, she proceeded towards the madhya and taar saptak, weaving anticipatory web around each progressive swara. The magic of meend continued in jod and jhala too.

Seemingly not so sure of rhythm, Sharada was ably accompanied on pakhawaj by Sukhad Munde, who mirrored her rhythmic patterns in a variety of chhandas in chautala.

Adarsh Saxena is a post graduate in music from Indira Kala Vishwa-Vidyalaya, groomed as the ITC-SRA scholar, under Pt. Arun Bhaduri in Kolkata.

Opening with raga Bihag, he presented the bada Khayal “Kaise sukh sove..”, set to vilambit Ek-tala, elaborating the raga with barhat, behelawa and a variety of sargam and akar taans.

The rhythmically fascinating chhota khayal had its mukhda starting from the 5th beat of Teentala. Adarsh also presented a Jhaptala and Teentala composition of Pt. Arun Bhaduri and Pt. Jnanprakash Ghosh in raga Jog before concluding his vocal recital with a Bhairavi Bhajan.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/69mm54/article30521931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dr-L-Subramanium-and-Kavita-Krishnamurti-at-LGMF-2020,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/dr-l-subramaniam-and-kavita-krishnamurthy-present-a-stirring-musical-dialogue/article30521933.ece
351,2020/01/09,What’s in a gharana?,"Several delightfully different Khayal schools emerged out of many insignificant towns of North India. These schools are popularly known as gharanas, a word deriving out of ghar or house. Intriguingly, each gharana is associated with a particular town; and not the master of the house.

Pandit Vijay Kichlu

Pandits Vijay Kichlu and Ajoy Chakrabarty, who will be participating in ‘Khayal and Gharanas’ a seminar at the National Centre for Performing Arts at Mumbai on January 18-19, try to put the conundrum in perspective.

The duo with Kaushiki Chakrabarty

Edited excerpts:

Why are Khayal gharanas named after cities?

VK: Because the ‘ghar’ belonged to the States where musicians lived and the real masters were the rulers of the States. As patrons of music, they offered salary, housed their chosen musician and looked after their needs. Apart from being court musicians these erudite musicians groomed the inmates of their homes that also included a few dedicated disciples. That is how the word ‘gharana’ (pertaining to house) got associated with the ‘music of the State’; the preceptors chose to remain incognito behind Rampur, Maihar, Agra, Gwalior, etc.

The Qawwal Bacche hailed from Lucknow; then why do we accept Gwalior as Khayal’s Pitri (parent) gharana?

VK: Qawwal Bacche shifted base to Gwalior because their music was greatly appreciated in Gwalior State. Makkhan Khan’s son Natthan Pir Baksh nurtured this new trend of music. His son was Kadir Baksh whose sons Haddu and Hassu Khan took this gayaki to greater heights. Unfortunately Haddu Khan died young; Hassu Khan preferred to groom numerous Brahmins of the region such as Vasudev Joshi, Balkrishnabuwa Ichalkaranjikar and several others. His logic was simple. He wished to be remembered as the Ustad of this new style which was scoffed at by other well-established Ustads of dhrupad. Legend has it that Hassu Khan’s debut khayal recital was a flop in Bengal. He had to woo his listeners back with dhrupad, the popular genre of that era ruled by Vishnupur Gharana.

How did Gharanas evolve?

AC: In their comfortable cocoons, almost cut off from the rest of the world, the unique ideas of gifted musicians took shape and crystallised as individualistic styles. Each style, termed as gharana, boasts of one hugely gifted musician. His sons, relatives and other followers adopted his style to the extent of copying him; sometimes at the cost of their most precious gift – voice. We are aware of so many instances wherein Ustad Faiyaz Khan’s followers tried to emulate his robust voice-throw and in the process ruined their voices. There are some who copy the mannerisms of their idols more than their music. Conversely, there are a few like Rashid (Khan) who made their gurus proud by scaling the peaks of music in their own way. Moreover, the soil, air and water of a region play a vital role in texturing voice and tonality; so do the food habits and family traditions.

Is the concept of gharana relevant now?

A vehement ‘no’ came from both Kichlu, the founder director of ITC Sangeet Research Academy who revived the Guru Shishya Parampara and nurtured almost all Khayal gharanas during his twenty-two years tenure and strived to maintain their originality; and AC, one of the finest products of VK’s vision! According to both, a gharana actually represents an artiste’s individuality, devotedly followed by his progenies.

VK: I don’t believe in gharana system because each gharana has produced artistes who are diversely different from their brethren. Look at the legends like Krishnarao Shankar Pandit, Omkarnath Thakur, Kumar Gandharva and a host of others belonging to Gwalior Gharana. There is no similarity even in their voice-throw, what to say of their stylistic preferences.

AC: For initial foundation, one does need the support of a Gharana; just like the stamp of a renowned institution; but today children are spoilt for choice. The olden rigidity does not work now; neither the concept of closed-door sadhana or riyaaz. Under the circumstances one must be able to pick and choose the best suited ornaments available across Gharanas; but under the guidance of the guru. I try to preserve the uniqueness of all my disciples by allowing them to explore according to their preferences.

As the name suggests – Khayal gave freedom from the clutches of structured music of yore; yet Khayal gharanas were restrictive too and maybe that is why they are falling apart. Under the circumstances what will be the guiding factors?

AC: I plan to delve on that in details during the seminar. There are four major factors that define Khayal; and they are: voice-throw; embellishments; elaborations and compositions. Lyrics play a vital role in music making. With guided ‘vision’ of sur (tunefulness) and swara (notes), every talent can embark on his musical journey with confidence.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/71ga4y/article30521914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10DFRNCPABANDISH,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/whats-in-a-gharana/article30521917.ece
352,2020/01/09,HC directive to stop dischargeof sewage into backwaters,"Observing that emptying the sewage generated from the apartments and the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) commercial complex at Marine Drive into the backwaters is unfortunate, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the Kochi Corporation to explore the possibility of linking the sewage pipes of the apartments and the complex to the main sewage pipeline maintained by the GCDA.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chaly wondered how the Corporation had granted a building permit to the apartments which did not have any sewage treatment plants. The court said that it was the duty of the Corporation to take appropriate action against the builders.

The court made the observations when a petition seeking a directive to maintain the Marine Drive walkway came up for hearing.

Jaju Babu, counsel for the petitioner, submitted that the GCDA and Corporation had failed to comply with the earlier directions of the court including installation of lights and CCTV cameras. He also submitted that discharge of sewage into the backwaters should be stopped forthwith.

The Corporation had earlier informed the court that 65 pipes were seen connected to the backwaters from the apartments and commercial complexes.

Counsel for the Corporation submitted that steps were being taken to close down the pipes.

The court observed that if the pipes were closed down all on a sudden it would create difficulties for the public at large. The court directed the Corporation to ensure that the waste was removed from the apartments and the complex on a day-to-day basis.

The court also directed the Corporation to file a statement within two weeks in this regard.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hc-directive-to-stop-dischargeof-sewage-into-backwaters/article30526014.ece

The work is on in six wards in Thrikkakara. But the civic body and the contractor were locked in a tussle as the work moved to other wards before re-tarring the roads in the wards where the work on laying gas pipeline has been completed.

The Collector asked the Indian Oil-Adani group that is laying the gas pipeline to ensure that all the work, including road repair, in the first six wards is completed before the work moves to another wards.

The contractor also agreed to complete the road repair work by January 20. The contractor was directed to complete the next phase of the work in 15 days. The work would be monitored on a daily basis and a review meeting will be held weekly at the Collectorate. If there is any lapse in the work, a fine would be cut from the contractor’s security deposit.

355,2020/01/09,Murder of girl was premeditated: police,"The murder of the 17-year-old girl by a youth was a premeditated one, according to police.

Her body was found dumped in a tea plantation at Valparai on the border between Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The accused, Safarshah, 26, of Kumbalam, who was brought from Valparai to the city by a team of Central police in the early morning hours of Thursday, had allegedly planned to kill the girl enraged by her decision to reject him.

He was in possession of a knife when he had taken the girl along with him on Tuesday afternoon. According to the police, the murder was committed inside the car.

“He claimed to have thrown the knife away from inside the car a few kilometres away from where he dumped the body. We had searched for it briefly on Wednesday but couldn’t find it,” said S. Vijayasankar, Inspector, Central police.

Similarly, the police are yet to trace the bag of the victim, which also the accused claimed to have dumped somewhere along the route. However, they recovered his bloodstained shirt.

The police had taken the accused to the spot from where the body was recovered before he was brought to the city. They have registered a case against him invoking IPC Sections 302 (murder), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 366A (procuration of minor girl), and 370 (trafficking of persons).

He was produced before the court and remanded for 14 days. The police are expected to file a custody plea next week. “We will have to take him back along the route to the crime scene for evidence collection once we get his custody,” said Mr. Vijayasankar.

Service station petition

Meanwhile, the automobile service station where the accused was employed had lodged a petition against him at Maradu police. He had used a car from the service station to commit the crime. Maradu police have registered a case against him invoking IPC Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property).

The girl’s family had lodged a missing case with the police on Tuesday evening after the Plus Two student did not return from class. They had also shared their suspicions about the accused in her disappearance as he had in the past threatened to kill her.

Later the police learned that he had taken the girl in a car following which the vehicle details were passed on to various police stations, leading to the interception of the accused at Valparai. At that time the girl was missing from the car and the Valparai police also noticed blood stains inside the car. He later confessed to have murdered the girl.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/murder-of-girl-was-premeditated-police/article30524921.ece

357,2020/01/09,Maradu demolition: Meetings to instill confidence in residents,"With the preparations for demolishing the four flats reaching the final phase, the authorities are on a mission to instill confidence in general public, especially Maradu residents.

Four meetings will be held near the four apartment complexes from Wednesday explaining the safety and precautionary measures that have been put in place. The first meeting is likely to be held near Golden Kayaloram flat on Wednesday. Attempts are being made to complete the meetings on Wednesday itself. The meetings will be presided over by the respective ward councillors. Besides the civic representatives, officials of Maradu municipality would also attend, a senior civic official said.

Officials of the civic body are personally meeting residents near the apartments that are to be pulled down on Saturday and Sunday to explain safety measures. Meanwhile, the municipal council meeting, which was held on Tuesday, has decided to convey its disagreement regarding the minutes of a meeting convened by A.C. Moideen, Minister for Local Self-Government Department, last week in Thiruvananthapuram.

According to the minutes of the meeting, the civic body was to compensate the losses over and above the ₹95 crore insurance policy taken for demolition. However, the decision of the meeting was that the State government and the civic body would jointly compensate for the losses. Since the civic body alone could not shoulder the responsibility, the council had decided to send its enjoinder to the State government, said T.H.

359,2020/01/09,Insurance firms agree to pay market value of property at Maradu,"Insurance companies shall pay for the “reinstatement of the property” that may be lost or damaged due to the impact of the demolition of Maradu apartments on the “basis of Market Value prevailing without any depreciation,” according to the agreement inked by the Maradu Municipality.

The affected parties will have to send notices together with the estimate and proof of damage to the municipality and the insurance companies for settlement of claims, according to insurance documents.

The residents had long been demanding that compensation equivalent to the market value shall be paid for rebuilding the structures that may be damaged due to the demolition of the apartments.

The insurance policy will also cover injury to persons, including death, bodily injury, and illness, and damage such as physical damage caused to tangible property.

If a series of several bodily injuries or property damage takes place, which are attributed directly or indirectly to the same cause, all such injuries and damage will be treated as one claim. However, any claim arising from one specific case, made after three years after the first claim, will not be covered by the policy, the documents said.

The National Insurance Company had inked the agreement by involving the Maradu Municipality and the companies that were contracted for demolishing the apartments.

The insurance company shall not be liable to make payment for any claim made in a fraudulent manner or made with material misstatement or non-disclosure of material information. Any dispute regarding the quantum of compensation to be paid shall be referred to a technical committee comprising an advocate and surveyor appointed by the company and an advocate and valuer appointed by the insured, the documents said.

As regards injuries caused to persons, they shall be deemed to have occurred when the claimant first consulted a qualified medical practitioner in respect of the injuries. Damage shall be considered to have occurred when it becomes first evident to the claimant, according to the documents.

The policy shall not cover liability that may arise out of deliberate, wilful, or intentional non-compliance of any statutory provision. The loss of goodwill or market will also not be covered by the policy, according to the insurance company officials.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/y7x9ja/article30518161.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tvki-maradurevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/insurance-firms-agree-to-pay-market-value-of-property-at-maradu/article30518162.ece
360,2020/01/09,Demolition tourism springs shoots at Maradu,"H2O Holy Faith is not the name of a hallowed pilgrim ground. It is a 16-storey residential apartment complex that will be demolished on Saturday for violation of coastal regulation norms on an order from the Supreme Court.

The general strike day on Wednesday saw hundreds of people gather on the Kundannoor-Thevara bridge to have a glimpse of the apartment complex in what may be described as a clear case of demolition tourism springing shoots in God’s Own Country.

C.P. Sebastian, a mason and part-time autorickshaw driver, said he lived near Thripunithura and was in front of the apartment complex to see for himself as to what was happening and take a look at the building that was all over the television space.

He expressed no concern over the plans of the demolition team. However, he is a little worried about the fate of the bridge that stands near the apartment complex. It is too close for comfort, he said, observing the big crowd of people, most of them leaning on the railings.

Benny and Ranjan, friends from Chakkaraparambu who were united by their curiosity, expressed eagerness to be a witness to what was happening. They were asking around to calm their anxiety about what would happen if everything did not go as planned.

He added that the engineers involved in setting the stage for the demolition work had done a good job.

Mr. Sakhare was speaking to reporters after visiting Alfa Serene and H2O Holy Faith complexes with engineers and officials including Fort Kochi Revenue Divisional Officer Snehil Kumar Singh.

“The safety of people cannot be compromised, and we will leave no stone unturned,” he said, explaining the arrangements.

Hotel being evacuated

He pointed out that the authorities were also evacuating a five-star hotel within the 200-metre perimeter of the structures being demolished to ensure that no person was affected.

He added that there would be minimum traffic disruption on the demolition day, and that all instructions should be heeded to ensure the safety of people. There will be a rehearsal of protocols to be followed on Friday to ensure that everything is ready for the demolition day, the officer said.

Sufficient number of police personnel and officials will be deployed near the site to ensure that all aspects are taken care of, Mr. Sakhare added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/1pia72/article30518112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-KI-SAKHARE-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/all-arrangements-in-place-for-demolition-district-police-chief/article30518113.ece
362,2020/01/09,HC: respond to plea on market value assessment,"The Kerala High Court on Wednesday sought the response of the State Government and the District Collector on a plea by those living near the Maradu apartments seeking a directive to assess the present market value of houses and other structures within 200-metre radius of the flats.

In the petition, Harichandra Sai K.R. and others said they were anxious and concerned about their houses.

According to the petitioners, the authorities have no clear plan as regards the compensation to be given to residents in case their houses are damaged due to the implosion of the flats.

Unfair move

In fact, they were not responsible for the construction of the illegal flats. They have been living at the place for several decades.

Therefore, it is unfair to penalise the residents for negligence on the part of the builders.

Besides, they had invested their hard-earned money in the construction of houses, the petition said.

It added that the authorities were bound to protect the life and property of the petitioners. If their houses and other structures collapse due to the impact of the demolition, with the value of property not being assessed, they will be put to irreparable loss.

The assessment of the market value of houses will enable the authorities to fix adequate compensation if the buildings suffer damage, the petitioners pointed out.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hc-respond-to-plea-on-market-value-assessment/article30518097.ece
363,2020/01/09,General strike by trade unions total and peaceful in district,"The nationwide strike called by trade unions was total in the district, with public transport largely remaining off the road, shops, business establishments, and educational institutions being closed, and Government offices reporting abysmally low attendance.

The joint coordination committee of trade unions took out a protest march from Town Hall to Kaloor at 9 a.m. Besides, protest marches and meetings were held at 24 places across the district.

KSRTC restricted operations to Pampa services from South railway station with the sparse staff that turned up for duty. Over 70 services were operated for passengers reaching the railway station, while the depot in Ernakulam wore a deserted look, said Thajudheen Shahib, District Transport Officer, Ernakulam.

Private buses remained off the road.

Train services were more or less unaffected, with most trains operating on time. A few autorickshaws operated from the pre-paid stand at the railway station, said T.S. Gopakumar, Assistant Commissioner, Railway Protection Force, Ernakulam.

K. Laljy, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Ernakulam, said the city police had deployed vehicles for circular trips for rail passengers.

Not even a single boat service was operated as a majority of workers had joined the strike, said M. Sujith, traffic superintendent, State Water Transport Department, Ernakulam.

The Kochi metro operated services as usual between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. However, the ridership was very low with just over 37,000 people travelling till 9 p.m.

The otherwise buzzing Ernakulam market wore a deserted look. “With workers striking and cargo vehicles remaining off the road, there was no way the market could have operated,” said K.K. Ashraf, secretary, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.

Mohammed Sageer, president, Kerala Steel Traders Association, said notwithstanding the declaration by a section of traders to not cooperate with the strike, almost all shops and business establishments in the district remained closed as the strike was backed by all trade unions.

Of the 70-odd offices and around 2,500 employees, just a handful of offices operated albeit with an abysmally low attendance.

Operations at Infopark remained largely unaffected.

The strike was more or less peacefulexcept for a few minor skirmishes between protesters and shop owners over opening of shops. Two cases were registered in Kunnathunadu. In the first case registered by the police, a 70-year-old merchant, Poulose Kurian, was injured when hartal supporters forcibly shut his shop.

The mapathon is being conducted under the Cities4Forests project, a global initiative by the World Resources Institute (WRI) which has partnered with the Kochi Corporation. The project envisages expanding green patches in cities and mitigating the impact of climate change by protecting wetlands and biodiversity.

Kochi is the only city in the country to have been selected for the project last year. In the first phase of the project, councillors from the Corporation’s 74 divisions along with local experts will participate in the mapathon which will identify current land use in the divisions using satellite images. Buildings, green patches, open spaces, waterbodies and roads will be mapped by WRI in consultation with the councillors after which they can identify areas in their divisions where trees can be planted. The three-day exercise will result in a map that can suggest spaces in the city that are conducive to the growth of green patches.

366,2020/01/09,Kochi girl found dead at Valparai; stalker held,"The body of a 17-year-old girl, who had gone missing from the city on Tuesday, was found at a tea plantation at Valparai in Tamil Nadu, across the Sholayar forest range in Kerala.

The Central police have arrested Safarshah, 26, of Kumbalam in connection with the suspected murder. A Central police team led by Inspector S. Vijayasankar received custody of the accused from the Valparai police and recorded his arrest on Wednesday.

The accused had been stalking the girl for some time, and the murder was the culmination of his rage over the girl’s decision to reject him. “The girl’s family had lodged a missing case with the police on Tuesday. They had also shared their suspicions about the accused in her disappearance,” said K. Laljy, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Ernakulam.

Later, the police learnt that the accused, who works at an automobile service station, had taken the girl in a car. This eventually led to the interception of the accused at Valparai. At that time the girl was missing from the car and the police also noticed blood stains inside the vehicle. He later confessed to murdering the girl, the police said.

The body was recovered by a combined search party of the Malakkapara police and Valparai police a few kilometres away from where the accused was intercepted.

“The girl’s body had multiple stab wounds. We are carrying out some inquiries here and on completing will return to the city with the accused,” said Mr. Vijayasankar.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/city-girl-found-dead-at-valparai-stalker-held/article30517672.ece
367,2020/01/09,"Desire, social conditioning and brutality","A rare play on gay-bashing by a woman playwright of colour will add some sobriety to this month’s otherwise celebratory build-up to Mumbai Pride 2020 — or the Queer Azaadi March as it is often dubbed — scheduled for February 1. Rather than the sheer multitude of cis gay men who populate queer plays, Korean-American writer Diana Miae Son’s Stop Kiss centres around two women in love — traffic reporter Callie and schoolteacher Sara — whose innocent first kiss, in a public street, results in a brutal and unwarranted attack that leaves Sara in a coma, and Callie doing everything in her disposal to bring her back. The play seems particularly topical at the moment in India, since openly expressed vitriol and bigotry is something we are no stranger to, given the past week’s shocking turn of affairs at JNU. Queer populations in India have been especially vulnerable to unprovoked attacks, including those perpetrated by the powers-that-be, although most incidents of homophobia likely go unreported.

Son’s play opened off-Broadway in 1998 at the Public Theater in New York, the city in which it is set. The New York Times wrote “Manhattan growls like an underfed pit bull in [this] sweet, sad and enchantingly sincere play.” The opening run featured an upcoming Sandra Oh (as Sara), and was extended a record-breaking three times. Stop Kiss has since seen scores of productions, primarily in American community theatres and colleges, with several international stopovers in London and elsewhere. This week’s Indian production, directed by Dipika Pandey, will be staged by The Actors’ Truth, the academy run by veteran acting coach Saurabh Sachdeva, well-known to many as Sacred Games’ Suleiman Isa. Apart from the protagonists, an ensemble of actors will perform a constellation of characters in an adaptation that has been relocated, somewhat aptly, to suburban Mumbai with its beguiling mix of conservatism and hipness.

Cultural conflicts

The play is part of Sachdeva’s academy repertoire, having seen earlier iterations directed by alumni. Pandey’s version is a professional staging that is part of the academy’s ongoing Antarang Theatre Festival, whose theme is inclusivity in love. “This year we dedicate the festival to LGBTQ people who have stood strongly in the fight against prejudice in society,” says Sachdeva. As Son herself said, “I am consistently interested in the conflict between how other people identify you and the more complex way in which you know yourself. [There is a] contrast between how you assume things are one moment, and how they can utterly, irrevocably change in the next.”

Pandey’s own background in physical theatre — she’s trained in kalaripayattu and other forms — will likely bring a new dimension to the way her actors play out an otherwise wordy chamber drama. “I see the play as a form of protest. We structured it collaboratively out of what everyone’s interpretation was,” says Pandey, whose process involved an intense physical exploration, which allowed the actors to tap into emotions held within their own bodies. Her earlier movement collaboration with Arpit Singh, #metoo, relied similarly on somatic expression, juxtaposing the “toxicity we constantly absorb with our obsession with cleanliness.”

Pride month

Although it is not part of the official Mumbai Pride calendar brought out by a loose collective of community groups, Stop Kiss rounds out an interesting array of performing arts events slated for this month across the city. For instance, the Jimme Foundation will showcase the promenade presentation QMusical at Carter Road; StoryCellar will run workshops which will culminate in an evening of storytelling with freshly minted queer raconteurs, and the unapologetically redoubtable Rainbow Voices will hold sway with Bol Ki Lab Aazaad Hai Tere, a chorus concert with a difference. In another off-calendar theatre event, this writer’s venture with Queer Ink’s Shobhna S Kumar, InQueerAble, will see a dozen-odd theatre actors interpreting the word ‘queer’ in a 2020 context for an evening of solo performances next week.

Stop Kiss will stage on January 12 at Mukkti Cultural Auditorium at 8 p.m.; more details at bookmyshow.com",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/g8d7dk/article30525680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/The-Pasadena-Playhouses-Stop-Kiss-Photo-by-Jim-Cox,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/desire-social-conditioning-and-brutality/article30525681.ece
368,2020/01/09,When love is in the air,"The captivating tale of Nala, Damayanti and the Golden Swan (Hamsam), which was staged recently in the capital city, proved to be a treat for connoisseurs of Kathakali on account of the excellent performance of all the participants.

The opening scene depicted Sage Narada paying King Nala a visit. The sage, who knows of Nala’s interest in Damayanti, the princess of Vidarbha, intensifies the King’s feelings for her by delineating her virtues. He also encourages him to win her hand even though the gods are infatuated with her.

Kalamandalam Pradeep’s Nala took the cue from Narada, enacted by Margi Sukumaran. Nala is now thoroughly convinced that Damayanti is the most suitable bride for him, and as thoughts about her fill his mind, he entrusts various administrative responsibilities to his ministers and retires to the palace garden, seeking solitude.

The young actor’s presentation of Nala’s pangs of love and his interaction with Hamsam, who becomes his confidante, showcased his acting skills, which he imbibed from great teachers in Kalamandalam.

Sadanam Bhasi as Hamsam did his job as matchmaker, well, using a blend of realism and stylisation. He also succeeded in portraying the sincerity of Nala’s message for Damayanthi. His scintillating dance-interludes (‘kalaasams’) before quickly assuming the posture of the swan by balancing on one leg were admirable.

Margi Vijayakumar as Damayanti, accompanied by Kalamandalam Jishnuravi and Kalamandalam Aromal as her close companions, captured the attention of the audience from start till the end. Make-up and costume helped the artistes to be in sync with the characters.

Ppadams, ‘Puumakanum mozhimaatum…’ and ‘Minnal kkoti irangi…’, were well choreographed. The dramatic effect collectively built up by a series of imaginative and contextually appropriate innovations was outstanding.

Evocative interactions between Vijayakumar and Bhasi succeeded in depicting even the subtle feelings and emotions of the the heroine’s.

Bhasi’s performance did full justice to the playwright’s portrayal of Hamsam as a messenger extraordinaire capable of touching the depths of the human heart. Kottakkal Madhu’s musical rendition of Unnai Warrier’s play-text was superb. He was ably assisted by Vengeri Narayanan. The veteran singer embellished his rendition with an astonishing array of sangatis till the end of the play, which lasted for four-and-a-half-hours.

The percussion was handled by Kalamandalam Sreevin on the chenda and Margi Rathnakaran and Chunakkara Aji on the maddalam. The percussionists were in sync with the artistes on stage. Rathnakaran and Sreevin impressed the connoisseurs by dexterously simulating the love-lorn Nala’s futile attempt to get some solace by playing musical instruments like the veena and the mridamgam.

The performance was held under the aegis of Drisyavedi.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/rpy4pa/article30512902.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tvfNala1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/kathakali-enthusiasts-were-treated-to-a-recital-of-the-episode-where-the-hamsam-turns-matchmaker-for-nala-and-damayanti/article30512906.ece

370,2020/01/09,Bypass expansion: Inkel pulls out of pact,"Inkel Ltd (formally Infrastructure Kerala Limited), a public-private partnership company promoted by the State Government, has pulled out of the agreement it had reached with a Hyderabad-based construction firm for the Kozhikode bypass widening project.

Thus, the commissioning of the multi-crore project, which has been hanging fire for the past two years, will be further delayed. As per the original proposal, the construction of the six -lane bypass stretching from Vengalam to Idimuzhikkal should have started in August 2018 and completed in April 2020.

Sources said that Krishna Mohan Construction Private Limited (KMC), which secured the contract, had planned to rope in Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T), the Mumbai-based multinational conglomerate, to offer financial assistance to go ahead with the project. A letter in this regard would be submitted to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) shortly.

Following the new agreement, a new financial package would also be worked out for the project. The development comes at a time when the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the State government are struggling to execute the project with the construction company failing to provide bank guarantee.

Earlier, the NHAI had approved the proposal to set up a consortium with Inkel to take up the project. But later the company had second thoughts of involving a Kozhikode-based company due to the inordinate delay and cost escalation.

It was on April 18, 2018, that the NHAI and KMC inked an agreement for the ₹1,710-crore project. Despite reminders and warnings from the Public Works Department, the company failed to secure the bank guarantee of ₹85 crore for commencing the project. Later, the NHAI decided to accept the performance bank guarantee from the company.

Incidentally, the State government had handed over the land, which was acquired more than two decades ago, to the NHAI last month. About 130 hectares had been acquired for widening the bypass into 45-metre-width. Four major bridges, a minor bridge, eight flyovers, four vehicle underpasses, 17 pedestrian underpasses, 64 pipe culverts and 39 box culverts will be constructed as part of the project.

The expansion of the 28.4-km Kozhikode bypass is expected to solve traffic problems on the stretch to a great extent. The widening plan has been drawn up under the National Highway Development Project Phase III to be executed in the hybrid annuity mode. Thus the government will share 40% of the cost to start the work while the remaining investment will be made by the contractor.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/16gw5h/article30526840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Q0CTBYPASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/bypass-expansion-inkel-pulls-out-of-pact/article30526841.ece
371,2020/01/09,H1N1: Health workers to visit houses in Karassery,"Health activists and volunteers will visit every house in Karassery grama panchayat in Kozhikode district in the coming days in view of six students and one teacher from an aided higher secondary school at Anayamkunnu being diagnosed with H1N1 flu.

This was decided at a meeting attended by District Medical Officer V. Jayasree, grama panchayat representatives, and other Health Department officials on Thursday. Urgent meetings would be held in all wards. Anyone with fever symptoms has been directed to approach health activists.

All educational institutions in the panchayat, including anganwadis and madrasas, will remain closed on Friday. Karassery grama panchayat president V.K. Vinod urged the residents to avoid travelling and assembling in public places.

Health Department sources said that over 200 people were under observation now and there were no new cases. They suspect that the infection might have spread from a teacher who had visited a religious place outside Kerala and returned. She was one of the first to show the symptoms, it is learnt. A 24-hour call centre (0495 229 7260) had been opened at the community health centre (CHC), Mukkom.

Fever clinics

There will be fever clinics at the CHC, Karassery Primary Health Centre and the Anayamkunnu school.

Amar Fettle, State nodal officer for H1N1, said that people should cover their face with a hand kerchief or a piece of paper when they sneeze or cough as the airborne infection might spread up to one metre distance otherwise. Spitting in public places should be avoided. Washing hands after going out to public places was a must, he said.

‘No equal rights’

KSU president K.M. Abhijith and MSF State president Mishab Keezhariyur told the media on Thursday that the amendment had curtailed the equal rights of 292 UUCs.

It was also illegal and against the university statutes.

They claimed that the university hurrying up to conduct the election was akin to contempt of court as the Kerala High Court had asked the authorities to produce documents, including minutes of the Syndicate meeting, related to the amendment.

373,2020/01/09,Strike passes off peacefully in Malabar region,"Normal life was paralysed in Kozhikode district following the 24-hour nationwide strike on Wednesday called by various trade unions against the “anti-people” policies of the BJP-led Government at the Centre.

Striking organisations such as the INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC and other federations said that the strike was total. No untoward incident was also reported in the district.

Shops and commercial establishments remained shut despite the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samiti declared that traders would dissociate with the general strike. The busy commercial streets at Palayam and Big Bazaar in the city wore a deserted look throughout the day. Similarly, no shops opened on S.M. Street and Moideen Palli Road.

Except for private vehicles, mostly motorbikes, public transportation services was affected in the city as well as mofussil towns. State-owned KSRTC and private stage carriers kept off the road.

However, train services have not been disrupted. Many who arrived at the railway stations and without any means to travel had to hitch-hiked to reach their destinations.

Educational institutions were given a holiday and Calicut University has postponed all examinations scheduled for the day. Without public transport, candidates appearing for the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) being conducted by the National Testing Agency under the Ministry of Human Resource Development had a difficult time reaching the venues such as Kuttikkattoor on the outskirts of the city. Many had expected that the JEE (Main) scheduled on January 8 would be postponed.

Attendances at government offices and private establishments remained thin. Banking services have been severely hit though some private banks opened for their customers.

Towards evening, provisions stores and supermarkets opened to the relief of shoppers. Roadside fish vendors and petty shops also began functioning from 6 p.m.

In Wayand

Most of the shops and businesses remained closed in support of the strike called by the trade unions except the BJP-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh. This affected the normal life of people, especially migrants, who are dependent on hotels and other eateries for food.

The passengers who came by train were stranded at the railway station. May people were held up at the bus stand too as all the private bus operators, KSRTC buses, taxi and autorickshaws remained off road.

They were not up for any journey, since none of the buses were plying. But they found it an excellent opportunity to clean the buses that are often covered in heaps of dirt.

Thirteen intellectually challenged children, and a few others, under the aegis of the National Trust LLC, Kozhikode, Kozhikode Parivaar, Humanity Vocational Training Centre and SAFA global ventures cleaned five buses. They carried the cleaning equipment with them and cleaned the outside part of the buses and inside of one of them.

“We could not clean the inside of the other buses, as the children were affected by the dust that emanated from them. We had not carried masks and hence gave up cleaning the inside of the other buses”, said P.Sikander, convenor of the National Trust LLC in Kozhikode.

They started around 9 a.m. and completed the task by noon. “These children are being trained to be self-reliant. Activities like this will help them be socially committed as well”, Mr.Sikander said.

According to the prosecution, driver K. Kalidas, 27, of Vadakku Ilanthaikulam near Kayathar was harassing a girl from the same area and pestered her to marry him. As the girl told her relative and former village panchayat president Pandi alias Muthupandi, 55, of the same area about the problem she was facing, he warned Kalidas not to harass the girl any more.

Agitated over this, Kalidas assaulted Muthupandi even as he was going to open a valve on August 11, 2017 to ensure drinking water supply in public taps. When Muthupandi sustained injury and fell down, Kalidas attacked him with the stone repeatedly killing him on the spot.

A number of ‘abisehkams’ were performed amid chanting of Vedic hymns. The emerald Natarajar idol, which remained indoors covered with sandal paste for the past one year, was unveiled for public darshan. The sanctum sanctorum of the Natarajar sannathi would remain open till 3 a.m. on Friday, after which the idol will be covered with sandal paste only to be opened again next year.

The police brought the entire village under security blanket by deploying more than 500 police personnel to regulate the crowd. The district administration along with temple authorities made available sufficient drinking water and sanitation facilities.

Superintendent of Police V. Varunkumar said the event passed off peacefully. A minor argument ensued between mediapersons and the Joint Commissioner of the temple regarding taking photographs of the idol, which was settled peacefully later.

The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation operated 50 special buses from various parts of the district to the village and Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao oversaw the arrangements.

‘Sethupathi Rani’ R.B.K Rajeswari Nachiar and hereditary trustees of the temple were present.

V.K. Palanivel Pandian, diwan and executive secretary of the Samasthanam, said a fresh coat of sandal paste would be applied on the idol at 5 a.m. on Friday.

378,2020/01/09,BJP will reverse all historical blunders of Congress: Smriti Irani,"The Central government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, would reverse every historical blunder committed under the Congress rule so that the nation would be truly free and prosper, said Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani here on Thursday.

Addressing a public meeting organised by the BJP in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act, she wondered why the DMK had remained silent in November 2007 when the then UPA government asked the Special Commission for Rehabilitation not to entertain applications seeking Indian citizenship by Sri Lankan Tamils. “Was it because the Manmohan Singh government allowed the DMK to loot the nation?” she asked.

She questioned why the DMK allowed the UPA government to give citizenship to the Hindus of Pakistan in 2005-06 after allowing it to implement a rule that had been brought in by the previous BJP-government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee. “When you allowed Hindus then, why are you opposing them now?” she asked.

Alleging that the opposition parties were making a false propaganda that the CAA was meant to give citizenship only to the Hindus persecuted in Pakistan, she said in fact it had provisions to give citizenship also to Sikhs, Parsis, Jains, Christians and Buddhists from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Ms. Irani asked why the DMK was now opposed to giving citizenship even to Christians.

“Even the first Law Minister of Pakistan, Jogendranath Mondal, a Dalit, who was persecuted in Pakistan and forced to resign, came to India and died as a refugee in West Bengal,” she said. “Why was the DMK against Dalits too (by opposing the CAA),” she asked.

She alleged that the Congress was inciting university students to divide the country. The DMK was supporting the Congress that was opposed to revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir as they could not continue to loot the treasury in the State.

The Minister said that Mahatma Gandhi had said that India had the responsibility to provide a life with dignity to minorities like Hindus, Sikhs and Parsis of Pakistan if they were subjected to persecution. The Modi government had only fulfilled the wish of the Mahatma by bringing in the CAA.

According to her, the CAA was brought through a democratic process in Parliament.

381,2020/01/09,Pilgrims to progress in secure way,"The district administration is gearing up for the grand annual spectacle of Thaipoosam on February 8 this year.

The festival attracts thousands of devotees from across the state to Lord Muruga’s hill abode of Palani.

As part of preparatory work in the run up to the festival, about 100 workers were seen clearing the pathway meant for pilgrims on ‘padayatra’ on Thursday. The pathway that runs parallel to the road is paved with paver blocks and is about five feet wide and extends for about 50 km from Dindigul to Palani.

“Every year, devotees walk on the pathway to reach the temple during the Thaipoosam season. Many bushes and unwanted growth have come up along the pathway which are being cleared,” said Ayyasamy, commandant of 14th Battalion of TNSPF, Palani.

“We have started distributing reflector wrist bands and jackets to padayatris as they have started walking from various towns. We have put up six points on the district borders to meet their needs, so that we cover padayatris coming from Madurai, Theni, Karaikudi, Sivaganga, Tiruppur, Karur and Tiruchi. As part of security arrangements, we have increased night time patrol on the highway,” said R. Sakthivel, Superintendent of Police, Dindigul.

“We will increase two-wheeler patrols to 50. Light facilities are being improved. More barricades will come up on the stretch between Oddanchatram and Palani for better regulation of traffic and minimizing accidents,” he added.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) MP Su. Venkatesan was among those arrested when a section of protesters attempted to stage road picketing in front of BSNL Office at Tallakulam.

Mr. Venkatesan said the protest was against the Centre that was attempting to snatch all labour laws and righs of labour unions. The trade unions were demanding pension and other social protection schemes.

“The public sector units in the country were facing unprecedented attack under the Narendra Modi Government. Right from BSNL to Air India, major PSUs were being privatised,” he said.

‘Economy in poor shape’

Further, the economy of the country was also in worse shape under the BJP government.

“Even during the 2009 global economic meltdown and the 1999 economic recession in South East Asian countries, Indian economy remained insulated as major infrastructure facilities were under the control of public sector. Even the banking sector escaped the meltdown and recession due to strong financial regulatory mechanism under Reserve Bank of India. But, now all those strengths of the Indian economy were being attacked,” he added.

Hundreds of members of Southern Railway Mazdoor Union staged a demonstration in Madurai protesting against the Centre’s move to privatise railways.

The protest was led by its divisional secretary J.M. Rafi.

Police sources said bus services in the district were not affected. Trucks and autorickshaws were operated as usual.

Many shops selling mobile phones remained closed in protest against online business models.

Transactions in some of the public sector banks were affected as employees struck work.

“Just like the front pages of a newspaper are important in determining the quality of the paper, accuracy of lab results are seminal in the diagnosing process,” he said.

The flautist opened the concert with the Navaragamalika varnam “Valachi vacchi” placing the trust upon the lotus feet of Lord Venkatesa.

His next rendition was “Sreeman Narayana,” a kriti by sage Annamacharya, in Bowli set the theme of the concert to coincide with Vaikunda Ekadesi. In this song, Annamaiah describes the divine appearance and great qualities of the super soul Sriman Narayana and surrendering to Him.

Obeisance to Lord Ganesha, embodiment of the root chakra, was paid through ‘mulaa dhara murthy gaja” by Papanasam Sivan in ragam hamsadwani.

Saint Composer Tyagaraja’s “Sadhincene O manasa,” one of the pancharatna kritis, in aarabi was well appreciated by the audience. “Venkatramana Un Tiru,” by Papanasam Sivan in Latangi came in quick succession with little raga alapana.

His ragam, neraval and swaras were compact, leaving no room for monotony, for his next rendition “Muruga Muruga” in saveri ragam.

RTP was allotted sufficient time to enable the rasikas savour the ragas Aberi, Bilahari, Mohanakalyani and kalyana vasantham for a longer time, for the pallavi “Venugana lola Krishna”.

This was followed by a ‘Tani avartanam’ of a good standard by Tiruchi Harikumar on the mrudangam and Alathur Rajaganesh on the Khanjira.

The final pieces “jagad O dhaaranaa” in dhanakaapi or Kapi by saint Purandaradasa an “Radhaa Sametha Krishna” by G N Balasubramanian in Yamuna Kalyani, were very pleasing, as these songs and raga appear to be most suitable for playing on the flute.

Nearly 1,300 ANMs in Dakshina Kannada are involved in the household survey for ‘Nagarikarige Ondu Savalu’ programme. It identifies the best house and a government building each in a gram panchayat in terms of measures taken to prevent vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue and chikungunya.

Each ANM has to visit 100 houses in her area with a set of 13 questions relating to steps taken to prevent breeding of vector carrying mosquitoes. They are asked to note the mobile number of the house owner, his/her Aadhaar number, and signature.

The ANMs have to finish the survey this month and submit a report to the concerned Medical officer of the Primary Health Centre.

An officer overseeing the work said that for the last few days a section of people are objecting to giving information to ANMs fearing their link to NRC and NPR.

Messages have been circulated through Whatsapp asking people not to give any documents to Anganwadi workers, accredited social health activists and not receive any pamphlets or notices. People are asked not to sign any document, allow them to be photographed or give their mobile numbers.

The ANMs faced resistance in Sajipa, Ira and Bengre areas in Mangaluru taluk. On Thursday, an ANM reported of a threat of assault by a group from Paladka near Moodbidri if she did not return to them the book containing details she has collected. Similar resistance is faced by ANMs from Shirtady and Manchi villages of the Dakshina Kannada.

Chief Executive Officer of Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat R. Selvamani said a couple of incidents related to ANMs have come to his notice. “Collecting information about the household is among the duties assigned to Anganwadi workers, ASHA and ANMs. There is no need people to be apprehensive.

District in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojari, who announced the details of the utsav at a media briefing here on Wednesday, said that a colourful cultural procession would be taken out from Nehru Maidan to Karavali Utsav Grounds at Lalbagh.

While Mr. Poojari would flag off the procession as well as inaugurate the Karavali Exhibition, Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath would preside over the programmes.

Mr. Poojari said that cultural programmes would be organised at the exhibition ground, Kadri Park as well as Panambur Beach with added attraction of International Kite Festival from January 17 to 19 at Panambur Beach. He said that the organising committee has taken every care to accommodate local talent to perform at the cultural programmes. He added that out of the over 35 programmes, artistes picked for a majority of them are locals transparently.

The utsav would have Yuvajanotsava for local college students to exhibit their talent for two-days from January 16. Sports events, including football, volleyball, wrestling, basketball and throwball, would be held at various sporting arenas, he said. Sports events would also be held as part of Beach Festival, Mr. Poojari said and added that the highlight of Karavali Utsav would be conferring Karavali Gaurava Award at the valedictory function. Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh said that the administration has received ₹ 50 lakh grants from the State government to conduct the utsav. The organisers would raise additional funds through sponsorship, she said. State-wide publicity would be given for the event through LED display screens of the Department of Information and Public Relations in all the 30 districts.

Mangaluru City Corporation Commissioner S. Ajith Kumar Hegde said that Bank of Baroda staff would manage ticket sales for the exhibition where ₹ 30 and ₹ 20 entry fee is fixed for adults and children aged above 12, respectively. Children in the 5-12 age group would be charged half the fee. Discount would be given to students coming in groups. The organisers have opted for “German Tent” that is waterproof to cover the exhibition area, he said.

Dilraj Alva, owner of Sri Ganesh Prasad (SGP) buses running between State Bank and Mangaladevi in the city has got one of his buses pasted with stickers of Tulu vowels as well as hashtags — #Tuluto8thschedule and #TuluofficiallnKA_KL — in support of the demand.

“The bus is a medium that is available to me to kindle people’s thoughts,” Mr. Alva told The Hindu.

The script is scribbled on one of the Route No 27 buses with the name “Irawata”, that got a fresh coat of yellow and green paint for fitness certificate on Sunday. “I got the stickers pasted last night,” he said.

Mr. Alva further said, “It is not the first time that I am displaying messages for social causes. There are two other buses carrying messages on Swachh Bharat and Go Green,” he said.

Incidentally, Mr. Alva is one of the conveners of the Swatch Mangaluru Abhiyan that was taken up by Mangaluru Ramakrishna Mission for five years between 2015 and 2019. He was one among the few core volunteers along with Umanath Kotekar, Ganesh Karnik and Sachin Shetty supporting Swami Jithakamanandaji in the weekly cleanliness drives and awareness campaigns.

The Pura Pravesha of the seer was preceded by a pre-Paryaya tour, during which he visited various pilgrim centres across the country. The Pura Pravesha procession began from Jodu Katte at 3 p.m.

Before the procession began, the seer was garlanded by Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, Revenue Minister R. Ashok, and Housing Minister V. Somanna.

Giving up the convention of the would-be Paryaya seer sitting on a decorated carriage during the procession, the seer walked behind the golden palanquin carrying the presiding deity of Admar Mutt, Kaliyamardana Krishna. The seer and the palanquin were preceded by a long procession of about 70 folk and cultural teams.

It took an hour for all the teams to leave Jodu Katte.

The teams which participated in the procession included Huli Vesha, Dandiya, Chande, Kolata, Kode Kunita, Kangilu Nritya, Talimu, Pancha Vadya, Ganesha Nritya, Lavani, Garbha, Bhangra, traditional Costumes, Kamsale, Kathakkali, Bengali dance, Krishna Gopikiyaru, bhajan teams, among others. A large number of students from various educational institutions run by the Admar Mutt Education Council participated in the procession. They were holding placards with messages on environmental protection. At the end of the procession, a team of about 65 NSS students collected used bottles and other items from the route.

The members of Pejawar Shri Muslim Abhimanigala Balaga distributed beverages to people in the procession on the Court Road.

The procession passed through Taluk Office Road, Court Road, Diana Circle, Old Post Office Road, Tenkapete before culminating at Car Street.

Addressing presspersons here, Mr. Sorake said that the committee and the Zilla Muslim Okkoota wanted to hold the samavesha to further harmony in the society and not for any political reason as had been alleged.

The okkoota had also planned to have Sneha Samavesha with Bunts, Mogaveera, Christian, Dalit, and other communities.

The committee was non-political and had representatives of all political parties from the Billava community and not just the Congress as its opponents had alleged, he said. Both the committee and okkoota had held six meetings on this issue across Udupi district and none had opposed the samavesha in these meetings.

“The Paryaya festival is fast approaching. We don’t want any tension or unease to prevail. Our main intention is peace and harmony.

391,2020/01/09,Somanna: State government committed to providing houses for the poor,"V. Somanna, Housing Minister, said on Wednesday that the State government was committed to providing houses for all poor persons without houses and without sites.

He was speaking after laying the foundation stone for construction of 460 flats under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana by the Karnataka Slum Development Board and the Udupi municipality at Herga, here.

Mr. Somanna said that the State government was clearing the construction of houses which had been pending for the last five to six years. The previous State governments had only made announcements of construction but had hardly followed it with concrete action on their implementation.

The government had already given its nod for the construction of 39,000 houses for the poor across in the State.

The government had already permitted the construction of 500 houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana for Udupi district.

His department would also release the funds required for the construction of basic infrastructure facilities such as sewage treatment plant, roads and anganwadis for the flats to be built at Herga.

His department had decided that the construction of houses for the poor would be monitored by the Deputy Commissioner in urban areas, while the housing schemes for the poor in the rural areas would be monitored by CEO of zilla panchayats, he said.

His department was emphasising on transparency in this process. The beneficiaries who had got houses under the housing schemes for the poor should not sell their houses, Mr. Somanna said.

Basavaraj Bommai, Home Minister and Udupi in charge, said that both the Union and the State governments were giving priority to providing housing to the poor.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/xcnctr/article30517470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09MNUDUPIHOUSING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/somanna-state-government-committed-to-providing-houses-for-the-poor/article30517472.ece

Mr. Ashok said that even before governments started taking up that responsibility, the mutts and temples were doing ‘Anna Santharpane’ or mass feeding. They were also running running educational institutions now which helped a large number of students, he said.

“The seer had shown his foresight by announcing that his Paryaya would be a plastic-free one. The use of environment friendly materials for his Pura Pravesha ceremony showed his concern for environment,” he said. “This means that during his two-year Paryaya period we will see even more environment-friendly initiatives, which are needed given the increasing pollution in our cities,” Mr. Ashok said.

394,2020/01/09,‘Unit cost of houses under schemes likely to be raised’,"Housing Minister V. Somanna on Wednesday said the per-unit cost of houses being constructed under various housing schemes is likely to increase from the present ₹1.2 lakh to about ₹2.5 lakh. The Housing Department will also look at a realistic target of constructing 2 lakh houses per financial year from April 1, 2020, he said.

Speaking to presspersons here, Mr. Somanna said: “I have already urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to increase the limit to ₹2.5 lakh and am certain that he will do so. The limit could at least be enhanced to ₹2 lakh.”

This hike is a must given the steep hike in cost of construction materials, he said, adding this move would also give a fillip to Union government’s ambition to provide housing for all in rural and urban areas by 2022.

Regretting the rot that had set in the department since the time he was in-charge there, Mr. Somanna said: “The inquiry that I ordered since I took over has helped unearth large-scale irregularities in housing targets with cowsheds, pig-stys, goat sheds being counted as dwelling units,” adding the government has withdrawn grants to around 7 lakh such houses.

The Minister said while grants to 5.95-lakh houses were withdrawn at the government level, grants to additional 1.05 lakh houses were stopped after a high-level inquiry by the Chief Secretary.

At the same time, the government has released ₹211 crore to help genuine beneficiaries in 173 Assembly constituencies, whose projects were locked out from the system for different reasons, by restoring them and releasing funds through respective ZPs.

Mr. Somanna said the department would introduce an app to help nodal officers monitor progress real time and blamed his predecessors for stopping practices introduced by him.

The city police had not given them permission to hold the event at Nehru Maidan on January 4 on the grounds that central parts cannot be allowed to be choked and asked the organisations to scout alternative venues outside the city.

Former MLC and DK and Udupi Muslim Central Committee president K.S. Mohammed Masood told reporters here on Wednesday that the protest meeting will be held at Shah Garden, opposite the Kannur Kendra Jumma Masjid on NH 75. Qazis of Mangaluru and Udupi will participate in the event.

Mr. Masood said people, who have studied the CAA and its link with NRC, would speak at the meeting. “We are legally holding the event and have invited people from all communities, who are aware of CAA and NRC, to speak. Their names would shortly be announced.” he said. Around 1 lakh people are expected to attend the event and no women have been invited, he added.

Asked about messages in the social media asking people not to attend the event on January 15, Mr. Masood said, “I cannot say anything on that. We are holding the event in Adyar.”

398,2020/01/09,NCLT to consider only govt. probe on CG Power,"The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which is hearing a matter related to restatement of accounts of CG Power, has said that only a probe by a government body would be considered by the tribunal while deciding on the matter that stems from alleged funds siphoning by the company’s former chairman Gautam Thapar.

This assumes significance since the allegations against Mr. Thapar and a few senior officials of the company — who were barred from accessing the securities market by the Securities and Exchange Board of India in September 2019 — are based on the report prepared by law firm Vaish Associates that was mandated by the company and hence does not qualify as “independent”.

Only a probe by the government or any government body can be considered, the Mumbai NCLT bench said on Thursday, while posting the matter for January 23.

Incidentally, SEBI passed an interim order against Mr. Thapar in September 2019 based on the Vaish report while barring the former chairman, along with a few other senior officials of the company, from accessing the securities market.

The capital markets regulator, however, has also ordered a forensic audit — which will qualify as independent — to verify allegations of manipulation and misrepresentation in the books of accounts of the company.

Interestingly, the appeal at the NCLT for restatement of accounts has been filed by the government even though the dispute is between a listed entity and its former chairman and senior officials.

“Tendency of government departments getting into a private dispute between two parties needs to be relooked at,” said Sumit Agrawal, Founder, Regstreet Law Advisors.

“Government departments should rather assess before getting into a matter so that they are not used by private parties to settle personal scores or vested interests,” added Mr. Agrawal, who earlier worked with the legal department of SEBI.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/nclt-to-consider-only-govt-probe-on-cg-power/article30526679.ece
399,2020/01/09,Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to visit India next week,"Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos will be visiting India next week and is likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and officials, besides industry leaders, according to sources.

The top executive will also attend SMBhav — an event focussing on small and medium businesses in India - that is slated for January 15-16 in the capital city.

When contacted, Amazon declined to comment.

Amazon, which has seen significant growth in its business in India, has also witnessed protest from a section of traders in the country who claim that e-commerce giants including Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart offer deep discounts and engage in unfair business practices.

Last year, the government had tightened rules for e-commerce marketplaces with foreign investment. These rules barred such platforms from offering products of sellers in which they hold a stake and banned exclusive marketing arrangements among other clauses. Following this, Amazon restructured its joint ventures to ensure compliance.

Bezos is likely to discuss regulatory issues in his meeting with the government officials.

402,2020/01/09,The Indian Constitution’s unitary tilt,"The recent political developments around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) have revealed some of the most significant crevices of Indian federalism. Soon after the protests erupted, several State governments occupied by Opposition parties or partners of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) declared that they would not implement the law. Further, in a somewhat unprecedented move, the Legislative Assembly of Kerala went to the extent of passing a resolution, stating that the law “contradicts the basic values and principles of the Constitution”. Indeed, the resolution is only symbolic, and has no legal ramifications. And, though the passage of any such resolution is not constitutionally barred, it may not be in tune with the federal scheme under the Constitution.

Similarly, Article 256 of the Constitution obligates the State government to ensure implementation of the laws made by Parliament. If the State government fails to do so, the Government of India is empowered to give “such directions to a State as may appear... to be necessary”. The refusal to enforce the law even after the Centre issues directions would empower the President to impose President’s Rule in those States under Articles 356 and 365. The Supreme Court of India has also confirmed this reading of the law in S.R. Bommai v. Union of India — arguably the most significant case on Indian federalism.

Anti-CAA ads in West Bengal

Another controversy arose in West Bengal, where the State government put anti-CAA advertisements on its websites. In an interim order, the Calcutta High Court directed the State government to remove those advertisements. The question — whether State governments are empowered to use public funds to campaign against a law made by Parliament — is open for final determination. In its final judgment, the High Court could bar the State government from campaigning against a parliamentary law.

Therefore, neither the refusal to implement nor the official protests registered by State governments carry much legal force. However, we will be missing the forest for the trees if we fail to see the premise that has led to such proactiveness on the part of some State governments — the emergence of a dominant party at the Centre. Political analysts have offered various nuanced takes on what the rise of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s dominance means for electoral politics. The impact of a single-party dominance on the functioning of our constitutional structure, however, receives little attention. For instance, Parliament, the avowed “temple of democracy”, has been reduced to a site for procedural formalities. At least the Lok Sabha appears to be an extension of the executive, rather than a mechanism for its accountability.

Power of brute Central majority

This truncation of the role of Parliament in the face of single-party dominance is further facilitated by the poor understanding of the role of a parliamentary Opposition in Indian politics. Once the competition for people’s vote is over, it goes, the losers should step aside, respect the democratic mandate, and let the government do its job. The Opposition may question the government like ordinary citizens, or prepare for the next election, but should not meddle in governance. Any further interference by the Opposition, particularly in such polarised times, would risk inviting the labels of anti-national “seditious cabals”. The brute dominance of the ruling persuasion has dwarfed any semblance of Opposition politics at the Centre. This is manifested through the absence of the Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha for six years in a row (a consequence of an archaic and arguably unlawful practice requiring a party to secure at least 10% of total seats to occupy the position of Leader of Opposition), the denial of an Opposition vote in the appointments to various anti-corruption bodies, etc. Further, with the Opposition failing to show any signs of resilience, national politics seems to be operating in the absence of any credible political check.

Arguably, such capture is not unprecedented. Time and again, our experiences with single-party dominance have shown that in the face of comfortable majorities, our constitutional structure reveals its tendencies to concentrate power. The concentration of power, dormant in the times of coalition governments, is not merely a bug introduced by the BJP, but is embedded into the very structure of the Constitution. A ‘Centrist bias’ of the Indian Constitution further augments the powers of the brute national majority. In the backdrop of a bloody partition and threats of “fissiparous tendencies”, it was probably justified for the founders of the Indian republic to be hesitant in instituting a stronger federalism. If we wanted to be together, the argument went, we could only have so much federalism.

Electoral federalism

But over seven decades, there have been changes in ground realities. Over the last couple of years alone, we have seen repeated examples of huge vote swings between national and State elections, separated by only a few months, in the same constituencies. And that too against a dominant national party with unprecedented organisational capabilities. These have offered convincing evidence that Indian voters are not only nuanced in their voting choices, but can also reconcile their seemingly contradictory votes in national and State elections. In other words, federalism is not a mere legal division of powers; the democracy and voters, too, are becoming federal. This popular embrace of electoral federalism may be one of the most significant achievements of Indian democracy.

Hence, thanks to electoral federalism, the “losers” of national politics can still win State elections and form legitimately elected governments. The State governments are thus filling the Opposition deficit at the Centre. With this shift of Opposition politics from New Delhi to State capitals, the politics of Opposition is likely to become the politics over federalism. Is the whole greater than the sum of its parts, as the Central government would want us to believe? Or are the parts going to determine the future of the whole, as State governments are likely to argue?

The conflict that the CAA has triggered might become a template for future contestations over the federal question. While the politics seems to be ripe for advancing federalism, the law is likely to constrain such a development. We should not be surprised if the Constitution, a product of its time, falls behind the demands of democratic politics. The protesters are fighting for upholding the founding commitments of the Constitution. Ironically, the very Constitution that could ensure the fulfillment of the protesters’ demands is empowered to hamper federal politics. Perhaps there also lies a cautionary note against constitutional idolatry.

403,2020/01/09,The age of agitations,"Last year saw mass agitations across continents, causing 2019 to be referred to as “the year of the street protester”. There were protests on issues ranging from political freedom, to economic inequality and corruption, in Hong Kong, Chile, Catalonia, West Asia and other parts of the world. Most of these agitations continue this year in some form.

The triggers for the protests varied. In Hong Kong, they grew out of opposition to an Extradition Bill that would have allowed the city’s residents to be prosecuted in mainland China. After getting the Bill withdrawn, the protesters began seeking an inquiry into police violence and broader democratic reforms. In Chile, the protests that were initially against a hike in Santiago’s metro fares grew into a wider campaign against inequality. The protests in Barcelona were triggered by the conviction of Catalan activists for sedition. Lebanon, Egypt and Iraq also saw mass protests on issues related to corruption and overall mistrust in government.

While the causes driving these protests are different, there are some commonalities in their character, composition and methods. The agitations are mostly leaderless, just like those in India against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens; they are not driven by Opposition parties; and they operate through decentralised networks. Also, they have been mostly non-violent and used novel agitational techniques. They are also characterised by the important role played by the youth, especially students.

The state responds with force

The state’s response to these protests has ranged from acceptance of certain demands to brutal violence. Ironically, while India is the only long-standing constitutional democracy among these countries, it has arguably been the most brutal in repressing this entirely democratic form of expression. The Indian state has used various strategies: shutting down the Internet; imposing Section 144 across cities; denying permission; detaining protesters; and ruthlessly using police power. Action by the Delhi police against students in Jamia Millia Islamia and inaction by the same personnel when it came to protecting students at the Jawaharlal Nehru University; and the disproportionate use of force in Uttar Pradesh particularly raise alarming questions.

The ongoing agitations bring to memory the protests of 2011, a year that saw the Arab Spring, the Occupy Movement and India’s anti-corruption agitation. However, a more apt parallel would be the movements of 1968. What characterised those, especially in Paris, was the solidarity between the students and the working class. The French philosopher Henri Lefebvre’s The Right to the City (Le Droit à la ville) had just come out and it provided a clarion call to challenge the structures of capitalism and articulate an alternative “contract of citizenship” whereby all inhabitants (not just formal “citizens”) collectively re-appropriate urban space.

The current protests have mostly not yet taken such a radical form. However, there have been strategic alliances, with Catalonia adopting the “#BeWater” methods used in Hong Kong. Inspired by Bruce Lee’s quote “Be water, my friend”, protesters there employed a fluid agitational tactic. If the Indian state becomes more repressive, the agitators in India may consider this approach.

Further, while the protests in Hong Kong and Chile have resulted in their governments rolling back their proposed measures, it is unclear what the Indian government will decide. However, irrespective of their future, the CAA-NRC protests have enabled the youth to articulate a new form of resistance, build cross-group solidarities and puncture the myth of an invincible monolithic regime.

404,2020/01/09,It is high time the National Defence University takes off,"Back in 2018, strategic analyst B.A. Friedman highlighted the track changes needed for the U.S. military. Among those are two interrelated pointers for the Indian military that merit serious attention. The first is that Generals, Admirals and Air Marshals must move away from their comfort zone of “being in charge” on the battlefield, and smoothly make the transition to being “combat enablers and policy advisers”. While there is certainly a need for classical generalship while orchestrating large forces in conventional battle scenarios, the more immediate challenges rest in the sub-conventional and limited war domains. It is these domains that demand high levels of proficiency and autonomous leadership qualities at the unit, battalion, squadron and brigade levels, with the senior leadership playing primarily a facilitating role. If this is an outcome that India’s military needs to strive for, the path must be shaped by a new kind of education.

Mr. Friedman suggested that “the military’s existing educational institutions should remove training from their curriculum”. This, he argued will “free up time for academic study in subjects such as international relations, strategic theory, geopolitics and conflict analysis and resolution”. Senior leaders, he suggested, need to retrain themselves to move away from rigid chains of command, and learn to “respectfully disagree, balance multiple viewpoints and opinions, and present complex arguments” to diverse audiences.

Demands on senior leadership

Here, I want to revisit some points on Professional Military Education (PME) that I had expressed through two articles written for The Hindu in 2012. I had argued: “If we are prepared to accept that we are entering a period of momentous change in which the war of networks and ideas is overtaking the established state, we need to take a close look at what propels this warfare... If chaos is the signature of modern warfare, it must be countered with more unpredictability and chaos, something that is alien to structured militaries the world over. Traditional military skills, systematic problem solving and structured thinking have to be supplemented with creatively modified academic and intellectual skills at every level.” Some of these reflections should strike a chord in India among those within the national security establishment who feel that educational reform is long overdue in the Indian military.

The process must begin at the top. One of the major responsibilities of the armed forces’ leadership is to crystal gaze into the future and suggest military capabilities and structures that would keep pace with the rapid changes in warfare, geopolitics and technology, and arm the man behind the machine with the necessary skills and intellectual armour required to stay ahead of competitors and adversaries. This is an imperative if India wants to move up the strategic value chain, from being a regional power to a leading power. Of the several attributes that a military leader in India must possess, it is not so much the operational or technological domain that demands special attention, but the intellectual dimension.

The legendary strategic affairs thinker K. Subrahmanyam, during a conversation with me in 2006, had said: “[W]e need to put our house in order. While creation of world-class infrastructure is important, unless we have the right faculty, and idea/content developers, the NDU [National Defence University] stands no chance of matching up to similar institutions on the global arena. I only hope that the same turf wars that plague inter-service synergy do not hamper the putting together of the core group that is entrusted with building the institution.” His views need to be revisited now and a renewed momentum given to the NDU.

The pace at which the building blocks of the NDU have been erected is much like India’s growth rate in the 1970s. Though conceived earlier, it gained momentum in the aftermath of the Kargil conflict and was given form over a decade later when it was inaugurated in 2013 with a stone-laying ceremony in Binola, near Delhi. There are some who believe that the envisaged four-pronged structure of the NDU with security studies, technology, leadership and management and distance learning is far too ambitious. Others argue that it is important to think big if India is to emerge as a leading power. The bottom line is that the desired outcomes and the quality of human resources must dictate the trajectory of how the NDU comes up. It must be the prime mover of intellectual capital in a reformed Indian military.

405,2020/01/09,Betrayals from outside and within,"The fight against the Islamic State (IS) was won with the help of three major forces on the ground, for the Western coalition on its own would not have managed to do much with remote-controlled bombs. These were the Kurds, the Shia militia and ordinary Muslims (Sunni and Shia) who spoke up against the kind of Islam espoused by the IS and its supporters, choking the movement of easy recruits. Towards the end of 2019, Donald Trump’s America betrayed the Kurds and abandoned them. In early 2020, with the ‘targeted killing’ of Qassem Soleimani, Trump’s America betrayed the second partner: the very Shia forces with which the West had collaborated in both Afghanistan and Iraq to fight al-Qaeda and the IS. So, what is it that the third force, ordinary Muslims — whether religious, like so many, or irreligious, like me — should expect in the future?

The ‘Muslim’ tag

Let’s face it: Muslims like me in India can no longer avoid that designation. I grew up believing with my secular Hindu friends that I was an Indian first and last. ‘Muslim’ was not a tag I wanted. Recent legislative acts, supported by some of my ‘secular’ Hindu friends, have revealed to me that either they had been lying to me, or they had been lying to themselves. Obviously, ‘Muslim’ is the tag that many in India want to attach to people like me. I seem to have no choice in the matter, despite the fact that I remain what I was: Indian, secular, irreligious.

Is the matter different in the wider world? I am not sure. Let us take the murder of Gen. Soleimani. Unlike Osama bin Laden and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Gen. Soleimani was a high-ranking official of a sovereign nation. He was by no means a lovely human being, but then Mr. Trump himself is not a lovely human being. Very few high officials of autocratic nations are lovely human beings. That is not the issue, as it appears to be in many western articles, which focus on Gen. Soleimani’s reported villainy. The issue is this: a country decided to openly murder a high official of another country with which it was not formally at war. This runs contrary to all international laws. It also sets a precedent by which any country can now decide to murder, if it can, the official of any other country. Why isn’t this issue being taken up in the otherwise so law-abiding free ‘West’?

Instead, what is being discussed is the ‘near war’ between Iran and the U.S.: as if Iran, at least 100 times weaker in military power than the U.S., can dare to wage a war. Iran, it is obvious to anyone who pays attention, is fighting with its back to the wall. Its economy is crippled. It is surrounded by U.S. forces.

After all, Gen. Soleimani was visiting Iraq, not Mexico or Canada. Western commentators talk of asymmetrical warfare being waged by Iran, when it appears to me that the main ‘asymmetrical’ warfare being waged today is by the U.S. — with its economic sanctions against every real or perceived threat, from China to Iran.

Why are supposedly independent ‘western’ commentators — I am talking of The Guardian, not even Fox News — unable to analyse these aspects? If I point it out, why am I suddenly a Muslim, and not a human being who wants a somewhat fair, democratic and secular world order? If someone like me feels that he is being pushed, both nationally and internationally, into being first and foremost a ‘Muslim,’ then what is it that practising Muslims must be feeling? I shudder to think of it.

And I shudder to think of what mischief Islamists, Shia or Sunni, will hatch from this feeling among ordinary Muslims. It will be so easy for the younger generations to fall into the Islamist trap. It will be so easy for them to resist people like me, who have been saying endlessly and continue to do so: be a human being first, be an Indian or American or French citizen first, keep your religion to yourself. This has been contrary to what Islamists mostly preach: for them, being Muslim is the distinctive identity, and almost the only one.

Let me end this essay of despair with a word of advice, and aimed only at Muslims, religious or not. For why shouldn’t I address only Muslims, when so many are willing to address me only as Muslim? This is what I say: resist the Islamists. Yes. I say it still: resist the fundamentalists. For they are at the root of your problems. It is because Islamists insist so narrowly on their own versions of Islam and because fundamentalists have been so intolerant of diverging Muslims within their own lands that Muslims across the world fail to support each other and anyone else who needs support. The killing of Gen. Soleimani — mourned by many, celebrated by some in Iraq — was an illustration of this. As is the fact that the oil-rich, culturally similar states of West Asia need to be policed into ‘peace’ by the U.S. and other western powers.

Narrow identity

At the core of the crisis in the so-called Muslim world is not the U.S. or any other external factor. It is the narrowness of Muslims themselves. It is the narrowness of their understanding of themselves. By failing to allow other Muslims to believe or not to believe in their own ways, they do not just divide themselves up — persecuting the atheists, Ahmedis, Bohras, Shias, Sunnis etc. — they also cut themselves off from other communities. If you cannot allow fellow Muslims to differ openly, how will you accept Hindus or Sikhs who do not believe like you do? This is at the heart of the problem. Religious Muslims need to expand their understanding of Islam in order to embrace — and be embraced by — the world.

406,2020/01/09,From the brink of war: on U.S.-Iran conflict,"The latest spell of conflict between the U.S. and Iran turned full circle on Wednesday when Tehran launched ballistic missile attacks at American troops in two military bases in Iraq in retaliation for the assassination of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. In its first direct attack on U.S. forces, Iran targeted Erbil, the capital of the Iraqi Kurdistan in the north, and Al-Asad in the west, which is some 400 km away from the Iranian border. The attacks were both an act of retaliation and a show of its capability. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif invoked Article 51 of the UN Charter, which allows member-states to take military actions in self defence if they come under attack. He said Iran has taken and concluded “proportionate measures in self-defence”, which can be interpreted that Iran is now ready for de-escalation. The man who is primarily responsible for the current explosive situation is U.S. President Donald Trump. His decision to kill Soleimani, a top Iranian military leader who commanded the elite Qods Force for over two decades, in the Iraqi capital, was practically an act of war, forcing the Islamic regime to respond. However, despite the wide range of rhetoric issued by Iranian military leaders and hard-line politicians, what Tehran actually did was to launch a calculated, limited strike. It is as much an act of revenge as an opportunity for de-escalation.

The Pentagon’s assessments suggested there were no American casualties and only minimal damage in the attacks. Mr. Trump, in his response later on Wednesday, has signalled that he was backing away from further conflicts with Iran. If the U.S. had responded with air strikes or missile attacks inside Iran, it could have triggered further attacks from Iran, setting off a cycle of violence and aggression. A direct shooting match between the U.S. and Iran would have been disastrous for the whole of West Asia. Iran may be a weaker power compared to America’s conventional military might, but it is a formidable rival. It not only has ballistic missiles and a wide range of rockets but also a host of militias under its command across the region. It could have made an invasion and air strikes on its territories extremely costly for the U.S. and its allies. It could also have disrupted global oil supply by attacking the Gulf waterways. By any assessment, a direct war would have been catastrophic. Mr. Trump did well to step back and not push the Gulf region into a disastrous cycle of violence and destruction. The international community should now push for a diplomatic settlement of the crisis and find ways to revive the nuclear deal which could bring long-term peace to the Gulf. And Iran should seize this opportunity for de-escalation.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/from-the-brink-of-war/article30517035.ece
407,2020/01/09,Reality check: on govt projecting slower GDP growth,"The government’s advance estimates for economic output and growth for the fiscal year ending in March may raise eyebrows, but only for the wrong reasons. The National Statistical Office (NSO) has estimated that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will expand by 5% in the 12-month period, in line with the Reserve Bank of India’s sharp downward revision last month in its full-year growth forecast — from 6.1% projected earlier, to 5%. The NSO’s estimate is a full 2 percentage points lower than the 7% figure that the Economic Survey had projected on the eve of the newly elected government’s annual Budget in July, reflecting the continued sharp slide in momentum. However, disconcertingly, even the latest growth assumption appears grounded more on optimism than on real hard data. Given that the pace of growth slumped to a six-and-a-half year low of 4.5% in the second quarter, thus dragging the first half’s expansion to 4.8%, the statistics office’s projection for the full year assumes that the economy will expand by a healthier 5.2% pace in the October-March six-month period. It is this premise that is hard to square with all the macro-economic data available so far, as well as the assumed estimates for the key expenditure components that together total up to the overall GDP. Take for instance the very cornerstone of demand in the economy, private consumption expenditure, the NSO’s projection assumes that consumers would go out and spend an additional ₹4.77 lakh crore, or almost 12% more, in the second half, than what they had spent in the preceding six months. Not only do most high-frequency indicators, including automobile sales, belie this assumption, even the RBI’s consumer confidence survey points to a decline in non-essential consumption compared to a year ago.

The NSO’s estimates also paint a picture of a distinct uptick in the final six months of the current fiscal in a key sector. Manufacturing, which contracted 0.2% in gross value added terms in the first half, is now posited to turn around and post a 2% expansion for the full 12 months. This projected revival in the crucial job generating sector again appears premised more on wishful thinking given that industrial output data from October showed the sector having shrunk by 2.1% from a year earlier. With private investment activity still becalmed — full-year growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation is estimated at just about 1% compared with 10% in the last fiscal — and a significant shortfall in revenue receipts leaving the government little room to bump up its own spending within the constraints of the budgeted fiscal deficit target, it may be time for radical solutions. And with the clouds of conflict darkening over the crucial energy supplying West Asian region, India’s economy will be even more vulnerable now to another oil price shock. Clearly, it is time to expedite tangible policy interventions.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reality-check/article30517062.ece
408,2020/01/09,DGCA suspends pilot’s licence for grass landing,"Aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, on Thursday announced suspension of a GoAir expatriate commander for 6 months and the co-pilot’s licence for 3 months after being found to be involved in a case of serious runway excursion at Bengaluru on November 11.

In a report released on Thursday, the DGCA said GoAir flight G8-811 from Nagpur to Bengaluru with 180 passengers on board was involved in a serious incident when the crew lost visual reference at about 50 feet above ground (while landing), but continued to land which was in violation of requirements laid down in civil aviation requirements, meant to be followed by airline for the safety of aircraft operations.

“The crew considered wrong visual reference as runway centreline and manoeuvred the aircraft to the left of Runway 09. The first officer (co-pilot), who did not monitor flight-path deviation in the cockpit instruments, failed to give call-out for deviation,” a senior DGCA official said.

The aviation regulator suspended the Foreign Aircrew Temporary Authorisation of the expatriate pilot for a period of six months, while the flying licence of the co-pilot, an Indian national, was suspended for three months, starting November 11. The DGCA said it had show-caused both the pilots to submit an explanation on the lapses, and both accepted their mistake in writing.

On November 11, the aircraft, an Airbus A320 Neo aircraft had gone off the runway onto the unpaved area travelling 200 meters over grass. The GoAir flight from Nagpur was then diverted to Hyderabad and officials noticed mud and grass deposits on the main landing gear when it landed there. An inspection by officials of the regional DGCA office, Bengaluru, and Kempegowda International Airport, reported landing gear marks on the unpaved surface.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dgca-suspends-pilots-licence-for-grass-landing/article30527271.ece
409,2020/01/09,SIT arrests key member of Gauri murder plot,"The Special Investigation Team (SIT), on Thursday, arrested a key member of the unnamed organisation behind the murder of activist and journalist Gauri Lankesh. The accused, Rushikesh Deodikar, had managed to evade investigators until recently.

The SIT, which is also probing the assassination of M.M. Kalburgi, caught the trail of Deodikar in December 2019. The arrest was made on Thursday, from Katrasgarh, a small town near Dhanbad, Jharkhand, where Rushikesh was hiding and working at a bookstore.

Deodikar, 44, hailing from Aurangabad district of Maharashtra, went by the names Murali and Shiva. He was a key member of the unnamed criminal syndicate behind the murders of Dr. Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare, M.M. Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh between 2013 and 2017.

The chargesheet in the Gauri Lankesh murder case, has several references to his role. Multiple key accused in the case – Sharad Kalaskar, Vasudev Suryavamshi, recruiters for the gang in Karnataka Sujith Kumar and Manohar Edave – have said Deodikar was an ideological motivator and recruiter.

“In the hierarchy of the syndicate, he was only next to Dr. Virendra Tawde and Amol Kale, who led conspiracies and execution of the four murders. Catching Deodikar was key, as he had the potential to recoup the gang after the spate of arrests and continue with their target of eliminating durjans,” said a senior SIT official. “He was part of the conspiracy in all the four murders,” the official said.

Rushikesh Deodikar will be produced at a local court in Katrasgarh, Jharkhand on Friday and will be brought to Bengaluru by Saturday on a transit warrant. He will be produced before a city court on Saturday when SIT will seek his custody, sources said.

Of the 20 people named in the charge-sheet, 19 have been arrested.

410,2020/01/09,Smart cameras for facial recognition to be installed at KSR City Railway Station,"In an effort to enhance security at the Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna City Railway Station (KSR Bengaluru) and to identify and prevent criminals, especially human traffickers, from entering the station, the South Western Railway is all set to use facial-recognition software linked to advanced artificial intelligence.

According to the railways, procurement of face recognition CCTVs is in the final stage and the pilot project will commence soon. SWR’s Chief Public Relations Officer E. Vijaya said, “This is the first of its kind in the country and once implemented, based on the scheme of things, it will be expanded to other stations across the country.”

Earlier, in September 2019, a proof of the concept was tested in the presence of senior railway officers by SWR security team. The test demonstrated, with suitable technology and without interrupting huge crowd flow at the railway station, 100% of face recognition and 100% matching with accuracy.

“The aim of the pilot project was to design a suitable technology for IR scenario which will create a digital perimeter over Indian Railways and identify any criminal entering the railway stations, with the help of advanced artificial intelligence, without disrupting the traffic flow in and out of stations,” the release said.

A database of human traffickers can be created through this initiative.

411,2020/01/09,"Conmen pose as builders, dupe customers, banks of ₹20 crore","The Central Crime Branch have arrested two men who allegedly posed as builders, took personal and bank details from gullible potential buyers and used that information to avail of bank loans up to ₹20 crore in their names. They carried out the scam a year-and-a-half ago, but the incident came to light in December 2019.

“The accused duped many nationalised and private banks by submitting KYC documents of the buyers and fake documents of the property they claimed to have been developing,” said Ravi Kumar, DCP (Crime). The potential buyers were not aware that loans had been taken in their names.

“The banks that were duped cleared these loans without verifying the property or following due procedure. We have issued notices to them to appear before us for questioning as we suspect that some employees may have been part of the scam,” DCP Kumar added.

The CCB is also submitting a detailed report on the scam to the government with a recommendation that the case be handed over to the CBI or CID for a detailed probe.

The conmen, identified as Manjunath, 34, from Basaveshwara Nagar and his associate Ranganath, 37, perpetuated this scam a year and a half ago. The police are also probing why the matter came to light as late as last month if banks had not recovered the loan amount.

The scam came to light in the last week of December when a businessman, Ravi Kumar S., was approached by officials of nationalised bank, informing him that a home loan had been taken in his name. He was asked to pay the dues.

As he had not taken any loan from the bank he approached the High Grounds police immediately. Based on this one complaint, the CCB launched a probe and tracked down the Manjunath and Ranganath. “On questioning them, they realised that the duo had repeated this scam multiple times and taken loans in other people’s names,” said a senior police official. The police have also recovered two high-end cars from the duo.

Ravi Kumar said the accused were working as agents for executives for a private bank in loan section. Using their expertise and contacts with the bank officials, the duo ganged up and started luring people.

They contacted people who had approached the bank for loans and posed as builders. They took potential buyers to under-construction residential apartments in Bengaluru, and offered to help them to get bank loans.

“Some gullible people submitted their KYC and other documents which the accused would submit to banks and take loans in the potential buyer’s names. However, they ensured that the money was transferred to their accounts. It’s surprising that the banks failed to verify such documents and sanctioned the loans without following due procedure,” Mr. Kumar added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/m50pq9/article30526221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09CONMENREALESTATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/conmen-pose-as-builders-dupe-customers-banks-of-20-crore/article30526222.ece
412,2020/01/09,Karnataka bird festival to come to Bengaluru,"Bengaluru is now set to play host to the Karnataka Bird Festival for the first time.

Bird Festival 2020, which will be the sixth edition of the event, will be held at Nandi Hills from January 17 to 19. The event has been organised by the Karnataka Forest Department, the Karnataka Eco Tourism Development Board, and My Eco Trip, which is under the board.

According to the organisers, Nandi Hills boasts of having more than 200 species of birds — a treat to bird watchers for spotting unusual birds like black baza, blue-headed rock thrush, white-throated ground thrush, Eurasian blackbird, pied thrush, Indian blue robin, ultramarine flycatcher, spotted babbler, Malabar whistling thrush, Niligiri woodpigeon, and many species of migrant warblers.

But much of the focus of the event will be on the endangered species of vultures — nature’s clean-up crew.

Syed Mohammed Abid, project lead, My Eco Trip, said Bengaluru, being the capital, would attract larger crowds.

“We want to use this opportunity to educate them about the endangered species of vultures and other rare birds sighted around Nandi Hills. We recently held a butterfly festival in Bengaluru in 2019,” he said.

Among the sessions and events lined up are: ‘Vulture Conservation in India: Issues and Initiatives, Conservation Breeding programme of vultures’, ‘Saving Asia’s Vultures from Extinction’, ‘Birds of Inland Hills of Karnataka and the uniqueness of Nandi Hills’, ‘Bird Photography’, ‘Conservation of Spot-billed Pelican at Kokkarebellur Community Reserve with changing time and attitudes’, ‘Trends in Illegal wildlife trade — Focus on Birds, Mysuru City Bird Atlas: A systematic study of birds across space and time’, and ‘Birds, Tribals, and Conservation’.

There are 150 slots available and the entrance fee for three days is ₹600 (excluding taxes) which includes meals and transportation from accommodation nearby.

Details are available on the My Eco Trip website.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/karnataka-bird-festival-to-come-to-bengaluru/article30526056.ece
413,2020/01/09,Declare Hesarghatta as a conservation reserve: environmental activists to CM,"With the BJP government reinstating the proposal to set up a film city in Bengaluru, and the name of Hesaraghatta cropping up again, environmental activists are gearing up for a fresh battle.

A section of them are writing to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa urging the government to drop the 345-acre grassland as a possible location for the film city or other projects on the grounds that development activity would pose a threat to animal farms in the area.

“It could pose a biosecurity hazard to the various animal farms in the area and we have strongly recommended protection of the grasslands,” said excerpts from the letter written to the Chief Minister.

Reservoir of biodiversity

Environmentalists have pointed out that the Hesaraghatta lakebed area and grasslands in the surrounding catchment area are an important reservoir of biodiversity and a refuge for endangered wildlife species like the lesser florican and leopard, yet remain outside the protected area network and face severe threats to its biodiversity.

“This area is a large carbon sink for our city and can be a powerful tool to mitigate climate change and counter the rapid urbanisation of Bengaluru. The landscape surrounding the lakebed is the last remaining grassland habitat in the Bengaluru region and supports unique biodiversity. The Hesaraghatta Lake was an important source of drinking water to the city till 1994 and could be revived as a catchment area,” they said in the letter.

They have also brought it to the notice of the Chief Minister the 2012 PIL petition filed by the Arkavathy Mathu Kumudvathy Nadi Punaschetana Samithi in the High Court of Karnataka objecting to a similar proposal as the land is an important catchment of Arkavathy / Hesaraghatta reservoir. “The petition was closed when the government gave an undertaking to preserve the land,” said one of the environmentalists who is party to the letter.

They have also explained that the greater Hesaraghatta area, not limited to the 345 acres of grassland, is an ecologically sensitive zone and a necessary part of the community livelihood as local farmers graze their cattle.

Conservation reserve

“We have submitted multiple proposals to the Forest Department to declare the 5,000 acres as a Conservation Reserve under section 36A of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. We believe that it is the only way we can ensure that this area remains as it is. We request you not to consider this area for building a film city,” the letter concludes.

Forest Department officials, however, have maintained that similar plans are in the offing. A senior officer told The Hindu that the proposal to convert the grasslands into a conservation reserve are afloat and it is likely to be brought up in the next meeting of the Wildlife Board.

414,2020/01/09,BBMP denies permission for avarekai mela at V.V. Puram,"The civic body has denied permission for the annual avarekai mela at V.V. Puram, citing lack of hygiene and solid-waste management facilities at the event. The privately organised food festival has attained a large following over the decade.

Several residents of the area had complained to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike over the waste generated and how it blocked the main road causing inconvenience to them as well as motorists. “There have been complaints of inconvenience over the last three years. Moreover, it is a commercial programme by a private individual and the civic body has no obligation to facilitate it,” said Vani V. Rao, councillor, Visveswarapuram.

She said Vasavi Condiments, the store which organises the mela, was very small but the festival occupies most of the road. “Organising it there will only inconvenience citizens. We will not allow them to organise the festival on V.V. Puram food street. They can rent out a ground or any other public venue from the civic body, which we will welcome,” she said.

However, K.S. Swathi, the organiser of the mela, said she was keen on organising the event at V.V. Puram food street itself, and was talking to BBMP health officials to assure them that they would follow all solid-waste management norms. “We will also ensure that the residents and commuters are not inconvenienced,” she said. “Renting out a venue would make the festival unviable. There are over 500 farmers who regularly supply avarekai to the mela,” she said.

For now, however, BBMP has denied permission. “Avarekai mela has become a part of the city’s tradition. But it is also a private commercial event and people cannot be put to discomfort. I have directed local officials to take a call keeping both aspects in mind,” said Sarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid-Waste Management, BBMP.

415,2020/01/09,300 trucks stuck at Mittaganahalli quarry unable to unload garbage,"The solid-waste management crisis came to a head on Thursday after 300 trucks carrying the detritus of Bengaluru were stranded at Mittaganahalli quarry pit.

The landfill is almost 90% full, and by Wednesday the mounds of garbage became unstable, and started sliding. Since then, truck after truck, laden with waste, have been queuing up outside the landfill, some for as long as 30 hours. However, dumping commenced at 9 p.m. on Thursday. BBMP officials said the operation will be over soon.

Dumping had been temporarily stopped, and collection in many parts of Bengaluru, such as K.R. Puram and Vidyaranyapuram, were affected on Thursday, resulting in unattended waste lying strewn on roadsides. S. Prasad, a resident of K.R. Puram said: “We were informed that the dry waste would not be collected. Already blackspots are cropping up in the area.”

Acknowledging that the quarry pit was fast filling up, D. Randeep, BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management), said, “Measures to solve the problem are being worked out. The pit is 90% full. We are expecting to use it for at least a month more. As the Urban Development Department rejected the tender for setting up a scientific landfill at Mittaganahalli, we are planning for another quick tender. We will decide on it soon,” he said.

Truck drivers expressed their anger and frustration over the situation. “Generally, we come here at around 11 a.m. and unload the garbage and go back within two to three hours. However, since we are not allowed to unload the garbage, we have been stuck here for more than 30 hours now,” said one driver.

After the closure of Bellahalli quarry pit around three months ago, the civic body has been using the small landfill at Mittaganahalli as a temporary arrangement to dump mixed waste.

V. Ramaprasad, Solid-Waste Management expert said the city was supposed to have achieved at least 80-90% segregation of waste by the end of 2019. “We are far from achieving it. It is high time that both the BBMP and citizens take the initiative seriously. We are heading towards a major garbage crisis again,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/7o8lhh/article30525012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09GARBAGE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/300-trucks-stuck-at-mittaganahalli-quarry-unable-to-unload-garbage/article30525013.ece
416,2020/01/09,BIFFes from February 26 to March 4,"The twelfth edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) will be held from February 26 to March 4 in the city.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa at a press conference on Thursday, said it will be held at Orion Mall, Rajajinagar, the venue of the festival from 2016. There will be no screening of films in Mysuru. The inauguration will be on a grand scale at Kanteerava Indoor Stadium on February 26.

The announcement of the festival has been much delayed this year, raising fears of it hampering the organisation of the festival. Sunil Puranik, the new chairman of Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, said there has been a delay in the work for the festival, owing to the delay in the change of leadership of the academy.

“I took charge a week ago and we have begun work in earnest. We will ensure there are no issues with the festival,” he said. BiFFes is usually held in the first and second weeks of February.

Every edition of BIFFes focuses on cinema from two countries and has films on a particular theme, which are yet to be decided for this edition of the festival. N. Vidyashankar, creative director, BIFFes 2020, said while they began curating the festival a few days ago, the country focus and theme were yet to be decided. “We can write to people only once the dates are finalised, which has happened now,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/biffes-from-february-26-to-march-4/article30524671.ece
417,2020/01/09,"Religion should never be criteria for citizenship, says Archbishop of Bengaluru","Appealing to the Central Government to grant citizenship to illegal migrants not on the basis of their religions but on the merit of each individual case, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Bengaluru Peter Machado told presspersons on Thursday that a memorandum in this regard was being presented to the Prime Minister and President of India, through the Governor of Karnataka.

“We wish to reiterate the statement made by the Archbishop of Bombay, Oswald Cardinal Gracias, who is the head of the Catholic Church in India, on December 27th regarding CAA that there is a danger of polarisation of people along religious lines, which is very harmful for the country.

“Religion should never be the criterion for citizenship of a country. Nor is violence a solution when there is a difference of opinion. It is necessary that the government dialogues with those opposing the Act, and comes to an agreement about the way forward with justice, equity and fairness. There is no harm in backtracking or changing course if this is necessary for the good of the country and our people,” he said.

“By doing so the government can mete out justice to all the illegal migrants, thus promote equality among them. More so, it can also convince the citizens of the country that it upholds the sacredness of the Constitution and respects the rights of all linguistic and religious minorities without any discrimination,” he said.

“Through this memorandum, we wish to stress that the Christian community will continue to work for the betterment of all citizens without any discrimination and will continue to build the nation based on equality, justice and fairness. We also express our solidarity with those who have been discriminated on the basis of religion and assure them of our support and fellowship,” he added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/religion-should-never-be-criteria-for-citizenship-says-archbishop-of-bengaluru/article30522147.ece

421,2020/01/09,DMK MLA seeks reopening of Krishna Gate at IIT Madras,"DMK Velachery legislator Vagai Chanderasekar on Thursday urged the State government to prevail upon the authorities of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT Madras), to reopen the Krishna gate. This would benefit flow of vehicular traffic from and to Velachery and nearby areas to benefit students and the general public, he said in the Legislative Assembly.

During the question hour, Mr. Chanderasekar said agricultural lands in the area were acquired for setting up the IIT Madras in 1964. People, especially members of the Adi Dravidar community and students in the vicinity, were using the gate until it was closed overnight last month.

“Since the gate was closed, they have to take a circuitous longer route to reach their destinations. Students from Vanavani and Kendriya Vidyalaya schools within the IIT Madras campus are affected,” Mr. Chanderasekar pointed out.

Requesting the government to understand the sensitive feelings of people in the area, the Velachery MLA urged the State government to intervene in the issue, though the IIT was a Central government institution.

In his reply, School Education Minister K.A.

422,2020/01/09,Popular football ground in north Chennai to get new artificial turf,"North Chennai's popular football ground in Mullai Nagar is getting new artificial turf.

This part of the city is known for its love for football. The turf had worn out almost a year ago but it did not stop children and youth from playing their favourite game at the ground, though it put them at risk of injury.

More than 300 children and youth of areas including Kalayanapuram, Sathyamurthy Nagar and M.K.B.Nagar train at the ground throughout the week. ""Though the turf was badly damaged, we continued to train here. The Corporation has started work to lay new turf. The old turf has been removed. We are now playing in a nearby ground in Samandhipoo Colony. It has natural turf but is also in need of maintenance,"" said one of the players.

The players train for an hour in the morning and from 4 p.m. during week days, and from 6.30 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. during weekends. Now, Chennai Corporation has taken up works to replace the old turf.

The players said that it was important to level the ground well before laying the new turf. Otherwise, it could lead to water stagnation during rains and the turf could bulge. The players also pointed out that the ground at Samandhipoo Colony lacked proper maintenance and had no security.

Officials of Chennai Corporation said they have removed the old turf at the Mullai Nagar ground and are taking up levelling work now. “We are waiting for material purchase. The turf is available in Bengaluru. Once we get it, the work will be completed in two weeks. We are hoping to get it ready in February,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/h1l7x9/article30521350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MULLAINAGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/popular-football-ground-in-north-chennai-to-get-new-artificial-turf/article30521351.ece
423,2020/01/09,Chennai Corpn. to lay footpath along Marina Loop Road,"The Greater Chennai Corporation on Wednesday informed the Madras High Court about having sent a letter to the Coastal Zone Management Authority seeking permission for laying a footpath for morning walkers on the beach side of the Loop Road on Marina beach.

Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar, Additional Advocate General S.R. Rajagopal said the Corporation had decided to lay the footpath on the entire stretch of the Loop Road commencing from Foreshore Estate to the Light House.

A letter seeking permission had also been addressed to the CZMA. After perusing the letter, the judges directed Central Government Senior Standing Counsel J. Madhanagopal Rao to obtain instructions from CZMA by January 22 on the status of the Corporation’s request.

The judges also directed the Corporation to ﬁle a detailed status report by that date on the steps taken by it to streamline the vendors on the beach and how it had decided to go about identifying the hawkers. The process for issuing identity cards and steel carts should also be explained.

Clean up

It was while hearing a case ﬁled by Fishermen Care, a non-governmental organisation, that the judges had questioned the Corporation authorities for not maintaining the beach. They insisted on shifting the ﬁshsellers on the Loop Road to a proper marketplace.

Accordingly, the Corporation identiﬁed a large piece of land for establishing the market but could not convince the ﬁshsellers to shift there.

424,2020/01/09,Disquiet in AIADMK over silence on JNU mob attack,"The AIADMK leadership should have condemned the attack on students and teachers on the Jawaharlal Nehru University campus on Sunday. Its continued silence will only give more credence to the criticism of the Opposition that the party is “subservient” to the BJP, according to many veterans in the party.

“You do not have to mention specifically against or in favour of any party or organisation. But a mere statement that we are against violence of any form and the attack on the students and teachers is condemnable, would have sent out a strong message,” say the members.

These members, many of whom are functionaries, point out that there is a strong perception in certain quarters that the AIADMK regime is toeing what the BJP-led government at the Centre has been doing.

Even though Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami or Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar has, at times, publicly clarified on many occasions that the State government’s position is at variance with that of the Centre, be it on the language issue or the NEET issue, the impression that the AIADMK regime goes “out of the way to be accommodative” of the Union government’s stand has not been “effectively erased,” they say.

Citizenship law

Already, there is a view in certain quarters of the party that the controversy over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is one of the factors that have adversely affected the interests of the party in the recent elections to rural local bodies. This was publicly articulated by former Member of Parliament A. Anwhar Raajahaa last week.

The senior members say the party could not afford to lose the support of minorities in the forthcoming polls to urban local bodies and other rural local bodies.

Analysing the outcome of the rural local body polls, they said the wrong choice of candidates, “favouritism” by the party’s secretaries at the levels of district and panchayat unions with regard to distribution of party ticket and lack of coordination among the functionaries and others are among the reasons for the poor performance of the AIADMK in certain districts. Anti-incumbency is another major factor. Even though the DMK is said to have experienced the same problem of “favouritism,” the AIADMK’s position had been weakened by its relationship with the Centre.

The senior members are not suggesting any confrontation with the BJP or the Central government but they say that the leadership should, in a sustained manner, make it clear that the party's support cannot be taken for granted by the BJP. Besides, it should hold extensive discussions with district-level functionaries, just as former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa did in 1997 and 2004, for motivating the party cadre and addressing the problem of “disconnect.”

Asked about the “silence” of the party leadership on the JNU violence, Marudhu Alaguraj, one of the spokespersons of the AIADMK, said his party’s principle position was that it did not favour violence in any form.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/disquiet-in-aiadmk-over-silence-on-jnu-mob-attack/article30520265.ece

The firm intends to utilise the funds for its expansion to newer markets, which includes Coimbatore, Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

“Our target is 100 stores in five years. Apart from expansion, the bulk of this funding will also be utilised to strengthen our operations and supply chain management,” Jahabar Sadique, CEO of Chai Kings, said. Currently, Chai Kings sells over 25,000 cups of tea per day, including deliveries and corporate orders. On an average, 7.5 lakh cups of various kinds of tea are sold per month through its 40 stores.

Getting basics right

“Chennai was always a coffee and tea market. There is so much demand for chai in this market,” Mr. Sadique told The Hindu. “When we started our journey in 2016, the biggest challenge we saw was accessibility, consistency and right price point. We got all the three right and it worked well for us,” he added.

Piyush Bhandari, founder, Intuit Management Consultancy, who lead the investment from TCA, said, “We believe the company has a strong leadership team with immense potential to grow and expand across India. The new investment reiterates our commitment towards building a sustainable and scalable Indian Quick Service Restaurant.” For The Chennai Angels, this is the first investment for 2020. In 2018, Chai Kings had secured ₹2 crore as funding from TCA.

428,2020/01/09,Metrowater aims to supply water to all parts of city equally,"With inflows of Krishna water assured till February-end, Metrowater plans to supply water equally across the city. At present, Chennai is being provided 650 million litres on alternate days or once in three days in some areas.

Though there is sufficient storage in the reservoirs to last till the next southwest monsoon, Metrowater officials noted that they were in no hurry to step up water supply. “We want to optimise the use of available resources to provide equitable water supply to even tail-end areas. A study has been launched to find out means to increase water pressure and ensure supply to all households,” said an official.

With areas such as Avadi, Pammal and Anakaputhur to be brought into the ambit of Metrowater supply, the water agency is preparing a mix of different water sources and distribution patterns to sustain drinking water supply to both core and added areas. “There is a need for a rational plan to distribute the available resources for a longer period,” the official said.

High volumes

Since last September, the city has so far received one of the highest volumes of Krishna water from Andhra Pradesh since 2011. Poondi reservoir, which is the storage point for the inflows, has received 4,212 million cubic feet (mcft) of Krishna water. This is equivalent to five months’ supply to the city.

A senior WRD official said, “AP authorities have assured us water supply till February-end. But, we expect supply to continue till the end of April and help boost storage in city reservoirs.”

In 2011-12, Chennai received 8,198 mcft of Krishna water in two spells. Krishna water has helped to increase storage to about 50% of reservoirs’ capacity and resume drawal from the waterbodies, the official added.

Last November, Metrowater started the process of supplying piped water to about 3,000 streets. The number of lorry trips also came down to 4,000 trips daily, from a whopping 12,300 in November.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ta0pct/article30518269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THPOONDIRESERVOIRANDSATHYAMOORTHYSAGARDAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/metrowater-aims-to-supply-water-to-all-parts-of-city-equally/article30518270.ece

The decision means an extra show can be added by exhibitors for six days, besides the four normal shows, in 700 screens in the State. It remains to be seen, however, if the State government will clamp down on ‘early morning’ shows in theatres outside city limits for which tickets are usually sold at exorbitant rates.

Tiruppur Subramaniam, leading distributor and exhibitor, said it would be tough to stop malpractices, and blamed top stars for charging hefty amounts which are then passed down to the consumer.

432,2020/01/09,Pongal festivities begin at VIT,"Pongal festivities began at the Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore with founder and chancellor G. Viswanathan inaugurating the celebrations in a traditional manner.

He mixed rice, jaggery, pulses, cardamom and cashew nuts in a traditional clay pot, in symbolic preparation of the dish, pongal.

The festival is celebrated every year at VIT with the participation of students, faculty and management and non-teaching staff. It is organised each year by Paavendhar Bharathidasan Tamil Literary Association and VIT School of Agricultural Innovations and Advanced Learning.

Students from different countries took part in the celebrations, wearing traditional clothes — saree and dhoti — of Tamil Nadu.

Traditional artforms of Karagattam, Oyilattam and Puli Vesham, performed by troupes brought in from Thanjavur and Tiruvannamalai, stole the hearts of participating students and guests present on the occasion.

Chief Guest of the function Yogacharya S. Nilamegame from Reunion Island said that there were about three lakh Tamils, following Tamil culture and celebrating festivals like Pongal and Deepavali, in Reunion Island.

“We have people from various countries like China, Africa and France living together with Tamils in Reunion Island,” he added. He invited people from India to visit Reunion Island, an island nation that lies between Madagascar and Mauritius.

Mr. Viswanathan said that Tamil is spoken in about 150 countries in the world, including Reunion Island. In 30 nations, it is spoken in large numbers, he added.

There are about 7,000 languages spoken in the world and of them, seven — Latin, Greek, Persian, Hebrew, Tamil, Sanskrit and Chinese — are the oldest, having existed for over 2,000 years. “Of these seven languages, some have become outdated and few have transformed. But not Tamil and Chinese. Chinese is about 1,000 years younger than Tamil,” he said.

“India is the only country in world which has so many languages. As per the 2011 Census, we have 121 major spoken languages and 19,500 dialects. But we have recognised only 22 languages,” he said.

Pointing out that he was instrumental in starting Tamiliyakam in October 2018 with an objective to develop Tamil and create awareness about the language among people in various countries, he said that VIT and Tamiliyakam will take necessary steps to develop and preserve Tamil in various countries, including Reunion Island.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/azl0xb/article30518187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH08VITPONGAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pongal-festivities-begin-at-vellore-institute-of-technology/article30518188.ece
433,2020/01/09,"Bandh brings work at Central govt. offices, PSUs to a halt","Work at Central government offices in the city was crippled on Wednesday as most employees were on strike in view of the bandh called by trade unions.

It is estimated that over 30,000 employees participated in the strike across the city.

The participation in the strike was 100% in post offices, nationalised banks, BSNL offices, Income Tax offices in Nungambakkam and Tambaram, Life Insurance Corporation offices, Indian Council of Medical Research, Heavy Vehicles Factory and other public sector undertakings. Staff of Southern Railway, Integral Coach Factory and Kalpakkam power plant also staged demonstrations reiterating their charter of demands.

At Anna Salai, leaders of central trade unions (CTUs) such as Centre of Indian Trade Unions(CITU), All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), Labour Progressive Federation (LPF) and unorganised workers’ unions gathered and blocked the road. The activists squatted on the road and shouted slogans seeking reversal of anti-worker, anti-people and anti-national policies of the Modi government.

LPF General Secretary M. Shanmugam said the government, after failing to tackle a crisis-ridden economy, was busy privatising and selling public sector undertakings, natural resources and other national assets, a move that was detrimental to national interest and national development.

Protesters had a heated exchange with the police when the latter attempted to remove them from Anna Salai. Police forcibly removed them and bundled them into vehicles. Mr. Shanmugam and CITU leader A.Soundararjan were detained by the police. Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalan was also detained as he and his party members staged a protest on Anna Salai.

Employees of banks and BSNL had their agitation near Chennai Collectorate. C.H. Venkatachalam, All India Bank Employees' Association General Secretary, said over 8 lakh cheque transactions were affected in the city due to the strike. Though banks were open, staff did not attend to their duties and banking services were completely crippled.

M.Durai Pandian, general secretary of confederation of Central government employees and workers’ union said that over one lakh Central government employees participated in the strike all over Tamil Nadu.

In Tiruvottiyur, CPI(M) Central committee member G.Ramakrishnan with members of CITU took out a procession towards the post office. They were later detained by the police. Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S.Alagiri also took part in the agitation by members of a labour union before Perambur Loco Works.

Sivanarul here on Tuesday.

The packets will be distributed to eligible cardholders on Thursday, said an official from the District Supply Office.

Hilly terrain

The village has a population of over 700 and with about 200 ration card holders. The village on a hilly terrain lacks adequate road facility.

Villagers would collect the government subsidy items from Girisamudhiram village in Alangayam block located at the bottom of the hill.

Villagers have demanded for improved road connectivity to Girisamudhiram. Mr. Sivanarul once visited the hilltop by trekking seven km to give a hearing of their grievances.

The DC said that steps were underway to provide road facility to the village. Experts’ opinions are being solicited by the district administration for the construction of a road without compromising the eco-system.

Items in hamper

Rice cardholders can avail the Pongal gifts through ration shops from January 9. According to the official communication from the district administration, this year, people would get one kg each of rice and jaggery, a two-ft. long sugarcane, 20g each of cashew nuts and raisins, 5g cardamom and ₹1,000 in cash.

According to a a Corporation official, ₹1.95 lakh was due from the three traders in Sathuvachari. The official said that several reminders seeking payment of rent were issued as per the existing rules, but were not complied with.

The team then proceeded to Nethaji Market to seal three more shops, which owed ₹1.35 lakh. The team led by N. Madhivanan, Assistant Commissioner for Zone 2, Vellore Corporation, directed officials to take action against the defaulters and ordered for shops to be sealed.

“This is not an isolated case of a defaulter’s shop being sealed. On earlier occasions, many traders have come forward to remit rental dues after their shops were sealed,” said an official. He added that the defaulting traders have to pay a penalty over and above the rental dues.

There are about 2,500 shops inside the Corporation limits and many traders have not been paying rent for years. In a recent review meeting held at Chennai, the municipalities and town panchayats have been asked to improve and generate their own sources of income. Collecting property tax and rental payments from shops and commercial establishments are hence being given priority now.

The arrested have been identified as Subash, former employee of the fuel station who shot the video on his mobile phone, K. Maruthachalam, reporter of a Tamil channel who allegedly used the video for a news report on a YouTube channel and a 35-year-old man from Rathinapuri, the husband of one the victims, who shared the video with the reporter.

A press release by the Coimbatore city police said that the incident took place four months ago at a fuel station run by Roots Industries near Kannappa Nagar.

One of the women found the mobile phone in the changing room and informed her husband. They later deleted the video and damaged the mobile phone. However, Subash allegedly kept a copy, which the Rathinapuri resident obtained from him on January 8 and shared with the reporter.

The police said that they did not register a case with regard to the incident earlier as none of the affected women lodged a complaint. “They lodged a complaint with the Saibaba Colony police on Wednesday after seeing the video in a web channel named Kovai Media 24/7,” said a police officer.

A section of media persons had also petitioned the Coimbatore City Police Commissioner Sumit Sharan on Wednesday demanding action against the reporter for using the leaked video for a report.

Meanwhile, the Saravanampatty police registered a case against four persons, including a director of Roots Industries for alleged assault on the 35-year-old man who allegedly shared the leaked video with the reporter.

437,2020/01/09,Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam pontiff releases book on Mahaperiyava,"The second volume of the book Embodiment of Truth - Kanchi Mahaswami, brought out by The Hindu, was released on Wednesday by Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam pontiff Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati. January 8 also happens to be Sri Chandrasekarendra Saraswati Swamigal's (Mahaperiyava) 26th Siddhi day.

Releasing the book at a Shraddhanjali to Mahaperiyava organised by Veda Pata Nidhi Trust at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, the pontiff said that just as Perumal took Lord Rama’s avatar to rid the world of evil, Mahaperiyava was born when the country needed a guru for liberation, salvation, for cultural uplift. Mahaperiyava was for national and spiritual unity and worked to create a world without hatred.

He said The Hindu had brought out two volumes on Mahaperiyava by compiling articles from its archives and said that the publishers should bring out more books in the series.

Former Solicitor General of India Gopal Subramanium said that The Hindu Group was known for its archives. Former Attorney General of India K. Parasaran, The Hindu Group Publisher N. Ravi and Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (Chennai Kendra) Director K.N. Ramaswamy were present on the occasion.

The first volume of the Embodiment of Truth narrated the birth of Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, his anointment as the 68th head of the Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam and his first Vijaya Yatra.

The second part travels with the sage on more marathon journeys — all for social welfare and the preservation of Sanatana Dharma.

Copious photographs

Supported with copious clippings and photographs from The Hindu archives, the second volume covers about six decades of one of the most revered spiritual leaders who had followers not only in India but all over the world.

438,2020/01/09,Saarang opens on a traditional note,"The Indian Institute of Technology's annual cultural festival has become glitzier and now has an international flavour to it. From the MardiGras of the eighties to Saarang, it has been quite a transformation. The inauguration on Wednesday evening was completely traditional with the lighting of the lamp and a performance by an all-male team of musicians.

The students of the institute rendered a classical Hindustani composition. A group of seven students — three vocalists, one on the tabla and another on the flute, a student on the guitar and another on the keyboard completed the ensemble. It was as if the audience was going to be treated to Hindustani fusion of sorts. But the performance was all Hindustani, eliciting spontaneous appreciation from the audience which itself was a medley of the elderly, children and college students.

The four-day extravaganza began with dramatics — what the students call their ‘flagship event’. Four teams from IIT-M, Madras Christian College, Anna University, Madras University and Ethiraj College presented 60-minute skits. On Thursday, the competition will see the participation of eight teams from other parts of the country.

‘Madras Memoirs’

The theme this year is Madras Memoirs — revisiting the city that houses the institute. Veena exponent Rajesh Vaidhya performed at the inauguration.

In another development, the Department of Engineering Design of IIT-M received ₹1 crore from an alumnus, who wished to remain anonymous, to establish a state-of-the-art robotics research and teaching laboratory.

439,2020/01/09,"A multilateral alternative, by Asia","After a gap of 200 years, Asian economies are again larger than the rest of the world’s combined. As India and China resolve their border dispute, Asia is providing the multilateral alternative to a world divided by values, and no longer by ideology.

The phrase ‘Asian Century’ is said to have arisen in the 1988 meeting between Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, re-establishing relations after the India-China border conflict in 1962. It responds to the re-emergence of the two countries, leveraging size and technological competence to shape a new order that reflects their civilisational values which are distinct from those of the West. The travails of the West, for example, stagnating incomes of the middle class and also climate change, confirm that the global division is now based on values, as has been the case throughout civilisation. Even notions of a balance of power are a western construct, as the Asian giants have by and large lived in peace across the ages.

China, in 2013, after attaining 15% of global wealth, announced the multilateral Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and in 2014, launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, challenging the global governance paradigm. In 2015, emerging India established the International Solar Alliance, laying out a distinct global sustainable development framework, and seeking a triumvirate.

The United States has recognised the ‘Asian Century’ bypassing multilateralism; its direct dealings with China and India and the Indo-Pacific construct are examples. The way the U.S. defined human rights solely in political and procedural terms, withdrew from climate change after shifting the burden onto developing countries and the forced inclusion of intellectual property rights into the trade regime illustrate the colonial origins of current multilateralism now being questioned by even its proponents and not just by Asia.

New frameworks

The decisive shift responds both to the Asian growth engine and to Asian technology. Global competition is moving away from country-specific actions to fragmented competition, transformed by global value chains accounting for three-quarters of the growth in global trade over the 20-year period: 1993-2013. There is no provision in global trade rules for company-specific concerns where the global digital economy rather than countries are determinants of wealth and power. Imposing U.S.-determined national security standards on the world has led to only a handful of countries agreeing to ban Huawei 5G technology, has angered Europe over sanctions on companies building a gas pipeline from Russia; sanctions on Iran have affected India’s interests, impacting long-term relations and forcing a tacit choice between the two systems.

China, which had never been fully colonised and is keen to get rich quick, has a head start over India in laying out a new multilateralism based on “common interests” as different from agreed goals of a negotiated treaty. The BRI bilateral agreements optimise, not maximise, financial returns with countries having an effective veto by remaining outside. Countries support the BRI — it covers the territories of 72 countries and 70% of the world population — as a network-based evolving process even with market-based interest rates because of benefits of connectivity and integration into Eurasian markets. Half of future BRI funding is expected from multinational corporations and multilateral banks, adding to their stake in solving difficulties.

Potential of BRI

The BRI provides a strategic framework for new global institution building as its scope is as wide as multilateral treaties. For example, state-owned enterprises in infrastructure sectors in the BRI, with backing from national banks, are contributing to internationalisation of the Renminbi, enhancing China’s role in global economic governance.

As the world leader in digital transactions China is developing block chain-based financial infrastructure in BRI countries and exploring an international block-chain currency for digital settlements without relying on the dollar, thus reducing U.S. leverage.

With the speed and scale of such change, rising Asia remains wary of China and is eager, as is China, that India joins the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, poised to become the world’s largest trading bloc because of the huge Indian market. With the U.S. military ‘pivot to Asia’, China is keen to resolve the border dispute with India to avoid constraints. The recent India-China Summit on boundary issues resolved to work out a “framework on a roadmap to a final solution on border issues”; India has rejected American opposition to Huawei taking part in 5G trials. The Indian government has allowed all applicants, including Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd, to participate.

New values

The contours of the new order should not be seen through a western prism. In 2018, China was the largest supplier of goods to the U.S.; it has also been India’s major trading partner. Every big state has bilateral relations with all three, and they take part in limited sectoral cooperation on a regional basis. Even faraway NATO has recently discussed the implications of the rise of China; China, like India, is not part of any collective security system. Both the U.S. and China have regular high-level discussions on strategic issues with India, recognising its demographic, technological and resource potential to be part of a future global triumvirate.

What are the implications of this state of flux? Asia formed two-thirds of world GDP, and colonialism, not stagnation, led to a decline of the Asian giants. Their re-emergence is not part of a global transformation of “westernization”. The border problem, too, is a remnant of colonialism and not the result of aggression.

Clearly, the U.S., China and India will retain their civilisational models into the future. In Asia, differences will centre on overlapping priorities — security (the U.S.’s efforts to maintain hegemony), economic (China’s emphasis on connectivity, markets and growth) and equitable sustainable development (India-led framework of digital infrastructure designed as a public good). By 2030, there is every possibility of a triumvirate

Asia, and Africa, former colonies with conditions closer to India than to China, are waiting for late-comer India, a civilisational state like China, to lay out its vision of a digital, cooperative, sustainable multilateral strategic framework to complement the frameworks of the other two powers. Early concrete moves for their simultaneous rise are in the global interest.

440,2020/01/09,Campus notes,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University Vice-Chancellor’s so-called words of solace appear to be more in the nature of rubbing salt into the wound (Inside pages, “Bury the past and return to the varsity, JNU V-C tells students”, January 8). He appears to be remorseless and shows complete insensitivity after the attacks by marauders and goons. He speaks nothing about going after the culprits, bringing them to book and punishing those responsible for laxity in security. His words almost amount to this: ‘Some of you deserved it, now commit yourself to behaving properly and let us together put it behind us and move on with the future.’

M.A. Siraj,

It is appalling that there is growing mass violence in our country. India which has a brilliant past of being a centre for knowledge seekers, is now finding its centres of learning being muddied by politics and violence. India, a democracy, does not require Tiananmen Square-like protests or student unrest which may have found an outlet in several non-democratic countries. Much of the strife seems to be politically motivated or has political backing. Political leaders may benefit from all this, but not the student or the teacher. Socio-economic factors may cause conflicts in the minds of students to fester and have to be addressed with resoluteness. All political leaders must join hands to resolve this peacefully and by unity, i.e., if these leaders have national interests uppermost in their mind. In the process, the democratic system in our country will be strengthened.

One gets a feeling that political leaders in India are seeking cover as proponents of the Gandhian philosophy but, instead, are seen to be enjoying the advantages that may accrue from political chaos. Celebrities and people in the public domain seem to taking sides.The media in India, without doubt, needs course correction, and has to be objective and impartial. If we do not address these issues urgently, India may face more tumultuous times in the future which will impact everyone.

It was chilling to see and read about the violence on the JNU campus with many getting beaten black and blue and running hither and thither to save their lives. It is also saddening to note the police remaining mute. I would earnestly request the Prime Minister to make a statement. The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, would have been stunned and petrified by the ugly scenes.

Mani Natraajan,

Chennai

I was a JNU student at the beginning of this millennium, where my friends and I formed a small progressive group called ‘WE’. The first poster of ‘WE’ had a quote from Kancha Illia’s book, Why I Am Not A Hindu. The poster was torn off by the so-called protectors of Indian culture. Somehow, after this, we were not ready to go ahead with such revolutionary ideas, and ‘WE’ withered away with its very first poster. I often wonder why the poster was torn off instead of all of us confronting the ideas expressed in the poster democratically.

Our secular democracy has gradually failed to inculcate a culture of tolerance and after Jawaharlal Nehru, it is not ready to accommodate dissent. The right’s rise and intolerance are only because of the inherent weakness of the so-called secular parties, including the Left, which have used secularism to garner minority votes.

444,2020/01/09,What’s cooking this Sankranti?,"Uttarayan in Gujarat, Lohri and Maghi in Punjab, and Pana Sankranti in Odisha are essentially celebrations for the same reason, but each is a different kaleidoscope of rituals, traditions and food. When it comes to food, ingredients like sesame seeds aka til, jaggery, rice, groundnuts, harvest vegetables and sugarcane are quintessential. Here is a look at some regional delicacies prepared on this special day.

Sesame post-solstice

A highly significant festival that marks the passing of the winter solstice, Maghi in Punjab is celebrated with great fervour. The day before is celebrated with a bonfire as Lohri, and it is customary to consume the produce from the new harvest during this day. Apart from sarson da saag and gur ki roti, til ki barfi (sesame seed cake) is a signature preparation in this region. It is a crunchy delight made from the goodness of roasted sesame which is ground, jaggery, pure ghee and a hint of cardamom.

“Makar Shankranti is incomplete without til-gud. It is a tradition that dates over 100 years and every household makes sweets with these two ingredients. Til and gud also have medicinal properties, so it is believed to keep the body warm and increase immunity,” says chef Rudra, The Reservoire, Bengaluru.

Undhiyu for Uttarayan

Cultural vibrance, kite flying, peanut chikkis and undhiyu — arguably Gujarat’s most famous dish — dominate Makar Sankranti in the State. Undhiyu literally means ‘upside down’, and is an assortment of freshly grown vegetables like surti papdi (hyacinth beans), kand (purple yam), sweet potatoes, raw bananas, tuvar (pigeon peas), brinjal and potatoes. “The dish, which has several variations, enjoys a cult status in Gujarat,” says Hetal Shah, a homemaker from Surat.

Til ki barfi Ingredients

200 gms grated jaggery

200 gms white sesame seeds

5-6 tbsp pure ghee

1 tsp cardamom powder

Method

Roast the sesame seeds for 2-3 minutes in a non-stick pan till it changes its colour to golden brown. Allow to cool. Grind half of the quantity in a mixer and keep it aside. Take a pan, add pure ghee and grated jaggery. Add 2-3 tablespoons of water. Let the jaggery dissolve completely. Add cardamom powder. It will start forming bubbles. Now add the ground sesame seeds and cook for a while. When it gets mixed properly, add the rest of the sesame seeds. Cool it down and set in a tray. After 30 minutes, cut it diagonally and it is ready.

The elaborate dish also involves the preparation of methi muthiyas (steamed or deep-fried fenugreek leaf dumplings) cooked along with the vegetables in a medley of aromatic, heat-generating spices like ginger, garlic, coconut and green chillies. “Undhiyu is originally a regional speciality of Surat. The dish is a seasonal one, comprising of vegetables that are available on the South Gujarat coastline. Since Makar Sankranti is an ode to the harvest season, undhiyu is traditionally made using all the crops harvested around this time,” says chef Govind of Masala Mandi, Bengaluru.

Feast from the far East

Along with holy dips and special prayers, makara chaula made from freshly harvested rice is a speciality of Odisha during Sankranti. “This is a traditional recipe made using fragrant ground rice that is fresh from the first harvest. It is added along with milk, cottage cheese, sugarcane, jaggery, ginger, pepper and cut fruits. A small pinch of cinnamon is our secret ingredient,” says chef Rajani Kanta Raj of The Belgadia Palace located in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha.

The highlight was easily the session by organic, farmer SR Sundaraman initiated by the Coimbatore Vizha. “The onus to preserve diversity in grains lies entirely with you: the consumers,” he boomed. The more diverse we are in our food choices, the better it is for the farmers, our health and the environment. “It is our social responsibility to eat right, eat seasonal and eat what is locally available,” he said. Dismissing the myths and disinformation about organic farming, Sundararaman insisted organic was the only way forward.

Sreedevi Lakshmi Kutty (co-founder, Bio Basics, a social venture retailing organic food) is a strident consultant to the Save Our Rice Campaign, which works on conserving and promoting traditional rice varieties. She echoes Sundaraman as she emphasises the importance of diversity. “The more diversity there is the more protected we are. If one is wiped out, there are others to fall back on. Look what happened during the potato blight in Ireland. Each crop is different and its resilience varies. In the event of a pest attack, while one variety may be wiped out, there may be others that do not die out. Also each variety of rice or other grains offer us different levels of nutrients that we don’t even know about. Unfortunately we have made our diets so monochromatic,” she rues.

That is why this Pongal, Sreedevi says, it is important to remind ourself about our grain diversity. “It is our responsibility to introduce our children to this heritage and send them out into this world with memories of these different tastes. Just like we pass on heirlooms and traditions. Otherwise it will not be in their memory bank. Only we can ensure that these varieties of grains continue to grow in the fields. That is a promise we have to make to our farmers,” she says.

One way to do it is to innovate. “Why don’t you try and use black rice for pongal or a paaysam,” she suggests. The black Karuppu Kavani is grown right here in Tamil Nadu. It is rich in nutrients and the bran makes it appear black.

Shreeya Adka

European dishes with Indian rice The Indian chef community is catching up with the slow food movement, which began in Italy in 1986, says Chef Shreeya Adka of Coimbatore’s fine-dining restaurant The French Door. “We are moving towards using locally sourced ingredients and preserving regional produce, many of which are on the verge of extinction.

Shreeya’s tryst with indigenous rice started recently “when I started my trials for the new menu to be launched this year. I have always been curious about how European cuisine would fare when made with local produce.”

She experimented with “the fragrant Gandhasala for a risotto. However my favourite has been the Karupu Kavini, which not only gave a great al dente risotto but was also visually appealing due to its purplish black tinge. I must say I have started to like it more than the risotto made with Arborio rice grown in Italy.”

There is also a rare black-grained variety that was once cultivated only for Chinese royalty. It was called the Emperor’s rice and had amazing health benefits,” she says.

Sreedevi says the Karuppu Kavani is no less healthy. “Minerals, fibre for roughage are there in the bran and it is said to have anti-oxidants in plentiful. It is chewy and very good for paaysams. Soak it overnight, pressure cook it the following morning and then cook it with naatu sakkarai. It is delicious,” she promises.

Traditionally, says agrarian culture expert Pamayan, Pongal is thanksgiving for a bountiful harvest and culmination of the Samba season cultivation, the major cropping season in most of Tamil Nadu. It is when rice, millets, pulses and a lot of vegetables are harvested. The farmers get an income after a long growing season and look forward to a break of three months till the next season in April. It is a festival of new rice, new lentils and new vessels — puthu arisi, puthu payaru and puthu panai.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/82fdnm/article30523736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Karuppukavuni-Black-Rice,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/on-the-importance-of-traditional-rice-varieties/article30523740.ece
446,2020/01/09,A workshop by Arun Viswanathan introduces bean-to-bar chocolates,"The workshop was a revelation. Arun Viswanathan of Chitra’m Chocolates and Café Infusions, in tandem with Coimbatore Vizha, organised a three-hour session, to introduce bean-to-bar chocolates. Saying that this is one way of “celebrating cacao farmers and the hand-crafted chocolate makers,” he used the event to showcase hand-picked chocolates from round the world.

Arun’s awards 2019 the Moringa Lemon White Chocolate won the Bronze in Asia Pacific Region for white chocolate with infusions category

2018 the Mango Lassi Milk Chocolate won the Bronze in Asia Pacific region in Milk Chocolate with Infusions Category and the Bronze in the World Finals for Milk Chocolate with Infusions Category

2018 The 70% Dark Chocolate with Palm Sugar won Bronze in Asia Pacific Region in Dark Chocolate in Alternative Sugar category

The workshop was held on three days. “On the first day, just two people had signed up, the second saw more than 20 and the final day had seven.” The day began with history on the Mayan and Aztec civilisations, known to have been some of the earliest cacao cultivators. “They considered it as food of the gods, and used it to barter,” says Arun pointing to an entire wall in his café. Mayari from Mexico’s Kakaw Chocolates, who conducted a workshop at his café, painted information about chocolate. One learns that for 10 cacao beans one could get a rabbit; a single tomato could be had for a single bean and, a slave cost 100 beans!

The suspense built up as Meenakshi, a chocolatier at Infusions Cafe, places glasses of water and a saucer with a big biscuit. “Make sure you drink plenty of water, as chocolate dehydrates. The biscuit is a palate cleanser between each tasting,” she explains. We taste each chocolate and write down what it reminds us of: taste and flavour.

The bean-to-bar journey Bean-to-bar chocolates are a healthier alternative to mass-produced ones. They tend to have fewer ingredients and less sugar. They are also more supportive off cacao farmers. These hand-crafted chocolates allow for more creativity and experimentation. When the cacao beans are sourced locally or closer home, then it also makes a strong statement about sustainability.

“Take a single bite, allow the piece of chocolate to sit on your tongue, shut your eyes and ears to the world outside and experience it. Then write down what you taste on the form in front of you” instructs Arun. There is some trepidation. I have never allowed chocolate to sit in my mouth! But Arun is reassuring, “Tasting isn’t a easy job. It takes a lot of time and effort to develop our taste buds to be able to enjoy chocolates and its nuances attached.”

We detect mere suggestions of flavours. In order to help us, Arun hints, they could be spicy, earthy, fruity, mollasses-y or simply chocolaty. Or possibly a combination of two or three of the above. He also asks us to observe the appearance, the crisp snap as we break it, the smell, the melt and the after-taste.

“During my time in Belgium, I noticed a lot of tasting sessions happening and I never understood the purpose. What can be so different about tasting a chocolate except for the flavours infused? But all this changed when, while conducting a bean-to-bar chocolate-making workshop in Coimbatore, we had a short tasting and aroma analysis by Mayari.”

Each individual has a different response to chocolates; each one’s palate receives it differently. For example the Indian palate usually demands stronger, bolder infusions while, in the West, everything is toned down.

After the tasting, we discuss the flavours each one noted. We agree on some and disagree on others. Since we are doing it over chocolates, it is all very civilised.

We are given another piece of each of our favourites. Mine has a smoky, earthy flavour. What are Arun’s favourite and the most bizarre he has tasted? “I can’t have enough of truffles made with loads of butter in them and dark chocolate. The most outrageous flavour I tasted was fried onions in chocolate. I had them both in Belgium.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/kcb0nh/article30523403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chocolate,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/a-workshop-by-arun-viswanathan-of-chitram-chocolates-to-introduce-bean-to-bar-chocolates/article30523404.ece
447,2020/01/09,Tubers are the veggies of choice to celebrate Thiruvathira,"Ever had ‘Ettangaadi chuttu nivedyam’? This is a special preparation that celebrates tubers. Kachil (purple yam), chena (yam), koorka (Chinese potato), nanakizhangu (lesser yam), cheru kizhangu (lesser yam), cheruchembu (colocasia), valiyachembu (colocasia) and madura kizhangu (sweet potato) are steamed or roasted and then cooked in jaggery syrup and garnished with sliced or grated coconut. This is eaten by women on the day before Thiruvathira. In some temples, ettangaadi chuttu nivedyam is given as prasadam. The ingredients and the cooking method, however, varies from place to place.

On the day of Thiruvathira festival, a puzhukku made of tubers, raw banana, pumpkin and so on is cooked in many houses. It is made with grated coconut, jeera and other spices.

Observed mainly by women, Thiruvathira is believed to be the birth star of Lord Shiva. The Thiruvathira festival in the Malayalam month of Dhanu, which usually coincides with a full moon day, is celebrated with music, dance, and, of course, food.

“Legend has it that Lord Shiva came out of his deep meditation after Sati’s self-immolation and married goddess Parvati on this day. Women observe a day-long fast and perform various rituals. Tamilians celebrate this day as Ardra Darshanam and worship Shiva and go to the temple before sunrise. There is also a version that Thiruvathira festival is celebrated in memory of the revival of Kamadeva, the mythological God of love, after he disrupted Shiva’s meditation that resulted in him being burnt to death due to Shiva’s fury,” writes food blogger Manjusha Pisharody.

She continues: “My mother still fondly recalls the joyful Thiruvathira days during her teenage days. They used to wake up at 4 am. Women from other homes would come and they would go as a group, gathering other women along the way and singing songs in praise of Lord Shiva as they walked towards a pond, usually of a Shiva temple. They would carry clothes, a new set if it was available. Getting into the pond was not easy as the mercury would come down a little during December-January. While taking a dip, they would sing songs and rhythmically splash water (thudichu kuli). Towards the end, while still in the water, they would hold hands and form a circle. After a bath, they would wear their new clothes, visit the Shiva temple and eat a banana and chew betel leaves. They would sing songs and return home and take turns to sit on a swing in front of the house.”

Thiruvathira puzhukku

A special preparation is made of tubers and other vegetables during the Thiruvathira festival. The main ingredient is purple yam, which is harvested during winter .

Ingredients:

Purple Yam (kaachil) – 250 gm

Raw banana – 1

Pumpkin – 250 gm

Green gram – 1/2 cup

Cumin seeds – 1/2 tsp

Grated coconut - 1 cup

Turmeric powder – 1/4 tsp

Red chilly powder/green chillies – 1/2 tsp/4

Water – 1 glass

Coconut oil – 1 tbsp

Curry leaves – 2 stalks

Method:

Soak the green gram dal overnight and pressure-cook it. Keep aside. Cut the vegetables into cubes and put them in a cooking pot. Add some water (just enough to immerse half of the cut vegetables). Add turmeric powder and chilli powder. Close and stir occasionally.

Grind the grated coconut and cumin seeds to make a coarse paste. If you are using green chillies, add that along with the coconut and cumin seeds. When the vegetables turn tender and well-cooked, add the cooked green gram, ground coconut paste and salt. Mix well and cook for 2 minutes. Turn off the fire and add the coconut oil and fresh curry leaves. The dish should give out a pleasing aroma.

This dish is a self-sufficient meal in itself and there are many variations to it.

A sweet dish made of arrowroot powder, which is usually made from home-grown arrowroot plant.

It’s a lengthy and tedious process of pulling out the root, cleaning, chopping, grinding, adding water and distilling the powder. At the end, however, you end up with a little quantity of arrowroot powder.

Ingredients:

Koova (arrowroot powder) – 100 gm

Jaggery – 200 gm

Water – 3 glasses

Grated coconut – 1/2 cup

Cardamom powder – 1 tbsp

Method:

Melt the jaggery in water. Strain to remove impurities. Mix the arrowroot powder in some water and make a smooth and thin paste without lumps. Add this paste to the jaggery syrup and place the mixture on the stove. Stir continuously on low flame. The mixture starts thickening. Turn off the fire when the mixture becomes a fine paste. Add cardamom powder and grated coconut. Mix well. Ghee or cashew fried in ghee can be added. Cooked moong dal can also be added along with the arrowroot powder.

There are regional variations to both the recipes.

By Manjusha Pisharody

Some women fast on the day of Thiruvathira by abstaining from rice-based food and have only preparations made of wheat, millets, sweets and tubers. Manjusha adds that although puzhukku made of tubers and other vegetables is made in north Kerala as well, the Ettangaadi is more common in the south. A sweet dish made of arrowroot powder (koova) and jaggery is also a speciality of this festival.

Octogenarian Janaky Nair, a homemaker from Edappally, says that in Kochi and certain places in Kerala, women from the entire neighbourhood would get together to celebrate the festival. The women were supposed to chew 108 betel leaves and adorn themselves with Dashapushpam (10 kinds of herbs and plants with medicinal value). She recalls with a laugh how even girls got a chance to chew betel leaves on that day.

“All our relatives and neighbours would get together in my grandmother’s house and we would stay awake all through the night by singing songs, reciting shlokas and prayers and performing Thiruvathira dance. Age was no bar. Right from great-grandmothers to little girls, everyone would pitch in. The first Thiruvathira of a bride is called Poothiruvathira and is a special occasion for her. Mine was celebrated in the city as we had moved to the capital city by then. Sadly, with the break-up of the joint family and loss of ponds, the Thiruvathira celebrations have lost its sheen. Now, it is mainly the food that revives those memories,” she adds. Manjusha speaks about the observation of a custom called Pathira poochoodal (wearing flowers at midnight).

City-based Priya Kolassery points out that as tubers are available in plenty during the ‘winter months’ in Kerala, that might be a reason why the different kinds are highlighted. “As children, I remember, we had steamed tubers of different kinds, many of which were grown in our house, during the festival of Karthika in the Malayalam month of Vrischikam (November-December). With the city expanding every day, we have lost touch with our roots. So, this time, my friend Sreedevi Padmajam and I offered kits that had six-seven kinds of tubers with two chutneys and it was sold out,” says Priya.

However, the fact remains that many of the tubers that were once commonly consumed are missing from our diet, points out Lakshmi Arvind, Editor, Agriculture World. She says that in the past, these tubers were usually found in homesteads and was part of the diet. “Due to urbanisation and migration to cities, unfortunately, we have forgotten those tubers and some of them have been forgotten. Now tuber melas in different parts of the country are trying to give the edible roots that are rich in nutrition a pride of place in our plates. There is a two-day ‘Roots and Tuber Mela’, which begins on January 11 at Nanjaraja Bahadur Chitra, Mysuru, while another tuber mela at Joida in Uttara Kannada will have on display tubers grown by the Kunbi community. This is the season when tubers are harvested and the planting is from February to March, before the onset of monsoon,” she explains.

To remind city dwellers of the roots that sustain us, many green grocers stock a wide range of tubers.

448,2020/01/09,The Dar Es Salaam Resto in Thiruvananthapuram brings a whiff of flavours from Tanzania,"Totemic images of African life and culture peek at you from orange walls as you enter Dar Es Salaam that greets you with a ‘karibu’ (welcome) embellished before a large carving of map of Africa. Makonde carvings, deft artwork from the eponymous ethnic group, adorn the décor as ‘Mamma Mia music’ lilts in the background. But mistake not that we are in the famous, faraway Tanzanian metropolis. This Dar Es Salaam is located right in the heart of the city and whips up exotic flavours from Tanzania, admittedly with a desi twist.

The multi-cuisine joint Dar Es Salaam Resto at Sasthamangalam in the Kerala capital, which opened in November, gives you a whiff of Tanzanian cuisine, even as the eclectic menu has Chinese, North Indian and South Indian dishes, including 25 varieties of kebabs. “The name’s a homage to the place,” says owner Anilkumar Vasudevan. He made the Tanzanian city his home for over 25 years where he runs two outlets of his Indo-African diner, ‘Swaad’, which are currently managed by his brothers.

Anilkumar, who used to work with a Japanese camera manufacturing firm, says he first landed in Tanzania in 1993. But his “passion for cooking and good food” saw him open Swaad in 2000. The outlet kept a customer base of both ethnic Africans and the Indian community in mind. He says Dar Es Salaam Resto is still in the nascent phase and the Tanzanian dishes currently includes only a handful of items as he “wants to take his time” to settle down before expanding the menu. The spacious diner’s emblem, done in the colours of the Tanzanian flag, bears a picture of a giraffe, the national animal of the African nation.

“African cuisine generally incorporates dishes that are more raw and dry, something that may not be completely acceptable to the Malayali palate. Hence, these items have been made spicier. Also, I can only bring so much of original ingredients from Tanzania,” chuckles Anilkumar.

Mayayi (Swahili for egg) chips comes in two variants – plain and with kheema fillings of choice that includes chicken, beef or mutton and cheese. It is essentially a Tanzanian omelet with potato fries, deemed a brunch staple. Anilkumar calls its a “layman’s dish” in Africa. Mishkaki beef, on the other hand, is a meaty treat, charcoal-grilled and tasting akin to kebabs. He points out that neck portions that are more tender are chosen for the preparation. Another pick is chicken sekela (spelt shakela in the menu) that comes with onion-based kachumbari salad, super-spicy chachandu for dip, mayonnaise and French fries. “Originally, a very hot variety of chilli called pilipili mbuzi is used to prepare chachandu,” he explains.

Perhaps, the highlight is the customised ‘African thali’ that works as a repast of maize flour-based ugali, michicha (spinach/kale), kidney beans, fried anchovies and beef roast. Extend the exoticity to the beverages on offer are imported African coffee and tea powder to in stock. Anilkumar says he will soon introduce matoke, a popular Tanzanian dish made of raw bananas.

He moved three of his cooks, all Indians, who were working with him at Swaad to bring the flavours of Dar Es Salaam to his city outlet. “But I haven’t forgotten naadan,” he says, pointing to the fish curry meals, beef coconut fry, chicken ularthiyathu and varutharacha chicken curry on the menu.

449,2020/01/09,"Pune DIG, accused of molesting teen, suspended","The Maharashtra government on Thursday suspended Deputy Inspector General of Police Nishikant More, who was booked for allegedly harassing a 17-year-old girl last year.

Mr. More, who was posted as DIG (Motor Transport) with the Pune police, was booked on December 27 by the Taloja police in Navi Mumbai for allegedly molesting his family friend’s daughter. He has been absconding since then.

The incident is alleged to have occurred on June 5. The victim has been missing since January 8 after leaving behind a note declaring her intention to commit suicide.

Mr. More’s suspension was announced by State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Thursday. “The disciplinary action was taken against Mr. More based on a report about the matter submitted by the office of the Director General of Police (Maharashtra),” Mr. Deshmukh said.

Meanwhile, the Panvel sessions court rejected Mr. More’s anticipatory bail plea on Thursday. In his arguments, the public prosecutor Jaideep Thakkar said, “In 2004, Mr. More was found in a objectionable situation with a lady in his service vehicle when the vehicle met with an accident. The then commissioner A.N. Roy had set up an enquiry against him.”

In court on Thursday Mr. More’s lawyer Aniket Deshkar, argued that both families shared good relations. Mr. Deshkar submitted photographs to show the families celebrating birthdays together. Mr. Deshkar also claimed that even after the alleged incident of molestation, the families met and spent time together and there were photos and videos of same.

The Navi Mumbai police on its part submitted before the court that Mr. More was an influential person and could tamper and influence the evidence, hence custodial interrogation was needed. Besides, the victim continues to be missing since January 8 when she left home leaving a suicide note blaming Mr. More. “The girl is yet to be found and are still investigating,” deputy commissioner of police, zone II, Ashok Dudhe said.

Mr. More’s wife, who was present in court, told media, “It is a false case. It is basically a property dispute. We had given the victim’s father ₹20 lakh for investing in a farm house and he failed to return it. After continuously asking for the money, the victim’s father one day came to our house, insulted us, and also outraged my modesty following which we registered an FIR. The victim’s father is right now on bail which we will challenge in high court.”

Meanwhile, following an allegation by victim’s father that he was threatened by constable Dinkar Salve, who introduced himself as CM’s driver, a non cognizable offence against him has been registered with Panvel City police. Mumbai police sources have confirmed that Mr. Salve who is attached with the Motor Transport department, and was currently assigned as CM’s driver, was on leave on Tuesday when the alleged threat incident happened at the court premises. Mr. Salve has in the past worked as Mr. More’s driver as well when the later was assistant commissioner of police. A departmental enquiry has been initiated against Mr. Salve.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6p78mm/article30525909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pune-cop-accused-of-molestation-suspended/article30525911.ece
450,2020/01/09,"After 20 years on the run, fugitive gangster Ejaz Lakdawala arrested by Mumbai police","After spending over 20 years on the run, gangster Ejaz Lakdawala was arrested by the Crime Branch of the Mumbai Police in Patna on Wednesday. Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh lauded the police’s efforts at a press interaction in Mumbai.

Lakdawala, 50, who fled the country some time between 1998 and 1999, was wanted in a string of cases, including murder, attempt to murder and extortion, registered since 1989. Crime Branch officers said that so far, they had 25 cases registered against him, apart from 80 applications pending with various police stations and agencies. His daughter Shifa alias Soniya was arrested by the Anti Extortion Cell on December 28 last in a fake passport case, and has been in police custody.

“We stepped up our efforts to apprehend him in the past six months and received a lot of information, which we verified with multiple sources, including the Central intelligence agencies. The arrest of his daughter further increased the pace of our efforts, as we got a lot of information about him from her,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Santosh Rastogi said.

On Wednesday, the Anti Extortion Cell received information that Lakdawala would be in Panta and rushed a team there. “A team of the Mumbai police sought our assistance in arresting someone under the Jakkanpur police station last night [on Wednesday night] and the local police helped it arrest Ejaz Lakdawala… After his arrest, the Mumbai police completed the legal formalities, and Lakdawala was handed over to them,” Bihar Additional Director-General of Police (Law and Order) Amit Kumar told journalists in Patna.

However, sources in Bihar’s Police Department told The Hindu that Lakdawala was arrested at the Mithapur bus stand under the Jakkanpur police station in Patna, and he was planning to board a bus bound for Darbhanga-Madhubani.

The reason for his return to the country has evoked curiosity, with the police believing that he could have come down to help his daughter come out of jail.

Lakdawala grew up at Dongri in Mumbai. The influence of the erstwhile gangsters like Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar and his own violent tendencies pushed him into a life of crime. He was still a teenager when the Dongri police booked him for allegedly assaulting his teacher, a woman, with a compass. He spent several months in the juvenile remand home at Dongri before being released. He was subsequently recruited by Rajendra Nikalje alias Chhota Rajan as a footsoldier. Then, Rajan was with Dawood, working as an enforcer-cum-recruiter for the gang.

Crime Branch officers said the first murder case against him was registered in 1989 and the second in 1998.

“After Rajan broke with Dawood in 1993, Lakdwala stayed loyal to Rajan and started working for him. In 1998, he killed an accused wanted in the 1993 bomb blasts. To promote his image of being a “patriotic don”, Rajan had announced a vendetta against the perpetrators of the serial blasts and killed several of the people accused in the case. After the murder, Lakdawala fled the country and joined his boss in Malaysia,” a Crime Branch officer said.

In 2002, Lakdawala survived an attempt on his life, when Dawood’s henchmen shot at him in Bangkok. He sustained seven bullet injuries and was rumoured to have died for months before he resurfaced and resumed his place on the wanted list of law enforcement agencies.

Lakdawala parted ways with Rajan in 2008 and started working independently. Sources said the relations between him and Rajan began to sour after the attack on Rajan in Bangkok. After the attack, Rajan started suspecting all his henchmen of informing the Dawood gang of his movements. Several of his aides, including Ravi Pujari, broke with him. The tension, which started simmering between Rajan and Lakdawala in 2000, reached the boiling point in 2008, owing to issues over payment, officers said.

“Since then, according to our information, Lakdawala has travelled to Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Malaysia, Cambodia and Nepal, and is said to have property in Canada, Malaysia and London. Our information also indicates that he has had several aliases and travel documents...,” Mr. Rastogi said.

451,2020/01/09,Ambulances are a must at Bandra-Worli Sea Link: HC,"The Bombay High Court on Wednesday asked the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) to consider deploying ambulances on the Bandra-Worli Sea Link.

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla said several persons brazenly flout speed limits on the sea link, which may lead to accidents and hence the presence of ambulances was a must.

The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL), filed by NGO Association for Aiding Justice, regarding the lack of emergency medical services for accident victims on highways.

The petition highlighted the high number of deaths on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and other State and national highways, pointing out that there was an urgent need for well-equipped ambulances and trauma centres there.

The MSRDC on Wednesday told the court that it has now deployed ambulances at various points along the Mumbai-Pune Expressway.

The Bench then sought to know from MSRDC lawyer Vijay Patil if ambulances are also deployed in roads maintained by the corporation within the city limits including the sea link.

“The sea link witnesses several cars violating the speed limit. The cameras placed will impose a fine, but what if there was any accident? We do not have any empathy or mercy for such persons (who flout speed limits) but these persons kill others in accidents,” Justice Dharmadhikari said.

“It would be better if facilities like ambulances are made available. This may act as a deterrent too,” the court observed.

The Bench disposed of the petition after directing the MSRDC to consider its suggestion.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/npi0cj/article30520308.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BombayHighCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ambulances-are-a-must-at-sea-link-hc/article30520309.ece
452,2020/01/09,Four sports in one event: Racketlon to swing into city,"Racketlon is set to enter the Mumbai sports scene, specifically at the club level. The multi-sport event involves people taking part in table tennis, badminton, squash and tennis in that order before the winner is decided on overall points. Matches feature singles, doubles players engaging in 21 points-per-match-per-sport encounters. Outdoor fitness freaks take part in the triathlon (combination of long-distance swimming, cycling and running).

Gujarat hosted a racketlon competition last year, Rajasthan is slated to host an international event this year.

“It is a new sport being introduced in the city and we are looking to activate interest in Mumbai clubs. We are targeting members passionate about table tennis, badminton, squash or tennis, as each of these sports is popular in India. This is a new opportunity for those good at one or two disciplines and ready to try their hand at adapting to the others,” said Racketlon India Sports Federation (RISA) president, Kaushal Kumar Cheema.

Mr. Cheema, a former badminton international player, said there were various age categories for participants. “The idea is to challenge sports enthusiasts in clubs, at the same time create an opportunity for all-rounders to excel in a sport combining four disciplines. Every club member playing one of these four sports may or may not get to the top in his or her chosen sport,” he said.

The RISA chief was accompanied by president of Federation of International Rackletlon (FIR), Duncan Stahl, during the Mumbai clubs survey. The Englishman is an accomplished international player in the four-in-one sport. “Interest in racketlon will bring in more members into other sports. Clubs with facilities for squash or tennis will find enthusiasts ready to try out badminton or table tennis. The more you train in a sport new to you, the better you will get.”

Mr. Cheema and Mr. Stahl pointed to the fact that there was no dearth of talent in the city. Commander Ashutosh Pednekar from the Indian Navy, for instance, was a participant in 45-plus age group. The 48-year-old specialises in badminton, took part in the men’s doubles (partnering Kiran Makhode) and mixed doubles (with Naheed Divecha as partner) competition at the World Seniors Badminton Championships last year, organised by the Badminton World Federation in Katowice, Poland.

Mumbai-based Mr. Pednekar has also represented India in racketlon. He was a member of the Indian team, which won the Challenge shield last year, beating Austria in the final at the 17th World Racketlon Championships in Leipzig, Germany. Udaipur will host the country’s first international event, India Open Racketlon Challenger, from January 11 to 13. Matches will be held for 21 points in each of four sports. The event has attracted 57 entries from India and abroad.

Racketlon rules stipulate that a match starts with table tennis. Badminton and squash are second and third in the sequence, while the match ends with tennis. Mr. Stahl revealed that the rationale was to move from smaller racquets to bigger ones, and Mr. Pednekar said moving from lighter racquets (table tennis) to heavier ones (tennis) is easier on the hand.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/44l2ha/article30518547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09bmRacketlon1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/four-sports-in-one-event-rackleton-to-swing-into-city/article30518548.ece
453,2020/01/09,"Over 55,000 to participate in Tata Mumbai Marathon","A total of 55,322 people will be at the start line of the 17th Tata Mumbai Marathon on January 19, exhibiting a 19% increase in total participation and 35% increase in women participants.

Event management firm Procam International, at a press conference on Wednesday, said 9,660 runners were participating in the full marathon, while 15,260 runners had enrolled for the half-marathon. The dream run (6.6 km) has 19,707 runners registered, while 8,032 runners will take part in the 10-km run, 1,022 in the senior citizen run and 1,596 in champions with disabilities.

The defending champions of 2019 Cosmas Lagat (Kenya) and Worknesh Alemu (Ethiopia) will return to take part in the marathon. Olympian and Arjuna Awardee Sudha Singh and Indian Army’s Srinu Bugatha will be running too. While actor Tiger Shroff is the face of the marathon, Olympic gymnast Shannon Miller will be the the event ambassador.

Vivek B. Singh, joint MD, Procam International, said, “To see India, embrace running is a dream come true for us. To participate in full marathon is not easy, these people have been practising for the last six months.”

The marathon has launched a new concept called ‘virtual marathon’ wherein one can run from any location at ones own pace and time. E-certificate will be provided to such runners. This comes as a result of higher demands, stricter cut-offs and a lack of space, which leads to thousands of applications being held back each year.

The event firm has teamed up with a mobile learning application, ASICS Runkeeper, to announce the ‘Run as One’ initiative. “It can be used by anyone who has a flair for running and can be used by them whether they are in Thane, Powai, Surat or for that matter anywhere in the continent. However, we are focusing on India in the first year,” Ashish Bhushan, director, Procam International, said.

Participants can take part in the virtual marathon by logging on to the marathon’s official website and registering with a fee of ₹99. They can then install the ASICS Runkeeper app and select the Tata Mumbai Marathon run challenge, which will activate on January 19. There are three categories the participants can contest under — 42-km full marathon, the half-marathon or the 10-km run. The participants will get a digital bib and the winner will be awarded with separate virtual trophy and certificates. There are no cash prizes in this category.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gqup43/article30518497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09bmPress-Conference,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/over-55000-to-participate-in-tata-mumbai-marathon/article30518498.ece
454,2020/01/09,Ruckus over BMC engineers’ recruitment,"A ruckus erupted in Wednesday’s standing committee meeting over the recruitment of junior engineers. The Shiv Sena took the help of its former ally Bharatiya Janata Party and allowed the proposal to be passed, making it clear there is no Maha Vikas Aghadi, the mixed-bag coalition that rules the State, in the municipal corporation.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had begun the recruitment process for the position of 341 junior engineers last year. The administration had called for applications to hold an entrance exam while the model code of conduct was in force in the State in view of Assembly elections. When this information was brought to light, standing committee members opposed the proposal since several civic staffers who wanted to apply for the job could not as they were on election duty. Standing committee members from the Sena, Congress, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Samajwadi Party had directed the civic administration not to hold the exam. They had also called it an insult to the committee as it was not consulted on conducting the exams. The BMC received 36,218 applications for 341 posts and the process of holding the exam cost the administration ₹1.5 crore.

Even after the MVA had been formed in the State, there was no announcement of an alliance at the municipal corporation level. With a majority in the BMC, the Sena continues to be the single largest party. In the recently-concluded zilla parishad elections too, the MVA constituents had not fought as an alliance.

However, when the same proposal came before Wednesday’s standing committee meeting, the Shiv Sena allowed it to be passed despite opposition from the Congress and NCP. The Opposition claimed they were not even allowed to speak, and walked out. “We were not even allowed to record our remarks and instructions. The chairman has done this once, and might do this again. We will stage a walkout again if that happens,” said leader of the opposition Ravi Raja.

Chairman Yashwant Jadhav said, “Since the BMC has already spent ₹1.5 crore on the process, we felt public money should not be wasted. That is why we allowed it to be passed. If the Opposition is unhappy, we will speak to them.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ruckus-over-bmc-engineers-recruitment/article30518473.ece
455,2020/01/09,Iran-Iraq tension: Air Traffic Control prepares for rerouting of flights,"Mumbai’s Air Traffic Management (ATM) system on Wednesday began to gear up for rerouting aircraft following the escalation of tensions in the Iraq-Iran region, which has led to airlines opting for alternate flight paths.

Mumbai’s Air Traffic Control (ATC), which also looks after oceanic and upper airspace flight movements, said as of Wednesday afternoon, it had a request from Emirates for rerouting. In anticipation of an increase in requests, the ATC decided to add one sector each to the oceanic and upper airspace routes, where aircraft overfly India, under Mumbai ATC’s jurisdiction.

“There could be a 60% to 70% increase in air traffic. We are mentally prepared and have rostered duties accordingly. Revised routings are something individual airlines have to take a call on. It will either have to be to the north or south of the affected region,” said a senior Airports Authority of India official, who is co-ordinating with the affected airlines.

The Mumbai ATC handles airline traffic in sectors surrounding Mumbai. These include four sectors each in the upper airspace and oceanic airspace along with two sectors in terminal airspace (for take-offs and landings in Mumbai).

U.S. advisory

Air India and Air India Express announced changes to their flight paths along with airlines like KLM, Singapore International Airlines (SIA) and Virgin Atlantic. While U.S. FAA’s advisory also mentions staying off the Gulf of Oman, Indian carriers said they continued to operate a normal schedule on the Gulf routes.

“All SIA flights to and from Europe have not flown over Iranian airspace and have been taking different flight paths since January 6. The new routes do not significantly change flight times. We are closely monitoring the situation in the region and will take appropriate precautions if necessary,” an airline spokesperson said.

IndiGo said it does not operate any flights over Iranian and Iraqi airspace, and hence does not expect its flights to the Gulf region or Turkey to be impacted. “The routes to Gulf operate through Oman, Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf, while the routes to Turkey fly over the northern routes over the Caspian Sea and head directly from there to Istanbul. Currently, our flights are operating as per schedule,” the Indigo spokesperson said. The airline was monitoring the situation closely and in case of a contingency, there could be slight time changes in flight operations, which would be proactively communicated to passengers through regular channels, the spokesperson said.

‘Longer flights’

Virgin Atlantic, which operates to London, said flight times to and from Mumbai may be slightly longer than expected. “Safety and security is our No. 1 priority and we always follow the strict advice set out by UK and international authorities. We are closely monitoring developments in the Iranian and Iraqi air space, which has resulted in a slight change to our flight routing,” a spokesperson said.

Air India (AI) spokesperson, Dhananjay Kumar, said in the light of tensions in the Iranian airspace, a decision to temporarily reroute flights of AI and Air India Express overflying Iran had been taken. “This may lead to increase in flying time by approximately 20 minutes for flights from Delhi and 30 to 40 minutes for flights from Mumbai. The situation is being closely monitored,” Mr. Kumar said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/c02unc/article30518471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BMAIRINDIA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/iran-iraq-tension-air-traffic-control-prepares-for-rerouting-of-flights/article30518472.ece
456,2020/01/09,"‘Will take legal action against Tanushree Dutta, her lawyer’","A day after actor Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar’s lawyer, Nilesh Pawaskar, of fraudulently taking crucial documents from her and affecting police investigation, the latter has denied the allegations and said he will be taking legal action against Ms. Dutta and her lawyer Nitin Satpute.

The documents, according to Ms. Dutta, pertain to Bollywood’s first case in the #MeToo movement of October 2018, where she accused Mr. Patekar of sexually harassing her on the sets of the movie Horn Ok Pleassss. She had also accused director Rakesh Sarang, producer Samee Siddiqui and choreographer Ganesh Acharya of being involved in the act.

Ms. Dutta had filed a complaint regarding the same with the Oshiwara police, who after investigation, filed a B-summary report last year, seeking closure of the case as they did not find any evidence against Mr. Patekar to file a charge sheet.

The actor on Tuesday announced that she has filed a protest petition against the B-summary which is scheduled to be heard on January 17. “In December, Mr. Pawaskar came to my residence and told me that Mr. Patekar would get me jailed and he wanted to help me with the case. He also asked for original documents, including the contract of the item song in the movie, which according to him were necessary to send a notice to the producer. It was only after he took away the documents that I came to know that he was Mr. Patekar’s lawyer,” Ms. Dutta said in a press conference on Tuesday.

The actor also said the contract was an important document to be presented in court as it mentioned that the item song was to be a solo artist song and the dance steps and costume would be according to her comfort.

Ms. Dutta’s lawyer too has alleged that he faced harassment from Mr. Pawaskar due to which he was removed from the lawyers’ WhatsApp group. “He also asked the other group members to file complaints against me. I will take action against him for cheating my client and defaming me,” Mr. Satpute said.

However, when The Hindu reached out to Mr. Pawaskar, he said he had appeared for Mr. Patekar in one a case in 2005. He also said he never approached Ms. Dutta and all the allegations made against him by her were false and baseless. Mr. Pawaskar said he intended to initiate legal action against the actor and Mr. Satpute for falsely accusing him.

“Ms. Dutta came to me in 2008 to file a case after a cheque given to her by a producer bounced. Accordingly, I issued a notice to the producer. But when she started talking about Mr. Patekar, I told her that I am only concerned about the case at hand and refused to talk about Mr. Patekar, as he was my client and friend,” Mr. Pawaskar said. He also said he never met the actor again and that she did not even pursue the case of the cheque any further.

“I never asked her for any documents or contracts. Even in order to file the notice for dishonoured cheque, I do not need any documents unless they were to be presented at the court hearing. A lawyer will only ask for the story to issue a notice, not documents,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/naz1po/article30518419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BMTANUSHREE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/will-take-legal-action-against-tanushree-dutta-her-lawyer/article30518420.ece
457,2020/01/09,‘Solidarity and exchange of ideas is most important’,"A one-of-a-kind conference that aims to share stories of women from around the world, who have excelled in the field of architecture, construction and other related design fields was inaugurated here on Wednesday. The inaugural day of the three-day Women In Design 2020+ International Conference, organised by the HECAR Foundation, was dominated by talk of solidarity and collaboration.

The speakers on the first day were world renowned architects, Brinda Somaya, Neera Adarkar, Salma Damluji, Joana Dabaj, Abha Narain Lambah, Elizabeth Vines, and Billie Tsien.

The conference showcases talents of women architects, while giving them an opportunity to innovate on new idea in collaboration with design professionals from across the world. “This will help us come up with unique designs as they would be a fusion of different cultures,” said conservation architect Abha Narain Lambah.

In her keynote address, Ms. Tsien, the founding partner of the award-winning firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects-TWB, emphasised upon the importance of exchanging ideas for being a successful architect. “The feeling of solidarity and exchanging of ideas are key to success for highly-skilled women professionals,” said Ms. Tsien, who is currently working on the Obama Presidential Centre in Chicago.

Ms. Tsien highlighted the importance of building spaces for families in order to keep growing as an architect.

“There are some issues when it comes to women taking architecture as their profession. No one has come up with child care being mandated across federally [in the US]. It is an issue which governments need to look at across the globe,” said Ms. Tsien while stressing the fact that the number of women studying architecture, is more than that of men yet the workspace remains dominated by men. She went on to state, that architects needed to have the courage and desire to come up with infrastructure which would represent a society’s culture. “The cliche of the husband and wife working side by side at the computer screen has now been mostly supplanted. How does this help a woman striving to make it on her own?,” asked Ms. Tsien.

Urban conservationist and founder of HECAR Foundation, Brinda Somaya, said not much has changed in the past few decades for women architects.

“We often talk about the role of women in the future of architecture. But, what are the new ideas which have emerged for women architects in the past years? The question definitely needs to be addressed,” Ms. Somaya said. Ms. Somaya emphasised the need to collaborate, an idea that would help the world in developing unique design projects. “There is no place for an individualistic practise in the architectural profession,” said Ms. Somaya.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/avvh6k/article30518410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09bmBrinda-Somaya-Nandini-Somaya-Sampat,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/solidarity-and-exchange-of-ideas-is-most-important/article30518411.ece
458,2020/01/09,"Mumbai stays peaceful, unaffected by Bharat bandh","Barring banking services, normal life in Mumbai was not hit by the day-long nationwide strike called by Joint Action Committee comprising 10 major trade unions against the Centre’s ‘anti-people’ policies on Wednesday.

While some shops downed shutters in Sena-controlled areas like Dadar and Worli early in the day, most opened their stores as the day progressed. BEST and local train services functioned as did operations at the Mumbai airport and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trusts.

A protest in Malad saw a gathering of local businessmen even as most of the businessmen kept their shops open in the area. Protesters gathered near a Hanuman temple in Malad (West) to protest against the economic crisis and the change proposed in the labour laws by the government. The protesters discussed how the government has been privatising industries resulting in losses to the common man. They also raised slogans against the Prime Minister and recited the poem ‘Hum Dekhenge’ penned by Faiz Ahmed Faiz.

Mumtaz Ali Sheikh, proprietor of a screw manufacturing unit, said that due to recession in the market, he had to sack his employees as both the manufacturing contracts and income received were low. “Earlier I had 13 employees working in two shifts each, but now I can only afford three to four labourers that too after in just a single shift. Moreover, the product sells at the same price as it used to six years ago,” he said.

Mr. Sheikh explained that the bigger players were capable of selling their products online due to large scale manufacturing. “Many of them also import products from China, which are a lot cheaper than our products. The government needs to focus on more exports of Indian goods and less on import,” he said.

Prabhakar Narkar, Mumbai president, JD (S), said the youth is suffering from problems like unemployment and job loss but the BJP government was busy with other unimportant issues.

“Businessmen and small-scale industry owners hope that their sales will be better during the festival season, but in vain. Business is down by an average 40%. To help people in this bad time, government needs to keep a constant flow of money in the market and once the flow of money starts, market will slowly return to normal,” said Charul Joshi, secretary, Communist Party of India’s Mumbai unit.

Sea of women

At Dadar’s Kotwal Garden, a sea of women, all members of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC), gathered as a mark of protest.

The protest, a part of the nation-wide agitation against government’s ‘anti-labour’ policies, was organised by working women from different parts of the city, who were dressed in colour-coordinated red outfits — representing the colour of AITUC’s flag.

The women also wore badges saying AITUC would complete 100 years this October, as it was started in 1920 in Mumbai.

The protest began with sloganeering which highlighted failures of the ruling regime and also saw protesters demand their right to receive pension, monthly ration and reduction in the prices of daily commodities, which has left the lower-middle class with no purchasing power.

Babli Rahwat, general secretary of AITUC Maharashtra, said that the Maharashtra Rajya Domestic Worker Welfare Board had stopped functioning after 2014. “After 2014, the Board has been completely inactive and they have removed both the representatives of the working class and owners. It has stopped giving ₹10,000 to lower-middle class women, employed as domestic help, after they turn 60. There are some women who do not even have money to consult a doctor. We also urge the government to bring out a policy which will provide these women with free health check-up and medication,” she said.

Comrade Prakash Reddy, general secretary of CPI’s Mumbai unit said, “This happened because the government is only supporting big corporations and is not bothered about the social security of workers. They are privatising the companies and the aim of these private firms is to earn maximum profits therefore they are denying bonus, cutting down on pension of the old workers and are exploiting the labour class. These private firms have also started using ‘hire and fire’ system where there are no permanent workers, and all of them work under contract system which leaves them unemployed after a certain period of time.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/w00bk0/article30518368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BMBANDH1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-stays-peaceful-unaffected-by-bharat-bandh/article30518370.ece
459,2020/01/09,Police oppose DIG’s anticipatory bail plea,"The Taloja police on Wednesday opposed the anticipatory bail application of Nishikant More, Deputy Inspector General (Motor Transport), Pune, saying it would be dangerous to grant his plea as Mr. More was untraceable. “With the victim also going missing since Monday night, and the alleged accused being untraceable, it is risky to grant anticipatory bail to him. Hence we said in court that we were opposed to this. The court however has given a further date of Thursday,” said senior inspector Kashinath Chavan.

Meanwhile, even a day after she went missing after leaving behind a “suicide” note, the 17-year-old victim who had accused Mr. More of molestation, is yet to be found. “Even as the girl is still missing, we believe she would be safe. She had left a note saying she plans to commit suicide but in the CCTV footage, she is seen jumping over the society gate with a bag. Any person intending to commit suicide would not take a huge bag with her. Moreover, her friend who works with her family’s business, has also been missing from the same time. The phone of the Kharghar-based friend, in his early 20s, was switched off around 1 a.m. on Tuesday while the girl’s phone was switched off around 11.55 p.m. on Monday,” a police officer said. The family of the friend has registered a missing person complaint with the police.

After leaving home around 11.30 p.m., the girl had WhatsApped images of her “suicide” letter to her father before switching off the phone. The letters were also found in her notebook in her bedroom. Since there was a society meeting going on near the main gate of the society where she resided in Taloja, she jumped over another gate and left on Monday night.

Meanwhile, the family has alleged that a man who introduced himself as the CM’s driver met the father of the victim in court on Wednesday and threatened him. “We do not know if he really was CM’s driver. He told my father we should think properly before giving a statement in court or else we would face consequences,” the girl’s brother said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/j9lm4x/article30518351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BM-Nishikant,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/police-oppose-digs-anticipatory-bail-plea/article30518352.ece
460,2020/01/09,Thousands turn up for Bahujan Kranti Morcha at Alibaug,"Thousands from across Raigad district turned up for the Bahujan Kranti Morcha organised by the All India Backward (SC, ST, and OBC) and Minority Communities Employees Federation at Alibaug on Wednesday. The rally was in protest against NRC and CAA. The first phase of the morcha was on December 20, last year, while the final phase will be on January 29, when a Bharat bandh has been called.

Prabhakar Mokashi, district coordinator of the morcha for Raigad district, said protests and rallies were conducted across 550 districts in the country and a letter was submitted to the respective district administration. The rally was backed by all non-political organisations, Mr. Mokashi said. “Members of the Muslim community, SC, ST, and Buddhists participated with large numbers.”

Imtiyaz Palkar, peace and rehabilitation chairman of Raigad District Muslim Welfare Organisation that supported the morcha, said, “The rally started at Ambedkar statue and passed via Shivaji statue before ending at KES School. A 10-member delegation submitted a letter to the Raigad Collector.”

The letter had 12 demands, including issues pertaining to NRC, CAA, EVM, and VVPAT. The letter also demanded that cases be registered against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. “They have divided the country and created disharmony. Hence criminal cases should be filed against them and fast-tracked,” Mr. Mokashi said. A demand to not associate religion with citizenship was also mentioned in the letter.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mjwiq3/article30518334.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09bmalibaug,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/thousands-turn-up-for-bahujan-kranti-morcha-at-alibaug/article30518335.ece

The Mumbai Police on Tuesday registered four FIRs in connection with the protests held in the city over the attack on students and faculty members at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Sources said all the FIRs were registered on a suo motu basis with the police as complainants.

What began as an impromptu assembly of people at Gateway on Sunday night soon grew into an overnight vigil with hundreds joining it on Monday. On Tuesday morning, the Mumbai Police moved the protesters to Azad Maidan and registered the FIRs.

“We met the Home Minister and urged him to take back the FIR. We highlighted that ours was a peaceful protest and nobody was disturbed by it.

463,2020/01/09,"Mirissa, on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, has everything for a lazy beach vacation","Arrive

At Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport, a car awaits to drive us to our seaside destination. Now, depending on the kind of traveller you are, there are other ways of doing this. The train route takes you along the coastline and is said to offer stunning views, provided you reach early enough in the morning to avoid the breakneck, Mumbai local-like crowds. And don’t mind disembarking at Weligama, about seven kilometres away, then taking a tuktuk the rest of the way. The car we hired, however, takes the smooth Southern Expressway that stays inland for the most part, passing fields, coffee estates and little hamlets: two-and-a-half hours of greenery that end at a little budget hotel by the sea.

Lots to see Lighthouse in Mirissa on the background of sunset, Sri Lanka

Day 1

5 am

The day is dedicated to catching a glimpse of the world’s largest mammal, in the ocean waters that serve as its feeding ground, way off the coast of Sri Lanka. We wake up at 5 am, for we have to report at the whale watchers’ office at Mirissa Harbour around 6 am. It is barely 15 minutes away, but hey, waking up takes time.

6 am

Before we know it, we are on our way in a little tuktuk driven by a surprisingly chirpy man. At the office, we are greeted by other men, also far more active and awake than we are. Mirissa is something of a hub for whale watching, and all the action begins early. The plus side of this is that tourists have a number of options to choose from; the minus side is that the sheer, haphazard rush of large ferries every morning tends to stress the mammal out.

The concerns are many, we are told by the family that runs Raja & The Whales, a local business with tie-ups with conservation agencies. Ethical tour operators are those who start off by listing the dos and don’ts — they inform you about the minimum distance that they always maintain, and tell you that, between closing in to get a good look and staying way to glimpse just the fin (maybe the tip of a tail and a burst of water), they will always choose the latter option.

After all that, they let you know that the feeding waters are a good two-and-a half hours journey into choppy ocean waters. If you think you are fit enough to avoid seasickness, think again.

Don’t get me wrong: the view of the receding coastline is beautiful, and the spray of ocean water on a leaping ferry is as exciting as few things can be. On a good day, you get to see as many as eight majestic blue whales — like I did. On a bad day, well, at least you get half your money back.

By the time we reach land again, it is nearly 1 pm. We are euphoric but exhausted. Having donated most of the contents of my stomach to the ocean, I can barely stay up, and long for some dry clothes and a warm bed. I will be sleeping till lunch, and lunch will be very, very late.

2 pm

Lunch, as it turns out, involves popping down to one of the many ‘roti huts’ down the lane, scarfing down a kothu parotta and a hearty, meat-stuffed parotta, and going back to the hotel to catch up on more sleep.

7 pm

Matara Road runs parallel to a stretch of Mirissa beach, and is flanked by hotels, backpacker hostels, souvenir shops and restaurants. Little lanes and unpaved shortcuts run through these like veins, connecting the road directly to the beach itself. We are too lazy to explore, so we walk up to an open restaurant under coconut trees, walk right through, and emerge on the other side to see plastic chairs steadied on sand, facing the ocean.

Restaurants like these line the little bay, docked by a little hill at each end. All of them have tables facing the water, and their catch for the day displayed proudly up front. The idea is for us to choose our fish, and choose our drink, and thus choose our restaurant. Since we have a hankering for whisky, we choose the lone shack serving it that evening (besides showing off some beautiful red snappers), and set up camp.

Day 2

8 am

Our destination for today is Koggala air force base. At this hour, it is a little over half-an-hour away. Traffic comprises mainly school buses and our lone tuktuk, buzzing along merrily on a road that runs along the seaside. We pass surf schools lining Weligama beach, fishing poles and boats on Midigama beach, and a little jetty with livelihood-assuring, sturdy fishing vessels tied tight.

At the air base, a private airline called F-air is waiting to fly us up on its four-seater plane, to try and spot whales from the sky. It is an hour-long affair from end to end, beginning with briefings by a marine biologist. After we are assured that the plane would not be disturbing whale behaviour in any way, we take off: first flying along the coast, gazing at beaches, palm groves and coral reefs below. Eventually, we turn towards the open ocean, coordinating with whale tracking ferries and keeping our eyes peeled for the tell-tale burst of water. Whales evade us, but a number of dolphins skip in and out of the rippling water, till eventually it is time to head back.

11 am

The morning still stretches out before us, but it is too harshly sunny to stroll and shop. Or even to head to the beach. So we decide to try out something we have read a lot about: Sri Lanka’s “authentic” Chinese cuisine. A sizeable Chinese immigrant population has ensured that the cuisine is commonly available in the country’s tourist town — we walk into The Blue Whale, and are cheerily informed that though they do not serve alcohol, BYOBs are welcome. So we sit down with two beer cans and order seafood, noodles and rice. The first two come in massive tureens fit to serve a party of four to the full; the latter in a little vessel scarcely larger than a dessert bowl. It looks clear, light and mild, but the chillies are surprisingly palpable.

6 pm

464,2020/01/09,Govt. planning to move court on free rice and SEC issues: CM,"The government is planning to move court on the issue of distribution of free rice and appointment of State Election Commissioner, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said here on Wednesday.

Speaking at a function to mark the inaugural of a library building at Poornankuppam, the Chief Minister said he himself will approach the court to uphold the right of an elected government to distribute free rice instead of transferring money to the beneficiaries account.

Similarly, the Minister for Public Works A. Namassivayam, who also holds the Local Administration portfolio, will challenge Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi’s decision to overrule the cabinet decision to appoint former bureaucrat T. M. Balakrishnan as the State Election Commissioner, the Chief Minister said.

The Chief Minister said there was no other way other than to approach the judiciary as the day-to-day interference of the Lt. Governor had become a hindrance to the functioning of the government, he said.

The government would emerge “victorious” in its legal and political battle against Ms. Bedi and the Centre, the Chief Minister said.

In a lighter vein, the Chief Minister said: “I am certain that Congress will return to power after the next Assembly elections, thanks to Ms. Bedi. People are aware of the difficulties faced by the government due to her style of functioning,” he said.

The victory in the three by-elections and huge margin received by the Congress candidate in last Lok Sabha polls indicate the support for the party, he said. “No other Lt. Governor or Governor is as obstructionist as Ms. Bedi,” the Chief Minister said.

The STF, along with personnel from the Orleanpet station, intercepted Deva and arrested him.

He was in possession of 600 grams of ganja in small packets at the time of his arrest. Later, the police recovered 1.5 kg of ganja from his house, the SSP said.

467,2020/01/09,Newly carved Kallakurichi district beset with problems,"With the creation of Kallakurichi district, the wheels of governance have been set in motion marking the beginning of a new chapter in the lives of people, particularly the large Malayali tribal population in Kalvarayan hills, a separate taluk in the predominantly agricultural district.

However, the need of the hour is catching up with the infrastructure-related challenges to meet the demand of its reputation as a new district.

Officials admit that the district suffers from serious traffic congestion and infrastructure related issues including road expansion, underground sewerage system and proper solid waste management.

The Collectorate complex has been temporarily accommodated at the Agricultural Marketing Committee office. The departments of Revenue, District Supply Office, Treasury, Adi Dravidar Welfare and Backward Classes Welfare have gone on stream while several district-level offices are yet to become operational for want of space.

Official sources said that since the existing staff were divided between the two districts, several departments are yet to come up. Heads of few line departments have been shuttling between the two districts for want of creation of separate posts.

The creation of the district panchayat and demarcation of boundaries for 412 panchayats in the district is under way. The new district panchayat will be created as per the guidelines and a public hearing is scheduled to be held in Villupuram on January 11 for demarcation of boundaries.

All along Kallakurichi was a separate revenue division in the composite Villupuram district. But now it has to maintain pace with the demand with an eye on development. The district authorities have drawn up a road map for implementation of key infrastructure programmes in Kallakurichi, which has nine blocks under its purview.

“I will give priority to implementing the government’s schemes and ensuring that grievances of people are paid attention to. Our focus would be on meeting the expectations of the people and the residents of Kallakurichi would be saved of their time to access the Collectorate,” said District Collector Kiran Gurrala.

Basic healthcare and infrastructure will be strengthened in Kalvarayan hills. The administration will strive to ensure that the tribals of Kalvarayan hills are relieved of their present agony of getting health care services and also their education requirements. The new district will successfully overcome all the challenges, Mr. Gurrala said.

Each line department will create its own district-level heads. The process is under way while review of welfare schemes and their implementation has started. The temporary Collectorate building will start functioning full-fledged from February, he said.

Official sources said the administration had also identified land at a few locations for the new Collectorate master plan complex. The type-design of the complex has also been sent to the government for approval.

The complex will include all district-level offices, residential quarters for officials and a state-of-the-art sports stadium.

469,2020/01/09,NHP: State improves ranking,"Kerala has improved its ranking in the National Hydrology Project (NHP) by bagging the eighth spot at the national level in the surface water category.

The results of the NHP mid-term review were declared in New Delhi on Tuesday. The State had stood 13th in the previous assessment, according to the State Water Resources Department. The rankings are based on criteria such as assessment of annual rainfall and water flow in rivers, real-time data collection, conduct of training programmes and data digitisation. Kerala scored 49.3 points out of 100 to secure the eighth position.

On the other hand, in the groundwater category, Kerala has been relegated to the 24th position, which fell in the ‘unsatisfactory’ list in the NHP rankings.

The mid-term review ranked surface water and groundwater agencies in the States, UTs and river basin organisations (RBO).

Gujarat and the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) bagged the first and second spots in the surface water category. Rajasthan stood third.

Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty, in a Facebook message, attributed the improvement in the State’s position to the systematic work of the Irrigation Design and Research Board (IDRB) under the Irrigation Department.

In all, 44 agencies including the States and Union Territories are involved in the World Bank-assisted NHP.

Kerala has been allocated ₹42 crore for NHP-related works.

The NHP gains in relevance for Kerala against the backdrop of the 2018 and 2019 floods. It will enable the State to design and develop projects for the protection of water resources and their sustainable utilisation, the Minister said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/wf4hdw/article30520512.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILEPICHYDROLOGY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/nhp-state-improves-ranking/article30517791.ece
470,2020/01/09,65 stray pups find home,"The Kudumbashree district mission has helped find homes for 65 pups its volunteers picked up from streets this financial year under the Animal Birth Control programme.

Kudumbashree has seven Animal Birth Control (ABC) units in the district. The units catch lactating female dogs only after three months of them giving birth and on such instances, they pick up the pups too, instead of leaving them behind.

The units then note down the details of the pups, vaccinate them and put them up for adoption. When those interested in owning a dog turn up, their details too are jotted down and the pups are handed over.

Adoption of puppies not only gives them a home but also helps in saving the money that the government earmarks for ABC. An amount of ₹2,100 is set aside for a stray dog under the ABC. As the pups do not grow up to be strays, the government can save this money.

It also provides a cost-effective long-term solution to issues such as possibility of rabies, attack on human beings, and general dog menace since the pups do not remain on the streets, say Kudumbashree district mission officials.

Sixty-five pups, 40 of them in the city Corporation limits alone, have been adopted till January 7 this fiscal.

Earlier, the Kudumbashree, in association with the People for Animals, had placed eight pups with families. However, the recent initiative has been more successful as people are aware that they can get pups from the ABC centres, the Kudumbashree officials say.

In rural areas

In the future, the district mission hopes to increase awareness of the initiative in rural areas so that puppy adoption picks up in the ABC centres there as well. The objective, they say, is to ensure that no puppy that reaches a veterinary hospital where ABC is performed (one in each block) is returned to the streets and instead finds a family to live with.

As many as 3,150 dogs have been sterilised by the seven ABC units in the district this financial year.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/c3g89t/article30520525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILEDOGADOPTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/65-stray-pups-find-home/article30517789.ece
471,2020/01/09,Lapses in job tax collection,"The audit report of the city Corporation for the financial year 2017-18 has pointed out lapses in the collection of professional taxes. According to the report, the details of the commercial establishments in each of the wards are not maintained properly in the demand registers. There has been a shortfall of ₹1.11 crore in professional taxes from traders in the financial year, as per the report.

It was found that demand registers for professional tax was not maintained properly both in the main office as well as in the zonal offices. The list of institutions in each ward was found to be incomplete, while some institutions which are not on the list were found to have remitted their taxes.

In the Attipra zonal office, for instance, there was no information on the amount various institutions in the ward owed as professional tax. Demand notices were not issued to several institutions in the ward.

In the Beemapally ward, banks, other financial institutions, petrol pumps and paramedical institutions were found missing from the professional tax demand register. The number of shops indicated in the register was also estimated to be much less than the actual.

The shortage of bill collectors has been cited as an explanation when the audit team sought the same from the section concerned.

Property tax dues

The audit report says that the Corporation was able to collect only 19.4% of the actual demand of ₹72.4 crore in property tax in the 2017-18 financial year.

However, the report also says that the entire collected amount might not be reflected as the digitisation process was ongoing at that time.

Many of the government and semi-government institutions, private banks and clubs have property taxes of several lakhs pending for the past decade and more.

Rent collection

There has also been laxity in the collection of rent from shopping complexes owned by the Corporation.

472,2020/01/09,Odisha presence in fete,"They learnt the language. Now, they are becoming familiar with the State’s culture and art forms.

Twenty-five women from Odisha will represent the district when the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority’s State-level continuing education arts festival kicks off at University College on Friday.

Part of the mission’s Changathi literacy programme that teaches migrant workers Malayalam, the women will do their adopted State proud when they present dances such as Thiruvathira, Oppana, folk dance, group dance, Bharatanatyam, and Kolkali, Malayalam group song and patriotic song, in the three-day festival. They will also take part in painting, reading, handwriting, and recitation competitions.

The performers range in age between 19 and 45 years and are employed with Texport Industries Pvt. Ltd. at the Kinfra Apparel Park in Kazhakuttam. Kavitha P., class coordinator and welfare officer at Texport, says this is the first festival in which the women are taking part. They have been trained by Deepthi R. Nair, a dance instructor.

Kavitha says when she told the 100-odd women about the festival and urged them to become part of it, less than 15 turned up. When the training began, some others hovered around. Soon, they had been talked into joining, and from them those showing the maximum talent were selected.

Kavitha says the Texport MD extended all support to the women.

“Both the teacher and the women have given it their all. Probably, it became possible because they were like a clean slate and could be taught from scratch as they had some inherent talent.”

474,2020/01/09,Paddy procurement: APSCSC likely to go for ₹3000-cr. loan,"Andhra Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation will have to avail a loan of ₹3,000 crore from the banks to facilitate uninterrupted procurement of paddy from farmers. The loan is to meet the working capital requirements for procurement.

The corporation is negotiating with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and is likely to be finalised in a couple of days. It is “forced to avail” itself of the cash credit in view of the meagre internal resources.

According to information, the State government has given its nod to raise the loan and negotiate with the banks. The corporation has been asked to ensure that the interest rate is negotiated to the lowest possible level. The corporation has resolved to opt for ₹3,000 crore loan with the government guarantee. The NABARD, in principle, has agreed to sanction the loan. But, there is a hitch. The NABARD is insisting that the corporation should “take the term loan.” The corporation, however, asked the NABARD “to rethink” on its proposal as the term loan will be disadvantageous to the corportion, sources say.

The loan is, usually, repaid as and when the government releases the subsidy component, which is shared by both Central and State governments, on the foodgrains procured and distributed through the Public Distribution System.

The total requirement will be much more if the procurement is as per expectations. The corporation may have to pay more than ₹9,300 crore to the farmers. On an average, the corporation makes payments worth ₹200 crore per day. “Another ₹2,250 crore is required if the procurement crossed 50 lakh metric tons. It takes the total bank loan to ₹5,250 crore,” says a senior official who did not want to be quoted. One of the reasons for borrowing is the delay in the release of the Central government’s share in the procurement process.

In the normal course, the Centre reimburses the expenditure incurred by the government on procurement, storage and distribution of stocks through the totally decentralised procurement process. Also, the corporation has about ₹500 crore to ₹1,000 crore in its kitty right now. “As the corporation has to pay the farmers within 72 hours of procurement and also to keep the momentum of the procurement, it is necessary to borrow the loan,” explains the official.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/paddy-procurement-apscsc-likely-to-go-for-3000-cr-loan/article30520205.ece

483,2020/01/09,"Operations normal at VSP, port","Functioning of industries was partially hit with the contract workers and non-executive employees owing allegiance to various trade unions abstaining from work in response to the call for nationwide general strike on Wednesday.

While the central trade unions gave the call for general strike to protest against what they said ‘anti-labour’ policies of the NDA Government at the Centre and the move to give away lands of RINL for a joint venture with POSCO.

The business went as usual in defence establishments. In Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), the largest industry in the State, 80% of the contract workers and non-executives boycotted duty, according to officials. They said 98% of the executives reported to work. For the first time, the management asked the executives to report at 6 a.m. and stay till 6 p.m.

Civilian employees owing allegiance to NSTL Civlian Employees’ Union staged a dharna at NSTL main gate, according to the union general secretary Ch.V.S.N. Murthy. A rally was taken out at Gujuwaka by trade unions and political parties barring BJP in protest against the VSP joint venture with POSCO and delay in granting of captive mines. In separate statements, J. Ayodhyaram (CITU), Mantri Rajasekhar (INTUC) and D. Adinarayana (AITUC) said nearly 30,000 contract workers, project staff and non-executives of the VSP did not report for their duties.

At Visakhapatnam port, loading and unloading operations were normal. A port spokesman said only a few workers abstained from duty. Same was the situation at Gangavaram port. Several contract workers did not report to work at NTPC Simhadri Super Thermal Station, but power production remained unaffected. “All the permanent employees reported for work,” an official said.

In Hindustan Shipyard Limited and HPCL Visakh Refinery, the strike did not have any impact.

484,2020/01/09,Bandh evokes tepid response in city,"The nationwide bandh call given by the Left and non-BJP parties in protest against the “anti-people policies” of the NDA government evoked a tepid response in the city on Wednesday as the normal life remained unaffected through out the day, barring a few hours in the morning.

Activists owing allegiance to the Left parties and various trade unions and members of bank unions took out rallies and staged rasta rokos at several places in the city. As a precautionary measure, all the government and private schools declared holiday.

RTC buses plied without any interruption in all parts of the district including Visakha Agency, while commercial establishments, cinema theatres, daily markets, shopping malls were remained open.

Anticipating problem, police personnel in huge numbers were deployed at all major junctions, bus stations, railway stations in the city since early morning.

Activists of CPI, CPI(M), AITUC, CITU, and a few other worker unions took out rallies and staged demonstrations at Maddilapalem, RTC Complex, Jagadamba Junction, Saraswati Park, NAD Junction, Gajuwaka and other areas. Left party activists formed a human chain at Maddilapalem Junction.

Extending support to the bandh, several minority organisations took out rallies, carrying effigy of Prime Minister Narrendra Modi. They opposed the National Register of Citizens (NRC) Bill and Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Several trade unions, with the help of minority associations, took out a rally at Jagadamba Junction.

Several CPI and CPI (M) leaders including J.V. Satyanarayana were detained at various police stations. They were released later in the day. The Left parties condemned the arrests.

Meanwhile, unions of auto-rickshaw drivers, street vendors, municipal corporation, RTC contract outsourcing, rented bus drivers, banks and others took part in the protest at several places. Unions from Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), HPCL and others staged peaceful protests.

Privatisation of PSUs

“After assuming power, the BJP has been amending the laws in favour of the factory managements. PSUs such as ONGC, HPCL, NTPC, Railways, BSNL and others are being proposed for privatisation. The NDA government has failed to control the hike in prices of essential commodities,” said CITU State president Ch. Narsinga Rao while addressing the protesters. B. Ganga Rao, secretary Greater Visakha City Committee of CPI(M) alleged that the Centre had been maintaining silence on the Special Category Status (SCS) or other financial aid to Andhra Pradesh and the State government was also not at all bothered. “The police arrested over 40 activists when the Left parties were staging peaceful protests,” he said.

In response to the call given by Bank Employees’ Federation of India, members of Visakhapatnam Bank Staff Council staged a demonstration in front of the regional office of Union Bank. The protesters demanded minimum wage of ₹21,000 for employees and immediate wage revision in banking industry.

485,2020/01/09,‘Students being used as pawns for political gain in Amaravati’,"Alleging that students are being used as pawns in agitation for political gain in Amaravati, former TDP MLA S.A. Rehaman on Wednesday said that the latter should be provided with a conducive ambience to continue their studies.

“Political parties are misguiding students and involving them in protests. This is a dangerous trend,” he told the media while referring to the violence occurred in Guntur on Tuesday over the proposal on shifting of the Capital.

Mr. Rehaman, who resigned from the post of TDP (urban) president recently, took a dig at party president N. Chandrababu Naidu. “The TDP chief is opposing the plan of making Visakhapatnam as the Executive Capital. He did not come out openly demanding the scrapping of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), he said.

Mr. Rehaman further alleged that that Mr. Naidu had ruined the TDP over dynasty politics.

“He (Mr. Naidu) is ignoring senior party leaders to promote his son Lokesh,” he said.

He suggested that Mr. Naidu, being among the senior most leaders in the State, should help Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to develop the State instead of “indulging in bad politics”. “Mr. Naidu should take the lead to speak to Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy and work out an amicable solution for Amaravati farmers. Instigating farmers for agitation will not help,” observed Mr. Rehaman.

‘Derogatory comments’

Mr. Rehaman also criticised the TDP president for “making derogatory comments G.N. Rao, who heads the committee on decentralisation of capital”. “Mr. Naidu should welcome the proposal as Sivaramakrishna Committee had also given a similar report, which was ignored by him,” added Mr. Rehaman.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/a29mhj/article30517655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09VZ3FORMARVUDACHAIRMANDRSARAHAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/students-being-used-as-pawns-for-political-gain-in-amaravati/article30517656.ece

Among the vacant sites, 400 acres developed at Kapulauppada for IT City on the outskirts is one of the probable sites for Executive capital, which needs construction of Secretariat, Chief Minister’s camp office, Assembly building for summer

sessions, staff and officers’ quarters.

Sites have been identified at Mudasarlova and somewhere between Bheemili and Anandapuram with indications that the capital zone, if decided, would come up in between the two locations, at an ideal distance from Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam. The area is close to the beach and abutting the highway, now being converted into six-lanes.

Millennium Tower

The talk is that the officials have identified Millennium Tower-A with a built-up area of two lakh sft and Tower-B now under construction with an area of one lakh sft with ample parking space are identified as ‘make-shift’ Secretariat. Both are located at sea-facing Rushikonda Hills.

Half a dozen vacant buildings at the IT Special Economic Zone, Rushikonda, may also be taken on lease along with VMRDA row houses in the area, which are lying vacant for a long time. These maybe used for housing quarters as well as some departments.

VMRDA office building at Siripuram, buildings of Wipro and Tech Mahindra, which are either lying vacant or allotted to BPOs and startups, some of the buildings of Andhra University Engineering College, AU Platinum Jubilee Guesthouse, Collector’s Bungalow and Circuit House may also be considered for CM’s camp office and the offices top bureaucrats and department buildings.

Startup Village

The APIIC’s Incubation Tower (erstwhile Startup Village) at Rushikonda with 50,000 sft, which is allotted to AP Innovation Society and some incubators may be taken over for housing some departments. The government officials have also identified some of the high-end apartments to be taken on lease.

487,2020/01/09,Capital talk sends real estate prices zooming,"Even before a final decision was taken, the idea of making the city the Executive capital of Andhra Pradesh has led to unprecedented speculation on the growth potential of Visakhapatnam, popularly known as Vizag, City of Destiny, Waltair, Port City and Steel City, leading to revival of realty business and heavy demand for plots and flats.

On an average, the plots as well as flats on the city outskirts have witnessed an increase in prices by 20% to 25%. Though the realty sector was on the downslide owing to prolonged economy slowdown, to its pleasant surprise it has seen a dramatic revival of fortunes close on the heels of overcoming the crisis in availability of sand.

The demand is more for acquiring properties towards Bheemunipatnam and Anandapuram, where a lot of vacant government sites are available with good highway connectivity.

Good response

The response was evident in a recent expo organised by CREDAI with a footfall of 20,000. “We were also taken aback with a record number of bookings. We expect the trend to gain momentum and a fillip in demand once a final decision is taken to set up the Executive capital in Visakhapatnam, which has all the ingredients to become a world-class city,” CREDAI local chapter president B. Srinivasa Rao told The Hindu.

CREDAI also projects a highly successful year for the real estate sector in the New Year. It expects a construction boom with the Union government deciding to give a booster dose to the sector.

Despite the agitation by the farmers of 29 villages in the Amaravati capital region, the ruling YSR Congress Party and a section of Telugu Desam Party leaders are of the opinion that establishing Executive capital in the city would bring about a permanent end to backwardness of North Andhra.

“Several big ticket projects will come to Visakhapatnam once Secretariat and other buildings come up in the city making it a hub for administration,” remarked Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao defending the three capital proposal to ensure decentralised development.

Visakhapatnam is the largest city in the State with cosmopolitan culture. It has robust industrial and social infrastructure. While Visakhapatnam Port was set up in 1933, Hindustan Shipyard Limited (earlier known Scindia Steam Navigation) came up in 1941. It is also known as IT capital and financial capital of AP.

Tourist spot

The city is popular for its scenic beaches and valleys. Buddhist sites all along the Visakhapatnam-Bheemunipatnam beach road further make it an attractive destination for tourists. It is ‘love at first sight’ for those visiting the city whether they are from other States or abroad because of warmth of the people, cosmopolitan outlook and panoramic view of the various locales in and around the city.

The Bhogapuram International Airport, for which the erstwhile TDP Government had initiated the Land Pooling Scheme will get a shot in the arm besides taking up work on Metro Rail with massive investment from Bhogapuram in Vizianagaram district to Anakapalle in Visakhapatnam covering a distance of 100 km. The project comprising 10 corridors connecting Bhogapuram to Kurmannapalem and Lankalapalem in the industrial area via National Highway passing through the city, if cleared, will be taken up under the PPP mode.

As the INS Dega Airport is under the control of Navy, slowly domestic and international flight operations will be relocated to Bhogapuram, which is ideally located with easy access to the people of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/6ij63s/article30517607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/220933259col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/capital-talk-sends-real-estate-prices-zooming/article30517608.ece
488,2020/01/09,"From the Archives (January 9, 1970): Cabinet decides to abolish privy purses","The talks which the Union Home Minister, Mr. Y.B. Chavan, held with the representatives of the Concord of Princes on the question of abolition of Privy purses and privileges failed to produce a mutual agreement on the issue. Mr. Chavan told the princes that the Union Cabinet had come to the firm conclusion earlier in the morning that steps should be taken to abolish the privy purses of rulers. He also made it clear to them that it was Government’s intention to amend the Constitution to enable implementation of this proposal. From the nature of the statements and declarations made by the representatives of former rulers during the last few days it was apparent that they would not be a willing party to the abolition of Privy purses and privileges as proposed by the Government. In fact during, to-day’s discussions. The princes questioned the very basis of the decision of the Government and reminded the Home Minister that Privy purses were governed by certain solemn agreements and pledges given to them by the Union Government. Mr. Chavan explained to them that the various agreements entered into with the former Rulers in regard to payment of privy purses were rather political in nature and therefore it would be prudent not to take too legalistic a view of them. Obviously Mr. Chavan had in mind the opinion expressed by a certain section of the Princes that the agreements with them were more in the nature of contracts the breach of which could be questioned in courts of law and suitable remedy obtained. The Princes’ representatives were however, not convinced of the arguments advanced by Mr. Chavan. They referred to the assurances given by Sardar Patel and more recently the views expressed by Mr. Morarji Desai in regard to the sanctity of the agreements conferring privy purses. The Home Minister, however, told them that reference to the historical aspect of the question would serve no practical purpose. The facts were well-known and it was the desire of the people at large that in a Socialistic society there was no place for special privileges as were now being enjoyed by the former rulers. He also told them that great changes had taken place in society and it would be wise to keep pace with the progressive ideas.",archives,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/archives/cabinet-decides-to-abolish-privy-purses/article30517420.ece
489,2020/01/09,"From the Archives (January 9, 1920): Moderates and Civil Rights.","The “Tribune” writes in the course of a leading article: While the Congress demands a declaration of Indian rights as an essential safeguard against the recurrence of a tragedy like that of April as well as against the enactment of repressive legislation affecting personal liberty or calculated to hamper political progress the Moderates’ Conference suggests among other things, that “the introduction, exercise and duration of Martial Law should be subject to the same constitutional limitations as in England,” and that “a safeguard in the nature of habeas corpus should be available in all parts of British India”. Regarding the latter suggestion we do not think there is any difference of opinion between the Congress and Moderates’ Conference, while as regards the first, what the Congress would probably say is that the use of the phrase “the same constitutional limitations as in England” is a piece of self-deception for the simple reason that the constitution in the one case not being the same thing as in the other, even “the same constitutional limitations” might mean two different things in the two cases. We do not forget what the President of the Conference said on this subject in his speech. “The proper line of progress,” he said, “is in the direction of the development of powers of the Indian legislature and the introduction of the responsibility of the Central Government towards the Indian legislature, and the enactment of a fundamental law by a superior authority restricting the powers of the Indian legislature is inconsistent with the true goal and bound to be embarrassing in practice.”",archives,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/archives/moderates-and-civil-rights/article30516524.ece
490,2020/01/09,Between fiction and non fiction,"To get the right title for a book is perhaps a greater challenge than writing the book itself. Emmanuel Carrere calls his latest collection of essays, “97196 Words”. Now if you wonder what it contains, is it fiction or non-fiction etc., you are quintessentially asking for Carrere’s profile.

Carrere answers, “I don’t care very much about genres…I did write novels for more than ten years. Now what I write is not fiction, you can call it non-fiction. I try to write it as a novel, the difference being that the characters have not come from my imagination. But I craft the story like a novel. I hope it gives the pleasure and excitement that one expects from a novel.”

He continues, “I was writing about Jean Claude Romand who was the worst type of criminal…It was very difficult for me to write as non fiction about how he had cold bloodedly planned all the murders. I began writing this in 1993 but the book The Adversary was published only in 2000…I had it in the back of my mind all these seven years. It was some kind of a psychological ordeal to do that terrible story…I met him in jail, I attended his trial…there was a moment when it came to me that I had to write it like fiction, not fiction, but with true facts. I had a legal responsibility because if I got any fact wrong I could be sued…it was also around the same time that I switched writing from first person to third person…I think both these changes are linked very closely..when it is fiction the writer knows everything about the characters. But if you have to write something about Romand whose mind is a black box to which you have no access…it is immoral and complicated to say Romand thinks like this or feels like that. The only way tomanage that is to say,” I guess…I think…I suspect…he was thinking like this. So third person becomes essential.”

Carrere redefines the idea of non fiction saying, “When you are writing non fiction you cannot be claiming to be writing the truth. You can at best say it is your truth…it could be a very narrow truth. You have to be aware of that and so too your readers. Another reason why I made this change and now I can not imagine any other way of writing. This is how I feel more honest with myself, with my readers and the characters in the book.”

Carrere also writes in Russian. His mother was of Russian origin and a well known expert on Russia in France. “We, my sisters and I grew up very French, but some memories of Russia still give me a comfort an warmth. So I learnt Russian and am able to write somethings in Russian which I may not be able to do in French. Russian is both familiar and unfamiliar…”",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/between-fiction-and-non-fiction/article30522629.ece
491,2020/01/09,A glorious tradition,"Faiz Ahmed ‘Faiz’, a communist who all his life fought the tyranny of Pakistani rulers and lived for decades in political exile, must be turning in his grave as the Hindutva forces have discovered a Muslim Faiz, thirty-six years after his death. Faiz was despised by the Islamists in Pakistan because he successfully used Islamic symbols to oppose the tyranny of both Islamic clergy and military dictators like Zia-ul-Haq who used Islam to further political goals. Every poet uses the symbols from his tradition to convey his poetry to his audience that is familiar with that tradition. But, we have reached a situation in our country where a government school headmaster in Uttar Pradesh can be suspended because children in his school sing a beautiful poem of Allama Iqbal titled “Bachche ki Dua” (A child’s prayer) and accused of turning a government school into a madarsa.

In the same manner, a teacher in IIT-Kanpur recently complained against those who were protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act and singing Faiz’s celebrated poem “Hum Dekhenge” (We shall see). Why? Because it used the world “Allah” and not “Rama” and because Faiz was a Pakistani. Another charge was later added that the poem was anti-Hindu as it spoke of the removal of idols from Kaaba. The absurdity of these charges is obvious. Even a child knows that “Bhagwan”, “Ishwar”, “God” and “Allah” are synonyms. Poetry, especially resistance poetry, is universal and inspires people across continents. Faiz, who was a close friend of revolutionary poets such as Nazim Hikmat, Pablo Neruda, Ernesto Cardenal and Mahmood Darvesh, continues to inspire to this day all those who rise in opposition to tyranny. And he belongs to a glorious tradition of such poets in Urdu itself.

Virtual ban

Let’s first take a look at the history of this particular poem. Reciting Faiz’s works was not allowed in Zia regime that had also imposed a virtual ban on women wearing sari, as it was considered to be Indian and Hindu. When Faiz’s first death anniversary was observed in Lahore, famous singer Iqbal Bano wore a black sari and sang “Ham Dekhenge”.

It electrified the atmosphere as the poem contained lines that spoke of the coming days when the illegitimate rule of the tyrant will come to an end and people will become the arbiter of their destiny. No wonder that this poem came to acquire an iconic status and continues to inspire all those who rise to oppose injustice or abuse of power anywhere in the world.

“Jab arz-e-khuda ke ka’abe se, sab buut uthwaae jaayenge / Hum ahl-e-safa mardood-e-haram, masnad pe bithaaye jaayenge / Sab taaj uchhale jaayenge, sab takht giraaye jaayenge/ Bas naam rahega Allah ka… (From the abode of God, when the idols will be removed/ When we, the faithful, who have been barred from sacred places, will be seated on a high pedestal/ When crowns will be tossed, when thrones will be brought down, only Allah’s name will remain.) Only those who do not understand religion would not know that in every religion, God or Allah or Ishwar is equated with Truth.

Sufi mystic Mansur was hanged (according to some sources beheaded) for declaring “Analhaq” (I am the Truth). This poem of Faiz also speaks of the slogan of Analhaq and of a future when “raaj karegi khalk-e-khuda, jo main bhi hoon aur tum bhi ho” (people of God who are you as well as me will rule). Opposing idol worship is certainly not against the Hindus. If that were so, why don’t the Hindutva forces demand a ban on Satyarth Prakash, written by Swami Dayanand Saraswati who was a fierce opponent of idol worship.

The fact is that poets like Faiz are pro-people and anti-democratic forces everywhere despise such poets. Pakistani poet Habib Jalib spent many years in jail as he had the courage to tell the rulers of his day that their predecessors too had similarly believed that they had become God. Iqbal too exhorted people to burn a field if it failed to provide grain to the poor. Our own Majaz spoke of the need to demolish the edifice of the present-day exploitative society.

So long as people remain suppressed and oppressed, poets like Faiz will continue to take their side and rise in revolt against the illegitimacy of the established authority.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/afbqr3/article30521962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Cover-of-Faiz,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/a-glorious-tradition/article30521963.ece
492,2020/01/09,The Mazaak Factory: Creating a stage for stand-up,"Every day Ashwin Alphonso, a consultant with a multi-national company transforms into his alter ego — founder of the comedy production house The Mazaak Factory (TMF). He utilises his Metro travel time to curate stand-up shows, contact ticketing websites and discuss the line-up with other comics.

Ashwin’s The Mazaak Factory has been the force behind several shows that have been enjoyed in the city. “I tried stand-up comedy but it didn’t work initially,” admits Ashwin, part of Toastmasters for three years. The process took a few months and he began with spots (doing a six-minute set before the main stand-up stars step in) and now he collaborates and headlines shows.

Rajasekhar Mamidanna during a session

The journey with TMF began in 2017 when Ashwin made attempts to enliven the stand-up scene in Secunderabad and began hosting shows in Café Avail in Sainikpuri. “Stand-up comedy is a good proposition to sit and relax, but for those living in Secunderabad, there were not many options; they had to travel to Banjara Hills or Jubilee Hills to watch stand-up.” Mazaak Factory that started with a working title (“I didn’t want a fancy name and I didn’t know that it will continue so long”) currently curates two kinds of shows. He explains, “Popular comics from across the country take their ‘one-hour specials’ to different cities. I take care of logistics and ticketing for them in Hyderabad. TMF also plans theme-based shows and curate them to put it online.

TMF’s aim is to provide a platform to local comics. Some shows are intimate with an audience of only 30 people. “Depending on sales, the team organises multiple shows so these comedians get more visibility. During big shows, we create a space for comics who do not have an online presence to stage their small acts. It helps them to learn, gain confidence and grow in the field.”

In two years, TMF has worked with Sandesh Johnny, Vivek Muralidharan, Hriday Ranjan, Rajashekar Mamidanna and Rohit Swain. “There is no comic from Hyderabad who has not done a show with us. If they have been in the scene, then they are with us,” Ashwin says with pride.

Their shows have now moved to Banjara Hills and Gachibowli for practical reasons. “We did our last show in Secunderabad in January 2019. These venues (at Banjara and Gachibowli) are monetarily good and the audience is open-minded.”

Co-working spaces too have opened their doors to comedy shows. TMF collaborates with Coworking24 and CLOwork. “We use the venue after office hours. Some shows work and some don’t, but there is a steady rise in numbers,” he says and gives an example of Funny Side-up which has been producing comedy shows for the past four years. “Their success didn’t come overnight. Hyderabad-based comedians Rajasekhar Mamidanna, Saikiran and Rohit Swain have created a niche after years of hard work.”

His experience in curating shows has improved his writing too and he has began doing both solo shows and performing with Rajasekhar Mamidanna. He says, “I learnt a lot about production and realised what goes on stage is only 10% and 90% is behind the scenes. Stand-up is not just about a comic talking on stage; the auditorium, right acoustics and lighting, all go into making the show a success.”

493,2020/01/09,Meet the girl from Chennai who unearths shipwrecks,"When Madhumathy Chandrasekaran first started swimming lessons at the age of four, little did she realise that her love for water would lead her onto a path-breaking career: she says she is India’s first female maritime archaeologist. Currently a scuba diving instructor at Bond Water Sports in Kovalam, Kerala, 24-year-old Madhumathy has also dived in the waters of Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Cambodia and Australia among others.

She tells MetroPlus about her life, career, and future plans.

Tell us about your early influences and love for the sea.

I was born and raised in Chennai. I started taking swimming lessons when I was very young and my parents always told me how difficult it was to get me to come out of the water. Being an absolute water baby, it was not surprising that I was mesmerised by large bodies of water.

How did you embark on this career?

I have always been fascinated by history, which, combined with my love for the sea, made maritime archaeology a great career choice for me. I joined a Masters programme in Maritime Archaeology at Flinders University, Australia. The faculty was amazing and I was hooked from day one.

What exactly is Maritime Archaeology?

Maritime Archaeology or ‘MARCH’ is basically conducting archaeology underwater or on anything marine related.

Take lighthouses for example: even though they are not submerged, conducting research on them is considered part of maritime archaeology. My field of interest is nautical archaeology, within which I conduct research on historical shipwrecks.

What was it like being part of the team that discovered South Australia’s oldest shipwreck?

I was amongst three Masters MARCH students from Flinders who were chosen as volunteers for the search for South Australia’s oldest shipwreck. It was a privilege to work with the team which consisted of some veteran maritime archaeologists and divers.

Initially, it was difficult to find the shipwreck because of bad weather conditions. But luckily, on the fifth day, one of the team members encountered a hard metal object which when brought to the surface, turned out to be a copper bolt that was used to attach wooden planks together for the ship.

It was hard work and we were diving in cold water with strong currents. It was one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had.

What are your plans for the future ?

My goal is to pursue MARCH in India. I want to focus my research here because there is so much to be explored in this country.

Since I am also a scuba instructor, I would like to reach out to archaeologists in Indian universities and get them to train in scuba diving, which would enable them to do archaeological projects underwater.

Tell us about your love for scuba diving.

I first came to know about it from SB Aravind, who started Temple Adventures, a dive centre in Puducherry. Right from my first dive, I realised that this was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.

I went on to complete my first professional diving course, Divemaster, in 2014 when I was 19.

In 2015, I got a job in the Cook Islands, near Fiji, where I also did my instructor course. At that time, I was India’s youngest female scuba instructor.

Do you have any interesting underwater incidents to share?

I was diving in the Cook Islands when I spotted a big, gorgeous sea turtle, and he was very shy in the beginning. He started to warm up to me and during my last dive, made eye contact with me for a long time and we were happily swimming side by side. I was in love.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/7qw2bz/article30523088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09mpMadhu1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/meet-this-diver-who-investigates-shipwrecks-and-swims-alongside-giant-turtles/article30523092.ece
