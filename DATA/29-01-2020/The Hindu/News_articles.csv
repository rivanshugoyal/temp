1,2020/01/29,Premier Badminton League | Liew stuns Yiu in decisive rubber as Hunters win,"Daren Liew turned out to be the unlikely hero as Hyderabad Hunters got off to a bright start at home with a 2-1 win over North-Eastern Warriors in the Premier Badminton League at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Wednesday.

With the match tied 1-1, thanks to a brilliant display by the Hunters pair of Ben Lane and Vladimir Ivanov in the Trump match for Warriors, World No. 42 Liew shocked World No. 18 Lee Cheuk Yiu 15-9, 15-10 in the final match to seal the contest for Hunters.

Liew’s precision while picking the corners, and combining big smashes with some solid netplay, settled the issue in his favour.

Sindhu disappoints

Earlier, P.V. Sindhu, playing for the first time as a World champion in front of her home crowd, disappointed against Michelle Li who outsmarted the Indian 15-8, 15-9.

Michelle raced to an 8-2 lead in the first game with a fine blend of smashes and delicate net dribbles even as Sindhu committed quite a few unforced errors.

In the second, Sindhu started off with her trademark smash and a couple of stunning cross-court smashes to lead 5-3, but soon saw the opponent fight back, scoring eight points in-a-row to snatch an 11-5 lead and eventually win. The evening began with the Hunters duo of Ivanov and N. Sikki Reddy getting the better of G. Krishna Prasad and Kim Ha Na 15-12, 8-15, 15-12.

Sourabh loses

The men’s singles, a Trump for Hunters, proved a disappointing one as World No. 28 Sourabh Verma lost a close encounter to World No. 38 Tanongsak Sansomboonsuk 15-14, 15-14. .

Praggnanandhaa moved to joint second with six points after his opponent and top-seed Shakhriyar Mamedyarov withdrew from the eighth round due to illness in the Masters category of the 18th Gibraltar Chess Festival here. The 14-year-old Praggnanandhaa shared the second spot with four others.

Four-way tie

The 17-year-old Russian Andrey Esipenko, the 19-year old Iranian Parham Maghsoodloo, David Paravyan (Russia) and China’s Wango Hao were tied for the top spot with 6.5 points out of 8.

GM Vaibhav Suri got the better of Ritvars Reimanis in 53 moves to take his tally to five points while B. Adhiban, the top-ranked Indian in the event, drew his game against 13-year old compatriot D. Gukesh.

3,2020/01/29,Railway women stun Petroleum in National table tennis championship,"Sagarika Mukherjee kept her cool to stun former National champion Madhurika Patkar and put the finishing touches to Railways’ stunning 3-2 win over fancied Petroleum for a place in the women’s team final of the National table tennis championship here on Wednesday.

In fact, Takeme Sarkar’s twin wins for Railways and Madhurika’s twin losses for Petroleum proved decisive. Railways now faces defending champion Bengal ‘A’ in the final. Bengal also came through a tough 3-2 margin over Haryana.

In the men’s section, after claiming the last of its four titles in 1983, Delhi stunned second seed Gujarat 3-0 to reach the title-clash against Petroleum.

Though the result of the final is a foregone conclusion in favour of the indomitable Petroleum — an easy 3-0 winner over host Telangana that reached the semifinal after 1969 — it was indeed a stellar performance from Delhi.

Finding his form

An otherwise struggling Sudhanshu Grover found his form against Ishaan Hingorani to win in straight sets. Parth Virmani caused a big upset by stunning Manush Shah in five sets.

What followed was a ‘battle of generations’ between 16-year-old Payas Jain and Jignesh Jaiswal, who turned 42 on Wednesday. Jaiswal, a regular at National championships for over two decades, had his moments but lacked the energy to match the alacrity to prove stronger against the reigning National junior champion.

The results: Men: Semifinals: Petroleum bt Telangana 3-0 (Sharath Kamal bt S.F.R. Snehit 11-7, 8-11, 11-4, 11-5; G. Sathiyan bt Aman Balgu 11-3, 11-2, 11-3; Harmeet Desai bt Mohammad Ali 11-5, 11-5, 12-10).

Delhi bt Gujarat 3-0 (Sudhanshu Grover bt Ishaan Hingorani 11-0, 11-4, 11-5; Parth Virmani bt Manush Shah 11-9, 10-12, 11-7, 6-11, 11-8; Payas Jain bt Jignesh Jaiswal 14-12, 11-7, 8-11, 11-5).

Quarterfinals: Petroleum bt Maharashtra ‘A’ 3-0; Telangana bt TTTA 3-1; Delhi bt Bengal ‘A’ 3-1; Haryana bt Gujarat 3-1.

Women: Semifinals: Bengal ‘A’ bt Haryana 3-2 (Prapti Sen bt Riti Shankar 12-10, 11-3, 11-7; Mousumi Paul lost to Sutirtha Mukherjee 7-11, 7-11, 3-11; Surbhi Patwari bt Suhana Saini 2-11, 11-9, 11-9, 11-7; Prapti lost to Sutirtha 11-2, 11-5, 11-7; Mousumi bt Riti 11-4, 14-12, 11-6).

4,2020/01/29,Watch | Javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra qualifies for Tokyo Olympics,"Star javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra has qualified for the Tokyo Olympics with a throw of 87.86m at the ACNE League meeting, making an impressive return to the circuit after recovering from an elbow injury.

The 22-year-old Indian, who missed the entire 2019 season due to the injury, breached the Olympic qualification mark of 85m in his fourth attempt and secured the top place at the international event on Tuesday.

He threw the spear to 81.76 m at the start and kept improving with every throw. He managed 82 m in his second attempt and 82.57 in the third.

Another Indian in fray, Rohit Yadav threw 77.61m to finish second. The other three competitors did not even touch the 70m mark.

Neeraj had missed the IAAF World Championships, the Diamond League and the Asian Championships while recovering from the injury.

His last major international competition was the 2018 Jakarta Asian Games where he won gold with a national record of 88.06m.

The Indian had undergone a surgery in May 2019 to treat the injury. He was expected to compete at the National Championship late last year but the AFI didn’t give him clearance, allowing him more time to heal.

National record holder K.T. Irfan had became the first Indian from athletics to qualify for the 2020 Olympics when he finished fourth in the 20km event of the Asian Race Walking Championships in Nomi, Japan in March 2019.

5,2020/01/29,Final moments of Kobe's fatal helicopter crash revealed by investigators,"Moments before Los Angeles basketball icon Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and the seven others perished in a helicopter crash, the pilot had tried to climb out of a layer of clouds, but the aircraft then banked sharply and lurched towards the ground.

The twin-engine Sikorsky S-76B slammed into a hillside, 60 seconds later and burst into flames, killing all nine people on board, according to details revealed on Tuesday by federal aviation safety officials.

The death of Bryant, 41, an 18-time NBA all-star and one of the most admired athletes around the globe, sent shockwaves through the sports and entertainment worlds.

Investigators with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) estimated that Bryant's luxury passenger helicopter hit the ground at a speed of more than 2,000 feet (610 m) per minute.

Also read | NBA legend Kobe Bryant killed in helicopter crash

“This is a pretty steep descent at high speed,” NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy told a briefing in Calabasas, a town adjacent to the crash scene, about 40 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

“The time from descent to impact was probably about a minute.”

Radar data showed that the helicopter had ascended to 2,300 feet. “He was trying to climb out of the cloud layer at the time and then began a left descending turn before air traffic control lost contact,” Ms. Homendy said.

Investigators have offered no explanation for what might have led the aircraft to bank abruptly to one side and then plummet to the ground. But Ms. Homendy said that the estimated rate of descent wouldn't be a normal landing speed.

“We know this was a higher-energy-impact crash,” she said, adding that investigators had surmised that the helicopter was still in one piece before hitting the ground.

Safety Reommendations unheeded

Ms. Homendy said that clouds, fog and limited visibility reported in the area on Sunday were a key focus of the investigation, which will take at least a year to complete.

The helicopter was not equipped with any kind of terrain awareness and warning system, a device that might have alerted the pilot that the aircraft was dangerously close to the hillside. Nor did the chopper carry a “black box” flight data recorder, which would make it easier to piece together the cause of the crash.

“NTSB recommends that both devices be required equipment on helicopters like the one that crashed on Sunday have not been implemented by the Federal Aviation Administration,” she added.

Ms. Homendy briefed reporters as authorities completed the on-scene phase of the investigation, clearing the tall, grassy slope of remaining wreckage and human remains.

Among items recovered were an iPad that investigators hope may have belonged to the pilot for use in tracking flight and weather information, Ms. Homendy said.

The NTSB team carted a truckload of debris wrapped in large, white tarp bags while medical examiners positively identified remains of four victims, including Bryant and the pilot.

Bryant, who retired from the National Basketball Association in 2016 after 20 years with the Los Angeles Lakers, was on his way to a youth sports academy with his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. Her team that he coached was due to compete that day in a tournament.

NTSB officials privately briefed relatives of the dead by telephone on Tuesday, but Ms. Homendy declined to say anything about what was discussed or who took part in the call.

Heartbroken

Speaking at the same news conference, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said that positive identifications had been made on four of the nine victims.

Besides Bryant and the pilot, Ara Zobayan, a commercial aviator and certified flight instructor with more than 8,200 hours of flight experience, medical examiners confirmed the identities of John Altobelli, an Orange Coast College baseball coach.

A fourth positive identification was made for Sarah Chester, who died in the crash with her 13-year-old daughter, Payton, another basketball player involved in the tournament.

Altobelli's wife, Keri, and their 13-year-old daughter, Alyssa, a teammate of Gianna Bryant, were among the dead, along with an assistant coach, Christina Mauser.

Meanwhile, tributes for the Lakers five-time champion forward poured in, including from Lakers current superstar LeBron James, who surpassed Bryant as the NBA's third-highest all-time scorer the night before Bryant's death.

“I'm heartbroken and devastated my brother!!” James wrote on Instagram on Monday night. “I promise you I'll continue your legacy man!”

The NBA cancelled a game scheduled for Staples Center on Tuesday between the Lakers and the Los Angles Clippers, citing the need to give the Lakers franchise time to grieve. The Lakers will return to the court on Friday in a home game against the Portland Trail Blazers, a team spokeswoman said.

Separately, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said the Oscars ceremony on February 9, 2020 would include a salute to Bryant.

Earlier in the day, Bryant received a tribute from his onetime basketball coach at Lower Merion High School in Philadelphia, where Bryant played before he was drafted directly into the NBA as a teenager.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/news/m5dqlc/article30670349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBITBRYANTTHNAK-28jan,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/final-moments-of-kobes-fatal-helicopter-crash-revealed-by-investigators/article30681918.ece

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Tuesday said the government was planning to send a plane to Wuhan and a special Air India flight had got the go-ahead from aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

Speaking on the recently enacted Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday said the law was a measure to correct “historical injustices” and to fulfill the BJP’s “old promise” to religious minorities in India’s neighbourhood. Addressing cadets of the National Cadet Corp (NCC) at the annual rally after the Republic Day parade, Mr. Modi said his government was intent on solving decades-old problems facing the country, looking for lasting solutions to them where previous governments had only seen a law and order issue.

Five groups at the European Parliament tabled a joint motion resolution on Tuesday that “condemned” India’s decision to adopt the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). In a boost for the government’s efforts to counter the resolution, one group of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) with 66 members, that had earlier been a part of the resolution, decided to drop out. The other five groups, representing a total of 560 of the 751 MEPs in the Parliament, have agreed to the joint motion, although it is unclear how many will finally vote for the resolution.

Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday said that the National Population Register (NPR) in its new format would create confusion in the country and suggested that the Centre should therefore continue to retain the old format, which has been in use since 2011. “The NPR has been there since 2011, it’s not a new thing… but, in the new format with more questions it can create confusion in the country,” Mr. Kumar told journalists, while addressing them after a day-long meeting of the JD(U) party at his official residence on Anne Marg.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday accused the BJP government at the Centre of promoting violence by raising divisive issues, which had set the citizens against each other and created an atmosphere of insecurity.

Observing that minorities in India and the U.S. are “actually minorities” and nowhere close to being dominant, Nobel laureate Abhijit Vinayak Banerjee said that he does not feel that it is a “real fear there is going to be a Muslim takeover of India”.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday lifted its seven-year stay on a proposal to introduce African cheetahs from Namibia into the Indian habitat on an experimental basis. The plan was to bolster the nearly extinct Indian cheetah population. In May 2012, the apex court had stalled the plan to initiate the foreign cheetahs into the Palpur Kino sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh fearing they may come into conflict with a parallel and a much-delayed project to reintroduce lions into the same sanctuary. The court was also worried whether the African cheetahs would find the sanctuary a favourable clime as far as abundance of prey is concerned.

Leading low-cost airline IndiGo on Tuesday night announced that it was suspending stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra from flying with IndiGo for six months, as his conduct onboard was unacceptable. Later, Air India announced it would suspend him from flying on any of its flights until further notice.

An airhostess is even heard asking the standup comedian to stop taking the video but Mr. Kamra is heard saying he is willing to go to jail for this.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson granted Huawei a limited role in Britain's 5G mobile network on January 28, resisting U.S. pressure to exclude the Chinese company from next generation communications over fears Beijing could use them to spy.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday proposed creation of a Palestinian state with capital in eastern Jerusalem, dependent on Palestinians taking steps to become self-governing, as part of a peace plan to end decades of conflict in the region. Senior administration officials said that under Mr. Trump’s proposed West Asia peace plan, the U.S. will recognise Israeli settlements on the occupied West Bank. In exchange, Israel would agree to accept a four-year freeze on new settlement activity while Palestinian statehood is negotiated.

The United States said Tuesday it was developing a vaccine against a deadly virus that originated in China, and urged Beijing to step up its cooperation with international health authorities. “We have already started at the NIH and with many of our collaborators on the development of a vaccine,” National Institutes for Health (NIH) official Anthony Fauci told reporters. The process would take three months to start the first trial, three more months to gather data, before being able to move into its second phase. “But we are proceeding as if we will have to deploy a vaccine,” said Mr. Fauci.

13,2020/01/29,"European Parliament ratifies Brexit deal, sealing U.K. exit","Britain's departure from the European Union was set in law Wednesday as, amid emotional scenes, as the bloc's Parliament voted to ratify the divorce papers.

After half a century of sometimes awkward membership and three years of tense withdrawal talks, the U.K. will leave the E.U. at midnight Brussels time (2300 GMT) on Friday.

MEPs voted by 621 votes to 49 to pass the withdrawal agreement, which sees Britain leave the EU institutions but remain under most E.U. rules during a transition until the end of the year. Following the vote, MEPs burst into a chorus of Auld Lang Syne, a traditional Scottish song of farewell.

The transition will see Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government try to negotiate an ambitious, unprecedented in the timeframe, free trade agreement with his 27 former partners remaining in the bloc. “Only in the agony of parting do we look into the depth of love,” E.U. Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told the chamber, quoting British author George Eliot.

“We will always love you and we will never be far. Long live Europe,” she added.

In other words, as French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: “The hardest part lies ahead...we're going to get down to brass tacks now.”

In the Brussels Parliament, many MEPs made it clear that they were voting for the withdrawal deal not out of any support for Brexit, but to avoid the disruption of a chaotic no deal divorce. Some expressed real anguish and regret, and pointed to Britain's role not only in the development of the European Unification project but also to its historic battles against tyranny on the continent.

“If we could stop Brexit by voting 'no' today I would be the first to recommend it,” former Belgian Premier and Chairman of the Parliament's Brexit steering group Guy Verhofstadt said.

“It is indeed a sad issue,” he said, turning to the World Wars of the first half of the last century. “We're sad to see a country leaving that twice liberated us, twice has given its blood to liberate Europe.”

The day began with Britain's permanent representative to the E.U. Tim Barrow, from Saturday to be its ambassador, handing back the withdrawal agreement signed by Johnson, to be stored in Brussels. “This step ensures that the UK has fulfilled its legal obligations regarding our exit,” the British mission said.

Leaving the church

But it was still an emotional day in the European Parliament, steeped in a mixture of nostalgia, political carnival and historical metaphor. Nigel Farage, veteran MEP and leader of Britain's Brexit Party, was in triumphant mood after two decades as a thorn in Brussels' side.

After his final speech in Parliament, in which he described Brexit as a victory for populism over “globalism”, Mr. Farage and his MEPs brandished British flags, in contravention of the rules, then left. “We're going to wave you goodbye,” he declared, as Deputy Speaker Mairead McGuinness cut his microphone.

“If you disobey the rules, you'll get cut off,” she retorted. At an earlier news conference, Mr. Farage said he had loved playing the “pantomime villain” in the Strasbourg Assembly, feeding opposition to Europe at home with theatrical YouTube clips.

But he insisted on the seriousness of Brexit, comparing its significance to King Henry VIII taking Britain out of the Catholic church in 1534. “He took us out of the Church of Rome, and we are leaving the Treaty of Rome,” he said, referring to the E.U.'s 1957 founding document.

Later in the day, Mr. Farage's fellow MEPs gathered for the historic vote to incorporate the withdrawal agreement into E.U. law This was the last legislative act of the 73 remaining British MEPs, and departure was hard for some.

Bagpipe serenade

Iratxe Garcia Perez, the Spanish leader of the Socialist group, choked back tears as she said farewell to her British Labour Party comrades. After Brexit, the United Kingdom will be what the E.U. calls a “third country”, outside the union, but the political and economic drama will continue.

Britain and Europe will apply E.U. rules on trade and free movement of citizens until the end of the year, while negotiating a free trade agreement. In the face of scepticism in E.U. capitals, Johnson insists he is optimistic that a comprehensive free trade deal can be done before the next cliff-edge.

But negotiations between the world's sixth biggest economy and a 27-nation single market with a population of 450 million will be tricky. Fishing rights, residency and working rights for citizens, tariff free trade, access to Europe for Britain's huge services sector: all will be on the table.

“We are considering a free trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas. This would be unique. No other free trade agreement offers such access to our single market,” Ms. von der Leyen said.

“But the pre-condition is that European and British businesses continue to compete on a level playing field. We will not expose our companies to unfair competition,” she warned, to applause.

U.K. goes solo

Mr. Johnson's government hopes more trade with the United States and Asian powers can help offset the costs of Brexit. But the British premier was facing difficult talks on Wednesday with President Donald Trump's Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The U.K. will leave the club it joined in 1973 at midnight Brussels time on Friday, when British flags will be removed from EU offices and the EU flag lowered on the British premises there.

15,2020/01/29,"India urges direct talks between Israel, Palestine","India on Tuesday urged Israel and Palestine to engage directly and explore possibilities of finding an “acceptable” solution to the regional conflict. The comment from the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs came after U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday announced a new plan for resolving the crisis, which has been rejected by the Palestinian side.

“We urge the parties to engage with each other, including on the recent proposals put forward by the U.S., and find an acceptable two-state solution for peaceful coexistence,” said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar.

India has traditionally supported statehood for the Palestinian side and maintained that the two-state solution is the best guarantee for solution of the oldest post-World War II crisis in the West Asian region.

“We reiterate our view that the final status issues should be resolved through direct negotiations between the two parties and be acceptable to both,” said Mr. Kumar.

16,2020/01/29,"UN says committed to supporting Palestinians, Israelis resolve conflict as Trump unveils peace plan","UN chief Antonio Guterres said the global body remains committed to supporting Palestinians and Israelis resolve the conflict on the basis of UN resolutions, international law and bilateral agreements, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled his Middle East peace plan aimed at settling one of the world’s longest disputes.

Flanked by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House on January 28, Mr. Trump proposed a two-state solution and said no Israelis or Palestinians would be uprooted from their homes under his plan.

Describing it as historic and a “giant step” towards peace, he said that under his vision, Jerusalem “will remain Israel’s undivided, very important capital.” He proposed Palestinian capital in Eastern Jerusalem and that U.S. will set up its embassy there.

The Secretary-General has seen the announcement of the United States plan for the Middle East. The position of the United Nations on the two-state solution has been defined, throughout the years, by relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions by which the Secretariat is bound, a statement issued by UN Secretary-General Guterres’ spokesman said here on January 28.

“The world body remains committed to supporting Palestinians and Israelis to resolve the conflict on the basis of United Nations resolutions, international law and bilateral agreements and realizing the vision of two States — Israel and Palestine — living side by side in peace and security within recognized borders, on the basis of the pre-1967 lines.”

Mr. Trump said the plan calls for a four-year freeze in Israeli settlement activity and doubling of Palestinian territory.

Asserting that his peace plan will more than double the size of Palestinian territory, Mr. Trump said that Palestinian people deserve a far better life “than being trapped in a cycle of terrorism and violence”.

“My vision presents a realistic two-state solution,” he said.

Together we can bring a new dawn in the Middle East, Mr. Trump said as he urged the Palestinians to accept his deal and bring peace in the region.

Calling it a “historic opportunity” for the Palestinians to achieve an independent state, Trump said he has written to Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas on the matter.

No Palestinian official was present at the launch. The ambassadors from three Arab nations — Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain — were at the White House.

However, Mr. Abbas rejected Trump’s plan, saying it will “not pass.”

“After the nonsense that we heard today we say a thousand no’s to the Deal of The Century,” Mr. Abbas said during a press conference on January 28 in the West Bank city of Ramallah.

Mr. Netanyahu hailed Mr. Trump’s plan as “historic day” for Israel. The plan, he said, will strike the “right balance” where other plans have failed.

Mr. Netanyahu said that he is now willing to negotiate peace with the Palestinians “on the basis” of the U.S. peace.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/h2e5hu/article30684540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANSPLAN-PROTESTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-says-committed-to-supporting-palestinians-israelis-resolve-conflict-as-trump-unveils-peace-plan/article30684541.ece

18,2020/01/29,US House passes bill on sanctions against Chinese officials for meddling in Dalai Lama’s succession,"The US House of Representatives has passed a bill that authorises financial and travel sanctions against Chinese officials who interfere in the process of selecting the successor to the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet.

Introduced by Congressman James P. McGovern, Chairman of the House Rules Committee and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, the bill was passed by a overwhelming vote of 392 to 22 on Tuesday.

The bill, if passed by the Senate and signed into law by the President, will also prohibit China from opening any new consulate in the US until Beijing allows Washington to open its diplomatic station in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital.

According to the bill, the succession or reincarnation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including a future 15th Dalai Lama, is an exclusively religious matter that should be decided solely by the Tibetan Buddhist community.

Under the draft legislation, Washington would freeze any American asset and ban US travel of Chinese officials if they are found to be involved in “identifying or installing” a Dalai Lama approved by Beijing.

Addressing the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the bill sends Beijing a clear signal that it will be held accountable for interfering in Tibet’s religious and cultural affairs.

Global Magnitsky Act

The proposed legislation, she said, makes it clear that “Chinese officials who meddle in the process of recognising a new Dalai Lama will be subject to targeted sanctions, including those in the Global Magnitsky Act”.

The Global Magnitsky Act allows the US to sanction foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses anywhere in the world.

Ms. Pelosi said the bill deploys America’s diplomatic weight to encourage a genuine dialogue between Tibetan leaders and Beijing.

“It is unacceptable that the Chinese government still refuses to enter into a dialogue with Tibetan leaders...We are supporting the Tibetan people’s right to religious freedom and genuine autonomy by formally establishing as US policy that the Tibetan Buddhist community has the exclusive right to choose its religious leaders, including a future 15th Dalai Lama,” she said.

Though introduced as a stand-alone piece of legislation, the bill serves as an amendment to the Tibet Policy Act of 2002, which codified the US position of support for the Tibetan people.

“Our bill updates and strengthens the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 to address the challenges facing the Tibetan people. But perhaps as importantly, it reaffirms America’s commitment to the idea that human rights matter. That we care about those who are oppressed, and we stand with those who are struggling for freedom,” Congressman Mr. McGovern said on the House floor.

“It should be clear that we support a positive and productive US-China relationship, but it is essential that the human rights of all the people of China are respected by their government,” he asserted.

Reciprocal system

Last year, the US Congress passed the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, demanding that American journalists, diplomats and tourists be given the same freedom to travel to Tibet that Chinese officials have to travel freely in the US.

“The Dalai Lama should be commended for his decision to devolve political authority to elected leaders. The Tibetan exile community is also to be commended for adopting a system of self-governance with democratic institutions to choose their own leaders, including holding multiple ‘free and fair’ elections to select its Parliament and chief executive,” Mr. McGovern said.

The bill also mandates the US State Department to begin collaborative and multinational efforts to protect the environment and water resources of the Tibetan Plateau.

“We are protecting Tibet’s environmental and cultural rights: working with international governments and the business community to ensure the self-sufficiency of the Tibetan people and protect the environment and water resources on the Tibetan Plateau. It is really important to sustainability of our planet,” Ms. Pelosi, a longtime advocate for Tibet, said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/erdk1i/article30073500.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMDALAILAMa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-house-passes-bill-on-sanctions-against-chinese-officials-for-meddling-in-dalai-lamas-succession/article30682236.ece
19,2020/01/29,Explained | Trump’s Israel-Palestine peace plan,"The West Asia peace plan unveiled by U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday seeks to give the Israelis what they have long wanted — an expansive state with Jerusalem as its “undivided capital” and tight security control over a future Palestinian state. With his plan, Mr. Trump is actually pushing to revive the stalled two-state talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but on his own terms. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had earlier spoken against the two-state solution, has accepted the Trump plan, while appearing beside the President in the White House. The Palestinians were absent.

What’s the plan?

The Trump plan seeks to address most of the contentious issues in the conflict such as the border of Israel, status of Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements on the West Bank, land swap between Israel and Palestine, Israel’s security concerns and the status of the city of Jerusalem. However, the solutions Mr. Trump has proposed to almost all of these issues favour the Israeli positions. For example, Israel would be allowed to annex the Jewish settlements on the West Bank as well as the Jordan Valley. The Palestinian refugees, who were forced out from their homes during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that followed the declaration of the state of Israel in the historic Palestine, would not be allowed to return. They could move to the future Palestinian state, be integrated into the host countries or settled in other regional countries.

Jerusalem, perhaps the most contentious issue, would be “the undivided capital” of Israel, with Palestine gaining its capital in the east of the city — beyond the security border Israel has already built. In return, Israel would freeze further settlement activities on the West Bank for four years — the time for negotiations. During this period, the Palestinian Authority should dismiss its current complaints at the International Criminal Court against Israel and refrain itself from taking further actions. It should also crack down on “terrorist” groups such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad. Mr. Trump has also proposed $50 billion in investment over 10 years should Palestine accept the proposals. In the final settlement, Palestine would get control over more land than what it currently controls (According to the Oslo Accords, the West Bank was divided into three areas and only one of them is under the direct control of the Palestinian Authority). The plan proposes some land swap for the Israeli annexation of the West Bank Jewish settlements. It seeks to enlarge Gaza and connect the strip with the West Bank through a tunnel. The Arab towns in the southeast of Israel, which are close to Gaza, could become part of a future Palestinian state.

Will it work?

The Palestine position, which is backed by most of the world powers, is the formation of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state based on the 1967 border (meaning the whole of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip) with East Jerusalem as its capital (including the Old City that houses Haram esh-Sharif, also known as Temple Mount, a holy site for both Muslims and Jews). Issues like the right of return of the Palestinian refugees are to be settled in final negotiations. But Mr. Trump has effectively rejected the Palestinian claims outright and asked them to make more compromises. He seeks to give Jerusalem and about 30% of the West Bank to the Israelis and has denied the right of return of the Palestinian refugees — all for truncated sovereignty for the Palestinians in a state that would practically be surrounded by Israel. And for this, the Palestinians should take action against militant groups, stop supporting Palestinian families of those jailed or killed by Israel and refrain itself from questioning the occupation in international fora.

The Fatah party of President Mahmoud Abbas runs the Palestinian Authority on the West Bank, while Hamas is running Gaza. While there’s a bitter feud between these two, both sides, as well as the Islamic Jihad, have come together in rejecting the Trump plan. It would be difficult for any Palestinian leader to sell Mr. Trump’s proposals to a people who are living under occupation for decades. Unsurprisingly, they had rejected the proposal even before Mr. Trump unveiled it. The Palestinians say the Trump administration, which recognised the disputed Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and supported the annexation of the settlements on the West Bank, cannot be an impartial mediator for peace. The Trump plan seems to be underscoring this argument.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/db7nhe/article30682067.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANSPLAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-trumps-israel-palestine-peace-plan/article30682068.ece
20,2020/01/29,UAE announces first case of new coronavirus,"The United Arab Emirates announced on Wednesday its first case of the new coronavirus, in a family from Wuhan, in what is thought to be the first confirmed case in the Middle East.

“The UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention announced a case of the new coronavirus affecting people from one family coming from the city of Wuhan in China,” the State news agency WAM reported, without saying how many were infected.

“The health condition of those affected was stable and under medical monitoring,” it cited the ministry as saying.

Gulf airports, including Dubai which is home to one of the world's biggest aviation hubs, said last week they would screen all passengers arriving from China amid the outbreak of the deadly virus.

The disease has spread to more than 15 countries since it emerged out of Wuhan late last year, with the death toll soaring to 132 and confirmed infections nearing 6,000.

All confirmed fatalities have so far been in China. Confirmed cases have been reported across the Asia Pacific region and in North America and Europe, but the Wuhan family in the UAE appear to be the first in the Middle East.

Dubai's government said on Thursday that some 989,000 Chinese tourists visited the glitzy emirate last year -- a number expected to cross the one million mark in 2020.

About 3.6 million Chinese transited through the emirate's main airport in 2019.

The UAE's Abu Dhabi International Airport, another major hub, has also begun screening passengers arriving from China.

Between them, the two Emirati hubs operate dozens of flights a week with Chinese cities.

China is the UAE's top trading partner and Abu Dhabi is among the 15 top crude oil suppliers to Beijing. Several hundred Chinese companies have offices in the UAE.

The coronavirus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

Like SARS, it can be passed among humans via the respiratory tract.

The UAE health ministry said it has taken “all the necessary precautions” in line with standards approved by the World Health Organisation.

It said that the country's health system “works very efficiently and that the ministry is closely following the situation in a way that guarantees the health and safety of everyone.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ncr6c6/article30681945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHMEXICO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uae-announces-first-case-of-new-coronavirus/article30681946.ece
21,2020/01/29,"Coronavirus | Japan, U.S. evacuate their citizens from Wuhan; death toll hits 133","Hundreds of Americans and Japanese escaped the quarantined Chinese city at the centre of a viral epidemic aboard charter flights on January 29, as the death toll soared to 133 and confirmed infections neared 6,000.

The scale of the deepening crisis was emphasised with the new infection number on the Chinese mainland exceeding that of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002-03. SARS, another respiratory virus transmitted between people, went on to claim nearly 800 lives around the world, with most of those fatalities in mainland China and Hong Kong.

The new virus has spread to more than 15 countries since it emerged out of Wuhan late last year, although all the confirmed fatalities have so far been in China.

Authorities last week imposed transport bans in and around Wuhan in an unprecedented quarantine effort, leaving more than 50 million people effectively trapped.

Also Read China coronavirus: WHO chief calls new emergency talks

China has taken other extraordinary measures to try and stop the disease spreading, including bans on tour groups travelling overseas, suspending schools and extending the Lunar New Year holiday.

With global concerns mounting, the United States, Britain and various other countries have also advised their citizens against travelling to China.

Escape

Thousands of foreigners have been among those trapped in Wuhan, which has become a near ghost-town with car travel banned and residents staying indoors.

Countries have for days been scrambling to try and get their citizens out of Wuhan safely, but have faced huge logistical, medical and bureaucratic hurdles.

Japan and the United States on January 29 were the first to evacuate some of their citizens from Wuhan. About 200 people were aboard the Japanese flight, which landed in Tokyo on Wednesday morning. Medical professionals were on the flight to carry out health checks but Japan's health ministry said there were no plans to quarantine the passengers.

They would instead be asked to remain at home and avoid crowds at least until the results of the test were known. A U.S. charter flight also left Wuhan on Wednesday with about 200 Americans on board, including employees from the local US consulate.

""These travellers will be carefully screened and monitored to protect their health, as well as the health and safety of their fellow Americans,"" a State Department spokeswoman said.

The European Union will fly its citizens out aboard two French planes this week, and South Korea is due to do the same. Several other countries were assessing their options.

More deaths

Meanwhile, the virus continued to spread in China. Authorities said Wednesday the number of cases in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus of which Wuhan is the capital, soared by over 800 from the previous day. The number of confirmed cases across the country climbed to 5,974, while the death toll nationwide jumped 26 to 132.

All of those new reported deaths were in Hubei except for one, on a province just to the north.

The virus is believed to have originated in a wild-animal market in Wuhan, where it jumped to humans before spreading across the country as the peak-travel period for Lunar New Year holiday festivities got underway. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday branded the virus a ""demon"", as he held talks with World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

Following the Xi-Tedros talks, the WHO said the two sides had agreed to send international experts to China ""as soon as possible... to guide global response efforts"". ""Stopping the spread of this virus both in China and globally is WHO's highest priority,"" Tedros said.

Until Tuesday, all reported cases in more than a dozen countries had involved people who had been in or around Wuhan. But Japan and Germany then reported the first confirmed human-to-human transmission of the illness outside China. Vietnam is investigating another case. Germany now has four confirmed cases, all of them employees at a Bavarian firm recently visited by a Chinese colleague, health officials said.

Some experts have praised Beijing for being more reactive and open about the new virus compared to its handling of the SARS epidemic of 2002-2003. But others say local officials had earlier been more focused on projecting stability than responding to the outbreak when it began to spread earlier this month.

The United States asked China on Tuesday to step up its cooperation with international health authorities over the epidemic. ""We are urging China — more cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters.

He added that the United States has offered China assistance three times so far without success.

Separately, U.S. health authorities said they were working on a vaccine, but that it would take months to develop.

The epicenter of the quake was in the sea between Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cuba, at a shallow depth of 10 km. The International Tsunami Information Center said an earlier threat of a tsunami wave had largely passed. Minor sea level fluctuations up to 30 cm were still possible, it said.

In Miami, Florida, several buildings downtown had groups of people standing outside who said they had been evacuated. The Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue department said it responded to multiple calls about high rise buildings swaying.

“As of now, there are no injuries or structural damages. Residents/visitors are advised to stay calm,” the department said on Twitter.

Officials across the region had no initial reports of major damage, despite the size of the quake.

Angie Watler, a spokeswoman for police on Cayman Brac, the island nearest the epicenter of the quake, said members of the public had reported some damage to buildings and to a swimming pool at the Carib Sands resort on the south of the island. Videos on social media, apparently from Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, showed water sloshing out of pools during the quake. Watler said there were no reports so far of injuries but that authorities were still making checks on the area.

A Cayman Islands official said there had been some reports of sinkholes following the quake.

The quake was also felt in several provinces across Cuba, the government said.

23,2020/01/29,"CAA, NRC raised during Congressional hearing on global human rights","The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register for Citizens (NRC) found mention again in a hearing at the U.S. House of Representatives, which heard witnesses testify on religious persecution across the world. The hearing was organised by the Foreign Affairs Committee’s Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights Subcommittee and the Oversight and Reform Committee’s Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Subcommittee.

The hearing dealt with experiences in a range of countries and topics including Nigeria, Uganda, Egypt, Pakistan, China, Bangladesh and the United States. India was also specifically mentioned. Four witnesses were heard: Rachel Deitch of the American Humanist Association, Francisco Bencosme of Amnesty International, Rushan Abbas of the Campaign for Uyghurs and Jeremy Barker of the Religious Freedom Institute.

“The country this past year tops the world in the number of internet shutdowns,” Mr. Bencosme, who specialises on advocacy in the Asia Pacific region, told lawmakers about India.

Lawmakers heard from Mr. Bencosme that the CAA was “completely oblivious to the nature and scale of persecution faced by minorities”. On the NRC, he said the process “stands to create the biggest statelessness crisis in the world, causing immense human suffering.”

Mr. Bencosme also mentioned raids against Amnesty India and said state-friendly media had been “weaponised” against Amnesty India to portray the organisation as having violated India’s sovereignty and as posing a threat to the country.

There was an extensive discussion on the treatment of Uyghurs by the Chinese government including the incarceration of Uyghurs in detention camps, referred to by some at the hearing as ‘concentration camps’.

Blasphemy laws

Lawmakers used the hearing to bring attention to H.R 512, a resolution to repeal blasphemy, heresy and apostasy laws globally.

On Pakistan, Mr. Bencosme said, “In September, Nathu Lal, a school principal … was charged with blasphemy after a mob riled up by a religious order leader leader vandalised a local Hindu temple and attacked properties owned by the Hindu community. The blasphemy laws create an environment in which some people, including complainants and their supporters believe themselves entitled to take the law into their own hands with violent mobs attacking the accused while the police stand aside.”

U.S. visa policies

Representative Karen Bass, who chairs the Subcommittee on Global Human Rights, asked a question on how the U.S.’s own policies, such as recent visa policies which are seen as biased against Muslim countries, as well as the current general environment, impact the U.S.’s ability to address issues in other countries.“You can’t sell abroad, what you’ve lost at home,” Mr. Barker said.

24,2020/01/29,Coronavirus | Airlines cut China flights as companies restrict travel on virus fears,"Airlines including United Airlines Holdings Inc said they were canceling some flights to China as demand fell sharply and global companies told their employees not to travel on deepening fears over the spread of a flu-like virus.

The coronavirus that originated in the city of Wuhan has killed 106 people in China and spread across the world, rattling financial markets.

The United States warned that Americans should reconsider visiting China, while Britain advised against all but essential travel to mainland China. South Korea also advised its citizens to stay away.

Facebook Inc became the first major U.S. company to announce a travel suspension after the U.S. government's warning, saying it had asked employees to halt non-essential travel to mainland China and to work from home if they had traveled there.

Chicago-based United said it was suspending 24 U.S. flights to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai between February 1 and February 8 due to a significant drop in demand.

Europe's biggest bank, HSBC Holdings PLC, banned all staff travel to Chinese-ruled Hong Kong for two weeks and to mainland China until further notice, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

The British-based lender, which has the largest presence among foreign banks in China, also asked staff who have recently visited the country to undergo a self-imposed 14-day quarantine. The virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days.

U.S. rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc imposed similar measures, according to a memo seen by Reuters.

In South Korea, home appliances maker LG Electronics Inc put a complete ban on travel to China and has advised employees on business trips in the country to return home as quickly as possible, a company spokeswoman said.

South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc said it was urging employees to avoid all non-essential travel to China, while banking group Standard Chartered PLC restricted travel to both mainland China and Hong Kong.

In Germany, auto supplier Webasto, which has 11 sites in China, including in Wuhan, has halted all corporate travel to and from China after an employee was infected.

Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd said it recommended employees avoid travel to China, while Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it plans to evacuate its Japanese staff and their families in Wuhan via a government-chartered flight.

Falling travel demand

Aside from United, other airlines said they were adjusting schedules as companies reassessed the risk of travel to China.

South Korean budget carrier Air Seoul said it will halt all flights to China, while Taiwan's China Airlines Ltd rescheduled and canceled some flights to China to February 10.

Taiwan's Eva Airways Corp also said some flights to China may be canceled.

Air Canada said it was cancelling some of its 33 weekly flights to China, and Germany's Lufthansa pointed to subdued bookings to and from the country.

Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it would be progressively reducing capacity to and from mainland China by 50% or more from January 30 to the end of March, in line with a government directive as well as market demand.

International SOS, a medical and travel security services firm that advises companies on travel, said its guidance for now was that business travel to China outside Wuhan's province of Hubei could continue.

26,2020/01/29,"Earthquake of 7.7 magnitude hits Caribbean coast, triggering evacuations","A major 7.7 magnitude quake struck Tuesday in the Caribbean between Jamaica and Cuba, triggering a brief tsunami alert and sending hundreds of people pouring onto the streets of Havana.

The tremors were felt as far as the U.S. mainland as police in Miami evacuated some buildings as a precaution. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake hit at a depth of 10 km, at 1910 GMT — 125 km northwest of Lucea, Jamaica.

It was estimated there was a low likelihood of casualties or damage, and there were no immediate reports of either. The U.S. Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre initially warned there was a threat of tsunami waves reaching 0.3 to 1 m (about 1 to 3 ft) above tide level for the coasts of Jamaica, Belize, Cuba, Honduras, Mexico and the Cayman Islands. But it lifted the alert update about two hours later.

The quake rattled several tall buildings in the Cuban capital Havana, which were immediately evacuated. The earthquake was felt in several provinces including Guantanamo and Santiago de Cuba in the east, Cienfuegos in the center and Havana in the northwest, the official Cuba debate website reported.

But there were no preliminary reports of damage or injuries, however. Jawara Rawjers, a resident of Kingston, Jamaica, told AFP: “I felt the house trembling and realized that it was a quake. It lasted about 20 seconds. I checked my watch and it was 2:12 p.m. I checked on my family but they didn’t feel anything in their part of the house.”

Machel Emanuel, a doctor in the same city, added: “I was on the second floor of a building and there was a sustained shaking of the building. I felt dizzy. The door was slamming consistently for a while.”

Many Jamaicans took to social media in the immediate aftermath to post pictures, unverified by AFP, of swimming pools shaking violently.

28,2020/01/29,"Coronavirus: U.S. in the process of developing vaccine, say officials","The United States said Tuesday it was developing a vaccine against a deadly virus that originated in China, and urged Beijing to step up its cooperation with international health authorities.

The U.S. government is keen to place its own teams on the ground to review the raw data and learn more about the pathogen, which has so far claimed more than 100 lives. “We have already started at the NIH and with many of our collaborators on the development of a vaccine,” National Institutes for Health (NIH) official Anthony Fauci told reporters.

The process would take three months to start the first trial, three more months to gather data, before being able to move into its second phase. “But we are proceeding as if we will have to deploy a vaccine,” said Mr. Fauci.

‘Worst case scenario in mind’

“In other words, we’re looking at the worst scenario that this becomes a bigger outbreak,” he added. China was severely criticized for its handling of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2002-03, which claimed hundreds of lives, mostly on the mainland and in Hong Kong.

During the health emergency, scientists had begun to develop a vaccine, but it was never deployed, Mr. Fauci said. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the United States has offered China assistance three times in dealing with the crisis — so far without success.

“We are urging China — more cooperation and transparency are the most important steps you can take toward a more effective response,” Mr. Azar told reporters. “On January the sixth, we offered to send a CDC team to China that could assist with these public health efforts,” he said.

“I reiterated that offer when I spoke to China’s Minister of Health on Monday, and it was reiterated again via the World Health Organization’s leadership today in Beijing,” Mr. Azar explained.

Enough cooperation?

China was quick to sequence the genome of the 2019 novel Coronavirus and make it public, allowing scientists around the world to develop diagnostic tools and winning praise for its efforts, including from U.S. President Donald Trump.

Just four days ago, Mr. Trump tweeted: “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency.”

But the new revelation by Mr. Azar raises questions about how much China has truly cooperated. “CDC experts are standing by ready, willing and able to go immediately to China, either on a bilateral basis or under the auspices of the World Health Organization,” Mr. Azar said.

This would be necessary so that “we can see raw data, raw evidence and help design the types of studies and analytics” to answer critical questions such as incubation period and whether the infection can be transmitted while patients don’t have symptoms.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/7y6mql/article30678118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/000875S4jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-us-in-the-process-of-developing-vaccine-say-officials/article30678117.ece
29,2020/01/29,‘Off-Facebook Activity’ to let users protect browsing history,"To give over two billion users more control over their privacy, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced several new features, including an ‘Off-Facebook Activity’ tool that will let users disconnect their identities from browsing history so Facebook won’t be able to see which websites they visit.

The ‘Off-Facebook Activity’ tool is now available to people on Facebook around the world.

“Other businesses send us information about your activity on their sites and we use that information to show you ads that are relevant to you. Now you can see a summary of that information and clear it from your account if you want to,” Zuckerberg said in a statement on Tuesday.

“Off-Facebook Activity marks a new level of transparency and control,” he added.

Over the next few weeks, Facebook will show nearly two billion people a prompt, encouraging them to review their privacy settings.

“The prompt will show up in your News Feed and direct you to the Privacy Checkup tool, which we recently updated,” said Zuckerberg.

“This makes it even easier to adjust who can see your posts and profile information, strengthen your account security by turning on login alerts, and review the information you share with apps you’ve logged in with Facebook.”

The social networking giant also introduced alerts for third-party logins.

Facebook Login lets users sign in to other apps and services, like games and streaming platforms, using the Facebook account.

“To help you keep track of your activity, we rolled out Login Notifications earlier this month. These notifications alert you when you use Facebook Login to sign in to third-party apps to help you stay aware of how your account is being used and edit your settings,” said Zuckerberg, adding that one of his main goals is to build much stronger privacy protections for everyone on Facebook.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/19bjki/article30683918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29NETFACEBOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/off-facebook-activity-to-let-users-protect-browsing-history/article30683919.ece
30,2020/01/29,Google grants $1mn for promoting news literacy in India,"Google on Wednesday announced a $1 million grant for global non-proft organisation Internews that will launch a new initiative to promote news literacy among the Indian public.

The funding is part of Google.org’s broader, $10 million commitment to media literacy, in collaboration with the Google News Initiative (GNI), the company said in a statement.

Internews will select a team of 250 journalists, fact checkers, academics and NGO workers, who will be trained on a curriculum developed by global and Indian experts, adapted to local needs and available in seven Indian languages.

The local leaders will then roll out the training to new internet users in non-metro cities in India, enabling them to better navigate the Internet and assess the information they find.

In partnership with third-party organisations like DataLeads and Internews, the GNI has so far provided in-depth verification training for more than 15,000 journalists and students from more than 875 news organisations, in 10 Indian languages.

Google last year trained journalists in online verification and fact-checking, digital safety and security, YouTube for elections coverage and data visualization for the general elections.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/v3uh9x/article30683716.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29NETGOOGLEGRANT,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/google-grants-1mn-for-promoting-news-literacy-in-india/article30683717.ece
31,2020/01/29,"With music, art and film conversations, CUSP comes to Chennai","Picture this: an intimate concert entertaining a small group of rasikas in the pristine patio of a 250-year-old Dutch heritage structure: Luz House in Mylapore. The glitz and glamour that has now come to be associated with classical arts performances, takes a backseat in this setting. In fact, it paves the way for an audience to engage with artistes and their craft. CUSP, a three-day, multi-artform festival, aims to do precisely that: create a dialogue led by practitioners, albeit in a relatable manner.

CUSP focusses on work that is experimental, relatively young, yet exceptional. That goes beyond the conventional milieu of classical arts. Organised by Mumbai-based First Edition Arts, it will feature over 50 musicians, speakers and performers from all over India, led by a strong curatorial team of artistes.

Devina Dutt of First Edition Arts, also part of the curatorial team speaks of festival’s inception: “I am a rasika myself. But lately, as an art critic and writer, I have had concerns about how concerts of classical arts are being presented.” Big logos, large screens, unnecessary lighting — all amount to glamour, which takes away from the patrons’ experience, adds Devina. This concern is what that led to CUSP.

Though the scale of the festival is large, the experience it seeks to give is different from what is usually doled out in the city. An intimate setting with mood lighting, and an effort to respect artistes’ space, form major components in enhancing the experience. Though music forms the crux, conversations around performing arts and their role in the society, film screenings, a spot of theatre and visual arts exhibitions, are also on the line-up.

Both Carnatic and Hindustani music will be explored through concerts and discussions. For instance, a workshop titled Aesthetics, Sound and Music, will feature philosopher and author Sundar Sarukkai on the philosophy of music, interacting with musicians. Ganesh Devy will explore the links between music, literature and protest in India, while Tamil writer Imayam reads from his works and AR Venkatachalapathy leads a discussion on an artist’s response to the idea of India today. A Carnatic concert, a tribute to Veena Dhanammal and a performance by Carnatic Quartet are among many lined up. Another notable performance will be that of Nandanar Charithiram, a villupaatu and Carnatic ensemble that will narrate the story of Thirunalaipovar. Hindustani too takes the fore with a dialogue between Hindustani music practitioners Warren Senders, Sumitra Ranganathan and Ranjani Ramachandran, interspersed with live music. Night Sky: Hindustani Vocal Concert by Priya Purushothaman will fleature ate-night ragas, with Tejovrush Joshi on the tabla and Vyasmurti Katti on the harmonium.

In the theatre front is RIP, Restlessness in Pieces, an interactive solo performance by Savita Rani. A set of films on the performing arts of South India, curated by film critic CS Venkiteswaran, will run in loop.

Led by visual artist and curator C Krishnapriya, 17 young artists from the city (some of them still students) will also present more than 25 works, spanning across media, exploring the self, the body and other process-based work. While Savita Narasimhan, vocalist and curator, will present rare photographs of T Balasaraswati from over five decades, Bindu Art School will also be exhibiting its work.

CUSP will be held from January 31 to February 2. E-mail thecuspfestival.fea@gmail.com or call 7338733190.

32,2020/01/29,How Food4Thought rekindles the joy of reading,"An installation shaped like a house, built with books, was one of the many attractions at the Hyderabad Literary Festival (HLF). There were smaller boxes of books placed near the installation, labelled Ghar Ghar Pustakalaya (GGP). It’s the new initiative of the Food4Thought Foundation. “I think GGP is necessary to boost our country’s GDP (Gross Domestic Product),” says Shefali Rao, one of the founders of the organisation.

Beyond the word play, GGP is an attempt to make books available in places where it’s tough to set up a conventional library. “Not everyone can maintain a library and catalogue the books. It involves time, effort and money. GGP is an alternative method to take books to remote hamlets and slums. Each box contains about 50 books, and once these have been read, we issue a new set of books,” she explains.

Established in 2015, Food4Thought is now spread across 22 States and 81 cities. The organisation has helped set up more than 300 libraries in schools, hospitals, homes and even prisons.

Read and win

The organisation came about when Shefali had a collection of books that she had outgrown and wanted to donate. These were treasured volumes and she was eager to know who would benefit from it. “I discussed it with my husband [K Srinivas Rao] and he said it was time to do something on our own,” she shares. The couple runs an HR consultancy firm called The Strategist and had been wanting to do something pertaining to social responsibility. They registered Food4Thought as a voluntary organisation.

The first generous contributions came from within their family circles. “They were generous enough to forego the money they had allocated for vacations and birthday gifts,” says Srinivas.

Food4Thought recently approached a few corporate houses to see if they would be keen to help set up libraries as part of their corporate social responsibility activities. “It’s still in the early stages,” Srinivas says.

Meanwhile, individuals came forward and donated books. Books received are catalogued and circulated to readers, and the donors can track where their books are travelling.

“When we began, we wanted to take books to the farthest of places and explored the north eastern states. It was easier said than done,” recalls Shefali. Courier companies wouldn’t go beyond the major cities of the northeastern belt and hired porters/couriers would have to carry the books on their backs for a few kilometres. But this is where heartwarming stories also came to the fore: “One of the courier agents told us that he’s willing to do two trips for free when he heard about the work we do,” says Shefali.

The organisation networked with Art of Living which had branches in remote parts of the country and made books available through them.

Srinivas talks about the two-fold approach of the organisation — to donate books to the remote rural parts of the country, and to rekindle the urge to read among urban children. “We say no to text books and religious volumes. The idea is to encourage reading habits not linked to academics,” he says. In urban schools, members of the foundation occasionally play two or three-minute podcasts from their Save Endangered Stories (on YouTube) series that highlight oral tales that used to be narrated by grandparents. “Children get interested and want to know more, and the teacher directs them to related books in the library,” adds Srinivas.

The foundation gets language books from National Book Trust periodically and from private organisations like Green Gold Animation which gives away hundreds of Chhota Bheem books. “When these books arrive, we have our hands full. In addition to five full-time volunteers, everyone at The Strategist helps in cataloguing the volumes and there’s a lot of joy in doing this. We are in this for good,” Shefali says with a smile.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ljmoef/article30683759.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HLF-2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/spread-across-22-states-and-81-cities-hyderabad-based-food4thought-foundation-rekindles-the-joy-of-reading/article30683764.ece

ENICL is part of the Inter State Transmission Scheme (ISTS) network and consists of two 400 KV transmission lines with a total of about 900 circuit km across Assam, Bihar and West Bengal.

This acquisition would increase the assets under management of IndiGrid by 10% to ₹12,100 crore.

It is a strategic asset which is crucial for power exchange across the north-eastern and eastern regions of India. IndiGrid had signed an extension of Right of First Offer deed with Sterlite Power for ENICL as disclosed in the Offer Document dated May 04, 2019.

IndiGrid is leveraged at 45% net debt-to-AUM ratio. Post the acquisition, IndiGrid’s net debt-AUM ratio will continue to be below 49%. This acquisition will be funded by internal accruals, proceeds from the preference issue done in May 2019 and new debt. The acquisition is expected to close by March 2020.

IndiGrid’s portfolio will increase to nine power transmission projects with a total network of 20 power transmission lines that span more than 5,800 circuit km across 13 Indian States, post this acquisition.

42,2020/01/29,Lamborghini eyes continued double-digit sales growth in India,"Italian carmaker Lamborghini is looking to continue double-digit sales growth in the Indian market on the back of improving consumer sentiment amid expectations that the upcoming Budget will bring in more positivity.

“We operate in super-luxury space [cars priced at over 2.5 crore]. 2019 was a tough year, there was a decline in the overall passenger vehicle industry. The super luxury industry also declined by 16-17% last year,” Sharad Agarwal, head of Lamborghini India, told The Hindu. He, however, said that Lamborghini was able to buck the trend, selling 52 units in 2019, growing from 45 units in 2018, or at 15.5%.

The overall super-luxury car market declined from about 315 units in 2018 to about 265 units in 2019 in India.

The company, which launched the Huracan EVO Rear-Wheel Drive on Wednesday with a price tag of ₹3.22 crore (ex-showroom), aims to continue the growth momentum and is “definitely looking at a double-digit growth” this calendar.

He added that when sentiments are bad, people postpone their purchases. “This happens with everybody, it is not that when sentiment is bad, our income levels are changing. But if you look, spending pattern changes. [In] 2020, we are seeing more conversation with customers. We anticipate things to improve in the coming months and the Budget will bring in more positivity,” he said.

Talking about sales trends, Mr. Agarwal said currently, the company gets more that half of its sale from south India and about 25% of the overall business is from tier 1 and tier 2 cities.

Asked if taxation was the only challenge for the super-luxury segment, he replied in the negative. “I think consistency of government policy is a challenge. If you keep changing price points every few months, that becomes a challenge. Second is infrastructure and third is the perception of looking at wealth creators in this country. People who have created wealth, they are successful, they are running large enterprise, creating jobs and adding to the GDP, but when they buy super luxury cars, the perception is still not right.”

Asked about the outlook for a three-five year period, Mr. Agarwal said, “It is very difficult to predict in a scenario like India. I will say that given that we are over 1.2 billion people, we are adding second largest number of billionaires every year and the Indian economy is projected to grow. There are some corrections here and there, but long-term outlook for India remains strong. That is why we are investing in India as a market.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/srrrlv/article30686458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THBULAMBORGINI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lamborghini-eyes-continued-double-digit-sales-growth-in-india/article30686459.ece
43,2020/01/29,SBI partial relief against IRDAI order,"SBI Life Insurance Company has managed to get a partial relief from the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) that has set aside an order by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), which directed the insurance company to disgorge ₹275 crore for alleged excess commission earned.

The tribunal has ruled that the IRDAI did not correctly calculate the disgorgement amount and hence directed the insurance regulator to recalculate and recover the unlawful gains.

“We are of the opinion that the amount of ₹275 crore has wrongly been calculated by the respondent (IRDAI). The matter is remitted to the IRDAI to recalculate the unlawful gain, namely, the interest earned on advance premium collected and recover the same accordingly and pay it to the policyholders,” the SAT order stated.

The insurance regulator had issued a show-cause notice to SBI Life Insurance alleging that the company earned excess commission totalling ₹275.30 crore during the the financial years 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11. Thereafter, IRDAI issued an order in March 2014, directing the insurance company to identify the beneficiaries and distribute the excess commission paid to corporate agents to such beneficiaries and complete the process within six months.

The roots of the matter lie in a product named ‘Dhanraksha Plus’ that was launched in three formats by SBI Life Insurance. The format that led to the IRDAI order was Dhanraksha Plus – Limited Premium Paying Term, which was a two-year limited premium paying group term product.

SAT, in its order, stated that IRDAI arrived at the quantum of disgorgement on the premise that it covered the excess commission — the difference between the premium collected under the LPPT policy versus the premium that could be collected after it were sold as an single premium policy — collected by the insurance company.

Under the LPPT plan, SBI Life Insurance company collected the second-year premium in advance and earned interest on it, which, as per SAT, was ‘illegally earned.’",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sbi-partial-relief-against-irdai-order/article30686441.ece

45,2020/01/29,IRDAI imposes ₹1 cr. penalty on 2 insurers,"Insurance regulator IRDAI has imposed a penalty of ₹1 crore each on general insurers ICICI Lombard and Tata AIG. It also imposed a total penalty of ₹2 lakh on Bajaj Allianz, another GIC.

In the case of ICICI Lombard, the regulator held that the insurer had violated the regulation with regard to the maximum allowable policy term for group and individual health products.

In the case of Tata AIG, an on-site inspection of corporate agent Tata Capital Financial Services revealed certain violations of regulations on protection of policyholders’ interests, the IRDAI said.

It also led to the the regulator seeking clarifications from Tata AIG GIC and finding that the general insurer had not complied with certain provisions.

According to the IRDAI order, “the findings of the inspection were that the corporate agent collected renewal premium at the time of issue of a three-year policy issued by the general insurer. To fund this amount of three-year policy premium plus another three-year renewal premium, the corporate agent provided loan to the policyholders and charged interest at 12.25 / 13% p.a. in respect of some policies picked up on sample basis during inspection.”

The regulator said the policyholder ends up paying interest unnecessarily when the corporate agent gives a loan for renewal premium which is payable three years later on. Noting that the general insurer is expected to ensure the consent of the client is obtained for paying advance renewal premium, IRDAI, while imposing the penalty, said the insurer should be extra careful with a corporate agent which also has a lending business which may have potential conflict with the business of an insurance intermediary.

In its order against Bajaj Allianz, IRDAI said the insurer had violated the ‘File and Use’ guidelines by issuing two policies with a product name different from that approved under the ‘File and Use’ procedure. A penalty of ₹1 lakh for lapse noticed in each of the two policies is imposed on the general insurer, IRDAI said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/irdai-imposes-1-cr-penalty-on-2-insurers/article30686415.ece
46,2020/01/29,VC market in India ends 2019 on a high note: report,"Venture Capital (VC) investment in India was quite strong in the fourth quarter of calender year 2019, ending the year on a high note with a number of large, mega-deals, including a $1 billion funding round by Paytm and a $500 million round by business productivity company Udaan.

Consumer-focused technologies were a critical focus for VC investors in India, according to the KPMG report titled “Venture Pulse Q4’2019.’

In addition to Paytm, online pharmacy company PharmEasy raised $220 million, while home furnishings company Urban Ladder raised $148 million during the quarter.

Fintech continued to be one of India’s strongest sectors for VC investment in Q4’19, a trend expected to continue for the foreseeable future given the country’s significant rural and unbanked population and the complexities and challenges associated with building a traditional financial services company in the country, according to the report.

Commenting on the VC investment in India, Nitish Poddar, partner and national leader – private equity, KPMG in India, said, “VC investment in India was relatively mixed during 2019. While VC investment started off soft, the last two quarters have seen a number of excellent deals. This activity is very encouraging and suggests a growing positivity heading into Q1’20. Further, of late, there is a growing interest in the space from Japan’s trading houses, who are betting on the India consumption story.”

Foreign investors remained quite active and interested in making investments in India. During Q4’19, Silicon Valley-based Accel closed funding for a $550 million fund, it’s sixth India-focused VC fund. India has also seen an increase in VC investments by Japan’s trading houses.

Heading into 2020, companies in India looking to attract attention from VC investors are expected to put more emphasis on reducing their cash flow and providing clear paths to profitability. Investors are likely to focus their investments on companies with strong and sustainable growth models.

50,2020/01/29,Honda drives in BSVI-compliant Amaze at ₹6.09 lakh,"Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) on Wednesday rolled out BSVI compliant version of its entry-level compact sedan Amaze priced between ₹6.09 lakh and ₹9.55 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

The 1.2 litre petrol variants of the model are priced between ₹6.09 lakh and ₹8.75 lakh, while the 1.5 litre diesel trims are tagged between ₹7.55 lakh and ₹9.95 lakh (all prices ex-showroom Delhi).

“Honda is committed to bring its latest and advanced environment friendly technologies to the Indian market and we have introduced BSVI version of our largest-selling model Honda Amaze,” HCIL Vice President and Director, Marketing and Sales, Rajesh Goel said in a statement.

The sedan will be the company’s first BSVI diesel model in India, he added.

Honda has applied its advanced exhaust gas after-treatment system with NSC (NOx Storage Catalyst) and DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) to meet the challenging target of particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission in case of diesel engines, Mr. Goel said.

The petrol trims come with BSVI compliant 1.2 litre petrol engine mated with both manual and continuously variable transmissions (CVTs).

The petrol manual trims come with a fuel efficiency of 18.6 km per litre while the CVT variants come with 18.3 km per litre fuel efficiency, HCIL said.

The manual diesel trims are tuned to deliver fuel efficiency of 24.7 km per litre while the CVT variants come with a fuel economy of 21 km per litre, it added.

“From now, we will progressively shift towards BSVI changeover for all our model range by end of this fiscal,” Mr. Goel said when asked about company’s plans to transition its portfolio to comply with stricter emission norms.

He said that the company has already finished despatches of BSIV models by December-end and all the stock in the pipeline, including in the network, is expected to get over by the end of this month.

“There could be few units here and there but it is going to be miniscule,” he said.

Mr. Goel said the company decided to cut production of BS-IV models in September last year when the market was reeling under severe slowdown.

“We decided at a time when the market was in a free fall in September to take this hit in terms of reduction in production and supplies to de-risk the business for ourselves as well as our network to avoid the risk of extremely high discounting and also the risk of leftover stock if any,” he noted.

Goel said the initiative to reduce BSIV production has impacted the company in terms of reduced sales volume in the near future.

“It (production cut) has not come without cost. Because of this our January and February numbers will be significantly lower as compared with last year,” he said.

The company will take another couple of months to start ramping up production, Mr. Goel said.

“In the next fiscal, our intent is to grow as compared to whatever we do this year,” he noted.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/71kers/article30574662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGMHONDA-AMAZE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/honda-drives-in-bsvi-compliant-amaze-at-609-lakh/article30683187.ece
51,2020/01/29,"Gold little changed as investors assess virus impact, await Fed decision","Gold prices were little changed on Wednesday after sliding 1% in the previous session, as investors evaluated the economic impact from the coronavirus outbreak in China, and awaited a policy decision from the U.S. Federal Reserve due later in the day.

Spot gold was almost unchanged at $1,565.67 per ounce by 10:15 IST. U.S. gold futures fell 0.3% to $1,564.60.

The virus has caused panic in the market as it is spreading quickly and there is little known about it. It has claimed 132 lives so far and infected nearly 6,000 in China.

“Any economic impact to China is unquantifiable at the moment. If we're still in this situation in a month from now, we are going to see some growth issues, but at the moment we are just speculating,” said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, OANDA.

If there is an escalation in the crisis, gold prices can breach the $1,600 an ounce level, he added.

Bullion is seen as a safe store of value during times of economic and political turmoil.

Asian shares erased earlier gains as a spike in new cases of the virus sent Hong Kong stocks tumbling on resumption of trade after the Lunar New Year break.

A brief inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve on Tuesday for the first time since October left investors unsettled as it often precedes a recession.

Meanwhile, the dollar held close to a near two-month high hit in the previous session, making gold expensive for holders of other currencies.

Investors are now waiting for the U.S. central bank's monetary policy statement. Analysts and investors widely expect the Fed to stand pat on interest rates.

“The main driver for gold this year will be strategic inflows as it will continue to be viewed as an attractive diversifier for investor portfolios in an environment where rates remain low,” UBS strategist Joni Teves said.

The Fed is expected to make a slight increase on the interest it pays on excess reserves held at the central bank in a move, aimed at lifting the effective federal funds rate, currently near the bottom of its target range.

Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.

Among other precious metals, palladium advanced 0.9% to $2,309.07 an ounce, while platinum rose 0.3% to $988.60.

Silver shed 0.1% to $17.42, having dipped to its lowest since Dec. 23 at $17.35 earlier in the session. ji",business,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/y3kqlu/article30681978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25thpns04YEAR-TH26BUGOLDBARjpjpg-13jan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/gold-little-changed-as-investors-assess-virus-impact-await-fed-decision/article30681979.ece
52,2020/01/29,"You forced us to come to the streets, women tell Yogi Adityanath","Loud chants of ‘CAA ko wapis lo,’ ‘Nari shakti zindabad’ and ‘Awaaz do hum ek hain,’ fill the air at the Hussainabad clock tower, located in the heart of Lucknow’s old city. The park at the foot of the 221-feet high clock tower, the tallest in the country, is packed with people, most of them women, girls and children.

Since January 17, the protesters have been staging a sit-in at the clock tower against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens. Despite the police crackdown, including four FIRs and charges of harassment, the protests have only grown stronger, both in numbers and resolve.

“You forced us [women] to come out to the streets by bringing this law,” said Tabassum Raza, a home maker, referring to the BJP government. After the protests against the CAA turned violent in Lucknow on December 19, police allegedly broke into Ms. Raza’s house in Muftiganj, climbing in through the terrace, and vandalized the property and the cars parked outside. They were searching for the men in the house and allegedly misbehaved with the women and even hit them.

“When we are not safe at home, when police are coming to our homes, misbehaving and hitting us, what will we do,” asked Ms. Raza.

Azadi slogans

Her comments come in the context of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath controversially accusing the Opposition parties of using women as proxies to protest against the CAA.

At a recent rally in Kanpur, Mr. Adityanath claimed that women were told to gather in the streets by the men in their families, while they themselves preferred to “sleep in their quilts” at home. “Ab inhone ne apne ghar ki mahilaon ko chaurahe chaurahe par bithana prarambh kar diya hai (Now they have started to place their women at every crossroads),” Mr. Adityanath had said.

The women protesters condemned the Chief Minister’s remarks and slammed him for underestimating women and reducing their agency.

“On December 19, when our men jumped into the field, what did you do to them? They were dumped inside jails. But now men are protesting along with us,” said Uzma Parveen, another protester. Wearing a hijab, a seven-month old baby straddled to her chest and the tricolour painted on her cheeks and forehead, Ms. Parveen has become one of the most recognizable faces of the Lucknow sit-in.

Ms. Parveen advised Mr. Adityanath to “not consider women weak” and referring to the legacies of Rani Lakshmi Bai and Begum Hazrat Mahal reminded him that leadership and initiative have no gender.

“During the freedom struggle, Rani Lakshmi Bai stood up against the British... she didn't budge,” Ms. Parveen said. “His [Mr. Adityanath’s] comments show what his mentality towards women is. But we consider it our duty to come here daily,” she said.

The protesters also took exception to Mr. Adityanath warning of action against those who chant Azadi (freedom) slogans. He had said it amounted to sedition.

They explained that by Azadi they meant freedom from unemployment, hunger and poverty and not secession from the country. “We are living in a democratic country and we have the right to ask for improvement and jobs. It’s not anti-national,” said Varisha Salim (17), a biology student. Since January 17, Ms. Salim has been spending at least 3-4 hours at the protest site daily after school, only taking breaks for her coaching classes. Like her, a motley crowd of youngsters and the elderly attend the protest daily, between work, study and other daily chores.

Ms. Salim is agitated by reports that members of the ruling BJP accuse women protesters, especially in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh, of being motivated by cash incentives. “If we are being paid to come here, why has the BJP not tried to buy us yet?” said Ms. Salim. “Truth is, we [protesters] are not for sale. We are here to protect our Constitution. It is our duty as citizens of this country. Our Constitution is in danger.”

Huda Khalid, a science student, and the same age as Ms. Salim, is opposed to the CAA-NRC because they “divide” the nation on the basis of religion. “Our government should listen to us. Remove the law or bring in equality for all religions,” suggested Ms. Khalid.

Constitutional right

Among the regulars at the protest site are Tarannum and and her husband Waseem, both wheelchair-bound. Placards in their hands, they speak of the need to raise our voice as a citizen. “Samvidhan Bachana Mera Samvidhanik Adhikar hai (It is my constitutional right to save the Constitution),” reads one of them.

Mr. Waseem feels the NRC and CAA go against the values of the Constitution and hurt the composite culture of the country. There is also an overwhelming feeling among the protesters that the CAA will be followed up by the nationwide NRC.

“If we don’t save the Constitution today, we won’t have any answers for the questions the coming generations ask us,” said Mr. Waseem, when asked what motivates him to attend the protest daily. “Please come out of your homes,” he pleads. “If you don’t come out today, then maybe tomorrow you may have to leave this country.”

Several women protesters, especially those with families and children to take care of, said they had to make adjustments to their daily routine to to find time to come here. “No woman will abandon her house and work and bring her child out in this cold for ₹500, as they are saying,” said Fatima Sahab. She invites Mr. Adityanath to attend the protest and clarify the doubts of the protesters.

Uroosa Rana, daughter of well-known Urdu poet Munawwar Rana, is helping the protesters with food, medicine, water and other emergency supplies, through her volunteers. The protesters are also being guided to use approved slogans to avoid controversies and police harassment. “We are holding the protest in a peaceful manner. We don’t want to give the police any opportunity to take action,” said Ms. Rana.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l0lbrm/article30686715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30PROTESTUP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/you-forced-us-to-come-to-the-streets-women-tell-yogi-adityanath/article30686716.ece
53,2020/01/29,"Government recommends Homoeopathy, Ayurveda to ‘prevent’ coronavirus infection","With the world gripped by the contagion of the novel coronavirus strain from China that has so far claimed at least 130 lives and infected 6,000 people across the world, India’s Ministry of traditional medicine or AYUSH (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy) on Wednesday issued an “advisory” advocating preventive treatment against the viral infection. The note was widely circulated via the official Press Information Bureau.

Also read: All you want to know about China's coronavirus

“Drink Shadang Paniya (Musta, Parpat, Usheer, Chandan,Udeechya & Nagar) processed water (10 gm powder boiled in 1-litre water, until it reduces to half). Store it in a bottle and drink it when thirsty....avoid close contact with people...If you suspect Corona Viral infection, wear a mask and contact your nearest hospital immediately,” reads the Ayurveda section of the advisory that also suggests, “....wearing an N95 mask when travelling or working in public spaces to avoid droplet transmission”.

List of steps

The same advisory also lists a host of preventive steps according to the tenets of Homoeopathy and prescribes “Arsenicum album30” that could be taken as “prophylactic medicine against Coronavirus infections.” The Homoeopathy recommendation came after the AYUSH Ministry had a meeting on Tuesday with the Central Council for Research in Homoeopathy to discuss how Homoeopathy could be used to treat a coronavirus infection.

The Ministry’s advisory also includes a host of Unani therapeutics. “.... SharbatUnnab 10-20ml twice a day, TiryaqArba 3-5g twice a day, TiryaqNazla 5g twice a day...”

The World Health Organisation prescribes no medicine or treatment to deal with a coronavirus infection and recommends generic measures such as using an alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water, avoiding close contact with those with a cough and cold, and avoiding the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products.

‘Ill-advised’

The AYUSH advisory was issued in the morning and widely panned on Twitter.

“This advisory is ill advised. To claim preventive efficacy/symptomatic management without any kind of evidence when not a whole lot is known about the virus,& there is a chance of rumour-mongering and panic, reflects poorly on the AYUSH ministry,” Anant Bhan, a prominent bio-ethicist and health policy analyst tweeted.

The head of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), a leading association of doctors, described the Ayush Ministry advisory as “quackery”. “The strains of coronavirus undergo mutations and changes. How can a generic treatment advisory be given?” Rajan Sharma, President, IMA told The Hindu. “Several of the prescriptions are a part of culture but shouldn’t be given out as treatment advice.”

‘Boost immunity’

Later in the day, the Ayush Ministry modified its advisory but left the recommendations largely untouched. “AYUSH system is based on traditional health practices. The traditional Healthcare system of the country provides lifestyle advocacies to boost immunity which helps the prevention of various kind infectious diseases. Recently, the outbreak of corona virus has been noticed which mainly involve Respiratory system. The Ministry of AYUSH is issuing the advisory as preventive measure and not claiming to be a treatment advice for the Corona virus infection,” it noted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/xq4do5/article30684791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-unani-ayushjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/government-recommends-homoeopathy-ayurveda-to-prevent-coronavirus-infection/article30686644.ece
54,2020/01/29,Islam does not bar women from mosques: All India Muslim Personal Board,"The All India Muslim Personal Board (AIMPLB) clarified to the Supreme Court on Wednesday that Islamic doctrine, tenets and beliefs do not prohibit Muslim women from entering mosques to offer prayer.

The counter affidavit filed by the Board, a 47-year-old expert body which works to protect the Muslim personal law, is in response to a PIL plea filed by Yasmeen Zuber Ahamed Peerzade in 2018, challenging the prohibition on Muslim women from entering mosques to offer namaz (prayer) as unconstitutional and an affront to their right to life, equality and dignity.

“Considering the religious texts, doctrine and religious belief of the followers of Islam, it is submitted that entry of women in the mosque for offering prayer/namaz, inside the mosque, is permitted. Thus, a Muslim woman is free to enter masjid for prayers. It is her option to exercise her right to avail such facilities as available for prayers in masjid,” AIMPLB, represented by advocate M.R. Shamshad, countered.

Islam has not made it obligatory on Muslim women to join congregational prayer nor is it obligatory for them to offer Friday namaz in congregation though it is for Muslim men, the Board explained by quoting from the Hadiths (record of the traditions and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad).

“The Muslim woman is differently placed. As per doctrines of Islam, she is entitled to the same religious reward (sawab) for praying as per her option either in masjid or at home,” AIMPLB said.

But the Board added that it has no State powers and issues only advisory opinions based on Islam as a body of experts.

The practices of religion on the places of worship (which in the present matter are masjids) are purely private bodies regulated by muttawalis of the mosques, the affidavit said.

The Board however discouraged the apex court from entering into an arena of “detailed arrangements of a religious place, which is completely privately managed entity for religious practices of believers in particular religion”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/37h82o/article30686476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30TH-PRAYER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/islam-does-not-bar-women-from-mosques-says-board/article30686477.ece
55,2020/01/29,DGCA backs action by airlines against Kunal Kamra,"A day after Indian carriers barred stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra from flying, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said the action taken by airlines was in complete consonance with Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR) Section-3, Series M Part VI on handling of unruly passengers.

Internal committee

Reacting to a news website report that the flying ban was a clear violation of rules, the aviation regulator said the matter was now to be referred to the internal committee as prescribed in para 6.1 of the said CAR.

Also read: SpiceJet, GoAir also refuse to fly stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra

Action against Mr. Kamra from other airlines came after he tweeted a video showing him accosting television journalist Arnab Goswami, and Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Singh Puri advised them (other airlines) to impose restrictions similar to what IndiGo had imposed on the stand-up comedian.

“Further, as per para 6.4 of the CAR, the internal committee is to give the final decision in 30 days by giving the reasons in writing, which shall be binding on the airline concerned. Punishment for different type of unruly behaviour is also prescribed in the same CAR and the internal committee has to adhere to the same,” the DGCA said.

Mr. Kamra and Mr. Goswami meanwhile ended up on the same flight once again on Wednesday, while flying back from Lucknow to Mumbai. Mr. Kamra was barred by the airline from flying after the aircraft landed in Mumbai. Barring Vistara and Air Asia, the rest — SpiceJet, Air India and GoAir — have barred Mr. Kamra from flying.

The three-month ban imposed by IndiGo, after Mr. Kamra allegedly heckled journalist Arnab Goswami on its flight, came within six hours of the incident. But rules of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation stipulate that the airline must have a three-member internal committee headed by a former judge to investigate such an incident within 30 days. An airline can ban a passenger in the interim, but that ban can’t be for more than 30 days.

Arbitrary ban

Many have questioned the arbitrariness in the way SpiceJet, Air India and GoAir followed suit and imposed a ban “until further notice”.

The rules state very clearly that a person can be placed on a “no-fly list” by an airline after it concludes an internal inquiry. It is only after that can other airlines exercise their “option” to ban the passenger. But in this particular case, airlines did not wait for IndiGo to conclude its inquiry.

IndiGo has not responded to queries from The Hindu on who the complainant was, the inquiry process and the grounds for the ban.

The rules provide for a three-tier ban — three months’ ban for verbal assault or gestures, a six-month ban for physical assault or sexual harassment and a ban of at least two years for life-threatening behaviour. The six-month ban, therefore, contravenes the rules as the video shows that there was no manhandling.

It is important here to stress that airlines are extremely cautious in imposing flying restrictions on passengers. This is the reason the only person to be placed on a no-fly list maintained by the DGCA so far is Birju Kumar Salla, a Mumbai-based businessman who scribbled a hoax bomb threat aboard a Jet Airways aircraft which forced the airline to divert the plane to an airport en route at Ahmedabad.

Though the Civil Aviation Ministry recommended that the individual be placed on a no-fly order, the airline took several days to comply with it.

Though Mr. Kamra can approach an appellate committee headed by a former High Court judge against his ban within 60 days, the question is that if it is the Ministry that constitutes such a body, can there be an independent inquiry.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lir6l9/article30686420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30TH-INDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-flying-ban-on-kunal-kamra-probe-must-to-slap-three-month-flying-ban/article30686421.ece
57,2020/01/29,Researcher finds email accounts of top government officials ‘compromised’,"An independent security researcher has alerted the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre, Government of India, that the credentials of the official email accounts of at least 3,000 employees working in sensitive establishments such as the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR), Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) among others have been hacked in various data breaches.

Sai Krishna Kothapalli, Founder, Hackrew, did an analysis of data leaks from several services spanning the last six years and compiled a dossier of the leaked credentials from various websites in the “dark web” among other resources. This data was highly disorganised initially, as it came from several sources over a long period and each data breach gave results in different formats.

Shocking results

The results of Mr. Kothapalli’s analysis revealed that 3,202 accounts ending with “gov.in” format were hacked and their login name/passwords made available in plain text over the deep web. “The findings came as a rude shock. I had never expected such a large-scale attack which could possibly be targeted towards some specific organisations. For example, IGCAR, with 365 employee email credentials leaked, is on the top. It is closely followed by BARC, with 325 accounts. What blows my mind is that the two top organisations that deal with atomic research top this list. There is no logical explanation to this other than the possibility that these organisations were specifically targeted, which is why the count of leaked data is so high compared to other organisations,” Mr. Kothapalli told The Hindu on Monday.

Before the analysis, he said, a thorough clean-up had to be performed to separate the email IDs and passwords and arrange them in a format legible enough to carry out a detailed analysis. The data was checked against a third party called “Have I been pwned” - a website that allows internet users to check whether their personal data has been compromised by data breaches. The Hindu independently checked some of the email ids of employees (including scientists) belonging to the aforementioned organisations and provided by Mr. Kothapalli, in the website, and found that they had indeed been compromised in data breaches.

A Computer Science and Engineering graduate from IIT-Guwahati, Mr. Kothapalli has a start-up that is working towards making Indian cyberspace more secure. “I tried to make some correlation as to why atomic research organisations were leaked more. My analysis revealed that several of these accounts were not part of any data breach. This leaves only one conclusion – they must have been victims of a targeted phishing campaign,” he said.

The results of Mr. Kothapalli’s research show that 85% (out of a total of 1.85 billion) of the passwords were in plain text. Out of these, the ones belonging to government employees were all in plain text, without exception. This means that these emails have not only been compromised, but the respective passwords have been made available in plain text in various leaked databases across the dark web. In layman’s terms, this implies that if the employees use those same email ID-password combination for any other web-based services, then there is a high probability that all those services will also be compromised.

The Hindu sent an email query to the Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy, Mumbai asking about the seriousness of the breaches if they occurred at all. However there was no response. When contacted, the Public Relations Officer of IGCAR, Kalpakkam, quoting the Director of the facility said that the hacking of emails was “old news” and there was no breach of classified data. Computer engineers were working on the issue, she said.

Mr. Kothapalli said: “I am in the process of finishing the remaining investigation and contacting the respective government organisations to alert them on this issue. It is not just government organisations, but the details of the employees of several multinational companies, Indian companies etc. have also been leaked. At this stage, it is important to be proactive, revoke those credentials and take proper security measures. It is high time that two-factor authentication is introduced to access email accounts of employees in sensitive organisations. Another simple measure that will prevent damage from future attacks is to use a password manager and set separate passwords for various web-based services.” The Government of India is yet to contact him following the alert sent on Monday, he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dt6xor/article30686282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Hackers,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/researcher-finds-email-accounts-of-top-government-officials-compromised/article30686102.ece
58,2020/01/29,Protesters raising ‘harmful’ slogans: Javadekar,"Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said on Wednesday that while people had the right to air their opinions and protest, certain slogans being raised at ongoing demonstrations in Delhi were harmful for the country.

After briefing the media about the Union Cabinet’s decisions on Wednesday, Mr. Javadekar, in response to a question about the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protest at Shaheen Bagh, said: “In a democracy, the right to give your opinion and hold protests is there, but you have to take legal permission. If some people think they won’t take permission and just sit, then this reflects on them.”

He reiterated an earlier statement that the government was asked “from both sides” why the police had entered Jamia Millia Islamia and not gone to Jawaharlal Nehru University when violence erupted during the protests. He said the police were in constant touch with the protesters in order to end the demonstration. “But, the kind of speeches being made there... ‘Assam ki azaadi’, ‘Jinnah wali azaadi’, ‘We don’t trust the Supreme Court’ and slogans for Afzal [Guru]... this is wrong for the country and can harm it,” he said.

Mr. Javadekar’s statement comes a day after a JNU Ph.D scholar, Sharjeel Imam, was arrested by the Delhi Police from Bihar on Tuesday for allegedly making inflammatory speeches, including on freedom for Assam.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/suo7t9/article26690548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-Prakash-JAVADEKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/protesters-raising-harmful-slogans-javadekar/article30686200.ece
59,2020/01/29,Services decide to issue toll tax exemption ID for personnel,"In the backdrop of the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) introducing FASTags at toll plazas and some incidents being reported of the services personnel being asked to pay toll, the three services have decided to issue a common toll tax exemption identity card to their rank and file.

“The idea was suggested as in some cases the toll officials ask for a photocopy of the Service ID which is against security rules and regulations,” a defence source said. This was agreed to at a meeting last October under the Chairman, Principal Personnel Officers Committee (PPOC) and a model ID card is being finalised based on it. Services are exempted from paying toll charges under the Toll Act.

If the toll staff ask for a scan of the ID, the personnel show the service ID but present another ID for scanning, officials said.

In addition, a recent NHAI circular which is in contravention to the exemption has created disgruntlement among the military fraternity.

The NHAI clarification dated December 16, 2019 says exemption under the Indian Toll (Army and Air Force) Act, 1901 “is available to the persons who are ‘on duty’ and does not pertain to retired personnel” and “no exemption is available on use of personal vehicle if it is not used for discharging official duty...”

However, Army officials said the exemption is as per an Act of Parliament and the NHAI circular violates that.

“The Army has proposed that residential address shouldn’t be included in the proposed card as data capturing could take place,” a defence official said. It was also suggested that only the unit name could be mentioned.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/m3l00m/article24550473.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17-VJ-TOLLGATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/services-decide-to-issue-toll-tax-exemption-id-for-personnel/article30686055.ece

The Kolkata police’s cyber cell had on Tuesday night received an email alert from Facebook about a woman having uploaded a video on her profile saying she was going to commit suicide.

The Kolkata police initiated an investigation based on the information and found that the woman stayed in the outskirts of Guwahati. The Changsari police station was contacted accordingly.

“A police team rushed to the house and rescued the lady. We came to know that she was undergoing mental trauma due to certain personal issues. After much persuasion, she was admitted to a hospital for treatment,” the spokesperson said, adding that her husband was informed about her condition.

61,2020/01/29,"Australia to intensify engagement, new envoy likely to be India-hand O’Farrell","Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s decision to cancel a visit to Delhi due to the raging bush fires notwithstanding, Australia and India are preparing for an intense period of engagement this year, said outgoing Australian High Commissioner Harinder Sidhu, outlining progress expected on strategic, trade and people-to-people ties.

While Mr. Morrison is expected to reschedule his visit to India some time before June, a senior Australian trade delegation led by Trade Minister Simon Birmingham is expected in February.

Meanwhile, in a significant move, Mr. Morrison has proposed to send a political appointee instead of a career diplomat in Ms. Sidhu’s place. According to at least two sources aware of the decision, the next envoy is likely be the former Premier (Chief Minister) of New South Wales Barry O’Farrell, who has also been the deputy chair of the Australia-India Council and NSW’s special envoy to India. In 2013, after a meeting with the then Chief Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. O’Farrell had forged a “sister-State relationship” between NSW and Gujarat, and has visited India several times.

During his tenure, Mr. O’ Farrell was a key supporter of Indian investment in Australia including the Adani Group’s Carmichael coal mine project. The Indian commodities and ports group has so far invested about $2 billion into the project in Queensland that is set to become operational soon after facing delays on account of sustained opposition from environmental groups. According to Ms. Sidhu, the mine’s operations will not be impacted by the current protests in Australia over the bush fires and the new push by Mr. Morrison’s government for renewable energy.

‘Rejoin RCEP’

Speaking about the bilateral trade and investment relationship, Ms. Sidhu said that India-Australia business ties had grown exponentially and the future course for the next decade was being set by Australia’s “India Economic Strategy” document that had been released and India’s “Australia Economic Strategy” paper that was being finalised. Ties would, however, develop quicker if India rejoined the ASEAN-led Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) that India walked out of last year, according to the Australian envoy. India has been invited to the next RCEP meeting in February, but it is unlikely to discuss terms for renegotiation.

“It remains our hope that India will seriously consider returning to the RCEP table,” Ms. Sidhu told journalists during an interaction in Delhi. “We believe that it is in India’s interests and it would deepen the economic engagement and political relationships within RCEP countries including Australia. It would reduce the risk that India would be excluded from any RCEP related or further economic cooperation down the track.”

According to Ms. Sidhu, Australia and India have made great strides in their “common vision” of the Indo-Pacific as well, adding that if India were to invite Australia to its trilateral naval exercises “Malabar” with the U.S. and Japan this year, Australia was “likely to accept”. Ms. Sidhu said she was, however, “not personally aware” that any invitation had gone to Canberra for the exercises. India has thus far rejected Australia’s overtures to join the exercises, believed to be out of a hesitation to “militarise” the Quad formation which could upset China. Australia had pulled out of the original exercises after participating in 2007, but has for the last few years expressed the hope that it could return as part of the new Indo-Pacific strategy involving all four nations.

Ms Sidhu, who leaves India at the end of her tenure next month to assume office as Deputy Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said that there had been a big “uptick” in strategic and defence ties between both countries with 39 bilateral interactions in 2019 alone. “I think the signature achievement of my time has been the incredible growth in the breadth and the depth of the India-Australia relationship,” Ms. Sidhu said. “Since 2017, the quadrilateral dialogue (Australia-India-Japan-U.S.) has come together, as has the trilateral with Japan, and now the trilateral dialogue with Indonesia as well,” she added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mnedrd/article30685820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARINDERSIDHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/australia-to-intensify-engagement-new-envoy-likely-to-be-india-hand-ofarrell/article30685821.ece

64,2020/01/29,"Student suicides rising, 28 lives lost every day","“Live a little every day, ek hi zindagi mili hai (You have got but one life).” These were the last few words found on an eight-page-long note written by a deceased postgraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H). The student was found dead on July 2 last year in his hostel room.

Every hour one student commits suicide in India, with about 28 such suicides reported every day, according to data compiled by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The NCRB data shows that 10,159 students died by suicide in 2018, an increase from 9,905 in 2017, and 9,478 in 2016.

Maharashtra had the highest number of student suicides in 2018 with 1,448 — almost 4 suicides every day — followed by Tamil Nadu with 953 and Madhya Pradesh with 862.

Between 1999 and 2003, 27,990 students ended their lives; 28,913 between 2004 and 2008; and 36,913 between 2009 and 2013. The 2014-18 period saw a 26% jump from the preceding 5-year period to 46,554.

Hold a mirror to education system

Suicides in premier institutes such as IITs hold a mirror to the education system. As per data from the Department of Higher Education, under the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), 27 students across 10 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) committed suicide between 2014 and 2019. IIT Madras tops the list, with seven students losing their lives during this period.

In April last year, 19 students in Telangana committed suicide in a week after the State’s intermediate results were announced. Two years back, in another tragic incident in Madhya Pradesh, 12 students including six girls ended their lives in a single day after the release of the board exam’s results.

Kota, primarily known as a coaching centre hub, has seen a series of student deaths every year. As per the data available from the district administration, 58 students ended their lives in Kota between 2013 and 2017.

Rate highest in the 15-29 age group

According to a 2012 Lancet report, suicide rates in India are highest in the 15-29 age group — the youth population. The report says that among men, 40% suicides were by individuals aged 15-29, while for women it was almost 60%.

Mrugesh Vaishnav, president of the Indian Psychiatric Society said, “Stress, anxiety disorder, depression, personality disorder — all these result in mental illness that leads a student towards suicide. This happens when the students are not familiar/satisified with his or her surroundings.” Relationship breakdown is another leading cause.

In 2017, Lokniti-CSDS released a survey which showed that 4 out of 10 students went through depression. The survey conducted in the age group 15-34 years also found that one out of every four youth moderately suffered from depression, loneliness, worthlessness and suicidal thoughts. Six per cent of them got suicidal thoughts at least once.

Md. Sanjeer Alam, faculty at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, New Delhi, said, “A student commits suicide when he doesn’t get emotional support at the time of crisis. This might happen when individual expectations are too high. Parental and peer pressure also have an adverse effect.”

A.K. Joshi, Professor and Head of Sociology, Banaras Hindu University, stated, “Academic stress is an obvious factor for students taking their own lives. After studying to a certain level when they feel they are supportless or he/she can’t fulfil their own and their parents’ role expectations, a role conflict starts within the student. In this type of situation students feel they are left without any choice and so they take such an extreme step.”

Pradip Kumar Saha, Director of Institute of Psychiatry, Kolkata, said, “Fear of failure is a leading cause for suicide among students. When students pass through an unsuccessful phase, everything seems pessimistic to them. They feel their future is bleak and this may result in committing suicide.”

65,2020/01/29,Analysis | Congress assessing how prolonged focus on CAA/NRC will impact its electoral fortunes,"Of the 29 States, four States have so far passed a resolution rejecting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), a legislation that was cleared by Parliament on December 11.

Kerala was the first one to do so on December 31, followed by Punjab on January 17, Rajasthan on January 25 and West Bengal on January 27. Together these four States send 100 members to Lok Sabha.

Of these, only two are Congress-ruled States.

The Chief Ministers of the other three Congress-ruled States — Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Puducherry — have spoken out against the CAA and asserted that the National Register for Citizens will not be extended to their respective States, but a formal resolution against the CAA has not been moved in the Assembly. The official word is that the Budget sessions are scheduled for February in all the three States during which the resolution will be tabled. And there is so far no word from Maharashtra and Jharkhand where the Congress is a junior partner in the government.

The Congress feels that Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand results followed by protests against the CAA, which took the government by surprise, have opened up space for them and started an anti-government narrative which so far was missing. But the party is not sure on how prolonged focus on the CAA/NRC will impact its electoral fortunes.

The insiders say the decision to push tabling the resolution for the Budget session is primarily for two reasons. One there is a growing view in the party that discussions around the CAA has rapidly reduced down to a communal debate. “Yes, as per our convictions we have to oppose a blatantly unconstitutional law such as CAA but the question we need to answer is does it politically help us. If there is a Hindu-Muslim polarisation on the issue, then BJP will benefit. Also this obliterates any discussion on the economy,” an AICC secretary said on condition of anonymity.

Second, the party feels that the Delhi Assembly elections, scheduled for February 8, can provide empirical evidence on the public opinion. The party is waiting to see if the BJP drastically improves its tally from the current three seats in the 70-member Assembly based on a campaign solely dependent on the CAA. “Once the Delhi Assembly results are out, we can be more sure-footed on the CAA,” the AICC secretary said.

“In Chhattisgarh, the Muslim population is merely 2-3%. Madhya Pradesh also has similar numbers. In both the States, the resolution will eventually be passed but perhaps not with the same urgency like the border States of Rajasthan and Punjab,” a leader from Chhattisgarh said.

The CAA/NRC protests continue to be led by common citizens. While the Opposition will pick the flag once the citizens’ participation wanes, so far it has failed to make a collective and emphatic stance. Five key Opposition parties — Trinamool Congress, DMK, SP, BSP and AAP failed to attend a meeting organised by the Congress of all the Opposition parties on January 13.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l72ape/article30544507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CWCMEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-congress-assessing-how-prolonged-focus-on-caanrc-will-impact-its-electoral-fortunes/article30684820.ece
66,2020/01/29,Change in Constitution Bench hearing petition on higher compensation to Bhopal gas victims,"Supreme Court judge, Justice Arun Mishra, on January 29 informed lawyers that a curative petition filed by the government for enhanced compensation to Bhopal gas tragedy victims will be listed before a different combination of judges on February 11.

The change on the five-judge Constitution Bench follows a decision by Justice S. Ravindra Bhat to withdraw from hearing the case. Justice Bhat had appeared for the government in the case in the past. A new judge would now replace Justice Bhat on the Bench.

The government is seeking compensation, over and above the $470 million already paid by Union Carbide.

The Constitution Bench is led by Justice Arun Mishra. The other judges on the Bench, excluding Justice Bhat, are Justices Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran and M.R. Shah.

In January last year, a Bench led by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had agreed to examine the petition.

Govt.’s contention

The government had contended that the compensation, determined in 1989, was arrived on the basis of assumptions of truth unrelated to realities.

A five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court had in 2011 issued notice to the Union Carbide Corporation, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Chemicals Co., U.S.; McLeod Russel India, Kolkata, and Eveready Industries, Kolkata.

The Centre had sought a re-look of the May 4, 1989 and subsequent October 3, 1991 orders of the Supreme Court, contending that the 1989 settlement was seriously impaired.

The government has sought additional funds of over ₹7,400 crore from the pesticide company.

The tragedy unfolded in Bhopal, in the State of Madhya Pradesh, on the intervening night of December 2-3, 1984, when the highly dangerous and toxic gas, methyl isocynate (MIC), escaped from the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL). It resulted in the death of 5,295 human beings, injuries to almost 5,68,292 persons besides loss of livestock and loss of property of almost 5,478 persons.

‘Colossal failure’

The court has already dismissed a curative petition filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in 2010 for enhancement of punishment.

The agency had filed the curative petition to correct the Supreme Court’s “colossal failure of justice” in 1996 when it chose to dismiss the 1984 Bhopal Gas tragedy as a result of an act of negligence, and not culpable homicide, by former Union Carbide chairman Warren Anderson and his Indian employees. Mr. Anderson died in 2014.

Dismissing the curative plea in 2011, the court had held that “no satisfactory explanation has been given to file such curative petitions after about 14 years from the 1996 judgment”.

The CBI had wanted the Supreme Court to “restore” the criminal charge of Section 304 Part II Indian Pendal Code (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against the accused persons. It had approached the Supreme Court, facing public outcry over a Bhopal court order that sentenced Union Carbide executives to two years’ imprisonment. Those convicted included former Union Carbide India chairman Keshub Mahindra.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bcrf7a/article30684789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-DISASTER-BHOPAL-POLLUTION-ANNIVERSARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/change-in-constitution-bench-hearing-petition-on-higher-compensation-to-bhopal-gas-victims/article30684790.ece
67,2020/01/29,ULFA-I chief refuses to budge on sovereignty issue for talks,"Paresh Baruah, elusive military chief of the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) has refused to budge from his primary condition for accepting New Delhi’s offer for talks — the inclusion of the sovereignty of Assam in the agenda of discussion. The ULFA-I leader, believed to be based out of the Ruili area on the China-Myanmar border, set his terms in reaction to the olive branch the Centre offered to the outfit after signing the third Bodo Peace Accord with all factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB).

Mr. Baruah has stuck to the issue of sovereignty since 2002 when music maestro, the late Bhupen Hazarika had offered to mediate for the Centre and the then undivided outfit. He backed out of a similar initiative in 2005 after the Centre made it clear that any issue other than sovereignty could be discussed.

Also Read Centre ready to hold peace talks with ULFA(I): Himanta

On Tuesday, Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma requested Mr. Baruah and his group to come to the talks table for resolving the 41-year-old armed movement. The ULFA was formed in April 1979, a few months before the anti-foreigners Assam agitation began.

“We can send a delegation for talks if the government of India gives it in black and white that the issue of sovereignty of Assam would be discussed,” Mr. Baruah said, pointing out that discussing the issue does not mean granting sovereignty.

In a statement, he also said any discussion must be held in Assam, not in New Delhi or anywhere else in India and members of his group must not be treated as a colonial power treats the colonised.

Mr. Baruah welcomed the Bodo Accord for being signed without compromising the territorial integrity of Assam.

The Assam government said the members of the NDFB would be surrendering before Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal at an official ceremony in Guwahati on Thursday. A week ago, 644 extremists belonging to eight armed groups had given up arms.

68,2020/01/29,London universities see hike in number of Indian students,"According to an analysis of new data from the U.K.’s Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) released on January 29, Indian student numbers in London grew by 34.7% in 2018-19, marking the largest numbers since 2011-12. This ranks India third in London’s overseas students tally.

India’s rise up one rank comes at the expense of Italy, which slips one place down to fourth, followed by France in fifth place — marking a rise of students from outside the European Union (EU) ahead of Brexit Day on January 31.

“It marks an impressive period of growth for India, which returned to being London’s third largest international student market after falling to fourth position three years earlier,” said London and Partners, the Mayor of London’s official promotional agency.

Applications may have been encouraged by the recent reintroduction of the two-year post-study visa for international students by the U.K. government, allowing overseas graduates a longer period of time to look for employment after their studies, it noted. The data reveals the total number of international students at London’s universities in 2018-19 was 1,25,035, up 5.8% from 2017-18 and a rise from last year’s growth rate of 5.3%.

China remains London’s largest international student market, with 25,650 students enrolled at universities in the U.K. capital. The U.S. saw growth of 5.8% to maintain its rank of second place with 7,460 students, followed by India at 7,158 students. The top five is completed with Italy at 5,625 students, down 1.2% over the previous year, and France at 4,650, up 3.9%.

“I’m delighted to see so many young people from across the world choosing London to pursue their higher education. In doing so, they’re becoming part of a global community that has produced some of the world’s most exciting and innovative companies, said Rajesh Agrawal, the Indian-origin Deputy Mayor of London.

With its world-leading universities, thriving business ecosystem and unrivalled cultural landscape, studying in London offers the opportunity to be part of a city at the forefront of creativity and innovation, he said.

London and Partners also highlighted that the U.K. capital holds the crown as the world’s best city for students, according to the QS Best Student Cities Ranking, by global education consultancy QS Quacquarelli Symonds.

Besides India, several other countries including the US, France, Japan, South Korea, are making arrangements to airlift their nationals from central Hubei province and its capital city Wuhan.

The deadly coronavirus continues to wreak havoc in China with 25 new fatalities reported from Hubei province, taking the death toll to 132 and the confirmed infection cases to nearly 6,000.

India has made arrangements to evacuate its over 250 nationals, mostly students and professionals, from Hubei province.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry which is coordinating the evacuation of the foreign nationals told PTI here on Wednesday that China would make appropriate arrangements if any country “insists” on evacuating its nationals.

“China attaches great importance to protecting the lives and health of citizens of all countries in Wuhan, Hubei province, and will continue to take active and effective measures to address their legitimate concerns and demands in a timely manner,” the foreign ministry said in response to a question.

“If a country insists on evacuating its citizens in Wuhan, China will make appropriate arrangements and provide necessary assistance and convenience in accordance with international practice and China’s relevant provisions on epidemic prevention,” the ministry said.

A large number of foreign nationals from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh from the neighbourhood besides African countries were reportedly stranded in Hubei province.

World Health Organisation chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Tuesday that the UN health body “does not recommend the evacuation” of foreign nationals from virus-hit Hubei province as he called on the international community to remain calm.

The Indian Embassy in Beijing, which is coordinating the efforts of the evacuation of the Indian nationals, on Wednesday circulated registration forms and consent notes for the Indians in Wuhan and Hubei province to be filled by them.

The embassy has reportedly compiled a list of Indians to be flown out.

Reports also said an Air India 747 Boeing has been kept ready to fly them back to India.

The embassy has informed the stranded Indians that upon their arrival in India they need to undergo a 14-day quarantine in a designated city, the name of it which has not yet been revealed.

The quarantine was necessary as experts say the incubation period of the new virus was on average three to seven days, with the longest being 14 days.

70,2020/01/29,"JD(U) expels Prashant Kishor, Pawan Varma","The Janata Dal (United) on Wednesday expelled party national vice-president Prashant Kishor and national general secretary Pawan Varma from its primary membership and other positions with immediate effect.

Soon both the leaders wished JD(U) president Nitish Kumar to “retain the chair of Chief Minister of Bihar at any cost”.

A day after Mr. Kumar said, “It’s okay if he [Kishor] stays or goes from the party”, JD(U) principal general secretary K C Tyagi on Wednesday issued a press release, which said that both Mr. Kishor and Mr. Varma have been expelled from the primary membership of the party for working and issuing statements against it and its chief.

“From their actions and behaviour, it seems that both the leaders were not ready to remain within discipline of the party and wanted to be free”, said the one-page release.

The letter said, “party’s national president had given much honour to Pawan Varma than he deserved but he thought it as party’s compulsion…he wrote a letter to party chief and mentioned some private talks while making it public which shows he does accept party’s discipline”. The letter added: “the party runs with collective responsibilities but some people get in delusion that party runs on their thoughts”.

However, Mr. Kishor and Mr. Varma did not spare time to react to their expulsion. Mr. Kishor tweeted, “Thank you @NitishKumar. My best wishes to you to retain the chair of Chief Minister of Bihar. God bless you”, and Mr. Varma said in a tweet, “Thank you Nitish Kumar ji for freeing me from my increasingly untenable position of defending you and your policies. I wish you well in your ambition of being CM of Bihar at any cost”.

On Tuesday, Mr. Kumar told journalists, “He [Kishor] works as a strategist for various parties but I want to make one thing clear. If he wants to remain in the party he will have to adhere to the basic structure of the party”. He had inducted Mr. Kishor into the JD(U) after “Amit Shah had asked him for this”, he added.

(In 2018, Mr Kumar, to everyone’s surprise, made Mr. Kishor the party’s national vice-president, calling him the “future” of politics).

Mr. Kishor tweeted in response to Mr. Kumar’s statement: “@NitishKumar what a fall for you to lie about how and why you make me join JDU !! Poor attempt on your part to try and make my colour same as yours ! And if you are telling the truth who would believe that you still have courage not to listen to someone recommended by @Amitshah?”.

Mr. Kishor also said he would come to Bihar after February 11 (Delhi results day) and respond to Mr. Kumar.

Mr. Varma too recently put Mr. Kumar in an uncomfortable situation by writing a two-page letter to him, asking for his “ideological clarity” on ties with the BJP, beyond Bihar. He also cited some “private” references of communication with Mr. Kumar on the BJP-RSS in his letter.

Mr. Kumar later snubbed Mr. Varma, saying: “He is free to go and join any other party he likes…he has my wishes”.

After the expulsion of both the leaders, State JD(U) leaders like Sanjay Singh and Ajay Alok started attacking Mr Kishor. They said, “individual is not important than party… it was bound to happen … Mr. Kishor’s corporate shop has now been shut in Bihar”.

The State BJP leaders too slammed Mr. Kishor who, of late, had also put their senior leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi in discomfiture by tweeting one of his old videos in which he (Modi) is heard slamming Mr. Kumar.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/1u99ko/article30684120.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/prashant-pavan-combo-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jdu-expels-prashant-kishor-pawan-varma/article30684105.ece
71,2020/01/29,Congress leaders attack PM Modi on economy,"Former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on Wednesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Ministers should speak facts about the economy in the Delhi polls instead of “abuse and rhetoric” while former Congress president Rahul Gandhi attacked Mr. Modi and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman over the state of the economy.

“Modi and his dream team of economic advisers have literally turned the economy around. Earlier: GDP: 7.5%, inflation: 3.5%. Now: GDP: 3.5%, inflation: 7.5%. The PM and FM have absolutely no idea what to do next,” Mr. Gandhi said in a tweet.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Chidambaram listed out three things that the people of Delhi would like to here from the Prime Minister and his Ministers who, he claimed, are cut off from the people.

“Here are three things they can speak about in the Delhi elections: the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has increased from 2% in January 2019 to 7.35% in December 2019. 2) Tax revenues will fall short of Budget estimates by ₹2.5 lakh crore in 2019-20. 3) There will be sharp expenditure cuts in programmes meant for the SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and women and children,” he said.

In a separate set of tweets, the former Finance Minister asked why the Prime Minister had not admonished his party leaders for using abusive language.

“The language used by Minister Anurag Thakur, BJP MP Parvesh Verma, BJP Bengal president Dilip Ghosh and BJP Karnataka Minister CT Ravi is appalling. It seems that, faced with imminent defeat in the Delhi elections, the BJP leaders have bid goodbye to civilised political discourse. Why are the PM and the BJP president not admonishing these leaders?” he asked.

The former Finance Minister also attacked the Union government for ‘hounding’ bankers.

“The government has suddenly discovered that “loans granted after appropriate appraisal can turn out to be non-performing. How many upright bankers were investigated, humiliated and even arrested in the last six years?” he asked.

“No banker wants to lend. That is the hard truth. Nothing that the BJP government will do now — including ring fencing — will revive the culture of lending that has been practically destroyed.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bwq23p/article30635612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIDAMBARAM-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-ministers-should-speak-facts-about-economy-not-abuse-and-rhetoric-says-chidambaram/article30684044.ece

According to a release, the proposed amendment seeks to enhance the upper gestation limit from 20 to 24 weeks for special categories of women that will be defined in the amendments to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Rules and will include 'vulnerable women including survivors of rape, victims of incest and other vulnerable women (like differently-abled women, minors) etc.

Also, the upper gestation limit will not apply to cases of substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by the Medical Board. ”Name and other particulars of a woman whose pregnancy has been terminated shall not be revealed except to a person authorised in any law for the time being in force,” the release said.

“The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 is for expanding access of women to safe and legal abortion services on therapeutic, eugenic, humanitarian or social grounds,” it added.

PTI adds:

Addressing the media after the Cabinet meeting, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said the amemdment to the ACT would ensure a safe termination of pregnancies and also give women reproductive rights over their bodies.

The extension to 24 weeks will also help victims of rape, girls with disabilities as well as minors, who may not realise they are pregnant until later, he said.

“In a progressive reform and giving reproductive rights to women the limit of 20 weeks of medical termination of pregnancy has been increased to 24 weeks.

77,2020/01/29,"Rape cases: Gujarat HC holds ‘two-finger test’ unconstitutional, violative of victim’s right to privacy","A Division Bench of the Gujarat High Court has observed that the “archaic and outdated” practice of the “two-finger test”, conducted to determine the virginity/consent of a rape victim, is unconstitutional and directed that it be discontinued immediately.

The court has also directed the trial courts in the State that in cases related to rape and sexual assaults, if they come across any medical certificate or any reference to such a test, the courts must take cognisance of the same and should initiate actions.

In a strongly worded verdict, the Bench held that such “outdated and archaic” practice was violative of the victim’s rights of privacy, physical and mental integrity and dignity.

“Our endeavour is to remind the trial courts as well as the medical fraternity that the ‘two-finger test’ is unconstitutional, as it violates the right of the victim of sexual assault to privacy, physical and mental integrity and dignity. If the trial court comes across any such medical certificate, wherein, there is a reference of such test, then it should take cognisance of the same and do the needful in the matter.”

The Bench of Justices J.B. Pardiwala and Bhargav D. Karia said the test was in direct conflict with the proviso to Section 146 of the Indian Evidence Act, which stipulated that “in prosecution for rape or attempt to commit rape, it shall not be permissible to put questions in the cross-examination of the prosecutrix as to her general immoral character.”

“Despite the aforesaid proviso, the ‘two-finger test’ leading to the formation of the medical opinion regarding consent allows the past sexual history of the victim to cause prejudice to her testimony,” the Bench observed.

The test itself was one of the most unscientific methods of examination used in the context of sexual assault and had no forensic value, it said.

“Whether a survivor is habituated to sexual intercourse prior to the assault has absolutely no bearing on whether she consented when the rape occurred. Section 155 of the Indian Evidence Act, does not allow a rape victim’s credibility to be compromised on the ground that she is of generally immoral character.”

25-year-old case

The Bench delivered the verdict in a 25-year-old case in which the trial court realised its mistake in calculating the age of the victim at a very late stage. The court had recorded that the victim was above 16 years of age and hence, it went on to determine her consent by way of the ‘two-finger test’.

However, after the verdict was pronounced by the trial court, acquitting the accused, the trial court judge realised that the victim was a minor, and not an adult as her age was miscalculated.

Erroneous acquittal

Having realised the mistake it committed, the trial court found itself in a tricky situation where it had no powers to review its own judgment in which it had erroneously acquitted the person accused of sexual offence.

Hence, a petition was filed in the High Court challenging the trial court order acquitting the accused.

Acting on the petition filed by the State, the High Court not only corrected the mistake committed by the trial court 25 years after the order of acquittal was passed but also held the accused guilty of rape and directed the accused to personally remain present before the Division Bench on January 31, when it is likely to sentence him.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/simi9z/article30318559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16DECTH--RAPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rape-cases-gujarat-hc-holds-two-finger-test-unconstitutional-violative-of-victims-right-to-privacy/article30682866.ece

81,2020/01/29,Nirbhaya convict’s plea against mercy petition rejection dismissed,"Nirbhaya case convict Mukesh’s challenge against the President’s rejection of his mercy petition was on Wednesday dismissed by a three-judge Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi. The court said a quick decision by the President did not mean there was non-application of mind.

“The quick consideration of the mercy petition and swift rejection of the same cannot be a ground for judicial review of the order passed under Article 72/161 [on mercy petitions by President/Governor] the Constitution. Nor does it suggest that there was pre-determined mind and non-application of mind,” Justice Banumathi, who wrote the judgment, held.

The Bench, also comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and A.S. Bopanna, said the suffering experienced by death row convicts could not be a ground for commutation of the death penalty.

Mukesh had alleged solitary confinement and abuse at the hands of the jailors and fellow prisoners during his incarceration.

But the court said, “The alleged sufferings in the prison cannot be a ground for judicial review of the executive order passed under Article 72 of the Constitution rejecting the petitioner’s mercy petition”.

The court, after perusing the files containing the correspondence and official notings in original handed over to it by the Ministry of Home Affairs, concluded that all the relevant documents and records were considered before arriving at the decision to dismiss the mercy plea.

“All the relevant documents viz., the judgment of the trial court, the High Court and the Supreme Court and legible and clean copy of records of the case and the details of the review/curative petitions filed by the petitioner and other co-accused along with the present status and other details of the petitioner like past criminal history, economic condition of the family of the petitioner and the recommendation of the Government of NCT of Delhi were all sent by the NCT of Delhi along with mercy petition to be placed before the President of India”, the court observed.

It was not necessary that each and every material relied upon by the petitioner-accused should have been placed before the President, it said.

Mukesh’s petition was filed under Article 32 of the Constitution. He had sought a stay of the execution of the death warrant. The Sessions Court had ordered the death sentence to be carried out on February 1. He had asked the court to call for his medical records, dating back to the time of his arrest and incarceration, which were placed before the President for a decision on his mercy plea. He had also sought for the jail records of his solitary confinement.

Death row convicts are placed in solitary confinement.

Juvenility plea

Mukesh had moved the Supreme Court shortly after it rejected a juvenility plea made by another Nirbhaya convict, Pawan Kumar Gupta. Pawan had claimed he was a juvenile at the time of the crime.

The court also recently dismissed a petition filed by one of the four condemned men, Akshay Singh, to review its May 5, 2017 judgment confirming the death penalty.

On January 28, Akshay filed a curative petition alleging that making the “collective conscience of society” a factor while deciding on whether or not to award the death penalty naturally prejudices the case against the accused.

Akshay, Mukesh, Pawan and Vinay brutally gangraped a 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012. She died of her injuries a few days later.

An accused, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar jail. A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board. He was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

The Union government recently moved an application for fixing strict guidelines for carrying out death sentences, saying that convicts tend to misuse the legal process by repeatedly filing a variety of pleas in the court.

84,2020/01/29,Explained: What are the airlines’ rules on misbehaviour onboard,"IndiGo did not respond to queries sent by The Hindu on the inquiry process followed by it before imposing the six-month ban on standup-comedian Kunal Kamra as well who the complainant was in this case. The airline has also not provided the grounds on which it has taken such a stringent action.

According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation rules on unruly behaviour, the airline has to constitute a committee to probe an incident of alleged misbehaviour. The rules provide for a three-tier action - three-month ban in case of verbal assault and six months for physical assault or sexually derogatory language. In this case, Mr. Kamra has been punished with a six-month ban for a verbal commentary made to a passenger to his face.

Airlines are known to exercise extreme caution while banning a passenger for misconduct. Mumbai businessman Birju Kumar Salla, who posted a bomb hoax onboard a Jet Airways plane, was banned some days after the incident, which forced the airline to divert to an airport enroute, deplane passengers, take the aircraft to an isolation bay to carry out a security drill. There are umpteen incidents where passengers behave aggressively onboard a plane, but airlines do not act against them.

No-fly rules

It is also important to remember the context in which no-fly rules against unruly behaviour were formulated. They were made after Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad assaulted an Air India employee “25 times” with a slipper in March 2017. The primary objective of the no-fly list was to safeguard crew and the aircraft.

The rules say that an aggrieved passenger can appeal against his ban to an appellate authority, of which an official of the Ministry of Civil Aviation is a member . But if it is the Ministry that orders such a ban, who will a passenger appeal to?

Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri’s advice to other airlines to similarly ban Mr. Kamra is also at variance what the rules said, that it was up to the airlines to replicate the ban imposed by one airline unless there were security concerns from the MHA.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/article19296075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym15kunal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/explained-what-are-the-airlines-rules-on-misbehaviour-onboard/article30681439.ece
85,2020/01/29,Man held for raping woman in Nagpur,"A 19-year-old woman was allegedly raped and an iron rod was inserted in her private parts by a man in the Pardi area here, police said on January 27.

The gruesome incident took place on January 21 and the accused, Yogilal Rahangdale (52), was arrested from Gondia district, they said.

The accused was working as a supervisor in a spinning mill where the woman was employed as a labourer, the police said.

The woman, her brother, the accused and another girl lived in rented accommodations in Pardi.

Inspector Sunil Chavan of the Pardipolice station said the woman’s brother and her female friend had gone to their village on January 21 for some work.

As the woman was alone at home, Rahangdale attempted to rape her in the night. When she resisted, he stuffed a piece of cloth in her mouth, he said.

When she fell unconscious, the accused raped her and inserted an iron rod in her private parts, Chavan said, quoting from the complaint filed by the victim.

She narrated the incident to her brother on January 24 and they subsequently lodged a complaint with the police.

87,2020/01/29,African cheetahs to prowl Indian forests,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday lifted its seven-year stay on a proposal to introduce African cheetahs from Namibia into the Indian habitat on an experimental basis.

The plan was to revive the Indian cheetah population.

In May 2012, the top court had stalled the plan to initiate the foreign cheetahs into the Palpur Kuno sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh fearing they may come into conflict with a parallel and a much-delayed project to reintroduce lions into the same sanctuary.

The court was also worried whether the African cheetahs would find the sanctuary a favourable clime as far as abundance of prey is concerned.

However, on Tuesday, a Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde was nudged by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) to take the plunge and go ahead with its plans to bring the African cat to India.

But the Bench made sure that the right precautions are taken. It set up a three-member committee, comprising former Director of Wildlife of India Ranjit Singh, DG of Wildlife of India Dhananjay Mohan, and DIG, Wildlife, Ministry of Environment and Forests, to ‘guide’ the NTCA.

Chief Justice Bobde, speaking for the Bench, directed the committee to file a progress report every four months.

Best possible habitat

The Supreme Court made it clear that a proper survey should be done to identify the best possible habitat for the cheetahs. Every effort should be taken to ensure that they adapt to the Indian conditions. The committee would help, advise and monitor the NTCA on these issues. The action of the introduction of the animal would be left to the NTCA’s discretion.

89,2020/01/29,Airline not obliged to escort passengers to boarding gate: SC,"An airline is under no obligation to escort its passengers right up to the boarding gate after boarding pass is issued at the airport check-in counter, the Supreme Court held in a judgment on Tuesday.

The passenger, after securing the boarding pass, is expected to proceed towards the security channel area and head to the specified boarding gate on his own, the court held.

“There is no contractual obligation on the airlines to escort every passenger, after the boarding pass is issued to him at the check-in counter, up to the boarding gate.” The Airlines issuing boarding passes cannot be made liable for the misdeeds and inaction of the passengers or, so to say, the misunderstanding caused to them, until assistance is sought from the ground staff of the airlines at the airport well in time, a Bench led by Justice A.M. Khanwilkar held in the 32-page verdict.

Justice Khanwilkar, who wrote the judgment, observed that there was no reason to believe that an airline ground-staff would not help a passenger who sought logistical assistance to board at the right gate in time.

The judgment came on a petition filed by Indigo Airlines against a series of decisions from the district consumer forum to the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission to give compensation to a family who missed a flight from Kolkata to Agartala in 2017.

The family had claimed they were issued the boarding passes, but the flight left without them. They were not informed by the airline ground-staff.

Setting aside the consumer fora’s decisions, the apex court reasoned that this was not a case of change of boarding gate at the last minute or any other reason by which the creation of confusion is attributable to the airline. The passengers were not denied permission to board their flight.

“The fact situation of the present case is clearly one of ‘Gate No Show’ the making of the respondents [passengers] and not that of ‘denied boarding’ as such,” the court concluded.

The court’s amicus curiae and senior advocate Rajiv Dutta, however, argued that the DGCA guidelines “should be more humane and passenger friendly, considering that the profile of air passengers has become more inclusive, covering passengers from hinterlands and countryside, cutting across diverse social and income groups.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a88nrw/article30678913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THINDIGO-29jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/airline-not-obliged-to-escort-passengers-to-boarding-gate-sc/article30678901.ece

Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Puri on Monday announced the government’s plan to sell 100% stake in Air India.

The BMS, in its statement, said it was “unfortunate” that public sector undertakings were “being sold in the name of resource mobilisation to fund social spending”. “We hold a strong view that selling PSUs to private players is not going to help the government in mobilising resources and funding social spending because privatisation does not free the government from its responsibilities,” it said.BMS said it was a “flawed” idea. When calculating Air India’s profit or loss, it was important to factor in the airline’s operation in low-profit or loss-making routes in order to connect people, which a private airline would not do.

91,2020/01/29,George Soros’ Open Society Foundations moves Delhi High Court against Union Home Ministry,"Foreign donor — Open Society Foundations (OSF) — promoted by billionaire philanthropist George Soros has moved the Delhi High Court against the Centre’s decision to place it under a “watch list” for funding NGOs and associations that are not registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).

Any NGO that expects to receive foreign funds has to mandatorily register under the FCRA.

The OSF moved the court days before Mr. Soros criticised the Narendra Modi government at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos citing its actions in the Kashmir Valley and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 as the “biggest and most frightening setback” to the survival of open societies worldwide.

The foreign donor was put under the watch list or “prior permission” category in 2016 but it moved the High Court only this month. Through its plea, the OSF sought to know the reasons for which it was placed under the list and why no prior notice was served to them.

Following the plea, the Delhi High Court issued notice to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and the RBI on January 10. Justice Rajiv Shakdher asked the MHA and the RBI to respond within two weeks and fixed March 12 as the next date of hearing.

Jonathan Birchall, lead communications officer, OSF, stated “The Open Society Foundations confirm the filing of a petition in the Delhi High Court. The Open Society Foundations respect the wisdom and independence of the court and will be making no further statement on the matter.”

OSF’s website says legal advocacy groups supported by it and other international funders have played a vital role in safeguarding India’s intellectual property laws, enabling the production and marketing of generic, lower-cost versions of new lifesaving medicines.

It added that since 1999, more than 650 students have received scholarships from Open Society to attend some of India’s top colleges and universities.

In 2016, the MHA placed two other influential U.S.-based donors — the World Movement for Democracy (WMD) and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) — under scrutiny following adverse intelligence inputs. The restriction means the donors are not allowed to directly send money to NGOs or associations without a clearance from the MHA. The MHA writes to the RBI which then asks banks to alert any transaction to the accounts of the beneficiary NGOs from the foreign donors and seek prior clearance from MHA before the funds are released.

There are more than 20 foreign donors under the government’s scanner right now. Of these, eight were put under the prior-permission category during the UPA government and 13 after the Modi government came to power in 2014. The U.S.-based Ford Foundation, which was also put under this category in 2015, was taken off the list days before Mr. Modi was to visit Washington the same year.

As of now there are around 20,000 NGOs registered under the FCRA. Registration certificates of around 14,500 associations were cancelled for various violations and non-filing of returns from 2014-19.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4umwql/article24024272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29INTHROHSOROSEUROPE-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/george-soros-open-society-foundations-moves-hc-against-mha/article30686579.ece

“The NPR has been there since 2011, it’s not a new thing… but, in the new format with more questions it can create confusion in the country,” Mr. Kumar told journalists, while addressing them after a day-long meeting of the JD(U) party at his official residence on Anne Marg. “Nobody knows their parents’ birth date… we believe that the Central government should continue with the old format of NPR,” the JD(U) leader, who is a key ally of the ruling NDA, added.

Asked about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) he said, “We’ve already said NRC will not be implemented in the State and as far as CAA is concerned the matter is now in Supreme Court and will be debated there… if someone has an issue, they can put it there”. Last month, Mr. Kumar had voiced his opposition to the proposed NRC, while calling for an open discussion on the CAA. The JD(U) was one of the parties that had voted to enable the law’s passage in both the Houses of Parliament.

‘Prashant can leave’

The JD(U) leader also remarked that it was up to the party’s national vice-president Prashant Kishor to decide if he wished to stay in the party or leave it. “It’s okay if he stays, it’s okay, if he goes,” Mr. Kumar remarked.

Observing that Mr. Kishor worked as a strategist for various parties, he said, “I want to make one thing clear, if he wants to remain in the party he will have to adhere to the basic structure of the party.” Rhetorically asking reporters if they knew how the political strategist had ended up joining the party, he said, “BJP president Amit Shah had told me to induct him in the party... he must have had something on his mind”. In 2018, Mr. Kumar had named Mr. Kishor to the post of national vice-president while terming him the “future” of politics.

Reacting to Mr. Kumar’s comments via Twitter, Mr. Kishor joined issue on the circumstances of his joining the party. “@NitishKumar what a fall for you to lie about how and why you made me join JDU!! Poor attempt on your part to try and make my colour same as yours! And if you are telling the truth who would believe that you still have courage not to listen to someone recommended by @AmitShah?,” he tweeted.

Earlier, responding to questions about the criticism levelled both by Mr. Kishor and the party’s national general secretary and spokesperson Pawan Varma at the party leadership, Mr. Kumar said “someone wrote a letter, I replied to it. Someone is tweeting, let him tweet. Anyone can stay as long as they want, leave whenever they want. Ours is a different kind of party”.

Last week, Mr. Varma had put Mr. Kumar in an uncomfortable situation by writing a letter seeking “ideological clarity” on the party’s ties with the BJP, beyond Bihar. Mr. Kumar had in turn said Mr. Varma was free to go and join any other party he liked, adding that “he has my wishes”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/unokbx/article19397324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-NITISHKUMARjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/npr-in-new-format-likely-to-create-confusion-says-nitish-kumar/article30678463.ece

It is learnt that the CID has evidence that Mr. Kishore, former CEO of Economic Development Board (EDB), had spent ₹16 crore of public money lavishly, by violating the financial rules for taking part in World Economic Forum at Davos in Switzerland, in which the former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and his team participated in January 2018.

Mr. Kishore allegedly played a crucial role in this misappropriation of government money.

Quid pro quo

Further, the former CEO also allegedly paid as quid pro quo to a media organisation, which came up with survey findings that the TDP was going to win the elections.

The CID alleged that quid pro quo was done by Mr. Kishore, who gave advertisements to another subsidiary of the media group for promoting the former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister. In return the channel allegedly broadcast a false exit poll which was contradictory to all other exit polls.

Mr. Kishore also allegedly gave ₹60 lakh work order to his “interested” agency through limited quotation system. Surprisingly the other two competitive bidders never participated in that bidding.

Speaking at his swearing-in here on Wednesday, Mr. Sailajanath said all the regional parties were bowing before the Centre that was taking “anti-people decisions.”

In such a scenario, it was only the Congress that could stand by the people and fight for them, he said.

Mr. Sailajanath dared Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to pass a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR) in the Assembly.

He asked the Congress activists and leaders to come out of their comfort zones and reach out to the masses.

Oommen Chandy, Congress party in-charge of Andhra Pradesh, said, “The party’s position in the State is not good, but we have good space here. Special Category Status (SCS) was assured by the UPA, but the BJP failed to accord it because it is against the State. The regional parties are weakened. The YSRCP government in the State has also become unpopular in a short time.”

The underlying objective is to create world-class infrastructure in those IPs and only then showcase the investment opportunities on global stages like the World Economic Forum (WEF).

Water availability is going to be a part and parcel of that ecosystem which the Department of Industries and Commerce has aimed at, said Minister for Industries and Commerce, IT and Skill Development Mekapati Goutham Reddy.

Cautious approach

In an exclusive interview to The Hindu on Wednesday, Mr. Goutham Reddy said the government has adopted a cautious approach to allotting land and giving incentives lest the State should become a haven for fly-by-night operators.

Besides, efforts were under way to attract garment manufacturers into the Chittoor-Nellore industrial belt from Chennai and IT companies from Bengaluru into an IT Park being developed in Anantapur.

Another significant thing which the government has started doing is negotiating with the South Korean ‘Chaebol’ Hyundai Group for becoming a partner in the establishment of the steel plant in Kadapa district.

‘Quality investors welcome’

The government was keen on giving land to companies which were quality investors having concrete plans for investment and future expansion but not craving for subsidies.

The Minister said importance was given to roping in IT companies to Visakhapatnam, and skill development for which the funds of 25 to 29 departments were being pooled to equip youth with skills that the industry needs.

Apart from these, the Industries and Commerce and Agriculture Departments were working together to harness the potential of the agriculture and horticulture sectors by “industrialising the agricultural processes and products.”

Facts like A.P. standing first in the production of eight fruits but utterly lagging behind other States in drawing the value thereof prompted the two departments to set up a joint task force, which began its work recently.

As far as the subsidy regime is concerned, Mr. Goutham Reddy said he suggested to the Union Minister of Industries and Commerce that the subsidies offered by the States should be shown in their budgets as ‘debt outstanding’ to fix accountability. This would go a long way in making the States fulfil their obligations while a robust policy framework ensures that the industries delivered their commitments, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/future-ready-policies-being-framed-says-mekapati/article30686990.ece
96,2020/01/29,Govt. giving big push to aqua sector: Minister,"Minister for Animal Husbandry, Fisheries and Marketing Mopidevi Venkataramana Rao on Wednesday said development of the aqua sector was a priority for the government.

Addressing a press conference at the Secretariat, Mr. Venkataramana Rao said like agriculture, the Jagan Mohan Reddy government had identified aqua sector as an equally important area. Pointing to the long coast the State was gifted with, he said the government was keen on making the best of this advantage.

The State contributed 40 % of the foreign exchange earned by the Marine Products Export Development Authority. To further develop this sector, plans were afoot to construct fishing jetties. As part of encouraging the activity, aqua farmers were given subsidised electricity, they were paying ₹ 1.50 per unit and the move had cost the exchequer nearly ₹ 550 crore.

Fishing harbours

Following a survey on the proposed location of major and minor fishing harbours, it was decided to construct major and minor jetties in 22 places. In the first phase, fishing harbours would be set up at Vadarevu, Uppada, Machilipatnam and Juvvaladinne and in the second phase, they would be set up at Budagalapalem, Edduvanipalem, Pudimadaka and Kothapatnam.

Each of these jetties would cost ₹ 350 crore and the burden would be shared by the State and Central governments with the latter chipping in with a matching grant, the Minister said, adding that construction work would begin this year. He said the Centre had responded favourably for modernisation of the Visakha fishing harbour at a cost of ₹ 100 crore.

98,2020/01/29,Palnadu district to be carved out of Guntur,"The historic, faction-ridden and rugged Palnadu region is all set to witness a major transformation in the days to time.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has given the nod for making the region a district. Narsaraopet, a growing municipality and Gurazala, could be choices for district headquarters. A land which once witnessed the historic Palnadu epic battle and bitter contests between the Congress and the TDP, could see better days.

Kasu Mahesh Reddy, MLA of Gurazala, said the State government had issued orders notifying Gurazala and Dachepalli as ‘nagara panchayats.’

‘A promise kept’

“What we had promised, we are delivering. A government medical college at Gurazala, a Palnadu district and now upgrading the two panchayats into nagara panchayats, will usher in a change in the region , which has remained backward over many years. The water grid project aimed at bringing water to the doorstep of people will soon become a reality,’’ said Mr. Mahesh Reddy.

The State highway between Addanki and Narketpalli passes through Piduguralla and Dachepalli connecting through a bridge at Pondugula.

Further, carving out a new district would make it easier for getting approvals from the Medical Council of India. The decision to carve out a new district also would fulfil the YSR Congress Party election promise of making every Lok Sabha segment, a new district.

In case a district is formed with Narasaraopet as headquarters, it would have Narasaraopet, Chilakaluripet, Gurazala, Sattenapalli, Pedakurapadu, Macherla and Vinukonda Assembly segments.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/palnadu-district-to-be-carved-out-of-guntur/article30686116.ece

102,2020/01/29,"Naidu spreading falsehood on safety of Vizag, alleges Botcha","Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana on Wednesday accused TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu of indulging in false propaganda that the G.N. Rao Committee and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) did not favour development of Visakhapatnam as the Executive capital citing its vulnerability to cyclones.

After initially questioning the credentials of the expert committees, Mr. Naidu seemed to taking their reports seriously, the Minister observed, and wondered how Mumbai and Chennai, located close to the sea, were flourishing as the capital cities of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.

Decentralisation of administration could only be delayed, but not stopped entirely, Mr. Satyanarayana told the media at the party central office at Tadepalli.

Mr. Naidu was known for taking U-turns and would never take a clear stand on issues, the Minister observed.

He flayed the TDP, the JSP, and a section of the media for saying that Visakhapatnam was not safe.

He asserted that the YSRCP government had taken the decision to decentralise administration and development after the high-power committee did a thorough analysis of the recommendations of the G.N. Rao Committee and the BCG. In contrast, the TDP Government had ignored the findings of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee constituted by the Central government, he alleged.

Council abolition

On the abolition of Legislative Council, Mr. Satyanarayana said that Mr. Naidu had in the past demanded that it be scrapped. “When the YSRCP government wanted to scrap the Upper House, he raised a hue and cry for political reasons,” the Minister said.

He blamed Mr. Naidu for the financial woes of the State, and reiterated that decentralisation was well on course in tune with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s commitment to the development of all regions.

Replying to a question on land pooling in Visakhapatnam, the Minister said it was for the construction of about 1.76 lakh houses for the poor.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/6xi08p/article30689597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30VJPG4-BOTCHA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-spreading-falsehood-on-safety-of-vizag-alleges-botcha/article30685082.ece

106,2020/01/29,Sea fish vanishes from market as corona threat looms large,"Though a cross section of public in the tail-end Chittoor district are familiar with the dreaded coronavirus and its threat since a week, its immediate impact on the commercial front is felt on the sea fish trade. At the fish markets in the urban areas, including the municipalities of Chittoor, Puttur, Nagari, and Srikalahasti, stocks of sea fish has gone dry since Sunday. The fish traders term it a ‘sudden development’, and that they are yet to understand its ramifications fully.

A rich variety of sea fish regularly finds its way to the urban fish markets in Chittoor district from Chennai’s fishing harbour and surrounding villages. The stocks would pour in considerably large quantities on Sundays and Wednesdays. The varieties of ‘vanjaram’ and ‘sora’ would dominate the market, selling like hotcake. Some families, who believe in the health benefits of sea fish, hardly miss visiting the market a single day. It is estimated that the tail-end district would make a monthly business of about 30 tonnes of sea fish.

The traders at Satyavedu, Srikalahasti, Varadaiahpalem, B.N. Kandriga and Nagalapuram mandals get stocks from the Pulicat Lake and Tada in the neighbouring Nellore district, apart from the TN villages abutting the lake and the Bay of Bengal. Close to 100 families from Satyavedu and Varadaiahpalem mandals are involved in selling sea fish in the eastern mandals. Coming to Puttur, Nagari, Tirupati, and Chittoor markets, the supply comes from Chennai in trains and trucks. Small quantum of sea fish would further reach Madanapalle, Kuppam, Palamaner, and Piler in the western side.

On Wednesday, sea fish went literally missing from the urban markets. The traders were forced to keep small quantum of sea fish at some corners, hoping to sell them but in vain. Fearing to place sea fish and local fish (from village tanks) together on display at the markets, the traders soon removed the former.

Potential carrier

Babu, a senior fish merchant at Puttur market, said that fear psychosis has gripped the fish consumers that sea fish could be the potential carrier of the coronavirus all way from the shores of China to the Bay of Bengal and beyond. “For the next one month, the people would not be in a position to dare purchase the sea fish. We had procured some stocks last week from Chennai, but could not sell much due to Republic Day on Sunday. We have a small quantum left now, and we are ready to abandon the same. In view the present threat of coronavirus, we too can’t make business with it,” he said.

Coming to the rural markets, the sea fish business is yet to face any bigger threat. “While the educated families stopped coming to us, our regular customers are not bothered about the threats of the virus spread through sea fish,” said a woman fish merchant at Varadaiahpalem.

Meanwhile, the local fish varieties from village tanks and reservoirs have flooded the fish markets elsewhere in the district, with the traders hoping to cash in on ‘nil or the lowest’ sales of sea fish due to coronavirus threat. In spite of the availability of the fresh water fish, still the people are taking a back step in the urban areas, while the impact of coronavirus threat is yet to reach the rural belt.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dqr55c/article30684855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30ONGFISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sea-fish-vanishes-from-market-as-corona-threat-looms-large/article30684856.ece
107,2020/01/29,Four Nigerians among five held on online fraud charge,"Four Nigerian nationals were arrested by the cyber crime police here on Wednesday for allegedly duping a person to the tune of ₹6.62 lakh in the name of online charity. The police also nabbed a woman from India, who opened bank accounts for the accused on commission basis.

The arrested were identified as Everistus (38), Koffi Eric (32), Ohazurume Emmanuel Abuchi (30), Ogunjiofor Chukwujekwu Solomon (30) from various parts of Nigeria and Eusivia Lyngkhoi (27) from South Delhi.

The police recovered two laptops, six mobile phones, seven SIM cards, two bank passbooks, two bank cheques, an ATM card and ₹55,000 in cash. A sum of ₹1.42 lakh was seized from the bank accounts of the accused.

Addressing the media, Commissioner of Police R.K. Meena said that the victim, who lodged a complaint, received a message from one Aisha, who claimed to be an aged widow and a resident of U.K., that she wanted to donate about USD 5.5 million (approximately ₹39 crore), as charity to help the poor. In the message, she asked the complainant to contact her through e-mail. The complainant responded to the e-mail and sent all his personal details. The woman informed him that her lawyer would deal with the issue, the CP said.

“In the name of various departments like customs, insurance and RBI, the alleged fraudster demanded money in the name of processing and licence fees. Responding to it, the victim credited ₹6,62,470 to 13 banks accounts. Subsequently, the complainant came to know that he was duped,” Mr. Meena said.

Case registered

Based on the complaint, V. Gopinath, Inspector of Police, cyber crime, registered a case under Sections 419, 420 IPC & Sec 66 C 86D of IT Act and launched investigation.

A police team from Visakhapatnam, after reaching New Delhi, traced Eusivia Lyngkhoi. The police seized all the bank accounts, cheque books, ATM cards from her and based on the information given by her the team arrested the four accused from various locations.

On January 25, the police produced all the accused before the CMM Dwarakha Court, New Delhi, and obtained transit warrant to produce them before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court in the city.

The Police Commissioner suspected the accused were involved in other online frauds.

108,2020/01/29,TDP misused Council for political gain: Minister,"The decision to do away with the Legislative Council was taken as the opposition TDP scuttled the government’s development initiatives with ulterior political motives, Social Welfare Minister P. Viswaroop said on Wednesday.

Addressing the media, along with Ministers Balineni Srinivasa Reddy and A. Suresh, here, Mr. Viswaroop said, “The TDP stalled government business in the Upper House after backing certain Bills in the Legislative Assembly.”

The government, therefore, decided to scrap the House of Elders in the larger interests of the State and to spur speedy development of all the regions, the Minister said.

He expressed confidence that the resolution for abolition of the Council would get the nod of the Centre and the President as soon as possible.

Veligonda project

Earlier, chairing the Prakasam District Development Review Committee meeting in his capacity of Minister in-charge of the district, Mr. Viswaroop said the Pula Subbaiah Veligonda Project would be completed by June or July, 2020.

As many as 1.10 lakh families would be provided house sites in the district on Ugadi, and 1,860 acres of land had so far been identified for the purpose, the Minister said. Another 450 acres would be earmarked for the purpose soon, he added.

‘It’s Council’s prerogative’

Meanwhile, TDP MLA Dola Bala Veeranjenaya Swamy said the Council had every right to take its own course on the capital and other Bills as it deemed fit, and the government should not expect it to toe its line.

He hoped that the State government’s decision to scrap the Council would be rejected by the Centre.

115,2020/01/29,Token harvest of Indian pompano fish evokes good response,"The first consignment of Indian pompano fish cultured in a cage by Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) in collaboration with a private entrepreneur was sent to Kerala for consumption from here on Tuesday.

Anantam Group’s Anil Karnam, who collaborated with CMFRI, said that in the first lot, they had collected 500 kg for export to Kerala by train. Mr. Karnam told The Hindu that they would earn a profit of ₹50 to ₹100 per kg, and hoped to undertake commercial exploration of cage culture.

Scope for growth

In all, four cages have been placed off the coast to take up culturing of Indian pompano.

“The project is a pilot scheme and it has yielded an encouraging response,” Dr. Shubhadeep Ghosh, Principal Scientist, Visakhapatnam Regional Centre of CMFRI, said after the token harvest of Indian pompano at the sleep-way jetty of the fishing harbour.

The average weight of Indian pompano harvested on Tuesday is 700 grams. If cultured in a hatchery, it can weigh more. In the retail market, it is sold at ₹300 to ₹350 per kg.

VMRDA chairman Dronamraju Srinivas, who visited the sleep-way jetty to have a look at the token harvest of Indian pompano, said that the advances made in technology should be extended to traditional fishermen to enable them to have a better catch.

He also underlined the importance of sustainable fishing.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cupan2/article30681064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29-VJ-CENTRALMARINEFISHERIESRESEARCHINSTITUTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/token-harvest-of-indian-pompano-fish-evokes-good-response/article30681065.ece

119,2020/01/29,Andhra Pradesh government reaches out to women stranded in Kuwait,"The State government has reached out to four Andhra Pradesh women who were allegedly cheated by agents and stranded in Kuwait. The women were rescued from their employers and efforts are being made by the Chief Minister’s Office, the Police Department and the AP Non-Resident Telugu Society to ensure the victims are repatriated at the earliest.

The issue of the women stranded in Kuwait came to light when one of them — Karem Vasundara (26) of Athili mandal of West Godavari district — posted a video addressed to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on social media recently.

In the video that went viral, Ms. Vasundara was seen complaining from the Indian Embassy in Kuwait against agent Lakshmanrao and one Sahara who had been allegedly trafficking women

Charge against agent

“Our agent Lakshmanrao has been bringing women to Kuwait and handing them over to one Sahara madam who sells them here. There are hundreds of women here,” she said in the video.

The CMO responded to the video and asked Director-General of Police D. Gautam Sawang to ensure the victims are repatriated.

AP Disha Special Officer Deepika Patil and West Godavari SP Navdeep Singh Grewal were asked to follow up the case.

According to a release by Mr. Sawang, arrangements to bring the women to their villages are being made at all levels.

Ms. Deepika, who met the family members of Ms. Vasundara, told The Hindu that the women were relieved from the employers and efforts to repatriate them were under way.

Meanwhile, YSRCP leaders and the APNRT Society released a video of Ms. Vasundara and three other women speaking at the Indian Embassy in Kuwait.

120,2020/01/29,Siddaramaiah vacates ‘Cauvery’,"Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah on Wednesday vacated the government bungalow ‘Cauvery’ where he was living for over six years.

B.S. Yediyurappa, after taking over as Chief Minister in July 2019, had requested for the bungalow. The bungalow being close to ‘Krishna’, the home office of the Chief Minister, is more convenient for Mr. Yediyurappa’s stay, the Chief Minister’s office said.

Mr. Siddaramaiah took a few months to vacate ‘Cauvery’ as repairs were under way at the alternative residence allotted to him at Kumara Park, which was earlier occupied by JD(S) leader H.D. Revanna, said sources. Mr. Siddaramaiah had stayed in this bungalow before he shifted to ‘Cauvery’.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/siddaramaiah-vacates-cauvery/article30686946.ece
121,2020/01/29,Suresh Kumar writes to Jagan objecting to two-language formula,"Minister for Primary and Secondary Education S. Suresh Kumar has written to Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, taking objection to the two-language formula that the State government adopted in its education policy recently. He has argued that this deprives many children from learning their mother tongue Kannada, especially in border districts.

“The Andhra Pradesh government’s decision to convert all government schools into English medium and compel every student to learn Telugu or Urdu as one of the languages has defied the spirit of bonhomie that has always existed between each of our States. This impacts the morale of Kannadigas residing in border areas of Andhra Pradesh who did their schooling in Kannada medium all these years,” Mr. Kumar has said in the letter.

Recounting the long history of camaraderie dating back to Krishnadevaraya’s time and beyond, the Minister reminded the Chief Minister that “umpteen Telugu-medium schools are found in Karnataka as a reason of liberal and all-inclusive administrative mechanism in our State”.

“The decision taken by the government to follow a two-language formula will put the lives of so many Kannada teachers in jeopardy and many children will be deprived of learning their mother tongue, for the simple reason that they are living outside Karnataka,” he said.

He has requested Mr. Reddy to “take necessary action to protect the interests of Kannadigas by continuing the minority language schools, who teach Kannada as a language or as a medium”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/suresh-kumar-writes-to-jagan-objecting-to-two-language-formula/article30686935.ece
122,2020/01/29,JD(S) in touch with poll strategist Prashant Kishor,"In the light of the recent poll debacle the Janata Dal (Secular) faced, top leaders of the party have approached poll strategist Prashant Kishor to help revive the party’s fortunes in the State.

Mr. Kishor was on Wednesday expelled from the Janata Dal (United) where he was the national vice-president.

The JD(S) is in touch with Mr. Kishor, and a meeting scheduled with him to discuss the way forward had to be postponed in the light of anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests that have rocked the country, the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy told The Hindu. “We are planning to meet and discuss the issue shortly,” he added.

Pressure from the young

Since the outcome of the Lok Sabha polls in May 2019, several young leaders in the party have been asking in the party forum to consider taking services of Mr. Kishor, and the party leadership had also approached the poll strategist. The talks, however, had not made much headway.

Mr. Kishor, through his consultancy firm I-PAC, had been involved with the BJP and the Congress before. While he was part of the success of Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy-led YSRP in Andhra Pradesh, the Aam Aadmi Party roped him recently for the Delhi Assembly elections.

JD(S) sources said party supremo and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda — himself a known political strategist when it comes to State issues — had also agreed to the proposal. The drubbing that the party received in the recent bypolls to the Assembly had forced the leadership to seriously consider seeking Mr. Kishor’s help, sources said.

Meanwhile, the party is also likely to discuss the issue of continuation of K. Nikhil in the post the party’s youth wing president. According to Mr. Kumaraswamy, party leaders are divided over the issue. “Both Mr. Nikhil and I want to send out a message [about party workers getting important posts] to the public. However, there is another section in the party that thinks that the youth need to be attracted and Mr. Nikhil should be more active in the party affairs and politics. A decision has to be made after consultation,” he added.

To pay party workers?

In another development, the JD(S) is also considering paying certain number of young leaders at the taluk level to take the party’s message to the people and build the party at the ground level. “The party has realised that it is very difficult to ensure serious party work on honorary basis. We are also toying with the idea of paying some amount as retainership and involve people in the party work,” a senior party leader said.

The leader said that the reading was that the JS(S) had to look for a large number of the 224 Assembly constituencies in the State, and grow beyond the party’s stronghold of Old Mysore region.

According to the senior party leader, the party believes that it can do well in about 98 constituencies where the losing margin was in the range of 2,000 to 3,000 votes or the party candidate had polled at least 25,000 votes in the previous Assembly elections. “The party could pay young local leaders in these constituencies, who can be a bridge between the leadership and voters. We expect them to create a party base of about 5,000 workers, who will help strengthen the party. The issues that they can take up will be communicated to them,” the party leader said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/14ldxj/article30686917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGPRASHANTKISHOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jds-in-touch-with-poll-strategist-prashant-kishor/article30686918.ece

It also prescribed schedules for holding pubic grievance meetings in villages.

Announcing this at a press conference here after holding a video conference with the DCs of all the districts, Revenue Minister R. Ashok said the DCs have to hear public grievances in villages once a month. The DCs had been told to choose a village and hold public grievances meetings on every third Saturday. They have been specifically instructed to make efforts to provide on-the-spot relief, he said.Divisional commissioners had been told to visit villages twice a month while it was mandatory for tahsildars to hold public grievance meetings in villages four times a month, the Minister said. The tahsidlars would hold such meetings from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

At the rural public grievance meetings, the officials concerned would handle various issues ranging from RTC of farm land, to encroachment of government land, complaints relating to issuing of caste certificates, and regularisation of unauthorised houses built on government land, he said.

Old age pension

Mr. Ashok announced that there would not be any need for the eligible elderly persons to apply for old age pension. The government itself would identify such persons and take steps to reach the pension to them at their doorstep, he said.

Any person from a poor family who is aged 60 would get an intimation from the government through post about his eligibility to get old age pension. Such a scheme, being taken up in association with the Postal Department, would be launched in Udupi in about a week, the Minister said.

The Revenue Minister said the DCs had been instructed to ensure that repairs and construction of houses that were damaged in the recent floods should be completed within the next three months.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/village-visits-mandatory-for-key-officials/article30686873.ece
125,2020/01/29,ZP officials apprised of need for groundwater conservation,"Geologists have underlined the importance of rejuvenation of groundwater table to overcome water scarcity.

N.G. Devaraja Reddy, a geologist and earth scientist, told the Chamarajanagar district officials on Wednesday that steps should be taken to create greater public awareness on both water conservation and groundwater rejuvenation. He was speaking after inspecting a groundwater table rejuvenation facility in Yediyuru village of Mangala Gram Panchayat in Chamarajanagar district.

The facility was created under Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee scheme and the officials were apprised of the importance of creating similar models and educate the public on the methods of groundwater charging and rejuvenation. The officials were instructed to ensure that efforts are made to rejuvenate the defunct borewells before sanctioning permission for drilling new wells.

The officials were cautioned of water stress in the days ahead to avert which recharging groundwater was imperative.

Workshop

Mr. Reddy also conducted a workshop for Chamarajanagar ZP officials, on the subject. He said though India was endowed with adequate water resources, there were places of severe water stress and depleting groundwater table due to paucity of rain and monsoon failure. Though there are thousands of water bodies, they are seasonal and tend to dry besides being polluted, making them unfit for consumption. Hence, the only option was tapping the groundwater table to tide over water stress, said Mr. Devaraj.

He said there was a misconception that good rains will help recharge the groundwater table in places where there are bountiful showers. But there is an acute water stress even in places that receive bountiful rains and attributed it to unscientific conservation and utilisation methods.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gawhuf/article30686651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGBRHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/zp-officials-apprised-of-need-for-groundwater-conservation/article30686652.ece

127,2020/01/29,Coronavirus: Patients upset with lack of personal hygiene in isolation ward,"The isolation ward in the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), which has been set up to quarantine suspected cases and contain the spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV), lacks an environment that prevents spread of the virus, according to patients quarantined there.

The patients even submitted a written complaint to the hospital authorities on Tuesday.

While personal hygiene and frequent hand washing are the most important precautions to stay safe from contracting any communicable disease, patients isolated in the ward do not even have liquid soap in the toilets. “It’s a general ward with hardly a one-metre gap between two beds. We have only two toilets, one urinal and three bathrooms for 10 beds, which are not cleaned properly. I’m only using the urinal and have not used the toilet ever since I came here on Tuesday. Moreover, they have given one soap that all patients have to use,” one of the quarantined patients told The Hindu.

A 40-year-old Chinese national, who was referred from Manipal Hospital to RGICD late on Tuesday night, is also said to be unhappy with lack of adequate facilities there.

RGICD Director C. Nagaraja said that the isolated patients were concerned about lack of single isolation rooms in the institute. “It is not possible to provide single wards now. Following their complaint, we have provided them separate mugs, buckets and soap. We also have a separate waste management system for the isolation ward now,” he said.

“We have brought their (patients’) concerns to the notice of the government. We will also submit a proposal for setting up single-bed isolation wards in the institute for future use,” he said.

Four more cases

Meanwhile, four more persons with a travel history to China self reported to the institute on Wednesday. This is apart from the Chinese national who was referred from Manipal Hospital on Tuesday night.

With this, nine patients are in the isolation ward now. Of the 12 suspected cases isolated since January 24, three patients have been discharged after their samples tested negative.

The 40-year-old woman from China, whose first entry point was Delhi in the second week of December, came to Bengaluru on January 18.

“She presented with flu-like symptoms and we have guided her to RGICD as per the guidance of the District Surveillance Officer,” said Anoop Amarnath, Chief of Clinical Services in Manipal Hospitals.

More hospitals for isolation

With the isolation ward in Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases full with patients, the Health Department is now identifying more hospitals where suspected cases can be quarantined.

“We have prepared five beds each at Jayanagar General Hospital and Epidemic Diseases Hospital on Old Madras Road. If required, we will set up 10-bed wards in Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital and Victoria Hospital too,” said B.G.

The series is hosted by British adventurer Bear Grylls who shot an episode with actor Rajinikanth on Tuesday. The Forest Department has issued permission for the shooting, which is expected to be completed by January 30. Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi featured in an episode which was shot at Jim Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand.

Sources said there was no shooting involving Mr. Akshay Kumar on Wednesday and the crew spent much of the time scouting for the location. It is likely that much of the shooting will take place around Rampura elephant camp in Moolehole range, sources added.

Though wild conservationists and activists criticised the authorities for issuing permission during fire season, the officials brushed it aside on the grounds that the staff deployed for fire fighting operations was not being disturbed. They have imposed terms and conditions, including a ban on photographing during night, carrying inflammable materials, use of generator sets and other contraptions that go with any film crew.

Though the officials have justified that the focus on Bandipur would help showcase the national park to a wider audience, conservationists have said such television shows akin to soap operas do little to bring serious wildlife issues into focus.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vq14sc/article30689642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29KRAAKSHAYKUMAR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/akshay-kumar-to-shoot-in-bandipur-for-man-vs-wild/article30686013.ece

132,2020/01/29,"Farmers intensify protest, begin hunger strike","Farmers on an indefinite strike, under the aegis of the Karnataka Raitha Sena (KRS) for the last two days, have intensified their agitation by launching a hunger strike here on Wednesday.

The KRS launched the indefinite strike in front of the Deputy Commissioner’s office here on Monday demanding a minimum support price (MSP) for the produce.

The agitation is headed by KRS head Veeresh Sobaradmath.

They refused to withdraw the hunger strike even as Basavaraj Horatti, MLC, and Deputy Commissioner M. Deepa visited them.

Mr. Horatti told the farmers that he would take up the matter at the government level. However, the farmers said they would withdraw the agitation only after the government takes steps to fulfill their demands.

Mr. Sobaradmath said that the farmers were compelled to launch the hunger strike as there was no response from the government even as their agitation has entered the third day on Wednesday.

Officials of the Department of Agriculture visited the farmers and promised to open procurement centres for groundnut.

However, it was an attempt by the officials to pacify the farmers because nearly 80% of the groundnut growers have already sold out their produce, There is no use by opening up the procurement centre now, he said.

Mr. Sobaradmath alleged that the officials are in collusion with the middlemen.

Considering the loss to the kharif crop owing to heavy rain and floods, the government should have had opened procurement centres for the rabi crops like bengal gram, sunflower, and others. In absence of a MSP for these crops, the farmers are deprived of fair prices to their crops.

“This has led to distress sales. The government’s move has created panic among the farmers,” he alleged.

He also condemned the government for not responding to their pligh.

The government should also take immediate steps to announce MSP for the rabi crops and open up the procurement centres without delay, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmers-intensify-protest-begin-hunger-strike/article30685165.ece

Speaking to presspersons after inspecting the airport and its infrastructure here on Wednesday, he said that international flights will boost the development in the area.

“Many people from Kalaburagi travel to West Asia. Presently, they are using the Mumbai or the Hyderabad airports to fly there. Considering the demand, the government will start direct flights from Kalaburagi Airport. the next month, new flights for Tirupati and New Delhi will be introduced. The government would provide all the infrastructure requirements for Kalaburagi Airport,” Mr. Mohan said.

Commending the Kalaburagi district administration’s cooperation in the development of the airport, Mr. Mohan said that many private companies had come forward to invest in the district after the airport was operational.

“It takes time for the full-fledged development and operation of Kalaburagi Airport. The introduction of international flights will be a leap,” he said.

When asked, Mr. Mohan said that the work was in full swing to complete Bidar Airport and the government will plan the development of agro-based industries, Information Technology companies, and other market-oriented units.

134,2020/01/29,"Finally, Yediyurappa to leave for Delhi on Thursday to discuss Cabinet expansion","After much dilly-dallying, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is finally set to leave for Delhi for a discussion on Cabinet expansion with the party’s central leaders on Thursday. He has clarified that all those who won the bypolls will be inducted into the ministry and that the number of Deputy Chief Ministers will not go up from the existing three.

He told reporters in Belagavi on Wednesday, “I will go to New Delhi on Thursday and meet party president J.P. Nadda and other senior leaders to discuss Cabinet expansion.”

On the question of whether some will be dropped from the Cabinet to make way for others, the Chief Minister was evasive. “Senior leaders in Delhi will decide on the issue of dropping anyone,” he said. With demand for berths — both from migrants who won the bypolls on the BJP ticket and old party leaders — outnumbering the existing vacancies, there has been a debate on the possibility of dropping some Ministers. “I want to induct all the leaders who won the bypolls into the Cabinet. I also want to include senior MLA Umesh Katti in the ministry. But the decision of dropping anyone from the Cabinet to make room for others will be decided by New Delhi. I will heed their advice,” added.

Asked about the prospects of creating more posts of Deputy Chief Minister, he said there would not be any additions. This gains importance in the midst of pressure from some leaders, especially Health Minister B. Sriramulu, to be given the post. “The three Deputy Chief Ministers who are serving now will continue,” he said. He did not respond to a specific question on whether Ramesh Jarkiholi would be made a Deputy Chief Minister.

Asked about shifting some offices to the Suvarna Soudha in Belagavi, Mr. Yediyurappa said he planned to hold the State Cabinet meeting in Belagavi once every two months or so. He said the State government had released ₹850 crore for flood relief works in Belagavi district alone. He said all Smart City development works would be done within the scheduled time frame.

Meanwhile, in Hassan, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said that only those won the byelections to the Legislative Assembly would get a chance to become Ministers. Speaking to presspersons at Channarayapatna on Wednesday, the Minister claimed, “As per the Supreme Court’s order, only those who won the byelections can become Ministers.” This was in response to the former MLA A.H. Vishwanath’s demand for a Cabinet berth.

He, however, said, R. Shankar, who did not contest the byelection after resigning as MLA, would get his due as he had “sacrificed” his post for the party.

Mr. Sriramulu, who was also in the town, said he was not after the Deputy Chief Minister’s post, but people wanted him occupy it. Eyebrows were raised over Dr. Ashwath Narayan and Mr. Sriramulu travelling to Channarayapatna by separate helicopters to take part in the inauguration of a private petrol station.

Four more from Belagavi?

Mr. Yediyurappa on Wednesday said all the leaders who won the bypolls, including the three from Belagavi — Mr. Jarkiholi, Srimanth Patil, and Mahesh Kumthalli — would be made Ministers. He said Mr. Katti would also be inducted. This would add up to six Ministers from the border district, including Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi and Women and Child Development Minister Shashikala P.

137,2020/01/29,Good response to bandh call,"The Bharat Bandh called by Bahujan Kranti Morcha against CAA, NRC and NPR, received good response in the city on Wednesday.

Most of the business establishments, shops, vegetable market, APMC and some of the private educational institutions remained closed as part of the protest. Though some private schools declared a holiday, they had already said that the loss of syllabus would be covered in the coming days.

Areas such as Minakshi Circle, Kittur Chennamma Market, Nehru Market, ShastriMmarket and vegetable market of Bara Kaman felt the impact of the bandh.

While the main vegetable market remained shut, the smaller weekly market where mostly farmers come to sell the vegetables functioned. Since meat sellers’ associations had extended support to the bandh, meat was not available in the market on Wednesday.

Though the Auto Rickshaw Owners' Association had announced its support, some of the auto drivers did not participate in the bandh.

While most of the private transport remained off the road, KSRTC buses operated as usual. Those who were spared from the bandh were chemists, hospitals and petrol bunks.

According to the organisers, they had called for a voluntary bandh against CAA, NRC and NPR. They claimed that over 50 organisations had extended support. The organisers said that they would continue their stir against CAA till the Act is withdrawn. Describing the Act as divisive and unconstitutional, the organisers, in a release, said that the Act was passed only to create communal divide in the country, under the pretext of giving citizenship to non-Muslims migrants of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8jh8nh/article30683237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29VIJAYAPURAMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/good-response-to-bandh-call/article30683097.ece
138,2020/01/29,"Anti nationals should get bullets not biryani, says Karnataka Minister","Karnataka’s Tourism Minister C.T. Ravi on Wednesday said that “anti-nationals should get bullet and not biryani”, tweeting in support of Union Minister Anurag Thakur who has courted controversy by asking the crowds at a Delhi rally to raise “shoot the traitor” slogans against anti-CAA agitators.

Mr. Ravi tweeted, “Those attacking Union MoS @ianuragthakur for His statement against Traitors are the ones who- Opposed death to Terrorists Ajmal Kasab & Yakub Memon, Supported Tukde Tukde Gang, Spread lies against #CAA.Anti-Nationals should get Bullet not Biryani. #IStandWithAnuragThakur.”

Mr. Ravi’s comment on anti-CAA agitators is not an isolated case. Over the last month, the protesters have seen a barrage of similar responses by the BJP leaders in Karnataka.

In early January, BJP MLA Somashekar Reddy had said at a pro-CAA rally that those opposing the law should think of the “consequences” if the majority community hits the streets against them. A case has been booked against him in Ballari in this connection.

More recently, Chief Minister’s political adviser MP Renukacharya, also at a pro-CAA rally, said that Muslims were collecting weapons in mosques instead of praying, kicking off a row. He refused to apologise for his comments and said that he would not extend any special packages to the community. Revenue Minister R. Ashok too had argued that “anyone indulging in anti-national activities” should be shot dead.

Opposition leaders in Karnataka who have spoken in support of anti-CAA protesters have also been on the receiving end. Health Minister B. Sriramulu recently chastised former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy for his “fondness for Pakistan” and said that he should settle in the neighbouring country. Mr. Kumaraswamy has been trolled extensively for his criticism of police action against anti-CAA demonstrators in Mangaluru, which left two people dead.

Following the spate of such comments, State BJP President Nalin Kumar Kateel had advised ministers and MLAs of the party to focus on work and refrain from indulging in controversial comments.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8d3xss/article30682094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ctravi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/anti-nationals-should-get-bullets-not-biryani-says-karnataka-minister/article30682095.ece

The new version of the SISDP Update — short for Space-based Information Support for Decentralised Planning — uses high-resolution data from recent earth observation satellites and offers detailed information to panchayats about their key assets.

Union Minister of State for Space and Atomic Energy Jitendra Singh on Tuesday inaugurated a multi-department SISDP workshop organised by ISRO. He also launched an upgraded geo-imaging web portal, Bhuvan Panchayat V3, for the use of sarpanches and rural stakeholders.

Lauding the contribution of satellite data in key developmental activities of various Ministries, Dr. Singh said, “ISRO, the Department of Space and space technology of India are going to be an essential tool in the making of [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi’s new India.”

For the first time, thematic maps

ISRO Chairman K. Sivan said the thematic maps of 1:10,000 scale have been generated for the first time based on high-resolution data given by ISRO’s new earth observation satellites.

They were joined by KPCC members, including MLA Prasad Abbayya, former Minister A.M. Hindasageri and office-bearers. They congregated first at B.R. Ambedkar Statue near the Head Post Office in Hubballi. Holding flags and banners, the protesters marched from Ambedkar statue to mini Vidhana Soudha covering Lamington Road, Sangolli Rayanna Statue and Kittur Chennamma Circle.

Mr. Abbayya said that despite opposition from various minority communities and progressive organisations, the Union government had not changed its stand. The opposition would continue till the new law was repealed, he said.

He termed the CAA as a draconian law that meted out injustice to not only Muslims but also to Hindus. “Giving citizenship based on documents is highly condemnable. At a time when the country is undergoing an economic slowdown, it is highly condemnable that thousands of crores are being spent to enact the law. The Union government should immediately abolish the new law,” he said.

They submitted a memorandum to the Hubballi tahsildar that was addressed to the President, seeking abolition of the new law.

Superintendent of Mysuru district police C.B. Ryshyanth told reporters that two trucks from Kozhikode in Kerala entered Mysuru late at night and were about to unload the medical waste on government land around Adakanahalli industrial area when the police intervened. He said the two trucks crossed the checkpost in Nanjangud around 3.30 a.m. on Tuesday. The police followed the trucks and caught the two occupants when they were trying to unload the medical waste.

The truck driver Afzal and cleaner in one of the trucks were arrested while the driver of the other truck escaped. The police is also on the lookout for three others from T. Narsipur police station limits in Mysuru – Tanveer, Shoaib and Kabeer – who were co-ordinating with the drivers in dumping the waste in Nanjangud.

Though complaints of dumping of waste from Kerala in Mysuru had been made earlier also, Mr. Ryshyanth said the police had managed to catch the accused involved in the dumping of medical waste after setting up a checkpost at Nanjangud.

The checkpost, that had been set up 1.5 months ago, was manned 24/7. “All vehicles passing through the checkpost between 10.30 p.m. and 6 p.m. are checked. Many vehicles are checked during the day too”, he said, claiming that no instance of robbery on the highway had been reported after the checkpost was activated.

143,2020/01/29,BJP doing what is not required to the country: Former Minister,"Criticising the Centre for the enactment of the CAA and the introduction of NRC and NPR, Congress leader and former Minister Sharan Prakash Patil said that the NDA government at the Centre was doing what was not required to the country.

“India’s economy is in crisis with steadily declining GDP. Factories are shutting and unemployment is attaining new lows. Working communities are reeling under acute poverty. Instead of addressing these issues on a priority basis, the Centre is doing what is not required to the country. Its measures are aimed at spreading hatred among communities and dividing them along communal lines,” he said, referring to CAA, NRC and NPR, at a press conference here on Tuesday.

Strongly opposing the proposed sale of Air India, Mr. Patil said the Centre was taking such measures to benefit the corporate class. “They [BJP] devastated the economy with mismanagement. They don’t have money to run the country. They are cutting funds to social security schemes. They are reducing allocations to States. They took money from RBI reserve funds. Now, they are, in a desperate bid to address the economic crisis, going to sell hard-earned Public Sector Units such as Air India, BSNL and Bharat Petroleum to their corporate friends. The government is, indeed, sold out to big corporate houses such as the Ambani and Adani groups,” he said.

The district Congress unit has planned to mobilise masses to observe the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi by organising multiple rallies and a public programme on Thursday. Mr. Patil said that the purpose of this was to make the youth aware of Gandhian principles and their importance in addressing crucial national issues. “The whole world upholds Gandhian principles. The sad thing, however, is that the same principles are being neglected in Gandhi’s home country. The worst part is that Gandhi is being projected as villain and Godse, his assassinator, is being projected as a hero by the right-wing,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/936te0/article30679138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGKALABURAGICAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bjp-doing-what-is-not-required-to-the-country-former-minister/article30679139.ece

The minor girl will be kept in the safe custody of the Women and Child Welfare Department after a complaint against her impending marriage figured on the social media page of the Bengaluru City police.

After the parents of the Mysuru girl decided on her marriage and even fixed the date, the girl’s friend put up a message on the Facebook page of Bengaluru City police with a request to stop it. Alerted by their Bengaluru counterparts, the Mysuru police swung into action and visited the address at Marballihundi in Mysuru taluk before officials of the department intervened.

Marriage cancelled

Though an inquiry by the Mysuru District Child Protection Officer revealed that the girl’s parents had cancelled the marriage scheduled for January 30, the authorities, unwilling to take any chances, decided to keep her in safe custody for now.

“The marriage had been cancelled before our intervention. But, we will keep her in safe custody in the Girls’ Home till the date of the fixed for it passes off. The girl’s parents have been directed to appear before the District Child Welfare Committee and submit an affidavit,” Mysuru District Child Protection Officer Diwakar told The Hindu.

“We have inquired with the girl. The marriage had been fixed, but she refused to get married. It was cancelled after her uncle advised her parents against the marriage as it was unlawful,” Mr. Diwakar said. The girl’s parents are agricultural labourers.

The department will keep a watch on the girl and the headmaster of her school has been instructed to ensure she attends classes regularly. Mysuru district Superintendent of Police C.B.

146,2020/01/29,Kumaraswamy hits back at BJP for trolling over dialect,"Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has hit back at the BJP for social media handles trolling him over his use of a colloquial Kannada phrase — “mini-mini powder” (shimmery powder) — at a recent press conference on the Mangaluru airport bomb scare. Social media has been abuzz with memes punning on this phrase, some even targeting the JD(S) leader’s skin tone.

He has alleged that the BJP was behind this systematic trolling as they were “intolerant of a leader of the Kannada native community” and his use of a native dialect.

Mr. Kumaraswamy, during a press conference on the Mangaluru bomb scare, had said the the bomber had used “mini-mini powder” (powder used to create sparkle in crackers) to make the so-called bomb. The JD(S) leader was trying to drive home the point that it was the work of an amateur and not to be construed as a “terror attack”. He had also accused the BJP of using the incident to divide society. The press conference was prior to the police zeroing in on Aditya Rao as the accused.

Soon, the expression “mini-mini powder” was ridiculed on social media in many ways, with some editing the words in a such a way that it appeared like a reference to talcum powder.

In a series of tweets on Tuesday, Mr. Kumaraswamy attacked the BJP and accused them of insulting Kannada. “Mini-mini is an expression used for anything that shines in Kannada in rural areas. If the BJP is making fun of that word, it is insulting Kannada,” he said. Describing trolling as a tactic the saffron party uses to divert attention, he tweeted, “Today the country is witnessing crooked politics and this ridicule and trolling is only part of that. Cowards who cannot fight a leader directly try to bring down the leader through ridicule.”

Mr. Kumaraswamy went so far as to say the BJP had the “genes of Pakistan and Nazis” which made them intolerant to the leaders of “original Kannada inhabitant communities”.

147,2020/01/29,Karnataka government asked to explain CM’s power to stall tender process,"The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the State government to explain under which provision of the law the Chief Minister had issued a note to the Additional Chief Secretary, Urban Development Department, on August 3, 2019, directing the officer not to issue job code or call for tender until further orders on the works sanctioned on February 1, 2019. They were related to over 1,000 major development projects under the Nava Bengaluru scheme.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction during the hearing on a PIL petition filed by the Dasarahalli-Rachenahalli Lake Improvement and Conservation Trust and the Jal Samriddhi Lake Improvement and Conservation Trust, Bengaluru.

The petition stated that the Chief Minister’s “illegal” interference was obstructing the execution of several projects to develop and rejuvenate lakes in the city. The petitioner also said that the Chief Minister had no authority under the law to stall the process initiated for implementing development works sanctioned by the government after making a budgetary allocation of about ₹2,500 crore. It is claimed in the petition that several crores were already spent for preparing detailed project reports. The tender process is said to be in the final stages for several projects.

On a plea of the State Election Commission (SEC) seeking a direction to the government to finalise delimitation of the 198 wards of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagra Palike (BBMP) and reservation of wards for timely organisation of elections to the BBMP council, the Bench directed the government to respond.

148,2020/01/29,High Court orders four media houses to pay ₹73 lakh,"The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday imposed a total cost of ₹73 lakh on an English daily newspaper and three Kannada television news channels to accept their unconditional apology for publishing and telecasting a false news report under the headline “₹9 crore seized in raid on judge” on December 16, 2019.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the order while dropping the contempt of court proceedings by showing “leniency and mercy” on the media houses as per the apex court’s judgments by accepting their apology though the the court held that the four media houses are guilty under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, for scandalising the judiciary by carrying false and contemptuous news reports.

The media houses had admitted that news reports were carried without any material and verification, and agreed to pay substantial amount as costs, on the direction of the court, for the damage caused to the judiciary due to publication of the false news.

The Bench held that the false news report published by the newspaper showed the High Court’s administration and the State’s judiciary in poor light as the report gave an impression to the readers that there was some thing seriously wrong in Karnataka judiciary, there were many corrupt judges in the city civil court, and the High Court was taking action against them by flouting all laws and threatening them to quit.

The Bench also pointed out that the High Court’s vigilance neither conducted a raid on any judicial officer nor seized cash from his residence as reported in the newspaper as the vigilance wing has no such powers as it is not a police station.

The damage caused due to false news is irreparable as it might have reached several people through various social media platforms and would have affected every judicial officer, the Bench observed.

‘A lesson’

The Bench said that this case should be a lesson to those who make scandalous attack on the judiciary, and showing leniency and mercy by accepting apology and costs should not be treated as weakness of the judiciary.

The Deccan Herald English daily, which had published the report with that headline, besides tendering unconditional apology, agreed to pay ₹30 lakh as costs and accepted the suggestion made by the Advocate-General to hold an impartial disciplinary enquiry through a retired senior judicial officer against the reporter who had written the report.

BTV channel has been directed to pay ₹20 lakh as costs as the channel, besides carrying false report, had also telecast an unconnected file video of counting of currency notes, which had made the viewers to believe that there was a raid on the residence of a judge of the city civil court (Bengaluru), though neither such raid was conducted nor cash was seized.

Two other channels, TV5 and Digvijaya TV, have agreed to pay costs of ₹8 lakh and ₹15 lakh, respectively, besides tendering unconditional apology and submitting a guideline for telecasting news reports pertaining to the judiciary after due verification.

As per the suggestion of the government counsel, the costs to be paid by the media houses would be utilised for repair works of judicial officers’ quarters being undertaken by the Public Works Department at an estimated cost of ₹9.3 crore.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/high-court-orders-four-media-houses-to-pay-73-lakh/article30679041.ece
149,2020/01/29,Satellite imagery-based rural planning system gets an upgrade,"An updated version of a satellite imagery-based database of rural natural resources, called SISDP, will be the backbone of planning and decision-making in the country’s 2.5 lakh village panchayats, according to its main stakeholders in the departments of Space and Panchayat Raj.

SISDP Update — short for Space-based Information Support for Decentralised Planning — uses high-resolution data from recent earth observation satellites and offers detailed information to panchayats about their key assets.

Union Minister of State for Space and Atomic Energy Jitendra Singh on Tuesday inaugurated a multi-department SISDP workshop, organised by the Indian Space Research Organisation. He also launched an upgraded geo-imaging web portal, Bhuvan Panchayat V3, for the use of sarpanches and rural stakeholders. Lauding the contribution of satellite data in key developmental activities of various ministries, Dr. Singh said, “ISRO, the Department of Space, and space technology of India are going to be essential tools in the making of [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi’s new India.”

ISRO chairman K. Sivan said thematic maps of 1:10,000 scale have been generated for the first time based on high-resolution data given by ISRO’s new earth observation satellites.

Shantanu Choudhury, director, ISRO National Remote Sensing Centre, which is the national repository of earth imageries, said that thanks to these geo-tagged databases it was now possible for rural planners to plan and locate a healthcare unit, water harvesting, and rural communication network even from the panchayat office.

Apart from supporting 100 geophysical apps of various ministries, 279 rural assets or natural resources have been geotagged and are being integrated into the database, according to Uday Raj, SISDP project director, NRSC.

151,2020/01/29,Ethanol may become main product in some sugar units,"Gone could be the days when ethanol used to be a byproduct of sugar at factories. The Centre has now suggested to all the sugarcane-growing States to consider turning ethanol into the main product to not only reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, but also to make sugar factories financially viable in the wake of crash in sugar prices in international market.

Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi told reporters here on Tuesday that the suggestion was made to the States at a recent meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The Minister said sugar factories were in dire straits as the reduction in demand for sugar in international market owing to price fluctuations and excess production had resulted in accumulated losses, unsold stocks, and pending dues towards sugarcane growers.

The Centre had informed States that 6% subsidy on interest towards loans obtained for setting up ethanol production facility would be offered to sugar factories as an incentive.

As a follow-up of this, most of the sugar factories in Karnataka were now in the process of setting up ethanol production facilities, the Deputy Chief Minister said.

He explained that there were three options for production of ethanol — producing from sugarcane juice without sugar production; using 10% of sugarcane juice for ethanol production while the rest would be used for sugar production; and producing ethanol as a mere byproduct. The Centre had proposed price structures for these three types of ethanol production, he said.

The Minister hoped that laying emphasis on ethanol production would also revive the financial condition of sugar mills, which would further help strengthen sugarcane growers.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ethanol-may-become-main-product-in-some-sugar-units/article30678991.ece

At a programme organised by Mysuru Kodava Samaj near Metropole Hotel here, dignitaries and the Kodava Samaj members garlanded the bust of Field Marshall at the Circle known as ‘Field Marshal K.M. Cariappa Circle’.

MLA L Nagendra, Maj. Gen. (retd.) S.G. Vombatkere, former MLA Vasu, councillors Subbaiah and Pramila, Kodava Samaj president K.M. Belliappa, secretary M.M. Ponnappa and others were present.

Mr. Nagendra said he would make efforts to install a statue of the Field Marshall at the Circle and would speak to the MCC on the matter.

In Madikeri, MLA Appachu Ranjan said the government should celebrate the birth anniversary across the State and urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who was in Madikeri on Monday, to declare celebrations by the government.

The birth anniversary programme was organised jointly by the Kodagu district administration, Kodava Sahitya Akademi, Field Marshall K.M. Cariappa and General K.S. Thimmayya Forum in Madikeri town.

The dignitaries paid rich tribute to the Field Marshall, remembering his service to the nation. Retired Air Marshal K.C. Cariappa also spoke.

Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy said Kodagu was a well-known tourist destination and was rich in natural resources. “Another reason for which Kodagu is known is the Field Marshall and his service to the country.

153,2020/01/29,Karnataka legislators lax in utilising local area development funds,"The State’s 300 legislators, who have been seeking funds for works in their constituencies, don’t seem to be very serious when it comes to utilising the funds available under the Karnataka Legislators’ Local Area Development Scheme (KLLADS).

Though a whopping ₹1,108.50 crore was accumulated in the offices of Deputy Commissioners in 30 districts, only ₹377.3 crore was spent till last month. According to the data available, the average utilisation of funds in all districts stood at 34.3% as on December 31, 2019. While the legislators of Raichur district are at the bottom of the table. with just 9.88% utilisation of funds. Tumakuru tops with spending of 67.37%.

These funds are usually put to use for construction of anganwadis, schools, and hospital buildings, water conservation projects, roadwork and other development initiatives. Though the Chief Minister’s Office has written letters telling legislators to submit action plans for the pending amount for 2019-20, there has been a delay in submission of plans and provision of approval. In many cases, legislators have not even submitted action plans, sources in the Secretariat said.

Polls and rain

Factors such as frequent elections in 2019 (Lok Sabha, urban local bodies, and bypolls) and excessive rainfall, which made construction work difficult, are cited among the reasons for poor utilisation of funds in the first nine months of 2019. A nexus between contractors/officials and legislators to get “commissions” by implementing works is another reason for delay and non-utilisation of funds, sources said.

Besides Tumakuru, only four other districts have spent more than 50% of the funds — Hassan (60.59%), Koppal (57.61%) Kodagu (55.38%), and Udupi (53.4%). The legislators of Bengaluru Urban spent 30.2% of the amount available, while their counterparts in Bengaluru Rural performed better (47.57%).

Under this scheme, the districts in north Karnataka performed poorly in implementation of works. The districts that utilised less than 40% of the available funding are Gadag (13.21%), Kalaburagi (16.48%), Haveri (21.76%), Uttara Kannada (23.96%), Chitradurga (24.41%), Ballari (25.14%), Yadgir (26.09%), Dharwad (29.32%), and Vijayapura (29.64%).",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8qxn72/article30678955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bgFundscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-legislators-lax-in-utilising-local-area-development-funds/article30678951.ece
154,2020/01/29,Educational institute booked for play against CAA and NRC,"The Bidar police have registered a case against Shaheen Education Institute for “insulting” Prime Minister Narendra Modi by allowing the performance of a play on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. It has been booked for sedition, among other charges.

The play, staged by primary students on the school campus on January 21, allegedly “showed Mr. Modi in a bad light”. Neelesh Rakshyal, a social worker, lodged a complaint against the school president and others for attempting to “tarnish the Prime Minister’s image” and against a man named Mohammad Yusuf Raheem for uploading a video clip of the performance on social media.

The institute has been booked under Sections 504, 505(2), 124A, 153A, and 34 of the IPC. In his complaint, Mr. Rakshyal claimed that the dialogue in the play was against CAA and NRC and even “abused” Mr. Modi for implementing the Act.

Institute chairman Abdul Khadeer told The Hindu that there was no room for anti-social activities on campus. He said the teachers had not inquired about the theme and details of the play that was being enacted. He added that action would be taken against the teachers for their “negligence”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/educational-institute-booked-for-play-against-caa-and-nrc/article30678909.ece
155,2020/01/29,"Procurement of paddy, ragi, toor, jowar and blackgram to begin","The State Cabinet sub-committee on agricultural and horticultural price stabilisation has given the green signal for procuring groundnut, paddy, toor dal, ragi, jowar and blackgram by providing the minimum support prices (MSP) as a result of a crash in prices of these crops.

Disclosing this to mediapersons in Bengaluru on Tuesday, Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who is also chairman of the sub-committee, said Deputy Commissioners of all districts had been asked to set up procurement centres. He said the increase in production level could be one reason for the crash in prices.

Paddy would be procured at ₹2,015 and ₹2,035 a quintal depending upon the quality, while white jowar would be procured at ₹2,550 a quintal. The Maldandi variety of jowar would be procured at ₹2,570 a quintal, he said.

Ragi would be procured at ₹3,150 a quintal and groundnut would be procured at ₹5,090 a quintal while toor dal would be bought at ₹6,100 a quintal, he said.

The sub-committee had prescribed a ceiling with respect to the maximum quantum of produce to be procured from individual farmers. Accordingly, the maximum quantum that could be sold at the procurement centres by individual farmers stood at 40 quintals for paddy, 50 quintals for ragi, 15 quintals for groundnut and 10 quintals for toor dal.

Seeking to allay the fear that the recent bouts of floods in some regions and droughts in some others may affect foodgrain production, the Deputy Chief Minister, who also holds agriculture portfolio, said good storage in reservoirs had helped in stabilising food production. However, he clarified that no survey or estimate regarding the foodgrain production was yet to be made.

Substantiating this, he said the fact that prices of various crops had dipped due to good production was an indication that good storage position in reservoirs due to heavy rainfall had helped farm production in some regions.

In fact, Tunga Bhadra region basin farmers had got an additional 7 tmc of water rather than the normal availability in the recent cultivation period owing to heavy rainfall, he explained. Such a healthy storage in reservoir had helped in boosting paddy production even in tail-end regions of canals of the basin, he said.

Water from dams for summer crops

There is some good news for farmers in command areas of various irrigation projects in the State as the government is thinking of facilitating them to grow summer crops this time by releasing water from the reservoirs.

Mr. Savadi said that priority would, however, be given to drinking water purposes. “We will assess the requirement for drinking water purpose and ensure availability of the remaining water for irrigation,” he said. The recent floods and heavy rains had resulted in good storage in most of the reservoirs, the minister said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4vscgq/article30678752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGMYSURUTOORDAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/procurement-of-paddy-ragi-toor-jowar-and-blackgram-to-begin/article30678753.ece
156,2020/01/29,"Mangaluru firing: Protect CCTV camera footage, HC tells State","The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the State authorities to protect the footage, if such footage existed, recorded between December 19 and 20, 2019 through CCTV cameras installed by the police, other district authorities and shopkeepers in Mangaluru city, when police resorted to firing when the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act turned violent.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangouder issued the direction on a PIL petition filed by freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy and Mangaluru city former Mayor K. Ashraf.

It has been alleged that the Mangaluru police have not registered FIRs based on complaints given by several persons with allegations against the police. Also, it was alleged that these complaints were treated as part of the FIRs registered based on the complaints lodged by the police themselves.

It has been alleged in the petition that the police had actively hunted down various people and tortured them on the street isolating individuals from the crowd; and that the police had exceeded their jurisdiction and acted in a predetermined manner by ‘targeting one religious community’.

While seeking the setting up of an Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the incidents leading to firing, the petitioners sought directions to the authorities to present the video footage of various sources as these were crucial to the investigation.

157,2020/01/29,State-level consortium for e-journals,"The Higher Education Department is planning to launch a State-level consortium for e-journals involving universities and other higher educational institutions.

The proposal has found place in the Governor’s policy address to the Assembly. The move is to counter the decision by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to stop free subscriptions to e-resources under its Information and Library Network Centre (INFLIBNET) initiative.

“The consortium is inevitable for higher education institutions, especially universities, for maintaining and accelerating the pace of research and innovation in line with the global trend in knowledge production and dissemination,” said Rajan Varughese, Member Secretary, Kerala State Higher Education Council.

The council, which had mooted the idea, observed that the UGC decision would cause a huge expenditure for the institutions and the government. Universities would have to shell out crores in order to provide access to e-resources to the academic community, it said.

“Almost all journals and databases in the relevant disciplines can be subscribed at a negotiated cost fully funded by the government/universities, with the council acting as a nodal agency in the State with the participation of all universities. Other higher educational institutions in the State could be provided access to the e-resources based on a fee,” said Dr. Varughese.

Mandatory accreditation

The policy address said that accreditation would be made mandatory for all institutions. The government would ensure decent service-wage benefits to teachers and non-teaching staff in self-financing institutions.

Universities will conduct examinations and declare results in a unified manner and on time from the coming academic session, with the use of technology.

158,2020/01/29,Ease of doing business to climb industry ladder,"The focus on improving business atmosphere and ease of doing business and establishing a new manufacturing cluster are significant pointers to the future progress of industry as evidenced in the Governor’s policy address.

The government’s aim is to turn Kerala into one of the top five States in terms of ease of doing business over the next year.

The policy address lists a slew of measures, including the launch of a 24-hour toll-free number to answer investor queries . Investment facilitation centres at the district level and the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation at the State level will also handle queries and facilitate investments.

While these measures are well-intentioned, there is a need to go in for evidence-based policy measures to improve the ease of doing business, says P.M. Mathew, director of the Kochi-based Institute for Small Enterprises and Development.

He said there were always questions being asked when investment proposals came in. “They come at the local and State levels and evidence-based steps alone can convince people of the suitability and need for fresh investments in a democratic system,” he said.

Manufacturing cluster

The policy dedicates space to underline the government effort to acquire more than 1,300 acres for an integrated manufacturing cluster in Palakkad /Thrissur under the Kochi extension of the national industrial corridor project. Preparation of a master plan for the project will begin soon, the address says.

While these measures augur well for the future, the government must be more realistic in its decisions on key issues that affect existing industries.

T.H. Badaruddin, former district president, Kerala State Small Industries Association, feels that some decisions are imposed from the top. He pointed to the case of the plastic ban, which had hit industries badly.

If the government could take a decision on establishing proper waste treatment facilities, it could have made a distinction between different types of plastic in implementing the ban, he claimed.

The Governor’s address said start-up entrepreneurs would be assisted through a comprehensive innovation acceleration scheme. The government also planned to come to the aid of MSMEs, which faced problems in raising enough funds to get them off the ground.

A new scheme for raising margin money for nano units, both in the manufacturing and service sectors would be launched soon.

Exhibition facility

The government has also decided to move ahead with a world-class exhibition facility for industries. It is being envisaged as a joint venture with the India Trade Promotion Organisation and involves building a world-class exhibition and convention centre on 15 acres near Kakkanad.

The government has expressed its concern for women workers in the handloom sector by firming up plans to launch a handloom family welfare scheme.

The research efforts of the station in the areas of crop improvement, agro-techniques, and plant protection in banana and jackfruit were well appreciated in the forum. The scientists, P.B. Pushpalatha, Vimi Louis, Gavas Ragesh, and Manju P.R. of BRS, Kannara, presented the research achievements in the review meeting.

The station maintains germplasm of 236 indigenous and exotic landraces, cultivars, endangered species, and wild accessions of banana. The collection is considered to be one of the best banana germplasm in the country and is recognised as National Active Germplasm Site (NAGS). Based on the evaluation work carried out, 28 cultivars belonging to different genomes were identified for large-scale cultivation in the State.

Value-added products

Prominent among them include Manjeri Nendran II, Attunendran, Myndoli, Zanzibar, Big Ebanga, Amritsagar, Popoulu, Karpooravalli, and Yangambi. The centre has also developed two banana hybrids, namely BRS-1 and BRS-2. Utilisation of this varietal wealth is achieved through the development of technologies for the preparation of various value-added products from banana that have great acceptance among the public.

The station is also engaged in quality planting material production in the form of suckers and tissue culture plants. The recommendations of the station for the control of pseudostem weevil, rhizome weevil, nematodes, sucking pests, leaf spot diseases, rhizome rot, and Fusarium wilt have wide adoption among the farming community.

The Biocontrol Lab established at Banana Research Station, Kannara, is renowned for its quality products of several biocontrol agents such as Pseudomonas, Trichoderma, Beauvaria, Verticillium, Entomopathogenic Nemtaodes (EPN) etc. Biofertilizer production is another activity taken up by the centre.

Publications from the station in the form of research and popular articles, books and leaflets is highly useful to scientists, students and farmers.

160,2020/01/29,ITFoK ends with Tree of Death,"The ten-day International Theatre Festival of Kerala concluded here on Wednesday. Mystic Sufiana, a Qawwali music programme by Ustad Ashraff Hydroz Qawwal and group from Bengaluru, brought down the curtain on the carnival of theatre.

In all, 19 plays, including seven international plays, six national plays, and six Malayalam plays, were performed at three venues on the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi premises.

The international section included plays from Brazil, Norway, Iran, Poland, Australia, and England.

The national section had plays from Hyderbad, Bhopal, Bengaluru, Pune, Jaipur, and Goa. Most of the plays explored themes of oppression, unrest, and migration.

The festival, themed on Imagining Communities, was aimed at bringing diverse performances under one roof, according to Akademi secretary N. Radhakrishnan Nair.

Director and performer Amitesh Grover was the festival director of the 12th edition of ITFoK.

Poor selection alleged

There is widespread criticism that the festival has lost its sheen over the years. Poor selection of plays and fund crunch are cited as reasons. The selection process lacked democracy, critics alleged. Tree of Death, a Polish play by Pijana Sypialnia Theatre, was the closing show of the festival.

The play, directed by Stanislaw Dembski, was inspired by the Polish legend of a magical pear tree that nobody can come down from.

One day, Lady Death enters the tree and from then on, people could not die. “What would our lives look like if death did not exist? What would motivate us to act, to live?,” says the director. The play was presented in a symbolic spectacle full of music. It has exaggerated and comic characters, laced with dark humour. The performance was a reference to Polish folk culture.

Salma Deewani by The Atre Company, Hyderabad, was the other play performed on Wednesday.

Directed by Bhagyashree Tarke, the play was a light-hearted take on the mundane life of a lonely Hyderabadi woman living in the old city, who also happens to be a die-hard Salman Khan fan.

The performance was an attempt at bringing together the concept of absurdity and realism on stage through imagery, audience interaction, and storytelling.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1u4m5n/article30686871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30tvtr-qawwali,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/itfok-ends-with-tree-of-death/article30686872.ece

Setting the stage for a protracted face-off in the Assembly and outside, Parliamentary Affairs Minister A.K. Balan appeared to suggest a victory for the LDF government while Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala termed it a capitulation.

Mr. Balan told reporters that the Governor read the policy address finalised by the Cabinet in toto. “Mr Khan read even the part he wanted excluded. It is a good thing,” he said. “Ideally, the Governor could have avoided expressing his reservations about paragraph 18, which dwells on the government’s opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA),” he added. Mr. Balan said the UDF conspiracy to precipitate a constitutional crisis by creating a rift between the government and the Governor had come to naught.

Mr. Chennithala countered by stating that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was constrained to cosy up to the Centre to ward off any trouble in the SNC-Lavalin case. He had no option but to appease the Governor by allowing him to air his reservations about the anti-CAA resolution passed by the House unanimously. The CBI had appealed Mr. Vijayan’s discharge in the corruption case in the Supreme Court. The Chief Minister believed that Mr. Khan could save him from the legal jeopardy. Hence, Mr. Vijayan sacrificed the interest of secular polity at the altar of self-preservation.

Mr. Chennithala demanded that the Speaker expunge from Assembly records the Governor’s remark that he had severe reservations about the anti-CAA resolution. (Mr Balan remained non-committal about the demand.) Mr. Khan told reporters later that he had witnessed worse protests during his time as an MLA and then MP.

The BJP also forced itself into the fray. Inaugurating a march in front of the Assembly, former Mizoram Governor Kummanam Rajasekharan said people would reply to the affront to the constitutional head of State by “recalling” Mr. Chennithala from the Assembly in the next election.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fronts-square-up-over-caareference-in-policy-address/article30686759.ece
162,2020/01/29,More EV charging stations to come up,"To help usher in an e-revolution on roads in the State, the government has decided to establish electric-vehicle charging stations in cities and major towns.

The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) will set up one EV charging station each in more than 60 centres in six municipal Corporations and Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode districts, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan said in his policy address.

Alarmed by the increase in electrical accidents in homes, a ‘Mission-e-Safe Home’ project will be jointly launched by the KSEB, Electrical Inspectorate, local self- government institutions and the Energy Management Centre, Kerala. In the first phase, rewiring will be done in 3,000 BPL (below the poverty line) homes. By next year, the government expects to meet 40% of the power demand through non-conventional energy sources. This will be achieved under the the Oorja Kerala Mission. CFLs and incandescent bulbs used in households and street lamps will be replaced with LEDs.

163,2020/01/29,UDF MLAs attempt to block Khan’s address,"The start of the 18th session of the Assembly on Wednesday witnessed the United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition taking the unusual step of attempting to block Governor Arif Mohammed Khan from delivering the government’s policy address.

As if on cue, the fanfare that heralded the Governor’s entry into the House catalysed Opposition legislators into action. They trooped to the well of the House and held aloft placards demanding that Mr. Khan “go back”. The MLAs crowded the aisle leading to the Speaker’s dais and shouted slogans against the citizenship law and the national population and citizenship registers. They gheraoed the Governor and accused the government of capitulating to him.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan flanked Mr. Khan. They watched stoically as the Governor faced the protesters with folded hands. The face-off lasted nearly eight minutes. The ruling front members remained on their feet, watching mutedly. The police band continued to belt out the customary slow march tune, providing a background score to the tense political drama.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister A.K. Balan requested the Opposition to make way for Mr. Khan in vain. Eventually, Mr. Sreeramakrishnan signalled the House wardens to clear the passage for the Governor. They rushed to the House and formed a wall between Mr. Khan and and the protesters. The wardens shoved the Opposition MLAs aside and opened a path for Mr. Khan.

The committee, which has district panchayat president Sebastian Kulathungal as chairman, will have all legislators and MPs from the district as patrons.

District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu is the member-secretary and Fr. Sebastian Punnassery the general coordinator.

The executive committee comprises all members of the district panchayat council and presidents of all block and grama panchayats. Punnan Kurian Vengadath and John Ashramam are the technical advisers.

Binu Kannanthanam is the coordinator of the public awareness committee while Dileep Philip and Sakhariyas Njavalli are the support committee members.

The first meeting of the committee is scheduled for February 5.

The project, which will take off on April 2, will be implemented at ₹50 crore. It will begin with a massive clean-up drive to be carried out at schools, hospitals, roads, markets, and waterbodies.

This will be followed by installing waste disposal mechanisms at all households and establishments over the next year.

Besides establishing compost treatment facility, the programme also envisages collection and segregation of non-organic waste.

Waste collection

Plastic waste will be collected using Haritha Karma Sena volunteers by charging a user fee. Further, companies will be engaged to collect and treat waste from abattoirs and poultry centres across the region.

The programme is being implemented in association with the Kottayam district administration, Haritha Keralam Mission, and the Suchitwa Mission as well.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/clean-kottayam-project-from-april/article30686727.ece
165,2020/01/29,Kollam Corpn. to create awareness of survey,"The Kollam Corporation has launched an awareness campaign after its Intelligent Property Management System (IPMS) survey was met with resistance from the residents of some divisions.

The IPMS uses latest technologies like drones and specially designed applications to collect demographic and infrastructural details of an area.

People reportedly refused to cooperate with the survey suspecting it to be a data gathering exercise in connection with the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“The objective of the survey is to create a databank that will be used to formulate various developmental projects and welfare schemes. Drone mapping agencies registered with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) are conducting the survey with the permission of the District Police Chief.

Prior to the survey, respective police stations have been informed and we are planning to complete the drone mapping in four weeks. Some people are opposing it without knowing its purpose,” said Mayor Honey Benjamin at a press meet here on Wednesday.

Area mapping

As part of the IPMS survey all buildings in the Corporation will be mapped and photographed. Other details that include roads, landmarks, waterbodies, bridges, drainage systems, junctions, traffic signals and parking areas will be collected and stored in the databank in a user-friendly mode. The data related to the area of each building will be obtained by GPS along with the spatial information of wetlands and fallow lands. “The survey will help technology-based planning and more efficient implementation of projects. It will also ensure that various welfare projects reached the right beneficiaries. Another objective is infrastructure development and execution of various projects related to agriculture, industry, health and disaster management,” she said.

The system will also collect the basic details of the residents of Kollam Corporation, including their education, profession and health records.

Cooperation needed

The Corporation officials said that the data on water availability and rainwater harvesting collected through the survey would be used to tackle water crisis in summer months.

“The cooperation of the public is very important for the survey. We want all the residents to share complete and accurate details that will be used only for ensuring their welfare,” she said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kollam-corpn-to-create-awareness-of-survey/article30686725.ece
166,2020/01/29,200-year-old tree declared heritage site,"The branches of this tree throw a canopy over Tappuzha on the banks of the Meenachil river like an expansive forest.

Growing on its trunks are a variety of plants, including some rare variety of orchids, besides a lizard species that is under threat.

In a unique initiative, the Ayarkunnam panchayat has declared the 200-year-old mango tree at Tappuzha as a local biodiversity heritage site.

Moly Thomas, president of the local body, made an announcement to this effect at a function at the panchayat office here on Wednesday.

The decision to list the tree as a heritage site followed a special motion moved by the biodiversity protection committee of the local body.

The committee received details about the tree, which represents an ecosystem, from a recent study on the plants on the riverbank.

Still bears fruit

The mango tree, which still bears fruit, supports rich biodiversity with different shrub and plant varieties growing under it, including Ixora coccinea, neer kadambu, angolam, cheru and eera, among others.

According to officials, the declaration of the area as a heritage site will help conserve and manage the location with the support of the public. The listing of the location as a heritage spot also enables the local body to initiate action against those inflicting damages in the zone under the biodiversity Act.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/200-year-old-tree-declared-heritage-site/article30686720.ece
167,2020/01/29,Crackdown on Chinese nets,"Plans to check unregulated fishing practices in Vembanad Lake are gathering steam once again after the initial setback last year.

Months after being forced to back out from a crackdown on illegal Chinese nets, the Fisheries Department has initiated steps to complete the drive engaging private parties.

Authorities have identified 80 illegal Chinese nets in the Kottayam section of the waterbody and allocated ₹14,000 for dismantling each structure.

“A fund of ₹12 lakh has been allocated for the project and we are awaiting nod from the office of the Joint Director of Fisheries,” says Ramesh K.B., Deputy Director of Fisheries, Kottayam.

Police protection

Expecting resistance from net owners like last year, the department will approach the Kottayam Collector requesting security before commencing the drive.

“The operation will be carried out in the presence of police and revenue officials. Prior to it, a committee comprising elected representatives and members of the traditional fisherfolk too will be constituted,” official sources said.

They said the majority of the nets came up only over the past few years despite a ban on establishing new Chinese nets.

“Besides operating without licence, the majority of these nets does not follow distance and mesh size requirements as well, destroying fish wealth.”

Lights too

Many of the net owners have attached electric bulbs to the Chinese nets extending power connections from lakeside houses, violating norms of the Kerala State Electricity Board.

Besides the authorities, the traditional fishermen too have been on the warpath against the illegal Chinese nets as they claim that the majority of the net owners are from outside their community.

20 removed

Early last year, fisheries officials were forced to back out of a crackdown on illegal nets near the Thanneermukkam bund in the face of protests by the net owners.

Later, about 20 of the nets were removed by the owners themselves fearing legal action.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/crackdown-on-chinese-nets/article30686718.ece
168,2020/01/29,Pilot schemes by local bodies on the cards,"An integrated local government management system will be in place in all grama panchayats to streamline the delivery of various e-services to the citizens.

Describing it as one of the projects earlier envisaged in the Panchayati Raj system, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan’s policy address on Wednesday said that 900 grama panchayats and all block panchayats in Kerala had already secured ISO certification and emerged as single-window service stations for the citizens. By January-end, all grama panchayats will be able to secure the ISO certification.

Pre-fab tech

The pre-fab technology would be employed more in the oncoming housing projects under the LIFE Mission, which would also tap the scope of crowd funding and support of sponsors. The construction of 85 such projects has begun in the State and it could be completed by the end of 2020.

Three projects for conversion of solid waste to power would be considered for the effective management of construction and demolition waste in selected zones in Kerala.

Self-help groups

“For senior citizens, differently abled and transgender people, there is plan for forming separate self-helping groups under local self government bodies,” the Governor said. The formation of an extensive volunteer network under the Kudumbashree Mission for various services and the opening Small Entrepreneurship Resources Centres would be part of the reforms in the sector.

Disaster management plan

An exclusive Disaster Management Plan (DMP) for local bodies with a volunteer base of 3,40,000 citizens to act in times of emergency situations is one of the newer initiatives mentioned by the Governor to strengthen the disaster management system in Kerala. “The DMP and the annual plan of local bodies can be integrated for the project realisation,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pilot-schemes-by-local-bodies-on-the-cards/article30685476.ece
169,2020/01/29,Kerala govt. mulls reinstating Sriram Venkitaraman following drunk driving accident,"The State government is weighing whether or not to reinstate IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman.

The 2013 batch officer had come under a cloud after the police implicated him in the controversial drunk driving accident that caused the death of journalist K.M. Basheer in August last.

Subsequently, the government had initiated disciplinary action against Mr Venkitaraman. It appointed Sanjay Garg, Principal Secretary, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Department, as the inquiring officer and Power Secretary, B. Asok, as the presenting officer.

Also Read Police chargesheet against IAS officer Sriram Venkitaraman soon

The government had instituted the inquiry after it found the written statement of defence by Mr. Venkitaraman wanting.The inquiring officer had presented his report to Chief Secretary Tom Jose in October last.

Suspension

The argument that suspension from service is part of the inquiry process, and the government should not use the process as a means to penalise officers without proving the charges against them might weigh in the officer's favour.

Mr. Venkitaraman had earlier appealed to the government to reinstate him in service as per the provisions of the All India Service (Discipline and Appeal) Rules 1996.

The plea was perceived widely as a precursor of an impending request to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) for a favourable order to get himself rehabilitated in the civil service.

In his petition, Mr. Venkitaraman reportedly rejected the police finding that he was drunk and was at the wheel of the vehicle at the time of the collision.

Crime Branch probe

Mr. Venkitaraman is currently the subject of an ongoing criminal investigation by the Crime Branch.

However, the police have no statutory medical certificate to prove that the officer was drunk at the time of the accident. Mr. Venkitaraman had also reportedly claimed that he was not at the wheel of the car when the crash occurred.

The case had taken a severe turn after Basheer’s colleagues and relatives had moved the court accusing the police of having destroyed evidence by wilfully slowing down the mandatory blood alcohol test on Mr. Venkitaraman by more than 10 hours.

The CB is probing him on the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The agency is scheduled to inform the court on Thursday about the status of the probe.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iexih3/article29282683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28KRASREERAMVENKATARAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-mulls-reinstating-sriram/article30685471.ece

171,2020/01/29,Census finds fall in waterbird count in Pathanamthitta,"The two-day Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) held in seven major wetlands in Pathanamthitta reveals a fall in the number of waterbirds in the district, compared to the survey results of 2019.

The census was conducted jointly by the Kerala State Office of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-India, State Wetland Authority of Kerala, Social Forestry wing of Kerala Forests and Wildlife Department, and Pathanamthita Birders, an association of birdwatchers, at the seven locations of Karingalipuncha, Thonnallur Ela near Pandalam, Aranmula-Nalkalikkal wetlands, Ulanad Polachira and associated wetlands, Aranmula wetlands, Othera-Thiruvamanapuram wetlands, and the Upper Kuttanad wetlands of Mepral and Ezhinjillom on January 25 and 26, according to Hari Mavelikkara, coordinator of District Bird Atlas Project and Pathanamthita Birders.

The census was aimed at obtaining information on an annual basis of waterbird populations at wetlands in the region during the non-breeding period of most species (January). More than 6,100 sites in 27 countries have already been covered with active participation of thousands of volunteers, so far, says Mr Hari.

4,796 birds counted

Mr Hari says as many as 4,796 birds belonging 55 species have been counted during the two-day survey held in the seven wetlands. The maximum count of around 931 birds belonging to 39 species is from the Karingali-puncha.

However, the birders have spotted as many as 1,200 birds during the survey conducted there in January, 2019. The birders have counted nearly 931 birds belonging to 39 species in the Thonnallur fields, near Pandalam.

Mr Hari says around 366 birds have been counted at the Othera-Thiruvamanapuram wetland against the 600 birds spotted there during the previous survey.

174,2020/01/29,TCMC censures 11 doctors,"The Travancore Cochin Council of Modern Medicine (TCMC) has censured 11 doctors registered under it for violating the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002, by allowing themselves to be featured prominently in the advertisement of a corporate hospital in which they were working.

The incident is said to be unprecedented in the history of the TCMC.

It was in May last year that Aster MIMS, Kozhikode, brought out a newspaper advertisement prominently featuring some of its doctors, along with their photographs and details on their specialties.

The matter had been brought to the attention of the Registrar of the TCMC for “appropriate action” by K.V. Babu, a Kerala-based physician and public health activist.

Against Code of Ethics

Dr. Babu had taken exception to the advertisement featuring doctors because Section 6.1 of the Code of Ethics states that “...a physician shall not make use of him/her (or his/her name) as subject of any form or manner of advertising or publicity through any mode either alone or in conjunction with others... as to invite attention to him or to his professional position, skill, qualification...”

He had pointed out that while corporate hospitals were free to advertise their facilities and services, they could not advertise their services making use of the photographs and details of the doctors under their employment. Doctors should be aware of these provisions in the Code of Ethics, he contended.

Moreover, the TCMC itself had in 2018 brought out a circular that the council will be forced to take suo motu action against doctors if in violation of the Code of Ethics, they display their photographs in any hospital bill boards or advertisements. The council had then issued a warning that unless doctors removed their names and photographs from advertisements, there would be punitive action, including removal of their names from the State Medical Register.

Explanation

Following Dr. Babu’s complaint, the Ethics Committee of the TCMC had sought an explanation from the doctors . The doctors, while apologising for the ethics violation they had committed, said that their names and photographs had been used in the advertisement by the hospital without their knowledge or consent. The advertisement was only to inform the public about the new services and facilities available at the hospital, they contended.

Following the recommendation of the ethics committee, TCMC has now closed the matter after issuing a censure notice to all 11 doctors and warning them that such a mistake should not happen again.

“I am happy that the council took cognisance of the complaint and has exercised its powers properly by censuring the doctors. The Code of Ethics is binding on the doctors alone and not hospitals. Hence it is up to the doctors to know what constitutes an ethics violation and ensure that their employer too is made aware of it,” Dr. Babu said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tcmc-censures-11-doctors/article30684436.ece

176,2020/01/29,LDF pulls off a major political coup,"The ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) has pulled off a major political coup by prompting Governor Arif Mohammad Khan to deliver its stated position on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and its angst about the fear gripping the minorities in the Assembly.

The Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) bid to take the wind out of the government’s sails by blocking Mr. Khan on the floor of the Assembly got aborted once he read out the controversial references against the Act.

The decision to waylay the Governor was being perceived as an Opposition strategy to gain some lost ground from the LDF which had successfully organised a human chain as part of its anti-CAA agitation, even with the support of some Opposition members.

The LDF was widely believed to have succeeded in exposing what it had described as the UDF’s, especially the Congress party’s failure to rise up to the expectations of the minorities, both Muslims and Christians, who fear that the Act might threaten their very existence as religious communities.

Had the Governor chosen to skip the portions in question and not expressed his reservations about the government stance on the CAA, the Opposition could have mounted an attack by accusing Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and his colleagues of pandering to his wishes.

But by reminding the Governor of his constitutional obligation to deliver the policy address in its entirety, the government has succeeded in running its writ without hurting him. And that may have rendered a major jolt to the Opposition which merely chose to boycott the address virtually clueless.

Even at the height of sparring between the Governor over the government moving the apex court challenging the Act reached a frenetic pitch, Mr.Vijayan and his Cabinet colleagues chose to exercise restraint in their criticism against Mr. Khan.

Instead, it was the LDF political leadership that had taken up this task with vigour. That strategy appears to have helped keep a channel of communication open with the Raj Bhavan and prevent the row from escalating further.

Though the government and the Opposition claim of gaining an upper hand over each other in the row, the government move to bring round Mr. Khan to its stance and his decision to read the address, though after airing his personal objections, are being read as the practices of a robust democracy where areas of cooperation are explored amidst differences of opinion.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ldf-pulls-off-a-major-political-coup/article30684377.ece
177,2020/01/29,Watch | Opposition UDF tries to block Kerala Governor on opening day of Assembly,"Uproarious scenes marked the opening day of the Budget session of the Kerala Assembly on Wednesday after the Opposition United Democratic Front tried to block Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on his way to the Speaker’s dais to deliver the policy address.

Shouting slogans and holding placards reading “Recall Governor’ and ‘No to CAA, NRC’, the UDF legislators gathered in the well of the House, blocking the path of Mr. Khan who was escorted by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan. Unfazed by the protest, the Governor greeted the members with folded hands and remained standing as the Speaker and Law Minister A.K. Balan tried to persuade the UDF members to provide a safe corridor, but to no avail.

With the protesters showing no signs of retreat, the Speaker requisitioned the watch and ward to clear the path. The security personnel had to forcibly drag the protesters out of the way and clear a passage for the Governor to the Speaker’s dais.

After the National Anthem, Mr. Khan began by inaugurating the e- Assembly project and went on to deliver the policy address, even as the UDF members staged a walkout, boycotting the day’s proceedings. They later held a rally to the gate of the Assembly complex and staged a sit- in.

The CPI(M) will hold both Mayor and Deputy Mayor posts in the last year of the current tenure of the council.

Though she should have resigned on December 12 according to the seat sharing agreement within the LDF, a confusion over the position of standing committee chairperson between the CPI and the CPI(M) delayed the decision.

186,2020/01/29,Kismat to the aid of migrants,"A migrant worker from Assam employed in a food-processing unit in Thrissur lost the function of a hand following a workplace accident. The employer met the hospital expenses. But after discharge, he refused to help the worker financially. His family took up the matter with the Labour Department, but it was not resolved. Next they approached the District Legal Services Authority, where language posed a barrier.

Kismat (Kerala Interstate Migrants Alliance for Transformation), a project of the Don Bosco Salesian House for the welfare of migrant workers, came to their rescue, and thwarted efforts to foil the case by exploiting the communication issues.

With the intervention of the Kismat district coordinator, the family was eventually able to secure a compensation of ₹2.5 lakh from the employer, and return to Assam.

Kismat has been able to make scores of such interventions in the past year to help migrant workers who are vulnerable due to language issues, alienation from the local population, and issues at the workplace.

Poor, unskilled, and exploited, they are unable to access rightful entitlements such as shelter, medical care, education, banking, legal support, and so on. It is here that Kismat steps in.

Help desks

Launched in August 2018, Kismat has 12 migrant help desks across 11 districts. From food and accommodation to wages to recreation, Kismat has assisted the migrants in leading a life of dignity.

A significant initiative of Kismat is camps for registering migrant workers under the State government’s Awaaz insurance scheme. Kismat has helped get ₹34.12 lakh from the Awaaz scheme as compensation for deaths and from sponsorship from well-wishers.

It has also facilitated settlement of 105 wage theft cases and helped in settlement of ₹61.92 lakh during the year. Awareness programmes on migrant workers’ rights, government schemes, labour laws, safety measures at work, financial literacy, and de-addiction are organised by Kismat.

At Pothencode, Kismat intervened as local residents refused to send their children to an anganwadi where children of migrant workers were admitted.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/szn5ib/article30678653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29tvKismat,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kismat-to-the-aid-of-migrants/article30678654.ece
187,2020/01/29,Miyawaki forests to be developed across State,"The Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-DISC) has embarked on developing urban micro-forests in the State by adopting the Miyawaki afforestation technique to enhance tree cover within limited spaces.

The government-constituted strategic think-tank has identified 10 plots of 20 cents each spread across the State to adopt the popular farming method, developed by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki. The project is being undertaken in association with Nature’s Green Guardian Foundation (NGGF) in urban and coastal areas, some of which faced the threat of coastal erosion.

Initial phase

In its initial phase, the Miyawaki afforestation project will be implemented in the Chala Government High School, Thiruvananthapuram; Asramam Maidan, Kollam; sites of the Muziris Heritage Project in Alappuzha and Thrissur; Cochin University of Science and Technology; Ponnani in Malappuram; Walayar Forest Training Institute, Palakkad; Butt Road, Kozhikode; Bekal Resorts Development Corporation Ltd., Kasaragod; and a plot in Kannur.

According to Shakeela K.T., senior programme executive, K-DISC, a multi-stakeholder technical committee, led by Chief Conservator of Forests, Eco Development and Tribal Welfare, Padma Mahanti, has charted a full-fledged plan for the project implementation. The monitoring, evaluation and documentation of various parameters, including soil and air quality, and soil fertility, will be undertaken by NGGF, the designated technical partner for the programme.

The plants will be nurtured for three years by when they are expected to grow over 30 ft. It is expected that a dense forest equivalent to 100-150 years of growth can be achieved through the rapid afforestation project in nearly 10 years.

The Statewide project will have a soft launch at the Chala school here on Wednesday. The programme will coincide with the 92nd birthday of Dr. Miyawaki.

With the aim of ensuring the participation of students, students police cadets in the school will be entrusted with the maintenance of the forest.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/miyawaki-forests-to-be-developed-across-state/article30678640.ece
188,2020/01/29,Dexterity wins him admirers at skill show,"For a schoolchild, Midhun S.T. displays extraordinary dexterity and craftsmanship, as he works on a small piece of wood. The ninth standard student held viewers in awe with his skill in carpentry at the zonal competitions of the India Skills Kerala 2020 on Tuesday.

Hailing from a family of modest means, Midhun grew up watching his father’s skill in the profession.

He learned the ropes of the work by helping his father, and in due course started creating woodwork of various forms and shapes on his own.

Unlike many of his peers hankering after technology-aided skills, Midhun opted for his family’s traditional calling to exhibit his talent at the five-day zonal competitions organised by the Industrial Training Department (ITD) and the Kerala Academy for Skills Excellence (KASE).

A student of Government Technical High School, Krishnapuram at Kayamkulam, Midhun is the youngest participant of 17 contestants in the South Zone competitions in Carpentry, held at the Government Industrial Training Institute (ITI), Attingal, here. Barring Midhun and another student of VHSE, Vattiyurkavu, all other contestants in carpentry were ITI students.

Earlier, in a science fair, Midhun’s skill and workmanship grabbed the eyeballs of those present when he came out with various models of pistols and guns carved in wood. He had also received ‘A’ grade in Still Model in the State Technical School Youth Festival held in Kannur last year.

The projects are part of the 100-day action plan drawn up in connection with the fourth anniversary of the Corporation council.

The Minister said the LDF-ruled civic body had made creative interventions in addressing the city’s problems, and ensuring the public’s participation in them. The city was an example of how waste could be managed without opting for a centralised waste treatment plant.

The first tranche of the ₹2,100 crore aid from the World Bank for waste management, addressing drinking water issues, and scientific management of drains in civic bodies had been received, the Minister said.

Mayor K. Sreekumar presided.

The complaint redressal cell aims at addressing citizens’ complaints regarding the city Corporation’s services in time and effectively. It includes the Corporation secretary, deputy secretary, revenue officer, and health officer. Complainants will be informed of the action taken through the Smart Trivandrum web portal. Complaints can be submitted directly, or through the Smart Trivandrum mobile app or WhatsApp on number 703423323 or e-mail to complaints.tmc@gmail.com

The action to be taken on the resolution will be decided in consultation with Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who is also the Leader of the House, and the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the Assembly that is scheduled to meet on January 31, the Speaker said at a press conference here.

The Speaker said the resolution moved under Rule 130 by Mr. Chennithala was “legally admissible” and that he could not comment on the “content of the resolution and on political mileage”.

To be notified

“I am bothered about the procedures. It will be immediately notified in the Assembly bulletin with the heading “no-day-yet-named motions”.

Mr. Sreeramakrishnan said Rule 136 allowed the Speaker to allot time for discussing any such motion after considering the state of business in the Assembly and in consultation with the Leader of the House or on the recommendation of the BAC. To a query, the Speaker said he did not anticipate a face-off between the Governor and the government in the budget session.

“There is no need for any apprehension on the policy address. The Cabinet decides the policy. It is the policy of the government and the Governor will have to inform the House and the people,” he said.

192,2020/01/29,Woman who walked ahead of her time,"Jameela Malik, who died in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday at the age of 73, may not have made it big as an actress, but she was a woman who walked ahead of her time.

She joined the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII), Pune, at a time when not many women in Kerala thought of learning acting academically. Jameela was the first woman from Kerala to study at the prestigious school for cinema.

She probably remained the only Malayali woman to appear in Malayalam cinema after graduating from the Pune institute. A girl hailing from a conservative Muslim family studying to act in films in the 1970s must have been unusual indeed.

Short career

But that background did not help Jameela make a successful career in cinema, though. She was noticed in films such as Ragging and Pandavapuram, but faded away before long.

“I remember her performance in Pandavapuram, which was a rather good film, directed by G.S. Panicker,” Pradeep Nair, a national-award winning director, told The Hindu. “And Jameela had done an excellent job. Her acting had that subtlety that you could find in actresses trained at the Pune institute like Shabana Azmi,” he said.

Mr. Pradeep said it was unfortunate that Jameela could not succeed as an actress in Malayalam cinema. “That may have been because she didn’t have the face or the figure of the typical Malayalam film heroine of the day,” he said.

“That was when leading ladies like Sheela, Jayabharathi, K.R. Vijaya, Sharada and Sreevidya reigned supreme. Someone like Jameela could easily have become successful heroine in today’s Malayalam cinema, though,” he added.

Life a struggle

It was equally unfortunate that Jameela had to struggle to earn a living. “I remember watching a television interview of hers in which she said that she had worked as a matron at a hostel,” said Mr. Pradeep. “I heard that she also gave Hindi lessons to students to make a living. It is strange that someone who was academically as qualified her was not given a job at the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy or at the film institute run by the government,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jj81pq/article30678523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29tvjameela,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/woman-who-walked-ahead-of-her-time/article30678524.ece
193,2020/01/29,Malayalam theatre makes a mark at ITFoK,"The Malayalam plays staged at the 12th edition of the International Theatre Festival of Kerala have made a presence with their strong stance on contemporary socio-political issues and stunning performances.

All the six plays – Chillara Samaram, Veendum Bhagavante Maranam, Cherala Charitham, Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavam, Old Man and Sea, and Bombay Sketches – were performed in front of packed audiences and received critical acclaim.

Chillara Samaram, directed by Arun Lal, deals with anti-human development programmes and their toll on the common man and their livelihood. Accompanied by the performance of a young team, the play, told in a satirical and hilarious language, says the challenges posed by capitalist development policies are not that simple.

Veendum Bhagavante Maranam, directed by Hazim Amaravila, is a dramatic adaptation of K.R. Meera’s short story. It depicts the problems faced by a theatre group when it tried to dramatise Meera’s story written as a reaction to the assassination of noted writer Kalburgi.

Cherala Charitham is the independent dramatisation of Vinoy Thomas’s novel Karikkottakkari. The play, directed by K.V. Sajith, tells the story of converted Dalit Christians as they flee from South to North. It also delves into the history of Kerala, and how Cheralam, the land of Cherans, became Keralam.

Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavam, directed by Suveeran, is a play based on a novel written by Paul Zacharia. It tells about the story of an obedient slave Thommy, a Christian migrant worker, and his aggressive tyrannical master Baskara Pattelar.

Life’s struggles

Old Man and Sea, based on Ernest Hemingway’s famous novel and directed by Sasidharan Naduvil, is a story of a poor and unlucky old Cuban fisherman Santiago who knows that only a person with willpower and determination can become a warrior. Santiago’s struggle depicts the act of living with hope and never-ending enthusiasm. It becomes the struggle of the oppressed.

Bombay Sketches, directed by Prasant Narayanan, tells about the transformation of old Bombay to the new metro city and the untold pains and frozen tears of people who went to oblivion during this transformation. It talks about the story of the downtrodden and those who lost their shelters.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/g0urx9/article30678498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29tvdrama,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/malayalam-theatre-makes-a-mark-at-itfok/article30678499.ece

He said Mr. Vijayan’s condemnatory statement that the youths were urban Maoists, a term borrowed from the lexicon of the Sangh Parivar, had pained Kerala.

Talking to mediapersons after visiting the dam at Kumily on Tuesday, he said there was no need for anxiety on the security of the dam. The committee members hoped that there would be a positive response from the Kerala government with the proposal to strengthen the baby dam.

The Kerala government had not given permission to fell the trees close to the dam to take up the construction works.

This was in addition to the proposal pending with the Kerala government for drawing power lines to bring electricity to the dam area.

Mr. Singh said the delay in construction works was due to the location of the dam inside the forest and permission was required from various departments. He said that security steps, including setting up of CCTV cameras, in the dam would be put in place soon.

Road repair sought

The members representing Tamil Nadu requested the committee to take steps to repair the Mullaperiyar-Vallakadavu road which was destroyed in the 2018 floods and electrification of the dam. The committee said that permission of the Forest and Environment Ministry was needed for road repair works and drawing power lines.

196,2020/01/29,How the online movie ticketing business is poised to grow in Tamil Nadu,"So, when was the last time you stood in a queue outside a cinema hall to book a ticket?

Chances are that it would have been ages ago — for, with the increase in smartphone users, moviegoers are largely preferring to book through mobiles or online mode. Online movie ticket booking companies like market leader BookMyShow and TicketNew/Paytm are bullish about their growth prospects. In fact, this 2020 festival season (Pongal, Sankranti, Lohri), BookMyShow created history when it sold a record 2.1 million tickets in India for a single day (January 12)!

The Pongal week has been among the busiest times for such online platforms. Ashish Saksena COO-Cinemas, BookMyShow, said, “Rajinikanth’s Darbar, Allu Arjun’s Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo and Mahesh Babu’s Sarileru Neekevvaru have been widely accepted by audiences in the South. The success of these films has been instrumental in creating history with the platform selling 2.1 million movie tickets for a single day, while also clocking seven consecutive days of 1 million ticket sales on the platform. The blockbuster films from the South have contributed to 51% of the overall ticket sales on BookMyShow, leading to a record-breaking milestone.”

Walk-in versus online

Rakesh Gowthaman of Vettri cinemas in Chrompet, a suburb of Chennai, was one of the first standalone twin theatres to introduce online ticketing facility. Gowthaman explains, “In the early 2000s, there was no advance booking for any films in Tamil Nadu outside of Chennai city. Those days, walk-in crowds dominated, as tickets were sold one hour before a show starts. We went online with Rajini’s Enthiran in 2010 and sold around 23% of our total tickets for the film online. It was a huge success. Today, a decade later, we sold 82% of the total tickets via online for Darbar.”

As per market sources, out of approximately 10 crore movie tickets sold in Tamil Nadu in 2019, 3.5 crores were sold via online platforms. The total size of cinema tickets sold in Tamil Nadu during 2019 was valued at around ₹1350 crores, out of which almost 35% were sold online, which is huge by any yardstick. Chennai and its suburbs in Chengalpet and Kanchipuram districts account for almost 60% of online tickets sold. The rest of the State is not far behind, particularly towns like Vellore, Tirupur, Kumbakonam and Tirunelveli. A place called Punjai Puliampatti, near Tirupur, has Sridevi Cinemas multiplex, which features among the top 20 in Tamil Nadu in online sale of movie tickets. The forecast is that online ticket sales will be more than walk-in audiences by the end of 2021. Of course, there are some theatre owners who prefer to retain 10 to 15% for walk-in audiences, who are not used to online booking. Films like Kanchana 3 and Namma Veetu Pillai turn out to be superhits due to “walk-in audiences”, according to sources.

Future scope

Ramkumar Nammalvar, founder of TicketNew, a major player in Tamil Nadu, said, “With increasing internet and smartphone penetration, people are realising the convenience of online booking. Now, 65% of the screens in Tamil Nadu have online booking and more multiplexes are coming up in smaller towns. The scope for movie-goers to book on mobiles is huge in the future.”

Meanwhile, there is a battle brewing between national multiplex players (PVR & INOX), who are making inroads into Tier 2 and 3 towns, and established local players in the state. Tamil Nadu has the largest number of single screens in the country and online ticketing has come as a blessing for them. While the national multiplexes have their own state-of-the-art booking apps, the local players depend solely on major online ticket apps, with which they have exclusive deals. Gowthaman adds, “We cannot afford to run our own booking app, as the cost of running and maintenance is high. So we have an exclusive deal with TicketNew that has helped in our sale of tickets and concessions.” The lure for audiences while booking online seems to be that they are able to choose their favourite seats in advance and not stand in queues at the ticket counter. The future seems bright too, because like everything online worldwide, cinema ticketing is also set to grow. And as far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, those screens that are strong in online platforms are bound to survive and flourish in the long run.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/g1c1n6/article30684002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1144743901,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/how-online-ticketing-works/article30684003.ece

198,2020/01/29,Priyanka Chopra Jonas in talks to join ‘Matrix 4’,"It seems Priyanka Chopra Jonas might be getting ready to take the red pill and board the Matrix franchise.

According to Variety, the 37-year-old actor, who has made a successful foray into Hollywood, is in final negotiations to join the cast of Matrix 4 which will see Keanu Reeves’ reprising his fan-favourite character of Neo.

However, the details of Priyanka’s character have not been revealed.

The film, which is yet to be officially titled, will also mark the return of Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity and Jada Pinkett Smith as Niobe.

Lana Wachowski, one half of the Wachowskis who directed all the three films in the sci-fi action franchise with sister Lilly, will write and helm the new project.

Aleksandar Hemon and David Mitchell have co-written the script with Lana, who is also attached to produce with Grant Hill.

Previously announced cast members also include Aquaman star Yahya Abdul-Mateen, Jessica Henwick, Neil Patrick Harris and Jonathan Groff.

The first film in the series, released in 1999, depicted a dystopian future where artificial beings have taken over humanity, which is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality, called the Matrix.

It spawned two sequels The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions, which released back-to-back in 2003.

Priyanka, who started her Hollywood career with ABC series Quantico, has featured in films such as Baywatch and Isn’t It Romantic. She will next be seen in Netflix’s We Can Be Heroes and The White Tiger adaptation, opposite Rajkummar Rao.

She is also set to star with Game of Thrones actor Richard Madden in Amazon Studios’ upcoming thriller series Citadel.

199,2020/01/29,Rajinikanth on TV debut after 43 years: ‘It offers inspiring real-life entertainment’,"Superstar Rajinikanth has said he decided to make his small screen debut four decades after his silver screen entry, by way of an adventure show as it offered him “inspiring real life entertainment.”

The 69-year-old actor, who shot for the Into The Wild with Bear Grylls episode in Mysore, is the second big Indian name after Prime Minister Narendra Modi to feature on the show.

The show will also talk about water conservation.

“Into The Wild is a truly unique show at one level it offers adrenaline pumping action, while at another, the show lends itself beautifully to driving a specific purpose for the larger good of society,” he was quoted as saying in release from Discovery.

“So, when, officials from Discovery, a brand globally respected for offering inspiring real-life entertainment, approached me, I agreed to finally make my debut on TV after more than four decades of cinema,” he said.

Kavithalayaa, the Production house founded by his mentor and ace filmmaker the late K Balachander, also played a “significant role,” apparently over his small screen debut, the actor said but did not elaborate.

He said Grylls has tested the survival skills of many celebrity guests, “pushing them to their limits”, adding, he looked forward to the survival challenge.

On water conservation, Rajinikanth said every Indian will need to come forward and contribute and that “this war has to be led at all levels including government, community as well as on the individual front.”

The star said the show “is a perfect platform to take the message of conserving water to every home across the country.”

Grylls was quoted as saying that his team was “very excited to work closely with” the Superstar. “Much more than a cine star, Rajinikanth is a phenomenon who has captivated audiences across the world with his on-screen and off-screen work,” said Grylls, adding, “He has always shown such energy and flair in all he does and he will need that courage and determination again on our journey into the beautiful wilds of India.”

Bear Grylls has also hosted prominent celebrities in the past such as then-American President Barack Obama, Kate Winslet, Roger Federer and Julia Roberts among others.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ossprm/article30682361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rajinikanth-with-Bear-Grylls-Into-the-Wild,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rajinikanth-on-tv-debut-after-43-years-it-offers-inspiring-real-life-entertainment/article30682362.ece
200,2020/01/29,"The message should be part of the subtext, says Bhaskar Hazarika on directing ‘Aamis’","“My job is to think of weird subjects... only then will my content be fresh,” Bhaskar Hazarika said, about audiences at screenings questioning him on how he hit upon the idea for his Assamese film Aamis.

Aamis, or Ravening, has intrigued and provoked audiences around the globe in equal measure, since its release last year, and has earned the filmmaker substantial critical acclaim. “Trust me, you have not seen anything like Aamis coming out of India,” said Anurag Kashyap in an Instagram video last year. Kashyap went on to present the film as well.

Aamis traces the story of Nirmali (Lima Das), a married doctor, who befriends Sumon (Arghadeep Barua), a young student researching food habits in Northeast India. While they bond over their love for food, their relationship goes on to take a dark and almost bizarre turn as it tests societal boundaries.

Hazarika was in Chennai recently weekend for a screening of the film by cinema club Cinema Rendezvous, for an audience of over 90 people. “While I initially expected a lot more people to get provoked by the film, the way we have presented the story has made a difference. Our aim was never to vulgarise the relationship between Nirmali and Sumon or titillate. And the audience in turn empathises with the story. They are left with a lot of questions surrounding morality and societal taboos.”

The filmmaker burst into the limelight with his début film Kothanodi, which won the National Award for best Assamese film in 2016. “It was the first film in Assamese to be picked up by Netflix,” he said, describing streaming platforms as a game-changer in promoting regional content.

Kothanodi was also partly funded through a successful crowd-funding campaign, and paved the way for many more filmmakers from Assam to explore different avenues with regard to financing their projects. “Assam has the highest number of cinema halls in the Northeast, and while we might be behind compared to other States with regard to the cinema-viewing culture, we are catching up quickly,” he said.

Message in the subtext

Going back to his love for fresh subjects and content, Hazarika said that the social commentary in his films will always be natural and unconscious. “I can never declare that I will focus on a specific subject and then go on to make a film about it. It should be the other way round — if there is a message, it will be part of the film’s subtext,” he said, when asked about the themes he wants to focus on.

What about movies with a message? “It should come off as an experience. As a viewer, you should be able to feel it,” he said.

Both Kothanodi and Aamis feature prominently in the acclaimed filmography from Assam over the last few years, alongside Bulbul Can Sing, Village Rockstars, Ishu, and Ratnakar. “Films from Assam are getting better every year. Similar to Malayalam film Industry, I feel we’re surging forward and putting forth films with fresh, interesting subjects year after year.”

The filmmaker, who has a writing credit for the 2012 Bollywood release Players, said it isn’t wise for filmmakers to isolate themselves from the Hindi film industry. “You might not like the way they think, but it is impossible not to be associated with them,” said Hazarika, who also hinted at a Bollywood project in the coming year.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jgf96r/article30681530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29MPAAMIS99,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/aamis-director-interview/article30681531.ece

And if not you, then who?” asked Sudha Ramen, Deputy Director of the Arignar Anna Zoological Park, who was the chief guest at the launch of Young World’s Whoopee 30!, an exclusive collection of stories, on Wednesday, at Seth P.D. Hinduja Sindhi Model School, Chennai.

The book, published to commemorate Young World’s 30th anniversary this year, features 30 captivating stories penned by much-loved children’s authors including Paro Anand, Jerry Pinto, Devika Cariapa, Natasha Sharma and Sowmya Rajendran, among others. The genres range from humour and fantasy to grief and mystery. Designed by Sonal Goyal and illustrated by the award-winning Ashok Rajagopalan, the book is a definite keepsake.

Sudha Ramen, deputy director, Arignar Anna Zoological Park, spoke on the importance of ecosystems and the need to protect them. Her engaging talk covered topics like conservation, ecosystem services, conservation methods, and sustainable living.

The highlight of the event was Lydian Nadhaswaram’s spontaneous interaction with the students. He emphasised the importance of practice and shared his journey through the finals of The World’s Best, a reality talent competition, which Lydian won last year.

203,2020/01/29,"TNPSC scam is Tamil Nadu’s Vyapam, says Alagiri, seeks CBI probe","Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Wednesday demanded a CBI probe into the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) Group-IV services examination scam terming it ‘Tamil Nadu’s Vyapam scam’ [a scam in recruitment in Madhya Pradesh].​

​“If the taint over the TNPSC has been to be removed, it cannot be done through the CB-CID investigation that is under the control of the State government. The ruling dispensation will only try to cover up and save those guilty in the TNPSC,” Mr. Alagiri said in a statement.​

​Mr. Alagiri said the malpractices in the examination, in which 99 candidates have been debarred for life, has put a question mark over the employment opportunity to lakhs of students. “We can only consider this scam on a par with the scam in Madhya Pradesh. This is Tamil Nadu’s Vyapam,” he said.​

​The TNCC president said there were doubts over the speed at which TNPSC officials have claimed that no other malpractice had taken place in over 5,000 examination centres where more than 16 lakh students had written the exam. ​

​“A few years ago, question papers for the Group-II exam conducted by the TNPSC had been leaked. If the TNPSC had acted strictly and taken necessary measures then, the current scam could have been prevented,” he said.​

​Mr. Alagiri claimed that there were enough signs to believe that the TNPSC leadership and middlemen had created a situation to enable the malpractice to be executed. “This type of activity could not have happened without the support of the top management of the TNPSC,” Mr. Alagiri charged.​

​He demanded that a CBI enquiry be instituted to conduct an impartial and truthful probe into the matter so that the real culprits can be found and punished.​

204,2020/01/29,Three persons who returned from China to Puducherry kept under home quarantine,"Three persons from the Union Territory, including two students pursuing medicine in China, who reported a travel history to China recently have been kept under home quarantine as a precautionary measure said Director of Medical and Health Services, S. Mohan Kumar.

Speaking to reporters here on Wednesday, Dr. Mohan Kumar said that a businessman from Karaikal and two students from Puducherry and Karaikal pursuing medicine in China had returned to India recently. Though none of them are symptomatic, they have been kept under home quarantine as a precautionary measure. The trio will be under the supervision of surveillance officers for 28 days.

Dr. Kumar said that all precautions were being taken to improve surveillance and to quarantine people with a travel history to China. The Health Department has asked all government hospitals in Puducherry, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam and private medical colleges to set aside six beds, exclusively for any potential Novel Corona Virus (nCOV) cases.

An isolation ward with eight beds has been set up at the Government Hospital for Chest Diseases in Gorimedu. All private hospitals and medical colleges have been asked to send travellers returning from China with upper respiratory tract infections to the isolation ward.

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare also conducted an orientation programme on the virus for doctors and shared standard guidelines and treatment protocol to be followed.

205,2020/01/29,Finance companies not keen to fund e-vehicles,"Most insurance companies are not including the value of the battery in their comprehensive policies for electric vehicles, as a result of which, finance companies are not keen to finance purchases of e-vehicles, T.R. Achha, President, Federation of Indian Hire Purchase Association (FIHPA) said.

The Chennai-based federation, as a Trade Body, has nearly 1,000 members and takes care of the interests of automobile hire purchase financiers transacting business all over India.

“For the sale of vehicles, financing is very important. 95% of vehicles in India are bought through finance. When we finance a vehicle, we look at whether we can get back our money and insurance is one of the key considerations,” Mr. Achha said.

When it comes to e-vehicles, the battery accounts for a major portion of the cost. For instance, if the vehicle cost is ₹2 lakh, the battery cost comes up to ₹80,000 or more, he pointed out. “The feedback from most of our members is that since insurance companies are not taking into account the value of battery in their plans for e-vehicles, they are not keen to finance the vehicles,” Mr. Achha said.

Mr. Achha said that FIHPA has written to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) on the issue and is also planning to write to the Ministry of Surface Transport. He pointed out that the issue has become important with companies such Bajaj and TVS Motor launching their e-vehicles recently.

V. Sumantran, chairman of Celeris Technologies, and former vice-chairman of Ashok Leyland, pointed out that it is an early issue. “The issue is coming up due to lack of awareness and uncertainty over what will be the value of battery, two or three years down the line -- whether it will be 25% or 75% of its value in three years? The good news is that because of better technologies, battery life is improving and degradation of batteries is slower. So as we progress, the issue would be addressed,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lf46cv/article30682438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29JANTH-ELECTRIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/finance-companies-not-keen-to-fund-e-vehicles/article30682439.ece
206,2020/01/29,No blueprint ahead of exams for TN State Board class 10 students from this year,"For students of class 10 in State Board schools who will be writing board examinations this year, the Directorate of Government Examination has reiterated that there will be no blueprint given for reference, ahead of their exams. A blueprint generally gives the students an idea of how many marks they will be tested for, from each chapter in their textbooks.

For the last two years, the School Education Department has avoided giving a blueprint to students of classes 11 and 12 who are taking up the exams. With students of classes 10 gearing up to take the board exams under the new syllabus this year, a section of students and parents were expecting that they might be given a blueprint.

“While we are okay with not being given a blueprint, it would be helpful for the students if they are aware of what type of questions they will be tested in through a standard format,” said P.K. Ilamaran, president of the Tamil Nadu Teachers Association.

Officials from the School Education Department have said that questions can be asked from any lesson for any number of marks. “It is the School Education Department’s belief that students should read and understand all their lessons which is why we are avoiding giving a blueprint. Students and teachers must be aware that all lessons should be treated with equal importance,” an official said.

A communication to this effect has been sent to district-level education officials to instruct school heads and teachers.

The Department has further emphasized the fact that the model question paper released is just to give students an idea of the question paper pattern. “It is merely for reference and students cannot expect the blueprint of the final question paper to mirror that of their model question papers,” the Directorate of Government Examinations has warned.

Patric Raymond, General Secretary of the Tamil Nadu Graduate Teachers Federation said that so far, students have been getting only district-level common papers for their half-yearly and revision exams. “With no blueprint in place for the new syllabus, we are unsure how they will be tested in the board exams. One of the revision exam rounds that the students are writing can have a common question paper for the entire State so that students can go in more confidently for the board exams,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ykkujk/article30682203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29JANTH--BOARDEXAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/no-blueprint-ahead-of-exams-for-tn-state-board-class-10-students-from-this-year/article30682204.ece
207,2020/01/29,Automated system to check speeding on highway,"Speeding and reckless driving on the Chengalpattu-Tiruchi National Highway would soon be a thing of the past, as the Tamil Nadu government is planning to put in place an unmanned automated system to track such vehicles on a trial basis.

Presently, violations are captured manually by the Tamil Nadu Home (Transport) Department. Once the system is implemented, violations would be detected and e-challans would be automatically sent to owners of these vehicles.

Since face recognition would be part of the system, officials say it would also help investigating agencies solve other crimes. “With this unmanned automated system, which will work both during day and night conditions without manual intervention. It will definitely reduce the road accidents and improve the road manners of drivers. We are planning to install cameras in 56 locations between Chengalpattu and Tiruchi,” Transport Department officials said.

The government is aiming at an integrated system that would be able to capture the face of the driver in the speeding vehicle, which could also help in tracing stolen vehicles. The Transport Department is planning to rope in the Police Department and the National Highways in this project, which is expected to be implemented in the next few months. Offences such as not wearing seat belt, carrying passengers in goods vehicle, unauthorised parking on the roadside and non-renewal of FC and non-payment of tax would be included when indicated by this department from time to time. The integrated system would have a 3D Doppler radar and automatic number plate recognition cameras.

The project would be implemented through the Tamil Nadu Fibrenet Corporation Ltd (TANFINET). In a statement, he claimed that IAS officer Santhosh Babu, who functioned as the IT secretary was transferred, because he refused to cooperate with the government “in the scam”.

Mr. Stalin said when the issue was highlighted in a magazine, former Minister Thangam Thennarsu demanded transparency in tender procedures. “The pressure from the Chief Minister and the Minister of the department forced Mr. Santhosh Babu to opt for voluntary retirement service and I issued a statement for the need for protecting honest officials. What is the secret in the project that forced a senior official to seek VRS,” he asked.

Alleging that Mr. Santhosh Babu has been transferred and D. Ravichandran, an RDO, from Namakkal, the home district of Minister P. Thangamani, has been appointed as the Managing Director of the TANFINET, Mr. Stalin wondered if the government was not able to find a senior official to implement the Bharatnet project.

On behalf of the Chief Minister, the City Public Prosecutor filed the complaints before the Principal Sessions Court.

According to one complaint, Mr. Stalin questioned how the Centre adjudged Tamil Nadu as the leading State in the Good Governance Index. He also asked how the Centre was able to rank Tamil Nadu first in “public security”, when there were issues like the Pollachi rape cases, the killing of protesters during the Sterlite protests and the State being ranked second in the rape of minor girls.

The statement was published in DMK’s Murasoli newspaper on January 28.

In a counter affidavit filed before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, the department said the rituals and ceremonies would be conducted in accordance with agamas.

Further, the department said, most of the ancient temples, including the Thanjavur Big Temple, were built and all religious activities conducted as per agamas. The petitioners have not produced any proof as to why the event must be held in Tamil alone, it said.

In a similar counter affidavit filed by the Thanjavur Palace Devasthanam, it was submitted that Tamil ‘Thirumurais’ had occupied a predominant place in the pujas performed in the temple. There was no substance in the hue and cry raised by the petitioners and the devotees had not complained, as they were aware of the fact that Tamil occupied an important place.

216,2020/01/29,I-T Dept. withdraws three cases against actor Rajinikanth,"The Income Tax Department on Tuesday withdrew three tax case appeals preferred by it in 2014 against orders passed in favour of actor Rajinikanth by an Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), which set aside a penalty of ₹66.21 lakh imposed on him for allegedly concealing full particulars of income and providing inaccurate information.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar accepted a request made by M. Swaminathan, senior standing counsel for I-T Department, to withdraw the appeals in view of a decision taken by Central Board of Director Taxes (CBDT) to avoid litigation by dropping legal proceedings in claims where the recoverable amount was less than ₹1 crore.

In its pleadings before the court, the I-T Department stated that the “leading film actor” had disclosed ₹ 61.12 lakh, ₹1.75 crore and ₹33.93 lakh as his income for the years 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05 respectively. This was apart from ₹1.41 lakh and ₹ 1.09 lakh of his agricultural income disclosed in his returns for the financial years 2002-03 and 2004-05.

However, on studying the records, the department noticed that the actor had claimed a huge amount of professional expenditure in spite of disclosing “insignificant professional income.” Hence, a survey operation was carried out at his office premises, situated within his Poes Garden residence in Chennai, on February 7, 2005.

During the survey, it was found that not even one-tenth of the residential property ws devoted for professional purposes. Therefore, the actor was asked to substantiate the expenses claimed under various heads incurred towards his “negligible professional income admitted in the returns.”

After the survey operations, the assessee filed revised returns for all the three assessment years in question and claimed that he had earned more than what was disclosed in the original returns.

“The Assessing Officer recorded statements from the assessee and his employee and came to the conclusion that only 50% of expenditure incurred was for his professional activities and the other 50% of the expenses were incurred for his personal use.

Ample time given

“The Assessing Officer also observed that the assessee was given ample opportunity to substantiate his claim of expenses, but he did not avail the same and did not produce the necessary particulars. Only because of the survey could the department establish the correct income and hence the Assessing Officer invoked the penalty proceedigns and levied penaly of ₹ 6.20 lakh, ₹5.56 lakh and ₹54.45 lakh for the three assessment years under Section 27(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act,” the pleadings read. Aggrieved by the penalty, the actor preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals), who dismissed it on November 29, 2011 after holding that the assessee might not have offered excess income for tax but for the survey.

Nevertheless, when the actor went on further appeal to the ITAT, he won on July 26, 2013.

The ITAT held that penalty could not have been imposed merely on the basis of statements recorded from the actor and his employee without backing it up with material evidence or an investigation. The tribunal also ruled that estimation of expenditure by the actor in his original returns would not amount to concealment or furnishing of inaccurate particulars.

Assailing the ITAT’s order before the court, the I-T department claimed that the tribunal’s order was erroneous in law, as it had failed to appreciate that the assessee had filed revised returns only after the survey proceedings and so they could not be treated as revised returns filed voluntarily.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sb8gne/article30678691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHENNAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/i-t-dept-withdraws-three-cases-against-actor-rajinikanth/article30678692.ece

219,2020/01/29,Train commuters seek better last-mile connectivity,"Last-mile connectivity continues to be a major challenge for train commuters at most railway stations between Arakkonam and Katpadi junctions on the Chennai Central-Jolarpet section.

The train connectivity from Chitteri railway station in Arakkonam is poor allege rail commuters from the neighbouring villages. Commuters especially schoolchildren and office-goers from Asamandhur, Melkandigai, Keezhkandigai, Gandhi Nagar, Vedal, Thandalam also face difficulty to reach stations like Arakkonam, which is one of the biggest railway junctions.

Presently, there are six train services including passenger trains that touch down the station, but there are no services between 9 a.m. and noon and 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. to connect Arakkonam and Chitteri, points out G. Kumar, secretary of Chitteri to the Central Railway Station Passengers Association.

Schoolchildren had to wait for hours in Arakkonam junction and the road connectivity is too long for the commuters to locate alternate sources, he said.

Passengers association member from Chitteri railway station says autorickshaw drivers demand more money in the absence of effective connectivity. “The station is remotely located with no last-mile connectivity to any of the areas nearby,” he explains.

But thanks to the efforts of passengers association since passenger amenities are fast improving. We had sought stairs to connect all the platforms which railway officials have agreed upon. Trespassing on railway track continues during peak hours, but it needs to be avoided, points out Mr. Kumar.

Recently, the Southern Railway has rejected a plea to provide a stop for train number 16085 Arakkonam-Jolarpet MEMU and train number 66019/ 66020 Arakkonam-Salem Passenger citing reason as ‘not operationally feasible’.

“In this case we have pleaded the railways a couple of days ago to extend the Chennai Central-Arakkonam EMU service up to Chitteri, which would ease transport woes of these 10 villages around Chitteri,” said Mr. Kumar.

Pointing out that Section 41 of the Act stated that the orders passed under it by the Commissioner of Police could be in force only for 15 days, the petitioner’s counsel argued before Justice P.

Such orders curtailed the rights of the citizens to assemble at will and protest peacefully, he said.

She has not been paid salary so far and in addition to that is being ill treated. Within a short time of joining the job there, she came to know that she got unnecessarily tempted for high salary and has been deceived.

Belonging to Narayanagiri village in Dharmasagaram mandal of Warangal Urban district, she went to the Gulf country through an agent Ravikumar of Nizamabad district. In fact, the agent did not collect money from her and provided air ticket free of cost. She landed safely in that country and once into the job, her problems began.

She is sick and back home, her mother-in-law who is suffering from cancer is on her death bed. Her mother-in-law was fine when Sujatha went to Oman leaving behind her husband Ratnakar Reddy and daughter Sindhu who is studying degree final year in Vagdevi Degree College in Hanmakonda.

“The Sheikh who engaged my wife for work is not allowing her to travel back home besides not giving her salary. He is also not providing good food and healthcare to my wife who suffers chest pain often. As the agent told her that she would be getting an equivalent of ₹40,000 per month in addition to all other facilities, she was tempted to go to the distant place,” said Ratnakar, a car driver in a private firm.

Rao, who headed the expert committee to study overall development of Andhra Pradesh, including the capital, said here on Wednesday that the panel recommended Visakhapatnam as the best option as executive capital of the State.

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Rao said the committee considered northern most part of Visakhapatnam which was far away from the coast as the best place for the executive to function. A metro region which was not part of the city should be established for the purpose.

Similarly, the committee recommended Karnataka model of development zones, comprising Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam as Zone I with Visakhapatnam as headquarters, East and West Godavari and Krishna as Zone II with Eluru as headquarters, Guntur, Nellore and Prakasam as Zone III with Ongole as headquarters and Kurnool, Kadapa, Anantapur and Chittoor as Zone IV with Kadapa as headquarters. Executive powers of development should be vested with Zonal Commissioners of the rank of Special Chief Secretary.

Mr. Rao said it was with the objective of decentralised planning, development and execution that the committee decided Visakhapatnam as executive capital, Kurnool as judicial capital and Amaravati as legislative capital.

Development constraints

As part of the study, the committee discussed development constraints in Visakhapatnam, Machilipatnam and Vijayawada to caution policy matters. It came to a conclusion that Visakhapatnam was the best option for executive capital because it already had the required infrastructure and its selection would aid development of a vast tribal area.

The committee toured all over the State to gather public opinion, Mr. Rao said and dismissed apprehensions of cyclone threat to Visakhapatnam, oil spillage near the port and distance of travel between the three capitals which hindered their smooth functioning.

Mr. Narayana was the chief guest at the inaugural of a three-day national conference on Ambedkar and Ideological Journalism by the department of journalism, TU. He said that the Constitution was the inspiration for the nation and Articles 3, 10, 15 and 19, would help understand the evolution of the Indian society.

230,2020/01/29,Med Tech symposium held at IIT-H,"The Center for Healthcare Entrepreneurship of the Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H), had hosted a “Med Tech” symposium to bring together key leaders in the field of medical and healthcare technologies for a discussion on challenges and developments in the medical devices start-up ecosystem recently.

Panel discussions were held on topics such as Early Stage Funding, Medical Device Regulatory Aspects and Industry Perspective that will help start-ups in the domain, among others.

“A need was felt to usher in innovation and incubation culture in academic institutions. IIT-Hyderabad has always been progressive to address such needs. With strong research in biomedical engineering and members of faculty from other departments engaged in interdisciplinary research in allied areas, it was only appropriate to put identify healthcare as the theme for this endeavour,” said director of IIT-H B.S. Murty.

“The event was intended to connect IIT-H incubated start-ups with investors and venture capitalists in the healthcare technology sector. It was a great networking opportunity and created a lot of avenues for IIT-H start-ups. It also provided an exposure to the regulatory environment of the healthcare technology sector,” said head of operations, CfHE, U.B. Desai.

Speaking on “Foundation for CfHE: Inception and Activities”, director of CfHE Rajesh Mashruwala said: “A personal experience at the hospital long back threw light to the surprising fact that most of the hospital equipment, nearly 80 per cent, were imported. So, healthcare innovation seemed to be the key solution in providing affordable healthcare solutions to all in the country. Center for Healthcare Entrepreneurship was founded and funded with this goal”.

“New and emerging innovations, smartphone technologies and cloud computing are transforming healthcare into a model that is increasingly patient-centred and transparent. The digitalisation of healthcare and deep tech in healthcare space are the new innovation accelerators, catalysing a transition in the methods of healthcare delivery from the traditional hospital or office-based visitations to technology-based encounters that are virtual, on-demand, and patient-generated,” said MD ENDIYA Partners Ramesh Byrapaneni.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/med-tech-symposium-held-at-iit-h/article30685273.ece

234,2020/01/29,CM to tour districts after Assembly session,"Chief Minister (CM) K. Chandrasekhar Rao will tour districts in the State after the Assembly session which follows the Medaram jatara in Mulugu starting February 5, according to Endowment and Forest Minister A. Indrakaran Reddy. The CM will also visit Adilabad district to personally study the problem of tribals related with podu land and rights for cultivation on forest lands, the Minister revealed.

Addressing a gathering of Adivasis at the annual tribal darbar as part of the Keslapur Nagoba jatara celebrations, the Minister assured the tribals that Mr. Rao will ensure that no injustice will be done to them. “The CM will solve the problem once for all after going through it meticulously,” he said.

Harming tribals’ interests

Earlier, Adilabad MP Soyam Bapu Rao (BJP) had appealed to Mr. Reddy to stop the Forest Department from harming the interests of the aboriginal people in the name of protecting forests. He accused the department of forcibly evicting tribals from their agriculture fields.

Talking about development of the famous Nagoba Temple, about which the MP had made a fervent plea for completion of work on the new structure, the Minister in turn appealed to identify a contractor who can take up developmental work for which ₹ 5 crore has been sanctioned.

“Tenders have been called twice but no contractor has come forward to take up the work,” Mr. Reddy pointed out. Further, he said Keslapur has already seen development worth ₹ 11.6 crore including a double lane road connecting Mutnur with the temple.

Mr. Bapu Rao urged the government to take up a study to find the causes for anaemia among Adivasi women which has drastically reduced their life span. “An NGO had taken up a study which revealed that most ethnic women died around the age of 40 years,” he pointed ut.

Earlier, the Minister and others worshipped the serpent deity at the temple. Chairman of Sports Authority of Telangana State A. Venkateshwar Reddy, Collector D.

236,2020/01/29,The beauty of architectural transience,"Architecture is the ‘mother art’, that’s rarely given its due in the creative world. While blueprints and technical drawings are an integral part of designing and constructing a building, these are seen more as functional rather than artistic expressions. Vishwa Shroff, whose ongoing show Folly Measures explains her affinity by drawing a relationship between the built environment and its use. She says, “Architecture tends to collect like — marks, scratches, breaks, cracks, all of that. So it becomes apparent when you walk through any space that has been around for a while…you look at it and wonder why something happened.”

Shroff’s work draws the viewer in for its painstaking detail, whether it’s the almost evenly spaced lines for the entrance in ‘View from Room 208’ or the painstakingly minute dots that represent tiles that are a contrast to the burnished grey flooring of ‘As Time Goes by, 1’. Both these works on gallery’s upper level are in contrast to the ‘Partywall’, Shroff’s names for the partisan walls that she has captured in painstaking detail on the ground floor.

Intent and documentation

Speaking to Shroff it’s clear that intention, the reason behind any action forms the basis for the work. She differentiates the focus on architecture from the man-made marks found on trees because, “Marks happen on everything, but architecture in its conception is already intentional.” This carries through to Shroff’s decision to cut around each of her works, to highlight its intent and significance. She explains, “When you cut something out and put it away, that thing that has been put away is more emphasised because it’s been very intentionally removed from somewhere….it’s very intentionally that only a part of the building is removed and redrawn.”

Shroff’s intent carries through in her decision first to document ‘Partywall’ — painstaking reconstructions of the partition walls that she calls residual spaces, in which “a building has been knocked down and part of it is still visible;” for their layered approach. She elaborates, “It was built with intention, it been taken down with intention and this residue is also just there for a particular period of time.” When walking around the city, Shroff seeks out architecture that matches her criteria of: who, what, when, where and why.

About ‘Partywall’, she says, “The first one I did was London and the next one I did was Tokyo, and then I did one which was an interim series. London [has] a very particular way in which they preserve [the older structure] while construction is going on. With Tokyo what happened is they have two or three materials that they use, and I decided that I would make my palette fixed so as to have a series. Then that idea of having my own palette fixed got even more stringent because I was documenting from four different cities. Then it made more sense to make a series to negate the original materiality to give a hint of the textures that appear.”

Most of the work in Folly Measures is from Mumbai, though there are two works that document architecture in other cities. Shroff says, “Bombay is jarring! There is a lot of colour variation, so if I got it in all of that, it would be too much to see. You would pretty much feel like you’re standing outside and not able to abstract it to where your brain comprehends the idea of what it is.” And yet, Shroff’s work manages to capture the geometric beauty of old Bombay’s Minton tiled floors. There are also almost fantastical staircases that go nowhere – purposely taken out of the building in which they were built and reaching upwards, while staying trapped in its wooden frame.

Fresh experiments

The thought-provoking and sometimes irreverent artist, has also created a new series of 16 prints. In this, she says, “I’ve attempted mapping people within space, and how really, physically we move within one space versus kind of just observing what the materiality of the space is.” The work, called ‘Everyday Rosella’ maps where she and her friend Rosella stand within Shroff’s home over a 10-day period. She adds, “I realised basically we are little ping pongs. But what I did realise is that I lean against walls a bit too much.”

237,2020/01/29,Dancing with letters,"Watching the Italian penwoman Barbara Calzolari at work is like witnessing a tightly choreographed dance sequence. With lithe movements of the nib held in the flange of an oblique calligraphy pen, she creates a rhythm of thin, slant strokes. Calzolari connects them with crisp swirls to the tune of an Italian song playing in the background. And before you know it, the letters ‘P’, ‘R’ and ‘B’ have liven up the blank page.

Pen maestro

“My mother would say that I’m too fat to be a dancer. But I can dance with these letters,” laughs Calzolari, 56, who is the first woman in Europe and among only 12 individuals in the world to hold the title of ‘Master Penman’. She was awarded in 2015 by the International Association of Master Penman, Engrossers, and Teachers of Handwriting (IAMPETH), the oldest and largest penmanship organisation in the United States. Visiting Mumbai for the first time, Calzolari will participate in ‘The Ink Tank’, a panel discussion on calligraphy and lettering’s commercial application and future. The panelists include master calligrapher Achyut Palav, typographer Chandan Mahimkar and Sanjana Chatlani, founder of The Bombay Lettering Company, who learnt from the artist and has flown her in to conduct workshops too.

Reviving traditions

“Around the world, there’s a revival in the interest of calligraphy. I’m seeing that in India too,” says Calzolari, highlighting the diverse audience that’s part of her workshops – from 18 to 54-year-olds from Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Delhi, Jaipur and Rajkot. “It’s because calligraphy is the easiest form of expression through art. We don’t have time to use our hands for things that require a lot of effort, like, building a house from scratch or embroidery. Calligraphy also offers a personalised touch that even commercial brands want today.” She connects calligraphy with the mind. “If you write in block letters, your thoughts will feel blocked and if you write in cursive, you’ll find coherence in your thoughts too.”

Practising this art for three decades, Calzolari has worked for Pope Benedict XVI; made copies of the Italian-born queen of France Catherine de’ Medici’s book of letters “written in archaic Italian, French and Latin”, and also designed copies of the national anthems that were presented as souvenirs by the prime minister of Italy to the assembled leaders at the G8 summit in 2009.

“Russian and Japanese anthems were challenging to write because the alphabets were totally different,” she says. “I received interesting questions from the guests. German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked me the name of the ink.”

Passion for words

Bologna-born Calzolari started her career as a designer in the fashion industry. Her interest in calligraphy sparked from copying English poems in books to learn the language because, “It was important for designers to know English. So, I started thinking about how poets must have written them originally.” Later, she quit her job to pursue her passion. “I learnt calligraphy before the age of Instagram [where you can post and get feedback]. So, I would often doubt myself,” she says.

Calzolari specialises in the European Copperplate style of calligraphy and the American Spencerian script, which was widely used for official correspondence in the US in the 19th century. The difference lies in the thickness and shading. She learnt Spencerian under the guidance of American expert Michael Sull. A Master Penman himself, he encouraged her to attain the title. For that, the inductee needed to produce their own certificate as proof of ability. Calzolari used eight scripts on her certificate and received a unanimous vote of approval from the other title holders. “I feel honoured but a certificate alone isn’t enough. It’s what you do every day that matters. You fight with the paper every day and wonder, ‘Will it follow what I have in mind today?’,” she says.

238,2020/01/29,Versions and layers,"Apart from the big battle between cousins in The Mahabharata, the epic is peppered with many subplots. “These stories are open to interpretation,” says theatre coach and storyteller Aparna Jaishankar.

Looking at the Mahabharata beyond mythology, Aparna says, “We see aspects of the Mahabharata happening in our lives every day, be it in our conversations or our rituals. I try to bring this connection into my storytelling.”

The Mahabharata is close to Aparna, who gave up her corporate job five years ago to tell stories. “I have done at least 70 sessions of storytelling from the Mahabharata. The epic canvas is interesting. There is no one story to Mahabharata. The novelty lies in the different versions. As is often said, ‘Every 100 kilometres in a village, one can find a new Ramayana, and for every Ramayana, there are a hundred Mahabharatas.”

Aparna has read C Rajagopalachari’s well-known version and is familiar with BR Chopra’s televised one. “I couldn’t find many books on the epic. I have read translations of different versions and from many regions across India.”

Aparna will focus on Duryodhana and Gandhaari. “We will reflect on their characters and their choices.” A version in one of the villages in interior Andhra Pradesh, has Gandhaari pouring hot water as she strains cooked rice on a colony of ants, killing many ants, which invites a curse from the head ant. In Odhisa there is a story of Gandhaari playing with pebbles on a beach. A turtle says she destroyed the eggs, inviting its wrath.

In the case of Duryodhana, his wife Bhanumathi, thinks the world of him. In many versions Duryodhana is not portrayed as a villain at all and there are temples dedicated to him in Kerala and Himachal Pradesh. “One’s viewpoint and the way one chooses to take the narration forward makes a difference to how the story is understood and perceived. One can look at Bhanumathi’s viewpoint as being formed because she led a sheltered life and got information only from Duryodhana. These are viewpoints we will highlight to help the audience think deeper.”

Though Aparna grew up listening to stories from the epics from elders in the house, she rues the fact that the tradition is no more a part of every household. “The oral tradition, which was part of our life, is slowly dying out as we don’t have people to tell stories and there isn’t anyone listening to them either.”

Aparna, co-member of the Bangalore Storytelling Society, studied Social Work from Bharathiar University and did a post-graduate diploma in HR. After a decade of working in the corporate sector, her passion for performing arts made her take up theatre coaching and storytelling under her brand kAhini – What’s your story?

239,2020/01/29,ULFA(I) chief refuses to budge on sovereignty issue for talks,"Paresh Baruah, elusive military chief of the United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I), has refused to budge from his primary condition for accepting New Delhi’s offer for talks — the inclusion of the sovereignty of Assam in the agenda of discussion.

The ULFA-I leader, believed to be based out of the Ruili area on the China-Myanmar border, set his terms in reaction to the olive branch the Centre offered to the outfit after signing the third Bodo Peace Accord with all factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB).

Mr. Baruah has stuck to the issue of sovereignty since 2002 when music maestro, the late Bhupen Hazarika, had offered to mediate for the Centre and the then undivided outfit. He backed out of a similar initiative in 2005 after the Centre made it clear that any issue other than sovereignty could be discussed.

On Tuesday, Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma requested Mr. Baruah and his group to come to the talks table for resolving the 41-year-old armed movement. The ULFA was formed in April 1979, a few months before the anti-foreigners Assam agitation began.

“We can send a delegation for talks if the government of India gives it in black and white that the issue of sovereignty of Assam would be discussed,” Mr. Baruah said, pointing out that discussing the issue does not mean granting sovereignty.

‘Discussion in Assam’

In a statement, he also said any discussion must be held in Assam, not in New Delhi or anywhere else in India and members of his group must not be treated as a colonial power treats the colonised.

Mr. Baruah welcomed the Bodo Accord for being signed without compromising the territorial integrity of Assam.

The Assam government said the members of the NDFB would be surrendering before Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal at an official ceremony in Guwahati on Thursday. A week ago, 644 extremists belonging to eight armed groups had given up arms.

241,2020/01/29,Modified kilns protect potters from toxic fumes,"A technical intervention in the fabrication of pottery kilns has come to the aid of the ‘Kumhar’ (potter) community in Rajasthan’s Bharatpur district by ensuring protection against toxic fumes, consumption of lesser amount of fuel and high production of earthen pots and utensils. The modified furnace has been installed in Unch village of Nadbai tehsil.

Potters belonging to the Prajapat clan have traditionally been fabricating kilns of mud and clay and using tudi, made of vestiges of mustard crop, as fuel for heating these furnaces. The round-shaped kilns produce smoke and fumes in huge quantity as well as high flames caused by baking of earthen pots.

Bharatpur-based Lupin Foundation has taken an initiative for improvement in conventional kilns with the assistance of the Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG) at Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi. The RuTAG takes up modification of existing technology and redesigns gadgets for adoption by the users at the grassroots.

RuTAG’s senior project assistant Davinder Pal Singh told The Hindu on Wednesday that the masonry method of “rat trap construction” was used for fabrication of kilns, in which the bricks were placed in vertical position instead of the conventional horizontal order, creating hollow space within the wall.

Similar initiative

“The insulation created in this manner traps heat in the furnace and reduces fuel consumption by 60%. The results are very encouraging...

At a meeting convened by the Chief Minister to discuss budget proposals for the next fiscal and various issues pending with the Centre, the Members of both Houses of Parliament decided that the Chief Minister should press upon the Prime Minister the dangers of accepting the Agriculture Price Commission’s recommendation.

Any change in MSP procurement policy will adversely impact Punjab’s economy, they felt, expressing the fear that the Centre would limit procurement as the first step towards putting an end to MSP purchase.

Key issues

An official statement said, among the other key issues of Punjab’s interest pending with the Centre, that came up for discussion during the meeting, were Punjab’s demand for compensation of ₹100 per quintal to farmers for zero burning of paddy residue, reduction of tax rate for dairy cooperatives, and exemption of dairy products from free trade negotiations.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3xrxg9/article30686826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29-AMARINDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/price-panels-report-a-serious-threat-to-farmers/article30686827.ece
243,2020/01/29,Yellow rust in wheat crop causes alarm in Punjab and Haryana,"The detection of yellow rust disease in the wheat crop in sub-mountainous parts of Punjab and Haryana has raised anxiety among farmers about drop in the crop's yield even as respective agriculture departments are leaving nothing to chance to ensure the spread of the disease doesn't go beyond control.

Agriculture officials from both the States have fanned out to fields suggesting farmers to adopt remedial measures to deal with the situation. In Punjab, yellow rust has been reported in a few villages of Ropar, Hoshiarpur and Pathankot districts. In Haryana, it has been detected in the wheat crop in a few villages of Panchkula, Yamunanagar and Ambala districts.

Drop in productivity

Yellow rust is a fungal disease which turns the crop's leaves into a yellowish colour and stops photosynthesis activity, which eventually could result in a drop of wheat crop productivity.

“We have received reports of yellow rust in wheat crop in a few villages of Ropar, Pathankot and Anandpur Sahib districts. It's in a very limited area that the crop has been affected as of now, but we are not taking any chances. Our team of experts has hit the fields to monitor the situation. However, at this stage it's not threatening,” Sutantar Airi, Director Punjab's Agriculture Department, told The Hindu.

The minimum temperature have been hovering around 1.6 to 3.0 degree Celsius above normal at many places in parts of Punjab during the past few days.

“After rain in the past few days, the minimum temperature had risen a bit, coupled with slightly humid conditions. However, in the next 3-4 days the minimum temperature is likely to dip,” said Surinder Pal, Director, India Meteorological Department, Chandigarh.

Pargat Singh, chief patron (Ropar) of Bhartiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur), who has sown wheat in his nearly 14-acre farm, said farmers in the region are worried as reports of yellow rust attack have emerged. “It can't be ignored as it can spread quickly and can cause severe losses in crop yield if not checked in time,” he said, adding that government should remain in a constant state of vigil to control the situation.

Wheat, the main rabi (winter) crop, is sown between late October till December while the harvesting of the crop will start from April onwards.

‘Follow advisory’

244,2020/01/29,Haryana rights panel dismisses plea against compensation order,"Turning down a Haryana government petition seeking a review of its order to grant ₹15,000 compensation each to two brothers who were disrobed by the police in lock-up, the Haryana Human Rights Commission clarified that the act was a violation of an individual’s human rights.

Hearing a plea by Gohana resident Suresh Kumar, the commission had in its order on February 26 last year found two police officers guilty of illegally taking him and his brother Balraj under preventive arrest, beating them up and disrobing them inside the lock-up. Holding the government responsible for the act of the two officers, the panel had recommended that the government pay ₹15,000 each to the victims.

Mr. Kumar had approached the commission in 2015 alleging that the then Station House Officer, City Gohana police station, Satyender Kumar, and Assistant Sub-Inspector Dayanand had illegally arrested them when they had gone to the police station along with a few locals after the two police officers allegedly refused to register a case on the complaint of one Sanjeev Kumar.

Replying to the commission’s order, the Superintendent of Police, Sonipat, had said that there had been instances in the past when some accused had attempted to kill themselves inside the lock-up with their clothes and belts and hence, Suresh and Balraj were disrobed to prevent any such possibility.

Review plea

The Additional Chief Secretary, Home, in view of the SP’s reply, had sought a review of the commission’s order. The commission, however, took a strong exception to the plea saying: “The plea raised by the Superintendent of Police, Sonipat, is against human dignity and if any such act is being carried out by police officers under his jurisdiction or anywhere in Haryana then the said act of the police officers can be inferred as violation of a human right. No suspect/accused can be forced to take off their clothes and stand naked in the lock-up.”

“It is sad to note that a plea, which is against the dignity and honour of an individual, is made by the Superintendent of Police, which is not at all appreciable by the commission,” said the commission while dismissing the review petition.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/haryana-rights-panel-dismisses-plea-against-compensation-order/article30686815.ece
245,2020/01/29,AMU V-C makes fresh appeal to students to appear in exams,"The Aligarh Muslim University Vice-Chancellor, Tariq Mansoor, made a fresh and final appeal to students to appear in the examinations and attend classes on Wednesday.

“I appeal to all my students whose future is foremost on my mind, not to fall prey to rumours, propaganda spread by vested interests and to appear in the examinations and attend classes,” said Prof. Mansoor in a statement released by the public relations department of the university.

The university was shut down on December 15, a week ahead of schedule, when police entered the campus to control the students protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and police action in Jamia Millia Islamia. The university reopened on January 13 in a phased manner but a large number of students are boycotting classes and exams since then.

Prof. Mansoor added that the university cannot allow chaos, disorder and undesirable activities which would tarnish the name of the university.

“If the examination and classes are prevented from being held by some misguided elements there will be no justification of keeping the university open and allowing 23, 000 students to sit idle in the campus,” pointed out Prof. Mansoor, adding that even the parents of students would not want their wards to remain on the campus without academic activity and law and order issues could also arise.

He categorically stated, “This is my last appeal to all, to maintain peace and tranquillity in the campus and to please appear in the exams and attend classes from January 30, 2020. Already 18 days have gone by without any academic activity.”

The Vice-Chancellor said that the university has already constituted two committees to look into various issues.

‘Incidents being probed’

He reminded, “The incidents of December 15 are being investigated by National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on the orders of Hon’ble High Court of Allahabad and the next hearing is scheduled in Allahabad High Court for February 17. Let us wait for its decision.”

However, Salman Imtiaz, president, Aligarh Muslim University Students’ Union (2018-19), strongly condemned the V-C’s statement. “The AMUSU condemns false accusations against AMU students. We want to tell the nation that no misguided persons or outsiders are protesting on the campus,” countered Mr. Imtiaz.

Later in the evening, in what is being described as a last-ditch effort, Prof. Mansoor engaged with around 200 students in the engineering faculty but the discussion remained “inconclusive”, according to a source. A student, requesting anonymity, said the V-C continued to deflect or not answer difficult questions.

Meanwhile, the District Magistrate and the Senior Superintendent of Police of Aligarh called on the V-C on Wednesday. Sources said, after the Sharjeel Imam episode, the district administration was putting pressure on the V-C to announce a sine die.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dagqoz/article30686804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29-AMU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amu-v-c-makes-fresh-appeal-to-students-to-appear-in-exams/article30686805.ece

247,2020/01/29,Two dead in Murshidabad during anti-CAA protest,"At least two people were killed in a clash between two groups in Sahebnagar village of Jalangi block in Murshidabad district on Wednesday morning. One of the persons killed in the clash was identified as Anarul Biswas, 55, locals told The Hindu. Mr. Biswas was a muezzin (prayer caller) in the local mosque. The other person is identified as Salauddin, in his 20s. Three persons have been admitted in local hospitals, while three persons have been taken into custody.

‘Backed by all’

A Murshidabad-based citizen’s forum gave a bandh call in Murshidabad, a Muslim majority district, extending support to the national bandh of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board on Wednesday, challenging the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Murshidabad district committee member of the Communist Party of India-Marxist Unus Ali Sarkar, also a former MLA, said that people “irrespective of their political affiliation backed the bandh”.

The bandh backers were observing a sit-in at Sahebnagar market when local Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Tahiruddin Mondal arrived with his associates in a few vehicles. The TMC team came to “disperse the crowd”, said Mr. Sarkar. An eminent local journalist, not affiliated to any political party, said that the protesters “first attacked the TMC supporters” after an altercation. Mr. Mondal’s brother Mantu Mondal received bullet injuries. Later, the TMC team returned and allegedly opened fire on the protesters, killing two.

TMC’s position

Jalangi block president of the Congress Abdul Rezzak Mollah argued that if the bandh backers were to be dispersed, then “the administration should have done it”.

“When the TMC is opposing CAA, why is its leader randomly opening fire on innocent protesters?” he asked. The Bharatiya Janata Party too called it a “crisis of governance”.

TMC’s secretary general Partha Chatterjee refuted allegations. “Why should we resist an anti-CAA protest, if TMC is opposing it? One of our persons is shot. We need to find out who is going to gain from this violence,” Mr. Chatterjee said.

A civil society group, Bangla Sanskriti Mancha, quickly raised an alarm addressing the crisis on Wednesday morning. The Mancha’s president Samirul Islam said “police acted fast, averting flare up”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1whbbg/article30687918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TH-THGRP-BENGALjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2-dead-in-murshidabad-during-anti-caa-protest/article30683612.ece
248,2020/01/29,Vigilante form of Inner Line Permit being enforced in Meghalaya,"Meghalaya is yet to come under the Inner Line Permit (ILP) regime unlike Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, but that has not stopped a local organisation from “implementing” the British-era permit’s vigilante version.

Issued under the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873 by the State governments concerned, the ILP is an official travel document allowing inward travel of an Indian citizen to a protected area for a limited period.

Protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) had made the Meghalaya Assembly – the BJP is a minor partner in the alliance government headed by the National People’s Party – adopt a resolution in favour of ILP in December 2019. But officials are awaiting a meeting with the Ministry of Home Affairs to take the issue forward.

The sub-nationalist Hynniewtrep Youth Council (HYC) has, however, claimed that it used its own ILP to catch at least 100 people from Assam who entered Meghalaya without valid documents.

“Our members checked these people at Bhoirymbong (Ri-Bhoi district) on Monday and found them to be illegal migrants who came to Meghalaya for work,” HYC’s vice-president Donboklang Kharlyngdoh said.

Appreciating the locals for their vigilantism that helped them locate the “illegal migrants”, Mr. Kharlyngdoh justified the “unauthorised” checking of documents. “We will take the law in our hands if the government continues to delay the inevitable,” he said.

Police in Ri-Bhoi district declined to comment and only said “we shall look into it”.

ILP has been in force in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Nagaland since their creation. The other north-eastern States demanded this regulation as a mechanism to counter public anger against the CAA.

249,2020/01/29,"8 killed, 40 injured as bus falls into ditch in Odisha","Eight people, including six women, were killed and around 40 injured when a passenger bus skidded off and toppled down from a small bridge at the Taptapani ghat road in Odisha’s Ganjam district in the early hours of Wednesday.

The bus was travelling to Berhampur from Tikri in Rayagada district. At 3.30 a.m., while negotiating a turn, the bus went off the bridge on a stream near Palukhalo and fell into a 30 feet ditch. It overturned while hitting the hard ground.

Some survivors claimed that just before the accident, they heard the driver shouting that the brakes had failed. According to Ganjam District Collector Vijay Amruta Kulange, low visibility due to dense fog was also a reason behind this accident.

Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik expressed deep grief over the loss of lives in the accident and announced an ex-gratia of ₹2 lakh each to next of the kin of the deceased.

Around 27 seriously injured were admitted in the MKCG medical college and hospital, while those with minor injuries were discharged after first aid.

“Superintendent engineer of the National Highways Authority of India, posted in Berhampur, has been directed to make a survey of the accident spot and adjoining areas to ascertain the possibility of any engineering defect in road construction in the region that leads to accidents. He will file a report in two days”, said the Collector.

On receiving information, police and fire service personnel rushed to the spot. Four fire brigade teams from Berhampur, Digaphandi, Sanakhemundi and Mohana were involved in the rescue operation. Gas cutters were used to take out the last injured woman who was stuck inside the bus for over four hours. The place where the bus fell was surrounded by water and was in hilly forest terrain, which hampered the rescue operation.

The deceased included Sanghamitra Mohapatra (40) and her 12-year-old daughter Anwesha Mohapatra from Rayagada town. They were on their way to Bhubaneswar via Berhampur to attend a family feast. Karishma Nayak (35), a teacher posted in Rayagada district met her last while returning to her home in Kavisuryanagar block of Ganjam district. A 13- member family group from Potabagada village of Ganjam district was returning back from Rayagada in the bus. Jhunu Behera (35) of this group died, while the rest were injured. The other women killed were Subasini Moharana (34) of Ganjam district and Bidyut Nayak (46) of Rayagada district. The two men who died were Sunil Nayak (32) and Ramesh Behera (49) of Ganjam district.

252,2020/01/29,Odisha government reaches out to villagers of Swabhiman Anchal,"The Malkangiri district administration has come out to provide all support and security to villagers of Swabhiman Anchal in Odisha who opposed the diktat of Maoists to oppose development works and road construction.

To express their wrath, Maoists had torched 10 houses and seven bikes at Jodambo of Swabhiman Anchal on January 26. On January 27, Malkangiri Collector Manish Agarwal and Superintendent of Police Khilari Rishikesh Dnyandeo visited the camp of the Border Security Force at Hantalguda and held discussions with families of victims.

Rice promised

The Collector assured that each victim’s family would be provided a new house under the Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana and ₹30,000 from the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Each family will also get 50 kg of rice and free cooked food for a week. The Collector also provided ₹3000 to each of these families for day-to-day expenses.

According to the SP, residents of Jodambo, Badapada, Paparmetla panchayats, who were earlier supporting Maoists out of fear, have started realising the importance of government initiatives for road connectivity and development projects, which are opposed by Naxals. On January 25 night, an armed Maoist was killed and another was seriously injured when Janturai villagers in Jodambo panchayat bravely retaliated against a group of armed Maoists, who had come to terrorise the villagers asking them to oppose road construction. As a revenge, the Naxalites had resorted to arson at Jodambo.

Security up

To safeguard villagers of these panchayats from Maoist violence, security had been heightened in the area.

Improvement in communication, benefits of development projects of the State government and increased penetration of security forces have turned the villagers against the Maoists. Increased area domination by the security forces has facilitated public delivery system. “These villagers now feel that after 70 years of Independence they should no more remain underdeveloped and should not use mules for their transportation only because Maoists oppose road communication and development,” said Deputy Inspector General of Police, South-West Range, Shefeen Ahmed. K.

‘Operation Swabhiman’

From January 12, security forces had taken up ‘Operation Swabhiman’ for five days to enable ghat cutting work for around 9 km from Hantalguda to Jodambo, which will help in enhancing road connectivity within Swabhiman Anchal. While the locals are enthusiastic about this enhancement in communication, Maoists oppose it.

Lack of road communication with mainland Odisha had kept Swabhiman Anchal, the erstwhile cut off area of Balimela reservoir underdeveloped and a safe haven for Maoists for decades. The Gurupriya bridge connected this cut off area with Odisha mainland in 2018. The State government had initiated a special package for the development of Swabhiman Anchal.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/odisha-government-reaches-out-to-villagers-of-swabhiman-anchal/article30679180.ece
253,2020/01/29,"Over 30,000 Dalits, Adivasis hold dharna in Khargone against Citizenship Amendment Act","More than 30,000 Dalits and Adivasis held a dharna opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at the anaj mandi (grain market) in Khargone in southern Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday, urging the Centre to withdraw the contentious law and asking the State government to pass a resolution against it.

“Should we leave the fate of our citizenship in the hands of a government that is casteist and communal?” asked Madhuri Krishnaswamy of the Jagrit Adivasi Dalit Sangathan, addressing the protest rally. “The Centre is inflicting attack after attack on its citizens. Is this what we choose a government for?”

On the second day of protests against the law, the proposed nationwide implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) in Madhya Pradesh’s Nimar region, the Dalit and Advisasi groups made clear that they were in no mood to relent.

“Until the NPR and the NRC is stopped in its tracks, our movement will continue to grow stronger,” said Ms. Krishnaswamy.

Addressing the protesters, Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav said, “Any other Prime Minister would be proud to see the Constitution’s Preamble being read out and the Tricolour being carried in protests across the country today, but unfortunately, not our Prime Minister.”

Sunil Astay of the Bhim Army said Dalits would stand alongside Adivasis throughout the movement. “We will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our brothers.”

Elaborating on the plight of those left out of the NRC in Assam, social worker Harsh Mander said several clerical errors, such as spelling mistakes, had sent citizens straight to detention centres. He also reminded the protesters of the heritage of peace and harmony that people across the country shared and which needed to be preserved.

Gyaani Bai, a protester said, “The BJP government at the Centre should be ashamed. After begging us for votes and saying Har har Modi, Ghar ghar Modi, they are asking for proof of citizenship.”

Contending that while the party had got votes from the people, but had only worked for the benefit of corporates, she asserted, “As for us, you only seek to divide us in the name of caste and religion; there is nothing greater than humanity, and we do not want this law”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qncuix/article30678619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-01-28-at-54346-PM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dalits-adivasis-hold-dharna-in-khargone-against-citizenship-amendment-act/article30678620.ece

255,2020/01/29,4 held for smuggling dogs for meat in Tripura,"Police arrested four members of a dog smuggling racket after intercepting a vehicle at Ambassa in north Tripura on Monday. They found eight dogs concealed in the vehicle’s luggage space.

The detainees, aged between 19 and 25, are believed to have been transporting the dogs to a location close to Mizoram. They were arrested under provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.

“They have confessed to being in the dog smuggling racket for over a year,” a police officer told The Hindu by phone on Tuesday from Ambassa. He said dog meat was common in Mizoram, as in Nagaland. There had been a few such detentions and recoveries in Tripura recently, he said.

Lucrative business

Police officials said sale of dogs to agents from Mizoram and Nagaland had become a lucrative business in Tripura over past two years. This was because of insufficient supply in these north-eastern States where dog meat is a delicacy.

Street dogs have almost disappeared from places close to the boundary with Mizoram and many other interior locations of the State. “Racketeers have even started breeding dogs like poultry in some remote places. They are doing it in the guise of domestication centres,” an official said.

Sources said a dog fetches up to ₹3000 in the market, thus attracting many to join the business.

256,2020/01/29,"In Santiniketan, demonstration by students, meeting by teachers","On Monday, a group of students of the Visva-Bharati University held a noisy demonstration demanding the resignation of Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty, while a general body meeting of the teachers’ union condemned the “high-handed” behaviour of the authorities.

The countdown to the centenary of the university, founded by Rabindranath Tagore in 1921, is likely to be marked with what’s turning out to be a long-drawn confrontation between the authorities and Left-wing student leaders who appear to have the sympathy of a section of teachers.

‘Heavy security’

“We wanted to take out a big procession to the central office but found the place under heavy security. They have declared it a no-disturbance zone. So we held a demonstration at the Upasana Griha and shouted slogans,” said Falguni Pan, one of the student leaders.

These students accuse the Vice-Chancellor of turning Visva-Bharati into a Right-wing institution and also for inciting the violence that broke out in the campus on January 15, when some students belonging to Left-wing organisations were injured in an attack by a rival group. The university has rejected both allegations.

The violence followed anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests on the campus and a lecture on the CAA delivered by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ideologue Swapan Dasgupta, who was locked up in the hall for several hours by protesting students.

“We will continue our agitation because we are concerned about the future of the students at Visva-Bharati. We will resist all attempts to saffronise the university,” said Mr. Pan.

‘Made scapegoat’

Meanwhile, the teacher’s union, the Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association (VBUFA), which has over 300 members, said that it was being made a scapegoat for the ongoing trouble on the campus, even though it has not openly or actively supported the agitating students.

“On January 15, our office was locked up. This, in spite of a notification issued in November last year, recognising us as a voluntary organisation. The Vice-Chancellor has clearly made us a scapegoat for his mismanagement,” VBUFA president Sudipta Bhattacharyya said.

“The general body meeting condemned the closure of our office. It also condemned the high-handed manner in which the Vice-Chancellor is functioning,” Mr. Bhattacharyya alleged.

Where the agitations are going to lead remains to be seen, but Santiniketan appears to be fast turning into a fertile ground for a confrontation between Left and Right wing groups, and a place whose name is synonymous with peace looks set to witness more noisy demonstrations.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/in-santiniketan-demonstration-by-students-meeting-by-teachers/article30678462.ece
257,2020/01/29,"Bodos jubilant, other communities miffed","The third Bodo Accord since 1993, signed on Monday to end the demand for a separate State or Union Territory for the Bodo community, evoked jubilation and despondency in Assam, primarily across the Bodoland Territorial Areas District (BTAD).

The State government allayed the fears of some 20 non-Bodo communities living in BTAD, pointing out that the “historic accord” has a lot to offer for them besides the Bodos, the largest plains tribe in the northeast.

The Bodos began celebrating soon after the Centre signed the accord with all factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB), the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU) and others on Monday afternoon. They distributed sweets, burst firecrackers and sang and danced late into the night.

“This is a historic accord signed keeping in mind the interests of all communities living in the BTAD. I don’t think it has room for any complaint,” Rajya Sabha member Biswajit Daimary said at a public function in Chirang, one of the four districts in the BTAD.

Grand reception

Thousands of Bodos from the BTAD areas had earlier in the day thronged the Guwahati airport to receive the leaders of the extremist and civil society groups who signed the accord.

ABSU president Promod Bodo seconded Mr. Daimary, saying the accord was inclusive and would ensure lasting peace in the BTAD that had been torn apart by four decades of violence and ethnic conflicts.

But the non-Bodos said the accord did not have anything positive for them. “We are not against the peace process but this accord has ignored the interests of the other ethnic communities in the area. In fact, the government has repeated the mistakes made during the signing of the BTC (Bodoland Territorial Council) Accord,” said Naba Kumar Sarania, the independent Lok Sabha member from Kokrajhar constituency in the BTAD.

The BTC governs the BTAD. This council was formed after the second Bodo accord in 2003, replacing the Bodoland Autonomous Council that the first accord in 1993 offered. Monday’s accord renamed the BTC as the Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) with more administrative and fiscal powers.

Mr. Sarania, a non-Bodo, retained his Parliament seat on the strength of the non-Bodo votes who together account for 70% of the population in the BTAD.

‘Rights of non-Bodos ignored’

Hiteswar Barman, adviser to the All Koch-Rajbongshi Students’ Union, put the non-Bodo population at 73%. “In pleasing 27% of people, the Centre ignored the political, social and economic rights of the non-Bodos in BTAD,” he said.

Ibrahim Ali Ahmed, the working president of the All Bodo Minority Students’ Union, foresaw doom for the non-tribal people. “It is unfortunate that the non-tribal stakeholders were kept in the dark about this accord. We are not optimistic as the 2003 accord did not prevent injustice to the non-tribal people,” he said.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said the pact has balanced the aspirations of everyone in BTR and adjoining areas. “The peace accord keeps the territorial integrity of Assam intact. All the clauses will be executed with the support of all stakeholders and no community living in the State should be worried about the pact,” he said.

Assam Finance and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma insisted the accord will bring peace between the Bodos and non-Bodos as there are provisions for exclusion of areas dominated by non-Bodos from the BTR and inclusion of tribal-dominated areas in the council.

Officials, however, are wary of complications in the hills of central Assam far from the BTAD because of the provision in the accord giving Scheduled Tribe (Hills) status to the Bodos living in Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong districts.

“The Bodos are from the plains and they are enjoying the status of ST.

258,2020/01/29,Indo-Tibetan Border Police flags delay in Central Public Works Department construction projects,"The chief of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) flagged the delays in the construction of facilities for its personnel, while pointing to the speed of construction in China, at a recent review meeting with Central Public Works Department (CPWD) officials here.

ITBP Director-General S.S. Deswal cited the example of China, which, he said, constructs almost “one floor per week”, while 59% of the ITBP projects being carried out by the CPWD, the government’s construction agency, were running behind schedule, according to the minutes of the January 3 meeting issued on Monday.

An official of the ITBP, the primary force deployed along the Line of Actual Control with China, said at the meeting that 146 projects, at a total cost of ₹1,679.76 crore, had been sanctioned and were being implemented at various locations in the country. “Out of 146 works, 87 works/projects are running behind schedule, among which 13 are delayed by more than two years. For example, the work on the renovation of the quarters at Faridabad is delayed by more than two years,” the document read.

Mr. Deswal highlighted the issue of some projects that were “inordinately delayed”, but should not be. “We are a very, very progressive country. If a project is delayed, the country’s development gets delayed. When we see around in different countries, the construction is done at a very, very fast pace, whether we go to Gulf [West Asia] or we go to China. China almost constructs one floor per week and their speed of construction of building is very, very fast. The CPWD is requested to evolve some new systems so that the projects are completed in time,” the minutes cited Mr. Deswal as saying.

He also pointed to the pace of construction in Qatar for the upcoming football World Cup. Meanwhile, a CPWD official “demanded that additional funds be allocated by ITBP”, the minutes said. The construction agency was asked to complete by March 31 the 13 projects that were delayed by over two years.

Infrastructure in the Northeast

Among projects in the northeastern region, the CPWD informed the ITBP of the completion dates for seven works, including the construction of barracks and quarters, between March and December. Thirty-seven projects were 75%-99% complete, ITBP officials said, asking that they be handed over by March-end. ITBP officials also informed the CPWD of cost overruns in 16 projects.

Responding to a CPWD official asking for additional funds in “some cases”, “the ITBP informed that MHA [the Ministry of Home Affairs] has issued sanction on 2-3-year-old estimates without updating the estimate with the present cost index and therefore the divisions are facing a lot of problem in completing the work within sanctioned amount (sic).”

CPWD Director-General Prabhakar Singh said many sanctions issued by the Central police forces in the past two to three years were based on the detailed/preliminary estimate “without having proper provisions for development works and furniture etc,” the minutes said. “As a result, it has been found that the quarters are ready, but could not be used because there is no provision of road, STP [sewage treatment plant], street lights, external electric connection etc.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/indo-tibetan-border-police-flags-delay-in-central-public-works-department-construction-projects/article30678248.ece

Punjab Health Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Tuesday told The Hindu that so far not a single positive case of coronavirus has been detected in the State, although two of the 16 persons have been hospitalised.

“In all, 16 people from Punjab had in the recent past travelled to China. Out of them, two have been admitted to hospitals, one at the Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh and the other at Fortis in Mohali. Both are under observation and their blood samples etc. have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune,” said Mr. Sidhu.

“Their reports are expected by tomorrow. So far there is no positive case of the virus in Punjab,” he said.

Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij said that no case of coronavirus has been reported so far in the State. However, as a precautionary measures, directions have been given to the district hospitals to make separate wards and to ensure proper treatment and sufficient supply of medicines. “Although Haryana has not yet reported any case of coronavirus, however, during the month of January, five people came from China and their medical examination is under process,” he said

“Of these, two suspicious cases have been kept under medical supervision,” added Mr. Vij.

Mr. Vij said the State government was in contact with the international airports in Chandigarh and Delhi so that every person coming from China can be properly examined.

State health officials said that samples of both the patients have been sent to the National Institute of Virology for testing.

The Mumbai patient, a businessman from Juhu had travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of nCoV outbreak, for a work trip on January 14 and returned to Mumbai on January 21. According to doctors, he developed symptoms like cough and fever from January 24. He is the fifth patient quarantined at Mumbai’s civic-run Kasturba Hospital. While four patients admitted earlier have tested negative, reports of their repeat samples are awaited.

The Nanded patient has been quarantined at the Shankarrao Chavan Government Medical College and Hospital. Doctors said his condition is stable and he has been placed under isolation because he developed symptoms after returning from China.

As many as 3,997 travellers have been screened at the Mumbai airport of whom 18 travellers were from Maharashtra. While the rest are being followed up on telephone, in all five have been quarantined in Mumbai, two in Pune and one in Nanded. State health officials said they would follow up on all travellers from the State for up to 28 days. Those who develop symptoms like cough, cold and fever should immediately report to the hospital.

261,2020/01/29,‘Govt. dividing country on religious lines’,"More than 30,000 Dalits and Adivasis held a dharna opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at the Anaj Mandi in Khargone in southern Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday, urging the Centre to withdraw the contentious law and asking the State government to pass a resolution against it.

“Should we leave the fate of our citizenship in the hands of a government that is casteist and communal?” asked Madhuri Krishnaswamy of the Jagrit Adivasi Dalit Sangathan, addressing the protest rally. “The Centre is inflicting attack after attack on its citizens. Is this what we choose a government for?”

On the second day of protests against the law, the proposed nationwide implementation of the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register, in Madhya Pradesh’s Nimar region, the Dalit and Advisasi groups made clear that they were in no mood to relent.

“Until the NPR and the NRC is stopped, our movement will continue to grow,” said Ms. Krishnaswamy.

262,2020/01/29,Punjab CM wants Centre to take up locust issue with Pakistan,"Concerned at the spate of attacks on crops by swarms of locusts in neighbouring areas of southern Punjab bordering Rajasthan, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to direct the Union Ministry of External Affairs and the Indian High Commission in Islamabad to immediately take up the issue with the government of Pakistan, from where the pests are originating.

Capt. Amarinder, in a letter to the Prime Minister, said there has been a sustained attack of locusts on crops in Rajasthan recently.

Breeding areas

A significant number of these pests have also entered into the neighbouring areas of southern Punjab.

“Although Rajasthan has been taking the required action to control the attack, the best method of control is to manage the breeding ground itself, which incidentally falls in the adjoining desert area of Pakistan,” he wrote, emphasising the need to take up this issue directly with the government of Pakistan and impressing upon them to take effective steps to sanitise the breeding areas of these locusts.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, which is mandated to control locusts internationally, may also be asked to take effective steps in Pakistan to control breeding, the Chief Minister wrote.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4cjv0z/article30678801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29CAPT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-cm-wants-centre-to-take-up-locust-issue-with-pakistan/article30678802.ece
263,2020/01/29,‘Restrict anganwadi staff from performing extra work’,"The Madhya Pradesh government has issued an order restricting anganwadi workers from being employed for duties not relating to the Integrated Child Development Services.

Centres’ performances

“Disciplinary action has been taken against workers for not performing other duties. This has affected performances of the centres and obstructed improvement of nutrition levels among children,” said a note from the General Administration Department.

“We had approached the GAD for the reiteration of a previous order restraining around 97,000 workers from carrying out extraneous duties,” State Women and Child Development Department Principal Secretary Anupam Rajan told The Hindu.

As an anganwadi worker is the lone worker at the grassroots level in every village, he said, often other departments get them to deliver services and verify documents. “Sometimes the work is more than required, and it may affect their teaching and the provision of childcare.”

Only during exceptional circumstances such as elections, however, they’d be assigned duties. “The process happens once in five years and is time-bound,” he said.

While 60% of the children under five were underweight in the State, according to the National Family Health Survey-3 (2005-2006), it came down to 42.8 % in the next survey (2015-2016).",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/restrict-anganwadi-staff-from-performing-extra-work/article30678779.ece
264,2020/01/29,Maharashtra to seek legal opinion on handing of Elgaar cases to NIA,"Maharashtra has sought legal opinion from Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni over the sudden takeover of the Elgaar Parishad case by the NIA.

Sources said the NIA letter demanding handing over of the cases “as early as possible” was sent, as per protocol, by the Director General of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday.

Confirming this, Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Sanjay Kumar told The Hindu, “We have received a proposal from the DGP. Chief Minister has directed us to seek a legal view.”

The DGP’s proposal has requested a time frame within which the cases can be handed over under the NIA Act. Sources said the NIA letter dated January 25, seeking take over of Pune Police’s investigations into the Elgaar Parishad cases, is based on an internal report submitted on January 24 recommending this on “certain grounds”. However, the “grounds” are not disclosed, they said.

The State is also looking into the basis of the January 24 report. “We have received the NIA letter today and also a proposal from the DGP in this regard. We are mulling over the future course of action after legal opinion is sought,” said Home Minister Anil Deshmukh.

If challenged in court, Maharashtra could become only the second State to take the NIA order to court.

265,2020/01/29,Mixed response in AMU to Sharjeel Imam’s arrest,"A group of students of Aligarh Muslim University took out a protest march in support of Sharjeel Imam who was arrested on Tuesday in Bihar on charges of sedition and spreading communal hatred.

The arrest was made after a video of his speech, made on January 16 in AMU, went viral. The students argued that the statements he made were not seditious in nature and cited former Chief Justice Markandey Katju’s recent article where he disapproved of Mr. Imam’s speech, but also said it was not criminal in nature.

‘Student voices’

Salman Imtiaz, president of the Aligarh Muslim Students’ Union (2018-2019), said charging Mr. Imam, student leader of Jawaharlal Nehru University and the former IITian with draconian laws like sedition and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, shows the insecurity of the government. “These laws are a colonial legacy and have no space in a democratic country. The BJP is fearing student voices and is abusing the laws to brutalise us,” he said.

Mr. Imtiaz said one might not agree with the usage of his words, but he had a right to express his views on civil disobedience aimed at forcing the government to roll back CAA, NRC and NPR.

“While we are critical of the usage of words by Mr. Imam, we stand by his side to save him from the draconian laws,” he added.

Mohammad Sajjad, professor of history at AMU, said Mr. Imam’s speech could be “objectionable, deplorable or debatable”, but it was not in the realm of sedition. “As a student, he should be allowed to experiment with ideas. The response to these adventures and misadventures should have come from the academic space.”

The Delhi police action, he said, was disproportionate if one compared it with the “inefficiency it showed in the case of JNU incident where hundreds of masked persons attacked the students”.

He also said the State and society should reflect upon why a section of society was feeling alienated and discriminated against. In the video where Mr. Imam could be heard asking people to cut off Assam from India, Prof. Sajjad said he felt he could be asking for “civil blockade”.

Citing certain writings of Mr. Imam which are in the public domain, Prof Sajjad said he could be playing into the hands of the Hindutva forces and that his speech could be harmful to the secular nature of the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.

A large section of students disapproved of Mr. Imam. Sumaiyya Khan, a student of law faculty, said, “We should understand his approach is a threat to the secular fabric of the anti-CAA-NRC protest.”

Faizul Hasan, former AMUSU president, who was also charged with spreading religious enmity, also disapproved of the statement. “When I was charged with spreading hate, I addressed the media and clarified my stand,” he said.

Shafey Kidwai, the university spokesperson, said AMU administration would identify the protesters and organisers of the march and take appropriate action against them.

Exams boycotted

Meanwhile, students continued to boycott exams and classes on Tuesday and put locks on the gates of different faculties.

After a general body meeting, the students once again demanded the resignation of the Vice-Chancellor and the Registrar.

“We know we are risking our careers, but none of us have the moral courage to tell the protesting students to call off their demand for resignation. We see the V-C and the Registrar complicit in police action of December 15, and don’t feel safe,” said a student requesting anonymity.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lkbm07/article30678760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29LOCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mixed-response-in-amu-to-sharjeel-imams-arrest/article30678761.ece
266,2020/01/29,BJP MLA speaks out against CAA,"Speaking out against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, BJP MLA Narayan Tripathi, who had cross-voted in favour of a Congress Bill in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly last year, said we should either respect the Constitution and not formulate divisive laws based on religion, or tear it off and throw it away.

‘Polarised villages’

Abandoning the party line, the Maihar legislator highlighted how the law had polarised villages with former friends and neighbours refusing to even look at each other now.

“Where there are internal disputes, peace can’t prevail. We talk about Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (The world is one family) on one hand, and on the other divide the country based on religion. The country can’t be run like this,” he said.

Stating that he hailed from a rural area and understood the villages well, he said, “The poor are still trying to get Aadhaar cards made. Collecting so many papers just to prove citizenship will be impossible.”

Mr. Tripathi claimed there was rising unemployment, poverty and illiteracy in the country. “Doing vote-bank politics and dividing people on religious lines is not appropriate for today. Where there is no brotherhood, there is no progress,” he said.

Welcoming the comments, State Congress spokesman Durgesh Sharma said, “Every Indian who cares for the country and the Constitution will surely speak out against the CAA and the nationwide implementation of the National Register of Citizens. Mr. Tripathi’s opposition is a protest against the divisive ideology of the BJP. And his stand is in the interest of the country.”

On July 24 last year, Mr. Tripathi, along with another party MLA Sharad Kaul, had stunned the BJP by cross-voting in favour of a Bill moved by the ruling Congress in the Vidhan Sabha. Formerly a Congressman, he had switched to the BJP in 2014, and termed the vote a ghar waapsi (homecoming).

The comments spell anxiety for the BJP in the State, already grappling with a spate of resignations from its minority cell over the CAA since December. Last Friday, 67 members quit the party in Indore. Earlier, hundreds of workers quit the party in Khargone, Guna, Burhanpur, Bhopal and Satna districts.

267,2020/01/29,"Elgaar case: will hand over documents after due process, says police","The Pune police on Tuesday refuted reports that they denied the National Investigation Agency (NIA) team access to the Elgaar Parishad case documents, remarking that they would be given to the agency once procedures were completed.

Meanwhile, a political war of words erupted between the ruling and opposition parties over the matter, with senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former State Finance Minister leader Sudhir Mungantiwar warned that the newly-formed Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) could be dismissed by the BJP-led Central government if it deliberately created problems in giving information and documents to the NIA.

A three-member team from the NIA, led by an officer of the superintendent rank, met authorities from the Pune police involved in the Elgaar Parishad-Bhima Koregaon case on Monday.

According to reports, the Pune police had informed the NIA team that the documents pertaining to the case were being presented as evidence in court, and that they would be handed over to the agency post an order from the Maharashtra director general of police.

“There is no conflict whatsoever, as is being projected by some sections of the media… the NIA team has communicated to us that they would be taking over the case. They also held a review meeting on Monday with authorities investigating the Elgaar Parishad case. However, there were certain procedures to be followed and permissions to be taken before handing over the case documents and these could take a week or even a couple of days,” a senior police official connected with the investigation told The Hindu.

Mr. Mungantiwar, on his part, said, “I can understand if there are some technical difficulties in handing over the information in the Elgaar Parishad case to the NIA. But if the State government deliberately creates obstacles and behaves outside the constitutional framework, then the Centre can dismiss this government.”

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders Nawab Malik and Jitendra Awhad, as well as the Congress’ Balasaheb Thorat, criticised Mr. Mungantiwar for his remarks. “The entire Bhima-Koregaon violence [of January 1, 2018] was pre-planned. The then ruling party [the BJP] had orchestrated it in order to poison the social climate. Later investigations into the Elgaar Parishad case by the Pune police were phoney and intellectuals and activists were arrested on trumped-up charges… the issue of the alleged assassination threat to the Prime Minister was bogus,” said Mr. Malik, alleging that the real motive behind the Centre’s handing over the case to the NIA was that it feared that the State government’s Special Investigation Team investigation would expose the Pune police.

Challenging the Centre to dismiss the MVA government, Mr. Malik said dismissing an elected government was tantamount to the murder of democracy. “The public of Maharashtra will not forgive the BJP for that… We [the MVA government] will be conducting our parallel probe into the ‘false’ Elgaar Parishad case. The NIA should tell us what documents they want and we shall give them what they want to investigate,” he said.

While Mr. Thorat said Mr. Mungantiwar’s statement was “born out of frustration”, Mr. Awhad questioned why the Modi government was suddenly transferring the case to the NIA more than two years after the Bhima-Koregaon clashes.

“Earlier, the Centre had lauded the Pune police on what a wonderful job it was doing by probing the Elgaar Parishad-Bhima Koregaon case. Now, when the government has changed and the BJP is no longer in power in the State, the Centre is scared that the Pune Police’s false probe will be exposed,” Mr. Awhad said.

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said he had yet to receive any official communication from the Centre. “I have come to know of this only through the media. I cannot comment on anything until an official letter reaches me, after which we will take legal opinion on how to proceed,” Mr. Deshmukh said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/elgaar-case-will-hand-over-documents-after-due-process-says-police/article30678718.ece

He said 32 people remained admitted in hospitals.

The speeding ST bus (MH06 S 8429), packed with passengers, crashed into the auto-rickshaw (MH15 DY 4233). The impact of the collision was so severe that the bus dragged the autorickshaw along with it and both vehicles fell into a roadside well, the official said.

“At least 21 bodies have been pulled out of the well. The injured are being treated at State-run hospitals,” said Arti Singh, Superintendent of Police, Nashik Rural on Tuesday. “We are pumping out water from the well to check if any more passengers are still stuck in the mud,” she said.

The bus was on its way to Kalwan town in Nashik from the adjoining Dhule district, while the auto-rickshaw was coming from opposite direction, another official said.

Meanwhile, the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), in a release late in the evening, said the bus driver was prima facie responsible for the devastating crash.

Mr. Singh had toyed with the idea at a food processing technology exhibition under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Imphal West district on January 24.

Manipur has 16 districts, five in the central Imphal Valley and the rest in the hills around. Each district is known for growing a specific variety of fruit or herb.

Mr. Singh heads a coalition government where the BJP is the major partner. “The BJP government’s policy of rewriting history in this manner is to essentially belittle the history behind the naming of all the districts of Manipur,” Congress spokesperson Ningombam Bupenda Meitei said.

270,2020/01/29,"Protest wit amazing, says former Bengal Chief Secretary","“I cannot read Urdu but noticed a large poster in the language recently,” said former West Bengal Chief Secretary Ardhendu Sen.

“A little later, I noticed its meaning was written at the bottom of the poster in Hindi. It said ‘do not get scared, it is Jai Shri Ram written in Urdu’,” he said as the entire audience laughed with him. Mr. Sen, a 1976-batch IAS officer, is the first former bureaucrat from Bengal to attend a street protest hosted by a civil society platform, Joint Forum Against NRC, in the city’s central area on Tuesday.

He said the present protest has added “humour and wit to our life”. “The character of the movement has witnessed a sea change. The language has changed; so many posters, placards with so much of humour and fun. I never witnessed this before,” he said. Mr Sen’s brief speech was also filled with satire. “I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi…,” he said at one point.

“He has done what [Mahatma] Gandhiji, Rabindranath [Tagore] and [Jawaharlal] Nehru could not achieve. Time magazine indicated earlier that Mr. Modi is a great divider, but while dividing the country he has brought it together as well. The way Hindus are standing hand-in-hand with Muslims, the way they came together in Shaheen Bagh and Park Circus…the way they unfurl the national flag, all together, singing one song, it is amazing,” said Mr. Sen.

“Mr. Modi made it possible and like Dilip Ghosh [Bengal BJP president], I would like to say, Narendra Modi amar rahe (long live Narendra Modi),” Mr. Sen quipped.

“More than 1.5 crore people are estimated to have taken to streets. I do not know if in Indian history so many ever stepped out of their houses to protest, other than during the Civil Disobedience movement,” said the former bureaucrat, who incidentally is a staunch critic of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. However, on Tuesday he targeted only the “divisive policies” of the Central government.

“Once by killing Gandhi an attempt was made, after Independence, to convert the country to a Hindu Rashtra. A similar attempt has been made now. [But] the people of this country came together to resist the attempt in the past, they are resisting it with equal integrity now,” Mr. Sen said.

Noted economist Amiya Bagchi spoke too. “We all were brought up in a Hindu culture but that was different from this culture of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. Rabindranath always warned against such attempts, such culture to divide people on basis of language or religion. He used to say that people from all cultures and religions have come together in India and we need to remind ourselves of him at this hour,” Professor Bagchi said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/protest-wit-amazing-says-former-bengal-chief-secretary/article30678353.ece

The university maintained that the video was used to defame the Vice-Chancellor and therefore the student was responsible. The student, Bijju Sarkar, who hails from a village in Bankura district, said he had merely forwarded the clip to a friend and it was never his intention to show the Vice-Chancellor in poor light.

Mr. Chakrabarty, in his speech, can be heard saying that even though anti-CAA protesters were reading out the Preamble of the Constitution, the Constitution itself was “brought into effect by minority votes”, with only 293 members of the Constituent Assembly drafting it. This portion of his speech was circulated on WhatsApp.

Handwritten notice

Late on Monday night, the proctor and the warden arrived at the Purba Palli Senior Boys Hostel (PPSBH) and extracted a confession from Mr. Sarkar that he had shot that video and then served him a handwritten eviction notice. The letter addressed to Mr. Sarkar, a second-year history student, was signed by the proctor, Sankar Majumdar.

It said: “As per your confession regarding recording and forward transmission of the video shot on your mobile phone of the Vice-Chancellor’s speech at PPSBH on the occasion of Republic Day flag hoisting which was later used to defame the Vice-Chancellor on social media, I am hereby ordering you to immediately vacate your hostel room.”

When asked by The Hindu whether he had written the notice, Mr. Majumdar declined to reply and asked the reporter to contact the university PRO. The PRO did not answer his phone.

The student, fearing more drastic action, promptly vacated the hostel room and went back to his village. “I come from a very poor family and had bought the mobile phone last month with scholarship money. Many other students too were recording the Vice-Chancellor’s speech, then why was I singled out? I had merely forwarded the clip to a friend. I have no idea why all this happened. I don’t want any more trouble because it’s the question of my future,” Mr. Sarkar, clearly shaken, told The Hindu over phone.

From the eviction notice it is apparent that the student's fault was merely to record and forward a recording of the speech. But it still went on to say: “Kindly note that your video was disruptive and defamatory and maybe termed as circumspect of the Indian IT Act.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/visva-bharati-evicts-student-from-hostel-for-recording-v-cs-speech/article30678241.ece
272,2020/01/29,"Parents’ birth details will not be collected for NPR, says BJD","Odisha’s ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) on Tuesday said that information on the date and place of birth of parents will not be collected for preparation of the National Population Register (NPR). Data for the NPR is likely to be collected in the State between April 16 and May 31.

Talking to presspersons after a party meeting here, ahead of the budget session of Parliament, BJD MP and spokesperson Pinaki Misra said that following objections from the Odisha government, the Centre had clarified that Column 13(2) of the NPR form was optional and the norm would not be applicable in the State.

Mr. Misra further said that the BJD supported the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), but was not in favour of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The BJD’s stand had already been clarified by Chief Minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik, he added.

Enumeration of OBCs

Mr. Misra said that in the upcoming budget session, BJD MPs would raise the demand for enumeration of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in the 2021 Census.

In the 2011 Census, OBC enumeration was not carried out, and even if it was done by any chance, it was never disclosed. As a result of that, OBC communities, which are a very important part of society, were left out, said Mr. Misra.

Census format

It may be recalled that the Odisha Cabinet had on January 11 resolved to move the Centre with the plea to conduct a socio-economic caste enumeration, along with the general Census, either by inserting suitable columns in the Census format, or by prescribing a separate format.

“Unavailability of reliable and authentic data about the exact numbers of socially and educationally backward classes and other backward classes/castes, geographical areas of their spread and density has been a huge challenge in ensuring focused and outcome-specific planning,” the Cabinet had said in a resolution.

The BJD parliamentary party meeting, which was chaired by Mr. Patnaik, also decided that the party’s MPs would raise various issues, such as a hike in coal royalty, clean energy cess, the Centre’s assistance in compensating GST (Goods and Services Tax) losses, inter-State river disputes, and pending railway projects in Parliament.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/z5fcgy/article30678208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29NRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/parents-birth-details-will-not-be-collected-for-npr-says-bjd/article30678209.ece
273,2020/01/29,Never thought about Super Over: Rohit Sharma,"Caught unaware about the Super Over scenario, Rohit Sharma took five minutes to “find” his abdomen guard after the third T20 International against New Zealand had ended in a tie here on Wednesday.

The India vice-captain said the team had almost given up with New Zealand going great guns at one point.

“Everything was packed. All my stuff was inside my bag. I had to get it out.

“It literally took me five minutes to find my abdomen guard because I didn’t know where it was,” Rohit said.

“I mean we never thought it would go to the Super Over, the way they were batting at one point. It looked like they could easily win the game,” he added.

No training possible

Rohit said there is no training possible for Super Over eventualities.

In fact, the Indian team wasn’t aware of the Super Over and came to know only after the match had finished in a tie.

“I don’t know if you can train for a Super Over. We’ve got a T20 specialist in Bumrah. Super Over or whether he bowls in a T20 match is the same for him. There’s no training required there for him.

“But for the batters, you generally see who’s in good nick on that particular day and you assess and try and get that guy to bat. Probably if I hadn’t got the 60 today, it wouldn’t have been me going to face the Super Over. It could have been Shreyas Iyer or someone else.”

‘Bowlers under pressure’

Talking about the moment when he hit those successive Super Over sixes, Rohit said it is always the bowler who is under pressure in such situations.

“From what I’ve seen in Super Overs, whatever you are chasing, it’s the bowler who is under pressure. That’s my understanding. That’s why when I walked out to bat, I was thinking about whether I should move around in the crease or stay still.

“There were two or three thoughts like that but, in the end, I decided that I will stay still. Let him make the mistake.

“That was my thought process. And, he bowled it in my zone, and I smashed it.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/35g962/article29900054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03-QUOTE-ROHIGI36LM89G4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/never-thought-about-super-over-rohit-sharma/article30686755.ece

Off-spinner Raza, who claimed all three wickets to fall in the morning session, took another three after lunch to finish with figures of 7/113 — the second best return for Zimbabwe in Test cricket.

The scores:

Zimbabwe 406 vs Sri Lanka 293 in 119.5 overs (Angelo Mathews 64, Dimuth Karunaratne 44, Oshada Fernando 44, Dhananjaya de Silva 42, Sikandar Raza 7/113).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/zimbabwes-raza-scalps-seven-in-test-against-sl/article30686585.ece

Clarke (4/25) shone with the ball as the Kiwis restricted West India to 238 and then made an unbeaten 46 off 42 balls to take New Zealand home in the company of Joey Field, who was not out on 38.

Chasing the modest target, New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals to find themselves in a spot of bother at 153 for eight in 34.5 overs before Clarke and Field took them home.

The scores: West Indies 238 in 47.5 overs (Kirk McKenzie 99, Kristian Clarke 4/25) lost to New Zealand 239/8 in 49.4 overs (Joey Field 38 n.o., Kristian Clarke 46 n.o.).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-under-19-world-cup-clarke-field-put-kiwis-in-last-four/article30686428.ece
276,2020/01/29,Ranji | Manender guides Rajasthan to victory,"Rajasthan, thanks to opener Manender Singh’s impressive century and handy contribution from southpaw Mahipal Lomror, scored a nine-wicket win over Hyderabad on the third day of the four-day Ranji Trophy Elite Group match at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Wednesday.

Earlier, resuming at 101 for six, Hyderabad was bowled out for 156. Even this modest score was possible due to the belligerence of seasoned opener P. Akshath Reddy, who cracked his first half-century (71, 162b, 8x4, 2x6) of the season.

Short-pitch stuff

Cleverly, the Rajasthan left-arm pace duo of Aniket Choudhary and Tanveer-ul-Haq preferred the short-pitched bowling to repeatedly unsettle the batsmen and they were successful too.

Chama Milind was the first to go when he ducked to Aniket, expecting a bouncer only to spoon up a simple catch, as the length ball never really rose.

Then, Mehdi Hasan played an irresponsible shot. After slashing Tanveer uppishly to the third man fence, Akshath walked down and had a word of caution with him. But Mehdi repeated the stroke off the next delivery only to edge to the wicketkeeper.

Just when Akshath was threatening to score a few important runs at the end, he went for an ambitious lofted stroke off part-time slow bowler Lomror and was bowled.

Defending 192, the Hyderabad bowling attack struggled, compared to the spirited show it put up on the second day.

With star bowler Ravi Kiran failing to provide the breakthroughs on a pitch which had also eased considerably, the rest struggled.

After Yash Kothari was dismissed cheaply, Manender Singh (107 n.o., 147b, 14x4) and Lomror (71 n.o., 114b, 8x4, 1x6) came up with an unbeaten 176-runs partnership.

Manender was lucky to be dropped thrice — on 49, 76 and 98 — slip fielder Jaweed Ali being the culprit on all three occasions off spinners Saaketh, Mehdi Hasan and pacer Ravi Teja respectively.

However, the two stayed put and and ensured that there was no way the home team could come back into the match.

Rajasthan now has 16 points from six matches and Hyderabad remains at the bottom of the table with six points from seven games, winning just one and losing six. It next plays Vidarbha in its last game on February 12 here with the threat of relegation looming large.

277,2020/01/29,Wet patches play spoilsport,"For the second time in as many weeks, a whole day’s play was lost due to wet outfield at the HPCA Stadium despite the snowy mountains overlooking the stadium basking in sunshine for virtually the whole day. With the penultimate day’s play of Himachal Pradesh’s Ranji Trophy Group B clash versus Mumbai abandoned, the visiting side’s chance of forcing a result was over.

After the second day’s play was washed out due to rain, clear skies in the morning — despite heavy overnight downpour — raised hopes of resumption of play. Umpires S. Ravi and Vineet Kulkarni conducted four inspections along with match referee Gaurav Vashisht but such were the wet patches on either side square off the pitch that the officials were forced to call stumps at 2.40 p.m.

Despite BCCI president Sourav Ganguly insisting on state associations possessing covers to protect the full ground, barely half of the HPCA ground was covered.

Similar incident

A similar incident had forced a full day’s play to be abandoned in HP’s tie versus Baroda last week.

“Had the entire ground been under covers, the game would have been possible today. As long as it’s not raining, we could have played. The problem is the areas which are not covered,” said Aditya Tare, Mumbai captain. “There are venues in India where the entire ground gets covered. Obviously not every ground has covers for the entire outfield but it’s unfortunate because there had been prediction for rain.”

Torn

While no HPCA official was available for comment, it is understood that the HPCA had to despatch half of its covers to Una, where the BCCI’s U-23 women’s one-dayers are in progress. However, lack of proper covers — torn according to a few women cricketers — has resulted in the women’s game being abandoned.

HPCA hopes it will be equipped with a new set of covers before next month’s ODI against South Africa.

278,2020/01/29,"Andhra wins by seven wickets, retains top spot","Kerala on Wednesday slid to another Ranji Trophy defeat well inside three days.

The latest humiliating loss came against Andhra; it was the fifth from seven matches. With just nine points, Kerala is placed third from the bottom.

Since two teams, out of the 18 combined from Groups A and B, will be relegated to Group C, Jalaj Saxena’s men ought to be an anxious bunch. If they keep the current form, in the last match against Vidarbha, they could be engrossed in a fascinating battle with Hyderabad and Madhya Pradesh for the bottom two places during the final round of the preliminary league next week.

Hyderabad, though, is in no mood to give up its last place in the table at the moment: it registered its sixth loss in seven matches, against Rajasthan at home. It remains on six points — no prize for guessing how it got all those points (because of its win over Kerala, of course).

Meanwhile, Andhra, continues to be perched on top of the table. The latest victory has taken its tally to 27 points from six games.

With two more matches in hand, Ricky Bhui’s men may have done just about enough to ensure a place in the quarterfinals (top five go through). They must have expected to take their six points some time on Wednesday afternoon, given the brittle batting of Kerala. Only an extraordinary innings or two from visiting batsmen could have taken the match to the final day.

That didn’t happen. Kerala’s second innings, which commenced at the start of the day, folded up in just 45 overs, for 135. Robin Uthappa and Rahul Prem got into 20’s — something of an achievement when you recall that no top-order batsman had done it in the first innings — but none was willing to spend some time at the wicket.

Once again, Andhra’s seamers shared the spoils. Debutant S.M.D. Rafi and left-armer Y. Prithviraj claimed three wickets each, while K.V. Sasikanth took two.

The host needed 43 to win and it reached home with seven wickets to spare.

279,2020/01/29,India vs. NZ | Rohit’s sensational sixes trump Williamson’s classy effort,"Rohit Sharma belted two sixes off the final two deliveries of a Super Over to give India victory in the third T20I against New Zealand at Seddon Park here on Wednesday. The visitors thus clinched the series 3-0 with two games to spare.

Rohit finished on 15 not out after he hit two sixes off Tim Southee to lead India to 20-0 after the Kiwis had scored 17-0 off Jasprit Bumrah (Kane Williamson 11, Martin Guptill 5).

Dramatic final over

New Zealand captain Williamson had almost single-handedly led his side to a win in the regulation 20 overs when he blasted 95 from 48 balls but was dismissed by Mohammed Shami with three balls remaining in the final over and two runs needed for victory.

Shami, however, conceded just one run through a bye off the penultimate ball, then bowled Ross Taylor to leave New Zealand on 179 for six.

India, which scored 179 for five in its innings, won the first two games of the five-match series in Auckland.

Rohit (65) and K.L. Rahul had given India a blistering start, with Rohit reaching his 20th T20I half-century inside the first six overs as they put on 77 runs in the first seven.

Rahul was dismissed off the final ball of the ninth over, but with the score at 89 for one and with 11 overs remaining, India was still well placed to score over 200 before New Zealand clamped down in the second half of the innings.

Hamish Bennett, who got clubbed for three sixes and two fours by Rohit in the sixth over, dismissed the Indian opener in the 11th and, two balls later, got rid of Shivam Dube.

The fourth game will be played in Wellington on Friday.

280,2020/01/29,Mike Gatting bats for five-day Tests,"It was an afternoon to remember for the budding cricketers at the Tendulkar Middlesex Global Academy on Tuesday as they had an opportunity to interact with the two legends of the game — Sachin Tendulkar and Mike Gatting.

As they launched the new facilities at the Tendulkar Middlesex Global Academy DY Patil Sports Centre, both the former cricketers made it a point to guide the young guns with their valuable inputs.

No short-cuts

While Tendulkar felt that the youngsters should not take short-cuts, Gatting batted for traditional five-day Tests. “They should listen to the players. They will give you an honest opinion. We will talk about it, but if we’re going to change it for making the game better, then it’s fine, but I'm not sure,” Gatting told The Hindu.

There are proposals to make Test cricket a four-day affair and Gatting — a former England captain and the World Cricket Committee chairman at the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) — doesn’t really subscribe to the idea.

“We have seen over this Test series against South Africa where matches have gone on till the fifth day. You do need five days. If it rains and you lose a day, but if you didn’t have a fifth day, the match would be a draw. So there are lots of things that’s there,” Gatting said.

Unique form

He also lauded India captain Virat Kohli for promoting the longer format of the game.

“Virat is a wonderful player, but he is also a very nice man. And he appreciates that Test cricket is a unique form of the game, and it always will be. It is a longer form but it is something that is worth keeping because you do learn so much about yourself as a cricketer, and as a person, when you are playing over five days,” Gatting said.

In the past, Tendulkar too had batted for five-day Test and, while addressing the youngsters, he said: “There were number of occasions where I was not able to perform to my expectations but sports taught me to get back on my feet again and not find short-cuts.”

“There will be tough challenges along the way; don’t cheat, else you will get exposed in front of the whole world,” Tendulkar said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mi6owe/article30677238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29TENDULKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mike-gatting-bats-for-five-day-tests/article30677239.ece
281,2020/01/29,"For champion teams, every ground is ‘home’","In cricket, an away win is seen as special because it involves overcoming unfamiliar conditions, often hostile crowds, and neutralising the special knowledge of the environment where the opponents have played most of their lives. Things might be changing for India, though.

Two India captains have both said, in effect, that a win is a win is a win. It does not matter where you win, the important thing is to do so, said Virat Kohli as his team began the run to the No. 1 position. Anil Kumble said something similar. But as the World Test championship got underway, Kohli suggested that teams winning abroad should earn more points.

For a champion there is no home ground, said the seven-time All-England badminton champion Erland Kops. Likewise with champion teams. One of the criticisms levelled against the Indian team when they first climbed to the No. 1 spot in the rankings under Mahendra Singh Dhoni was that they had got there without series wins in Australia, South Africa or Sri Lanka.

Any time, anywhere

The argument was that India had chosen their opponents and home venues judiciously to earn the points. It may have been unfair, but the two best teams of the last four decades or so — the West Indies and Australia — had shown they could win any time anywhere. This was an important element in their anointment as the best team of their time.

Just how much of a difference does playing at home make? Statistical research into soccer, ice hockey, basketball and other sports at the club and international levels concluded that “home advantage” gives a team a more than even chance of winning.

That puts England’s 3-1 series win over South Africa this week in perspective. Apart from bringing to the fore the question of home and away matches and what they mean over a period of time, it also throws light on the decline of the game in the land of Graeme Smith, Allan Donald, Jonty Rhodes and Dale Steyn, to name only a few stalwarts after their readmission into international cricket.

When a strong team falters thus, we console ourselves by saying that such things are cyclical, and everything will get back to ‘normal’ soon enough. Anyway, that’s for another time, as we look at India’s strong away showing in recent years.

India take on New Zealand in a two-Test series next month on their current tour (the spread of matches: 5 T20I, 3 ODI and 2 Tests probably tells us which way the game is headed), and the question is: will they extend their successful run? In the last six years, India have won and lost an equal number of Tests abroad, 14.

Every other team has lost more than they have won abroad, which fits in with theory but is at odds against current practices.

For one, modern travel is not quite as daunting as when the theories were first formulated. There is something to be said about sleeping at home in your own bed, of course. But players have made the adjustments to virtually walk into a game after landing in a faraway country across many time zones. Despite complaining of lack of sleep, India beat New Zealand in the first two T20 Internationals, for example.

Tours are more frequent, which means that players are more familiar with conditions now than they were in the past. Eden Park, where the first two matches were played in New Zealand, is a ground that takes some getting used to.

Used essentially for rugby, it requires visitors, both batsmen and bowlers, to work out the geometry of the angles and straight lines — something that comes naturally to the local players. Champion teams adapt quickly, as India did, figuring out which was the shortest boundary and where to place the swiftest fielders.

Familiarity breeds confidence; but sometimes, as India showed, the reverse could also be true.

Crowd support

The third strike against visiting teams, the local crowds, hold no terrors for India. And they haven’t ever since the diaspora grew in numbers. Dhoni had said sometime ago that wherever India played, it felt like home because of the substantial support they received at the grounds. Often Indian supporters outnumber local fans. This, of course, is a situation unique to India. Indian food is always available; Indian music, Indian films and Indian parties too.

Not so long ago, India habitually lost the first Test of a series and then struggled to play catch-up.

283,2020/01/29,Death of eucalyptus trees raise environmental concerns in the Nilgiris,"The death of eucalyptus trees, en masse, is being reported around Udhagamandalam town and parts of the Nilgiris, threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of people who rely on them, and also causing concern among conservationists.

The eucalyptus, which is an invasive species of flora, was planted in large numbers by the British in the areas surrounding Udhagamandalam town and across the Nilgiris. The leaves of the tree are gathered and used to produce eucalyptus oil by hundreds of daily wage workers every day, mostly women, who hand them in to eucalyptus oil distilleries. The workers have been noticing the mass death of the trees over the last year, which they say is characterised by the trees dying from the “top-down,” with the top branches first being affected, and the tree slowly withering away.

Conservationists believe that the death of the trees are a typical sign of “forest dieback,” defined as accelerated tree mortality in any given area, characterised by the woody extremities of the trees first being affected and gradually spreading to the tree and resulting in its ultimate death.

P. Sangavathy, a 70-year-old resident of Khandal who has been collecting eucalyptus leaves to supply to eucalyptus oil manufactures since she was 10-years-old, said that she had never seen death of eucalyptus trees on such a scale. “The trees are dying and we are very afraid of whether there will be any leaves left to harvest in a few years,” she said.

R. Ayyammal, another eucalyptus leaf harvester, said that previously, she could collect around 20 kg of eucalyptus leaves each day, but now that quantity has dwindled to around half in the areas surrounding the Sandynallah Reservoir. “Though we are managing to collect more leaves which fall off the main tree, the weight of each leaf is significantly less than before, and the leaves look like they have been afflicted with some kind of disease,” she said.

The mass death of thousands of trees is being seen in Buttfire, Thalakundah, Sandynallah and Kuruthukulli, all in the immediate vicinity of Udhagamandalam town, said M. Rasheed, who runs a eucalyptus distillery in Udhagamandalam. Mr. Rasheed said that till last year, he could distill around 10-12 litres of eucalyptus oil, but now can only manufacture around four litres a day. “The quantity of leaves has also come down drastically, from 600 kg a day last year to just 200-300 kg this year,” he added.

However, conservationists believe that the death of the eucalyptus trees are just one part of a much wider issue of forest dieback affecting many species of flora, including native, indigenous trees across the Nilgiris. Godwin Vasanth Bosco, a restoration ecologist working in the Nilgiris, said that wattle trees, another invasive flora species, have been dying in large numbers in the Western edge, near Kolaribetta and Pandiar, while Shola forests are also exhibiting troubling signs of forest dieback across the Nilgiris.

“I believe these deaths are the first manifestations of climate change and excess carbon emissions, which has weakened the trees and have made them more susceptible to disease or becoming negatively affected by extreme weather,” said Mr. Bosco.

Forest department officials said that they had noticed the tree deaths, but said that the deaths were only occurring in a few sporadic areas. They said that more research needed to be undertaken to understand the causes.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/re1qoj/article30687062.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB30EUCALYPUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/death-of-eucalyptus-trees-raise-environmental-concerns-in-the-nilgiris/article30687063.ece

The record attempt was for the most number of unique dotted kolams in a single place and was adjudged by Asia Book of Records. Tata Tea Chakra Gold along with The Hindu Group and Avinashilingam Institute for Home Science and Higher Education for Women were the claimants for this record.

“Kolam is a process-oriented art,” said Madhukar Subramanian, Brand Manager, Tata Tea Chakra Gold. The event was organised to celebrate Tamil culture and to take the celebration to a new level, he said. Being one of the cultural hotspots of Tamil Nadu, Coimbatore was chosen as the venue of the event, Mr. Subramanian said.

S.

289,2020/01/29,Good response to International Education Fair 2020,"The 17th edition of The Hindu Education Plus International Education Fair 2020 began here on Wednesday at Taj Vivanta.

With New India Assurance as the overseas insurance sponsor and Kumaraguru Institutions as the strategic partner, the fair provided an opportunity to students looking for overseas education to explore various options – choice of country, choice of institution, availability of scholarship and work permit among others.

Inaugurating the fair, V. Lakshminarayanasamy, Managing Director and Chairman, Suguna Group, said it was gratifying to note that Coimbatore had always been a destination for The Hindu to conduct the overseas education fair, what with the city having a number of education institutions and being an education hub.

The students, who looked at higher education abroad, were keen on two aspects – availability of scholarships and work permits. The students thought that a year or two work experience would put them in good stead. Therefore, the institutions participating in the fair should take the message to their governments to relax work permit norms.

Mr. Lakshminarayanasamy also said that students were also looking at institutions in the country that had partnered with institutions abroad for twinning programmes so that they could complete a part of their course here and continue the rest abroad to have a foreign degree.

The first day of the Wednesday’s fair saw a good number of students seek details of undergraduate courses in science, engineering, fashion designing in various countries.

Jonathan Shankar, Immigration Manager, Leads Edu Services, said in Coimbatore she saw as a good response as in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. The students, at the undergraduate level, were looking at science and technology programmes in the U.K. and Canada as the countries post-study work permits.

A few students sought details of post-graduate programmes as well.

Sabari Kishore of Campus France said a lot of visiting students were looking at colleges in France as they seemed to be aware of the fact that they could have the medium of instruction in English and for a fee that was not as high as other countries. A few of the inquiries he got were also for courses related to fashion technology and information technology.

Nithin A., a visitor looking for postgraduate courses in information technology, said he got a fair idea of overseas education at the fair and there were a few institutions that he was interested in. His concern was about the cost of education and that was more or less addressed.

291,2020/01/29,CM inaugurates Gandhipuram flyover,"A two-level flyover at Gandhipuram, constructed at a total cost of ₹194.57 crore, was thrown open to the public on Wednesday.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami inaugurated the second level of the flyover through video conference on January 29.

The first level of the flyover on Nanjappa Road is 1.75 km long and 16.6 metres wide (four-lane) and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami inaugurated it in November 2017. The total cost of the first level flyover is ₹120 crore. The second level is also 1.75 km long and 8.5 metres wide (two lane) and is constructed at a cost of ₹75 crore. Vehicles that use the Nanjappa Road flyover can skip two signals - at Gandhipuram junction and GP junction. Similarly vehicles using the second level can avoid the GP signal junction and Avarampalayam junction.

294,2020/01/29,Price fluctuations lead to uncertainty for onion farmers,"Mahalingam, an onion farmer in Thondamuthur, had five acre under small onion a couple of months ago. While he used to reap nearly 25 tonnes a season, he harvested just 14 tonnes last season.

That was because of unseasonal rain, he says. However, he was able to sell for ₹70 to ₹100 a kg. He will plant small onion again in a couple of months, but is unsure of the prices.

“Many farmers suffered losses last season as yield was affected. The previous season I had stored onion spending a lot on creating the infrastructure for storage. But the prices never went beyond ₹20 a kg,” he says.

In the Palladam - Udumalpet belt, farmers have gone in for small onion on nearly 7,000 acre. “It is difficult to forecast the price for onion. We need to get ₹30 to ₹ 40 a kg to earn profit,” says M. Palanisamy, a farmer in Palladam. He had harvested onions just before Deepavali and the prices were low though the prices shot up in two weeks after that.

At Thalavadi in Erode district, some of the farmers are harvesting small onion now. “The prices are ₹50 a kg and even if we get ₹40 a kg, it will be profitable. But, the winter is severe and the plants are not surviving,” says Manikandan, an onion farmer.

The wholesale price of small onion in Coimbatore market on Tuesday was ₹50 a kg for good quality and in the case of big onion, it was ₹35 a kg. With about 60 wholesale traders, Coimbatore receives nearly 500 tonnes of big onion and 200 tonnes of small onion a day. The current arrivals are from Maharashtra in the case of big onion and from Rasipuram and Sathyamangalam area in the case of small onion.

“From ₹120 to ₹150 a kg last month, prices have fallen to ₹50 a kg or lesser now. The prices are expected to fall further as the season has picked up in Maharashtra for big onion. Small onion arrivals from Karnataka will start in 15 days and the prices may drop further,” says M. Rajendran, president of the Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association.

The city has stopped receiving imported onion as there are no takers.

With Indian arrivals picking up in the coming weeks and prices expected to fall further, the government should encourage exports now so that farmers do not suffer losses. Last year, till April, the wholesale price of big onion was ₹12 a kg. Price fluctuation for onion is steep, he says.

The farmers point out that most of the onion farmers in Tamil Nadu have small land holdings unlike as in Maharashtra or Karnataka. The labour wages have shot up and fluctuation of prices is frequent and steep. The government should fix a minimum price for vegetables, says Mr. Palanisamy.

There is no technology intervention that will help mechanise harvest or financial support to set up storage facilities. Hence, costs keep moving up every year. “There are many farmers who suffered losses last season,” says Mr. Mahalingam.

This year, water availability is relatively better and more area is expected to come under onion in this region. Hence, there will not be shortage in availability. But prices might drop, fear the farmers.

The District’s Lead Bank Manager S. Venkataramanan says there are several schemes in all the banks that support farmers in allied activities. For instance, NABARD has a subsidy scheme for agri marketing infrastructure.

Under the programme, subsidy is available for small-scale farmers too. But, the infrastructure should be used for the intended purpose and should be built according to specifications. He urged the farmers to make use of these schemes.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ef8xbb/article30680301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB29SMALLONION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/price-fluctuations-lead-to-uncertainty-for-onion-farmers/article30678437.ece

296,2020/01/29,Corporation to upgrade five urban health centres,"Five Coimbatore Corporation urban primary health centres (UPHCs) will soon see an upgrade at ₹ 7.50 crore

The centres are the SLM Home on Krishnasamy Road, on Bharathi Park Road and in Selvapuram, Peelamedu and Singanallur. The civic body will invest around ₹ 1.50 crore on each of the five centres with the funds that the Central Government is giving under the National Urban Health Mission., says sources familiar with the development.

The upgrade comes after the Corporation established three new UPHCs under the very government scheme at ₹ 42 lakh each.

The five UPHCs, after the upgrade, will act as the zonal referral hospitals in each of the five zones of the Corporation.

The objective behind the upgrade is to bring on a par the urban health service with the rural health service, the sources say.

In villages, the health set up is in such a way that there are health sub centres, primary health centres, block primary health centres, taluk hospitals, government hospitals and then the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH), the sources point out.

The sub centres and primary health centres provide primary healthcare, the block health centres and taluk hospitals provide the secondary care and the CMCH the tertiary care. In the urban set up, though, after the urban health centres that provide primary healthcare, the only other government hospital is the CMCH that provides tertiary care, leaving no establishment that provides secondary healthcare.

It is to bridge the gap that the Corporation is upgrading the five UPHCs with the government funds, the sources explain. One of the impacts of providing tertiary care at the zonal level will be that the burden on patients going to the CMCH will come down as they can get medical services at the zonal health centres, which will be open round the clock, have operation theatres to perform caesarian delivery and minor procedures, blood bank, scan and a few other facilities.

And, to offer such service, the Corporation will deploy more doctors, staff nurses and other allied staff, the sources add.

Senior officials say the Corporation will soon float tender to start the construction at the five UPHCs.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/itoxtu/article30680319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB29HOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporation-to-upgrade-five-urban-health-centres/article30678380.ece
297,2020/01/29,"India has the right to enact CAA, not for EU Parliament to comment on it: Israeli Consul General","​India had the right to do what it did by enacting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and it was not for the European Parliament to comment on it, Consul General of Israel for South India Dana Kursh said here on Tuesday.​

“India as a sovereign nation has the right in enacting the CAA. It is not for the European Parliament to decide what India should or not do. India’s sovereignty is to be respected and she knows how to protect her people,” she told journalists at a press meet held ahead of the inauguration of an Indo-Israel International Joint Conference on Sustainable Cities at the Kumaraguru College of Technology.​

The Israeli Consul General was responding to a question on the European Parliament’s move to discuss a resolution critical of the CAA.​

Ms. Kursh said her country and India had faced similar situations in international fora and were wrongly accused of decisions or actions that they took as sovereign nations, be it the United Nations or International Court of Justice.​But her country was solidly behind India and the Israeli support was bipartisan as the case in India as well.​

The trade relationship between India and Israel was growing but she did not have the numbers. And, between Israel and South India the trade was around $ 400 mn in 2018. To further the trade, the two countries were discussing having a free trade agreement.​

“So far the two sides have had 13 rounds of discussion. In India signing the agreement is a complicated thing just as it is so in her country as both are vibrant democracies. I expect a forward movement in this regard once a new government is in place in Tel Aviv.”​

But even without a formal agreement, companies in Israel were keen on identifying the right partner in India and vice versa. Big manufacturing and software names in India were keen on identifying the right start-ups and buying those, Ms. Kursh said and pointed to two instances to underscore her point.​

Israel was looking at expanding business interest with India in agriculture, water, artificial intelligence, cyber security and a few other areas. The Central Government’s defence corridor that included Coimbatore could be one area that Israel was looking at but was waiting for the Central Government to give the project a shape.​

301,2020/01/29,Bargur cattle milk fetches good income for farmers,"Tribal farmers in Bargur hills, who were without permanent income in all these years, have started to feel the change after they began marketing the milk from the indigenous breeds of Bargur cattle that is known for its high nutritive and medicinal properties.

The cattle, known for its endurance, speed and trotting ability, is a native to Bargur forest areas in Anthiyur Taluk and the average milk production of the cow is less than three litres a day. The population of the breed that was over one lakh declined to less than 5,000 a few years ago and hence Bargur Cattle Research Station was established to conserve the breed. In the absence of marketing opportunities, farmers used to sell the milk for less than ₹ 20 a litre to tea shops in their area and sell their cattle during the annual Sri Gurunathaswamy Temple festival at Anthiyur.

Hence, to conserve the breed and also provide regular income to the farmers, Surabi Milk and Agri Products Producers’ Group was formed in November, 2019 that have 311 farmers as its members currently.

C. Karthikeyan, Field Officer, said that two vehicles procure milk from farmers within 25 km radius from Oosimalai, Eratti, Bejalatti, Devarmalai and other hamlets and transport it to the cooling centre at Thamaraikarai that has a capacity of 500 litres. Later, the milk is transported to Anthiyur and Erode and sold, cow’s milk at ₹ 100 per litre, and buffalo’s milk at ₹ 90 per litre, he added.

Appaiyaa of Thamaraikarai, a dairy farmer, said that earlier he used to sell a litre of milk for ₹ 15 to 20 to a tea stall fetching him less than ₹ 600 a month. “Earlier, income is not permanent. But now I get ₹ 45 for a litre of milk”, he added. Channappan of the same area said that he is getting an average of ₹ 1,500 to ₹ 1,700 a month by selling the milk. Since 80% of the land is rain-fed, farmers cultivate ragi, maize, French beans and small millets that is stored by them for longer use. Since there is little income from the cattle, we sell it during the temple festival and purchase things and arrange marriage for children, he said.

P. Alagesan, Senior Scientist and Head, ICAR - Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK), MYRADA at Gobichettipalayam told The Hindu that income of the farmers has started to improve which is also permanent. He said that proposal is to widen the procurement area, increase the storage capacity to 1,000 litre and open sales outlets at Chinthamani Cooperative Supermarket and at the District Police office canteen. “Besides ensuring stable income for farmers, it also helps in conserving the breed”, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bargur-cattle-milk-fetches-good-income-for-farmers/article30678186.ece

Mr. Imam was produced at the residence of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Purushottam Pathak in the evening amidst high security, said advocate Mishika Singh, appearing for the JNU research scholar in the matter.

Mr. Imam was arrested from Bihar’s Jehanabad on January 28 for allegedly making inflammatory speeches at the Jamia Millia Islamia University here and in Aligarh.

He was brought to Delhi on January 29.

The situation in the Patiala House Courts Complex was tense after the Delhi Police informed that Mr. Imam would be produced before the Magistrate there.

Some lawyers raised slogans against Mr. Imam, held up posters calling him a “traitor” and demanded that he be hanged.

One of the lawyers said, “We are here to protest against those who talk about breaking the country. All lawyers are united against such traitors. He does not deserve to be outside jail. Strict action should be taken against him.”

303,2020/01/29,"Delhi Services control: it’s like hiring an artisan and chopping off his limbs, says counsel in SC","Depriving the Delhi government control over the Services is like hiring an artisan and chopping off his limbs, Delhi government counsel and senior advocate K.V. Vishwanathan told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

“Electing a government and then depriving it control over the Services would only cripple governance,” Mr. Vishwanathan submitted in court..

A five-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra on Wednesday took up for hearing a reference made in February last by a Division Bench of Justices A.K. Sikri and Ashok Bhushan on whether the Delhi government has control over services. However, as the Union government was not represented in the hearing, the Bench adjourned the case for hearing after two weeks.

Mr. Vishwanathan later told The Hindu, “The Services is integral to the government. Officers are not just delegates of the government, they are, in fact, linked to the elected government"".

The Sikri-Bhushan Bench gave a split opinion on the question of services on February 14, 2019. While Justice Bhushan held that the Delhi government has no power over services, Justice (now retired) Sikri, who was the lead judge on the Bench, took the middle path.

Justice Bhushan, in his separate opinion, said Entry 41 of the State List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, dealing with ‘State Public Services’, was outside the purview of the Delhi Legislative Assembly.

Justice Sikri, on the other hand, concluded that files on the transfers and postings of officers in the rank of secretary, head of department and joint secretary could be directly submitted to the Lieutenant Governor (LG). As far as DANICS (Delhi Andamans Nicobar Islands Civil Service) cadre was concerned, the files could be processed through the Council of Ministers led by the Chief Minister to the LG, Justice Sikri wrote. Again, in case of a difference of opinion, the LG prevails.

Justice Sikri said there was need to evolve a “just and fair mechanism”. Calling the Delhi government's arguments that assumption of full and exclusive powers over the transfers and postings as “doubtful”, Justice Sikri said the situation in Delhi was “peculiar”.

The judge had proposed the setting up Civil Service Boards to take care of service matters in case of grade one, two, three and four officers. The board regarding grade four and three officers could be led by the Services Secretary and the other by the Chief Secretary.

The February 2019 judgment on individual appeals followed a Constitution Bench verdict on July 4, 2018. That Bench held that the LG was bound by the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers of the National Capital Territory (NCT) government.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/m3ue2j/article30689778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL30-DOME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-services-control-its-like-hiring-an-artisan-and-chopping-off-his-limbs-says-counsel-in-sc/article30683971.ece

At a press conference, Mr. Javadekar, who is also a Union Minister, accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government of hindering the Capital’s development.

The Centre has conferred ownership rights to over 40 lakh people living in 1,731 unauthorised colonies of Delhi and has also framed a scheme for their development, he said

“Under the Jahan Jhuggi Wahi Makan scheme, two- room houses are being allotted. The Centre also waived conversion charge of ₹10 lakh for shopkeepers and did away with the threat of their establishments getting sealed,” he said.

Mr. Javadekar said the Narendra Modi government had “expanded the Delhi Metro network by 116 kilometers” and “60 lakh persons use the metro daily”.

“But the Kejriwal government delayed Metro Phase-IV project by three years resulting in increase in cost of construction,” he added.

The Minister also accused Mr. Kejriwal of supporting the tukde-tukde gang.

The teacher’s body also attacked the Delhi Police, saying it immediately went after Mr. Imam while no arrest has been made in connection with the January 5 violence on JNU campus.

“While there may be considerable scope for disagreement with the remarks allegedly made by the student, it has been persuasively argued by legal experts that these remarks do not warrant a charge of sedition and there are other reasons behind the sedition law being invoked,” JNUTA said in a statement.

It said the “continuation of the colonial era law on sedition on the statute books of independent India has also been subjected to widespread questioning, particularly due to its rampant misuse by governments to curb dissent”.

JNU has also had a direct experience of this not so long ago, it said.

317,2020/01/29,Two held guilty of killing their colleague,"A Delhi court has convicted two labourers for killing their colleague during a fight in west Delhi in 2014.

According to the prosecution, the accused had murdered the deceased at the shop of their employer following a quarrel over some petty issue.

Additional Sessions Judge Pooran Chand held both accused guilty on the evidence of the fourth colleague of the accused, the forensic report and the disclosure statements of the accused persons, which led to the recovery of the weapon of offence.

“The forensic report shows that bloodstains taken from the person of both the accused matched with the DNA profile of the deceased. A wooden log was recovered at the instance of one of the accused. Even the bloodstains lifted from the weapon of offence matched with the DNA profile of the deceased which clearly points towards the guilt of accused persons,” the court said.

“In view of the corroborative evidence of the prosecution witnesses as well as the scientific evidence in the form of post-mortem report and forensic report as well as recovery of weapon of offence on the disclosure statements of accused, this court is of the considered opinion that prosecution has been able to prove the circumstantial evidences unerringly pointing out towards the guilt of the accused and ruling out any hypothesis of innocence of the accused,” Mr. Chand said.

“The prosecution has been able to bring the entire chain of evidences which, in totality, leads to a definite conclusion that in all human probability, it is the accused who in furtherance of their common intention committed the murder. Resultantly, both the accused are held guilty of offence punishable under Section 302/34 of the IPC,” the judge said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/two-held-guilty-of-killing-their-colleague/article30678877.ece
318,2020/01/29,AAP attacks BJP for ‘sting op’ in govt. schools,"The BJP on Tuesday touched a raw nerve with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by getting its eight MPs, including a Rajya Sabha member, to conduct a “sting operation” on the state of Delhi government schools. They visited schools and shot videos to “expose” the condition of the schools.

Reacting to a compilation of the videos tweeted by Home Minister Amit Shah, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that the videos made false claims.

He played videos shot at the eight schools to show the “reality” of the situation, at a press conference here.

“Out of 1,024 government schools in Delhi, the BJP could only find eight schools with some deficiencies and even those turned out to be false. Gautam Gambhir tweeted a video of a closed school. There is a notice on the gate that says that the school had been shifted to another building from October 2019. I have the demolition orders for the school,” Mr. Sisodia said. Another school in Prem Nagar also had demolition orders issued for it, he added.

He said that Sahib Singh Verma tweeted a video of a school in Matiala where the old building is on one side and on the other side are the new buildings. Presenting a video of the new school building, Mr. Sisodia said that Mr. Verma had carefully not let the new building come into frame.

He added that Hansraj Hans had threatened the estate manager at night and opened a school to make a video of a multipurpose room to establish that the school did not have desks.

Inviting Mr. Shah to visit government schools with him once again and witness the transformation, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “Amit Shah may hate us and AAP. But that does not mean he should insult the 16 lakh children, 32 lakh parents and 65,000 teachers of Delhi by lying.”

‘Relevant issues’

Mr. Kejriwal said that he was happy that Mr. Shah and his MPs visited schools to find deficiencies as relevant issues are being discussed.

“We are very happy that relevant issues are being discussed now. This is good politics. Work should be discussed,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He congratulated students, parents and teachers of all of the 1,024 schools in Delhi, saying that the BJP found problems only in eight schools and that they had passed a major test.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/onajzi/article30678831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DEKEJRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-attacks-bjp-for-sting-op-in-govt-schools/article30678832.ece
319,2020/01/29,BJP bringing outsiders to campaign: Kejriwal,"Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was bringing “outsiders” to campaign in the city to defeat the people of Delhi who have worked towards development. He said that this time, the election will be fought on works done and not on slogans and promises.

“This fight is between the two crore people of Delhi and 200 BJP MPs, Chief Ministers from BJP-ruled States and Union Ministers who are have been campaigning. When they come, count all the works done in the last five years and send them back to their States. Do not let them insult Delhi,” he said. Mr. Kejriwal was speaking at a roadshow at Gokalpur Assembly constituency.

“I have worked in Delhi as an elder son of a family. I paid the electricity and water bills like an elder son, I arranged for good education for the children of the family, I took care of the health of the family and arranged for medicines. I arranged for pilgrimage for the elders of the family. And now, forces from across the country have come together to defeat your son,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

All the parties, including BJP, Congress, JD(U), RJD, LJP, have turned against the people of Delhi and are insulting the works that we have done in the last five years, Mr. Kejriwal said.

‘Show them achievements’

He told people that when the “outsiders” would come to visit them, they should show them the achievements of Delhi in the past five years and then ask them to go back and look after their own States instead of delivering speeches in Delhi.

“They will come and insult and find faults in our schools, mohalla clinics, electricity, water, etc. I want to ask the people of Delhi, will you remain quiet and bear the insult? Ask them whether their States have mohalla clinics, and show them one if need be. Ask them about the results achieved by students of the schools in their States and tell them that students in Delhi have received 96%. Ask them if people in theit State get uninterrupted power supply and free water,” Mr. Kejriwal said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/eybhjw/article30678777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29KEJRIWAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-bringing-outsiders-to-campaign-kejriwal/article30678778.ece

321,2020/01/29,EC serves notice on Thakur; BJP MP Verma likely to get one too,"The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Tuesday issued a show-cause notice to Union Minister of State for Finance, Anurag Thakur, over alleged inflammatory statements at a public meeting in Rithala constituency.

At the meeting, Mr. Thakur had called for “shooting down traitors”. The notice also highlighted certain other objectionable statements that were reported by the Delhi Chief Electoral Officer to the ECI.

Model code violation

“The commission is prima facie of the view that by making aforesaid statements which have the potential of disturbing communal harmony and aggravating the existing differences between social and religious communities, you have violated the abovesaid provisions of the Model Code of Conduct [MCC] and the Representation of the People Act, 1951,” the notice stated and asked him to respond by January 30, failing which the commission will take action against him without further reference.

Provisions of the MCC highlighted in the notice include clauses which states that no party or candidate should aggravate differences or create mutual hatred among different communities, that criticism of political opponents be confined to their past record and refrain from criticism of all aspects of their private lies, that there be no appeal to caste or communal feelings, that all parties and candidates shall avoid “corrupt practices”.

The notice also cites Section 125 of the Representation of the People Act, under which any person, who in connection with elections promotes feelings of enmity or hatred on grounds of religion, race, caste, community or language between different classes of citizens, shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term extendable to three years, a fine or both.

Controversial remarks

A report by the CEO on inflammatory statements allegedly made by BJP MP Pravesh Sahib Singh Verma was also received by the ECI, and a show-cause notice will likely be sent to him as well, an official said.

In an interview to a news agency, Mr. Verma said that protesters at Shaheen Bagh, who were opposing the amended Citizenship Act would “enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters and kill them”. The report submitted by the CEO highlighted these statements regarding Shaheen Bagh as well as a tweet regarding religious places, an official said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ec-serves-notice-on-thakur-bjp-mp-verma-likely-to-get-one-too/article30678705.ece
322,2020/01/29,Auto driver moves court over challan for pro-AAP messages,"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought response of the city government, the police and the Election Commission on an auto driver’s plea to declare that displaying ‘I love Kejriwal’ and ‘Sirf Kejriwal’ messages on three-wheelers do not constitute a political advertisement.

Rajesh, a Delhi-based auto driver, moved the High Court after a challan for ₹10,000 was issued to him for displaying the messages on his three-wheeler.

Kejriwal tweets support

Reacting to the story, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted: “The BJP is issuing challans to auto drivers through its police. Their [auto drivers] only offence is that they have written ‘I love Kejriwal’. Such ill-will towards the poor is not good. I appeal to the BJP to stop taking revenge against the poor.”

The counsel for the Election Commission said that action was likely taken for violation of the model code of conduct during which political advertisements are prohibited.

The lawyer representing Rajesh opposed the poll panel’s submission on the ground that it was not a political advertisement and even if it was, it would not be prohibited as it was displayed at personal expense and not by a political party.

He also argued that political advertisements were permitted on the rear, right and left sides of public service vehicles, including autos, under guidelines issued by the Delhi government in 2018.

Advocate Nitin K. Gupta, who filed the petition, said Rajesh had painted the words ‘I love Kejriwal’ and ‘Sirf Kejriwal’ on the back of his auto in September-October 2019 of his own free will. Mr Gupta said his client was stopped by the traffic police on January 15 and challaned ₹10,000 for permit violation under the Motor Vehicles Act.

The plea has claimed that the action was taken without any advance notice by any government department prohibiting such a display. Rajesh also submitted that he belonged to “lower-class and was barely making ends meet by driving an auto”.

Rajesh said the challan was a deliberate attempt to give political colour to the markings of ‘I love Kejriwal’ and curtail his right to free speech and expression.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ogjw7b/article30678562.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DEAUTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/auto-driver-moves-court-over-challan-for-pro-aap-messages/article30678563.ece
323,2020/01/29,"This is a fight between a local boy and a VVIP, says BJP’s Sunil Yadav","“Modi hai to mumkin hai, Shah hai to sambhav hai (If there is [Narendra] Modi it is possible, if there is [Amit] Shah it is achievable)” blared a loudspeaker installed atop an autorickshaw as a humble gathering awaited the arrival of BJP’s purported giant slayer Sunil Yadav at DID Colony near Safdarjung Tomb on Tuesday. The BJP leader will be contesting against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convener Arvind Kejriwal from the New Delhi seat in the Assembly elections on February 8.

A slum cluster nestled along the periphery of a Defence Ministry installation, DID Colony took root nearly 60 years ago with around 70 tenements that gradually transformed into double-storey houses.

Mr. Yadav, a lawyer and chief of the Delhi BJP youth wing, began his day with the inauguration of his election office on Mahadev Road where he declared that the contest in New Delhi was one between a ‘gully boy, Sunil bhaiyya’ and “VVIP, celebrity Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal”.

Whether he was addressing a gathering at posh Golf Links or residents of the slum cluster, Mr. Yadav’s bid to defeat Mr. Kejriwal revolved around highlighting several purported dichotomies, including local versus outsider; accessibility versus inaccessibility; nationalism versus support for “anti-national forces”; and, interestingly, the desire of a “local boy to work for people whom he grew up around as a legislator sans Chief Ministerial ambitions” versus the desire of a CM who “became New Delhi MLA by default” to retain his chair.

A street magician who had taken an imaginary stage to ensure its residents gather around the venue of Mr. Yadav's public meeting and sought to educate them against “selling their votes”, pulled out a saffron BJP sash symbolising vikas (development) and reassembled a rope which he had dismembered moments ago to “show how the BJP believes in uniting the people of India” was almost out of his tricks by the time three SUVs bearing Mr. Yadav's image pulled up.

“I have played cricket and gillidanda with you; I have lived in the servants’ quarters, slums and grown up amongst you. Yes, I live in this constituency; you have all seen me visit during festivals, I have been at your family functions both in good times and bad. How many times did he [Mr. Kejriwal] come here in the last five years?” Mr. Yadav asked the gathering of around a hundred residents.

“Tell me where Kejriwal lives. No one will be able to tell where he stays. If you have some work, where will you go? Shouldn’t he at least have an office here? Where will you go if you need him? He became Chief Minister by default because he had challenged Sheila Dikshit to a contest on her home constituency. After he defeated her, he became the Chief Minister, not because he wanted to serve you,” Mr. Yadav alleged.

Since a significant portion of the New Delhi constituency falls under the jurisdiction of the New Delhi Municipal Council, which has equal representation from both the State government and the Centre, its MLA has “nothing to do” with the schools or dispensaries functioning within it, said Mr. Yadav, attacking two of the sectors at the core of AAP’s campaign.

Arguing that Mr. Kejriwal’s duties as CM had rendered him inaccessible and unavailable as a legislator, Mr. Yadav promised the residents of DID Colony that the issues they faced would be “taken to the highest levels” of the Centre.

As he spoke, party workers distributed pamphlets bearing his image next to that of PM Modi and the slogan “Changed the country, will change New Delhi” written in Hindi.

“Mr. Kejriwal says he cannot work because of Narendra Modi, Amit Shah, or the L-G, but I won’t have that issue,” he added.

As he left the colony to go towards Golf Links, one of the most affluent parts of the Capital, two more SUVs join his cavalcade as it pulled up outside the community centre.

The one-page pamphlets that were distributed at DID Colony were replaced with a ‘biography’, written in Hindi and English, detailing his educational background, a reference to how he “worked his way up the ranks” in the BJP and, among other allegations, stating that Mr. Kejriwal was “well appreciated in Pakistan”.

“I have grown in this party from the bottom up. Mr. Kejriwal is the New Delhi MLA by default. Golf Links is an area which needs beautification, and tackles issues related to the Residents’ Welfare Association, inflated power bills... New Delhi needs a local MLA not a Chief Minister,” he told the gathering.

“A local MLA can work for the good of his constituents but a CM may not have time for the work of his constituency. If I was the MLA, I wouldn’t be refused, my work wouldn’t be stalled – PM Modi’s candidate will obviously do good work as he is being monitored by the PM himself,” he added.

Mr. Yadav also reminded the 50-odd people at Golf Links that Mr. Kejriwal was the same man who caused a gridlock in central Delhi when he sat on protest at Rail Bhavan in 2014, “because he was not invited to attend the Republic Day function... he is the same person who is supporting those causing inconvenience to thousands of people by backing Shaheen Bagh”.

People speak

“Free this, free that; What is the actual meaning of these things he (Mr. Kejriwal) is announcing? How will the government function of it gives everything for free? He is the same person who forgot Anna (Hazare) after using him to become Chief Minister. How can we trust him?” asked Shweta Devi (name changed on request) a resident of the DID colony when asked for comment on Mr. Kejriwal's bid to retain New Delhi.

Nandi Devi, a resident of DID Colony, said: “We have not made up our mind yet; we don’t want anyone specifically to lose — whether Kejriwal or Modi; both governments have done good things. Mr. Kejriwal has helped build a toilet and improved the drains and sewage system in addition to building roads here but the BJP is talking about giving us flats in lieu of our dwellings in this colony. It can swing either way.”

Saraswati Singh, another resident of the colony, said that the BJP government’s in-situ rehabilitation policy for slum clusters “sounded very good”.

“We have heard about the scheme but we are unsure whether it will actually happen,” she said.

Sukhram, a former NDMC employee, said: “We want flats; the BJP has given us some paperwork but we don’t trust it at the moment.”

A resident of Golf Links, who did not wish to be identified, said: “I have a lot of faith in Mr. Yadav due to my personal experience. I remember very clearly how a year ago our RWA got in touch with him to get some potholes repaired and he delivered on his promise within days.”

Another resident who identified herself as Mrs. Bhasin said, “He is right about Kejriwal; I still remember the inconvenience we all had to face for over a week when he sat on protest at Rail Bhavan. That's not how a Chief Minister is supposed to function.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4vpy0v/article30678859.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29BJPDID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/this-is-a-fight-between-a-local-boy-and-a-vvip/article30678495.ece
324,2020/01/29,BJP to petition Governor,"State BJP president K Laxman asserted that the would “fight politically and judicially” against the ruling TRS party’s “unholy practice” of snatching away two coveted posts of Tukkuguda municipality, where elections were held recently.

Party leaders will first meet Governor Dr. Tamilisai Soundararajan on Thursday and appraise her about ruling party’s “illegal practices and irregularities” during municipal elections, he said, addressing a gathering at Srinagar village in Tukkuguda municipality on Wednesday.

Mr. Laxman alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is unable to digest the victory of the BJP in municipal elections and had adopted “backdoor tactics” to usurp control of the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). He charged the TRS party of having violated democratic norms in grabbing the chairman and vice-chairman posts despite the BJP winning nine out of the 15 seats, and thereby having a clear majority in the municipality.

“The ruling party has used ex-officio members and Rajya Sabha member K. Keshav Rao, violating all norms. How can Mr. Rao exercise his vote in Telangana when his name is listed for Andhra Pradesh as per the Parliament bulletin,” he questioned during his visit to the village to bolster the morale of the local leaders and party cadre.

The BJP chief said that the people of Tukkuguda and in other urban local bodies had voted for the party expecting good work in the civic development and for the welfare of the poor but the TRS party resorted to unethical means to seize control of the municipality.

The party has won a “moral victory” in many municipalities and municipal corporations as its candidates had performed well despite the misuse of official machinery. The Rajya Sabha Chairman would also be apprised of the TRS party’s “irregularities and malpractices” in the ULB polls, he said.

The demands of the UFBU include wage revision settlement at 20% hike on pay slip components with adequate loading thereof; five-day banking; and uniform definition of business hours, lunch hour in branches.

Merger of special allowance with basic pay; scrapping of new pension scheme (NPS); exemption from income tax on retirement benefits without ceiling, defined working hours for officers and equal wage for equal work for contract employees / business correspondents are some of the other demands.

Besides the two day strike, the UFBU, which consists of AIBEA, AIBOC, NCBE, AIBOA, BEFI, INBEF, INBOC, NOBW and NOBO, has proposed a three-day strike from March 11 and indefinite strike beginning April 1.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/call-for-two-day-bank-strike-from-january-31/article30686586.ece
332,2020/01/29,"SCB officer assaults Transco employee, cases against both","A woman officer of the Secunderabad Cantonment Board allegedly assaulted a Transco employee on Wednesday after he allegedly used derogatory language against her. Police booked cases against both.

The Marredpally police said the incident took place at Picket where the Transco employee, identified as Dashrath Ram Reddy, who works as a line inspector, was constructing a house on a piece of land which is administered by the SCB. They said that around four months ago he had sought permission for construction. His application, however, was returned for want of relevant documents. Despite this, Reddy allegedly continued with construction work.

Police said Reddy approached the Telangana High Court, seeking directions that the SCB not interfere in the construction work. The court then ordered status quo.

“SCB surveyor Saritha went to the site to serve the notice. However, Dashrath Ram Reddy did not take it. Then, the notice was pasted on the structure. When she was returning, he instigated Saritha and made an allegation that she had demanded money. Upset at the allegation, she assaulted him,” said Marredpally inspector M Niranjan Reddy.

While Saritha approached the police with a complaint, the Transco employee too submitted his complaint.

333,2020/01/29,Contempt case: 4-week jail for SI,"The Telangana High Court sentenced S.R. Nagar SI Ashok Naik to four weeks’ imprisonment, holding him guilty in a case of contempt of court.

The petitioner, Ramadugu Omkar Varma, facing a case of cheating and outraging a woman’s modesty, approached the HC, alleging that the SI had not served him the mandatory notice under Section 41-A of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) before arresting him. This was in violation of the apex court’s verdict in the Arnesh Kumar vs State of Bihar and constituted contempt of court.

Passing the judgment, Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao imposed a fine of ₹2,000 on the SI. The sentence, however, was suspended for six weeks, giving an opportunity to the SI to go in appeal. The Hyderabad Police Commissioner and the Home Secretary were directed to initiate action against the SI.

A woman, K. Padma, had complained to police that Varma had collected ₹10,000 from her, promising to help her find a treasure trove in her house.

She had accused him of outraging her modesty when she went to his house seeking return of money as he could not find any treasure trove. Based on her complaint, the police filed a First Information Report (FIR) under Sections 420, 354 and 509 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Varma contended that as per the SC verdict in the Arnesh Kumar case, the SI should have given him notice since the sections of law invoked against him had less than seven years of imprisonment as punishment. The judgment said that there were, however, some exceptions. One among them was that a police officer could arrest a person if he was satisfied that the arrest was necessary to prevent the accused from committing further offences.

The investigator should record the reasons for effecting the arrest.

“The FIR does not mention the date when the petitioner is supposed to have met the complainant and promised to find hidden treasure trove....” the verdict said.

Prima facie, the complaint itself was very vague, the judge observed. “There has been a deprivation of personal liberty” by the SI, the judgment said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/contempt-case-4-week-jail-for-si/article30686295.ece

335,2020/01/29,Jagan’s petition in HC posted for February 6,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy did not get any immediate relief in the Telangana High Court on Tuesday in the criminal petitions he had filed, seeking exemption from appearance in CBI special court here.Justice G. Sri Devi of the HC granted seven days to the CBI for filing counter affidavit in the petitions filed by Mr. Reddy. When the petitions came up for hearing, CBI counsel Surender sought one week to file counter.

With CBI counsel seeking time, no arguments could be presented by Mr. Reddy’s counsel. Granting a week, the judge posted the matter for February 6. Mr. Reddy was facing a batch of quid pro quo cases registered by the CBI against him. The investigators had filed 11 charge-sheets. Based on the information and content furnished in these charge-sheets, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered cases against him and filed five charge-sheets.

Mr. Reddy had been attending the court in these cases since 2013, after being released from prison. He was arrested by the CBI in 2012. After he became Chief Minister of AP in 2019, his counsel had been filing petitions in the CBI special court securing exemption from his appearance.

However, the special court insisted on Mr. Reddy’s appearance and, accordingly, he appeared before principal special judge B. R. Madhusudhan Rao on January 9 for the first time in his capacity as CM. His counsel again secured permission for exemption during the subsequent adjournments.

However, the CBI special court told his counsel on January 24 that Mr. Reddy’s petitions to dispense with his presence could not be allowed every time and his presence was required during next hearing, that is, January 31.

337,2020/01/29,‘India most cyber-attacked country’,"India is the most cyber-attacked country in the world, revealed National Cyber Security (NCS) coordinator Lieutenant General Rajesh Pant while inaugurating the Cyber-security Centre of Excellence on Tuesday.

“The reason for India being most cyber-attack prone is our numbers. We have 600 million internet users. It is not because our cyber hygiene is not good,” Lt. Gen. Pant said. He opined that internet was being used by a large number of people, who may not be well-educated and therefore vulnerable to cyber-attacks by hackers.

He also pointed out that mobile phones were involved in 90% of cyber crime and that digital forensics for mobiles have become an important area. “If it is something like WhatsApp, there is an end-to-end encryption and you cannot get information. So, this is a big area where crimes are taking place. But, the number of cases of solving crime is low,” he said.

On incidents of facial recognition software being used in the State through the prism of consent, he said that Personal Data Protection Bill seeks to bring about safeguards, and will define sensitive and critical data. CCTV cameras have been instrumental in solving crimes. Touching upon the ‘ongoing’ debate between security and privacy, and the Disha case, he said, “What happened in Hyderabad would not have been solved without CCTV cameras. Whether the bill comes or not, that is besides the point. Security is more important.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/india-most-cyber-attacked-country/article30678302.ece
338,2020/01/29,Tabla meets beatboxing,"Growing up in Jaipur, Ilyas Raphael Khan was exposed to traditional tabla playing through his grandfather, and started learning at the age of five. When he was 10, he heard the contemporary vocal percussion form of beatboxing. The tabla player decided to blend the two, and began giving shows under the stage name Tablaboxing (Ilyas Raphael Khan). “I wanted to combine the old art with the new form to create something unique,” he says.

Khan is one of the performers at the RagaMoon 2020 music festival to be held in Gorai over the weekend. Other artistes in the line-up are German fusion multi-instrumentalist Prem Joshua, fusion act Vasu Dixit Collective, sitar player Mehtab Ali Niazi and Harpreet Singh, who composes tunes out of works of well-known poets.

The festival attracts a small community of music lovers who come together to celebrate music in natural surroundings. It is held over a 24-hour period in which performances are interspersed with workshops.

In rhythm

For his part, Khan will do a solo set with beatboxing, tabla and loops. “I will be doing my own compositions besides some well-known pieces. Instead of using traditional tabla bols, I use new syllables or beatboxing to illustrate rhythms,” he says. The family of Khan’s father, Hameed Kawa Khan has seen seven generations of musicians.

He says, “I come from a mixed background, with a French mother. As I was trained in traditional music, I initially didn't tell my father about my love for beatboxing. I did my first tablaboxing show at the age of 12, and when my father saw it to my surprise he was actually happy.”

Khan first discovered the musical form when he heard Jason Singh from the UK. He recalls, “I taught myself through YouTube videos and later learnt from my idol Alem, world champion in beatboxing. I was fortunate to perform with him on many occasions,” he says. Besides Alem, Khan’s other big influence has been tabla maestro Ustad Zakir Hussain. “I am inspired by the way they live their lives, and their philosophy. Musically, I don’t focus on any genre. I listen to everything from Indian folk to world music forms like Celtic and Arabic music, western classical, dubstep, hip-hop and Bollywood,” smiles Khan.

Evolving tradition

Besides recording a tablaboxing EP, Khan has shot many music videos and collaborated with global artistes. He says, “The response to my shows abroad has been great, and I am happy to represent Indian music and culture.”

Khan believes it is important to evolve, while giving due respect to music’s traditional roots. “This way we don’t lose our heritage and the young generation will enjoy it in today’s style,” asserts Khan.

339,2020/01/29,Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy to perform at The Shakti Foundation’s 2020 concert in Chennai,"It has been seven years since Vishwaroopam released, the last original Tamil movie that iconic trio Shankar Mahadevan, Ehsaan Noorani and Loy Mendonsa gave music for. But at Gurucarana, The Shakti Foundation’s annual fundraiser, the trio will bring its trademark high energy performance to Chennai audiences, with a mix of Tamil and Hindi songs.

This is not the first time that SEL, as they are known, have been part of The Shakti Foundation’s concerts. They had performed in 2016, and in 2017, Shankar had performed along with Ranjit Barot. Incidentally, it was Ranjit who had helped found the trio, by roping in Shankar for a Pepsi ad to work with Ehsaan and Loy.

“We have always been supporters of The Shakti Foundation; they do very good work in rehabilitating people with physical challenges,” says Ehsaan over a phone call from Mumbai. Started in 1991, The Shakti Foundation is Velan Raghuvir’s attempt to integrate people with physical challenges into the mainstream, as well as provide medical facilities to people in rural areas.

For their show this time, Ehsaan looks forward to performing their popular songs, including ones with an underlying motivational theme to fit the cause. Apart from that, Shankar will be performing songs from his Tamil repertoire (In the last couple of years, ‘Vettikattu’ from Viswasam, ‘Maaradha’ from Sangathamizhan, ‘Thanga Sela’ from Kaala were decent hits.) “There is no way that Shankar can come to Chennai and not perform his Tamil songs,” laughs Ehsaan.

So far, the trio has been mostly busy with Bollywood (“The Tamil film industry is comfortable with its own composers, and fairly so,” says Ehsaan) — working, most recently, in Chhapaak and Panga. Composing music for Chhapaak was an enjoyable challenge, according to him. “It is not a naturally musical film, and neither was Raazi. But Meghna (Gulzar) definitely wanted songs because it helps the narrative. A lot more work was up to Gulzar, to make sure the lyrics convey the mood of the film.”

Chhapaak’s music, Ehsaan believes, was simple, but lyrically and melodically deep — which is exactly what the trio looks for. “Trying to fit a song in contemporary genres would be the worst thing to do, because everybody is trying that. What you have to concentrate on is good songwriting: then you can dress it up in any style — rock, pop, hip hop.”

These words come from the trio’s experience of 25 years. In a world where bands break up all the time, he divulges how it has managed to stick together.

“Like in any relationship, there are ups and downs, arguments. But you should never forget the bigger picture — the music. That is why you are here. Which means you have to leave everything else at home, especially your ego.”

The trio is fondly called the Amar-Akbar-Anthony of India’s music industry. How do they then feel about the atmosphere created by the passing of the Citizenship Amendment Act, which has caused widespread protests across the country?

Asked whether they would address it, he says, “In such a sensitive environment, you have to be careful of what you say, or don’t say. Each of us [the trio] has our own stands on these things, but what matters is that we stick together. Moreover, there are much bigger issues of progress, education... that you can’t lose focus of. I think our presence, the fact that the three of us are sticking together, speaks for itself.”

340,2020/01/29,Inside the world of mridangam makers,"Johnson Kennedy catches me staring at his palms — rough, ashy sores on the sides, hardened from years of working with wood and rope. “You can be sure one is a mridangam maker if he has these scars,” he responds, with a smile.

Also read: An excerpt from 'Sebastian & Sons'

He belongs to one of the oldest and largest families of mridangam makers from Thanjavur, whose journey is the binding narrative thread that Carnatic music vocalist TM Krishna has chosen for his just-released book, Sebastian & Sons (Context - Westland Publications).

The book is an exploration of both the aesthetic craft of mridangam making, and the social exclusion of craftsman from the music. Over the four years that he worked on Sebastian & Sons, TM Krishna spoke to makers from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.

“We were looking to release a fresh edition of my 2013 book, A Southern Music. In it, there was a chapter on caste discrimination but no mention of the instrument makers,” he says, adding, “I started typing out a paragraph on the makers to be added, but realised quickly that this has to be a book in itself. It is far more complicated and needs its own voice, not mine.”

Following in the author’s footsteps in Chennai, we head to Appaswamy Street in Mylapore, to meet Johnson Kennedy, grandson of Sebastian, one of the earliest recorded mridangam makers.

It is after Pongal, and sales have seen a dip from the productive Margazhi season. Yet, when we meet Johnson, he is with a customer, putting the final touches to a mridangam. Cradling the instrument between his legs, he applies a black paste to the left head, rotates it bit by bit, and at every turn, slaps it to check the tone. “This will increase the bass,” he informs us.

Mridangam 101 The percussive instrument is cylindrical, and made of jackfruit wood. The frame is curved, and narrowed towards the ends by a lathe machine.

The dominant circular membranes are made of cow hide, and in the middle, goat hide braided together. On the goat skin is a paste of black rice and puranakittan stone. The other membrane is made of buffalo and goat hide.

The membranes are tightened together with the help of nylon ropes (it was leather earlier) running along the entire length.

It is the specific nature of the hide that makes it difficult to industrialise the process. “Each animal’s skin differs. A female that has delivered twice is preferred, for better stretchability,” says Krishna.

In the summer months, it takes about four days to make a mridangam. But in the winter months, when demand is high, it stretches up to a week. “The leather for both heads has to be wetted and takes a longer time to dry in winter, because of the rains. It will stink if we use it before drying,” he says.

Working with skin — cow, buffalo, goat — is inextricable to the making of a mridangam, and the reason for the makers’ social exclusion. From acquiring skins for the membranes, to sourcing wood, curing the material and putting it together, it is a highly nuanced operation. “Translating the musician’s abstract ideas into the corporeal reality of a mrdangam requires a highly tuned ear. Yet the makers’ contribution to the art of the mrdangam is dismissed as labour and repair — when it is spoken of at all,” writes Krishna in his book.

Every maker needs to have a good sense of music, to understand the needs of the musician. And yet, “nobody from the community of mridangam makers has gone into making music. Those who have tried their hand, have also fallen back to making the instrument,” says Krishna. They will be relegated to playing devotional music, church music, koothu, but don’t have the opportunity to learn Carnatic.

“I cannot play a Carnatic song, obviously,” says Johnson, “But I like playing movie songs from the 1960s at some gatherings. Even if I want to learn, I can’t because my hands are worn out.”

Not everyone works with skin, and so players depend on the makers, giving them some power back. However, this very fact keeps them in the job.

Binding ties

Right at the beginning of Mathala Narayana Street, two shops nestle beside each other. One is a veena repair shop, the other in a blue brighter than the sky, is Varadan’s mridangam repair shop.

The shop is older than Varadan; he joined the tutelage of his uncle, KM Venkatesan, a respected mridangam manufacturer, at the age of 11. He was brought from Tiruvallur to learn the trade, and considers himself a Madras native. Now 70, he comes to this shop everyday from his residence in Aynavaram — despite business being slow. “There was a time my uncle was the only major manufacturer in Chennai,” he says. But now, according to Johnson, there are at least 25 shops in Chennai, “of which five belong to me”.

This stronghold by the Thanjavur makers, especially Antony and his sons, has not gone unnoticed. In his book, Krishna touches upon the professional competition between the different families of makers, a grudging respect and sometimes — mutual disdain. But what binds them all is a love for the instrument, and the experience of being marginalised.

Johnson recognises this business as their family identity, but admits it is not easy. “No one was willing to marry me for a long time. Everyone thought this was a menial job.” He talks about how house owners refuse to rent their spaces for this business, because it involves skin work. “You are here with me for the past hour, were you able to smell anything bad?” he asks us, in angst.

At Varadan’s shop, the walls are covered with photos of his uncle and him next to famous mridangam players. “Thanjavur Murugaboopathi, Vellore Ramabhadran, Trichy Sankaran...,” he enunciates their names like chants. “These are vidwans. But it is only if we make the instrument properly that they get the fame and awards.” Artistes have treated them with respect, he insists. But later he lets on, “Respect is nice, but it is not a pension.”

And so, steering away from his father’s business, Varadan’s son has found himself a job in the Electricity Board. After 75 years of existence, the iconic shop may shut down in a year or two.

341,2020/01/29,A perfect fit,"A melodious number done decades ago now finds a permanent place on the big screen for Raghu Dixit. “All I can say is that 2020 seems lucky as one special song that I had done 25 years ago is finding a niche in (Darling) Krishna’s directorial debut Love Mocktail to be released in theatres on January 31. It’s a soulful special track, as the lyrics and the melody unbelievably match with the storyline and the mood. And we have received unprecedented response from music lovers on social media,” says Raghu Dixit.

Love Mocktail jointly produced by director Krishna and Milana Nagaraj, who also play the lead roles has Amrutha Iyengar as one of the heroines, along with the cast Rachana Inder and Abhilash. Consider the lyrics that is stirring, even poignant as it progresses says Raghu. “Kanna haniyondu kannalle thoogi, Yeke heegondu baara edheyolage” (Even as my tear holds on to my eye, why does it seem to weigh more on my heart) are lyrics written by Raghavendra V Kamath and sung by Raghu. “I am happy the song has found the right space as it will linger in people’s mind even as they leave the theatre,” he adds.

“Kanna haniyondu” is one of Raghu’s initial few tunes composed when he had just started off with the guitar, but never had the opportunity to use it. “I had proposed it to many filmmakers who did not see a connect with their movies earlier. All of a sudden I jumped on the number when Krishna and Milana started telling me the storyline, and discussed on points where song-tracks could be introduced. The song fitted the low-point segment of the film where the protagonist and his girl don’t see their love taking any concrete route. Their dreams seem threatened, links broken. It’s the unrest that brings out their mood in this song,” says Raghu who even loves the soft flute, acoustic guitar and the vocal humming in the background score adding to the emotional drama.

There are six songs and a promotional in the movie, while five are available on YouTube on the Raghu Dixt Music label. “Four songs amongst these are written by Raghavendra, whom I am professionally working with for the last decade. “We have an encouraging working relationship which is casual and yet brimming with abundant criticism amongst us. It makes it richer and beneficial to both. After all, Raghavendra is the same person who made people notice his lyrics for Just Maathmathalli for the number “Munjaane Manjalli,” says Raghu.

People will get to hear my music for the next seven months, says Raghu feeling happy that he is back with a bang after six years of silence in films. He is happy that the year will see seven big-screen releases this year starting with Love Mocktail, followed by Ninna Sanihake which will feature the late Kannada idol Rajkumar’s grand-daughter Dhanya Ramkumar for the first time, along with Suraj Gowda. Orchestra will be the third film with an unusual musical storyline that speaks of the Orchestra culture on Mysuru roads.

342,2020/01/29,Melodies for Bapu,"Bengaluru will host a novel programme as a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on January 30, his 72nd death anniversary, which also marks the culmination of the ongoing 150th birth anniversary celebrations. Well known musician, author and columnist, Sakuntala Narasimhan, has a specially curated musical where she has chosen songs from a book of bhajans she bought from the Gandhi ashram.

“The book has songs chosen by the Mahatma,” says Sakuntala. “He also wrote the foreword in January 1948. We have selected eight songs in different languages. I will compere the programme, and join my students Archana Udupa, Sugama Sangeeta artiste and trained Hindustani singer Dipali Chakravarty.

Sakuntala had attended a prayer meeting by Gandhiji at Birla House in Delhi two weeks before he was shot. “I was also taken to his funeral at India Gate. I was only seven years old then but my memories remain untarnished.” Sakuntala will introduce each song with reminiscences which would include inputs from Gandhians around the country and her own observations at the Gandhi ashram in Ahmedabad.

The programme will have songs in Sanskrit, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada (a translation of ‘Lead Kindly Light,’ one of Gandhiji’s favourite hymns) Bengali and Bhojpuri. The book is over 200 pages, with over a 100 songs. Gandhiji presumably used these in his prayer meetings, says Sakuntala, although he does not say why he chose these particular songs. “There are devotional songs by Meerabai, Kabir, Tulsidas, Narsi Mehta, Nanak, a Hebrew song, a few Bengali songs and some verses from the Mukundamala.”

Sakuntala has selected bhajans such as ‘Hari Tum Haro’, recorded by MS Subbulakshmi at the Mahatma’s request, ‘Vaishnava Janato’, ‘Raghupati Raghava’ and ‘Payo ji Maine’ (popularised by Paluskar). “I have written on Gandhi’s ideas and economics. My father too believed in Gandhian ideals, maybe that influenced my outlook.”

Remembering Gandhiji’s funeral, Sakuntala says, “I saw a sea of humanity at the funeral procession. There was not an inch of open space. People had walked from villages, all night, to offer their last respects to the Mahatma. My father hoisted me on his shoulders so that I could see the cortège as it passed by.”

Sakuntala remembers the sun shining on Gandhiji’s head, and Nehru sitting in front of the carriage, slumped in grief. “As I tuned in to Akashvani on January 30 evening to listen to my mother singing, I heard the mourning music play. When my mother came home she said how everyone at the broadcasting house, were crying. Dinner was not cooked that evening in most houses, including ours.”

At the funeral she recollects her friend, Padma Swaminathan, a Gandhian who wore only khadi, pulling the carriage carrying the mahatma’s asthi for immersion in the sea at Chennai. “While researching, I got valuable inputs from a retired IAS officer in Chennai who is a Gandhian from Gujarat. He sent me some details about the songs, which I plan to mention briefly.”

Songs for the Mahatma will be from 11 am to12 noon on January 30 at Nightingales Enrichment Centre, opposite Chhaya Nursing Home, 17th cross, Malleswaram. Open to all. Call 9731192652 for details

Many reasons

Singer Archana Udupa feels honoured to be a part of this event for more than one reason. “First of all I am sharing the stage with my guru, which is always a great learning experience. We are not only singing some of the Mahatma’s favourite bhajans but also getting to hear the stories and anecdotes from someone who attended prayer meetings conducted by Gandhiji himself.”

Different platform

Dipali Chakravarty, trained in classical music, is happy to be part of the event. “It is going to be a different platform and I am happy to do my bit, singing Bengali songs.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/vanvlp/article30684088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BGMRANJANI3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bapu-and-bhajans/article30684089.ece
343,2020/01/29,"Swaraag wows Hyderabad with their fusion of Sufi, folk, indie and Bollywood tracks","In 2014, with a zitar, saxophone, acoustic guitar and tabla, the instrumental band Swaraag was launched in Rajasthan. They did gigs, performed at events and also played at weddings. “At weddings, when we saw people rushing to us, with their dinner plates in hand, to listen to us, we knew we were on the right track, because at weddings, the focus is mainly on socialising and food. Yet, we were able to divert their attention to our music,” laughs Pratap Singh Nirwan, the man who formed Swaraag.

Swaraag comes from Swa-self, raag-raga, “a person in perfect harmony with music,” elaborates Pratap. Swaraag that is acknowledged as a folk-fusion band, features Pratap Singh Nirwan (founder/team coach), Asif Khan (lead singer), Arif Khan (zitar), Tasruf Ali (saxophone), Rishab Rozar (guitar), Arif Khan (khartal/morchang player), Sajid Khan (drummer) and Saif Ali Khan (tabla player). The band aims to bring the best of traditional Rajasthani music in amalgam with modern instruments to create a mellifluous experience for the audience. Pratap recollects, “Some time after we launched Swaraag, we realised that being an instrumental band restricted our audience. So we roped in Arif’s brother Asif and a trained vocalist with Sufi singing as his forte. Along with him we brought in a morchang khartal player and a drummer.”

After the band reassembled and heard each other play together, the team was happy. “The music, the song selection and the mood picked up instantly. We started with Sufi songs and then went onto include three more genres — Rajasthnai folk, Indie fusion and Bollywood mashup,” says Pratap.

Introduction of drums and mochang khartal brought in a different energy to the band. And people’s curiosity to see an artiste play the khartaal was immense. That made Swaraag explore the option of promoting Indian folk instruments. “When a members of the audience approache us to take a close look at the different instruments, we allow them to touch and feel it and sometimes, even try it if they want to,” says Arif.

With over 1000 performances worldwide, the band’s unique blend of zitar and saxophone with drum and tabla in Sufi and Bollywood songs portrays their versatility in performing all possible genres of Indian music. Even though they perform a lot of Nusrat Fateh ali Khan’s kalams, they also play their own music occasionally. Swaraag’s music expresses the deep-rooted thoughts of one’s heart with their simple lyrics. “Our shows have made us look at live performances as an ‘energy exchange’ programme. But the onus to ignite the mood rests entirely on the artiste/band.”

With their sound training, band members know how to help each other for a better performance. “When we are rendering Bollywood numbers, our drummer takes the responsibility to lead the team, similarly when it is Rajasthani folk, Arif leads. The coordination is so beautiful that the members just signal each other without anyone realising and that makes them play flawlessly,” says Pratap.

The band members however, insist there’s still a lot to learn; every stage performance turns into a learning experience. “We participated in the TV reality show Rising Stars to see where we stand, to understand what makes us unique or how we can improve. It was overwhelming to see the support and cheer for that. Having met us at the show, Shankar Mahadevan recorded songs with us; with that our entire recording knowledge took a 360 degree turn,” shares Pratap. Arif adds, “He showed how one can improve at a recording studio, improvise instantly, use a whistle or a clap to give different moods to the music.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/9snnnl/article30683288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Swaraag-Band-New-image-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/swaraag-indie-fusion-band/article30683289.ece
344,2020/01/29,Safeguarding schoolchildren from cybercriminals,"The Kochi Police Commissionerate has set up cybersecurity clubs in 140 schools within the city limits as it gears up to make an all-out effort to safeguard youngsters and equip them against falling prey to cybercriminals at a time when mobile phones have become a ubiquitous presence cutting across age profiles.

The cybersecurity clubs have been established to educate students about the threats posed by the criminals on the Internet and how to safeguard oneself against cyberthreats while using the Internet or digital devices.

During the monthly sessions, the do’s and don’ts of cybersecurity, practical tips of securing devices and the standard operating procedure for safe Internet usage are taught. So far, 66 such cybersecurity sessions have been conducted.

“We have roped in two agencies to design a dedicated content for the cybersecurity clubs along the lines of a popular education app. The idea is to create a user-friendly content stripped of jargon. We plan to make it available free through our online and social media platforms,” said Vijay Sakhare, Inspector General and District Police Chief (Kochi City). The topics to be covered in the module being created for cyberclubs include the safe use of social media, how to safeguard against cyberthreats, signs of mobile phone addictiveness and ways to deal with it, how to enhance cybersecurity of gadgets, how to deal with cyberbullying and stalking, precautions to be taken while conducting online financial transactions, and how to prevent oneself from becoming prey to social engineering.

345,2020/01/29,Mayor warns of action against apartments,"The Kochi Corporation is likely to take action against Choice Marina apartments in Palluruthy for flouting several building rules, Mayor Soumini Jain announced at the council meeting here on Tuesday.

According to a report prepared by the local body’s assistant executive engineer and presented at the council meeting, the building has not received the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) no objection certificate (NOC). It is also currently functioning without valid fire and rescue and pollution control certificates, the report said.

Permit expired

The apartment’s building permit, though renewed twice, had expired in 2017. Since it does not have a valid building permit as per the Kerala Municipality Building Rules (KMBR), an occupancy certificate cannot be issued, the report said.

A no-objection certificate granted by the fire and rescue services expired last year, the report said. Consent from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board has also expired. The report also specified that though around 20 cents of land had been leased for the building, the lease has not been renewed.

Complaints raised

In April 2015, complaints were raised that the building did not have a CRZ no-objection certificate. It was later found that the party had not directly applied for CRZ clearance.

“With the council being convinced that the building was flouting several rules, further action will be determined and taken, after a detailed file is prepared,” Ms. Jain said.

The report was presented after a few councillors raised the matter of the building's permits at the previous council meeting and Ms. Jain asked for a report on the matter.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/mayor-warns-of-action-against-apartments/article30680932.ece
346,2020/01/29,Council rejects panel proposal,"The Kochi Corporation council on Tuesday refused to accept a proposal to set aside 10 acres at Brahmapuram to dispose of waste generated by the demolition of the four flats at Maradu.

As per a directive from the State Level Appraisal Committee for Solid Waste Management in October last year, the Corporation was required to set aside land for the disposal of debris from the demolition and use the site in future for the construction of a demolition waste processing facility. Opposition leader K.J. Antony raised the question of how the committee had issued such a directive without running it past the Corporation council first, particularly since the civic body was in charge of waste management at Brahmapuram. Mayor Soumini Jain informed the council that she was not included in the committee or the decision made by it. “The land at Brahmapuram belongs to the State government and the Corporation is only a requisitioning agency. The civic body is bound to implement the State-level committee’s directive,” she said. But without the council’s agreement, no action could be taken.

Other matters with regard to waste management at Brahmapuram have not received the council’s nod.

The trommels unit, a sort of filtering mechanism for waste, which currently functions in a dilapidated building, is to be replaced at a cost of around ₹2 crore. The civic body is also in the process of hiring contractors to biomine the legacy waste at the site and set up a leachate treatment plant as per a notice from the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. Opposition members have asked for all decisions pertaining to the plant, some pending with the council for months, to be placed on hold. “A special council meeting is necessary to discuss all aspects of waste management at Brahmapuram rather than a piecemeal approval of funds. If the waste-to-energy plant materialises, the leachate plant will become redundant. To avoid that, the plant would also have to be equipped to deal with sewage. Such technical issues need to be discussed in detail,” said V.P.

347,2020/01/29,‘Bell of Faith’ to cover more elderly people,"Subadra Ramaswamy has been sleeping a lot better over the past seven months.

Fated to live alone after her husband departed five years ago and blood cancer took her only son away more than half-a-century ago, the 78-year-old now finds comfort in a new companion, albeit an immovable one, installed by Ernakulam rural police at her home at Uliyannoor near Aluva.

She is among the 100-odd elderly people who have benefited from the emergency bell installed by the Rural police under the Bell of Faith programme for ensuring the safety of elderly people living alone. In the event of an emergency or distress, they can press the remote of the bell triggering an alarm loud enough to alert the neighbours who could rush for their help.

“It does give a sense of security for aged people like me living alone,” said Ms. Ramaswamy. The police have collected the mobile numbers of the beneficiaries and their immediate neighbours as part of the project.

The bells were installed using nearly ₹1.50 lakh received from the Government. “The programme has evoked good response and we are trying to mobilise more funds through residents’ associations and corporate social responsibility funds of public sector units to reach out to more elderly people living alone,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural).

M.R. Madhubabu, nodal officer for Janamaithri Police, Ernakulam Rural, said that beat officers had been asked to check whether the bells were in working condition once in a while.

The district Rural police have linked up homes of elderly people living alone with local police stations with the help of BSNL whereby the land phone serve as a hotline. “The beneficiary only needs to pick up and hold the receiver of the phone for around eight seconds and a connection will be established with the police station concerned,” said Mr. Karthik.

So far, 177 such hotlines have been established with plans to cover more households.

348,2020/01/29,Licence denied to duty-free shop,"The Customs Department has denied licence to a company that had previously run a duty-free shop at the Thiruvananthapuram international airport, citing a criminal case registered against it for dubious operations and tax evasion.

No duty-free shop has been functioning at the airport since the department suspended the licence issued to Plus Max Duty Free Private Limited nearly two years ago.

The matter was raised at the Airport Advisory Committee meeting chaired by Shashi Tharoor, MP, earlier this month.

Ruling out issuing of licence to the company to resume operations, the department has asked the Airports Authority of India (AAI) to float a fresh tender inviting bids from other duty-free operators. “The Special Warehouse Licensing Regulations specifically stipulates that no company with a criminal case against it can be issued licence for duty-free operations,” Customs Department sources said.

Tax evasion

The department has issued notice to the company for alleged tax evasion to the tune of ₹16 crore on account of illegal sale of imported liquor outside the duty-free shop by securing unauthorised access to nearly 13,000 passport numbers.

Besides, the Anti-Corruption Bureau of the Central Bureau of Investigation in Kochi has registered case against Luke K. George, a Customs Superintendent who allegedly facilitated unauthorised access to the passport numbers; Prakadeesh Kumar, managing director of the company, and his father Suryaprakasam R; R. Sundaravasan, CEO; and other staff of the company.

Mr. George has been absconding for more than two years. But the Customs Audit Commissionerate was yet to take any action against him, sources said.

The alleged dubious operations of the company again came to the fore earlier this month when the Prohibition Enforcement Wing of the Coimbatore police arrested four staff of the same company with 62 bottles of imported liquor, which were allegedly diverted from the duty-free shop run by the company at the Coimbatore airport.

“It soon emerged that the Customs had interrogated two of the staff when they were working at the Thiruvananthapuram duty-free shop. In fact, one of them was found to have illegally procured two liquor bottles against his passport during his tenure at the Thiruvananthapuram airport,” sources said.

Thiruvananthapuram airport sources said that the impasse over the absence of duty-free shop would be resolved shortly.

“We will look into the many aspects of the present situation and take a decision accordingly,” a senior airport official said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/licence-denied-to-duty-free-shop/article30678820.ece

351,2020/01/29,Kottakkal Devadas’ strength is his versatility,"Vazhenkada, a small village in Malappuram district, is better known for its Narasimha temple and Kathakali. The village, made famous by Kathakali maestro Vazhenkada Kunju Nair, now boasts several artistes, chief of whom is Kottakkal Devadas.

Devadas is renowned for playing villainous Thadi or Kari characters like Dussasana, Veerabhadra, Kali and Nakrathundi, with their towering presence, bulging eyes and piercing roars. But Devadas’ performance goes beyond that. What sets him apart is that even through the heavy facial make-up of a Thadi character his expansive face can express emotions. He not only creates a huge impact, he provides a histrionic experience.

Sharath A Haridasan, director of the two-hour documentary in the making Stage On Fire, explains why he chose Devadas as his subject: “To me, Kottakkal Devadas is a bridge that connects the past and present. He's a huge influence on Kathakali’s future too. He’s loved by a majority of the liberal section of the older generation of Kathakali lovers as well as admired by the younger generation. He has been instrumental in bringing several youngsters to become viewers of Kathakali.”

Friday Review talks to Devadas, the 54-year-old versatile Kathakali artist who impresses with the entire spectrum of roles from hero to villain to comic, a Kathakali actor with a fan club. Excerpts from an interview:

Why did you decide to focus on Thadi characters? Was it a natural choice because of your big build?

I never wanted to do Thadi characters. In fact, my dream was to do Kathi roles such as Ravana and Duryodhana. I came into Thadi roles by chance. One day, the late Kottakkal Murali, who specialised in Thadi roles, was down with fever and my guru asked me if I could step in. I readily accepted since I didn’t have much else to do. Later Murali left the profession after an accident and gradually these roles fell to me. I used that chance and put all my energy into it. I resolved to prove Thadi characters could act. We are not just big strong guys that come on stage only to die. Then Kalamandalam Ramachandran Unnithan, another Thadi specialist, introduced me to southern Kerala. I grabbed that chance. I ensured I was noticed. But this road was long and hard and one full of struggles and heartaches.

Then let us go back and start at the beginning…

As a young boy I used to watch lots of Kathakali and I had decided this would be my career. I suppose art ran in my genes. My grandfather was the late Kavalappara Narayanan Nair, though he had died before I was born. My uncle was Kalamandalam Rajagopalan, a Kathakali artiste who left the field early. My mother and her sisters were well-versed in classical music and dance. It was uncle who encouraged me. My father was a bank manager and he didn’t want me to be a Kathakali artiste. His priority was education, a degree and a respectable job. I believe his objection was because in those days he saw some artistes wasting away their lives with erratic and undisciplined lifestyles. He didn’t want his son to go that route. I still remember the day I came back home with my uncle from PSV Natyasangham Kottakkal. I recall watching him tell my mother: ‘Kottakkal will accept him. But his face is not very good.’ In my enthusiasm, I never paid attention to that. But that statement would come to haunt me years later.

How were your early days in the field?

I joined Kottakkal in 1979 when I was 12. My stage début was a year later as Krishna in Subhadraharanam. My gurus were the late Kottakkal Krishnankutty Nair, Kottakkal Chandrasekhara Warrier and Kottakkal Sambhu Embrandiri. Kathakali is not easy to learn. There is a reason why the kalari regimen is severe and involved physical punishment. Threats, fear and punishment are part for the course. Certain postures — for example lifting one foot with the sole looking up and the knee bent at a particular angle — don’t come naturally to anyone.

Where did the struggle and heartaches come from?

I finished the eight-year course and had two more years of further training. I was employed as artiste by PSV Natyasangham after the tenth year. But that was also the start of a traumatic phase. I had a job, but no work. I wasn’t found suitable for any big role because I was tall, gaunt and not handsome. I realised what my uncle meant years ago when he told my mother my “face is not very good”. I took out my frustration on the kalari. I continued to do cholliyattam practice sessions even after my peers stopped because I didn’t have anything else to do. It was also a release for my frustrations. I thrived on the punishing schedule. Every taunt and insult charged my batteries.

I used to go for programmes with the Kottakkal troupe but got only some bit roles. I may have done a hundred Sakunis in Duryodhanavadham. The roles that junior artistes grow up doing such as Krishna in Duryodhanavadham, Kuchelavritham or Rugminiswayamvaram or roles such as Dharmangada, Prahlada, Ghatotkacha and Utharan eluded me. I had practised all these roles in the kalari but never got a chance to do on stage till now. Those were depressing days. The therapy I badly needed came in the form of a pep talk from a connoisseur who found me crying alone.

What clicked on stage was my role as Brahmin in Rugmangadacharitham. I had a gift for comedy and I tapped that to win over the audience. I used to observe people and their mannerisms and sometimes would improvise on stage. People slowly started noticing me; they started asking for me.

Even today you are popular in comic roles such as Vriddha in Kuchelavritham and Mandhara in Ramayana.

They are legitimate Kathakali roles written and performed by our gurus. I never refuse a role but at the same time I ensure I perform only Kathakali without caricaturing it. The structure of Kathakali has been drilled into my body in 14 years of the kalari. I will never compromise on that.

But such portrayals would have been frowned upon by purists...

Of course. I have faced criticism at every turn, be it in a comic role or my focus on Thadi characters. But I have received more support than criticism, and endorsements from my gurus. The late vocalist Neelakantan Nambeesan told me about my Rugmangathacharitam Brahmanan. “This is the way to do it. This scene is a comical interlude before an emotionally charged scene.” That was a validation of my approach. Soon after I started doing Thadi roles, I visited my guru Krishnankutty Nair. He said he was happy I found a niche but cautioned me not to make it buffoonery. “Thadi roles are not second-rate ones. Stick to purity and clarity in kalasams and mudras. You can do it. When I first admitted you into Kottakkal I wasn’t sure where you would fit in. So I took extra care in training you for all the roles so that you would be an asset to any kalari”. That was again a confidence booster.

There is criticism about your lack of time management...

Kathakali was not meant to be measured in hours and minutes. In olden days, our asaans would present an inspired performance on a given day and no one complained about time. In such cases the second story of the night was cut short.

Another factor is the energy that we artistes receive from the audience. Kathakali is never performed in silence in a darkened hall. We see the audience, their reaction and get charged up. That too has a bearing on time.

Kathakali is an art form where seniority is considered sacrosanct. As society changes shouldn’t merit take precedence over seniority?

I believe seniority matters. Kathakali is not like a movie where someone graduating from an acting school can be given the lead role the next day. Kathakali is learnt and perfected in years of reiteration. Its strict syntax and idiom have to be instilled in one’s body. What is being presented is not just a story, but the story in the language of Kathakali. Respect and discipline are essential, on stage and in the green room. We don’t raise our voice in the green room. There are conventions to be followed. The mental preparation starts from the green room hours before you come on stage. Without this discipline you won’t last four hours on stage with such heavy costume and makeup. This discipline is what preserves Kathakali. It will be anarchy without this.

We see you performing more of heroic pacha and kathi roles these days. Is this a conscious shift?

I have never asked for a particular role. It’s either my employers or Kathakali organisers assigning me my roles. I know I am equipped to perform all roles. There is of course the question of preparing for a role. I read books, even translated works, to help me get a better grip on the characters and to gain new perspectives. Soon after I started doing Thadi characters, I had an offer to perform Jarasandhan. But I declined. I needed to do Sugreevan, Bali and Trigarthan several times before I attempted Jarasandhan. Finally I did that role 10 years after the initial offer. Similarly I have done pacha roles such as Nala and Bheema. But I am not ready to do Bahukan in Nalacharitam Fourth Day yet. I have some ideas but I need to develop them further. I will be ready soon.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/kh7ds8/article30682415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31TVFKOTTAKKALDEVADAS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/veteran-kathakali-artiste-kottakkal-devadas-recounts-his-journey/article30682420.ece
352,2020/01/29,Theatre artist Sanjna Kapoor receives French honour,"Thespian Sanjna Kapoor was awarded the French honour of Chevalier dans l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres’ (Knight of the Order of Arts and Letters) on Tuesday for her outstanding contribution to theatre.

Ms. Kapoor, who currently runs the Mumbai-based theatre company ‘Junoon’, was felicitated by Franck Riester, the French Minister of Culture, who was on a state visit to India.

“It is a great pleasure to be able to show France’s recognition of your outstanding artistic journey. A passionate woman of theatre, you completely throw yourself into making artistic productions accessible to the greatest number,” said the French Minister of Culture.

“Whether on stage, in front of the camera, or at the helm of the organization you run, you show the same infectious enthusiasm for championing the place of art in our societies,” added the minister.

Born to Bollywood star Shashi Kapoor and British actor Jennifer Kendal, Ms. Kapoor debuted as an actor in Aparna Sen’s 36 Chowringhee Lane in 1981.

She was also the leading lady in Hero Hiralal (1989), and appeared in Mira Nair’s Salaam Bombay (1988), but eventually went on to dedicate herself completely to theatre. She acted in numerous plays, and also took up the job of reviving Mumbai’s Prithvi Theatre, which was founded by her parents.

In 2012, she co-founded ‘Junoon’, an organisation that works towards increasing the reach of theatre and the arts to wider audiences through innovative initiatives.

The Order of Arts and Letters, instituted in 1957 by the French government, is conferred, regardless of nationality, on people who have distinguished themselves by their creativity in the fields of art or literature, or for their contribution to promoting the arts and literature in France and throughout the world.

353,2020/01/29,Farmers up against ESZ demarcation,"A joint action council of various farmer organisations in the State has decided to mobilise upland farmers to exert more pressure on the State Government to reconsider the implementation of the proposed eco-sensitive zones (ESZ) “which will displace hundreds of farmers in the Malabar region.”

Leaders of the council will meet Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan next week to convey their concerns.

According to the action council, the ESZ will have direct impact on farmers settled near the forest areas in Perambra, Chembanoda, Changaroth, Koorachundu, Kanthalad, Puthuppadi, and Kadavoor villages.

“There are mainly eight restrictions already fixed for implementation under the ESZ. Of this, the majority are acceptable to farmers as it aims at protecting their property from unwanted mining activities, quarry projects and industrial ventures. However, restrictions imposed on harvesting trees in farmland cannot be accepted,” said Joy Kannanchira, coordinator of the action council. He said there were even plans to incorporate the provisions of the Coastal Regulation Zone Act under ESZ to trouble the farmland holders in the area.

Mr. Joy claimed that farmers in Wayanad and Kannur districts too were on the war path. “If implemented, the ESZ rule can easily empower the authorities to demolish the farmers’ houses in such demarcated areas. Many villagers in northern Kerala are apprehensive of the move and the government should be ready to clarify its stance,” he demanded.

Farmer organisations including the Indian Farmers’ Movement (Infarm) and Rashtriya Kisan Maha Sangh have declared support to the action council. The organisations, now part of the joint action council, have made it clear that any move to extend the proposed zone to the farmlands will be challenged collectively.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/farmers-up-against-esz-demarcation/article30686982.ece
354,2020/01/29,Vegetable market to change face of Kalluthankadavu,"A slum spread over around two acres of land on the banks of the Conolly canal has been the identity of Kalluthankadavu in Kozhikode for decades until recently when it was demolished and the residents were shifted to an apartment complex nearby. The region is to get a whole new identity in around a year when the Kozhikode Corporation’s wholesale and retail vegetable market will be commissioned.

Mayor Thottathil Raveendran launched the piling works of the retail vegetable market on Monday, on the land where the slum was situated. Once completed, the vegetable market at Palayam will be shifted here. On the other hand, a modern commercial complex will come up at the site where the market is presently located. The project, being implemented by the Kalluthankadavu Area Development Company (KADCO), is expected to ease the traffic congestion at Palayam, which is caused mainly by the vehicles plying in and out the market and the bus stand.

The new market is being set up in 5.7 acres of land in three phases. The wholesale vegetable market building is nearing completion near the new apartment complex. The second phase is the retail fruit and vegetable market coming up near the canal, which is expected to be completed in a year. The third phase will be a commercial complex which will be constructed in a nearby land, the acquisition process of which is in progress.

K.C. Mujeeb Rahman, chairman of KADCO, said that the complex will have 37 cents entirely for lorry parking, besides dormitories for the out of State drivers to take rest. The retail market will have its primary entrance from the Kalluthankadavu- Puthiyapalam Road directly into its first floor. “It will have parking facility in all the floors and roof and will be able to accommodate around 250 cars,” he said.

The two-storied wholesale market, nearing completion, will have rooms for vegetable sale and cold storage. Lorries can be parked between the two blocks to load and unload stock.

KADCO will be in charge of the management of the complex for 35 years after which it will be handed over to the Corporation. Until then, the company can reap all benefits from the facility.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/vegetable-market-to-change-face-of-kalluthankadavu/article30685335.ece

357,2020/01/29,Street clean-up drive held,"The Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode (IIM-K) highlighted the importance of physical work through a Blue Collar street clean-up drive on Monday. The event was a prelude to the eleventh edition of the Calicut Half Marathon being organised by IIM-K on February 23. The event was also aimed at raising awareness about the ban on single-use plastic in the State.

A large number of environmental activists and students turned up to clean S.M. Street, the commercial hub of the city, early on Monday morning. Environmentalist T. Shobheendran, and Niravu Organic Village secretary Gireesh Pazhayathodi and coordinator Babu Parambath opened the event. Niravu, the NGO partner of the event, has been in charge of the upkeep of the street ever since its renovation two years ago.

The Calicut Half Marathon has been a success in all its previous editions, with participation of thousands including celebrities and commoners besides athletes. The marathon has been taking up a unique cause every year, such as United Kerala, women empowerment, rights of differently abled persons, waste management, organ donation and healthy living. The theme for the eleventh edition of the marathon is ‘Pursuit of Happiness – Healthy Body, Healthy Mind’ aimed at generating awareness about mental well-being along with physical fitness.The marathon is held in three categories — a 21-km half marathon, a 10-km mini marathon, which are competitive races, and a 3-km ‘Dream Run’, a non‐competitive run featuring people from all walks of life. The run starts from Kozhikode beach (in front of All India Radio office) at 6.30 a.m. on February 23.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/ef3kuz/article30678419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG6259,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/street-clean-up-drive-held/article30678420.ece
358,2020/01/29,Crafting a successful tale of tourism,"A tourism venture can claim to be really successful only when it improves the life of the people in its neighbourhood. There are no better examples in North Kerala to lend weight to this view than the Sargaalaya Arts and Crafts Village at Iringal, near Vadakara in Kozhikode.

Iringal is no longer what it used to be. A couple of decades ago, it was known for the huge rock on the banks of the Kuttiyadi river, near the Mooradu bridge. It is said that Kunhali Marakkar, the fabled naval captain of the Zamorins in the 16th century, used to watch out for foreign vessels in the sea, just two kilometres away, from atop the rock. And many a war against the Portuguese was said to have been fought here too.

The Iringal rock has long ceased to exist. It was razed down for granite in the 1990s. What remains of it are just stumps that stand like icebergs on an ocean, above the waters of the large pond, the absence of the rock has created. Call it irony or a historical U-turn when the art and craft village constructed around these stumps has become an excellent model of responsible tourism in the state. The village developed on 20 acres of land around what remains of the Iringal rock has become a matter of pride for Kerala Tourism.

Set up in 2010, Sargaalaya is now a hub of experiential tourism, where one can not only pick exquisitely crafted products but also experience the subtleties of crafting them. The village is among the first ventures based on the concept of Responsible Tourism in the State. The Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society can take credit for its management. Over the years, Sargaalaya has earned the National Tourism Award for the best rural tourism project in India, besides the South Asian travel awards twice.

To manage a village with 60 huts featuring craft products in a completely eco-friendly manner is no mean feat. Sargaalaya has a footfall of over four lakh a year. During the annual Sargaalaya International Arts and Crafts Festival in December-January, it sometimes witnesses a daily footfall of over 5,000.

The greatest achievement of Sargaalaya, however, is that the local people have accepted it wholeheartedly. They are beneficiaries of round-the-year jobs, skill training and monetary support when necessary. The unit sources all its requirements such as plantain leaf, vegetables, meat, fish and milk locally and thus enriches the local economy.

Sargaalaya is now the implementing agency of the ‘Rural Art Hub’ project of the Department of Culture, enriching the lives of artisans in 22 heritage villages in the State. The problems of each village have been identified and specific solutions have been found.

The way ahead for Sargaalaya, however, depends on the development of other tourism destinations in the region, for a tourist would not want to visit a region for just one attraction. There are many proposals: a tourism circuit project incorporating nearby Thikkodi beach, Kolavipalam mangrove forest, Lokanarkavu temple, Vatakara as a Kalari city, Thacholi Manikkoth, Velliyamkallu adventure trip and a river cruise.

While it awaits approval from the government for those proposals, Sargaalaya plans to add a few more internal attractions, such as light-and-sound shows based on the Vadakkanpattu, the story of Kunhali Marakkar and Theyyam. A terracotta museum is also in the pipeline. They are all welcome steps, no doubt.

If all these come up following the standards set by Sargaalaya, Vadakara could be a major tourism centre in North Kerala, hopefully without harming nature.

359,2020/01/29,No alternative yet for plastic pouches used in hotels,"Even while the Health wing of the Kozhikode Corporation is vehemently on the lookout for those violating the single-use plastic ban, there is a lack of clarity regarding the use of certain items such as thin polythene pouches used by hotels to pack gravies.

While the guidelines provided by the State termed polythene pouches as banned products, it contradicted itself in another part, said Health Officer R.S. Gopakumar, explaining why the hands of the inspection squads were tied to a certain extent when it came to hotels. “If we confiscate these pouches, we should be able to provide an alternative that serves the same purpose, which we are unable to do at the moment,” he said, adding that action would be taken against hotels for the use of such pouches as soon as an alternative was found.

While hotels and bakeries have largely resorted to the use of compostable plastic, pouches made of compostable plastic are no alternative for polythene ones. Compostable plastic is made of starch and does not hold liquids properly.

At present, the Corporation aims to check the use of non-woven bags and polythene carry bags besides disposable utensils. Five squads of the Corporation have been conducting regular inspections in large shops and supermarkets. So far, around 19,000 kg of banned products have been seized from various shops in the city.

Stickers that proclaim that the banned products are not available have been placed in front of most shops in the city. Meanwhile, various cloth bag manufacturing units under Kudumbashree have sold around 5,000 bags in the last one week and are busy manufacturing more.

“Alternative products like cloth and paper bags are readily available in the market. Several new players have come into the field,” said Dr. Gopakumar, adding that new agencies that market compostable plastic bags too had started functioning in the city.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/mbyzx0/article30678333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28KIPLASTIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/no-alternative-yet-for-plastic-pouches-used-in-hotels/article30678334.ece
360,2020/01/29,In the league of the extraordinary,"Actor Mamukkoya calls himself an ordinary person who had the good fortune to be among some extraordinary persons. On Tuesday evening, however, he was left wondering if he has now been elevated to a higher pedestal.

The veteran actor was delivering a speech after accepting Pushpasree Trust-Thikkodiyan Award instituted in memory of the well-known playwright and novelist from Kozhikode.

“I happened to go through the list of people who were earlier awarded. It includes eminent people such as poet O.N.V. Kurup and playwright G. Sankara Pillai. It is indeed an honour to be part of that group. More than anything, I think that is the biggest recognition I can think of,” said Mr. Mamukkoya. The actor also recalled his association with Thikkodiyan and how he was asked by the late actor Thikkurissi Sukumaran Nair to deliver one of his books to him.

Presenting the award, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran said Mr. Mamukkoya, known for his humorous roles, was the best choice for the honour as Thikkodiyan too was a practitioner of humour. P.V. Gangadharan, functionary of the trust, urged the Mayor to set up a suitable memorial for Thikkodiyan in Kozhikode city.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/jr1m5k/article30678319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28KI-MAMUKKOYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/in-the-league-of-the-extraordinary/article30678320.ece
361,2020/01/29,Meet the Gen Next 2020 designers,"There is only so much you can tell about a designer from their Instagram feed. But if they have a Lakme Gen Next tag, it is easier to make a decision — after all, a jury of buyers, editors and consultants review the collections and then choose the best of the lot. And since the programme’s inception in 2006, we did get introduced to the likes of Aneet Arora, Rahul Mishra, Nachiket Barve and Masaba Gupta.

It is also an opportunity for the designers to be mentored by industry experts and build an international network of contacts. The big prize is the runway show — their investment goes solely into creating the garments. (Under other categories like Emerging Designer, the slot fee can be upwards of ₹3 lakh, plus taxes.) But in its 29th edition, are they offering anything more? Long-time mentor Sabina Chopra says, “This season, we had a new selection process in place, which involved interviews and presentations by short-listed designers.” Earlier, applicants would send in their completed forms and some sample garments, based on which the jury would make their selection.

Chopra creates the mentorship programme based on “design, presentation, viability of the collections, business models, retail and giving an overall understanding of the fashion industry”. The four designers in this year’s edition concur that conversations around the economics of the industry — which is now very focussed on collaborations and retailing on social media platforms — was key to understanding their market. A multi-designer store tour was also arranged for the designers. “This gives them the chance to engage with retail owners, to secure real-time feedback as they prepare for a full-fledged launch,” she adds.

With these new aspects on board, the four Gen Next designers talk to Weekend about what to expect from them on February 12 at the show in Mumbai.

Repurposed surplus monofilament yarns used for embroidery

“As a young designer, it is impossible to say that you are 100% sustainable. But you also cannot ignore the climate change crisis, so it is imperative to do what you can,” says the Delhi-based designer. The 28-year-old worked with designers Manish Arora and Amit Aggarwal before launching his own label in June 2019. Nagpal was first introduced to monofilament yarn during his course at Central Saint Martin’s College of Art and Design. “While visiting fishing villages in Maharashtra, we came across these tangled yarns that couldn’t be used to make nets, and would be discarded in landfills. We dyed and used them to both embroider and create structured garments,” he explains. He will be showcasing both pret (₹10,000 to ₹35,000) and couture (upwards of ₹75,000).

Organic Kala cotton and woven fabric developed by the weavers of Bhujodi village in Bhuj

“Inspired by the distinctive style of embroidery done by the Jat community of Kutch, which is based on cross stitch, my debut at LFW embodies the cultural richness of India. These techniques on organic Kala cotton, sourced directly from weavers in Bhuj, are combined with European lace cutwork in order to create a global appeal. We’ve also used silk thread embroidery and cord work in geometric patterns for a boho-chic look, and woven fabric developed by the weavers of Bhujodi village in Bhuj for detailing, ” says the 28-year-old from Delhi. The NIFT graduate worked with the likes of Rohit Bal and Abu Jani-Sandeep Khosla before starting her eponymous womenswear label in 2019. “Going forward, we want to expand our footprint into multi-brand luxury stores with key focus being high fashion that is also wearable and commercial,” she says.

362,2020/01/29,‘Appoint SHRC Chairperson’,"An advocate moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday seeking a direction to the State government to take steps to appoint a Chairperson for the State Human Rights Commission.

The post was vacant since November last.

In his petition, advocate T. Thirumurugan from Ramanathapuram pointed out that the post of SHRC Chairperson was vacant since retired High Court Judge T. Meenakumari completed her tenure as Chairperson in November last.

With the vacancy not filled yet, hearing of cases concerning human rights violations had been affected. Even an acting Chairperson had not been appointed so far. This was unfair on the victims who hoped for justice. Without a Chairperson, only one-third of the cases were heard, the petitioner said.

Though a representation was sent to the State in this regard, no steps had been taken so far. Non-appointment of the Chairperson to the Commission was a clear violation of the Constitution. Therefore, the State must take immediate steps to appoint a Chairperson for the State Human Rights Commission, the petitioner said.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T.

Both parents and students were adversely affected by the extensive pressure to perform. Those from socially and economically backward groups were sure to drop out, he said in a statement here.

Even foreign countries discouraged the pattern of examinations as it was known to amplify performance pressure.

“The exams are a direct opposition to a child’s right to education and right to his life. The Union government seems to have imposed this decision on students without first talking to them. They have clearly not consulted teachers’ unions, psychologists and educationists,"" he said.

364,2020/01/29,Power play in setting up DPCs: ryots,"Heated arguments ensued at the farmers’ grievance meeting on Wednesday as agriculturists from across the district sought answers regarding the setting up of paddy procurement centres.

Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association president N. Palanisamy, who raised the issue, said there was extensive political influence in the selection of areas for setting up the procurement centres. Those in positions of power were disallowing the centres in areas where the yield was high and, instead, placing them where it was convenient to them. “The crops of farmers, who are unable to travel long distances, is getting destroyed,” he said.

Manigandan, another farmer from Natarpatti near Chellampatti, added that tonnes of paddy on farms were sitting idle post-harvest, leading to lesser price.

The remarks were followed by discussions and debates among farmers, who disagreed on whether or not it was right to make insinuations against politicians.

When the debates became confrontational in nature, Collector T. G. Vinay, who presided over the meeting, intervened and stated that 63 new procurement centres had been approved in the district. Their location would be reviewed and approved.

During a discussion on the need to strengthen the 58 canal scheme through Usilampatti, a farmer from the region alleged that the canal had cracks and holes at 27 places. Although PWD was well aware of the need to fix the canal, it had not initiated any steps to plug them.

A PWD official said that upon recommendation of Revenue Minister R.B. Udayakumar, they had completed a study on the needs of the canal and the bund would be strengthened.

Calling for the desilting of Vaigai dam, the farmers said it was essential to ensure that those who received water frsupply om the Periyar Main Canal and the Vaigai got their fair share.

The Collector said such an operation was large and would involve the coordination of various districts after getting the nod from the State government. A feasibility study was in place.

365,2020/01/29,HC hopes marriage will reform petitioner,"With a hope that marriage would reform a petitioner, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday granted bail to him, after taking cognisance of the fact that his marriage was scheduled for January 30.

After it was confirmed that the marriage was to take place as per schedule, Justice G.R. Swaminathan granted bail to K. Venkatesh of Kumbakonam in Thanjavur district. The petitioner was currently lodged in Kumbakonam sub jail after being accused for an offence under the Tamil Nadu Prohibition Act.

Hearing the petition filed by Venkatesh, the judge observed:

“I hope that marriage may reform the petitioner”. During the course of the hearing, the government advocate contacted the bride and confirmed that the marriage was scheduled for January 30.

With the petitioner lodged in the sub-jail, obviously prison was not an appropriate place to celebrate the marriage.

“Therefore, taking note of the humanitarian aspect, I grant bail to the petitioner,” the judge said and directed the Superintendent of the sub-jail to release the petitioner.

“I am conscious that under trials are not released after 6 p.m. But this being a special case, the jail authority is directed to release the petitioner on production of a certified copy of this order. Likewise, the petitioner may not have time to furnish sureties. Therefore, the petitioner is permitted to execute sureties on February 5,” the judge said.

366,2020/01/29,"A haven for job aspirants, researchers","At 10 a.m., job aspirants and scholars queue up at the entrance of World Tamil Sangam. As soon as they enter the library, they quickly settle down in the chairs with their study books.

The centre, which was built to augment Tamil research and learning, has caught the eye of students preparing for competitive examinations, thus ensuring thorough usage of the library.

P. Anbucheliyan, Director (in-charge), World Tamil Sangam, says there are a total of 20,000 books under various categories including world literature, English titles and research. However, much of the focus of Tamil scholars is centred on the wide variety of manuscripts on Tamil history, evolution of the language and story books.

“At least 250 students access the library each day. The process of indexing the books will be completed soon. We are also receiving copies of new publications in a number of languages, thanks to a government order,” he said.

Until a year ago, a large number of students looking for a quiet spot to prepare for competitive examinations made their way to places such as Corporation premises, Mahatma Gandhi Museum and District Central library.

When Gandhi Museum denied entry to them, they began to flockito World Tamil Sangam, says P. Prem, who has been visiting the library for about a year.

R. Sasidharan, another user, says the library, which has a concrete roof, is a far better option than open grounds.

“As a Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission aspirant, most questions I will have to answer are on Tamil scholars. The library offers me a variety of books on scholars while also providing me study material. I can also share best practices here with fellow students,” he points out.

R. Raghuram, who also plans to appear for TNPSC exam, says the atmosphere is conducive to study.

Other scholars use the books as reference material for their research, he adds.

Mr. Prem, however, feels that extension of library working hours may suit the needs of students who finish work and come to study. At present, the library is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Also, it will be useful if the area is accessible on Saturdays too.

A senior official says the hours can be extended when the proposed World Tamil Sangam library, a ₹6-crore project modelled on Anna Centenary Library in Chennai, is approved by the State government.

367,2020/01/29,Rapid rise in crimes against women and children in T.N.,"Data obtained through the Right To Information (RTI) Act between January 1, 2017 and September 30, 2019 by Evidence, a Madurai-based NGO, reveal that the number of crimes against women and children had rapidly increased in Tamil Nadu.

Talking to The Hindu here on Wednesday, Executive Director of Evidence A. Kathir said only 3% of the accused had been convicted in the State during the period – conviction rate in 2017 was 3.9%, in 2018 3.3% and in 2019 1.8%.

Evidence obtained data from 31 of the 32 districts (excluding Theni). A team from the NGO, which collated the data, said the police department’s non-cooperation and delaying tactics led to collection of only 60-65% of information. The officials in Theni district did not respond to the RTI application, he said.

According to figures gathered from police stations, 1,627 crimes against women and children were reported in the State in 2017, 2,069 crimes in 2018 and 1,855 in 2019 (January-Sept). The information should be a wake-up call to the government to pull up official machinery, particularly police, if it wanted to get a ‘peaceful State’ tag for Tamil Nadu.

Mr. Kathir said the number of cases filed by SC women and children and still pending with police officials was also high and it stressed the need to instruct police machinery to be impartial.

In 2017, the highest number of crimes against women and children was reported in Villupuram district (133), followed by Salem (118), Tirunelveli (115), Madurai (109) and Krishnagiri (82).

In 2018, Tirunelveli topped the list with 152 crimes, followed by Madurai (139), Villupuram (119), Salem (113) and Tiruvannamalai (110).

In 2019 (till September), Krishnagiri recorded the highest number of cases (124), followed by Tirunelveli (123), Madurai (117), Villupuram (97) and Vellore (96).

In the period, Krishnagiri district achieved conviction in 20 cases, followed by Madurai (3) and Coimbatore (1).

Mr. Kathir said only when the accused were punished within a time frame, as recommended by the Verma Commission, crimes against women and children, especially those from Scheduled Castes, would come down. The high pendency of cases in courts would only encourage the perpetrators.

He said the only commendable thing was that the State government had provided infrastructure and opened special courts/fast track courts to try the cases expeditiously.

Mr. Kathir demanded implementation of the Verma Commission’s recommendation to bar persons whose names figured in FIRs registered for crimes against women and children from contesting elections. Similarly, investigation officers, who failed to do their duty promptly, should be taken to task. He wanted the National Commission for Women to hold public hearings in all districts in all States to find out the status of disposal of complaints.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/rapid-rise-in-crimes-against-women-and-children-in-tn-madurai/article30686332.ece

V. Ganesan, the victim, was admitted to a private hospital after he sustained cut injuries on his head and limbs. Special teams had been formed to hunt for the accused, police said.

Ganesan fell unconscious and the gang members fled the scene thinking he was dead. They also hurled two lighted petrol-filled bottles on the shop.

Police suspect that a recent scuffle in Chinnakanmai during Pongal festivities could be the motive behind the attack.

On January 16, Ganesan and his family went to Shanmuga Nagar to offer prayers at a temple festival. A local youth riding a motorbike shouted at them, saying they were blocking the road. Ganesan’s nephew Bhoopathi retorted that they were standing only on the road margin.

Angered over this, the youth assaulted Bhoopathi following which a complaint was lodged with Teppakulam police. Police issued a community service register receipt and let him off with a warning. He was absconding.

369,2020/01/29,Isolation ward to treat potential cases of Coronavirus opened at Madurai GH,"Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) in Madurai on Wednesday, opened an eight-bed isolation ward to treat patients with Coronavirus, if any.

Dean J. Sangumani said that the creation of the ward was a precautionary measure and that there have not been any reported cases yet in Madurai.

They were identified as M. Muthukumar (27), B. Ayyappan (33), A. Anthonyraj (30), S. Sudalaimani (30) and N. Prabhu (29).

While Prabhu succumbed to head injuries after he was referred to Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, the others were killed on the spot.

The police said the accident took place at a curve on Tenkasi-Rajapalayam Road around 12.45 a.m. In the head-on collision, the front portion of the car was badly damaged and the body of Sudalaimani got stuck in the mangled remains.

Fire and Rescue Services personnel employed a wrecker van and an earthmover to retrieve the body from the car.

“We had to struggle for more than 30 minutes to pull the body out of the car,” said Rajapalayam Station Fire Officer S. Jeyaram. Following the accident, traffic on the busy section was disrupted for more than 30 minutes.

Initial probe suggested that the van, carrying some 17 persons, was driven rashly, Rajapalayam Deputy Superintendent of Police M. Nagasankar said.

Eight persons, including three women, travelling in the van were injured.

They were admitted to Rajapalayam Government Hospital.

371,2020/01/29,"State allotts 160 acres to Coast Guard to set up training academy in city, says Chief Secretary","The State government has allotted 160 acres to the Coast Guard in Kenjar village on the outskirts of the city for setting up its training academy, Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar said here on Wednesday.

Speaking at a function organised by the Coast Guard, Karnataka, to commission its high speed interceptor boat, which will be based in Mangaluru, the Chief Secretary said that it will become the national premier institute of the Coast Guard for training its personnel and later others.

The land has been allotted by the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB), he said.

The commissioning of the intercepter boat will help to strengthen the coastal security the Chief Secretary said, adding that the vessel will be used to check infiltration, prevent smuggling and illegal fishing.

The vessel, C-448, has been built by L&T Shipyard.

Navaneeth Krishnan, Senior General Manager of L&T Shipyard, said that L&T Shipyard had got orders for 36 interceptor boats for the Coast Guard. Subsequently, orders for another 18 boats was placed.

Terming it as a true testimony of the performance of the vessel, he said all 36 vessels of the first batch order have been delivered.

He said C-448 is the 12th vessel in the series of additional 18 boats. The remaining six vessels are in the various stages of trials.

It took 15 months from keel laying to the launch of C-448. During the trials, the vessel achieved a speed of 45.5 knots as against the required speed of 45 knots. It was delivered to Coast Guard about two months ago, he said.

Stating that the government has used these interceptor boats to build bridges of friendship with friendly countries, he said four of the interceptor boats have been gifted to various countries.

Of these boats, two have been gifted to Mozambique, one each to Seychelles and Maldives.

372,2020/01/29,"MP, MLA unhappy with functioning of hospital","Shobha Karandlaje, MP, and K. Raghupati Bhat, MLA, expressed their disappointment at the functioning of the Koosamma Shanbhu Shetty Memorial Haji Abdulla Government Mother and Child Hospital at the meeting of the District Development and Monitoring Committee here on Wednesday.

Ms. Karandlaje said that there were many complaints that the hospital, which was being run by BRS Ventures owned by the NRI businessman B.R. Shetty here, was avoiding admitting complicated cases.

“This was unacceptable. The Siddaramaiah government was wrong in handing over the land to BRS Ventures to construct the maternity hospital given the problems it is posing now. The demand of BRS Ventures to give permission to construct three floors below the ground floor for its private super-specialty hospital here was unacceptable as it violated the zoning of land rules and regulations,” she said.

Mr. Bhat claimed that the District Government Maternity Hospital was working well before it was given to the BRS Ventures under the PPP mode.

Delivery cases at the hospital were high because it was attracting cases from places outside the district such as Bhatkal and Bantwal. While the Koosamma Hospital was well maintained, it did not take complicated cases, he said.

Hence, a government unit should be set up at the Koosamma Hospital and a government medical superintendent should be appointed there. This would improve the functioning of the hospital.

The hospital staff had not let even the President of Zilla Panchayat Dinakar Babu get into the Kosamma Hospital recently and this was unacceptable, Mr. Bhat said.

The meeting decided that the low-floor government city buses should be made to run in areas where there were few private city buses. It was decided to call a meeting of Regional Transport Authority to decide on the routes and permits for the government city buses.

373,2020/01/29,Issues of highways dominate panel meeting in Udupi,"The issues of two national highways dominated the District Development and Monitoring Committee meeting, chaired by Shobha Karandlaje, MP, here on Wednesday.

Replying to queries by Ms. Karandlaje on the status of the construction of Malpe-Tirthahalli National Highway 169A, an officer, from the National Highways Division of the Public Works Department, said that land acquisition for 1km land at Parkala here was in its final stages and a gazette notification will be published soon. The work would start a month after the publication.

Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. had still not approved the design for the construction of a railway overbridge at Indrali here. If the approval was given, the construction of the overbridge could be taken up. The land acquisition for the stretch from Malpe to Karavali Junction here was yet to be taken up, he said.

Approval had been given for construction of a bridge at Perdoor. The Union Ministry of National Highways was yet to give its nod to the ₹200-crore package for constructing a concrete road on the Parkala-Shivapura stretch of NH 169A, he said.

Ms. Karandlaje directed Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha to resolve the land acquisition problem for widening the Malpe-Karavali Junction stretch of NH 169A here.

The fishermen had been demanding a four-lane highway as a lot of trucks carried fish from the Malpe harbour and also a lot of vehicles moved to the Malpe beach, she said.

Ms. Karandlaje expressed her dissatisfaction at the slow pace of construction of the flyover at Shastri Circle in Kundapur and the widening work of NH66 at Padubidri.

An officer for NH 66 informed the meeting that the construction of the flyover would be completed by the end of April and the construction of a bridge and service roads at Padubidri will be completed by March-end.

Ms. Karandlaje said that Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt. Ltd. had again extended its deadline for completing the works.

During a visit to the solid waste management site at Pachchanady, he said that solid waste management has emerged as a big challenge.

It is technically not feasible to manage the solid waste in the existing site at Pachchanady. Hence alternative sites should be explored. It could be abandoned stone quarry units even if they are away from the city, he said.

Sindhu B. Rupesh, Deputy Commissioner, told the Chief Secretary that about 8 tonnes of garbage slipped and entered dwelling places at Mandara last monsoon.

The families affected have been temporarily rehabilitated. An expert team has suggested the disposal of the garbage already dumped at Pachchanady through bio-mining.

Khader here on Tuesday.

Speaking with reporters, Mr. Khader said Mr. Singh had reiterated what Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said about the NRC. But, Home Minister Amit Shah has spoken in two Houses of Parliament about the government’s commitment to go ahead with the NRC exercise.

“There should be a clear statement by those who matter. Mr. Singh has not done this. There is still no clarity yet about the NRC exercise,” he said and added that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa should clearly say there will be no NRC exercise in the State.

Padma Shri awardee Harekala Hajabba, he said, does not have documents about his birth and has no information about his father’s birth. “Will you make such persons to stand in line for the NRC,” he sought to know.

378,2020/01/29,Protest over inability to cremate Dalits at Uchila Bada crematorium,"Leaders of the Dalit community made a pyre in front of the Gram Panchayat office at Uchila Bada village and protested against Dalits not being allowed to cremate their dead at a crematorium under litigation in the village near Padubidri in Udupi district on Tuesday.

They wanted the cremation of a former GP member to be held at the crematorium on Tuesday morning. Officers of the district administration finally managed to calm the protesters and the deceased was cremated near his house in the evening.

Former GP member

Mullagudde Shankar (70), a former GP member and father of Uchila Unit of Dalit Sangharsha Samiti (DSS) Dinakar, died on Tuesday morning.

The public crematorium at Uchila has been under litigation for nearly 12 years. DSS leaders and members of the Dalit community in the village insisted that the deceased should be cremated in the public crematorium under litigation. If not allowed, they threatened to do the cremation in front of the GP office and made a pyre there.

Mohammed Isaak, Kaup Tahsildar, and other officers, rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the protesters, who remained unrelenting.

Sundar Master, Chief Convener, DSS district unit, said that the only public Hindu crematorium in Uchila should be made available to members of all communities. But one particular community was not allowing the cremation of other communities there.

The development of 1.56 acre crematorium was taken up at a cost of ₹17 lakh in the village about 12 years back. But when the work was nearly 85% complete, the members of a particular community approached the court and got a stay order, he said.

After the stay order, the district administration became silent. Despite the stay order being in force, a road had been constructed in it. There was no other facility for cremating the dead in the village, Mr. Sundar said.

Mr. Isaak told the protesters that since the matter was in the court, the cremation could not be done there. The cremation of the deceased could be done in nearby Belapu or Kaup. But they remained unmoved.

Finally, Additional Deputy Commissioner Sadashiva Prabhu rushed to the spot and assured to look into the matter concerning the disputed land.

Ms. Prabhu, a student from Centre for Advanced Learning here, was among the 14 students who bagged the puraskar in the innovation category. President Ramnath Kovind gave away the puraskar on January 22 to 49 children in the arts and culture, bravery, innovation, scholastic, social service and sports categories. Apart from Ms. Prabhu, Pagun Pudukoli (art and culture) and Yash Aradhya S. (sports) were the other two from Karnataka to receive the award. Ms. Prabhu was conferred the award in recognition of her innovation in finding a mosquito-repellent cotton fabric. This research was among the 10 projects from India that featured at the international science fair in 2018.

Speaking to reporters at Mangaluru airport after her arrival from New Delhi on Tuesday, Ms. Prabhu said she was excited about her brief interaction with the President. “He patted my back and asked me what the meaning of Prabhu was. I replied that it meant God.” The President gave away a medal and a tablet to each awardee, she said. On January 24, all the awardees were invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to his house for a close interaction.

Her drive to create a cost-effective repellent for mosquito bites helped her develop the cloth. She had the help of her teachers at SDM School in Ujire. She used facilities of Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune. The fabric, she said, was effective against mosquitoes for 49 washes. She was now trying to develop a mosquito-repellent silk fabric.

381,2020/01/29,Forest issues dominateUdupi ZP meeting,"Issues relating to the Department of Forests dominated the general body meeting of the Udupi Zilla Panchayat here on Tuesday.

Raghupati Bhat, MLA, said that crusher operators were the worst affected in the district due to officials of the Forest Department always quoting rules and obstructing their functioning. It had recently been decided at a high-level meeting that a joint survey of forests would be carried out by officers of the Revenue, Mines and Geology and Forest departments in these areas and that concession would be given to partially deemed forest areas, he said.

A survey was conducted of the areas and 11 were found to be partially deemed forests. But it was not just the crushers, even other development activities such as construction of concrete roads or asphalting roads too had come to standstill as the Forest Department was objecting to them, he said.

Marali Pratap Hegde, member, said that if the Forest Department kept objecting to development works in rural areas, the problem of naxalism would once again raise its head in the district.

Rohith Kumar Shetty, member, said that as per the provisions of the K. Kasturirangan Report, areas in villages, including Ajri, Siddhapur and Ulloor, had been declared as eco-sensitive zones by the Wildlife Division.

This would affect farmers and development works in these areas. The eco-sensitive zones had been marked only through satellite survey and it did not reflect the ground reality, he said.

Lohith, Assistant Conservator of Forests, said that in some areas, the eco-sensitive zone ended at the border of a sanctuary as in the case of the Mookambika Wildlife Sanctuary in Kollur town. But in cases where it had not been decided, there would be a buffer zone of 10 km from the border of such sanctuaries, he said.

Mr. Bhat objected to the absence of the Deputy Conservator of Forest, Kamala, at the meeting despite advance notice given. Intervening, Preeti Gehlot, CEO of Zilla Panchayat, said that Ms. Kamala had deputed two Assistant Conservators of Forests to the meeting and she was in Dakshina Kannada as she was holding additional charge of that district.

It has selected Mannagudda ward to implement this initiative on a pilot basis in the city. As part of the proposal, acrylic laser engraved bar codes are now being displayed on the compound walls of houses and other establishments in the ward.

Solid waste collectors will have to scan this QR code using their mobile phones daily after collecting garbage. Then, whether garbage has been collected or not will be displayed in the integrated command and control centre (CCC) now being set up near the City Corporation office. Health officials of the corporation can also check the process.

If the pilot project becomes feasible, it can be extended to other wards, according to MSCL Managing Director Mohammed Nazir.

Speaking at a Meet-the-Press organised by the Union of Dakshina Kannada Working Journalists here on Tuesday, he said that MSCL has fixed enviro-sensors at five places in the city.

If there are any abnormalities in environment monitoring indicators, the CCC would receive a message from the sensors. Later, information would be passed on to the government departments concerned, including Karnataka State Pollution Control Board, for suitable action.

He said said that smart poles would be installed in 15 places in the city. Their devices would be linked to the CCC. Each pole would have a LED light, a Variable Message Sign (VMS) board, five CCTV cameras, emergency or SoS button and a public address system.

The VMS board will display information required, including the traffic situation. The CCTV cameras linked to CCC are used for surveillance purpose. This information is passed on to the police.

Using the SoS or emergency button, any person can speak to the staff at CCC where they can see those to whom they are talking to, for conveying urgent information in view of public interest.

Mr. Nazir said that the CCC would cost ₹ 74 crore. It will enable regular monitoring of public services and facilities through a unified system for governing public administration.

Export thrust

The unit will provide further impetus to SFL’s export thrust through addition of products to its portfolio as well as diversifying its export customer base, the company said.

Separately, the SFL board met on Wednesday to take stock of the results for the third quarter ended December 2019. The standalone net profit for the period dipped 7.59% to ₹103.06 crore on the back of a slowdown in the automobile industry.

Revenue from operations dropped to ₹692.80 crore from the ₹1,018.84 crore in the year-earlier period, while domestic sales were lower at ₹446.05 crore (₹608.48 crore) due to a drop in industry volumes.

Export sales for the quarter stood at ₹224.18 crore (₹370.67 crore), the company said in a statement.

Earnings before interest, depreciation and taxes (Ebitda) stood at ₹124.54 crore against ₹195.15 crore.

384,2020/01/29,Indigo shareholders reject change to share transfer norm,"In the latest round of the ongoing duel between IndiGo co-founders, Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal (RG), the former has emerged as the winner.

The airline’s shareholders on Wednesday voted overwhelmingly against a special resolution proposed by Mr. Gangwal which would deny his rival the right of first refusal in case of an equity sale.

In a BSE filing after the meeting, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd. (IGAL) informed the resolution was defeated as the votes cast against it were more than three times than those cast in favour.

Mr. Gangwal had sought deletion of clauses from the Articles of Association that provide the first right of refusal to the two co-promoters in case one of them seeks to transfer his share. According to experts on corporate law, the revision would have allowed Mr. Gangwal to sell his share in the company to either Rahul Bhatia’s competitor or anyone else without going to Mr. Bhatia first.

RG Group, comprising Mr. Gangwal, Shobha Gangwal and The Chinkerpoo Family Trust, collectively hold 37% shares in IGAL, while Mr. Bhatia’s company, InterGlobe Enterprises, owns a little more than 38%.

The investors were also miffed at Mr. Gangwal’s absence at the EGM, which he had called for. The spat between IndiGo’s two promoters became public last year when Mr. Gangwal wrote to markets regulator SEBI against his partner and the “unusual rights” to his group as well as alleged corporate misgovernance at IndiGo.

386,2020/01/29,Oil Ministry pitches for inclusion of natural gas in GST,"Ahead of the Union Budget, the Oil Ministry has made a renewed pitch for inclusion of natural gas in the ambit of GST to promote the use of the environment-friendly fuel by reducing multiplicity of taxes and improving business climate.

When the Goods and Services Tax (GST) was introduced on July 1, 2017, amalgamating 17 Central and State levies, five commodities namely crude oil, natural gas, petrol, diesel, and aviation turbine fuel (ATF) were kept out of its purview given the revenue dependence of State governments on this sector.

“Currently natural gas is taxed under the VAT regime with VAT ranging from 3% to 20% across States,” the Ministry said in a booklet it brought out to promote the use of the fuel in automobiles, household kitchens, and industries.

If brought under GST, natural gas will attract a uniform rate of tax at the consumption point anywhere in the country after doing away with current rates of excise duty and VAT.

This, it said, would “result in an increase in State domestic product and socio-economic development owing to increased economic activities” which will lead to improved employment opportunities.

Also, it would lead to improved investor confidence and attract more investment in natural gas infrastructure in the country, the booklet said, adding that a positive impact on environment and health due to reduction in carbon emissions across major cities was another advantage.

“As gas is not under the ambit of GST, there is no input tax credit available. Further, the downstream industries are not able to claim the benefit of the tax credit of VAT paid on purchases of natural gas which is available for alternate fuels/feedstocks,” the booklet said.

Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan too has been making a vehement pitch for the inclusion of gas in the GST.

“We believe natural gas as also aviation turbine fuel (ATF) can be included in the GST regime,” he had said on January 27.

Including ATF and natural gas will not just help companies set off tax that they paid on input but will also bring about uniformity in taxation on the fuels in the country, he had said. “Including natural gas in GST is said to be one of the biggest drivers of not just consumption but will also incentivize producers to spend more on finding and producing more gas as well as incentivize importers to bring in more LNG.”

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is scheduled to present the Union Budget for 2020-21 fiscal on February 1.

ATF makes up for almost a third of the cost of an airline and rates vary from State to State depending on local VAT.

A uniform GST would also push the usage of environment-friendly natural gas, whose share in the energy basket the government wants to increase to 15% by 2030 from current 6.2%.

Mr. Pradhan said the GST Council, the highest decision-making body of the new indirect tax regime, should take a decision in favour of these two fuels at the earliest.

The Council is headed by Union Finance Minister and comprises representatives of all States and Union Territories.

Under the existing structure, both natural gas and ATF attract the Centre’s excise duty and a State’s value-added tax (VAT). Both these and all other levies will get subsumed under GST if they are brought under its ambit.

The decision on their inclusion depends on the financial position of States as revenues from these five petroleum products constitute a substantial chunk of State government finances.

Barring a few, most of the States are incurring revenue shortfall as GST subsumed a dozen of their taxes, introducing the single levy, in a bid to simplify taxation system and remove the cascading effect of ‘tax on tax’ in the country.

According to the industry, keeping ATF and natural gas out of the GST net is increasing the cost of these products as tax on inputs is not being credited against the sale of these products, which ultimately, adds to the cost of production.

The Aviation Ministry has time and again sought inclusion of ATF under GST as any surge in international oil rates gets reflected in domestic jet fuel prices, leading to costlier air tickets.

Natural gas is widely used as industrial input by a variety of industries - from power to steel — and it coming under GST would help eliminate the cascading impact of taxes, bringing down prices of CNG and piped natural gas.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/7dvurc/article30684373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-GST-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/oil-ministry-pitches-for-inclusion-of-natural-gas-in-gst/article30684375.ece

391,2020/01/29,Examining the slowdown,"Setting aside the gloomy projections based on short-term economic trends, what does long-term and comparative evidence reveal about the health of the Indian economy? After the 1991 economic reforms, the Indian economy reached a higher growth plateau of 7% compared to a prior rate of 3.85%. India witnessed a high growth momentum during 2003-04 and 2010-11 with a period average of 8.45% (GDP with base 2004-05) or 7% (base 2011-12). The momentum lost steam in 2011-12 and 2012-13, gradually picked up again gradually to reach the 8% mark in 2015-16, and then started falling consistently to reach 6.63% in 2018-19. This trend suggests that India’s current growth challenge has a structural dimension as it began in 2011-12.

Despite these fluctuations from 2011-12, on average, India clocked a growth rate of 7.07% from 2011 to 2019, a decent figure compared to China’s and the world’s economic growth rates. Whereas, like India, the growth of the world economy was fluctuating since 2011, China’s growth declined consistently from 10.64% in 2010 to 6.60% in 2018.

Household investment

Why couldn’t India’s growth momentum be sustained after 2010-11? To answer this, an in-depth analysis of trends in five key macroeconomic variables — consumption, investment, savings, exports, and net foreign direct investment (NFDI) inflows — was done for two different periods: 2003-04 to 2010-11 and 2011-12 to 2018-19. The results reveal that compared to 2003-2011, investment and savings rates and exports-GDP ratio declined in the 2011-2019 period. The investment rate declined from 34.31% of GDP in 2011-12 to 29.30% in 2018-19, caused mainly by the household sector and to some extent by the public sector, but not the corporate sector. The slump in the domestic investment rate in the 2011-2019 period was compensated by increased NFDI inflows. On average, NFDI inflow was 1.31% of GDP during 2011-2019 compared to 0.89% during 2003-2011.

The decline in household sector investment justifies the package of measures introduced by the Central government to revive the housing sector. The questionable policy, however, is the steep cut in the corporate income tax rate from 30% to 22%, aimed at boosting private investment. Given that the corporate investment rate has not eroded severely during 2011-2019, one wonders if the tax cut would help economic revival. A part of the largesse offered to Corporate India could have been used to spur rural consumption.

Savings and consumption

The savings rate declined almost consistently from 34.27% of GDP to 30.51% between 2011 and 2018. This was also caused by a significant fall in the savings of the household sector in financial assets. Corporate savings did not fall. The fall in household financial savings is alarming and needs to be arrested. Savings are required to meet the requirements of those who want to borrow for their investment needs. Lower household savings imply lesser funds available in the domestic market for investment spending.

The decline in household savings has pushed up private final consumption expenditure consistently from 56.21% of GDP in 2011-12 to 59.39% in 2018-19. This suggests that economic growth during 2011-2019 was powered by consumption, not investment. In contrast, during 2003-2011, growth was powered by investments. Thus, the popular view that economic slowdown was caused due to a slowdown in consumption demand needs to be re-examined. There is no concrete evidence to suggest that the economy is facing a structural consumption slowdown.

India’s exports-GDP ratio declined from 24.54% to 19.74% during 2011-2019. The decline started from 2014-15, coinciding with a similar trend in the world export-GDP ratio. However, the drop in India’s exports was significantly larger than the world, a cause for concern. The exports- and NFDI-GDP ratio has deteriorated sharply and consistently in China after 2006. This, together with the consistent fall in China’s GDP growth after 2010, proves that the Indian economy is doing better than China.

392,2020/01/29,The many problems of delayed data,"In The Murder at the Vicarage, Agatha Christie wrote: “I often wonder why the whole world is so prone to generalise. Generalisations are seldom if ever true and are usually utterly inaccurate.”

It is appropriate to remember this statement when we discuss the crime scene in any part of the world. This is because crime statistics offer people a huge opportunity to indulge in generalisations. For instance, if there are two murders on successive days in our city, we are quick to condemn the police and the government for their alleged laxity in controlling murders. In India, ‘murder capital’ and ‘rape capital’ are some of the most regular expressions used by those who want to condemn the police and the government, and sensationalise crime, while ignoring the hard realities on the ground.

Law enforcement agencies have to learn to live with such sweeping remarks. To an extent, the anger directed at the state is rooted in partial crime data. But though accurate data may be difficult to come by, that gives us no reason to ignore what is available. If you want to portray the ground situation with reasonable accuracy, you need to rest your assessment on available statistics, however shaky they may be, and not make statements that betray your own prejudices and biases.

Publications such as ‘Crime in India’ (CII), which is brought out annually by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), offer some hope that at least some people, including researchers and discerning citizens, will give up sweeping analyses and rest their case on a rational platform. I do not for a moment suggest that NCRB statistics are 100% reliable. It is true that they have many infirmities. But the NCRB is the only source of crime data we have today.

Formidable challenges

Let us look at some of the formidable challenges faced by the NCRB. The first is the lackadaisical approach of some of the States in providing data. The NCRB merely assembles the figures it receives from the State police forces and does not tinker with them to reach a predetermined conclusion. It hits a roadblock when a few States either don’t bother to send the figures or send them much after the volume is published.

The second problem is that questions are raised over the utility of the data. There was a two-year delay in releasing the crime statistics for 2017. Just two months after it was published, the ‘Crime in India’ 2018 report was released. These numbers are only relevant to researchers, not policymakers. It is strange that we see such delays in an age of computerisation, when we boast of efficient and swift online services. Part of the blame rests on State police agencies. It is intriguing why they cannot send preliminary figures to the NCRB by mid-January every year and fine-tune the figures a few months later. A fossilised CII is meaningless. There is nothing sensational to report on what happened in 2018 on the crime front. A less than 2% increase in the total number of cases registered under major and minor laws may be comforting, but it does not carry us far in understanding what is happening on the ground.

The third problem lies with the police and the public. The police are notorious the world over for not registering complaints. They do this so that they can present a false picture of a decline in crime. This pernicious practice is often encouraged by the top leadership. Legend has it that some four or five decades ago, an Inspector General of Police in Uttar Pradesh lost his job for ordering his force to register every single complaint made to them at the police station! His political bosses apparently didn’t take kindly to this, as a phenomenal increase in the number of crimes would show the government in poor light.

The public are also not very enthusiastic about reporting crimes to the police. They are fearful of being harassed at the police station or do not believe that the police are capable of solving the crime. This is a Catch-22 situation.

Crimes difficult to bury

However, the problem has declined slightly over the years due to public awareness and intense media scrutiny. Despite the widely prevalent desire at the lower levels of the police, abetted sometimes by their immediate superiors, to suppress crime, there are a few classes of offences which are becoming increasingly difficult to bury. This is attributable to the extraordinary interest evinced by the media in reporting crime.

The first category of crimes that is difficult to bury is of homicides. India reports an average of 30,000 murders every year (29,017 were registered in 2018). Every murder is a matter of distress. Nevertheless the stabilisation of the figure at 30,000 is a mild assurance. The corresponding figure for the period in the U.S., a land notorious for lax gun laws and the liberal use of firearms to settle personal disputes, was around 16,200. Though the U.S. has about one-third of India’s population, the reported decline in murders in many major U.S cities is worth studying.

Crime against women should agitate every responsible citizen in the world. The common man in India does not lag behind others in reacting strongly to attacks on hapless women and men. The growth of the visual media possibly explains this welcome feature in Indian society. The nationwide outrage over the gang-rape of a woman in December 2012 in Delhi and the subsequent tightening of laws on sexual crimes generated the hope that attacks against women would decrease.

This prognosis has only been partially realised. In 2018, there were 33,356 rapes, a higher number than the previous year. But these figures do not fully reflect realities on the ground. There is still the unverifiable suspicion that while in urban areas sexual violence cases are reasonably well-reported, the story is different in rural India. Money power and caste oppression are believed to play a significant role in under-reporting. It looks as if we may have to live with this unfortunate situation for many years to come. What is more significant is that a substantial number of such crimes are committed by the ‘friends’ and families of victims.

To be fair to the NCRB, we must concede that the organisation has more than justified its existence. The CII is used extensively by researchers. However, there is scope for more dynamism on the NCRB’s part, especially in the area of educating the public on the realities of crime and its reporting. The NCRB will also have to be conscious of the expectation that it should bring greater pressure on States to make them stick to schedules and look upon this responsibility as a sacred national duty.

393,2020/01/29,Dissent won’t hurt a nation’s foreign policy agenda,"The ongoing protests against issues linked to citizenship are serious and the government has to find a way to reassure the protesters. But it is too much of a stretch to say that the demonstrations will hurt India’s foreign policy interests. The international order envisaged in the UN Charter is based on sovereignty, and interfering in the internal affairs of other nations is specifically prohibited.

During the Cold War, human rights issues were used selectively to discredit governments, but even apartheid South Africa was not isolated fully. Similarly, the Non-Aligned Movement was composed of several countries ruled by dictators who oppressed their people. India took pride in siding with them on the plea that internal policies had nothing to do with non-aligned solidarity and fight against imperialism and colonialism.

The only time New Delhi opposed a country from rejoining the Non-Aligned Movement on grounds of repression of its people was in 1991 when the Burmese military regime imprisoned Aung San Suu Kyi after she had won the elections. But the country quickly changed its stand, recognised the regime and began dealing with it to protect its national interests.

The politics of human rights

Even after the Cold War, countries were singled out for criticism on political grounds. While Cuba, for instance, was dragged over the coals citing human rights violations, China escaped action by resorting to gimmicks like ‘no action motions’.

India generally refrained from condemning individual nations for alleged violations of human rights and, at one stage, even declared that it will not support any resolution against individual countries if it was not a consensus resolution.

The U.S. agitated once, in 2003, about Libya becoming the chair of the Human Rights Commission and suggested that countries guilty of human rights violations should be expelled from such bodies. It even started a move to prescribe the criteria for membership of such organisations. But Washington found the outcome of the long negotiations so unsatisfactory that it had to vote against its own resolution. Recent protests in democracies like France have not resulted in Paris losing friends abroad. Similarly, no country has abandoned China on account of the unrest in Hong Kong. India has been silent during such protests and has continued its diplomatic engagement with these countries. If absence of internal dissent or existence of democratic institutions are considered the criteria for engagement, Russia and China will not be able to have any strategic partnership. During the golden era of Indo-Soviet relations, India had proclaimed that it was an ideal relationship between countries with different political systems.

Being open to criticism

On the other hand, strategic partnerships and cordial relations with other governments do not preclude criticism of a country’s internal developments. Reporting on the treatment of minorities in different countries is a task assigned to agencies like the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and these organisations carry out their work even when bilateral ties are at their best. In certain cases, U.S. Congress even moves resolutions to reduce aid to countries. The annual Burton Amendment in Congress was a sword of Damocles hanging over India during the Khalistan movement. India had to invest heavily in lobbying to defeat the Burton Amendment.

Further, even when controversial remarks, like those on religious freedom by President Barack Obama during his India visit in 2015, led to a bad taste in the mouth, India took such criticism in its stride and built bilateral relationship on the basis of mutuality of interests.

Independent nations take action on bilateral and multilateral ties on merits, even if decisions by other governments lead to internal protests. A country’s own Constitution is the only guide and the Supreme Court the prime arbiter on whether or not a particular action is constitutional. Such display of dissent cannot affect a country’s foreign policy as friends in the international sphere are chosen for the contribution they make for the common good or for bilateral benefits. Equally, the absence of protests in a diverse country like India does not guarantee a trouble-free relationship. The old dictum that the success of foreign policy depends on the capacity of the country to help or harm others and not on the absence of internal protests is still valid.

394,2020/01/29,Restructuring or bureaucratic overkill?,"The Railway Minister’s announcement, in December, in conveying the “historic decision” of the Union Cabinet to restructure the Railway Board, was like the proverbial curate’s egg, good in parts. The proposed changes at the Board level: re-designating the Chairman as Chairman and CEO, reducing the number of Railway Board members excluding the Chairman, from the existing eight to four and rationalising their responsibilities on functional lines and the induction of four members, from outside the Railway hierarchy in an advisory capacity are all, prima facie, unexceptionable. So also, the long overdue upgrading of 27 posts of General Managers to that of Secretary to the Government of India.

A single cadre

The same cannot be said of the breathtakingly audacious proposal to recruit officers/managers to a single service or cadre to be called Indian Railways Management Service (IRMS) for which the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) will conduct a separate competitive examination — also replacing the existing system of recruitment through the Civil Services Examinations and Engineering Services Examinations into the eight organised services within the Railways (excluding the Medical and Security Departments). A Committee of Secretaries will work out the modalities of implementing the proposal.

The ostensible reason for this “mega merger” is to counter “silo” mentality and inter-departmental rivalries that sometimes adversely impact the working of the Railways. It is unbelievable that this is the consensus solution that emerged after a two-day conclave with more than 1,200 senior managers, to combat departmental rivalries. If there is some method in this proposed “madness”, it is not apparent yet. Meanwhile, it is necessary to disabuse certain impressions created by the Minister’s media briefing and also flag a few troubling questions that the move raises.

The Minister’s assertion that Railway officers are constrained to function within departmental silos right through their service except at the level of the Chairman Railway Board is a bit of a stretch. A majority of Railway managers of all departments serve in one of the 68 operational Divisions of the Railways, particularly during the first 15 to 20 years of their service. So even at present the ethos of coordinated working and a broad exposure to departments other than one’s own is inherent in the system.

Further there are non-silo “general management” posts at various levels, meant specifically to provide interdepartmental coordination such as Additional Divisional Railway Manager, Divisional Railway Manager, Additional General Manager and General Manager, numbering in all about 175, to which officers who have been assessed to have the necessary competence and temperament are appointed. It is out of this cohort of officers that the future Railway Board Members, including the Chairman, emerge.

What is the nature of this beast called inter-departmental rivalry? It is not as though the officers of the various departments are constantly working at cross purposes. In that case the Railways could hardly function. On the contrary, a strong sense of camaraderie and mutual respect, in general, pervades day-to-day working among the various departments. Also departmental rivalry varies amongst departments over a wide range, from the relatively more prevalent, say between the Mechanical and Electrical Departments because of the nature of the functions performed and the turf they cover (which tend to overlap) to almost negligible say between service departments such as Personnel or Stores vis-à-vis other departments. There is also the temporary, situation-specific inter-departmental rivalry, say after a major Railway accident if the cause is not obvious. This usually involves three to four departments directly involved in train operation.

For a malady that significantly afflicts only a few departments is there a justification to overhaul the recruitment procedure, the results of which may become apparent only after more than 25- 30 years, when those recruited through the new scheme reach senior positions? What happens during the intervening period and how will the existing personnel be integrated into the new system?

More questions

The new recruitment procedure appears to target the wrong problem: that of disparity in promotional prospects between departments in a particular recruitment year. It needs emphasising that departmental rivalry is not a seniority problem but domain-related. A longer stint in a particular department or discipline is the basic requirement for developing domain expertise. Being humans not robots, this also generates a sense of allegiance, belonging, ownership, professional pride and loyalty to that department, which in turn could sometimes transform into ‘empire building’. These, and not seniority, are the predominant factors that influence a manager’s outlook or decisions, in the context of departmental rivalry.

The word “silo” usually has a negative connotation implying blinkered vision. The positive side of the same concept is “specialisation” or “domain expertise”. Incidentally, the Ministry has subsequently clarified that the UPSC will be conducting the examination keeping in view the requirements of managers for different services or engineering disciplines (departments). In which case, how does the new system differ from the existing one, except by way of a common recruitment examination?

Is the purpose of the new scheme to create a clone of the Indian Administrative Service within the Railways, with managers flitting across various departments every few years like rolling stones gathering no “inter-departmental rivalry moss” and no expertise either? Who will then man the posts in the Research Designs and Standards Organisation and in the training establishments or function as technical members in accident investigations or in high value tender committees? Is this the grand plan the Minister has in mind for preparing Indian Railway managers to meet the challenges of the future? Questions abound.

A single management cadre cannot make the functions performed by the different departments in the Railways to disappear. Some measure of departmental rivalry will always be there under the best of circumstances and in fact may even be beneficial as a means of “competitive tension”. It is the job of those charged with the coordinating function at various levels to ensure that departmental rivalry does not get out of hand. That it sometimes does is a reflection of the failure of leadership at that level. That is the issue that needs to be addressed. “Silolessness” carried to the extreme can only lead to apathy, neglect and chaos. It is wise to hasten slowly. As a first step, the merger between the Mechanical and Electrical disciplines, already proposed at the apex level, should be implemented down the line.

395,2020/01/29,Alarming spread: on novel coronavirus outbreak,"India is still novel coronavirus free, even as 18 countries/regions have reported 67 cases, as on January 28, according to WHO. As on Monday, all 20 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune were negative, according to a Health Ministry tweet on Tuesday. Besides the NIV, four other laboratories have been equipped for testing. Thermal screening of passengers from China will now be extended from seven to 20 airports; around 33,000 passengers have been screened so far. With Nepal reporting one case, another Health Ministry tweet says, “adequate preparedness for screening” is in place in five adjoining States. But it must be noted that in 2017, the Ministry kept under wraps the detection of three cases of the Zika virus in Gujarat. These came to light when WHO was informed in May that year, more than five months after the first case was laboratory-confirmed; the excuse was that the government wanted to avoid creating “panic”. Such irresponsible behaviour by China had led to the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus that claimed 774 lives globally in the early 2000s. India should under no circumstances repeat this with the novel coronavirus as much is not known about the virus.

In China, despite nearly 20 million people being locked down across Hubei province, the virus appears to be spreading with renewed vigour. Cases reported from mainland China have risen sharply — from 1,975 on January 25 to 2,744 on January 26 and 4,515 on January 27. Fatalities too have reflected a similar trend, touching 106 on January 27. The number of exported cases and countries that have such cases have also been increasing. The first case of human-to-human transmission was reported in Vietnam, and now Germany. The virus has long acquired the ability to spread among humans; WHO’s emergency committee meeting statement said China had reported fourth-generation cases within, and second-generation cases, outside Wuhan. Alarmingly, unlike SARS, more asymptomatic novel coronavirus cases are being reported. Besides a reported case in China, WHO has reported three other such instances outside that country. But China’s recent warning that the novel virus might be spreading even before there are symptoms has the potential to change the infection landscape if true. It is not clear if these were the reasons why, on Monday, WHO silently updated the global risk assessment from “moderate” to “high retroactively” from January 23. If the virus had exhibited all the attributes necessary to be declared as a “public health emergency of international concern” even during the first emergency committee meeting, the situation has become grim since then. WHO cannot dither any more.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/alarming-spread/article30677660.ece
396,2020/01/29,Maharaja on sale: on move to sell 100% stake in Air India,"Almost two years since the first attempt which failed to enthuse buyers, Air India is back on sale. Call it the government’s desperation to exit the troubled airline that is devouring tax-payer money or call it smart learning from the last failed attempt, but the terms this time are exceptionally favourable and clearly appear to be tailored based on feedback from prospective buyers. As per the document inviting Expression of Interest (EOI), the government will sell 100% equity in the national carrier and Air India Express Ltd. and its 50% holding in AISATS, the joint venture with SATS Ltd., Singapore; the debt that the buyer will assume has been whittled down to ₹23,286.50 crore to match the written down value of its assets; the net worth of prospective bidders is reduced to ₹3,500 crore and bidding consortium members can have as low a stake as 10% only. It almost appears as if the terms are designed with specific bidders in mind. But there is one catch. The government has not addressed a prime hurdle to the stake sale — the fate of 17,984 employees of Air India and Air India Express, 9,617 of whom are permanent. Of the three troublesome factors that put off bidders the last time round — the government’s insistence on holding a 24% stake in the airline post-privatisation, the large debt that it was expecting the buyer to assume and employee issues — the first two have been addressed but not the last one.

Apart from the huge employee base, the successful bidder will also have to deal with pension liability for the airline’s retired employees and their perks such as free/rebated tickets. All that the EOI document says is that contingent liabilities due to retired employees will be clarified at the Request for Proposal stage. If there is one weak spot on which the sale attempt could falter it is this. There is no escaping the fact that whoever buys the airline will have to shed surplus labour. A turnaround will not be possible without pruning employee costs. Maybe the government is hoping to negotiate with short-listed bidders on this sensitive issue that could have the airline’s unions up in arms. Yet, lack of upfront clarity on this may put off prospective bidders. The government ought to have gone the whole hog and clearly stated its intent. Maybe a moratorium for a specified period on forced attrition could have been spelt out. This would have helped bidders make up their minds. There has been criticism that a “nationalist” government is selling off the national airline. But such criticism has to take into account that precious taxpayer money has been washed down the drain trying to save the airline. A whopping ₹30,500 crore has been sunk into Air India since 2012 despite which it has been posting losses. The best way to save the airline, its jobs and the national exchequer is to sell it. And sell it on the best possible terms with minimum compromise on employee interests.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/maharaja-on-sale/article30677657.ece

398,2020/01/29,Train yourself to be an organic urban gardener,"You need not own farm land to grow watermelons. You can grow them organically on your terrace as well.

The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR) is not only demonstrating the methods of urban/terrace gardening at its national horticulture fair to be held from February 5 to 8 on its Hessarghatta campus, but also holding day-long scientific workshops on all the four days on urban gardening concepts.

Principal Scientist and head of IIHR’s Division of Floriculture and Medicinal Plants, Dr. Ashwath, who is the co-ordinator for the course, told The Hindu that it would focus on helping urban residents grow their own vegetables and a few flowering plants on their terrace spaces in an organic manner. The main intention is to ensure availability of fresh and safe vegetables on a daily basis through proper utilisation of space, he explained.

“It is a comprehensive course, where we try to educate the participants on all important aspects of urban/terrace gardening including selection of varieties based on the season, medium of cultivation, cultivation practices, identification of pests and diseases, organic pesticides and plant management,” he said.

It would also train participants on turning their wet waste into composte so that they would be self-reliant in terms of manure.

The participants will be given a pen drive containing a chart on season-based cultivation of vegetables and various information related to urban horticulture. The workshop will cost ₹1,500 per person, including food.

The participants would be introduced to the concept of soil-less cultivation such as hydrophonics and aquaphonics and vertical gardening. Apart from giving information about the places where grow-bags and cocopeat is available, the IIHR is also thinking of ensuring availability of five-kg packs of cocopeat for sale on the occasion.

Seeds for some of high value vegetables would also be available for sale, Dr. Ashwath said. Efforts would also be made to create awareness about the use of shadenets in terrace gardening to protect the plants and to increase yield levels, he said.

The fair would showcase about 20 herbs and medicinal plants that could serve as house remedies, he noted. The IIHR has created a separate pavilion for urban gardening in which about 58 varieties from 26 crops have been demonstrated. The varieties, cultivated in grow-bags, include drumsticks (for leaves), water melon, tomato, brinjal, chilli, capsicum, beans, peas, onions and ridge guard.

Details regarding the workshop may be had from Dr. C. Ashwath, Ph-9902522229 or email:sphiihr2005@gmail.com.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/train-yourself-to-be-an-organic-urban-gardener/article30686660.ece
399,2020/01/29,"Inspired by crime show, youth kidnaps minor","The Cottonpet police caught a 21-year-old youth who, inspired by a crime show on TV, allegedly kidnapped a minor boy for ransom on Tuesday afternoon. Based on a complaint by Heeraram Patel, the boy’s father who owns an electronic goods store in Cottonpet, the police tracked down the accused, Chirag R. Mehta, to a hotel on Lavelle Road.

According to the police, after the boy failed to come home from school, his father decided to go to the police. On the way, he received a call from a man who claimed to have kidnapped his son and demanded ₹5 lakh for his safe release. Patel shared the mobile number of the caller with the police.

A team led by Inspector T.C. Venkatesh was able to track down Chirag to a hotel on Lavelle Road. “He had used the phone of a passer-by to make the ransom call and had hired a scooter to kidnap the boy,” said a police officer.

When the police team reached the hotel, the found the boy unharmed in a room. “He was not aware of the incident and was enjoying bhel puri that the accused had got him. The boy told the police that he knew Chirag as he frequently visited his father’s shop,” said the police.

On Tuesday, Chirag met him outside the school. “The boy thought Chirag had come to pick him up. Chirag promised to take him for a ride and buy him snacks before dropping him home,” said the police.

Chirag claimed that he was in dire need of money and decided to kidnap the boy as he knew that his family is well-off. He claimed to have been inspired by a crime show.

400,2020/01/29,Know tubers and roots other than potatoes?,"What are the roots and tubers you use in your diet? The list often stops at potatoes, carrots and beets. But here is a chance to see, buy and learn how to include nearly 200 tubers into your diet.

The city will host a ‘Roots and Tuber Festival’ from January 31 to February 2, organised by Sahaja Organics, at Greenpath, an organic restaurant and store in Malleswaram. Jenu Kuruba, Soliga and Irula tribes will be participating in the festival with their large and diverse tuber collection. More than 10 groups will bring over 200 different kind of tubers for display and sale.

The focus of this festival would be to sensitise the urban community on the benefits of tuber consumption and explore value addition, and include them in our diets. “As the potato eclipsed all its other cousins, particularly in cities, the consumption of tubers got restricted to tribes. It’s time we move beyond the potato, which is vulnerable to pests and disease, and also requires more investment and attention. This festival will help the youth to know about the different types of roots and tubers,” said Krishna Prasad, Director, Sahaja Organics.

Tubers have the potential to overcome adverse soil and weather conditions, global warming and climate change, he said. Conservation of tubers is required to realise their potential for a hunger-free world, he added. “Tubers represent a symbiotic association of forests and human cultures, but this is at the crossroads as forests are on the decline. Many local communities preserve various varieties even to this day. They display a remarkable knowledge of the edible tubers that they gather or grow,” a brochure of the festival said.

The festival will not only be an exhibition-cum-sale of tubers and roots, but will also help consumers with recipes to include tubers in the diet. Food blogger Shri Kripa Uppangala will host a training programme ‘Cooking with Tubers’ and well-known chef Pradeep Anand will share a variety of offerings made using tubers covering a wide variety of regional traditional cuisines on Saturday.

A cooking contest has been organised on Sunday where participants may prepare food using roots and tubers in their houses and bring them to the venue. Special preference will be given to food prepared with tubers other than potato.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/know-tubers-and-roots-other-than-potatoes/article30686494.ece
401,2020/01/29,Revenue mobilisation a priority: BBMP chief,"Though the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has set itself a target of Rs.3,000 crore for property tax collection, civic Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said there was room to increase the revenue source.

The property tax system needs to be revamped as there are issues with regard to khata registration, khata transfer, he said, adding that a white paper on this has been prepared.

“Many changes should have been brought in place. However, since 2006, some systems that were in dire need of revamp have not been revised. Making changes now is inevitable, and it may well include rate revision, zonal reclassification,” he said.

One of the problems is the fact that many property owners are guilty of under-declaring and paying less tax to the BBMP under the current Self Assessment Scheme. The Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, allows scrutiny of 10% of the properties. This, the commissioner maintained, may not be enough and needed to be increased. “To discuss these issues, we can either constitute a committee comprising senior councillors and former mayors, or call a special council meeting,” he suggested.

Reforms in waste management

On solid waste management, Mr. Anil Kumar said the civic body is trying to bring in reforms. “We are presently implementing the Indore model on a pilot basis in four wards in the city, and are seeing some good results. We can hold a special council to discuss the pilot and take a call on extending the same to other wards,” he said.

‘No role in Bellandur demolition’

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar reiterated that the civic body had no role in the demolition of hutments in Bellandur when the matter came up for discussion in the council on Wednesday. He said none of the BBMP officials were at the spot when the demolition was taken up.

“The local AEE had written to the police. However, the letter did not mention any date for the demolition. Even the AEE was not present when the demolition was taken up,” he said and added that the same had been mentioned in the affidavit submitted to the High Court of Karnataka.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/revenue-mobilisation-a-priority-bbmp-chief/article30686366.ece
402,2020/01/29,Land Transport Cess approval: Mayor says he made a mistake,"Mayor M. Goutham Kumar was left red in the face on Wednesday after he acknowledged that the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) council had deferred its decision to levy Land Transport Cess. This comes a day after he announced that the council had approved the cess and was hoping to collect ₹150 crore towards the improvement of Bengaluru’s roads.

Soon after the monthly meeting began, several councillors from the Opposition Congress, including party leader Abdul Wajid, stormed the well. They pointed out that levying the Land Transport Cess would burden citizens. When they cited media statements that the Mayor had given on Tuesday, Mr. Goutham Kumar admitted that he had ‘made a mistake’ by assuming that the subject had been approved.

Tipu Circle

The Opposition councillors also sought clarity on the council revoking the earlier resolution of renaming Bellahalli Circle as Tipu Circle, and asked under what provisions of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, was this done.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said he would go through the files and take legal opinion.

LED lights

Several councillors sought to know the status of the project to convert the city’s 4.8 lakh streetlights into LEDs, which should have been well under way by now. They pointed out that a delay in the project, coupled with the fact that they are not allowed to undertake repair work themselves, is exacerbating the problem of lighting in many neighbourhoods.

Mr. Anil Kumar said he had recently met the agency that won the global tender and warned them against any further delay. “If the agency delays further, the work order will be cancelled,” he said and added that he was approving proposals under the 14th Finance Commission for installation of LED lights.

Later, the council passed a resolution to hand over works to be taken with funds from the 14th Finance Commission to the Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Ltd. (KRIDL).",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/8g2n1c/article30685566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGBBMPCOUNCILPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/land-transport-cess-approval-mayor-says-he-made-a-mistake/article30685567.ece

Muniyanna, 50, and Siddappa, 19, had been engaged by SSBS Jain Sangh Trust for the cleaning work. When Siddappa entered the pit, he soon stopped communicating with others. Worried, Muniyanna went down the pit to rescue him, but fell unconscious. They were rescued and rushed to the nearby Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital.

While Siddappa was declared brought dead, Muniyanna was being treated in an Intensive Care Unit, where he succumbed on Wednesday.

A team led by National Commission for Safai Karamcharis member Jagadish Hiremani and officials of Social Welfare Department visited the trust office and the hospital.

When confronted by social activists on the delay in action against the accused, the team members assured them that they had instructed the police to track down the absconding accused within two days.

405,2020/01/29,BBMP council okays move to collect Land Transport Cess,"If the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) gets its away, property owners will see an increase in the coming 2020-21 financial year. The civic body on Tuesday, approved a proposal to collect Land Transport cess, which will be 2% of the total property tax. Though the proposal has been approved by the BJP-majority council, it still has to be ratified by the State government.

Incidentally, when the the Congress-Janata Dal (S) combine brought up the collection of Land Transport cess in 2018 and 2019, the BJP, which was in the Opposition at the time, had vehemently argued against it on the grounds that it would burden citizens.

The BBMP already collects four cesses – Beggary, Labour, Library and Solid Waste Management – along with property tax.

Stating that an estimated ₹150 crore can be collected as Land Transport cess, Bengaluru Mayor M. Goutham Kumar said the maintenance of city roads was the responsibility of the BBMP. “We will urge the government to allow the BBMP to utilise the cess amount collected as part of the property tax,” he said.

Opposition Leader Abdul Wajid took objection to the resolution passed and pointed out that the BJP, which had earlier opposed the proposal, had now approved the same.

BWSSB board recommends tariff hike

The Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewarage Board, which met on Monday, has recommended a tariff hike. “We have discussed three scenarios: to fix tariff for BWSSB to recover its operational expenditure, to recover its operational and essential expenditure and to recover all expenses including to pay back loans. We have recommended the second scenario to the State government,” said Tushar Girinath, chairperson, BWSSB. He refused to quantify the effective hike in tariff due to this and said it was up to the state government to take a call on the issue.

Bellahalli Circle will not be renamed Tipu Circle

The BBMP council passed a resolution to revoke the decision on renaming Bellahalli Circle as Tipu Circle. Last year, the council had decided to rename it after Tipu Sultan, but has now decided against it.

Mr. Kumar defended the resolution and stated that the civic body had received objections from local communities after the name was changed.

The council also approved a resolution to establish a KAS/ IAS training centre for students belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. The training centre, which will provide training free of cost, will be set up at a cost of ₹5 crore.

It has also approved the acquisition of additional mechanised sweeping machines to clean the city roads.

One day salary cut

Upset with lack of attendance and participation of BBMP staff during the Republic Day celebrations held in the civic body's headquarters on Sunday, city Mayor M. Goutham Kumar has recommended that a day’s salary be cut from all those who were absent. “We get two chances to show respect to our nation and National Flag – Republic Day and Independence Day. It is our duty to show respect on these two days,” said the mayor.

KSCA fine

The BBMP has warned the Karnataka State Cricket Association that it will take action under the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, and close down Chinnaswamy stadium, if the association does not pay the fine within two days. The BBMP had levied a fine of ₹50,000 on the association after finding that banned plastic items were being used during the one-day international match between India and Australia on January 19. However, the association is yet to pay the penalty.

410,2020/01/29,"Coronavirus: self-declaration forms in aircrafts, separate immigration counters at Chennai airport","Travellers from China or any of the countries affected by the novel coronavirus are now being asked to fill self-declaration forms before disembarkation at the Chennai airport. At the airport, 10 separate immigration desks have been set up for travellers with symptoms, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said.

On Wednesday, Dr. Rajesh held a meeting with stakeholders, including officials of the customs, immigration, airport manager, regional disease surveillance programme officials, Port Trust officials and airport doctors at the Chennai airport. She inspected the measures in place to screen passengers from the affected countries.

“All airlines have been instructed to make an announcement before asking passengers to disembark from the flight to fill self-declaration forms. Travellers from China or any of the seven countries where persons have tested positive for coronavirus will have to fill the forms giving their names, address and contact numbers, and if they have the three symptoms of fever, cough and breathing difficulty,” she said.

If any of the passengers have symptoms, a protocol has been put in place where airport doctors would screen them in a separate examination room. They will be advised home quarantine and monitored for 28 days, she added.

“Already, three separate immigration counters have been set up for travellers with symptoms. With cases being reported in an increasing number of countries, seven more separate immigration desks have been set up for these passengers. The required personal protection equipment is available for doctors and paramedical personnel,” she said.

A dedicated ambulance has been deployed at the airport to shift passengers with symptoms to the isolation ward at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, if required.

Sample testing

Being a new strain of the coronavirus, the Health Secretary said samples would be sent for testing to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. “We also have dedicated courier services to carry the samples for confirmatory tests in Pune,” Dr. Rajesh said.

While thermal screening is in place at the Chennai airport, it will be launched at Tiruchi airport on Wednesday, while symptomatic screening was being done at the Coimbatore and Madurai airports. Signages were put up at the airports asking travellers from China to approach desks for health screening.

There are no positive cases of coronavirus in Tamil Nadu, she said. “The transmission of coronavirus is 20% air borne, and 80% by touching contaminated surfaces. So, we have asked the airports to clean the surfaces regularly. Wall-mounted hand rubs are available in the airport,” she said.

She added that a mock drill would be conducted to check for the flow of arrangements if a person with symptoms has to be shifted from the airport to the isolation ward in the ambulance.

“We have also alerted the seaport authorities to take up screening,” she said.

Dr. Rajesh urged members of the public to wash their hands regularly and to cover their mouths and noses while coughing or sneezing. Avoid contact with animals and consume well-cooked non vegetarian dishes, she added.

Officials of the Health Department including K. Kolandaswamy, director of public health, was present at the meeting.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kcqf6j/article30683427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29JANTH-AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/coronavirus-self-declaration-forms-in-aircrafts-separate-immigration-counters-at-chennai-airport/article30683428.ece
411,2020/01/29,Over 6 crore people have travelled through Chennai Metro since 2015,"Ever wondered how many people have travelled on the Chennai Metro ever since the first service in 2015? A total of 6.08 crore in the last four years, with a steady increase each year.

From June 2015 to December 2015, when Chennai Metro Rail began the 10 km stretch of Koyambedu to Alandur, it had only 26.3 lakh passengers. In February 2019 alone, when the entire 45 km of phase I project was up and running, the ridership grew to 23.6 lakh.

Interestingly, the ridership for the years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 together was 2.80 crore, whereas the year 2019 alone witnessed Chennai Metro Rail carrying 3.2 crore passengers. From the beginning of the year to the end, the ridership has seen a spike of 45 percent.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), one of the major reasons for the consistent increase in the number of people travelling could be the availability of last mile connectivity options like share cars and and share autorickshaws in several stations; but there are still quite a few stations where this facility has not been brought in.

“Monday and Friday, we see a sharp increase of nearly 4,000-5,000 more than other days, as many who travel to other cities or districts use the metro to reach CMBT, Chennai airport, Chennai Central or Egmore. Also, after we announced a 50 percent discount on Sundays and public holidays, the patronage has improved quite a bit; from about 60,000-70,000 earlier, we get nearly 90,000 now,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pi69dm/article30682886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29JANTH--PASSENGERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/over-6-crore-people-have-travelled-through-chennai-metro-since-2015/article30682887.ece
412,2020/01/29,Minister M. C. Sampath reviews Chennai Metro’s progress,"Minister for Industries M.C. Sampath reviewed the progress of the phase I extension project and phase II project of Chennai Metro Rail in Koyambedu here on Tuesday.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Sampath said, “I have asked Chennai Metro Rail Limited to speed up the phase I extension project, so that it can be opened in five months. It will be very beneficial for the people of north Chennai.”

According to CMRL officials, the Minister wanted to know how far the phase I extension project that connects Washermanpet with Wimco Nagar, had been completed.

This project is currently underway, and various works including construction of stations and tracks, and installation of systems have been going on for several months now. CMRL plans to make this 9 km stretch linking north Chennai operational by June this year.

The Minister also asked about the progress of the phase II project that has been planned to cover 118.9 km in the city. Initially 52 km will be constructed, and officials briefed the Minister about this.

Officials said they also informed the Minister about the patronage of the phase I project spanning a 45 km network that is functional now. “He was keen to know about the last mile connectivity and the ways in which the ridership of the system can be further improved henceforth. We told him of the steps we have been taking these last several months to boost the number of people travelling and the facilities we have provided,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vu5jj/article30682001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29JANTH--IndustriesMinjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/minister-m-c-sampath-reviews-chennai-metros-progress/article30682002.ece
413,2020/01/29,Anna University leather technology students launch resource for start-ups,"Students from the department of leather technology in Anna University, have floated a new initiative called ‘Front line leaders and young entrepreneurs’ resource for start-ups in leather’, or Flyers.

The idea behind this initiative is to seed, nurture and foster the start-up culture among students, said Joe Arun J., who spearheads this initiative, speaking at the 53rd Leather Research Industry get-together, LERIG 2020, organised by CSIR - Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI) in association with the stakeholders of the Indian leather industry. In the long term, the game plan is to have linkages with start-up promotional centres in the region.

Former ISRO Chairman, K. Kasthurirangan, who inaugurated LERIG 2020, said, “Visionaries of India chose to locate CLRI at the then Madras when the Madras Port was India’s window to the leather world with more than 85% of exports being made through the city.”

He further said that while the leather sector has created a vast number of jobs particularly for women, it is necessary to increase the value of employment in the sector.

M.K. Surappa, Vice Chancellor of Anna University, suggested that students pick up best practices and ideas from others sectors like textiles and implement them in the leather sector.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/anna-university-leather-technology-students-launch-resource-for-start-ups/article30681931.ece
414,2020/01/29,"Ramadoss wants ₹1,000 crore more for T.N. under MGNREGA","PMK founder S. Ramadoss has demanded that the Central government provide more funds for the employment scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). In particular, he has sought an additional ₹1,000 crore for Tamil Nadu.

In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss referred to The Hindu report ‘Fund crunch hits MGNREGA scheme’, which pointed out that more than 96% of the allocated money had already been spent or was needed to clear dues, and less than ₹2,500 crore was available to sustain the scheme for February and March. Referring to Tamil Nadu’s position, Dr. Ramadoss said the State had a deficit to the tune of ₹300 crore.

“Apart from Tamil Nadu, that the situation was prevalent across India was anticipated earlier. This is due to the fact that the allocation made for the scheme for the current year was only ₹60,000 crore, compared to ₹61,084 crore in 2018-19. This [year’s] allocation should have been at least 10% more than last year’s allocation,” he said. Dr. Ramadoss said the Centre had allocated ₹4,686.87 crore to Tamil Nadu this year, while the State had provided ₹4,977.45 crore. The funds had already been spent this year, he said. He further said there were a total of 6.91 lakh projects planned under the MGNREGS in the State, of which 3.16 lakh had been completed. “As regards the remaining 3.74 lakh projects, more than half of the planned projects are under implementation. If all the projects are not completed this financial year itself, it will affect rural development and the economy badly and will prevent the growth of the State,” the PMK leader said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pu6mpz/article30681290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29SRAMADOSSVELLORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ramadoss-wants-1000-crore-more-for-tn-under-mgnrega/article30681291.ece
415,2020/01/29,Chennai residents rush to get birth certificates after January 1,"On Tuesday, M. Khan, 84, spent a lot of time on the premises of Ripon Buildings, going from official to official enquiring about the procedure for obtaining a birth certificate.

His passport shows his place of birth as Chennai. He speaks his parents’ language of Tamil, explaining to officials about his birth in Chennai in 1935, employment with a public sector bank and the death of his wife. He has records of his employment with the bank, ration card and Aadhaar.

But all these documents he carries do not count for the issuance of a birth certificate, according to existing statutory provisions.

He had to leave Ripon Buildings after a long day in search of land records of his ancestral home, which was sold to a builder for redevelopment.

He says he was worried about getting a birth certificate to prove his citizenship because of the recent amendments made by the government.

According to Corporation records, the number of residents visiting the office for birth certificates has increased nearly seven times after January 1.

“Every day, we used to receive 10 to 20 applications. The number has increased to 70 after January 1. Those seeking birth certificates belong to all religions,” said an official.

Going only by the names of the applicants for birth certificates in Chennai in January, 80% of the applicants are Muslims. The number of applications for birth certificates started gradually increasing after the announcement of Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens and the data shows a sudden rise in January 2020.

More than 60% of the city residents, who were born before 1990, do not have a birth certificate, it is estimated. The number of city residents without a certificate is expected to be over a million. “Most of the residents applying for birth certificate are elderly people. It is a worrying trend,” said an official.

Chennai Corporation officials said the birth certificate of such residents would be issued based on a “field enquiry” by the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO). The Corporation issues a non-availability certificate and the RDO has the powers to pass orders on the citizens’ place of birth. But the procedure takes three months. The process of verification also involves field verification by Revenue Inspectors of the District Administration, Sanitary Inspectors of the Corporation and the local police. With inadequate manpower in the Chennai District Administration, the process of issuance of birth certificate for all such residents may even take many years.

As most of the buildings that existed in 1935 in the city are already razed, it is not possible for the police to verify the place of birth, making the process more challenging, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/article19386218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-BIRTH%20CERTIFICATE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-residents-rush-to-get-birth-certificates-after-january-1/article30679265.ece

418,2020/01/29,‘₹18 lakh missing from Paranur toll plaza after Sunday’s violence’,"A complaint has been filed with the police alleging that ₹18 lakh was stolen from the toll plaza at Paranur, Chengalpattu, during the violence that took place in the early hours of Sunday.

The toll staff had asked the bus crew to pay the user fee since the vehicle had entered the cash-only lane. Since the crew did not pay, an altercation ensued leading to assault.

Irate passengers, the public and crew members from other buses too jumped into the fight. In the resultant melee, the toll plaza was vandalised.

Police said that the toll staff had lodged a complaint stating that ₹18 lakh was stolen from the counters in the plaza. “We are checking the CCTV footage to verify the claim,” said a police officer.

Meanwhile, it has come to light that the police had to fire one round to disperse the violent mob. Hearing the news, the police rushed to the spot. However, they were outnumbered. “The situation was getting out of control and to disperse the crowd, an officer fired one round in the air. It was only following this that the situation was brought under control,” said a police source. Five persons, including the driver, conductor and toll plaza staff Muthu were arrested.

On Tuesday, a high-level meeting of officials of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Transport Department was held during which it was decided to sensitise both toll plaza staff and bus crew about how to deal with each other.

In December 2019, radio frequency enabled FASTag card facility was introduced at toll plazas across the country. The NHAI has been insisting that vehicles obtain the cards so that payment can be quick and human intervention can be minimised since the money is deducted automatically. However, State-run transport corporation buses are yet to procure the cards due to various issues. NHAI sources said that the issue would be sorted in a week’s time.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yk5dg9/article30660950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WhatsApp-Image-2020-01-26-at-43205-PM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/18-lakh-missing-from-paranur-toll-plaza-after-sundays-violence/article30679012.ece
419,2020/01/29,Panchayat president arranges vans for girls to reach school in Thandalacheri,"Due to insufficient and overcrowded buses, girls students from Thandalacheri village in Gummidipoondi have been struggling to reach their school on time. To help these children, the village panchayat president has arranged two vans to ferry them free of cost.

There are over 100 students, mostly girls, from Thandalacheri who study in a government school located more than 5 km away in Kavarapettai.

There are five buses plying through this village and the services are erratic.

“Most of the buses towards Kavarapettai, one stop after our village, start from Madarpakkam. So, most of the buses come jam-packed. The students find it hard to get inside,” said S. Valli, a resident of the village.

Similar is the situation while returning from school. “Most of the male students travel on footboard endangering their lives. But the girls are unable to get inside and even if they manage to do so, they feel very uncomfortable,” she added.

One of the girls said that most often the buses don’t stop in their village. “So we get late to school. My parents are daily wage earners, they spend ₹20 a day on a van to help me reach school on time,” said a student.

Since the present panchayat president D. Anandaraj has also experienced the same problem during school and college days, he had assured to solve this problem once he gets elected. “I purchased two vans and have also appointed a driver and conductor for the van. I don’t want any school dropouts due to lack of bus connectivity,” he said.

Students block bus

Meanwhile, government school students in Nemam village in Madurantakam blocked a government bus angered over poor service.

According to police, the government bus is operated at 8.30 a.m and 5.30 p.m. However, for the past several days the bus service was erratic and they were not able to reach their school in Acharappakam on time.

425,2020/01/29,‘CAA attempts to de-citizenise Muslims’,"The resonances between what is happening now in India with regard to Muslims and the beginning of the processes in Germany that resulted in the genocide of Jews cannot be missed, said Sashi Kumar, Chairman, Asian College of Journalism, here on Tuesday.

During a panel discussion that followed the screening of the critically acclaimed documentary ‘Shoah’ to mark the 75th year of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, he said that the idea of ‘othering’ a group of people, which seems to be beginning in India, was deeply problematic.

Referring to the Citizenship Amendment Act that excludes Muslims from its ambit, he said that the Act in a way attempts to ‘de-citizenise’ Muslims or think of them as those who do not require citizenship.

Pointing out to the idea of “delousing” or the metaphor of “lice” being used for Jews in Nazi Germany, he asked when a leader in India used the word ‘termites’ to refer to a group of people, a sense of foreboding of a similar thought process here cannot be ignored.

Stressing on the relevance of the documentary to the present, Helmut Schippert, director, Max Mueller Bhavan, Chennai, said that there was a perceptible rise of right wing extremists in Germany now. “They should be called right extremists and not right populists,” he said.

He added that right extremists secured 25% of votes in three federal States of Germany in the last election.

426,2020/01/29,Fatal accident in Vadapalani terminus comes as a rude wake-up call,"The fatal accident in the Vadapalani bus depot-cum-terminus came as a rude wake-up call for the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) to pay attention to public and workers’ safety.

The mowing down of two mechanics and injury to six workers inside the Vadapalani bus depot on July 28 last year made the senior officials of the transport corporation to order an internal safety audit to be carried out in all the 34 bus termini-cum-depots.

The financially stretched transport corporation has been taking baby steps to renovate bus termini in Tondiarpet, Iyyappanthangal, Pattulos Road, K.K. Nagar and Kannagi Nagar.

A senior official of MTC said based on the technical committee formed specially to conduct the safety audit in all the depots, various parameters have been covered including the structural stability of buildings, inspection and installation of safety blocking wall in the maintenance shed and construction of safety pit.

As part of the safety audit, the MTC had already completed renovating two bus termini in Iyappanthangal and Tondiarpet. The Tondiarpet bus depot-cum-termini has been decorated with wall art.

A senior official said the compound wall around the Kannagi Nagar bus terminus was decorated with various paintings and a small herbal park has been created.

The Rotary Club of Alandur has come forward to maintain the herbal park located inside the Kannagi bus terminus, he added.

Also giving importance to passenger safety, old compound walls were demolished and rebuilt at Avadi and Mandaveli, new passenger waiting shelter provided at Iyappanthangal, electricity room shutdown at Gandhi Nagar bus terminus, and new toilets constructed for passengers at Vadapalani.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6s7yg1/article30678768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THBUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fatal-accident-in-vadapalani-terminus-comes-as-a-rude-wake-up-call/article30678769.ece
427,2020/01/29,"City’s bus termini in dire condition, cry for a makeover","Hop, skip and jump — this is what commuters are forced to do at the Broadway bus terminus, one of the busy terminals in the city, owing to encroachments and the garbage littered on the floor. The promise to improve passenger amenities on the premises has remained an unfulfilled promise for the past many years.

This is not a lone example of the poor condition of bus termini. Most in the city are in a terrible condition and without basic amenities. The MTC operates over 3,600 buses across the city. There are 71 bus termini in the Greater Chennai limits, including adjoining districts. While 34 are maintained by the MTC, the remaining are taken care of by the respective local bodies.

A visit to some of the termini showed them to be in a very bad shape. While the surface is uneven in most of them, many do not have toilets for passengers. In some, cows were tethered to posts and cattle were found loitering freely amidst the buses.

‘Flooded during rain’

“Most of the termini are below road level and during monsoon, these places get flooded. It then becomes difficult for passengers to go inside,” said M. Somasundaram, liaison officer, Consumer Association of India. He attends the Voluntary Consumer Organisations’ quarterly meeting with MTC officials, including the public utility’s Managing Director and Depot Managers. The last such meeting was held in September.

Among the low lying termini is Thiruvanmiyur. “Buses to different parts of the city are operated from here. But it is in a pathetic condition; the surface is bad. When we complain to the officials, they brush it aside saying that the [Thiruvanmiyur] terminus will be demolished soon for some development work,” alleged S. Rajendran, a passenger.

The T. Nagar Bus Terminus, an important one in the city, is highly cramped. “At least seven buses enter and exit the terminus every minute, but the bus bays are insufficient. Though some bio-toilets are kept near the Madley Road entrance, people urinate around it and the stench is unbearable,” said M. Mugilan, a regular commuter.

Meanwhile, at the Villivakkam Bus Terminus, commuters have to jostle for space with cattle. “Cows move freely in the terminus as a cattle shed is located nearby. It is very difficult to start the bus in the morning as animals sleep under the vehicles. The stench is also unbearable,” said a bus driver.

R.K. Ravichandran, secretary, Ayyapanthangal and Baraniputhur Consumer Protection Society, said that the Ayyapanthangal Terminus is littered with garbage. “After much struggle, the toilets are now maintained well. But there is need for better illumination too,” he said.

A. P. Srinivasan, executive secretary, Consumer Protection Forum, said that the Tiruvottiyur Bus Terminus was shifted to a nearby vacant government land in view of Chennai Metro Rail work. “Earlier, public urinals were there, but not now. This has led to open defecation,” he explained.

‘Elders worst-hit’

Apart from this, Mr. Srinivasan stressed the need for a public address system, and bus bays.

“It has been one year since the terminus was shifted. By now, they should have introduced the facilities. There is also a need for seating facilities. Without this, senior citizens are struggling,” he added.

K. Natarajan, treasurer of MTC’s union Labour Progressive Federation, said that there are no urinals at the Anna Square Terminus, which is thronged by thousands of commuters every day. “We have made several representations, but to no avail,” he said.

‘Modernisation soon’

Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar said that some of the terminals may be modernised in the coming years. Mr. Vijayabhaskar claimed that he and his team visited termini in the city and found that most of them are in a bad shape as they are very old.

“They are below road level. There are plans to have multi-level bus terminus in Thiruvanmiyur, Vadapalani, T. Nagar and modernise them,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ujy5jh/article30678745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th29MTCcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/citys-bus-termini-in-dire-condition-cry-for-a-makeover/article30678746.ece
428,2020/01/29,"The continuing theme of uncertainty, volatility","The image of a darkening world which haunted 2019 continues, even as 2020 commences. Together with increased turbulence, what is evident is that the world is regressing in several directions. Democracy and democratic freedoms are coming under increasing attack accompanied by a retreat from liberalism and globalisation. This is not limited to any one country or a group of countries, but is evident across much of the world.

Global ruptures

Geopolitical fault-lines widened in 2019. America’s leadership of the world came under increasing threat from countries such as China. The future of the United Kingdom, under the shadow of Brexit, remained unclear. Europe seemed to be in eclipse. Latin and Central America were in turmoil. In Asia, Afghanistan appeared to be at a crossroads in its history. Instability plagued Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Egypt. Civil war conditions prevailed in many regions. Violent protests raged in many domains, including Hong Kong, once a symbol of “One Country Two Systems”. Existing threats to the security of nations remained unchanged, even as offensive cyber-attacks became the new weapon of choice in many situations.

As 2020 progresses, the spectre that haunts nations is, if anything, bleaker. Geopolitically, it would be tempting to assert that this is perhaps the most troubled time in recent history, given the looming spectre of an all-out war between Iran and the United States. Exertion of “maximum pressure” by the U.S. to minimise Iran’s influence and reduce its support to proxies in the region and elsewhere, combined with Iran’s only slightly less provocative posture as seen towards the end of 2019, had resulted in a major stand-off by the beginning of 2020. Following the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, one of Iran’s top Generals and Commander of its Qods Force, and several of his associates, in a U.S.-directed air strike in the vicinity of Baghdad Airport, the extent of fury in Iran and Iraq, and to a large extent across the entire Muslim world, has been intense. This has put both the region and the world in grave jeopardy.

Domestic tensions

From a national perspective, 2019 posited at best, a mixed bag. Political tensions had intensified in the first half of the year in view of the General Elections held in April-May, and against the backdrop of victories of Opposition parties in the Assembly Elections in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh towards the end of 2018. Acrimony over allegations of corruption, especially over the Rafale fighter aircraft deal, had further vitiated the political atmosphere.

Well before this, in February 2019, a relative calm that had existed on the terror front since November 2008 — though in the intervening years, terror attacks of a lesser magnitude had taken place — – had been shattered when a suicide bomber (owing allegiance to Pakistan’s Jaish-e-Mohammed), carried out a massive explosive attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Pulwama, killing 44 personnel. In retaliation, India carried out an aerial strike on a JeM training camp in Balakot, inside Pakistan, causing unspecified damage, the first time since 1971 that India had used air power to attack targets inside Pakistan. It briefly raised the spectre of a direct confrontation with Pakistan.

In the second half of 2019, the Government embarked on two controversial pieces of legislation. In August 2019, Parliament diluted Article 370 of the Constitution, and carved out two Union Territories of Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh from the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir. This was accompanied by a massive clampdown, including a communication blackout, and the arrest of almost the entire top leadership of the political establishment in J&K; this included three former Chief Ministers. Violence following this move was seen to be limited, but the mood remained sullen.

In the final weeks of 2019, the Government initiated another controversial move to push through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which is implicitly seen as linked to a National Register of Citizens, though the Government (after having indicated at one point about such linkage) has since declared that this is not the case. It provoked widespread protests on the ground that the legislation violated some of the basic precepts of the Constitution, and applied the test of religion, to exclude (Muslim) refugees from neighbouring countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, from being given Indian citizenship.

Neighbourhood ties

As 2020 commences, India’s foreign policy challenges remain very considerable. India-Pakistan relations remain frozen, even as Pakistan continues to make overtures to the U.S., and further cements its relationship with China at one level and Saudi Arabia at another. Sino-Indian relations continue to be riddled with numerous problems. The vexed Sino-Indian border dispute remains in deep freeze. China, meanwhile, has embarked more aggressively on establishing its leadership across Asia; in the shadow play for influence across parts of Asia, including South Asia, China seems to be gaining at India’s expense.

India’s attempts at creating a supportive environment in its immediate neighbourhood in 2020 remains equally challenging. While relations with the Maldives improved during the past year, the advent of a new Government in Sri Lanka, headed by the Rajapaksas, does not augur too well for India. Relations with Bangladesh appear satisfactory on the surface, but underlying strains are emerging. Relations with the United Arab Emirates are better than at any time previously, but the India-Saudi Arabia relationship can at best be termed uncertain. Relations with Iran are likely to become highly problematic, in view of India’s “tilt” towards the U.S., and the open hostility on display currently between Iran and the U.S.

Issues within

On the domestic front, India again will need to find solutions to quite a few thorny problems. Removing tight controls in J&K and restoring civil liberties there, including the release of senior political leaders, will require very deft handling, given the “pressure cooker” atmosphere that prevails. India will also need to watch out for a very different type of agitation in J&K, something between “civil disobedience” and an “intifada type” struggle.

While India appears reasonably well-positioned to deal with some of the other internal threats, including insurgencies in the North-east, Naxalite violence, and the “terror imperative”, the fallout of protests over the CAA has the potential to become India’s most serious threat in decades. Already, it is aggravating the fault-lines in society and this could become the harbinger of a highly divisive period in India’s recent history.

Already, the eddies of controversy over this and other disparate issues are beginning to coalesce into a major maelstrom of protests, with India’s youth, including many belonging to universities and higher institutes of learning, up in arms on manifold issues. At present these seem to have little in common, excepting opposition to those in authority for the latter’s perceived insensitivity to public protests. When assaults on students of Jamia Milia University or Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi become a common platform of protest for students across the nation, it, however, marks a significant shift in public opinion. Perceived insensitivity by those in authority to such protests, and misguided attempts to polarise opinion in these circumstances can prove to be short sighted.

Managing the economy

Furthermore, given the current economic malaise facing the country, which can hardly be treated as a cyclical phenomenon, the economic portents for 2020 also do not look too good. For several months now, the country has witnessed the slowing down of the economy and India’s growth story appears set to lose much of its shine. A sustained below 5% GDP growth could become a recipe for disaster. Already, India is being mentioned as among 2020’s top geopolitical risks.

Given the total impact of the various aspects, those in charge would do well to be aware of and prepare for the major problems that lie ahead. The digital revolution that is under way and the awesome power of Artificial Intelligence, Machine-Learning, Quantum Computing and Bio-Technology may not be enough in the circumstances.

429,2020/01/29,Selling a state airline,"The Air India ‘Maharaj’ is a white elephant (Front page, “Govt. sweetens Air India offer, puts 100% stake on the table,” Jan. 28). Even the government’s offer to write off a debt of about ₹40,000 crore is unlikely to attract purchasers. This only underlines the fact that owning Air India will involve other issues, particularly paying lease amount for half of its fleet. These leased aircraft could returned, but this would also mean that a substantial number of crew members lose their jobs, in which case humongous amount must be paid by way of compensation. Unless the management resolves such issues, not much headway can be made. Even if there is a concession that the bid amount can be paid in phases, there would be no buyers unless Air India is downsized considerably.

Tirupur, Tamil Nadu

Selling assets of the government is never a good decision. Air India and Indian Airlines should not have been merged in the first place. Second, long, profitable routes should not have been taken away from Air India and given to foreign airlines. It is sad that Air India did not get a level-playing field against competition. Under the circumstances, I wish that Tatas bid for the company.

Ramani Subramaniam Krishnan,

Mumbai

The Union government’s invitation for bids for a 100% stake sale of Air India (AI) is a national shame. One feels the founder and erstwhile owner of the carrier, J.R.D. Tata would have shed tears on hearing the news. Dubai, smaller than even some of India’s small States, is proud to have one of the most internationally acclaimed airlines, the Emirates, offering the best services across the globe. Air India needs to learn a lesson or two from the Emirates in managing the show.

Why did the government not utilise the services of experts produced by our prestigious management institutions to bail the national carrier out of the red? Does the proposed sale provide some indicator to the kind of ‘development’ the Modi-led government has in store?

A. Jainulabdeen,

Air India is not just an airline. It is a cultural symbol, one that has been ferrying people to every nook and corner of the country, at a time when airlines look for only profitable routes. The national carrier was destroyed as profit-making routes were, in steps, handed over to private players. Passengers who travel with Air India will vouch for the wonderful flying experience, with the well-trained pilots manoeuvring the aircraft skilfully.

430,2020/01/29,Abolishing upper house,"The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP)-controlled Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly’s approval of a resolution to abolish the Legislative Council is a ploy to scuttle the Opposition. The move comes on the heels of the Telugu Desam Party, which is in the majority in the Council, blocking the Jaganmohan Reddy government’s plans to shift the executive capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam. With Andhra Pradesh’s coffers empty and the Chief Minister bent on having three capitals, hundreds of kilometres away from each other, the move could further drain the State’s resources (Editorial, “Abolition politics,” Jan. 28).

N.J. Ravi Chander,

The Chief Minister’s haphazard decisions have shocked the people of Andhra Pradesh. There is at present no public demand for abolishing the Legislative Council and the move seems solely in response to the Council’s decision on his three-capital proposal. These developments also point out the need for clear parliamentary guidelines on the creation and abolition of such chambers.

This is with reference to the news “We know political parties use SC to settle scores, says CJI” (Jan. 27). The Chief Justice’s comments mirror what the people of the country feel after observing cases involving politicians. Cases are taken to the apex court with political motives, burdening the institution. Though judiciary is the ultimate destination to deliver justice to all affected parties, it is even a common man’s perception that our Supreme Court is being made to bite more than it can chew. This constricts the space for people to get justice since political cases receive priority treatment. It is no exaggeration to say that Supreme Court judges are straining their nerves for the quick disposal of legal disputes. It is fit to recall that judges earlier are sometimes ready to work even during summer vacations.

432,2020/01/29,Scholar Sastri @ 150,"As the death anniversary of the Father of the Nation approaches, it is worth commemorating another eloquent son of the soil who was born in the same year as Mahatma Gandhi. V.S. Srinivasa Sastri, born just 10 days prior to Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, won a multitude of admirers due to his unparalleled English diction. He rode like a colossus and his sparkling speech at the League of Nations, where he was representing India as a delegate, still stands as a shining example of how English should be spoken. Though his views on politics were different and, at times, diametrically opposite to those of Gandhiji, both remained close friends till the end.

This master of a flawless accent had humble beginnings in Kumbakonam as the son of a poor priest, with his parents finding his primary education largely unaffordable. However, his academic excellence helped him graduate at the Government Arts College in Kumbakonam in 1988 and find employment at Municipal College, Salem. Sastri edited The Educational Review and later also founded the journal Indian Review. His potential was recognised by Gopal Krishna Gokhale, who urged him to become a member of the Servants of India Society. On Gokhale’s demise, he took over the reins of the Society. From then on, Dame Fortune held Sastri in her tight hug. Accolades started pouring in and he never looked back. Between 1920 and 1922, Sastri first joined the Council of States, then became a Member at the Imperial Council and and toured extensively countries like Canada, Australia and New Zealand. As India’s delegate to the Second and Third Round Table Conferences, he took Gandhiji’s remarks in 1931 with a pinch of salt.

Will it not be in the fitness of things if the Tamil Nadu government installs a statue of this gargantuan personality and the Centre places a photograph of this icon in the amalgam of other photos hung in the Centre hall of Parliament?

433,2020/01/29,Ashok Chavan urged to steer clear of controversy,"A group of young Congress Ministers in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Wednesday requested senior party leader and Public Works Department Minister Ashok Chavan to avoid making controversial statements that can destabilise the government.

Mr. Chavan had claimed this week that Congress president Sonia Gandhi had sought a written undertaking from Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that the government would work within the ambit of the Constitution. While the Sena denied the claim, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) said the only written document the three parties had inked was the common minimum programme.

A Congress Minister said, “There have been several comments and replies made to them. This creates unnecessary tension and an atmosphere of confusion among party workers and citizens.” He said the party’s State unit sees repeated controversies as a hindrance to the functioning of the government.

The Minister said, “We can only put in a request to our senior leaders. As long as the government is following the common minimum programme, there should not be any problem in its functioning.”

Of the three parties, the Congress has struggled to come to terms with being in an alliance with the Sena. The NCP has found itself playing the role of a mediator with the Congress locking horns with the Sena over statements on Hindutva ideologue V.D.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has decided to give elected members of the panchayat the right to elect the sarpanch and do away with direct elections.

Earlier, the government had scrapped direct elections to appoint municipal council heads and the system of having four corporators in each ward. In 2017, the previous BJP-led government had introduced direct election for the sarpanch’s post, which led to delays in developmental projects and political infighting. Since then, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party have been demanding that the decision be reversed.

Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif said the old rule “stopped developmental works in villages and affected the overall functioning of panchayats” as the elected members and the sarpanch ended up being from different groups or parties.

Mr. Mushrif said, “We don’t directly elect our Prime Minister or the Chief Minister. Why then should there be a different pattern at the village level?

435,2020/01/29,Aarey colony shortlisted for car shed without planning: expert panel,"An expert panel constituted on December 17, 2019, to find an alternative site for the Metro 3 car shed has said poor planning by the previous Bharatiya Janata Party-led (BJP) government had resulted in Aarey colony being shortlisted for the project.

According to global norms, the car shed site’s size must correspond with the length of the Metro corridor, the panel said. After studying international projects in several South Asian countries, the panel recommended setting apart a minimum of 25 hectares for such projects. The panel’s report, which was submitted to the Chief Minister on Tuesday, said the plot in Aarey colony, with a buildable area of 23 hectares, falls short of the global standard.

The four-member committee also ruled out Kanjurmarg and SRPF Ground in Jogeshwari as alternative sites for the car shed. The report warned of a 24% escalation in cost if the Metro 3 is extended by seven kilometres to Kanjurmarg. The report said merging Metro 3 with Metro 6 (Lokhandwala-Jogeshwari-Vikhroli-Kanjurmarg) is not technically and financially feasible. According to the panel, a merger will have signalling and operational impact on both lines, thereby affecting their frequency and capacity.

A member of the committee said, “Even if Metro 3 is extended to Kanjurmarg with the purpose of merging it with Metro 6, at least 16 stabling lines will still have to be maintained inside Aarey colony for parking trains. Therefore, Kanjurmarg as an alternative site will still not fully vacate the Aarey plot.” At present, 35 stabling lines for parking trains have been proposed at the car shed site in Aarey colony.

On Wednesday, Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray said there was no reason to worry as the Chief Minister’s Office is still studying the report. “The recommendations of the report are not binding. The final decision will be taken after studying the report,” he said after witnessing the 25th breakthrough of Metro 3 project’s tunnel boring machine at Worli. Mr. Thackeray said he would be consulting environmentalists as they have been a part of the Save Aarey movement.

‘Revoke stay order’

On Wednesday, former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya demanded that Mr. Thackeray revoke the stay on construction at the car shed site as the delay of over 60 days had caused a loss of ₹600 crore.

437,2020/01/29,Cong. poll promise of 500 sq.ft. houses not progressing: Milind Deora,"Congress leader Milind Deora has written to party chief Sonia Gandhi expressing concern over Rahul Gandhi’s 2019 poll promise of allotting 500 sq.ft. homes to Mumbai slum dwellers not moving “effectively” towards implementation under the new dispensation in the State.

Mr. Deora urged Ms. Gandhi to establish a mechanism in the State, which is being ruled by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, to ensure that the government delivers on the promises made by the Congress to the people.

In his letter, dated January 24, Mr. Deora said that upon his advice in March 2019, then Congress president Rahul Gandhi had said at a rally that 500 sq.ft. homes under slum and dilapidated building rehabilitation schemes will be allotted, if his party is voted to power. “This promise was later included in the common minimum programme worked out by the three parties,” Mr. Deora said. At present, 269 sq.ft. houses are provided under the slum redevelopment projects in the city.

To drive home his point, Mr. Deora recalled former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi supporting efforts initiated by his late father Murli Deora to give affordable housing to the needy in Mumbai since 1984. “Voters of Mumbai have since trusted the Congress and rewarded it for its commitment towards uplifting those at the bottom of the pyramid,” he said.

“Rahulji’s promise was made to Mumbaikars when he was Congress president. It concerns me that such an important policy initiative has still not moved effectively towards implementation,” Mr. Deora said. The former Mumbai Congress president said that various other “realistic and feasible” promises too were made to people during the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in 2019.

“I therefore request you to consider establishing an effective mechanism in Maharashtra, similar to the one in (other) Congress-governed States, so that the government may speedily deliver on the poll promises made by Congress to the voters of Maharashtra,” he said.

Mr. Deora also said the party’s allies, Sena and NCP, had worked to implement all their poll promises in the past 50 days.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/s383kp/article30680894.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMMILINDDEORA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cong-poll-promise-of-500-sqft-houses-not-progressing-milind-deora/article30680895.ece
438,2020/01/29,"Poor bear brunt of ecological degradation, says IIT professor","Economically disadvantaged people are the worst hit during ecological degradation, Professor Shyam Asolekar from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, said on Tuesday. “Poor people get affected the most in whatever change that comes, we have seen (that) in our research,” Prof. Asolekar said, in an address to journalists at a workshop conducted by the Forum of Environmental Journalists in India.

Prof. Asolekar was on the technical committee to decide whether the car shed for Metro 3 should be at Aarey. He had given a dissenting note in his recommendation and at the workshop, said he stuck to his stand. Prof. Asolekar highlighted that episodic pollution like the ones caused by accidents were practically ignored and there was no measurement of the long-term damage done to the environment.

The theme of the workshop, hosted by the Mumbai Press Club, was ‘Urban Climate Resilience: Aarey and Mumbai City’.

Urban planner Hussain Indorewala said the current climate crisis was due to past emissions. The current infrastructure projects of the city, he said, did not seem to acknowledge the crisis or the rising water levels. Mr. Indorewala also spoke about the lack of sustainable mobility planning in the city with more focus being given to car-centric infrastructure such as roads.

Urban planner Sulakshana Mahajan said the word ‘smart’ was being used as it was catchy but it was more hype than reality. “Real-time data collection is a must. In 2021, we will do the Census and will get the data in 2025. What’s the use? By this time, the city has grown and changed,” she said.

She said urban planning involves problem solving at three levels: the neighbourhood, the city and the region. “The Metro is city-level infrastructure and not neighbourhood-level infrastructure. It will affect Girgaum and Aarey differently. Each locality has also to be understood in the context of the Metro,” she said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fs41e1/article30678972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bm-Screen,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/poor-bear-brunt-of-ecological-degradation-says-iit-professor/article30678973.ece
439,2020/01/29,DPS snake bite: school carries out sanitisation of premises,"After a snake bit a Class II student on the premises of Delhi Public School (DPS) in Nerul, the principal on Sunday held an emergency meeting with members of the parent-teacher association to discuss the incident.

“It was my moral responsibility to apologise to the parents and I did that. We also declared a three-day holiday till Wednesday for students up to Class V and a two-day holiday for those in Classes VI to IX. We used these days to sanitise the school. Professionals were hired for the work and steps that can be taken to prevent reptiles from entering the premises were discussed with them. We have also ordered solar snake repellents from Delhi. As of now they have only two pieces and we need at least 30,” principal J. Mohanty said.

Another group of 40 parents met Mr. Mohanty on Monday. “Since the principal himself called a meeting the previous day, parents were less anxious and happy that the school took cognisance of the issue and was willing to work on it. During the meeting, we insisted that the school make students aware of what should be done if they see a snake or find a snake bite on themselves. Most importantly, we asked them to train nurses to identify snake and other venomous bites and what must be done in such situations,” a parent who was part of the meeting said.

Ishayu Sen (7) was bitten by a snake in school on Friday and rushed to the hospital in a deep coma. He was saved in the nick of time after being put on life support and an antivenin treatment. “He regained consciousness in a few hours and was in the condition to speak to me the same day. I am thankful that the teachers took him to hospital immediately without waiting for any protocol. The school has constantly been in touch with us, checking on Ishayu’s well-being. Once he was fully conscious, he told me that he felt the hurt while going down the stairs but he did not see any creature,” Soumi Sen, the boy’s mother, said.

She said that while the doctors had their suspicions about the snake bite, it was confirmed when Ishayu reacted well to the antivenin treatment. He has now been discharged and the parents have been asked to be careful with his wound since it is still swollen.

Suresh Kharat, a Ghansoli-based sarpmitra, said cobras and Russell’s vipers usually come out to mate in this month. “Since it is winter, snakes prefer to stay inside the burrow and come out only to mate. The eggs then takes around three months to hatch, which is around monsoon, when there is an abundance of water and insects to feed on,” he said.

Mr. Kharat said snakes don’t usually bite, unless someone steps within a one-foot radius of their head. “If someone steps beyond the one-foot territory, the snake tries to escape. In this case, the symptoms and description of wound makes it seem like the child was attacked by a Russell’s viper.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dps-snake-bite-school-carries-out-sanitisation-of-premises/article30678968.ece

A resident of Aai Ekvira apartment in Ghansoli, Mr. Patil lived on the ground floor with his father while his wife, Rekha, and son stayed separately and ran a general store nearby.

Mr. Patil’s elder brother, Shankar, lived on the third floor of the building with his wife Alka and daughter Asha.

Mr. Patil had dumped a lot of garbage outside his house and Alka told him that it didn’t look good. This irked him and he attacked her and Asha with a knife. “After they were stabbed, they rushed into a flat where Shivnath Shukla, a tenant, lives and cried for help. When Mr. Shukla tried to intervene, Mr. Patil stabbed him too. By then, Rekha and Shankar came to know of the fight and they reached the spot.

441,2020/01/29,"Food trucks will eat into our business, say restaurateurs","The Indian Hotel and Restaurants Association (AHAR) has objected to the proposed food truck policy on the ground that they may hamper the business of small restaurants if allowed to run 24x7. In a letter to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), AHAR has raised issues of hygiene, safety and licences among other things.

Over the weekend, the State government facilitated a policy wherein establishments in areas such as Kala Ghoda, Bandra Kurla Complex and Nariman Point were allowed to operate 24x7. While Mumbaikars did not particularly warm up to the idea, industry leaders hoped that with increased awareness, it would work.

The BMC had discussed its food truck policy during a meeting on the Mumbai 24x7 scheme chaired by Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray last week. The policy was tabled before the group leaders’ meeting unofficially last year, but is now back to the drawing board. The policy will come into effect with the Municipal Commissioner’s assent.

During this meeting, it was discussed that food trucks will be allowed at six locations — Juhu Chowpatty road, Girgaum Chowpatty road, BKC, Worli Sea Face, Bandstand and Nariman Point. It was also decided that a maximum of five trucks will be allowed in one area, that they will be allowed only from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., not more than four folding tables (16 seats) will be allowed, that they can cover only 40% of the footpath, and the minimum distance between two trucks should be 20 metres.

However, some of these rules may change.

Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We are not allowing any cooking inside the truck; food can only be microwaved and served. The timing of the food trucks will be based on the Shops and Establishments Act, which means the BMC will regulate it. So far, there is no decision to keep them open 24x7. Also, we may not allow seating there as that could lead to encroachment in future. They will need all the existing licences for an eating house along with a new food truck licence which we will start issuing.”

The policy looks to ensure food trucks are not parked within 200 metres of restaurants. The BMC will also allow these trucks to be parked in empty spaces in parking lots. The spaces are to be assigned by assistant commissioners of the relevant wards and once allotted, the truck will be parked there. The policy is still in the draft stage and following the Municipal Commissioner’s approval, will have to be approved by civic group leaders.

Meanwhile, an AHAR delegation met the executive health officer of BMC, Padmaja Keskar, on Monday and submitted its objections.

AHAR secretary Niranjan Shetty said, “Initially, we were told that food trucks would only be allowed at night, but if they are allowed 24x7, that would impact restaurants. Besides, food trucks might become like hawking, there will be no level-playing field for restaurants.”

In its letter, AHAR cited a Supreme Court order prohibiting roadside cooking, traffic, law and order issues and the lack of running water among other things. The association wants restaurants near railway stations and State Transport depots to be kept open instead where commuters and long-distance travellers can benefit.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/yg77ps/article30655222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BMPhoenix-Market-City-Kurla,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/food-trucks-will-eat-into-our-business-say-restaurateurs/article30678885.ece

According to CR officials, the AC local on the Trans-Harbour line will be flagged off from Thane around 3.30 p.m. by Minister of State for Railways, Suresh Angadi.

16 services daily

From Friday, there will be 16 services every day between Thane and Vashi, with three services during the morning and evening peak hours. The AC local, which arrived in December, has been fitted with CCTV cameras in all its coaches and will also have an escort squad from the Railway Protection Force (RPF) for security.

“There will be two male and one female RPF staff aboard the train to ensure safety during the first runs of the train. We will decide after a month if we need to extend the security,” said a senior RPF official.

The official said the RPF has also made an official request for installation of CCTV cameras outside the motorman and guard’s cabins in order to spot stone pelters or miscreants who aim at the rake.

New rakes to come

CR officials also said they will receive two additional rakes in the coming month, one of which will be inducted next week but will be kept as a spare.

“We are planning to run the third rake as an additional service. However, we haven’t worked out the modalities,” a CR official said.

It is not right to say just one party did so, NCP leader and Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik said here on Tuesday.

His statement comes against the controversy generated by Public Works Department Minister and Congress leader Ashok Chavan who said on Monday that his party president Sonia Gandhi had sought written undertaking from Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray that the government would work within the ambit of Constitution.

“All three parties had held meetings in Delhi and Mumbai before forming the government and worked out the CMP, signed by leaders of all three parties,” said Mr. Malik.

Following the controversy, Mr. Chavan on Tuesday tried to calm things down saying he did not oppose anyone. “I was talking about the CMP. It is a written document. I spoke only on CMP and nothing else. The news reports are conflicting with my original statement,” said Mr. Chavan.

The former chief minister said that there was no problem in the working of the government. “We are all together,” he said.

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said in Pune that nothing can happen to the government until it is being run by the strong determination of NCP chief Sharad Pawar, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Mr. Thackeray. “However it is always better to avoid controversial statements,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mva-allies-agree-to-cmp-nothing-else-nawab-malik/article30678800.ece
444,2020/01/29,"CIDCO asked to scrap Nerul golf course project, say activists","After constantly following up with State Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray, environmentalists from Navi Mumbai finally managed to organise a meeting with him in his Mantralaya office on Monday.

At the meeting, Mr. Thackeray reportedly asked CIDCO’s managing director Lokesh Chandra to scrap the golf course project in Nerul. On January 12, CIDCO had felled close to 700 trees at a plot on Palm Beach Road, near NRI Complex Phase II, It was proposed that a golf course and 17 residential towers be built there.

During the meeting, which was attended by activists Sunil and Shruti Agarwal from Save Navi Mumbai Environment and Mr. Chandra, Mr. Thackeray said the environment must be preserved. “Mr. Thackeray said that dumping of debris like this will not be tolerated and asked for the golf course project to be scrapped,’ Mr. Agarwal said.

He said the Environment Minister asked authorities to plan a flamingo sanctuary at the Talawe and TS Chanakya wetlands instead.

“We are very happy with Mr. Thackeray’s proactive pro-environment stance and hope the decision to declare 33 hectares of wetlands as a flamingo sanctuary is implemented at the earliest. We are also hopeful that CIDCO will withdraw the special leave petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court to avoid wastage of money and time in unnecessary litigation as these wetlands are part of National Wetlands inventory,” Mr. Agarwal said.

According to him, of the 35.55 hectares set aside for the project, 33.45 hectares are wetlands.

When Mr. Chandra was asked about the status of the golf course, he said the matter was in court. However, on being asked about the meeting, he did not respond. Several calls and messages to Mr. Thackeray too went unanswered.

“The tree cutting in pockets D and E of the land in Sector 60 reminds me of dumping of debris in wetlands in the same pockets in October 2017. The earlier incident forced me to file a public interest litigation in the Bombay High Court and the court had directed CIDCO to stop all construction by an order dated November 2, 2018,” Mr. Agarwal said

“Both CIDCO and a private construction company had filed a SLP in the Supreme Court and the hearing is still on. It was shocking to see such a massive cutting of trees while the matter was in litigation,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cidco-asked-to-scrap-nerul-golf-course-project-say-activists/article30678775.ece
445,2020/01/29,"Gathering of hijab-wearing women to break barriers, bust misconceptions","On Instagram, 19-year-old Haleema Momin calls herself ‘Hijabi Beast’. The athlete from Jogeshwari who performs callisthenics stands out not only for her choice of career but also her attire.

“People who don’t know about Islam assume that hijab is a sign of oppression. For me, the hijab brings a sense of security, strength and dignity. I get a lot of support and attention because of my hijab,” said Ms. Momin, who is trained in powerlifting and martial arts.

Extraordinary feats

The teenager, who works as a personal trainer, is all set to perform a range of moves like the headstand, handstand, superman push-ups and flips at YB Chavan auditorium on February 1, World Hijab Day. She will share stage with an international karate referee, a biker, a calligrapher and other women who wear the hijab by choice and take pride in it.

The first-of-its-kind event has been organised by the non-profit Al Hadi Organisation with the aim of shattering the popular belief that the hijab is an obligation and not a choice. “I started wearing the hijab at the age of 41. It was a sudden consciousness that dawned upon me and I became a hijabi,” said Mazgaon resident Shaheen Akhtar, a World Karate Federation referee and the first female karate referee in south Asia. Ms. Akhtar was lucky that in the same year, 2014, the World Karate Federation introduced the hijab as a part of the attire for referees. Her 26-year-old daughter, who holds an MBA and works with a multinational company, does not wear a hijab. She said, “My mother always told me that our religion calls for it, but never forced me to wear the hijab. I made my own choice and I will let my daughter make her own choice too.”

The event also aims at highlighting the bias against hijabis in schools, colleges and workplaces. “It took so many years for television channels to have hijabi anchors. Why?,” asked 29-year-old Fatema Zaidi Mirza, an anchor with Channel WIN (World Islamic Network) and one of the presenters at the February 1 event. Ms. Mirza will also share her own story of being asked to remove her headscarf while in school, which later resulted in her parents filing a court case. “Even today, there are so many schools that do not allow Muslim girls to wear the hijab and women are asked to remove it at many places,” she said.

Shabana Sadik Husein Pattawala, founder of Al Hadi Organisation, said the event will bring together women from all Muslim sects. She said, “The message we want to spread is that women can do wonders wearing a hijab, and wearing it does not hide their talent. The speakers and performers at the event will bear testimony to this fact.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pdobva/article30678736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMHijab,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gathering-of-hijab-wearing-women-to-break-barriers-bust-misconceptions/article30678738.ece
446,2020/01/29,‘Epitome of every culture has been vocal music’,"Known globally for the gayaki-ang of his sitar playing, maestro Hidayat Hussain Khan, who belongs to the seventh generation of the Imdadkhani gharana, performed in the city last week. In an interview with The Hindu, post concert, Mr. Khan said, “On the surface, [the] epitome of every culture has always been vocal music. Everyone is trying to emulate what the voice does. The limitations of one’s personal capabilities or the instrument they are playing limits them from reaching [perfection],” said Mr. Khan.

The sitar maestro, who lives in New Jersey and Mumbai, started his evening performance at lifestyle and cultural store, Baro, with an evening raga Charukeshi, which was followed by Hazrat Aamir Khusrau’s, ‘Ae Ri Sakhi More’, in raga Khamaaj. Mr. Khan’s speciality, the gayaki-ang, refers to a rendition where the voice blends with the instrument.

As a performer, Mr. Khan has had the good fortune of inheriting a musical legacy from both sides of his family. His father, Ustad Vilayaat Khan had the same legacy, he said. “His mother’s side were all vocalists and father’s side all instrumentalists. He got training in both. He was a very accomplished singer. There are recordings of him where he did vocal concerts.”

Mr. Khan believes that what his father did by introducing the gayaki-ang on sitar made it a complete instrument. “Being a follower of gayaki-ang, it’s very easy collaborating with Western musicians or with musicians of other art forms,” he said.

Mr. Khan is the youngest of four children. On his relationship with his father, he uses four words: “interesting, complicated, fun and serious.”

“While he was teaching me, the formality and protocol would come in. But when the music situation was gone, it was a completely personal relationship with him, just like a father-son,” he said.

Having collaborated with musicians like Ndugu Chancler, Ronnie Woods, Alicia Keys, Usher, Zakir Hussain, Pete Townshend, Jay Z and Darryl Jones, on various occasions, Mr. Khan believes that off-stage conversations with musicians is important for a good performance. In the absence of this, he believes, there is a disconnect in collaborations where two people come with their own ideologies and do their own thing on stage. “For collaborations the most important thing is that you listen to what the other person is saying. And then you take the conversation forward or you reply based on the context of [the chat],” said Mr. Khan.

The maestro said he never expects musicians of classical traditions to get recognised by people while walking down a street or at airports. “If I want recognition of that level then I should be a popular musician. Only then can I expect 10,000 people at every concert. My music is niche,” said Mr. Khan, but added quickly that he is happy at this stage in his career. “Recognition is important but an understanding of correct recognition is even more important. If you have real expectations you won’t be disappointed,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jsw35a/article30678720.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bm-Hidayat-Kha,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/epitome-of-every-culture-has-been-vocal-music/article30678678.ece
447,2020/01/29,Isalak village first to pass resolution against CAA,"On the 71st Republic Day, Isalak, located 10 km away from Ahmednagar, became the first village in Maharashtra to pass a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens.

On Sunday, the proposal was placed before the annual gramsabha of the village, which has a population of about 2,000 people. The villagers unanimously passed the resolution after discussing the provisions of the Act.

Mahadev Gavali, a resident of the village who had proposed the resolution, said many residents of Isalak were illiterate and the Act could pose problems to them. He said, “There is not a single Muslim resident in the village. The population consists of members from Bhilla, Pardhi, Vadar and Dhangar communities, many of which are nomadic tribes. These tribes have settled here, but most of them don’t have any documents.” He said owing to the lack of documents, many villagers are not even able to contest the panchayat elections.

Mr. Gavali said, “Isalak is a small village and everyone knows each other very well. We know that we all are Indians and we don’t think that we need to show proof to the government about our citizenship. If the government wants to carry out the filtration process, it should be limited only to Assam and its neighbouring States. What is the need to bring it to a small village in the opposite direction?” Mr. Gavali said the gramsabha has decided that if the State or Central government forces the law on them, then the village authorities will start a non-cooperation movement.

Amol Shinde, deputy sarpanch, said the residents are already facing problems over the issuance of caste certificate and the government is now asking for more proof to prove their citizenship.

Mr. Shinde said, “The backward castes and tribes of the village are living on government land. Even though the panchayat tries to rehabilitate them under the Aawas Yojana, it is unable to do so due to their lack of documents.”

Mr. Shinde said if the villagers are not able to produce documents to claim benefits under a scheme for subsidised homes, how will they manage to show documents to prove their citizenship? He said, “We talk about the uplift of the backward classes, but then pass such laws that can create more problems for them. Therefore, we decided that at least the people of our village should not undergo any legal hassles due to this Act.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wummcw/article30678674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMIsak-village,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/isalak-village-first-to-pass-resolution-against-caa/article30678675.ece
448,2020/01/29,Mumbai sees seventh organ donation,"After a gap of nearly two years, a public hospital has recorded an organ donation. The family of a 52-year-old man, who was admitted to the civic-run KEM Hospital in Parel, consented to donate his organ after he was declared brain dead by the treating doctors. Only the liver could be retrieved and the organ was sent for transplant to a patient in Apollo Hospital. This marked the seventh organ donation in the city this year.

KEM Hospital’s dean Dr. Hemant Deshmukh said the donor, a resident of Mumbai, was admitted to the hospital with a fall injury and stroke. “His general condition was very poor at the time of admission. He was declared brain dead on Monday night.”

Dr. Deshmukh said the patient’s relative, a paramedic, was aware of the importance of organ donation. “The patient’s wife and son gave their consent for the donation.”

Participation from public hospitals in declaring brain deaths and facilitating donations has been nil for the past several years, even as public hospitals witness a large number of ICU deaths. When the organ donation programme started in 1997, all donations in the first three years were from public hospitals. “We are trying to push the organ donation programme by continuous training and sensitisation of more people,” Dr. Deshmukh said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-sees-seventh-organ-donation/article30678633.ece
449,2020/01/29,MVA govt. plans school curriculum overhaul,"From teaching lesser known qualities and contributions of historical figures such as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar to redesigning the school curriculum to wipe out attempts at saffronisation, a series of meetings within the Education Department is being held to plan a complete overhaul of the curriculum in State board schools.

On January 24, State Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad held a meeting with officials of the department. According to the initial plan, a committee of experts will be formed to list the changes that need to be made in the curriculum to make it more progressive, job-oriented and up to date, an official who attended the meeting said. This could be one of the first challenges of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in terms of policy change.

“History books teach more about the wars that Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj fought than his administrative skills, and contributions in the fields of water conservation, agriculture, and revenue collection. We teach our children that Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar gave India her Constitution, but nothing else,” said the official. The new syllabus will include Dr. Ambedkar’s work in the field of labour laws, irrigation, and contribution towards women’s equality.

‘Gradual process’

The official added, “A committee of experts will give suggestions of the changes that need to be made. It is not a project which will be over in an instant, but one that will happen gradually and steadily.”

The committee has also been tasked with framing the syllabus as per constitutional values. All alleged attempts by the previous government to saffronise the curriculum will be erased, the official said. “The government is also keen on incorporating better practices and experiences from different States, especially Delhi. If they have really done well in the field of education, then there is nothing wrong in learning from them,” the official said.

Ms. Gaikwad also made a presentation showcasing five schools, each from five divisions of the State — Pune, Konkan, Vidarbha, north Maharashtra and Marathwada — which are carrying out experiments in teaching techniques.

The official said, “The plan is to try and centralise different innovative teaching methods used at different places. The department is keen on spreading those techniques all over the State for the benefit of students.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9dt3fa/article30678630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMMUMBAITERROR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mva-govt-plans-school-curriculum-overhaul/article30678631.ece
450,2020/01/29,Nigerian woman accuses three fellow citizens of forcing her into flesh trade,"A 21-year-old Nigerian woman has lodged a complaint against three fellow nationals, including a couple, with the Kharghar police for allegedly forcing her into flesh trade and confining her in a flat. The case was registered on January 15 at Manpada police station and transferred to the Kharghar police on Sunday.

The complainant, a hairstylist from Nasukha in Enugu city, had met a man named Kingsley in January 2019 in Nigeria who had told her that his sister Grace Okhafur was in India and she could help her get a good job there. With the help of Mr. Kingsley she landed in Delhi on June 27, 2019, where an unidentified lady helped her get to Mumbai by booking her a train ticket. On June 28, Ms. Okhafur and her husband, Jan Okhafur, met her at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and took her to their flat in Dombivali.

As per the complaint, on June 29, she was taken to a flat in a society in Sector 30, Kharghar, which belongs to one Ningojhi, another Nigerian national. After reaching there, the complainant was threatened by the couple that she would be killed if she did not cooperate. “According to the complainant, she was forced into prostitution and was compelled to stay with a ‘client’ for over a week in the flat,” police inspector Mahesh Patil from Kharghar police station said.

She was forced into the trade till November 2019, after which she managed to escape. Till then Ms. Okhafur had earned ₹2.23 lakh through the victim and wanted her to earn ₹12 lakh more. After her escape, the complainant approached a Nigerian student and a community welfare association through which she tried to get her passport and visa back from Ms. Okhafur which she refused to give. The victim finally approached the Manpada police and filed a complaint.

Ms. Okhafur and her husband along with Mr. Ningojhi have been booked under Sections 344 (wrongful confinement for 10 or more days), 366B (importation of girl from foreign country), 370A (exploitation of trafficked person), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act.

451,2020/01/29,"HC directs FMCG company, social media influencer to discuss video","The Bombay High Court on Tuesday directed a social media influencer, Abhijeet Bhansali, and one of the leading fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) player, Marico Limited, “to sit across the table and have a discussion” on a video put up by Mr. Bhansali on the company’s oil, Parachute.

Social media influencers are those who have acquired a considerable follower base along with a degree of credibility in their respective space. Depending on the popularity of their field of expertise, their following can range from thousands to millions. These influencers often employ the goodwill they enjoy amongst their followers/viewers to promote a brand, persuade or dissuade viewers from purchasing a product.

Mr. Bhansali, a You Tuber/V Blogger, has his own channel titled ‘Bearded Chokra’ on youtube.com. He produces and uploads videos wherein he reviews products of various manufacturers. On September 1, 2018, he published a video, ‘Is Parachute Coconut Oil 100% Pure?’

According to Marico, the video is disparaging and denigrating in nature, and it makes claims about Parachute’s edible oil, which are false and unsubstantiated.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Bharati Dangre was hearing a commercial appeal filed by Mr. Bhansali against an order passed by a single Bench of Justice S.J. Kathawalla. The order was passed on January 15 directing Mr. Bhansali to take down/remove and/or block/restrict access to the video.

The Bench on Tuesday said, “The existing law on defamation says no one can make a false statement of a fact. An opinion cannot be held as a fact irrespective of how bad it (opinion) is. Freedom of speech is always put on a higher pedestal than reputation even though both are fundamental rights.”

The court also said, “If society is reposing trust in what they (influencers) say then that trust comes with an obligation. The problem with the internet and social media nowadays is there is so much information that people mistake it for knowledge.”

The court said all parties can put forth what they feel is objectionable about the video and then maybe Mr. Bhansali can remove certain portions from the video. The court directed “the parties to sit across the table and have a discussion” and posted the matter to be heard on February 5. Meanwhile, Marico must not take any action against Mr. Bhansali.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjji5k/article30678590.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMBOMBAYHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-directs-fmcg-company-social-media-influencer-to-discuss-video/article30678585.ece
452,2020/01/29,BMC may scrap Pinjal dam project,"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is not keen on constructing Pinjal dam in Palghar district any more. Considering the extensive delays in building Gargai dam, the civic body is considering scrapping the Pinjal dam project, which is to supply 880 million litres of water daily (MLD) once operational. Instead, the BMC wants to focus on treatment of sewage water for non-potable uses to reduce dependency on potable water.

The city currently gets 3,800 million litres (approximate) of water every day, and engineers expect the demand will increase to 5,940 million litres by 2041. So the State government and the BMC had planned two dams — Gargai (440MLD) and Pinjal — and a river linking project — Damanganga-Pinjal. Other than Gargai and Pinjal, the river link is to add another 1,586 million litres, thus covering the deficit.

But years after the three projects were planned, they continue to remain on paper. The BMC recently informed the standing committee that construction of Gargai dam would cost ₹3,100 crore. The civic body is pushing for this dam and wants to make it functional by 2025. But considering the huge costs, time, permissions required, time taken for land acquisition, and rehabilitation of the affected people, the civic body is not keen on Pinjal dam right now.

“The consensus is, looking at the time taken by Gargai dam itself, we can instead look at harnessing treated waste water under the Mumbai Sewage Disposal Project (MSDP)-II to make up for the deficit. This water can be used for non-potable uses and the potable water can be used to meet the additional demand,” said Shirish Dixit, chief engineer, water supply projects, BMC.

Under MSDP-II, the civic body is supposed to build seven sewage treatment plants in the city. But work on these plants has also been stuck in delays over the years.

However, the BMC will still carry out an environment and social impact assessment of Pinjal dam, based on which it will take a final decision. If Pinjal is scrapped, it raises a question on the river linking project as Pinjal dam is a crucial part of it.

The Damanganga-Pinjal river linking project is to be implemented in association with the Gujarat government. Since these are national projects, the BMC will require State government’s permission to deviate from the original plan.

On Tuesday, Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil held a review meeting on the river linking project.

453,2020/01/29,Pune doctors drain rare cyst from day-old baby’s lung,"A paediatric surgical team in Pune has successfully performed a complex, life-saving surgery on a day-old baby who was detected with a rare cyst in her lungs while still in her mother’s womb.

A team of paediatric surgeons at Motherhood Hospital in Kharadi operated upon baby Ruchika (name changed) in December last year after the child was born with a congenital defect wherein a fluid-filled cyst had been formed in her lung cavity. According to hospital authorities, this kind of cyst occurs only in two or three cases in 1,00,000 live births.

“The baby girl, Ruchika, weighing 2.5 kg was successfully delivered on December 13, 2019. The child was immediately moved to the hospital’s neonatal intensive care unit as she was encountering difficulty in breathing and had to be given continuous positive airway pressure therapy to help her breathe,” said Dr. Tushar Parikh, chief neonatologist at Motherhood Hospital.

Once the baby was stabilised, a lung lobectomy was performed on the second day of birth by paediatric surgeons Dr. Pranav Jadhav and Dr. Kalpesh Patil. “The baby was discharged earlier this month and was in good health,” said Dr. Parikh.

Posing risk to heart

“The cyst in the left side of the lung was hampering the baby’s heart function by compressing it, and may have caused heart failure. The doctors helped the baby breathe freely by initially removing fluid from the cyst that was present in her left lung by an aspiration process and later by performing a lung lobectomy [surgery to remove one of the lobes of the lung] immediately after the first day of her birth,” said Dr. Rajeshwari Pawar, gynaecologist-obstetrician, Motherhood Hospital.

Dr. Pawar said the foetus was diagnosed to have a type 1 congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), which is a developmental defect involving a benign lung lesion that appears before birth as a cyst or mass in the chest. She said, “The cyst is also known as congenital pulmonary airway malformation. The macro cyst present on the left side of the baby’s lung affected the lung tissue, pressed the heart vessels and shifted the heart from its normal position, thereby occupying a lot of space in the chest. This type of CCAM occurs only in say two or three cases in 1,00,000 live births. If left untreated, it would have compromised on the growth of the child’s lung.”

Explaining the complexity of the operation, she said a decision was taken to aspirate the fluid from the cyst using a fine needle by means of a sonographic guided procedure which involved anaesthetising the foetus. “It was a delicate procedure which posed high risk to the life of the baby. However, the procedure was successful and substantial fluid from the cyst was removed. But the cyst recurred and the mother had to be continuously monitored every week by doctors,” said Dr. Pawar.

‘Stayed strong’

Thanking the doctors at Motherhood Hospital for performing the delicate surgery, Shalini (name changed), the baby’s mother, said: “When we came to know about the cyst that was present in the foetus, we were stunned. But we didn’t panic, and stayed strong as it wasn’t advisable for me to be under stress during my pregnancy. After getting discharged, we also went for follow-ups, and the baby is fine now.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/iw6ah2/article30678457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMMotherhood,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pune-doctors-drain-rare-cyst-from-day-old-babys-lung/article30678458.ece
454,2020/01/29,Shiv Bhojan thaali a success in State,"An addition of 500 centres and over one lakh thaalis to the Shiv Bhojan thaali scheme, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s pet project, will require ₹125 crore in funds every year.

On Tuesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and State Minister Chhagan Bhujbal held a video conference with beneficiaries of the scheme in Nandurbar and Kolhapur districts. “The demand for this scheme is increasing by the day. We are committed to expand the scheme for the benefit of the people,” said Mr. Bhujbal.

The pilot project kicked off on January 26 and a total of 24,737 thaalis have been consumed across all districts of the State. On the first day, the number of plates consumed was 11,417; it rose to 13,437 on January 27. The scheme has been launched in all districts, except Yavatmal, where the model code of conduct is in place due to the State Council polls.

According to the officials from the Food, Civil Supplies and the Consumer Protection Department, under which the scheme falls, the demand for the thaalis is gradually increasing.

An official from the department said, “It is estimated that the State would require ₹125 crore annually if we are to add 500 new eateries and one lakh plates. The pilot project has 139 centres and the maximum number of plates served is 17,300 per day. For this, we are spending around ₹6.25 crore for a period of three months.”

The department is also mulling over an option to involve the public in the scheme by inviting voluntary contributions. “We are thinking of opening an option of bringing in citizens, who are willing to donate,” said the official.

Voluntary contributions

As per the plan, people can donate money in memory of their relatives. Religious places like gurudwaras that offer food to devotees can also make donations at the local or State levels.

The official said, “The aim of this scheme is to ensure that cheap and healthy food is served to the needy population. More participation in this initiative is welcome.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ti9hii/article30678391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMSHIVSENABHOJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/shiv-bhojan-thaali-a-success-in-state/article30678392.ece
455,2020/01/29,Jingles and drumbeats,"Walk into the Kalakshetra Grounds this week and you will be greeted by rhythmic parai beats and the reverberating sound of anklets. Artistes energetically perform the temple dances of poikaal kudhirai attam, karagattam and mayil attam, cheered on by an enthusiastic audience.

The first edition of Gramiya Utsav is set to a rousing background score.

Organised by BIG B Entertainment, this village festival aims to bring together the essence and flavours of a village carnival for an urban audience. The format gives visitors a feel of the village life — a window into the cultural heritage of the State.

Beginning from 11 am, the artistes perform every hour, with 30-minute breaks. The last performance is at 7.30 pm.

“We have organised traditional games such as gilli danda, paandi, and also the fun-filled uriyadi,” says Malini Vijayakumar, one of the organisers. Especially played during Pongal, uriyadi involves an earthen pot, hung high up in the air, that contestants have to smash with a bamboo pole, their eyes blindfolded.

Popular with kids in villages, gilli danda is a bat-ball game, while paandi or nondi, is nothing but the regional version of hopscotch, with the players singing folk songs as they play.

Visitors can also shop for textiles, home furnishings, home décor, antiques, garden décor, footwear and jewellery. “The focus is on textiles produced in handlooms of Tamil Nadu, and the goods are directly sold by the manufacturers,” she says.

Crowds throng the kili josiyam and eli josiyam stalls (somewhat similar to tarot card reading, where a trained parrot or rat emerges out of a cage and picks a card) and the kai rekai stall (palm reading). The tiny tots, however, are more desirous of holding the parrot rather than listening to the predictions of soothsayers.

456,2020/01/29,Dhansoo Cafe tries to make relaxed contemporary Indian cuisine,"Amazing. Excellent. These are the two superlative equivalents to dhansoo, a colloquial term in Hindi. And Dhansoo Cafe, a space in the PVR Sangam cinema complex is fun enough, if it didn’t have to live up to that name. However, what confuses us when we find out more about the place is that it is a part of Nueva, originally a South American restaurant owned by Virat Kohli.

Dhansoo Cafe and Nueva are not only connected by a staircase, but the same menu as well — while it retains some South American influence, Dhansoo is being promoted as a space for new-age pan-regional Indian food, the dishes of which are are accessible and homely, yet refreshing and different.

Clearly, Nueva has changed from its original South American brief, but despite the food and pricing remaining the same between the two floors, the staff says the distinction is that Nueva, is the fine dining space, while Dhansoo, is causal. It is the decor that brings out this difference pretty starkly.

The vibe: Dhansoo has seating which is colourful without being overbearing; on a Saturday evening, the space is relaxed without feeling dead. The ambience even included, fittingly, mashups of Bollywood songs with popular American pop.

Do try: The smoky tenderness of the Hyderabadi Patthar Gosht was well complimented by the shocking fresh kachumber, spiced onion, and mint chutney. The meat itself came served on a hot tray of stone. The Japani Samosa was a rather plain, layered puff pastry served with chhole (à la chhole bhature) and one fried green chilli. The pastry itself was plain — but the muted, comforting flavour of dough was heightened by its gently flaky and not-too-crumbly texture.

In the mains, the Norwegian Salmon Pollichatu, came with an interesting interpretation of Venn Pongal (literally, butter Pongal, the savoury sibling of the popular South Indian sweet rice pudding). Pollichatu is usually a gravied curried with fish or prawns: in this dish, the chunk of salmon was doused in a tangy tomato and onion gravy, and came wrapped in a banana leaf.

Purists might turn up their noses at Dhansoo’s interpretation of the Pongal, but the buttery coconut milk sauce blended into short grain rice, and topped off with a mustard seed and curry leaf tadka worked well with the salmon.

The Kulfa, which is a delicate kulfi with falooda with sabja seeds sprinkled on top, is a delight for those who don’t like their desserts too sweet.

Their Boodi Laddoo Ice Cream, with the texture and form of the rich mithai, felt like it was almost blended with rabri-like ice cream before being balled into shape.

This dish probably captures exactly what Dhansoo does in making daily Indian food a little fun — not “contemporary” like fine-dining restaurants like Indian Accent or Rooh use it, but not also “fusion”, which can feel like forced experimentation.

Skip: The infused Piscos on the cocktail menu were okay on their own, but if you’ve had the slightly yellow to clear Chilean/Peruvian liquor in a more basic form you’d prefer its freshness; it’s a drink that that gin-lovers can easily take to, and one that mixes well with cola, to make the homely Piscola cocktail with a zesty squeeze of lemon. But weighed down with flavour, these weren’t meant for much of the already-rich food on the menu.

In the desserts section, the Khubani Mishti Doi came with a dollop of apricot jam, a disc of caramelised honey and dry fruit, one shahi tukda, and a pot of mishti doi. The doi’s texture felt more like shrikhand, and the Khubani itself, which is a sweet made of dried apricots, didn’t really taste like anything.

Go with: Anyone who isn’t picky or fussy about their food.

459,2020/01/29,When in doubt about buying a vehicle,"Pick the Seltos

Gaurav Pal, New Delhi: Which mid-size SUV should I buy with a budget of around ₹15 lakh? BS-IV models currently have lucrative discounts, especially the Nissan Kicks, while the Kia Seltos already has a BS-VI option. Should I buy the top-spec Nissan Kicks XV pre-diesel for around ₹15 lakh (on-road), or should I opt for the Kia Seltos diesel-manual at that price point?

The Kicks has some great discounts and is better value than before, but, quite frankly, it can’t hold a candle to the Seltos — a model that is far superior in most respects and the one we would whole-heartedly recommend. The only area where the Kicks scores over the Seltos is on bad roads. The beefy suspension and chassis of the Kicks can take a lot of beating but that is not reason enough to choose it over the Seltos.

Bet on the City

Sourjo Rai Chowdhury, via email: Is the Toyota Yaris still a good sedan for driving for five to six years, or should I wait for the new Honda City?

The Yaris is undoubtedly a good car, offering a stress-free driving experience and long-term peace of mind, like most Toyotas. However, it misses out on the wow factor and the back seat isn’t as spacious or comfortable as the Honda City’s. Now, the all-new Honda City is expected before April 2020 and would be a better bet as it will be a big step ahead of the Yaris.

The better car

With a budget of ₹13 lakh, which one would you suggest I go for between the Hyundai Venue SX+ DCT (with auto gearbox, sunroof, and good mileage) and the Kia Seltos HTK+, which is bigger and has a BS-VI engine?

The choice between the Venue and the Seltos boils down to the space you need. If you are driving alone or with just one other passenger, and you don’t have much use for the backseat, the fully-loaded Venue is a better option than the mid-spec Seltos HTK+. Also, the Venue is more compact and easier to manoeuvre and park. However, if you need space then the Seltos is the one to go for.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/uehwll/article30683014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bgmkiaseltos-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/when-in-doubt-about-vehicles/article30683015.ece
460,2020/01/29,New Suzuki Access 125 review: An upgrade for the better,"The Access 125 was one of Suzuki’s first products in our country when it entered our market as a stand-alone company nearly 13 years ago. Since then, the Access has become quite a popular option in the scooter segment and also accounts for over a third of the manufacturer’s two-wheeler sales. We got to ride the new BS-VI-compliant iteration and here is what it is like.

What’s new?

Most notably, the engine. The stricter emission norms that the 124cc single-cylinder engine will soon have to comply with have resulted in the switch from the use of a carburettor to fuel injection. How has this affected its performance? Peak power output remains identical, at 8.7hp, but now comes in 250rpm earlier, at 6,750rpm. The peak torque, meanwhile, has reduced minimally, from 10.2Nm to 10Nm. Despite this, and an additional 2 kilogram increase in weight, the Access is still quick, outpacing the new Activa 125 by nearly 7sec in a sprint to 80kph.

Suzuki has used the opportunity to also equip the scooter with a few additional features. For starters, the fuel filler has moved out of the underseat storage and onto the rear of the scooter. But it can’t be operated remotely and requires you to manually open it with the key, partially defeating the purpose of having it there in the first place. It would have also been a lot easier if the cap clicked itself into place and didn’t have to be locked back.

Changes have also been made to the instrument console. Though the layout remains the same, the small digital section now displays battery voltage level and indicates when a service is due. A more noticeable change is the addition of what Suzuki calls ‘Eco Assist Lights’, which go from green to light blue to very blue, depending on throttle input. They are an interesting addition, but they come across as tacky, especially because of how much they contrast with all the other relatively subtle colour schemes and textures the scooter uses. Speaking of lights, the headlight is now powered by an LED, but it illuminates only just as much (and as well) as the previous halogen-powered unit. Also new is an easy-start system that essentially requires you to press the ignition switch only once, with the scooter cranking itself and taking care of the rest.

Lastly, Suzuki reduced the fuel tank size by 0.6 litres, but only so we could benefit from more underseat storage space — 21.8 litres of which make it the largest of any 100-125cc scooter in India. The seat and footboard have been extended on this iteration as well, and the latter, again, is the largest of any 100-125cc scooter here! The Access 125 Special Edition also gets a USB charging port as standard.

The features list on the new Access isn’t as technologically impressive as the one the new Activa 125 gets, but the updates do aid the practicality of the scooter to a greater extent.

What stays the same?

Nearly everything else. If not for the changes to the headlight or external fuel filler cap, you’d be hard-pressed to differentiate between this new Access 125 and the older model. Just like with the outgoing BS-IV model, the SE you see in these images gets matte-finish paint with a contrasting beige seat, chrome bezels and round chrome mirrors — as opposed to the conventional black plastic ones on the regular Access. Black alloys, too, are standard, but only on the Special Edition. Overall, the Access looks quite conventional and is among the least dramatic scooters in the 125cc space.

Specifications Engine: 124cc, single-cylinder, fuel-injected

Power: 8.7hp at 6750rpm

Torque: 10Nm at 5500rpm

Kerb weight: 103kg

Wheelbase: 1265mm

Ground clearance: 160mm

Seat height: 773mm

Fuel tank: 5 litres

Suspension (f/r): Telescopic fork/Monoshock

Tyres (f/r): 90/90 - 12 / 90/100 - 10

The suspension and brakes continue unchanged as well. Over potholes and consistently bad patches of tarmac, the Access’ ride is impressive. It is also quite relaxed, ergonomically, and in terms of the riding experience. At speed, we also found it to be more stable than the Activa 125.

Verdict

29bgmwheelsqanda

. This special-edition, disc brake and alloy wheel-equipped version costs ₹6,000 more than the BS-IV version in the same spec and that is one of the lowest hikes we’ve witnessed on a BS-VI model yet.

461,2020/01/29,Tata Nexon EV review: All powered up,"The Nexon EV is Tata’s second attempt at an all-electric vehicle after the Tigor EV. While the latter was developed with a focus on commercial markets, the Nexon EV is squarely targeted at private individuals.

Styling is in-line with the Nexon facelift, with new projector headlamps with LED DRLs, a new grille, a new bumper, and a flatter bonnet to meet the upcoming pedestrian crash safety norms. The new 16-inch alloys are lighter at each corner by almost a kilo. The tail-lamps get revised LED elements, and the bumpers feature some styling tweaks. Completing the EV’s look are blue highlights and tri-arrow design elements across the exteriors.

Inside, there are few changes to the dashboard aside from the blue highlights. The steering is new, and the instrument cluster is now part-digital, with a coloured display showcasing information related to battery charge, drive mode, range etc. There is a new rotary ‘gear’ selector too. However, it isn’t the most convenient to use, as it is slow to respond and illegible in direct sunlight, which means you have to rely on the instrument panel to see the mode you are in. The seats and space on offer remain unchanged from the regular Nexon; so these are as comfortable as before, with a good amount of support, and well-judged cushioning.

Tata has equipped the entire EV range with its latest ZConnect eSIM-based connectivity, that gets 35 features for remote commands, as well as location-based and security services, among others.

Powering the EV is a permanent magnet motor putting out 129hp and 245Nm of torque, drawing power from a 30.2kWh under-floor battery pack. This EV’s ARAI-certified range is 312km.

Tata claims a charge time of 60 minutes for an 80 percent charge using a DC fast charger, and an eight-hour charge (20-100 percent) time using the 15A charger provided with the car.

The battery pack conforms to the IP67 standard of protection, and also has an AIS 48 rating; which means that this EV is likely to easily sail through flooded roads, switch off automatically if trapped underwater, and even take the regular abuse of our road conditions throughout its lifespan.

Initial impressions of the powertrain are very good. Just as you’d expect from an electric vehicle, a tap on the accelerator delivers an immediate corresponding response; though power doesn’t flow in a big unregulated rush, but in a wonderfully linear manner, allowing for smooth progress in urban driving conditions. Even darting into traffic gaps feels effortless, as there is more than enough surge for daily usage. Performance, however, flattens out the harder you press on the throttle, and as speed builds.

Switch to ‘S’ and the EV feels a lot more aggressive. Responses are much stronger, but aren’t as well measured, as the front wheels often struggle for traction when you stomp on the accelerator, especially on winding sections of road. In ‘S’, the car continues to run on or accelerate for a second or so even after you’ve lifted off the throttle, which is a bit disconcerting; but performance is strong. Our testing equipment showed a 0-100kph acceleration time of just 9.64sec in ‘S’, whereas, in ‘D’, it took 13.75sec. Flat out, the Nexon EV will max out at 120kph.

There is a bit of a learning curve for those transitioning to this EV from conventional internal combustion cars. The car never coasts; instead, it decelerates the moment you lift-off. This regeneration function uses the car’s momentum to recharge its battery; but this feature is not adjustable.

Furthermore, despite the hill-start assist, the car rolls back a foot or more on an incline before setting off, which can be a bit disconcerting. The hill-descent control holds the car’s speed at around 20kph while driving down a slope, but it isn’t the configurable crawl function seen in standard SUVs paired to their ESP systems.

Moving to the ride, the suspension has been tweaked to accommodate the car’s additional weight, so the ride is a bit firmer at lower speeds. It is also busier over broken sections, with large potholes registering with a harder thump. Up the speed, however, and it comfortably rounds off the bumps and road imperfections.

Handling is sharp and well-balanced, and in combination with the SUV’s low centre of gravity — thanks to the under-floor battery pack — makes direction changes quick and fun. The tight body control and superbly calibrated brakes only load you up on confidence.

The Nexon EV works superbly as a city car. It is quick off the mark, effortless to drive and feels so familiar to ICE cars, most drivers will be happy to swap. The S mode will appeal to those looking for bursts of performance with strong brakes and tidy handling to make it fun-to-drive as well. Then there is the comfortable cabin, and kit like connected car tech, a sunroof and auto lights and wipers; so there is plenty to get excited about here.

A lot, however, depends on driving range in the real world. Despite the ARAI figure of 312km, real-world range is likely to be around 180-220km, depending on the driving style; only just about enough.

Tata has priced the Nexon EV at ₹13.99 lakh for the entry-level XM variant and at ₹15.99 lakh for the top-spec Nexon EV XZ+ LUX (ex-showroom, pan-India). This means that the base EV costs ₹1.29 lakh more than the most expensive diesel-automatic version of the Nexon facelift. Also, don’t forget the ₹4-6 per kilometre or so you are likely to save on running costs, and the warranty on the electric motor and battery pack.

Those of you looking for a more definitive verdict will have to wait for some more time for a detailed road test, where real-world range is not an unknown factor. One thing is for sure, the Nexon EV is clearly one of the most promising electric vehicles to go on sale yet.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/sc0vj0/article30682650.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bgmtatanexonev2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/all-powered-up-the-nexon-ev/article30682654.ece
462,2020/01/29,Let’s take a moment,"So, I learned something new this week! Ha! I know what you’re thinking: ‘Was Bug Boy abducted by aliens and did he have an out of body experience and is THAT how he learnt something new — actually learnt something?’ Well, if you’re thinking that, that means you’re either a) my Pesky Brother or b) you share a lot in common with my PB. If it’s a) then buzz off PB and if it’s b) then… well, I’m sorry for you.

So, the new thing I learned this week is that there’s something called Martyrs’ Day that is celebrated on January 30. Okay, celebrated is the wrong word. Observed would be more appropriate, because Martyrs’ Day is the day Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by Nathuram Godse. He assassinated Gandhiji at a place called Birla House in Delhi because he didn’t believe in Bapu’s ideas and plans for India. I can’t figure out why people don’t just try to talk things out instead of picking up a weapon. But then, that’s grownups for you: they’ll tell us kids to behave a certain way and then go ahead and do the exact opposite.

In remembrance

At first, I thought the whole idea was really — well, depressing. We usually remember birthdays, days of achievement and success. It was the first time I’d heard of a day that was for remembering when someone was killed. It just seemed so sad.

So, I decided that I should read up about Martyrs’ Day and the first thing I did was look up the meaning of the word martyr. A martyr is ‘a person who is killed because of their religious or other beliefs’. So, since Gandhiji was killed because of his political beliefs, he’s a martyr.

January 30 is called Shaheed Diwas in India and we don’t just remember Gandhiji, but also everyone who lost their life by fighting for India’s freedom, and all the soldiers who have died in service of the nation. We take two minutes of our time — which is not a lot considering how much we have to be thankful to these people for — and remember them. Wherever we are: at school, at work or at home, at 11 a.m. we stop what we’re doing and remember these heroes. And it’s not just in India; across the world, 27 countries have a Martyrs’ Day.

While I think it’s amazing that we have a day to honour people who have fought for what they believe in, I also think it’s super sad for the exact same reason: that sometimes people die because they believed in a particular idea or cause. I wish we didn’t have to have a Martyrs’ Day at all. That people learnt to accept opinions and ideas that don’t match their own.

If you ask me, I don’t think we should wait till we’re grown up to learn this, we should start today. Right now. I think that’s what Bapu would have wanted.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/msocju/article30683817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31ytbugboyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/lets-take-a-moment/article30683818.ece
463,2020/01/29,HomecomingSaving the farm,"The story so far:The kids have become fond of Sundari, the hen.

“Let’s just sell the cows,” said Appa throwing his hands up. Appa and Amma had been sitting with bills all morning and arguing.

“What?” said the kids.

“It’s too much work. It’s simpler to buy milk in packets,” Appa tried to reason.

Ajji coughed. “But wasn’t that the point of coming back to Singahalli? You said life had become too artificial in England.”

“That is true. But you still need money to run things,” said Appa dejected. “The farm is not doing that well. The hospital is difficult to manage.”

Ajji said, “This is how life in a village is. There will always be uncertainties. We managed. We raised you all here. If it’s not what you imagined, maybe you should think of going back.”

“It’s not just the cows. We’ve put in a lot of money into the hospital. I am scared,” said Appa.

Akash had never seen his parents this way. He thought his parents knew all the answers — that they were never scared.

He spoke up, “Everything good is a lot of work, Appa. You told me that. This is our family. We can’t sell the cows.”

“Look at the work you have done. People are happy to have a hospital here. They don’t have to travel for treatment. The children have started a school. The farm gives us fruits and vegetables. You have to be patient. Things will turn around,” said Ajji.

“I agree,” said Amma. “Ever since we got here, it’s been crazy. Some days are awful, some days are great. But what a year it’s been! This is home.”

Friends for life

Rudra who was listening said, “Akash is my best friend. I don’t want him to leave. I know I made his life miserable. But that is because I thought he will steal Ajji from me. You have to stay,” he said. Akash was too stunned to speak. He gave Rudra a smile.

Dharti brought her savings. “Here Appa, take this,” she said. “You can have my money.”

“Now let’s not talk of leaving or selling the cows. Besides, if you sell the cows, Sundari-the hen will get angry and peck us all to death!”

Everyone laughed. Sundari was looking in and seemed very angry.

“Okay we are staying. This is definitely our home and our life. Whatever happens, we will face it together,” said Appa.

“Yay!” said everyone.

473,2020/01/29,Budding artists give a makeover to public spaces in Thanjavur,"Students of Government Fine Arts College, Kumbakonam have been commissioned to paint a 300-metre stretch of the Government Raja Mirasudhar Hospital highlighting Tamil history and culture by the Thanjavur Municipal Corporation.

The effort has been undertaken ahead of the Kumbabhishekam of the Thanjavur Big Temple.

Tourists and visitors travelling to Thanjavur alight at the New Bus Stand and usually walk down the 300-metre stretch to the Big Temple. “The walls are usually covered with film or political posters. As the Kumbabhishekam approaches, we decided to add to the aesthetic experience,” said a senior official of the civic body.

The walls have been divided into 142 panels measuring 8 feet by 6 feet. The 142 panels have been further divided into five themes. “We began discussing the project in October and work on research and ideation began immediately,” said Radha Parthasarathy, senior lecturer, Department of Painting, Government Fine Arts College, Kumbakonam.

The first part traces the history of Tamil Nadu, and includes portraits of Tamil poets such as Thiruvalluvar, Bharathiar and Tholkappiar. The second part depicts the 108 Shiva Thandavams or karnams of Bharathanatyam. “There are sculptures of the Karnams in the temple but they are difficult to access and some of them have become worn over time. Tourists and devotees can take a better look at them on these walls,” she said.

The third part is images of traditional Tamil food items such as kozhukattai and kanji.The fourth section shows traditional games such as hopscotch, marbles, etc. The civic body has taken over 10 panels to pictorially depict Swacch Bharat, rainwater harvesting and other schemes.

A total of 120 students are currently on the field and a large part of the paintings have been completed. Sponsors have been roped in to purchase advertising space under each frame. “We have fixed the cost at ₹7,500 per frame. Educational institutions, government and private banks have purchased them. The amount is being directly transferred to the students for their use,” the Corporation official said.

Acting on a tip-off a team of ChildLine volunteers, led by M. Kulanthaivelu, Director, Childline Sub Centre, Tirumayam, visited Periyakalluvayal in Thulayanur panchayat and conducted enquiries with various residents, sources said. Based on information provided by a villager, the volunteers conducted an enquiry with Kadappan,55, and his wife Selvi, 50. Though they refused to cooperate, the couple later told them that a Tiruchi-based Muslim couple “adopted” their son. Soon after the enquiry, the couple escaped from the village.

However, with the ChildLine team pursuing the case vigorously, Kadappan produced the boy before the the team in Pudukottai. As per standard procedure, the boy was produced before the Child Welfare Committee along with his parents.

479,2020/01/29,Another traffic bottleneck adds to road woes,"The Karur Bypass Road-Tiruchi-Karur Highway intersection near Kalaignar Arivalayam in the city is fast emerging as the latest traffic bottleneck if the frequent traffic snarls are any indication.

The establishment of a temporary bus halt for mofussil buses on Karur route immediately after the descent of the road overbridge on Karur Bypass Road has also compounded the woes of motorists as often the bus crew halt their vehicles haphazardly, blocking traffic coming behind.

In the recent years, Karur Bypass Road, connecting Salai Road and Tiruchi-Karur Highway, has emerged as one of the arterial roads in the city. It has also emerged as an important entry route for vehicles coming from the northern and western districts of the State. Mofussil buses and other vehicles from these districts enter the city via this road to go via Anna Nagar Link Road to reach Central Bus Stand.

A majority of motorists also prefer the road to reach Thillai Nagar from Chathram Bus Stand instead of going via the heavily congested Main Guard Gate area. Heavy vehicles heading towards Chennai and Karur highways also use the road to exit the city.

Already, the other end of the road — the Salai Road intersection — has been witnessing heavy traffic pile-ups almost right through the day. Now the other end of the road is also witnessing log jams, much to the exasperation of road users.

During peak hours, traffic pile ups extend right over the road over bridge on the Karur Bypass Road and almost up to Kamarajar Statue near Chathram Bus Stand.

The situation turns worse on suba muhurtham days as a few marriage halls are located around the road intersection.

An automatic traffic signal installed several years ago remains defunct.

A lone traffic cop posted at the intersection often struggles to clear the vehicles converging from three directions at the spot.

“We experience a torrid time during the peak hours on both ends of the road. Often vehicles transporting school and college students are delayed due to the hold ups here,” observed Ravi, an autorickshaw driver, who was caught in a traffic hold-up on the bridge on Monday.

Several motorists are critical of the police for locating the temporary bus halt for moffusil buses right at the descent of the bridge. The temporary halt was established following the closure of Chathram Bus Stand for redevelopment under the Smart City Mission.

“The bus halt is also situated in unhygienic and insecure surroundings. A proper bus halt should be established. It only betrays the poor planning by authorities,” said N. Ramakrishnan, founder, MGR Nalpani Mandram.

Motorists feel that the bus halt can be located some distance away on Tiruchi-Karur Highway so that movement of other vehicles are not obstructed whenever a mofussil bus halts there.

They also demand that more traffic cops be posted to regulate the traffic at this intersection and also near Chinthamani round about. Bumper-to-bumper traffic is a common sight between Cauvery bridge signal and Chinthamani Anna Statue.

Motorists have also been repeatedly highlighting the problem faced at Salai Road intersection. Often they get their turn to cross over the intersection only in third round of green signal.

The poor condition of the road on the extreme left side while approaching the intersection from Karur Bypass Road also makes it difficult for vehicles to negotiate the approach towards the signal.

“Police should take effective steps to streamline traffic at this intersection rather than just making announcements on a public address system,” said Gopalakrishnan, a regular commuter.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/kkum57/article30680771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY29-KARURBYPASSROADTRAFFICSNARLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/another-traffic-bottleneck-adds-to-road-woes/article30680776.ece

482,2020/01/29,Tributes paid to former SIT Principal,"The Seshasayee Institute of Technology (SIT) celebrated the birth centenary of its former principal G. Sundaram at its annual day programme here on Tuesday.

Sundaram, a Highways Department engineer who was deputed to SIT, served as its principal from 1962 to 1969 with a further extension until 1974. He established NGO, Tiruchi Productivity Council, and later served as its treasurer.

Born on January 22, 1919 in Tiruchi, Sundaram, studied B.A. in National College, followed by a B.E. from the College of Engineering, Guindy, then University of Madras.

As principal, and, after retirement, as secretary, he played a big role in building the careers of hundreds of engineering students.

Sundaram was also associated with several other local educational institutions such as Srirangam High School, Seva Sangam School and E.R. Higher Secondary School.

He was honoured as one of The Hindu’s oldest readers in Tiruchi region at a citizen’s forum organised to celebrate the newspaper’s 125th anniversary in 2003. He passed away on September 4, 2005.

486,2020/01/29,Block-level teachers’ meetings under way in Tiruchi district,"The School Education Department is in the process of convening meetings of primary and upper primary teachers at the block level in the district to orient teachers about the government’s instruction to achieve cent percent results in the public exams for levels V and VIII.

On their part, the teachers say they are in a state of confusion after the government made it clear that the entire year’s portions will be covered for testing for the public exams, which implies scrapping of the trimester system introduced from 2012-13, with the idea of reducing the academic burden on students.

The trimester system with three terms in a year under which portions completed in one term are not carried forward to successive terms was welcomed by parents and teachers alike.

Primary and upper primary teachers of schools in Tiruchi district say it is unfair on the part of the State government to discontinue the trimester system all of a sudden since the announcement on the public exam was made during the course of the second term of the trimester.

The government order issued at the time of introduction of the trimester system said: “The rationale for introducing the trimester system is to create a school where teaching and learning is valued with an emphasis on learning outcomes demonstrated in students’ performance. A well-designed curriculum through thinner books along with creative instructional practices will form the key to success.”

According to a senior teacher, it will be difficult to expect the children to retain the textbooks pertaining to the first and second terms of the trimester.

“At this point, there is time only to complete the portions of the third term and conduct revision. The scope for brushing through the portions of the earlier term does not exist at all,” a school head added.

The school heads are not prepared to take at face value assurances by officials that the public exam is only an assessment exercise. The government is believed to have taken the stand of preparing students for the public exam from a young age to equip them for NEET and other competitive exams.

But for that to happen, the paraphernalia has to be strengthened. The infrastructure in schools should be strengthened and the staff strength must be augmented to create the foundation right from pre-primary level, the teachers say.

“In the emerging circumstance, there is bound to be a number of failures if objective valuation is undertaken. But then, we are also required to toe the government policy of not detaining students. The contradiction only makes our predicament worse,” another school head said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/block-level-teachers-meetings-under-way-in-tiruchi-district/article30680585.ece

Speaking to reporters here after inspecting passenger amenities at Karur railway junction, he said the Centre had allotted funds for carrying out the survey. Preliminary steps had been taken to initiate the survey, which would begin soon.

To a question, Mr. Thomas said there were no possibility of extending Salem-Chennai express trains up to Karur as they were invariably running to their full capacity. However, Southern Railway would consider a plea for operating a day-time train between Chennai and Karur.

When his attention was drawn on the absence of toilets in Diesel-Electric Multiple Unit (DEMU) trains, he said the concern was genuine. Coaches with toilets would be added when replacing the existing coaches.

495,2020/01/29,SAD to support BJP in Delhi Assembly polls,"The BJP and its oldest ally, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), seemed to have made up on Wednesday. BJP president J.P. Nadda went over to SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal’s residence here for what was a patch-up meeting after the two parties fell out over the seat-sharing for the Delhi Assembly election.

Addressing a press conference with Mr. Badal, Mr. Nadda said: “One of the oldest constituents of the BJP-led NDA, the SAD has always been at the forefront of serving society. A strong coalition between the BJP and the SAD will remain intact.” He also thanked the SAD for deciding to support the BJP in Delhi, though its sitting MLA Manjinder Sirsa had been denied ticket.

The SAD had supported the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Parliament, but has consistently been stating — both in the House and outside — that the Muslims should be added to the list of communities under the Act.

When talks broke down between the BJP and the SAD over seat-sharing, Mr. Sirsa alleged that this was one of the reasons for the pact being broken.

Backing for CAA

At the press conference, Mr. Badal, however, clarified: “We never broke our alliance with the BJP. We were just considering the possibility of contesting separately. We have supported the CAA from the beginning and have consistently raised the issue of persecuted Sikhs in Pakistan and Afghanistan with the NDA government.”

The SAD had been given three seats in Delhi in the last three elections, but was kept out of the alliance this time, with the Janata Dal (United) getting two seats and the Lok Janshakti Party one.

According to sources, senior leaders of both parties, including Rajya Sabha members Naresh Gujral of the SAD and Bhupendra Yadav of the BJP, worked behind the scenes for the patch-up. “The fact is that Mr. Badal and the SAD are now the moderates in Punjab, and looking at the Congress government, it is necessary that the NDA alliance remain strong in the State. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has already flirted with extremist elements to gain political traction. So, the BJP and the Akalis could not part ways and yield space to such political forces that may even usher in extremist elements,” a senior NDA leader said.

“The BJP-SAD alliance was created to keep extremist elements out and panthic [Sikh orthodox] forces and the Hindu community together after the harsh years of extremism. It is necessary that this alliance continue for the sake of Punjab,” the source said.

In a significant move, therefore, it was Mr. Nadda who went over to Mr. Badal’s residence, despite the SAD being a smaller party, to soothe tempers.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2bc4dg/article30686519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30TH-NADDA,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/sad-to-support-bjp-in-delhi-assembly-polls/article30686520.ece

The AAP, in its complaint to the EC, also said BJP MPs — Gautam Gambhir, Parvesh Verma and Hans Raj Hans — made “false and fabricated” videos to put out a wrong picture of Delhi government schools to the people.

497,2020/01/29,"ECI orders removal of Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma from BJP star campaigners list","The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Wednesday ordered the removal of Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur and BJP MP from West Delhi Parvesh Verma from the BJP’s list of star campaigners for the Delhi Assembly elections after prima facie finding that recent statements made by them were in violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC).

In a statement, the ECI said: “Election Commission has ordered the removal of Sh. Anurag Thakur and Sh. Parvesh Sahib Singh from the list of star campaigners of Bhartiya Janta Party for the general elections to the Legislative Assembly of the NCT of Delhi with immediate effect and until further orders (sic).”

The two leaders would still be allowed to campaign but the expenses incurred on their campaigning would be counted in the expenditure by the candidate concerned. The expenditure of star campaigners, a list of which is submitted to the ECI ahead of elections, while campaigning are not counted as a part of the candidate’s expenses and are borne by the political party.

The ECI also issued a notice to Mr. Verma on Wednesday for his comments to a news agency and a speech in Vikaspuri where he made comments with the “potential of disturbing harmony and aggravating the existing difference between social and religious communities”. Mr. Verma had told the news agency, ANI, that people “there” (Shaheen Bagh) would “enter your homes and rape your sisters and daughters”.

Mr. Thakur was issued a notice by the ECI on Tuesday evening for participating in chants of “desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro salo ko” at a rally in Rithala.

In the notices, the ECI said it found the statements made by the leaders to be prima facie in violation of the MCC and gave them till 12 noon on Thursday to give their replies. According to ECI officials, removing the two leaders from the list of star campaigners was an interim action. The Commission would take a call on the cases after receiving responses from Mr. Thakur and Mr. Verma.

Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, who is also the BJP’s in-charge for Delhi elections, said the party would study the ECI’s order before taking any action.

“I have just got information that the Election Commission has issued some directions. We will study and if necessary present a letter and application. But more importantly, the BJP is putting up a balanced campaign with positivity,” he said, in response to a question about the ECI’s order during a press conference to announce the Cabinet’s decisions on Wednesday.

The ECI wrote to all recognised parties on Wednesday, reiterating instructions under the MCC. It said there had been “several instances of undesirable public utterances” in violation of the Code in the Delhi elections so far.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hvfotd/article30674944.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDEXPARVESHVERMAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/eci-orders-removal-of-anurag-thakur-parvesh-verma-from-bjp-star-campaigners-list/article30684034.ece

Founded in 2003, her jewellery label is not new to Chennai, as she has participated in multiple exhibitions before and is familiar with what the city wants. “They are conscious shoppers, who look for quality and are fascinated by diamonds, and I have taken into consideration all these aspects when creating a special line for this show,” says Archana.

She will be launching her Guttapusalu collection in many different patterns, with gold, uncut diamonds, polki and diamonds. “A South Indian bride adorns herself with Kanjeevaram. I have designed jewellery to suit the taste of the brides of Tamil Nadu for this show.

499,2020/01/29,Pardon the challenge,"If you are watching and admiring celebrities jumping onto the #DollyPartonChallenge, don’t miss the challenge taken up by pet owners, especially of cats and dogs. The Dolly Parton challenge went viral last week when country singer Dolly Parton posted a photo compilation of four ‘versions’ of herself to her Instagram account on her 74th birthday on January 19.

The compilation included her LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Tinder look. Her Instagram post went with a caption ‘Get you a woman who can do it all’. The LinkedIn Dolly looked super profesh in a fitted, checked blazer, while Tinder Dolly was dressed up in a super-sexy Playboy costume. The challenge became viral with celebrities Kerry Washington, Ellen DeGeneres, Will Smith joining for fun. Sylvester Stallone and Arnold too posted compilations of their photos.At the time of writing this, the trending hashtag brings up around 83,000 posts on Instagram alone; and the challenge has also migrated to Facebook, Reddit and Twitter.

Then, just as the challenge was fading out, dog lovers jumped in with their own version, posting photos of their pets with four different looks. For LinkedIn, the photos being shared tend to be more professional and business-like. For Facebook, the images are more family-friendly and upbeat. The Instagram images are posed, highly styled, and bright. The Tinder images are the most hysterical, being flirty and representing dogs looking for love. Among the compilations posted by pet owners, it is the Tinder look that makes most followers go ‘Awwww.’",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/pce5hw/article30681607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/dolly4,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/dollypartonchallenge/article30681608.ece
500,2020/01/29,China coronavirus: WHO chief calls new emergency talks,"The head of the World Health Organisation on January 29 called a new emergency meeting of experts to discuss whether the SARS-like virus outbreak that began in China constitutes an international health emergency.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who visited China this week and held talks with President Xi Jinping, said the meeting was needed because of cases of onward transmission of the virus outside of China.

“I have decided to reconvene the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on the new #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) tomorrow (January 30),” Dr. Tedros said on Twitter.

Dr. Tedros said most people who contract the virus exhibit “milder symptoms” but about one in five have severe illness, including pneumonia and respiratory failure.

Since it was first identified on December 31, the virus has killed 132 people and spread to more than a dozen countries since emerging in the Chinese city of Wuhan.

Germany and Japan have both reported cases of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus in their countries.

The WHO's Emergency Committee met for two days last week but stopped short of calling an international health emergency, saying that more information was needed about the virus.

The designation is reserved for the worst outbreaks and has only been used five times before by the Geneva-based U.N. health agency, including for Ebola and swine flu.

“The world is pulling together to end the outbreak, building on lessons learned from past outbreaks,” Dr. Tedros said.

“China needs the world's solidarity and support,” he said, adding that he had held “frank talks” with Mr. Xi.

Dr. Tedros also said the WHO “deeply regrets” a mistake in three of its reports last week in which it referred to the global risk of the outbreak as “moderate” instead of “high”.

The virus bears similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which also originated in China and killed more than 770 people worldwide in 2002 and 2003.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/dimusb/article30686840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tedros-Adhanom-Ghebreyesus,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/china-coronavirus-who-chief-calls-new-emergency-talks/article30686659.ece
501,2020/01/29,AYUSH recommends Unani medicines for ‘symptomatic management of coronavirus infection’,"Nearly four weeks after China first reported the presence of a novel coronavirus in a cluster of 41 patients in the city of Wuhan to the World Health Organisation (WHO), modern medicine has not yet found a particular drug to treat and cure the infection.

People infected with the novel virus are currently provided only symptomatic treatment, including ensuring they get enough oxygen, and the use of a ventilator to push air into the lungs, if necessary, to allow patients to survive long enough for the immune system to fight the disease.

Unani medicines

But the AYUSH Ministry has sent out a press release listing specific Unani medicines “useful in symptomatic management of coronavirus infection”. The release does not mention the symptoms that people infected with coronavirus exhibit, nor which medicine should be taken for managing what specific symptom.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, coronavirus symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The illness also causes lung lesions and pneumonia. Milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult. According to The New York Times, “Chinese authorities have said they had seen cases that did not meet the usual description. In these patients, the first symptoms were gastrointestinal, including diarrhoea.”

On Ayurveda

In the case of Ayurveda, a couple of medicines have been recommended by the AYUSH Ministry as “prophylactic measures/ immunomodulatory drugs as per the Ayurvedic practices”. In this, the release does clearly mention: “Advocacy is for information only and shall be adopted in consultation with registered Ayurveda practitioners only”. Such a cautionary note has not been provided in the case of Unani drugs.

On Homoeopathy

In the case of Homoeopathy, the release states: “The Group of Experts inter-alia has recommended that homoeopathy medicine Arsenicum album30 could betaken as prophylactic medicine against coronavirus infections, which has also been advised for prevention of ILI [influenza-like illness]. It has recommended one doze of Arsenicum album 30, daily in empty stomach for three days. The dose should be repeated after one month by following the same schedule in case coronavirus infections prevail in the community.”

The advice on Homoeopathy is based on the recommendation of the Scientific Advisory Board that met on January 28 at the instance of Ministry of AYUSH to “discuss the way and means of prevention of coronavirus infection through Homoeopathy”.

The release includes standard precautions to avoid infections — washing hands with soap; avoiding contact to eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoiding close contact with people who are sick; and wearing a mask.

Microbial causation

“Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani do not believe in microbial causation of disease, unlike Homoeopathy. In traditional systems of medicine, there is no need for disease diagnosis before disease treatment,” said retired virologist Dr. Jacob John.

Dr. Bhavana Prasher, an Ayurveda doctor from the Delhi-based CSIR (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research)-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR-IGIB) counters Professsor John. She said: “Ayurveda does consider external triggers, including microbes. But it does not look at individual microbes. The strategy of management is to boost a person’s immune system and allow it to fight the disease.”

Professor John said that while modern medicine demands evidence through clinical trials, traditional medicine goes by an expert’s teaching that in turn goes by dogma.

Genome sequence

After Chinese researchers first shared the whole genome sequence of the novel coronavirus, a few teams located in other countries have also posted the sequence. It was based on the genome sequence that Chinese researchers could tell the novel virus belongs to the coronavirus family. Preliminary results from the whole genome sequencing show that this novel coronavirus has similarities with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus.

Apart from these basic details, not much is known about the virus in terms of its source, precise duration of incubation, severity, and what makes it quite easily transmissible. Most reported cases have been mild, with about 20% of patients experiencing severe disease, the WHO has said.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/news/owl87/article30684766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Ayush-Ministry,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/ayush-recommends-unani-medicines-for-symptomatic-management-of-coronavirus-infection/article30684502.ece
502,2020/01/29,Dr P Raghuram talks about his new responsibilities as president of Association of Surgeons of India,"The year 2020 began with added responsibilities for Dr P Raghuram. One of the youngest in 82 years history of Asia Pacific’s largest surgical organisation to be elected to the apex position as the president of Association of Surgeons of India (ASI), he feels his responsibility towards the medical fraternity has grown.

Explaining about ASI, Dr Raghuram, who is a Pamda Shri awardee and Dr B C Roy National awardee, says, “The Association of Surgeons of India (ASI) was established in 1938 to realise a long standing wish among the surgeons in India to get together for the purpose of sharing each other’s experiences and enhancing their surgical skills. Starting from a humble beginning with 112 members in 1938, the Association of Surgeons of India is the world’s second largest surgical Organisation after The American College of Surgeons (which is the world’s largest surgical body)”.

Widely considered to be the ‘Voice for Surgery’ in the country, ASI promotes the art/science of surgery and strives to take the latest techniques in the surgical field to the remotest parts of the country in an endeavour to improve the lives of people all over India.

ASI’s vast network and influence is reflected in that it a strong presence in the form of State Chapters and City Branches in all the 29 states and Union territories across India in addition to 12 speciality sections comprising of specialist surgeons practising the art and science of breast surgery, onco surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, laparoscopic/minimal access surgery, endocrine surgery, genito-urinary surgery, paediatric surgery, plastic surgery, thoracic/cardiovascular surgery, trauma/critical care surgery in addition to sections representing rural surgeons and surgeons in the armed forces.

Dr. Raghuram polled the highest number of votes ever and secured the biggest ever victory margin in the 82 years history of the Association. Says Dr Raghuram, “My heartfelt gratitude to the membership at large for giving me the biggest ever mandate in ASI’s history. I promise to ensure creative leadership and accountable governance in the Association.”

Doctors’ well being

Hyderabad lost two doctors at a young age recently due to cardiac arrest. Steering the subject towards doctors’ well being, Dr Raguram says, “Doctors don’t seem to understand the importance of leading a balanced life and looking after their well being. Not sure if in general they have learnt the art of de-stressing. Spending quality time with my parents, spouse and children is a major stress buster for me. I also meditate and pray as part of must de-stressing activities. Practising the art and Science of Surgery and serving as president of the world’s second largest surgical organisation this year, are but just one component of my life. Being in the rat race of practice is not my cup of tea. In my personal view, operating on the highest volume of patients or seeing highest number of patients each day, is not an achievement in itself. Leading a balanced life is. We must not forget on a daily basis that we come into this world with nothing and, leave also with nothing. What matters is how well we live and that’s a balancing act which one has to consciously reflect regularly.”

ASI 2020 agenda

1. To provideeducation and training courses for surgical trainees and practising surgeons in an endeavour to make them better surgeons with a humane touch. In this regard, several courses are being rolled out across the country in collaboration with world renowned surgical organisations.

2.Hands that serve are holier than the lips that pray. Focus on community service through the state chapters and city branches of ASI across the country by adopting villages for the welfare of our community. India is predominantly a rural country with close to 70% of population and workforce residing in villages. It is therefore my wish and desire that every state chapter/city branch of ASI adopts a village and undertakes initiatives that are; village specific for the greater good of the community.

3. Establish rapport with the Government of India to ensure that ASI is actively involved in policy making matters relevant to surgery and surgical training. My mission will be strategic implementation of my goals with laser sharp focus and determination in an endeavour to significantly improve the delivery of surgical care in India. At the end of my term, I wish to be recognised and remembered as a “People’s President”.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/society/z2qd45/article30681694.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/raghuram,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/dr-p-raghuram-president-of-association-of-surgeons-of-india/article30681696.ece
503,2020/01/29,"Even low particulate matter pollution is bad for the heart, says study","There is a 1%-4% increased risk of cardiac arrest associated with every 10 µg/m3 increase in PM2.5, the fine particulate matter linked to a slew of respiratory diseases and cardiac ailments, according to report in the latest edition of Lancet Planetary Health. The study analysed a quarter of a million patients and was among the largest of its kind. It sought to proffer evidence that even low levels of particulate matter pollution are dangerous.

“Our study supports recent evidence that there is no safe level of air pollution — finding an increased risk of cardiac arrest despite air quality generally meeting the standards,” Professor Kazuaki Negishi, co-author and Professor, University of Sydney School of Medicine, said in a statement.

The study was conducted in Japan and correlated cardiac arrests and PM2.5, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide exposure. The researchers also studied pollution levels a day before and up to three days after a reported attack.

WHO standards

The records analysed were from Jan 1, 2014, to Dec 31, 2015. The scientists chose Japan because it had consistent and detailed measurements of cardiac events as well as pollutant records. A key objective of the study, the authors said, was to investigate a link between cardiac events and exposure to pollution levels that were within, or below, World Health Organisation (WHO) standards.

“More than 90% of (cardiac events) in our study occurred with PM2·5 levels lower than the WHO guideline and Australian standard daily average concentration of 25 μg/m3, while 98.5% of them happened at levels lower than the Japanese or American daily standard level of 35 μg/m3,” the authors note.

Older people were overwhelmingly more likely to be susceptible. The mean age of those with cardiac events was 74 years and 57% were male. “Given the growing body of evidence in areas with poor air quality or even where the target standard has been achieved, current air quality standards need to be reassessed with consideration for efficient strategies to reduce air pollutants to as low a level as possible,” the study added.

In India

The State of Global Air 2019, published by the Health Effects Institute (HEI), said exposure to outdoor and indoor air pollution contributed to over 1.2 million deaths in India in 2017. In India, air pollution is the third-highest cause of death among all health risks, ranking just above smoking.
