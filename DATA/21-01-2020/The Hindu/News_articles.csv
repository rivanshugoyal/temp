0,2020/01/21,Premier Badminton League | Warriors have the final say,"North Eastern Warriors pipped defending champion Bengaluru Raptors 4-3 in the Premier Badminton League (PBL) here on Tuesday.

With the contest tied at 3-3, it was the fifth tie — second men’s singles — that decided the outcome. Tanongsak Sansomboonsuk outplayed Brice Leverdez 15-7, 15-8 to spark celebrations in the Warriors camp.

Pulling level

Earlier, the men’s doubles Trump pair of Warriors got the team back on track as it came from 3-1 down to pull level. Bodin Isara joined hands with Lee Yong Dae, the London Olympics bronze medallist, to drub Arun George and Rian Agung Saputro 15-12, 15-6.

Despite his bulky frame, Bodin was unstoppable, attacking with gusto and pulling off some remarkable retrieves.

Chen Peng Soon, the 2016 Rio Olympic medallist, was the pivot as Bengaluru won the first match, the mixed doubles. Partnering Eom Hye Won, the Malaysian-South Korean duo put it across Lee Yong Dae and Kim Na Ha 15-8, 15-11 in the first rubber.

Falling flat

The second match, the men’s singles, between Sai Praneeth and Lee Cheuk Yiu fell flat as the 23-year-old from Hong Kong outplayed Praneeth 15-14, 15-9 as Warriors got their first point. The 23-year-old, ranked 18th in the world, seven spots below the Indian, has been in good form, shocking a few top 10 players.

In fact, in the Indonesia Masters early this month, Lee entered the semifinals with wins over Chou Tien Chen and Shi Yu Qi. He had won the Hong Kong Open last year, defeating Yu Qi, Viktor Axelsen and Anthony Ginting along the way.

Against Praneeth, he came up with jump-smashes and down-the line winners. His diving returns, when the point seemed lost, unnerved Praneeth.

As expected, World No. 2 Tai Tzu Ying, as Trump for Bengaluru, increased the lead (3-1) with a convincing 15-7, 15-5 victory over Ashmitha Chaliha. But it was Warriors’ Sansomboonsuk who had the last laugh.

The results:

North Eastern Warriors bt Bengaluru Raptors 4-3 (Lee Yong Dae & Kim Ha Na lost to Chan Peng Soon & Eom Hye Won 15-8, 15-11; Lee Cheuk Yiu bt Sai Praneeth 15-14, 15-9; Asmitha Chaliha lost to Tai Tzu Ying (T) 15-7, 15-5; Bodin Isara & Lee Yong Dae (T) bt Arun George & Rian Agung Saputro 15-12, 15-6; Tanongsak Sansomboonsuk bt Brice Leverdez 15-7, 15-8).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/8mqcpk/article30618713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22BAD,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/premier-badminton-league-warriors-have-the-final-say/article30618714.ece
1,2020/01/21,"40 Years of Sportstar, 40 Superstars","World badminton champion P.V. Sindhu launched the 40 Years of Sportstar, 40 Superstars book here on Tuesday.

Featuring essays by Vijay Amritraj, Shashi Tharoor, Michael Holding, Brian Glanville, and Rajdeep Sardesai among others, the book was commissioned to commemorate Sportstar completing 40 years and features a champion for each year, ranging from Bjorn Borg, Kapil Dev, Mike Tyson and Imran Khan to Rahul Dravid, Michael Schumacher, M.S. Dhoni, Mary Kom among others.

Each piece seeks to reflect on the importance of the year in the career of the chosen sportsperson and how it has revolutionised the history of the sport in question.

The 24-year-old Sindhu is one of the subjects, with tennis star Sania Mirza writing about her. “Sania is a dear friend, we meet from time to time. Her comeback from motherhood and her win this week has been phenomenal. I congratulate her for the win and it is an honour to be written about by someone like her,” said Sindhu.

The ace shuttler released the book along with L.V. Navaneeth, CEO, THG Publishing, and Ayon Sengupta, Editor, Sportstar.

“Sportstar marked its 40th year on July 15, 2018. It is only fitting to look back on our journey so far and pay tribute to the legends of sports who have dominated the landscape in these four decades. But this had to also be a tribute to writing, a tradition the magazine has held dear since its inception” said Sengupta.

Speaking on the occasion, Navaneeth said: “We have Little Master Sachin Tendulkar writing on tennis legend Roger Federer and West Indian great Michael Holding talking about fellow-Jamaican Usain Bolt. Each writer brings in his own unique style and understanding of the game and the editorial team has dug deep into our archives to curate images that enable us to relive many iconic sporting moments. This book is a testament to not just the Sportstar’s journey over the past four decades but also to the history of sport around the world.”

The book, priced at ₹999, can be pre-booked online with a discount of 20%.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/769i4v/article30618069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22SPORTSTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/40-years-of-sportstar-40-superstars/article30618070.ece

3,2020/01/21,Table tennis Olympic qualifiers | Indian men’s team primed to create history,"The Indian men’s table tennis squad is well placed to create history at the Olympic qualifiers beginning in Gondomar on January 22, the fifth seeds needing just a quarterfinal finish to ensure its maiden qualification as a team at the Summer Games.

Unless the team comprising G Sathiyan (world rank 30), veteran Sharath Kamal (WR 33) and Harmeet Desai (WR 86) play badly, India should not have a lot of difficulty in making the Olympic cut.

In the past games, Indian players have played only in individual events but now three of them being in top-100 shows the rapid strides India has taken at the highest level.

The men take on Luxembourg in their opening match and women, seeded 17th, face a formidable Sweden.

Ahead of the tournament, the squad had a camp in Chennai before it travelled to Germany to train with its national team.

Despite the lack of a head coach since the 2019 Asian Games, Indian players have been producing impressive on the professional circuit.

The men’s team had ended a 60-year wait by winning a historic bronze at the Asian Games in Jakarta.

The contingent’s campaign got even better Sharath and Manika Batra, who won four medals at the preceding Commonwealth Games, bagged a surprise bronze in the mixed doubles.

Nine qualifying spots are on offer at the ITTF organised event. A top-eight finish guarantees Olympic qualification.

Korea is the top seed in men’s category, followed by Chinese Taipei, Sweden, France and India.

4,2020/01/21,Making a splash: Swimmer Siva S on his future plans,"“Swimming is the most important part of my life. I have been swimming for 15 years,” says Siva S. He recently won two gold medals in the 400 meters individual medley, and 4X200 metres free style relay, and a silver for 200 metre individual medley at the recently held XIII South Asian Games at Kathmandu, Nepal in December 2019. “I grew up in Coimbatore and learnt to swim from the Perks Sports Academy. I was a hyperactive kid and my parents wanted to channelise my energy and introduced me into sports,” says the 19-year-old. He trained under coach Haridas and, by the time he was five, could do the butterfly stroke, back stroke, breast stroke and free style.

“I was six when I participated in my first competition in Chennai. I did not win and was a bit sad but I continued my practice and won three gold and an individual competition at my next competition at Jenney’s Club,” he says. On the suggestion of his coach, he moved to Bengaluru in 2007 for better professional training.

Siva prepared well for the South Asian Games, he says. “I focused on my speed and I am glad that it worked. I was able to set a record for the best Indian performance in South Asian Games for the 200 metre individual medley for my time 2:02:42.” It was tough, he recalls. “It was very cold and the competition was strong. Luckily, it was a temperature controlled pool. I met Olympian Matthew Abeysinghe from Sri Lanka and he shared details about his workout with me.”

Siva is an under-graduate student from Jain University, Bengaluru. “I have to juggle between my studies and workout. It is hard, but I try my best.” He practises for six hours every day for five days a week under his coach Padmanabh Rao. “Consistency in practice and self motivation are two important things to be a good swimmer. My training is intense and includes swimming and gym sessions. I swim 60 km a week. Weight training strengthens my muscles and gives me endurance,” he says. Siva also enjoys playing football and basketball. “But, that is only for fun.” His dream is to win a medal for the country in the Olympics. “The recent success has boosted my confidence. I am now preparing for the Olympics qualifications that will be held in April at Singapore. I hope I can make it.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/hjvbn5/article30614840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Siva-swimmer,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/swimmer-siva-s-on-his-future-plans/article30614841.ece
5,2020/01/21,An ode to winners,"After a playing career in which he made 132 first-class appearances, scoring nearly 8,000 runs, and featured in 11 Tests and 27 ODIs, WV Raman quickly earned a reputation as a shrewd, intelligent reader of the game. In his columns on cricket and interviews in the media, the former India opener comes across as a forthright, articulate man, never hesitant about expressing an opinion. It comes as no surprise then that Raman, currently the head coach of the Indian women’s team, has authored a book.

In The Winning Sixer, released formally by Anil Kumble here recently, the 54-year-old has drawn on his own experiences, and those of other athletes to derive leadership lessons from sport. Raman has interviewed a diverse set of sportspeople — from Kapil Dev and Jeev Milkha Singh to Sania Mirza and Geet Sethi — an experience he found thoroughly enjoyable.

After a book launch that was part family gathering, part veteran cricketers’ reunion, Raman sat down for a chat with MetroPlus. Excerpts:

What was the motivation behind writing the book?

I always felt that each one of us has a leader within us. The basic idea I want to convey through this book is that everyone can go on to become a leader. Leadership is important at all levels and in all walks of life. During my coaching career, I have seen that there is a tendency to load a lot of things onto children, instead of allowing them to experiment and evolve. Leadership is made up of a lot of attributes and qualities. That is what I have tried to convey, citing many sporting incidents, lives and careers of many sporting people.

How did you select the people you spoke to?

If you look at the people I have spoken to... they are all trendsetters. Look at Kapil Dev, he took up fast bowling when Indian cricketers were not even thinking about it. Take Jeev Milkha Singh, he turned a pro golfer when golf was not known very well in India. Sania Mirza again... in her own right she is a trendsetter. Geet Sethi too, for that matter. These people defied odds, dared them and conquered the world. That is also one aspect of being a leader.

How was the experience of talking to them?

It was great. They were brilliant. They were in different parts of the world. They said, ‘Okay shoot me an e-mail. Is there a deadline?’ I said: ‘Not really’. But they gave me a deadline which suited them and was well within mine. They were fantastic and showed me why they are the champions that they are. They made me realize the adage I had read: ‘Great men make others feel great’.”

How long did it take for you to complete the project?

Conceptualising was easy. After that, for every attribute I had to cite examples and make it interesting for the reader. Overall, it took me about 12 months. The actual writing part did not take that long. The project itself took 12 to 14 months.

You talk about ‘multi-dimensional skills’ being important to leadership...

The motivation is to make the reader aware that we are in an era where we have to be the Jack of all trades and master of one. Earlier, people used to scoff at you if you were a Jack of all trades. But today you need to have multi-dimensional skills. Nowadays, corporates employ people based not just on their core skills but various other things like leadership and soft skills. It is essential. Specialisation is fine up to a point. But if you do not develop multi-dimensional skills, what happens? If the industry that you specialised in goes through a rut, then you are struggling. We are seeing that happen in a lot of cases now. Even sport has become multi-dimensional. Gone are the days when a specialist batsman or bowler played. Things keep evolving.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/owf6uo/article30614490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGMRAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/wv-raman-launched-his-book-which-celebrates-sportsmen-and-their-leadership-qualities/article30614491.ece
6,2020/01/21,National shotgun trials from today,"Olympian Kynan Chenai will be one of the leading shooters competing in the National shotgun selection trials, scheduled to be staged at the Dr. Karni Singh Range, Tughlakabad, from Tuesday.

After the national championship, the shotgun shooters have already had one selection trial. They will have the second and third trials, with trap competition opening the action.

Two other leading trap shooters — former World Champion Manavjit Singh Sandhu and Prithviraj Tondaiman — do not figure in the list for the trials.

Shooters who have the required number of scores in national and international events, have the privilege to skip the trials.

Young shooters like Vivaan Kapoor, Manavaditya Rathore and the Asian Games silver medallist Lakshay Sheoran will be keen to climb the rankings list and be eligible for national duty in the main team.

Building their average

In the women’s section, Olympian Shagun Chowdhary, World Cup silver medallist Seema Tomar, Rajeshwari Kumari, Manisha Keer, Varsha Tomar, Kirti Gupta and Anam Basit will be some of the leading shooters in action, trying to build their average and represent the country.

Meanwhile, the first two sets of selection trials for rifle and pistol are scheduled to be held in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, from January 24 to February 8.

The rifle and pistol trials are scheduled to start with the men’s air rifle and will also have competition in non-Olympic events like free pistol, standard pistol, centre fire pistol and rifle prone.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/wdyxa1/article30609338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21CHENAI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/national-shotgun-trials-from-today/article30609339.ece

Top-ranked Rafael Nadal had no issues in the match at Rod Laver Arena, easily beating Hugo Dellien 6-2, 6-3, 6-0. “A positive start,” Nadal said. “What you want in the first round is to win straight sets.”

Only one of Nadal’s 19 Grand Slam singles titles have come at the Australian Open - in 2009 and he lost last year’s final to Novak Djokovic. He’s aiming to that around and win next week to equal Roger Federer’s men’s record of 20 major titles.

Dominic Thiem and Karen Khachanov were among the other highly-ranked men to advance to the second round.

Sharapova, a five-time major winner, got into the main draw at Melbourne Park via a wild card granted by organizers, helped by the fact that she won the 2008 title.

The 32-year-old Russian has had a series of right shoulder injuries and also served a 15 month suspension for a positive doping test to meldonium. Since her return from the suspension, her best showing at a major has been the quarterfinals at the French Open in 2018.

""I mean, I think I’m not the only one. I can speak about my struggles and the things that I’ve gone through with my shoulder, but it’s not really in my character to,” Sharapova said.

Second-seeded Karolina Pliskova beat Kristina Mladenovic 6-1, 7-5, sixth-seeded Belinda Bencic advanced 6-3, 7-5 over Anna Karolina Schmiedlova and 10th-seeded Madison Keys beat Daria Kasatkina 6-3, 6-1.

Johanna Konta, a 2016 Australian Open semifinalist, lost her first-round match to Ons Jabeur 6-4, 6-2. It was only her second match since she lost in the quarterfinals of last year’s U.S. Open because of a tendinitis-related problem in her right knee.

The 12th-seeded Konta lost in the first round at the Brisbane International and then withdrew from the Adelaide International in an attempt to manage her injury. Even before she left for Australia, the British No.1 told officials she wouldn’t play Fed Cup this year.

Konta had always made at least the second round in four previous appearances in the main draw.

""I think ultimately the main thing was to start playing again, and I am,” she said. “And, how I physically felt out there is obviously a massive tick for me compared to where I was in September of last year. Before Brisbane, I had been out for almost four and a half months. So it’s been quite a bit of time, not far off getting a protected ranking.”

After torrential rain hit Melbourne Park on Day 1, organizers had to move dozens of matches over to Tuesday.

Among those, 18-year-old Jannik Sinner completed a 7-6 (2), 6-2, 6-4 win over Australian qualifier Max Purcell, and 2018 Australian Open finalist Marin Cilic beat Corentin Moutet 6-3, 6-2, 6-4.

Fabio Fognini lost the first two sets on Monday against Reilly Opelka but rallied Tuesday to win 3-6, 6-7 (3), 6-4, 6-3 7-6 (5), including the 10-point tiebreaker in the final set. Milos Raonic returned to play two games to finish off Lorenzo Giustino 6-2, 6-1, 6-3.

Sinner, the Next Gen ATP Finals champion, only had to win two games on Day 2 to complete his first match win at a Grand Slam event.

“I was up in the score, so it was a little bit easier for me,” Sinner said of the suspension. “Obviously I wanted to finish yesterday. We waited here till 8.00 p.m., so it’s been a long day yesterday for me, for every player.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/q7l0ck/article30613652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARIASHARAPOVA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/sharapova-loses-nadal-advances-at-australian-open/article30613656.ece
11,2020/01/21,Sharapova uncertain over Australian Open return after first-round loss,"Five-time Grand Slam champion Maria Sharapova admitted she does not know if she will be back at the Australian Open next year after suffering a first-round defeat in Melbourne on Tuesday.

The former world number one, playing on a wildcard, is set to drop below 350 in the rankings following her 3-6 4-6 defeat to Croatia’s 19th-seeded Donna Vekic.

It was Sharapova’s third first-round exit in a row at Grand Slam tournaments, and will increase speculation over her future.

Sharapova, banned for 15 months for failing a drugs test at the 2016 Australian Open, was unable to say whether she would return next year.

“I don’t know, I don’t know,” said the Russian, already ranked 145th, when asked by AFP if she would be back at Melbourne Park in 2021.

“It’s tough for me to tell what’s going to happen in 12 months’ time.” Sharapova, who won the Australian Open in 2008, was similarly vague about the months or even weeks ahead.

“Honestly, I’d give you the answer, I just don’t know,” she said about what tournaments she will play in the near future.

“I haven’t thought of my schedule moving forward from here yet.”

After missing large chunks of last year with a shoulder injury, she needed a wildcard to compete in Melbourne.

Playing on the centre court, Rod Laver Arena—a sign of Sharapova’s enduring pulling power — she lost the first set in 36 minutes.

She broke to go 4-1 up in the second set, but Vekic struck back and sealed victory on the second match point when Sharapova fired wildly wide.

Sharapova said she was not taking much notice of her plummeting ranking.

“Last year I think I played seven or eight tournaments so I don’t know if I can look at the ranking and really think about it in depth,” she said, cutting a forlorn figure.

“Just because I really haven’t played and I was injured most of the year.

“You know, I certainly have to take that into account.” Sharapova, who last lost in the Melbourne first round in 2010, has struggled for form and fitness since returning from the ban for taking meldonium.

Sharapova, once a rival to Serena Williams at the top of women’s tennis, refused to blame her right shoulder problem for her latest early exit.

“I can speak about my struggles and the things that I’ve gone through with my shoulder, but it’s not really in my character to,” she said.

“I was there, I put myself out there (playing). As tough as it was, I finished the match -- it wasn’t the way that I wanted,” she added.

World no.122 Prajnesh lost in straight sets 6-4 6-2 7-5 against Japanese wild card Tatsuma Ito, ranked 22 places below the Indian, in a rescheduled first round tie that lasted for two hours and one minute.

With this loss, Prajnesh lost a golden opportunity to face Djokovic in the second round. Ito will now take on the Serbian in his next match.

This was Prajnesh’s fifth straight appearance in the main draw of a Grand Slam event having earlier played in the Wimbledon, French Open and the US Open due to his better rankings.

With Prajnesh’s ouster, India’s campaign ended in the singles event of the Australian Open.

13,2020/01/21,Former semifinalist Konta out of Australian Open,"Former semifinalist Johanna Konta is out of the Australian Open after losing her first-round match to Ons Jabeur 6-4, 6-2 on Tuesday. It was the 28-year-old British player’s second match since last year’s U.S. Open after being sidelined with a chronic tendinitis-related injury in her right knee.

Konta was broken in the final game of the opening set, broke back in the opening game of the second but Jabeur broke Konta in her next two service games and again in the final game of the match.

14,2020/01/21,"AI needs to be regulated, says Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai","Joining Microsoft President Brad Smith and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Monday called for new regulations for Artificial Intelligence (AI), saying the only question now is how to approach it.

Although new regulation is needed, “a cautious approach is required that might not see significant controls placed on AI,” Pichai, who was last month took over as the CEO of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, wrote in an editorial piece in The Financial Times.

“There is no question in my mind that artificial intelligence needs to be regulated. It is too important not to. The only question is how to approach it”.

“Companies such as ours cannot just build promising new technology and let market forces decide how it will be used. It is equally incumbent on us to make sure that technology is harnessed for good and available to everyone,” Pichai wrote.

According to CNET, the timing of the editorial coincides with a big push from Google to reveal some of the results of its own work in AI and bring tools it has developed out into the world.

The Alphabet CEO stressed that “international alignment will be critical to making global standards work” on AI.

We need to take a “principled approach to applying AI,” while offering Google’s “expertise, experience and tools. We need to be clear-eyed about what could go wrong,” he said.

His comments come as lawmakers and governments globally are considering to limit the use of AI in fields such as face recognition system — an issue close to Microsoft President Brad Smith’s heart who has often criticised the technology, urging governments to enact legislation regarding the technology.

“Unless we act, we risk waking up five years from now to find that facial recognition services have spread in ways that exacerbate societal issues,” said Smith.

Advanced AI, which is beyond chat bots, will soon be used to manipulate social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned recently.

In his famous debate with former Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma, Musk entered into a classic argument over the capabilities of emerging technologies such as AI.

Musk said that computers would one day surpass humans in “every single way”. He has predicted that a single company that develops “God-like super intelligence” might achieve world domination.

If not regulated or controlled soon, AI could become an “immortal dictator” and there will be no escape for humans, the SpaceX CEO had warned.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/cl0efk/article30613468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21NETSUNDARPICHAI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/ai-needs-to-be-regulated-says-alphabet-ceo-sundar-pichai/article30613469.ece
15,2020/01/21,"A look at 1,40,000 square-foot Bala Vikasa International Centre, Telangana’s latest startup incubator","It is a long drive to Keesara from the bustle of Hitec City — more than an hour and a half to be exact, if you count the mind-numbing traffic. Hyderabad is pretty used to Hitec City and Gachibowli being the nesting ground for budding technologists but leave it to ages-old Bala Vikasa to situate their new innovation centre on the outskirts of Secunderabad, past the Indian Army’s bunkers and training facilities.

A not-so-well-trodden dirt road reveals the terracotta tiles of the roof first, each hexagonal section rebelliously protruding from the centre of the building. Nearing the site, one can begin to understand why Bala Vikasa International Centre (BVIC) is happy where it is geographically; the building is surrounded by farming communities which is where the incubator’s USP lies.

From the beginning

To understand the legacy of Bala Vikasa, it is worth looking at its rich origin story which goes as far back as 1977 when Bala Theresa Singareddy Gingras and Andre Gingras, along with some friends, start SOPAR (Société de Partage) in Québec, Canada to help marginalised communities in India.

The company went on to establish itself as an NGO with development programmes in education, water and shelter sectors, with Indian partner societies. It was in 1991, however, when Bala Vikasa was created as a ‘sister NGO’ to SOPAR. Over the next 20 years, the incubator would empower women through development ventures (1994), bring about ‘Rythu Vikasa Sangam’ which taught farmers more modern agri-practices (1997), desiltation programs to help farmers save water (2000), and more.

In 2002, a training centre was set up in Warangal where global practitioners would participate in empowerment sessions with agricultural societies. The organisation did not restrict their activities to the State either; in 2018, they renovated a number of urban water bodies in Chennai to mitigate flooding and drought risks. Bala Vikasa’s activities have impacted more than five million rural people from around 6000 villages across six states.

All of this happened right under our noses, with a fraction of the marketing we see from certain other incubators.

The new centre

So now at the BVIC, with its ‘fresh concrete’ smell, Rahul Bhardwaj (head of Bala Vikasa), Vijay Kumar Machcha (lead of programs and advisory) and Satya Raj (incubation lead) stand in front of the building. There are already sprawling lawns with flowers planted but, most interestingly is that the surrounding geology of rocky hills and paddy fields are not touched. There is also a sizeable natural lake nearby.

“We were mindful of this,” says Rahul, “and because so much of our mission is about social responsibility, we wanted our building to reflect that. I think the most interesting part of this centre is something that no one will ever know unless we tell them... we had actually planned on making this out of bamboo.” It is impossible to fathom how a 1,40,000 in a 20 acre campus would be maintained, let alone one made of bamboo which would require extra care but it is safe to say that concrete was a wise choice.

Bala Vikasa worked with Total Environment, a Bengaluru-based architecture and design. While there are massive air ducts running through the building for air conditioning, the balconies and interiors are quite temperate. This is due to the old-school reverse convection method of building where cool air rises but is also evenly distributed across all levels. Across these levels are various facilities including an e-library, cafeteria and kitchen, multimedia studio, discussion rooms and more. At the moment, the building is partially running on solar energy but as the facility gets populated, the energy scheme will become more eco-friendly, says the team.

“When we have visiting academics and also longer programmes which last five to seven days, we also have a dedicated residential block with rooms and suites,” says Vijay, “and given the location, not everyone wants to or can drive back into the city. And we have the land for living accommodations too!”

Rahul, a strong believer in aggrandising farming communities, says the space will also offer networking opportunities to their in-house startups and visiting delegates, who often come from Canada. “Our model is not just about incubating, it has a lot to do with the bigger picture of India and where the country is headed. It’s wonderful to see young people asserting themselves in these sectors with avenues of future tech.”

Remarkable social enterprises — such as ILLA Enterprises and Rubaroo — will soon take residence at BVIC and are looking forward to reaping the rewards of these fresher facilities. However, moving into the facility will take considerable time as the interiors are yet to be finalised.

19,2020/01/21,Trump impeachment trial begins,"While U.S. President Donald Trump is at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Republicans and Democrats are gearing up for a clash on the rules and procedures of Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial at the Senate, which began in earnest on Tuesday.

Democrats have taken issue with a resolution introduced by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell containing rules around the timelines for the two sides to lay out their cases as well as the inclusion of evidence and testimony from witnesses not considered during the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry.

The President was impeached by the House on December 18 for abuse of office (by conditioning a crucial White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine on the Ukrainians announcing investigations into Mr. Trump’s rivals). He was also charged with obstruction of Congress.

Mr. Trump’s legal team, which includes Ken Starr, the independent prosecutor from the Bill Clinton impeachment, as well as constitutional lawyer Alan Dershowitz, filed a 171-page trial brief on Monday, arguing that an impeachable offence must include criminal behaviour.

Trial rules

Mr. McConnell’s resolution on trial rules, which will be taken up by the GOP-controlled Senate on Tuesday, gives House “managers”, who will serve as the prosecution, and the President’s defence team 24 hours each, over two days, to present their opening arguments.

Given that the trial sessions start at 1 pm each day, Mr. McConnell’s proposed rules could mean that opening arguments will run late into the night, or early morning hours — a schedule that Democrats found objectionable. “…Senator McConnell’s resolution stipulates that key facts be delivered in the wee hours of the night simply because he doesn’t want the American people to hear them,” a statement from Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said.

Mr. Schumer is expected to offer amendments to the rules on Tuesday.

“A trial where no evidence — no existing record, no witnesses, no documents — isn’t a trial at all. It’s a cover-up,” Mr. Schumer said in his statement. Mr. Trump’s team, however, has characterized Mr. McConnell’s approach as protecting the President’s due process.

“We are gratified that the draft resolution protects the [President’s] rights to a fair trial, and look forward to presenting a vigorous defence on the facts and the process as quickly as possible, and seeking an acquittal as swiftly as possible,” White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland told Politico.

New evidence

The two sides have also differed on the proposed treatment of new evidence and witnesses. While evidence from the House inquiry would be passed out to Senators, it would not be entered as evidence unless voted on, on a case by cases, by Senators. New witnesses, as per the proposed rules, would first be deposed by the Senate; Senators would then vote on whether or not to allow them to testify.

On the Democrat witness wish-list are former National Security Adviser John Bolton and Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. Mr. Trump’s Senate allies and his defence team have been working to prevent any Bolton testimony the Washington Post reported. Republicans are likely to seek a classified hearing from Mr. Bolton on national security grounds, as per the Post story, if they are unsuccessful in blocking it altogether.

Republicans, for their part, are expected to want testimony from Vice President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, if Democrats get their witnesses. The younger Biden’s dealings while on the board of a Ukrainian energy company Burisma, has been used by Mr. Trump and his associates as the ostensible reason for requesting the Ukrainians to make an announcement into investigating the Bidens.

""It would certainly be fair for the president and his team to be able to call witnesses that can provide material information on the charges. It would not be appropriate for the president to seek to call witnesses merely to try to perpetuate the same smear campaign that was foiled when his plot was discovered,"" Representative Adam Schiff, who is one of the House Managers, told CBS.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6txqk1/article30618518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Senate-trial,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-impeachment-trial-begins/article30618519.ece
20,2020/01/21,Trump calls climate activists ‘prophets of doom’ at Davos,"U.S. President Donald Trump took aim on Tuesday at the “perennial prophets of doom” on the environment, telling the annual Davos forum that warnings of climate crisis were “foolish”.

In a keynote speech to the 50th World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort, Mr. Trump touted fossil fuels, deregulation and a booming U.S. economy — a message in stark contrast to the dire warnings delivered by teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg and others.

“We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse,” Mr. Trump said hours after Ms. Thunberg told the World Economic Forum that governments had done “basically nothing” to reverse climate change.

With Ms. Thunberg in the audience, Mr. Trump branded those warning of out-of-control global warming and other environmental disasters “the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortune tellers”.

Mr. Trump ticked off what he said were previous predictions that had been proved wrong, ranging from over-population in the 1960s to “an end of oil” in the 1990s.

“We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy,” said Mr. Trump, apparently referring to his Democratic party opponents ahead of the presidential election in November.

Mr. Trump took the stage in Davos just after the Swiss President delivered a speech appealing for the world to care for the planet. But the U.S. leader heralded the U.S. as “number one producer of oil and natural gas”.

He rattled off numbers indicating what he said were huge savings for American consumers and invited Europe to buy more U.S. energy products.

The expansion of oil, gas and coal production has “been so successful that the U.S. no longer needs to import energy from hostile nations”, he said. “Our European allies no longer have to be vulnerable” if they “use America's vast supply”.

Mr. Trump said the U.S. was joining a newly announced international initiative called the “one trillion trees” project and he said he wanted to conserve “the majesty of God's creation and the natural beauty of our world.”

But he said technical innovation, not restricting economic growth, is the way forward.

21,2020/01/21,Greta Thunberg slams Davos elites on climate as Trump takes stage,"Young climate activists including Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg told business and political elites gathered on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum that they aren’t doing enough to tackle the climate emergency and warned them that time was running out.

At a panel in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, climate campaigners expressed hope that their generation could work with those in power to bring about the change needed to limit global warming even as Ms. Thunberg - a vocal critic of leaders’ inaction - said not enough has been done.

""We need to start listening to the science, and treat this crisis with the importance it deserves,” said the 17-year-old, just as U.S. President Donald Trump was arriving in Davos, where he later gave a speech. Trump has pulled the U.S. out of the Paris accord to limit climate change and has traded barbs with Ms. Thunberg on social media.

""Without treating it as a real crisis we cannot solve it,” Ms. Thunberg said , adding that it was time to stop burning fossil fuels immediately, not decades from now.

The Swedish teenager came to fame by staging a regular strike at her school, sparking a global movement that eventually earned her Time Magazine’s award as the 2019 Person of the Year. Last year she told leaders gathered in Davos that they should “panic” about climate change.

Speaking in the afternoon, Ms. Thunberg brushed aside Mr. Trump’s announcement that the U.S. would join the economic forum’s initiative to plant 1 trillion trees across the globe to help capture carbon dioxide from Earth’s atmosphere.

""Planting trees is good of course but it’s nowhere near enough,” Ms. Thunberg said. “It cannot replace mitigation,” she added, referring to efforts to drastically cut emissions in the near term.

Ms. Thunberg accused leaders of “cheating and fiddling around with numbers” with talk of cutting emissions to ‘net zero’ - that is, emitting no more carbon than is absorbed by the planet or technical means - by 2050.

While there has been widespread criticism both inside and outside the United States over Mr. Trump’s decision to pull the U.S. out of the 2015 Paris climate accord, Ms. Thunberg said the rest of the world, too, was effectively missing the targets set down in that agreement.

She dismissed the notion that climate change is a partisan issue, insisting that “this isn’t about right or left.”

Responding to those who have accused her of doom-mongering, Ms. Thunberg said her message was simply based on scientific facts, not irrational fears.

“My generation will not give up without a fight,” she said.

Salvador Gūmez-Colūn, who raised funds and awareness after Hurricane Marţa devastated his native Puerto Rico in 2017, said young activists are doing more than just talking.

""We’re not waiting five, 10, 20 years to take the action we want to see. We’re not the future of the world, we’re the present, we’re acting now. We’re not waiting any longer.”

Autumn Peltier, the chief water commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation of indigenous people in Canada, said plaudits are not what they are looking for at the World Economic Forum.

""I don’t want your awards. If you are going to award me, award me with helping to find solutions and helping to make change.”

Ms. Thunberg cited a report released in 2018 by the U.N.’s science panel that calculated the amount of additional carbon dioxide the atmosphere can absorb before global average temperature increases exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). Leaders agreed to try to stay below that threshold when they signed the 2015 Paris climate accord, but scientists warn the chances of doing so are dwindling.

Ms. Thunberg noted that the remaining carbon “budget” to confidently meet that target stood at just 420 gigatons of CO2 two years ago, the equivalent of 10 years of global emissions. Even with a more optimistic calculation, keeping the global temperature rise below 1.5 C would require a massive reduction in emissions over the next two decades.

“These numbers aren’t anyone’s political opinions or political views,” said Ms. Thunberg. “This is the current best-available science.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7qt8i/article30616559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THGRETATHUNBERG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/greta-thunberg-slams-davos-elites-on-climate-as-trump-takes-stage/article30616560.ece
22,2020/01/21,Taiwan reports first case of Coronavirus,"Taiwan on Tuesday reported its first confirmed case of the new SARS-like coronavirus as the government warned the public against travelling to Chinese city where it emerged.

The patient is a Taiwanese woman in her fifties, living in Wuhan, who returned to the island on Monday with symptoms including fever, coughing and a sore throat.

Asian countries have ramped up measures to block the spread of the new virus as the death toll in China rose to six and the number of cases jumped to almost 300 since it first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The Taiwan patient reported her symptoms to quarantine officials on arrival at Taoyuan airport and was immediately taken to a hospital for treatment, said the island's Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

The woman told officials that she had not visited any local markets or had contact with birds or wild animals while in Wuhan.

Authorities are monitoring some 46 passengers and crew from the same flight, the agency said.

The CDC raised its alert on Wuhan to the highest level, urging the public against travelling to the city unless necessary.

“We ask the public not to panic as the individual was taken to hospital directly from the airport and did not step into the community,” it said in a statement, adding that it reported the case to the World Health Organization and China authorities.

The coronavirus has spread to Thailand, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4kzoal/article30615905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THCORONAVIRUS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taiwan-reports-first-case-of-coronavirus/article30615906.ece
23,2020/01/21,Prince Harry arrives in Canada,"Prince Harry on Tuesday began a new chapter in his life as he landed in Canada to reunite with his wife Meghan Markle and their eight-month-old son Archie after a formal split with the British Royal family.

The 35-year-old Duke of Sussex was photographed stepping off a plane in Vancouver as he set off in a car to join his family. Ms. Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, is already in Vancouver Island with Archie. Their son Archie, who was born in May last year, has not been back to the U.K. since the family’s Christmas break on Vancouver Island.

Over the weekend, Prince Harry spoke of his “great sadness” as he described in his own words how he and his 38-year-old actress wife decided to take a “leap of faith” and step back as senior members of the royal family. “The decision that I have made for my wife and I to step back, is not one I made lightly,” he said in a speech for charity Sentebale, co-founded by him in 2006 to support those affected by HIV in Lesotho and Botswana in southern Africa. “The U.K. is my home and a place that I love. That will never change,” he said.

New exit deal

But it is expected that the couple plan to spend a majority of their time in Canada, a country Ms. Markle has known well from her days of shooting for the television series ‘Suits’. As part of a new exit deal cleared by Queen Elizabeth II, the couple will forsake their His and Her Royal Highness titles and also any claim over U.K. taxpayer funding through the Sovereign Grant as they begin their new financially independent roles.

They would not be representing the 93-year-old monarch in any official capacity once the agreement kicks in by the end of March. On Monday, Harry attended the U.K.-Africa Investment Summit — likely to be one of his last official royal engagements. On the sidelines of the summit in London, he had a private one-on-one meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson before setting off for Canada.

“I think the whole country will want to join in wishing them the very best for the future,” Mr. Johnson said. Details around the couple’s future security arrangements are in the process of being finalised, with the Canadian government having expressed some concerns around having to foot the enormous bill. But the Queen has expressed her full support to her grandson following the shock announcement earlier this month, resulting in an unprecedented split within the top rung of the U.K. Royal Family.

Prince Harry has made repeated references to the media as a powerful force, which was the primary reason behind his decision to remove his family from the spotlight as frontline royals.

“I know I haven’t always got it right, but as far as this goes, there really was no other option. What I want to make clear is we’re not walking away, and we certainly aren’t walking away from you,” he said, in reference to continuing his patronage for his charitable work.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/staam0/article30615859.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21JANTHBRITAIN-ROYALSHARRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/prince-harry-arrives-in-canada/article30615860.ece
24,2020/01/21,Business to remain unaffected despite U.S. escalations: Huawei CEO,"The chief executive of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei on Tuesday said he was ready for the United States to escalate a “campaign” against the firm this year but insisted it would not have a significant effect on business.

The comments by Huawei chief executive and founder Ren Zhengfei to business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos come amid a bitter court fight in Canada over a US demand to extradite Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who is his eldest daughter.

Huawei, the global leader in telecom networking equipment, has also been effectively banned by the United States from working with American firms on the grounds that it poses a national security threat — an accusation the company has consistently denied.

“This year, the U.S. might escalate their campaign against Huawei, but I think the impact on Huawei business will not be very significant,” Mr. Zhengfei told a session at Davos.

He said the company had invested intensely in protecting itself and was well-prepared this year.

“That's why we could withstand the first round of attack. In the year 2020, since we already have this experience from last year, we are more confident that we can survive, even further attacks,” he added.

'Used to being number one'

Meng Wanzhou went to court on Monday to fight extradition to the United States, with her lawyers calling the accusations against her “fiction”.

The U.S. alleges that Ms. Meng lied to HSBC Bank about Huawei's relationship with its Iran-based affiliate Skycom, putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against Tehran.

Ms. Meng has denied the allegations. She has been out on bail, living in one of her two Vancouver mansions for the past year.

Mr. Zhengfei has previously suggested that the case is part of a U.S. plot to crush Huawei, seeing it as a security risk.

Huawei said in December that “survival” was its top priority after announcing 2019 sales were expected to fall short of projections as a result of U.S. sanctions.

Washington has banned U.S. companies from selling equipment to Huawei, locking out the smartphone giant from access to Google's Android operating system.

“The United States... it is used to being the world number one and if someone is better than them, they might not feel comfortable,” said Mr. Zhengfei.

He said Huawei “used to be” an admirer of the United States and had notably been inspired by American management systems.

“From that perspective, the U.S. should not be overly concerned about Huawei and Huawei's position in the world,” he added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/q4yf09/article30615231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THHUAWEICEO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/business-to-remain-unaffected-despite-us-escalations-huawei-ceo/article30615232.ece
25,2020/01/21,"The world’s on fire, can’t be left to firemen alone to tackle it: Swiss President","Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga on Tuesday said the world is on fire and everyone needs to work together to tackle the dangers before our environment as it cannot be seen as a job of the firemen alone.

“I look at the state of the world with concern today. There is intolerance, hatred and revenge...We need to find the right balance for a common future,” she said during a special address at the 50th World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos. The President of the Swiss Confederation said, “The world is on fire. We are seeing rainforests burning in Amazon and bushfires in Australia. The ecological balance of this world is in danger and we need to understand what all would be the consequences for all of us.”

When economic benefits were placed above nature, the consequences for humans and the economy were immense, Ms. Sommaruga said. Drawing an analogy, she said biodiversity is like the Eiffel Tower of Paris and if you remove one screw from the tower each day, nothing will happen at first, but if you keep removing the screws, the tower will fall apart.

“We need politicians to take action in their own country and internationally on global warming and climate change,” Ms. Sommaruga said. She also showed a short video to delegates, underlining the importance of insects and biodiversity for the future of mankind. She called on the private sector to tackle the threat to biodiversity and urged politicians and all of civil society to take action. She expressed concern over politically motivated hate, intolerance and revenge.

Open-source platform

Professor Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF), outlined his vision for stakeholder capitalism, and launched a new open-source platform for people to share ideas to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), starting with the oceans. The world is in a state of emergency and the window to act is closing, he warned.

Dr. Schwab emphasised the need to take everyone’s point of view into account, especially the youth.

26,2020/01/21,"China coronavirus claims sixth victim, new cases top 300","The death toll from a mysterious flu-like virus in China climbed to six on January 21 as new cases surged beyond 300 and authorities fretted about the added risk from millions of Chinese travelling for the Lunar New Year holiday.

Around the world, airports tightened screening of travellers from China as officials confirmed the coronavirus strain is contagious between humans.

The World Health Organisation called a meeting for January 22 to consider declaring a global health emergency.

The outbreak, which began in the central city of Wuhan, also sent shivers through financial markets as investors recalled the fallout from China's Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2002/2003 that it initially covered up.

The SARS coronavirus killed nearly 800 people then.

“We'll stay at home during the holiday. I'm scared as I remember SARS very well,” said Zhang Xinyuan, who had been bound from Beijing for the Thai resort of Phuket before she and her husband decided to cancel their air tickets.

Authorities have confirmed more than 300 cases in China, mostly in Wuhan, a provincial capital and transportation hub, where the virus may have originated at a sea food market.

There have been six deaths in that city, Mayor Zhou Xianwang told Chinese state television on January 21.

The virus has been spreading around other parts of China, however, including five cases in the national capital Beijing. Fifteen medical personnel are among those infected.

Abroad, Thailand has reported two cases and South Korea one, all involving Chinese travellers from Wuhan. Japan and Taiwan also confirmed one case each, both nationals who had been to Wuhan.

“Information about newly reported infections suggest there may now be sustained human-to-human transmission,” said WHO's regional director for the western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai.

Taiwan on January 20 set up an epidemic response command centre. More than 1,000 beds were prepared in isolation wards in case the virus spreads further.

Market wobble

The mounting anxiety was transmitted to regional markets.

China's onshore yuan fell 0.6%, its biggest daily drop since August 26, 2019, while airline and travel stocks fell across the region.

European shares also slipped on concerns about the impact of the outbreak, with luxury goods firms particularly hard-hit on worries about weaker demand from Chinese consumers.

Though the origin of the virus was yet to be identified, WHO said the primary source was probably animal. Chinese officials have linked the outbreak to Wuhan's seafood market.

The virus can cause pneumonia, with symptoms including fever and difficulty in breathing. As those symptoms are similar to many other respiratory diseases, extra screening is needed.

“The outbreak of a SARS-like coronavirus in Wuhan is developing into a major potential economic risk to the Asia-Pacific region now that there is medical evidence of human-to-human transmission,” said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific Chief Economist for IHS Markit.

So far, the WHO has not recommended trade or travel restrictions but such measures could be discussed at Wednesday's meeting.

China's National Health Commission will also give an update at a press briefing at 10 a.m. (7.30 a.m. IST) on January 22.

Rush for masks

Airports in the United States, Australia and across Asia have begun screening passengers from Wuhan.

In the city itself, officials have been using infrared thermometers to screen passengers at airports, railway stations and other passenger terminals since January 14.

The Lunar New Year is a major holiday for Chinese, many of whom travel to join family or have a foreign holiday.

Images of long lines of people queuing to buy face masks were circulating widely on Chinese social media.

Some online vendors were limiting sales of masks and hand sanitisers as demand surged.

Shanghai city's market regulator warned it would punish speculators hoarding masks or other products used for preventing diseases, according to the Shanghai Observer, a web publication backed by a Communist Party newspaper.

But Zhong Nanshan, head of the National Health Commission's team investigating the outbreak, sought to ease alarm, saying in footage shown by state television there was no danger of a repeat of the SARS epidemic so long as precautions were taken.

27,2020/01/21,Iran confirms two missiles downed Ukraine airliner,"Iran on January 21 confirmed that two missiles were fired at a Ukrainian airliner that was brought down earlier this month on January 8, in a catastrophic incident that killed all 176 people on board and sparked angry protests.

The country's civil aviation authority said it has yet to receive a positive response after requesting technical assistance from France and the United States to decode black boxes from the downed airliner.

The Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines plane was accidentally shot down shortly after takeoff from Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport.

Iran has come under mounting international pressure to carry out a full and transparent investigation into the air disaster.

“Investigators... discovered that two Tor-M1 missiles... were fired at the aircraft,” Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation said in a preliminary report posted on its website late Monday.

t said an investigation was ongoing to assess the bearing their impact had on the accident.

The statement confirms a report in The New York Times which included video footage appearing to show two projectiles being fired at the airliner.

The Tor-M1 is a short-range surface-to-air missile developed by the former Soviet Union that is designed to target aircraft or cruise missiles.

Iran had for days denied Western claims based on US intelligence reports that the Boeing 737 had been shot down.

It came clean on January 11, with the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace commander Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh accepting full responsibility.

But he said the missile operator who opened fire had been acting independently.

Black box impasse

The deadly blunder triggered days of student-led protests in the Iranian capital.

Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Friday that the demonstrations were unrepresentative of the Iranian people and accused the country's enemies of exploiting the air disaster for propaganda purposes.

In its report, the Civil Aviation Organisation said it was “impossible” for it to read the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, commonly known as black boxes, because they were so advanced.

But it suggested Iran wants to keep them for now.

“If devices are provided, the information (on the black boxes) can be restored and retrieved in a short period of time,” it said.

The aviation body said it had asked its French and U.S. counterparts, the BEA and NTSB respectively, to provide a list of the equipment required to read the black boxes.

It said it had also sought the transfer of the equipment, but added that neither the BEA nor NTSB had “so far responded positively”.

It said it had acquired the list nonetheless, without saying how, and hinted it would use it to buy the equipment itself.

The report said that based on passports used to board Flight PS752, there were 146 Iranians, 11 Ukrainians including nine crew members, 10 Afghans and four Swedes on the ill-fated airliner.

Canada, which says 57 of its nationals were on the plane, has repeatedly asked Iran to hand the black boxes over to Ukraine or France for expert analysis.

U.S. -Iran tensions

The 737 was downed when Iran's air defences had been on high alert hours after its armed forces fired more than 20 ballistic missiles at U.S. troops stationed in Iraq.

That was carried out in reprisal for a January 3 U.S. drone strike that killed Iran's most prominent military commander, Qasem Soleimani, near Baghdad airport.

U.S. President Donald Trump had been poised to retaliate for the missile attack, but refrained after the missiles caused no casualties.

It was the second time in little more than six months that Iran and its sworn enemy have been on the brink of war.

In June 2019, Mr. Trump had approved a strike on Iran in response for the downing of a U.S. drone in the Gulf, before calling it off at the last minute.

Longstanding U.S.-Iran tensions have soared since May 2018 when Mr. Trump withdrew from a nuclear deal that offered Tehran sanctions relief in return for curbs to prevent it acquiring nuclear weapons.

Washington says it seeks to rein in Iran's ballistic missile programme as well as its “destabilising behaviour” in the region.

It has since slapped crippling sanctions on Iran, which denies it wants to acquire nuclear weapons and has hit back by progressively rolling back commitments to the nuclear deal.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/zbwhl8/article30599992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-CRASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-confirms-two-missiles-downed-ukraine-airliner/article30613696.ece

29,2020/01/21,Myanmar govt-appointed panel finds 'war crimes' but no 'genocide' against Rohingya,"A government-appointed panel established in Myanmar to probe allegations of abuses in Rakhine state in 2017 that drew global outrage said on Monday they had found no evidence of genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority.

More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Rakhine state during weeks of brutal violence, during which the United Nations says gang rapes and mass killings were carried out with “genocidal intent”. Hundreds of villages were burned.

Although the panel acknowledged “war crimes” had taken place, rights groups and Rohingya leaders dismissed the report as a “whitewash” days ahead of an expected ruling by the U.N's highest court on a genocide case against the country.

The commission of inquiry said there were “reasonable grounds” to conclude members of the security forces among “multiple actors” were responsible for possible war crimes and serious human rights violations during a military-led crackdown against the group in 2017.

These included the “killing of innocent villagers and destruction of their homes”, it said.

But in its statement, issued to mark the finalization of a full report based on interviews with villagers and members of the security forces, the panel blamed Rohingya militants for attacking 30 police posts and “provoking” the crackdown and described the situation as an “internal armed conflict”.

“The ICOE has not found any evidence suggesting that these killings or acts of displacement were committed pursuant to an intent or plan to destroy the Muslim or any other community in northern Rakhine State,” the panels statement read.

“There is insufficient evidence to argue, much less conclude, that the crimes committed were undertaken with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, or with any other requisite mental state for the international crime of genocide.”

Myanmar President Win Myint said in a statement on Tuesday the government “concurred” with the findings of the commission and vowed to pursue further investigations, specifically into alleged crimes by civilians and Rohingya militants.

He said he had given the report to the army chief, so that the military might extend ongoing investigations, he said, adding that the executive summary would be made public.

The army began a rare trial in November of soldiers and officers from a regiment deployed to Gu Dar Pyin village, the site of an alleged massacre of Rohingya.

Two spokesmen for the military could not be reached for comment by Reuters.

In Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled Myanmar have taken refuge, a Rohingya leader, Dil Mohammed, described the report as a whitewash.

“We have been persecuted for decades. So many of our people were killed, our women were raped, our children were thrown into fire and our homes were torched. If it is not genocide, what is it?” he said.

The International Court of Justice, the highest U.N. court, will this week issue a decision on a request for emergency measures in a genocide case against the country.

Gambia filed the suit in November alleging Myanmar was committing “an ongoing genocide” against the Rohingya.

The commission of enquiry was formed in 2018 as the country faced growing calls for accountability. The government appointed two local and two international members Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo and Kenzo Oshima, a former Japanese ambassador to the United Nations.

Myanmar says the international efforts violate its sovereignty and has vowed to carry out its own investigations into the allegations.

30,2020/01/21,"Greta Thunberg, Indian scientist Krithi among climate activists to be hosted at WEF summit","From activist Greta Thunberg of Sweden to conservation scientist Krithi Karanth from India, Swiss town Davos will host many climate actvists, scientists this week.

Going by the theme of the 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum, which calls itself an international organisation for public-private partnership, more than 3,000 global leaders will assemble here this week as ‘stakeholders for a cohesive and sustainable world’.

The WEF said, its 2020 annual meeting will be more action-oriented than ever with its Founder and Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab expecting it to be a “Do shop, not a talk shop”.

Helping bring about systemic change to return our planet to a sustainable path, there will be an unprecedented number of leaders from across civil society making progress at the community, national and global level, the WEF said.

There would be a number of ‘teenage changemakers’ attending the event, including Fionn Ferreira of Netherlands. As a young scientist, Fionn has created a project extracting micro plastics from water and aims to prevent them from reaching oceans.

Besides, it will be attended by Ayakha Melithafa, a 17 year-old South African who advocates for low-carbon footprint in her community and supports the inclusion of diverse voices in climate activism.

Autumn Peltier of Canada, on the other hand, has been advocating for water conservation since the age of 8, and is Anishinabek’s Chief Water Commissioner, representing over 40 First Nations in Canada.

Greta Thunberg is already famous as an international climate activist and a leader of the School Strike for Climate movement.

Melati Wijsen of Indonesia, with her initiative Bye Bye Plastics that she founded with her sister, has banned plastic bags, straws and Styrofoam in Bali since 2019.

The members from the civil society and academia include Gary Bencheghib of Indonesia. Gary’s film-making has brought home the impact of environmental degradation to millions of people. For example in a film he made navigating the world’s most polluted river in Java in a kayak made of plastic bottles.

Kerstin Forsberg of Peru has lead dozens of community-based environmental projects in Peru, engaging hundreds of citizen scientists and over 50 schools in marine education.

Salvador Gomez-Colon of Puerto Rico, after Huricanne Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, developed project ‘Light and Hope’ which supported over 3,000 families with solar lamps and manual washing machines.

Jane Goodall of USA is a world-renowned primatologist and her work has paved redefined the relationship between humans and animals.

From India, Krithi Karanth would be present. As Chief Conservation Scientist and Director of the Centre for Wildlife Studies, Kirithi’s work focuses on human-animal conflict and land use change.

Wanjuhi Njoroge of Kenya founded #SaveOurForestsKE as a campaign that raised awareness about the decimation of forests and led to a nine-month ban on national forest logging in the country.

Carlos Afonso Nobre of Brazil has dedicated his career to the Amazon region and developed pioneer research on the climate impacts of deforestation.

German citizen Johan Rockstrom’s work developing the planetary boundaries framework that facilitates human development while defending the planet’s boundaries is regarded as seminal.

31,2020/01/21,Eight EU nations back naval force to patrol Strait of Hormuz,"The French Foreign Ministry said Monday that eight European Union nations had given their “political support” for a new naval patrol to help avoid potential conflicts in the Strait of Hormuz, the strategically critical entry to the Gulf.

Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal backed the new force, whose mission headquarters will be based in Abu Dhabi.

A Dutch frigate is expected to launch the patrol rotations by the end of February, a French army official told AFP on condition of anonymity.

The move comes amid escalating tensions in the region, especially between Iran and the United States, that have sparked attacks on tankers and other conflicts in a crucial zone for oil shipping.

Iran is also backing Houthi rebels in Yemen who are locked in a years-long battle with a coalition force led by Saudi Arabia, which has led to ship seizures by Huthi fighters.

“For months this situation has jeopardised freedom of navigation and the security of both European and foreign ships and crews,” the Ministry said in a statement.

The Hormuz strait is considered especially vulnerable since it is only 50 kilometres (31 miles) wide and relatively shallow, with a maximum depth of 60 metres (200 feet).

The EU initiative also underscores the bloc’s goal of acting separately from the U.S., which launched its own operation alongside allies last November to protect shipping in Gulf waters.

France, Denmark, Greece and the Netherlands have already confirmed they will contribute to the patrols, which will be based in the United Arab Emirates, and “new commitments” are expected in the coming days, the ministry said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ekzi5d/article28813460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TH-TANKER1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eight-eu-nations-back-naval-force-to-patrol-strait-of-hormuz/article30612774.ece
32,2020/01/21,"Australia to screen some flights from China, warns coronavirus difficult to stop","Australia will begin screening passengers arriving from a Chinese city in a bid to stop the spread of a new coronavirus, the country's chief medical officer said on Tuesday, although authorities warned that an outbreak would be hard to prevent.

Chinese authorities have confirmed more than 200 people have caught the new virus, which causes a type of pneumonia that has killed four people in the central city of Wuhan.

Also read: What is the source of the new SARS-like disease reported in China?

The virus - which can pass from person-to-person - broke out in Wuhan but four cases have been reported in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, raising concerns about its spread through international air travel.

Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer for the Australian government, said biosecurity officials would begin screening passengers arriving on the three weekly flights to Sydney from Wuhan starting on Thursday.

Passengers would be given an information pamphlet and asked to present themselves if they had a fever or suspected they might have the disease.

Mr. Murphy said the measures only offered limited protection.

“You cannot absolutely prevent the spread of disease into the country. The incubation period is probably a week,” Mr. Murphy told reporters in Canberra.

“It's about identifying those with a high risk and making sure those who have a high risk know about it and know how to get medical attention.”

China is the largest source of tourists to Australia, with more than 1 million people arriving last year.

Around 160 flights arrive in Australia from China each week, and Murphy acknowledged Chinese tourists could arrive via other locations. There are only three flights from Wuhan each week, arriving in Sydney.

Australia's additional screenings come as hundreds of millions of Chinese prepare to travel domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday that starts this week.

Despite the elevated risk, Mr. Murphy said Australia would not begin scanning passengers for higher body temperatures, a precaution previously used during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak.

SARS killed nearly 800 people globally during the 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China, but Murphy said recent evidence indicated body-temperature screening was ineffective and created a false sense of security.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v799lv/article30582676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australia-to-screen-some-flights-from-china-warns-coronavirus-difficult-to-stop/article30612474.ece
33,2020/01/21,"Australian bushfires hit coal output, conditions to worsen","Mining giant BHP Group said on Tuesday that poor air quality caused by smoke from Australia's bushfires is hurting coal production, as authorities cautioned a reprieve from hazardous fire conditions could end within days.

The warning from the world's biggest miner underscores how an unusually long bushfire season that has scorched an area one-third the size of Germany is damaging the world's No. 14 economy. Australia's tourism and insurance industries have already foreshadowed they face a A$1 billion ($687 million) hit each from the fires.

“Smoke from regional bushfires and dust have reduced air quality at our operations, which has impacted December 2019 production,” BHP said in a trading update, referring to its energy coal plants in New South Wales state where hundreds of fires have raged.

“If air quality continues to deteriorate then operations could be constrained further in the second half of the year,” it added.

The fires have killed 29 people and millions of animals, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and razed 11 million hectares (27 million acres) of wilderness since September. Even with thunderstorms and rain in recent days, scores of fires are still burning on the east coast.

The disruption has extended to the capital, Canberra, and its two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, all of which have been repeatedly blanketed in thick smoke that has earned them air quality ratings among the worst in the world.

Last week, a tennis player collapsed during a qualifying round at the Australian Open tournament in Melbourne due to inhaling bushfire smoke, although the competition has continued in more moderate weather this week.

The Bureau of Meteorology forecast rising temperatures in the state of Victoria on Wednesday, combined with strong winds, creating a new risk of bushfires.

The New South Wales Rural Fire Service issued a high fire danger rating for Tuesday on the state's south coast.

The NSW state government, meanwhile, said it was increasing a grant for primary producers affected by the fires to A$75,000, from A$15,000 previously.

“Putting money back in people's pockets as soon as possible will allow affected communities to focus on rebuilding and repairing crucial infrastructure, treating, euthanising or burying livestock, as well as buying much-needed fodder,” said Minister for Agriculture Adam Marshall.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/37myo4/article30511705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABHINAYABUSHFIREAUSTRALIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australian-bushfires-hit-coal-output-conditions-to-worsen/article30612460.ece
34,2020/01/21,Nearly half billion people lack decent jobs: UN,"More than 470 million people worldwide are currently unemployed or underemployed, the UN said on Monday, warning that a lack of access to decent jobs was contributing to social unrest.

The global unemployment rate has remained relatively stable over much of the past decade, according to the UN’s International Labour Organisation.

But while the rate— which stood at 5.4% last year— is not expected to change much, overall jobless numbers are likely to inch up as slowing economies reduce the number of jobs available to a growing population.

This year, the number of people registered as unemployed is expected to rise to 190.5 million up from 188 million in 2019, ILO said in its annual World Employment and Social Outlook report.

At the same time, the UN body stressed that some 285 million people worldwide are considered underemployed, meaning they either work less than they want to, have given up searching for work or otherwise lack access to the labour market.

That amounts to nearly half a billion people and represents a full 13% of the global labour force, the ILO pointed out.

“For millions of working people, it is becoming increasingly difficult I think to build better lives through work,” ILO chief Guy Ryder told reporters in Geneva.

He warned that “persisting and substantial work-related inequalities and exclusion” were preventing many from finding decent work and thereby also creating better futures.

“I think that this is an extremely worrying finding,” he said, adding that lacking access to decent work appeared to be part of what was spurring growing protest movements and unrest around the world.

“Labour market conditions are contributing to... this erosion of social cohesion in many of our societies,” he said, referring to mass demonstrations in places like Lebanon and Chile.

According to the ILO’s “social unrest index”, measuring the frequency of things like demonstrations and strikes, there was an increase both at the global level and in seven out of 11 subregions between 2009 and 2019.

The ILO report highlighted that more than 60% of the global workforce currently work in the informal economy, often toiling for substandard wages and lacking basic social protections.

And in 2019, more than 630 million people— a fifth of the global working population -- lived in so-called working poverty, meaning they made less than $3.20 per day in purchasing power.

At the same time, the ILO report warned of significant income and job access inequality, driven by things like gender, age and geographic location.

In particular, it warned that a staggering 267 million young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are not in employment, education or training, while many more in this group endure substandard working conditions.

The study showed that the average share of national income going to pay wages and other labour costs shrank from 54% to 51% between 2004 and 2017.

And within the waged population, the gap between the highest earners and those at the bottom is “extremely unequal”, Mr. Ryder said.

The ILO report found that it took 11 years for the bottom 20 percent of wage earners to make the same amount as the top 20% make in a year.

“The situation is worse than we previously thought,” Mr. Ryder said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dvwr0o/article28102512.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TH-GUY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nearly-half-billion-people-lack-decent-jobs-un/article30612444.ece

37,2020/01/21,New Islamic State group leader identified: report,"Intelligence services have identified the new leader of the Islamic State (IS) group as Amir Mohammed Abdul Rahman al-Mawli al-Salbi, British newspaper The Guardian reported on Monday.

The paper, citing officials from two unnamed spy services, described him as one of the terrorist group's founding members and said he had led the enslavement of the Yazidi minority in Iraq.

It said he also oversaw operations around the world.

The organisation had named Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi as its new head just days after its previous leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a raid by US special forces in October.

The United States State Department added him to its list of most wanted terrorists in August, describing him as a “potential successor” to Baghdadi and offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to his capture.

Some analysts have suggested the group was caught off guard by Baghdadi's killing and that the true identity of its new leader remained uncertain.

The Guardian said Salbi was selected within hours of the death and that Quraishi was a nom de guerre not recognised by other senior leaders or intelligence agencies.

The newspaper described him as “a hardened veteran in the same vein as Baghdadi, unflinching in his loyalty to the extremist group”.

It said he was born into an Iraqi Turkmen family in the town of Tal Afar, and is one of the few non-Arabs among the group's leadership.

Holding a degree in Sharia law from the University of Mosul, he rose through its ranks in part thanks to his background as an Islamic scholar, the paper added.

Salbi gave religious rulings that underwrote the attempted genocide of Yazidis by IS, it said.

The US State Department said he was one of IS's “most senior idealogues” who had “helped drive and justify the abduction, slaughter, and trafficking of the Yazidi religious minority in northwest Iraq and is believed to oversee some of the group's global terrorist operations”.

In 2004 he was detained by US forces in Camp Bucca prison in southern Iraq where he met Baghdadi, according to The Guardian report.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/33k6bh/article30290270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IslamicState-12dec,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-islamic-state-group-leader-identified-report/article30612362.ece
38,2020/01/21,Honduras declares Hezbollah a terrorist organisation,"The Honduran government has formally declared Iranian-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah a terrorist organisation, a top security official said on Monday.

“We declare Hezbollah a terrorist organization and will include it in the registry of persons and institutions linked to acts of terrorism and its financing,” said Luis Suazo, Honduras' deputy security minister.

Heavily armed Hezbollah, a Shi'ite Muslim group, has also been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. government.

Last week, Guatemala's new president, Alejandro Giammattei, also signaled he would label Hezbollah a terrorist group, in addition to keeping the Guatemalan embassy in Israel in the city of Jerusalem.

Both moves were seen as aligning Guatemala's foreign policy more closely with that of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Israel's Foreign Minister, Israel Katz, called the Honduran government's move “an important step in the global war on terror” and said it built on similar actions taken in recent months by Britain, Argentina and others.

“I applaud the Honduran government for its important decision to declare Hezbollah a terrorist organization and to impose sanctions against it,” Katz said.

Israel considers Hezbollah, which is backed by its enemy Iran, the biggest threat across its border. The two last fought a war in 2006.

Britain's Treasury, or finance ministry, said on Jan. 17 it had expanded an asset freeze to include the whole of Hezbollah in addition to its military wing.

Last year, Argentina designated the group, which it blames for two attacks on its soil, as a terrorist organisation and froze its assets in the country.

Other countries that have designate Hezbollah or its military wing as a terrorist organization include Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union and Israel.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/honduras-declares-hezbollah-a-terrorist-organisation/article30610283.ece
39,2020/01/21,Iran lawmaker offers $3 million to anyone who kills Trump,"An Iranian lawmaker offered a $3 million reward to anyone who killed U.S. President Donald Trump and said Iran could avoid threats if it had nuclear arms, ISNA news agency reported on Tuesday amid Tehran’s latest standoff with Washington.

U.S. disarmament Ambassador Robert Wood dismissed the reward as “ridiculous”, telling reporters in Geneva it showed the ”terrorist underpinnings” of Iran's establishment.

Tensions have escalated since the U.S. pulled out of Tehran’s nuclear agreement with world powers in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions. The standoff erupted into tit-for-tat military strikes this month.

“On behalf of the people of Kerman province [the hometown of Qassem Soleimani], we will pay a $3 million reward in cash to whoever kills Trump,” Ahmad Hamzeh told the 290-seat Parliament, ISNA reported. He did not say if the reward had any official backing.

The city of Kerman, in the province south of the capital, is the hometown of Qassem Soleimani, a prominent Iranian commander whose killing in a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump on January 3 in Baghdad prompted Iran to fire missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq.

“If we had nuclear weapons today, we would be protected from threats ... We should put the production of long-range missiles capable of carrying unconventional warheads on our agenda. This is our natural right,” he was quoted as saying by ISNA.

The United States and it Western allies have long accused Iran of seeking nuclear weapons. Tehran insists it has never sought nuclear arms and never will, saying its nuclear work is for research and to master the process to generate electricity.

The 2015 nuclear agreement overall was designed to increase the time Iran would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb. Parties to the deal believed, at the time, Iran could produce enough material in two to three months if it wanted.

Under the deal, known as the JCPOA, Iran received sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear activities. In response to Washington's withdrawal from the pact and pressure from U.S. sanctions, Iran has rolled back its commitments to the deal.

This month, Iran announced it was scrapping all limits on its uranium enrichment work, potentially shortening the so-called “breakout time” needed to build a nuclear weapon.

Reports issued by the U.N. nuclear watchdog have suggested Tehran is still far from sprinting ahead with its work.

After Iran's latest step, Britain, France and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism in the nuclear pact, starting a diplomatic process that could lead to reimposing U.N. sanctions.

Iran said on Monday that Tehran would pull out from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if international sanctions were reimposed.

The U.S. envoy Mr. Wood said Iran's threat to quit the treaty, the foundation of global nuclear arms control since the Cold War, would send a “very, very negative message”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-lawmaker-offers-3-million-to-anyone-who-kills-trump/article30618208.ece

Team leader Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert, said two people in Guangdong province in southern China caught the virus from family members, state media said. Some medical workers have also tested positive for the virus, the English-language China Daily newspaper reported.

The late-night announcement capped a day in which authorities announced a sharp uptick in the number of confirmed cases to more than 200, and China’s leader called on the government to take every possible step to combat the outbreak.

Mr. Xi’s remarks were reported by state broadcaster CCTV on its main 7 p.m. evening news broadcast.

Instagram launched IGTV in 2018 in an effort to compete with YouTube, but then TikTok came along. Before IGTV, Instagram had only allowed people post videos that were 60 seconds or shorter.

Almost seven million of Instagram’s one billion-plus users have downloaded its standalone IGTV app in the 18 months since launch. For reference, TikTok received 1.15 billion downloads in the same period since IGTV launched, TechCrunch reports.

45,2020/01/21,"With new launches, Hyundai sees India demand growth in 2020","Hyundai Motor India expects to see growth in demand for its vehicles in 2020 on the back of a slew of product launches slated for this year, a senior company executive said. The company, which, on Tuesday, launched Aura, a new compact sedan, is expected to introduce newer models of Tuscon, i20, Creta and Verna. Hyundai is also looking at entering the multi-purpose vehicle segment in the country.

“We should see positive growth [this year]. With product launches planned this year, we expect to outperform industry in a very competitive environment, and hopefully, gain market share,” the company’s MD and CEO S.S. Kim told The Hindu. In 2019, Hyundai saw its sales decline about 7% compared with a decline of 13% for the industry. Mr. Kim added that in 2020, the industry should see low single-digit rise in demand. “Automotive vehicle demand will be determined based on various factors... maybe the most important and basic one will be the macroeconomy factor,” he said.

Given the impending transition to newer emission norms, growth may remain flat in the January-March quarter, he said. “From the second quarter, we are cautiously positive about demand.” The Aura, priced between ₹5.79 lakh and ₹9.22 lakhwill compete with the likes of Maruti Suzuki’s Dzire and Honda’s Amaze.

Asked why the firm chose to introduce a compact sedan amid declining sales in the segment, he said, “A lot of first-time buyers and family-centric car owners want to drive a sedan.” The segment ended 2019 with sales of 3.38 lakh units or about 11% of the industry, he added. “Even if it is decreasing, it remains a substantial volume...”

Nielsen said FMCG grew at 9.7% in 2019, much lower than the previous year’s growth of 13.5%. Further, the growth trend was dampened by a drop in volume growth — down to 5.8% from 10.5% in 2018 — while price-led growth sustained at 3.4%.

“[The year] 2019 has been a tough year for the FMCG industry with a four percentage point decline, but we do see it stabilising in the last quarter of the year. A mix of macroeconomic factors, and channel and zone factors driven by manufacturers, coupled with consolidation of smaller players have been instrumental in the slowdown,” said Prasun Basu, South Asia Zone President, Nielsen Global Connect.

“A lower pace of innovation has further limited consumer demand pick up. However, 2020 offers a stable outlook for the industry arresting the 2019 decline,” he added. More importantly, the growth in the last quarter of 2019 — although much lower than the corresponding year-earlier quarter — showed signs of the slowdown stabilising to a certain extent.

“The last quarter of 2019 saw the FMCG industry grow at 6.6% (7.3% with e-commerce), indicating an arrest as against the sharp slowdown witnessed in the previous quarters. The same period a year ago was a high double digit (15.7% in Q4 2018),” said Nielsen.

Going ahead, the growth in the first quarter of 2020 is expected to be in the range of 8% to 9% — the lowest first quarter growth in three years. Nielsen expects the full year growth to be between 9% and 10%.

Rural demand recovery

In a similar context, rating agency Crisil has said that an expected recovery in rural demand, coupled with steady urban demand, is set to lift revenue growth of the FMCG sector to 10-11% in fiscal 2021, close to the levels witnessed in fiscal 2019.

“Rural demand is expected to recover gradually from March-April 2020, riding on an increase in farm incomes given better storage levels in reservoirs after a good monsoon, better rabi output and good visibility for the upcoming crop seasons,” stated Crisil.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/afdk5f/article30618581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THBUFMCG,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fmcg-growth-slows-to-single-digit-in-2019-nielsen/article30618582.ece

50,2020/01/21,"Platforms see overlap of eatery listings, says Frost & Sullivan","The Zomato-Uber Eats deal is reflective of technology trends in India, where Amazon-Flipkart in the e-commerce space and Uber-Ola in the ride-hailing arena have essentially made their respective markets a duopoly, a Frost & Sullivan analysis pointed out.

“With Zomato’s acquisition of Uber Eats, battlelines in the food delivery space have been [re]drawn, as Swiggy and Zomato battle it out for supremacy,” the report said.

With this deal, Zomato would get an expanded delivery network and capacity by on-boarding Uber Eats’ large network of delivery partners, estimated to be 65,000 riders, without burning too much cash, it said.

“An additional benefit is the potential to [add to] the number of restaurants on its platform, especially in south India, where Swiggy holds sway. However, this factor is likely to have only limited impact, considering that in the 40-odd cities where Uber Eats had presence, Zomato already has almost 85-90% of restaurants on its network. In other words, it gets to add only 10% of Uber Eats’ unique set of restaurants,” it said.

Swiggy still leads?

Despite this transaction, Swiggy remained arguably the leading market player in the country, it said. “It will be interesting to see how intense the rivalry between Swiggy and Zomato will get.

With new players such as Reliance and Amazon likely to enter the market, 2020 could be a ground-breaking year for food delivery in India.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/28lpc3/article30618524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THBUUBEREATS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/platforms-see-overlap-of-eatery-listings-says-frost-sullivan/article30618525.ece
51,2020/01/21,Zomato buys Uber Eats in $300 million all-stock deal,"Zomato on Tuesday announced the acquisition of Uber’s food delivery business Uber Eats, in India, in an all-stock deal that will give the U.S.-headquartered ride-hailing services 9.99% stake in Zomato.

Effective Tuesday, Uber Eats’ operations in the country have been discontinued and users, along with restaurants and delivery partners are being directed to Zomato.

Uber, which is aiming to turn profitable by 2021, had launched Uber Eats in India in 2017, and has about 26,000 restaurants listed on the platform across 41 cities.

According to sources, while the Uber Eats India business comprised 3% of the global gross bookings for the company, it accounted for more than 25% of the company’s adjusted EBITDA losses for the first three quarters of 2019 amid stiff competition from Zomato and Swiggy.

Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO, Zomato, said in a blog that delivery partners associated with Uber Eats India would be on-boarded to Zomato’s fleet. However, a source aware of the details said that there was nothing in the deal about absorbing the 245 executive-level employees. “This will affect about 245 employees. They will remain with Uber Eats till March. Some of them might be absorbed in some roles in Uber,” the source added. While the two companies did not share any financial details, the deal size is estimated to be about $300-350 million.

Stating that this acquisition significantly strengthened Zomato’s position in the category, Mr. Goyal said, “We have acquired Uber Eats India, and with this development, we are the undisputed market leaders in the food delivery category in India.”

He added that the competition in this space would continue to be intense and the food delivery category was still very small when compared with the overall food service market in India.

“This category will continue to grow and get built over the next couple of decades, as we work hand-in-hand with restaurants and food service providers to [deliver] better food to more people.”

A source added that the deal would enable Uber to focus on its core business. The growth in India will be driven by products such as Moto and Auto as the company looks to expand operations to 200 cities in India, from the current 50 cities.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/mmip44/article30618495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Zomatobw,https://www.thehindu.com/business/zomato-buys-uber-eats-in-300-million-all-stock-deal/article30618497.ece
52,2020/01/21,Fujitsu General to double market share in India,"Japanese air-conditioner maker Fujitsu General plans to double its market share India in the next two to three years., said a top official. “Currently, we have a market share of 3% and we will consider setting up a manufacturing unit in India when it reaches 6%,” said Etsuro Saito, president, Fujitsu General Ltd. (FGL) Japan. “To achieve this, we are launching new models aimed at the mass Indian AC market for rapid growth,” said Mr. Saito.

The company’s products retail under the O’General brand. Mr. Saito said that the Indian room air-conditioner market consumed seven million units and was growing at 10% to 12% annually. Fujitsu General focused on mass market by unveiling new models of inverter split ACs.

FGL has training centres in different parts of the country. The next centre will come up in one of the four major Indian cities during the current year. This would be followed either by R&D Centre or a manufacturing unit, said Matsumoto Koji, MD, Fujitsu General (India) Pvt. Ltd. (FGIPL).

FGIPL, a subsidiary of FGL, had earlier announced its plan to set up a manufacturing unit in the south. But, it was deferred as the sales volume had remained flat at 2,00,000 units per annum for FY18 and FY19.

“To tackle this, we are focusing on mass market (three-star AC) products. They will be imported from Thailand. It was the major missing market segment for us. With this, we are expecting a 50% growth in our sales volume for the next two to three years continuously,” said K.C. Poovaiah, head, sales and marketing, FGIPL.

Last year, FGIPL sold 2,00,000 units valued at $100 million and this year, it plans to sell 3,00,000 units valued at $150 million. Of this, split AC and inverter ACs would account for a major share of the revenue, said Mr. Koji.

Asserting that they have always been a high-end brand focusing on delivering high-end products, Mr. Poovaiah said still O’General ACs were being sold at a premium. But they would like to reduce end-consumer prices by about 10% to make them affordable.

According to him, FGIPL offered 24 models with prices ranging from ₹25,000 to ₹1.50 lakh a piece in the five- star category.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ez59cs/article30618480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THBUFUJITSO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fujitsu-general-to-double-market-share-in-india/article30618481.ece

The manufacturer of steering and suspension products and die-casting components posted a total net revenue of ₹280 crore compared with ₹341.9 crore in the year-earlier period. It was a challenging quarter with steep volume drop in Indian business.

During the period under review, sales to Indian original equipment customers declined 25% across commercial vehicle and farm tractor segments.

54,2020/01/21,SBI sees retail inflation at 8% in January,"There could be more bad news on the inflation front which saw a five-year high of 7.35% in December. The State Bank of India (SBI) has projected consumer price index-based inflation at between 7.8-8% for January in case the current trends in vegetable prices continues.

The report from SBI said core inflation could rise further on the back of telecom price increase and a larger increase could push headline inflation closer to 8%.

“Specifically, we find evidence that retail food prices vis-à-vis wholesale food prices decline slowly when inflation is declining and rising at a much faster pace when inflation is rising, indicating that inflationary expectations are always entrenched and take time to die down,” Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, SBI, who authored the report, said, adding that this did not portend well for the CPI trajectory going ahead.

56,2020/01/21,Red Ridge invites global brands to shift base to India from China,"With the cost of manufacturing going up in China and many international brands looking out for cost-efficient destinations, Red Ridge Global is sensing opportunity here.

The Chinese firm, started by Indian-origin founder Vickram Rana in 1998, is seeking to induce clients to shift their manufacturing base to India by offering to buy the entire production output and distribute the products across India and global markets.

With global revenus of $500 million, Red Ridge Global is one of China’s largest arts, craft and learning kit suppliers having showrooms in the U.S., India, Canada, Malaysia and China. It has manufacturing and packing units in the U.S., Canada, Hong Kong, India and in Shanghai, Ningbo and Guangzhou.

In India, it operates via its 100% subsidiary Stone Sapphire India, which has established a distribution network across the country, besides manufacturing and distributing its own Sk’oodle brand of stationery products and art materials.

Through third-party manufacturing units in Gujarat and elsewhere, Stone Sapphire has managed to achieve production that is 30% cheaper than the cheapest products in China, thus making a strong case to attract multinational firms to shift manufacturing to India.

Banking on its strong distribution network, Stone Sapphire connects global brands with idle manufacturing units and ensures manufacture of quality products as per global specifications and then takes care of distribution by creating new market opportunities.

As a first step to boost ‘Make in India’, the company has tied up with leading global toy company Hasbro for local manufacturing and is now its distribution partner in India. The company, through its parent Red Ridge Global, is negotiating with more toy companies to shift manufacturing from China to India. Brands in other categories are also being tapped.

“With our specialised business expertise and strong presence in India, we hope to be a one-stop solution for any global toy brand that wishes to spread its footprint in India. There are several benefits that they will enjoy under the government’s Make in India initiative,” said Vick Rana, chairman and CEO, Red Ridge Global.

“India is one of the fastest growing markets with immense possibilities but comes with its challenges of compliances and requires a nuanced understanding of the various regional markets. At Stone Sapphire, toy manufacturers will find all answers, support and the best distribution that would take them to India’s farthest corners. We will soon announce some more names which will be shifting base to India,” Mr. Rana said.

Commenting on the Indian business Shobhit Singh, director, Stone Sapphire India, said, “With our 360- degree support in manufacturing consultancy and access to the largest distribution network in India, we hope to help children enjoy play time both indoors and outdoors in a cost-effective manner. We will replicate our parent’s Chinese business model here and grow sharply.”

He said Stone Sapphire had already invested ₹100 crore to build technology and the distribution network in the country and will invest another ₹400 crore by 2022. By that time, the company projects a revenue of $200 million, Mr. Singh said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/red-ridge-invites-global-brands-to-shift-base-to-india-from-china/article30618413.ece
57,2020/01/21,Most executives out of touch with business: Cognizant-MIT study,"Most executives around the world are out of touch with what it takes to lead effectively and for their businesses to stay competitive in the digital economy, says a Cognizant study done in collaboration with MIT Sloan Management Review.

The report titled “The New Leadership Playbook for the Digital Age: Reimagining What It Takes to Lead,'' was done based on a survey of 4,394 global executives from over 120 countries, 27 executive interviews, and focus group exchanges with next-gen global emerging leaders.

As per the study, only 12% of respondents strongly agree their own business leaders have the right mindsets to lead them forward, and only 9% agree that their organisation has the skills at the top to thrive in the digital economy. Only 13% strongly agree their organisations are prepared to compete in increasingly digitally-driven markets and economies.

A large majority, 71%, of respondents believe that they are personally prepared to lead in the digital economy. The same group scores significantly lower when asked whether they possess specific digital skills, such as using data analytics to influence their decision-making (55%) or advocating for the use of machine learning technologies in their organisations’ operations (50%), as per the study.

While 82% agree the new economy will need “digitally-savvy” leaders, less than 10% strongly agree their organisations have the right leadership to thrive in the new digital economy. Also, just 40% believe that their organisations are taking the necessary steps to build robust digital leader pipelines.

“A generation of leaders in large companies are out of sync, out of tune, and out of touch with their workforces, markets, and competitive landscapes. What got them to their current exalted status won't be effective much longer — unless they take swift action,” said Benjamin Pring, report co-author and director of the Center for the Future of Work for Cognizant.

“Allowing unprepared senior executives with outdated skills and attitudes to stick around forces next-generation, high-potential leaders to move on to new pastures, which harms morale and ultimately shifts the organisation further away from where market demand is heading.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/most-executives-out-of-touch-with-business-cognizant-mit-study/article30618224.ece

The company, which has got to a flying start in the country with its first product Seltos, aims to bring in two more models this year. It will drive in luxury multi purpose vehicle Carnival at Auto Expo, followed by a compact SUV later during the year.

Similarly, the company would also look at bringing in two more products next year as well.

“We have already stated that we will keep introducing a new model every six months. Our first goal right now is to fully exhaust the installed production capacity,” Kia Motors India Head Marketing and Sales Manohar Bhat told PTI. It should take around 4-5 models from the company’s stables to achieve the target in 2022, he added.

Kia Motors’ manufacturing facility in Andhra Pradesh has an installed production capacity to roll out 3 lakh units per annum on a three shift basis. The company is currently running two shifts at the plant.

There is no product like it in the country right now. It would meet the evolving needs of elite customers in the country,” Bhatt said.

Carnival will be powered by a 2.2 litre diesel engine with a claimed fuel efficiency of 13.9 km per litre.

“We will redefine the market place with this product as well as we did with Seltos. It will have BS-VI compliant engine right from the start,” Bhat said.

The government has maintained that the amendments made to the Citizenship Act of 1955 were meant to protect and welcome religiously persecuted people fleeing the three neighbouring countries where Muslims form the majority.

The top court had on December 18 issued a formal notice admitting the petitions filed by people from all walks of life and faiths: parliamentarians, retired High Commissioners, service officers, lawyers, students, activists, professional associations, Opposition political parties and NGOs.

The petitions argued that the law welcomes “illegal migrants” into India selectively on the basis of their religion and pointedly excludes Muslims. They have submitted that it has an “unholy nexus” with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise and is against the principles of secularism, right to equality and dignity of life enshrined in the Basic Structure of the Constitution.

The petitions said the Act selectively agrees to grant citizenship benefits to illegal migrants from only three countries. Besides the new law does not impose any requirement on illegal migrants to prove their claim of religious persecution or even a reasonable fear of it, the petitions said. The petitions have argued that the legislation effectuates discrimination on the basis of the intrinsic and core identity of an individual, that is, his religious identity as a Muslim. While Muslim migrants would have to show their proof of residency in India for at least 11 years, the law allows illegal migrants from the six communities to be naturalised in five years' time.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3qhma8/article30618471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-to-hear-144-pleas-on-citizenship-amendment-act-on-january-22/article30618472.ece
64,2020/01/21,"MDL, L&T shortlisted for submarine tender","The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday cleared Mazgaon Docks Limited (MDL) and Larsen & Toubro (L&T) as the Indian partners in the Navy’s tender for six advanced submarines under Project-75I worth over ₹45,000 crore.

It rejected an Adani Defence and Aerospace-Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL) joint bid on technical grounds.

The DAC also approved deals worth ₹5,100 crore, which includes electronic warfare systems for the Army to be developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured locally by the Indian industry.

This was the first DAC meeting after the constitution of the Chief of Defence Staff and was attended by Gen. Bipin Rawat.

“The DAC approved shortlisting of Indian Strategic Partners (SP) and the potential Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) that would collaborate with SPs to construct six conventional submarines in India,” the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in a statement.

This project, under the Strategic Partnership (SP) model, aims to promote the role of the Indian industry in defence manufacturing and build a defence industrial ecosystem. With this there are now two Indian SPs and five OEMS in the shortlisted pool for the project. The Request For Proposal (RFP) would be issued to the Indian partners who would tie up with an OEM and submit a bid. The five OEMs are Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) (South Korea), Naval Group (France), Navantia (Spain), Rosoboronexport (Russia) and TKMS (Germany).

Indian Navy opened the responses from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) to its Expression of Interest (EoI) on September 24. Just before the Swedish defence major SAAB pulled out of the race while DSME made a last minute entry. The Request for Information (RFI) was issued in mid-2017, but further progress was held up for want of clarity on some aspects of the SP model. The EoI for the project was issued to Indian partners and foreign OEMs in June 2019.

The electronic warfare systems will be used in deserts and plains and will provide comprehensive electronic support and counter measure capabilities to the field formations. “The DAC also approved prototype testing of trawl assemblies designed by DRDO for T-72 and T-90 tanks providing an important indigenous de-mining capability to the Army, the statement said.

In addition, DAC accorded approval for inclusion of Innovations for Defence Excellence (iDEX) scheme in the Defence Procurement Procedure which would provide opportunities in capital procurement to start ups and innovators working for iDEX.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/312s3n/article24671747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THSUB-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mdl-lt-shortlisted-for-submarine-tender/article30618176.ece
65,2020/01/21,AMU V-C’s wife reaches out to protesting students,"Hameeda Tariq, wife of Aligarh Muslim University Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor, on Tuesday reached out to protesting students in the university, and expressed “regret” over the injuries they suffered during the police action on December 15 when their protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act allegedly turned violent.

“As a mother, I can feel the trauma you faced,” said Hameeda Tariq, a paediatrician, while talking to a group of students at the sit-in protest site. Apart from a roll-back of the CAA, the students are demanding the resignation of the V-C and the Registrar.

She asked the students to give the V-C the “benefit of the doubt”.

“Sometimes, a person takes an action without knowing its repercussion. It should not be construed as wilful,” she could be heard saying in a video while referring to the permission given by the university administration to the police to enter the university on December 15. She said the police were called to restore public order and not to enter a hostel.

However, when the students refused to give the V-C a clean chit and said his one decision changed the course of a peaceful protest, she said, if they were “asking for the resignation,” they should hold a dharna at the President House in Delhi. “She said students should not ask for the resignation of the V-C and instead, concentrate on the ensuing exams,” said Faizul Hasan, former president of the AMU Students’ Union, (AMUSU), who was present during the meeting.

Faizul Hasan, former president of the AMU Students’ Union, said if the V-C was “regretful,” he should have come himself.

“She said students crossed the line of peaceful protest on December 15 which is not true,” said Mr. Hasan.

‘Part of education’

Another student requesting anonymity said students were focussing on their studies as well and the protest against the CAA-NRC was also part of their education. “I also wonder if they consider us as a family. Why the VC and his wife could not visit us together? She should know that if the balm is not applied on time, an injury could turn into a sore,” he said.

Meanwhile, Salman Imtiaz, president, AMUSU (2018-19), has appealed to the members of the AMU Court to take a serious note of the situation and asked for immediate intervention.

‘Suspicious people’

Apart from the events of the last 36 days which have “eroded the students’ faith in the university administration”, Mr. Imtiaz pointed out the presence of “suspicious people” on the campus. “Multiple pieces of evidence have emerged in the last seven days wherein suspicious people having police background are seen entering campus and questioning students. To date, the AMU administration has failed to find these people, though students have made the CCTV footage available,” he alleged. Afifullah Khan, proctor, AMU, denied any such development. “The former students who are wanted in vitiating the atmosphere of the campus get paranoid by the sight of any man in uniform,” he said.

FIR lodged

In a related development, Rajeev Kumar ‘Abhishek’, national vice-president of the Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Mahasabha, lodged an FIR on Tuesday against Magsaysay Award winner Sandeep Pandey for allegedly making inappropriate comments against Veer Savarkar during his lecture against CAA-NRC in AMU.

He has been booked under Section 153 (provocation with the intent of causing riots) and 505 (1)(b) (intent to cause fear among the public).

Hamza Malik, a representative of the Resident Doctors’ Association, which organised the lecture on Sunday, said, “Mr. Pandey did not make any personal comment on Savarkar. He only said what is there in public domain for years.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4klaid/article30618372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200121-WA0045,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amu-v-cs-wife-reaches-out-to-protesting-students/article30618373.ece
66,2020/01/21,"Kapil Sibal calls Modi, Shah for debate on CAA","Former Law Minister Kapil Sibal on Tuesday challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah to an open debate on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), accused them of “lying” on the newly amended citizenship law and described them as a “drag on democracy”.

At a press conference at Congress headquarters, Mr. Sibal said the government had told nine lies with regard to the CAA, the proposed nation-wide National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register (NPR).

“Neither the Constitution nor the citizenship law talks about religion being a criterion for granting citizenship. This is happening for the first time. This is the first lie,” said Mr. Sibal who cited eight other instances where the government’s claims have been contradicted by the facts.

He also referred to the Prime Minister’s speech at Delhi’s Ram Lila Maidan on December 22 in which he had claimed that his government never discussed NRC.

“On June 20 last year, President of India in his address to the joint session of Parliament said that the government has decided to implement the NRC on a priority basis in areas affected by infiltrators,”Mr Sibal said.

Referring to IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath’s comment that the Indian economy was being a drag on global economy, Mr. Sibal said,“So, our growth is a drag on the global economy, the actions of Prime Minister and the Home Minister are a drag on democracy — that is the reality of India”.

He alleged that the Centre was only busy destabilising Opposition governments and replacing them with BJP governments in States and welcomed the Supreme Court’s order that disqualification petitions against lawmakers should be decided within a time frame.

“No Speaker can delay deciding a matter and the delay cannot be more than three months...This means that the Tamil Nadu Assembly also, where speaker has not decided, will have to decide within three months. It also means that in many other States, where people have moved from one party to another partyand against whom disqualification petitions are pending including Goa, will have to decide these matters in the next three months.This will change the political scenario of India,”asserted the Congress leader.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2fiq8u/article30618397.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI10192019000071B-21jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kapil-sibal-calls-modi-shah-for-debate-on-caa/article30618322.ece
67,2020/01/21,"Article 370 became otiose after 1957 dissolution, argues senior advocate Dinesh Dwivedi","Senior advocate Dinesh Dwivedi on Tuesday argued before a Constitution Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana that Article 370 of the Constitution became otiose after the Jammu and Kashmir Constituent Assembly dissolved in 1957.

Thus the executive orders of the Centre over the years, including the August 5, 2019 one abrogating the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, are invalid.

Mr. Dwivedi explained that the “temporary” provision of Article 370 was the “tunnel” connecting the Indian Constitution with Jammu and Kashmir.

Article 370 required the Centre to take the prior concurrence of the J&K Constituent Assembly, which, however, dissolved in 1957 after framing J&K Constitution. Article 370 has since remained frozen in time and cannot form the basis of the August 5 notification which blunted the special status and privileges enjoyed by J&K. Parliament, shortly thereafter, reorganised the full-fledged State of J&K into the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, bringing it directly under the administrative control of the Centre.

‘Live and let live’

Mr. Dwivedi argued that the very reason for grant of special status to J&K was the idea of “live and let live.”

The separate Constitution framed by the J&K Constituent Assembly was not a “creature of the Indian Constitution.” “It is not a derivative of the Indian Constitution. J&K Constitution draws its power from the sovereign,” Mr. Dwivedi argued.

Wide canvas

“With J&K, the federal concept was kept flexible and this was allowed in the Indian Constitution, which provided a wide canvas allowing us to operate on it in whichever manner possible,” Mr. Dwivedi submitted.

The J&K State Constituent Assembly had ceased to exist in January 1957 with the coming of the J&K Constitution. Before it was disbanded in 1957, the Constituent Assembly did not take a decision in favour of abrogation of Article 370 — the constitutional provision which is the fountainhead for the special status and privileges granted to J&K in accordance with the Instrument of Accession.

The proviso to Article 370 (3) required that a recommendation for any change in the special status and privileges accorded to the State of J&K should originally come from the Constituent Assembly. The President could not have issued the August 5 notification, which made irreversible changes in the character of the State.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/40zkni/article27211594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Supreme-Court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article-370-became-otiose-after-1957-dissolution-argues-senior-advocate-dinesh-dwivedi/article30618253.ece
68,2020/01/21,Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi begins Centre’s Kashmir outreach,"Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Tuesday became the first Union Minister to visit the Kashmir valley as part of the Centre’s outreach programme following the August 5 decision to end J&K’s autonomous status, and chose the underdeveloped pocket of Dara in Srinagar’s Harwan to kick-start the tour.

Amid snowfall, Mr. Naqvi addressed a gathering of about 300 people, most of them residents of the under-developed hilly pocket of Dara. To connect with the people, he promised that the Haj quota for locals would be raised and asserted that the ‘change being witnessed’ in mainland India “will be reflected in J&K too”.

“It is the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that J&K too joins the development trajectory of the country. It was the termite of corruption that destroyed this paradise, with people only pursuing their personal gains. For decades, aspirations of locals have been ignored. However, the Centre is for positive and effective change on the ground,” said Mr. Naqvi.

Observing that more than 2 lakh pilgrims go on the Haj every year from India, he said, “we ensure all the facilities are available to the Hajis”. “To ensure transparency, India is the first country to digitise details of the journey of pilgrims,” he added.

The Minister quoted poet Muhammad Iqbal as he chose to ignore the criticism that only eight tours by five Union Ministers had been scheduled for the Kashmir valley compared with 52 tours and public interactions by 31 Ministers in the Jammu region, where the BJP had garnered a significant vote share in the previous parliamentary polls.

“Sitaron se aage jahan aur bhi hain, Abhi waqt kay imtihaan aur bhi hai [Treat my visit as just a small beginning],” said Mr. Naqvi.

The Centre, he said, wanted a ‘new dawn of development and accountability’ in the functioning of the government machinery in J&K following the reading down of Article 370.

During his Srinagar tour, the Union Minister virtually inaugurated a bridge over the river Jhelum at Malroo, built at a cost of ₹16.53 crore, a forest protection force for the 1,223.69 sqm tract at Bemina, at a cost of ₹6.62 crore, and laid the foundation for a high school building at Dara, coming up at a cost of ₹97.01 lakh.

The Minister also toured the Dal Lake and interacted with members of the boatmen community. He heard their demands and assured them that the Centre was working on various fronts to promote tourism in Kashmir.

Residents of Gujjar Basti used the meeting to demand accountability for the funds released by the Centre and implementation of the Forest Act. A delegation of Gujjar youth of Kashmir demanded that the ‘Gojri’ language be included in the 8th schedule, and sought political reservation in the State. They also demanded that a Tribal Research Centre be set up in Kashmir University along the pattern of the facility at Jammu University.

69,2020/01/21,BJP leader Birender Singh resigns from Rajya Sabha,"Former Union Minister and BJP leader Birender Singh resigned his Rajya Sabha membership, according to an official notification issued on Tuesday.

Mr. Singh was nominated from Haryana and his membership is due to end on August 1, 2022. He was elected to the Upper House for the third time on August 2, 2016.

70,2020/01/21,Assamese or Kachari debate rages in Assam,"Almost 35 years since the signing of the Assam Accord, the question of who qualifies as ‘indigenous’ under Clause 6 of the accord — the Assamese or the “more primitive” Kachari — still remains an unresolved question. And with a high-level committee slated to submit its recommendations to the Centre to enable implementation of this clause according constitutional rights for the indigenous peoples of Assam, various organisations in the State are debating the issue with added urgency.

The Assam Public Works (APW), whose petition in the Supreme Court led to the exercise of updating the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the State, has suggested that people who settled in Assam before January 26, 1951, and their descendants be regarded as ‘indigenous’ Assamese. It has also sought the tag for tribes, castes and communities living in the State since 1826 when Assam came under British rule.

Some academics consider the Assamese language-speaking people and all other communities — tribal and non-tribal — living in Assam as the Assamese race. Most tribes, specifically those belonging to the Kachari group, disagree and view the Assamese speakers as non-original inhabitants of Assam.

The Kachari group includes the Bodos, the largest plains tribe of the northeast, the Dimasas and the Sonowal Kachari, the community to which Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal belongs.

“The constitutional safeguard should ideally be for the Kachari people of Assam, not the Assamese, and we have made this clear to the Centre,” the All Assam Kochari Samaj (AAKS) said in a statement on Monday. “The Clause 6 committee is a big conspiracy to destroy the race, land, hearth and language of the Kacharis, the real sons-of-the-soil in Assam,” the Samaj added.

The APW, however, cited a book published by the Assam Sahitya Sabha, which attempts to define the “Assamese”, to come up with its suggestions.

“According to the relevant provisions of Constitution of India, persons who settled in Assam before July 19, 1948, and their descendants are Indians,” the APW asserted. “Hence, the persons having Nepali, Bangladeshi, European and Chinese origin living in Assam prior to July 19, 1948, and their descendants are Assamese,” the organisation added.

“According to the relevant provisions of Constitution, a person who registered his name in the 1951 NRC after settling in Assam and his descendants are also Assamese,” the APW said, suggesting 90% of seats in Parliament, Assembly and local bodies should be reserved for people who have been living in Assam before January 1951 and the remaining 10% for those who came later.

There have been several attempts to define “Assamese” since the Assam Accord of August 1985 that ended a six-year agitation seeking a State free of illegal migrants. Clause 6 of the Accord says: “Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.”

But AAKS working president Manas Rabha asserted that history had been distorted to seek for the Assamese what the Kachari people deserved. “That government and private institutions in Assam have over the years tried to erase the history of the Kachari kings is the bitter truth,” contended Mr. Rabha. “History can be distorted, but not changed,” he said, demanding that 50% of the State’s seats in the Parliament and in the Assembly be reserved for the Kacharis and that Assam’s administrative capital Dispur be renamed as Mahiranga, in memory of the first Kachari king.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/assamese-or-kachari-debate-rages-in-assam/article30617190.ece
71,2020/01/21,Amit Shah’s remarks on CAA show intolerance: Akhilesh Yadav,"Reacting to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement that the CAA will not be withdrawn, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday said it reflected intolerance as the BJP “wants to crush people with the road roller of its majority“.

Lashing out at the BJP, the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said the saffron party is making “intolerance” as its identity.

“Playing with basic principles of the democracy, the BJP is going ahead with making intolerance its identify. Mr. Shah’s statement that he would implement the CAA at any cost shows that the government wants to crush people with the road roller of its majority,” Mr. Yadav said in a statement here.

Akhilesh also claimed that the BJP was getting unpopular due to “anti-people policies”.

“Due to its anti-people policies, the BJP is becoming unpopular among people. Protests are going on in the entire coutry against the CAA and the NRC due to which BJP has focused on janjagran rallies and such programmes,” he said.

The SP chief said Mr. Shah’s address in Lucknow “showed his frustration” over this and his party would not let the BJP-RSS agenda run in the country.

He alleged that BJP leaders have ignored people’s interest and aspirations due to their ego and pride.

Citing a report, he said 16 lakh jobs in the country are going to end in 2016.

As per the National Crime Records Bureau, 35 unemployed and 36 self-employed persons committed suicide per day in 2018, he said.

“In both categories, 26,085 people lost their lives. In the country, 1,34,516 persons hanged themsleves, which included 10,346 from the farming sectors,” he claimed.

The BJP does not have intentions to solve the problems of people and that is why it has brought the CAA to divert attention of people, he claimed.

72,2020/01/21,India in talks to be part of East Asian Observatories Consortium,"India is in preliminary discussions to be a part of the East Asian Observatories Consortium of eight countries committed to build large telescopes and pool resources. There have been no talks with India’s Science and Technology department so far but organisations such as the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, which is part of several mega-science collaborations, have had talks with scientists from member organisations.

Having India join the group, which now consists of China, Japan, Taiwan, Korea as full members and Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia as ‘observers’, could mean the establishment of new kinds of telescopes — one proposed being in Tibet — that could aid the observation of new black holes and throw light on cosmic phenomena.

“We’ve been in talks and there’s no proposal yet. However, the next decade of science will see India play a major role,” said Paul Ho, Director General, East Asian Observatory. Mr. Ho was a Board Member of the Event Horizon Telescope that last year reported the first ever image of a black hole.

A prevalent practice in astronomy is to link the observations from multiple telescopes to spot the signatures of space objects such as black-holes, which are mysterious cosmic sinkholes that trap even light and with its enormous weight distort the space and matter around it and even, some believe, birth of new stars and universes.

Observing the black hole at the centre of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster, required the combining of the capabilities of eight massive telescopes around the world.

“We’ve had visits and discussion,” Eswar Reddy, Professor, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru. “It would be great if India joined as we could defray costs of future telescopes being proposed in India.”

One of them is a 10-metre diameter optical telescope in Hanle, Ladakh that could cost ₹3,000 crore but is still in early stages of consideration by the Indian government. Mr. Ho said another ambitious proposal being considered is a radio telescope (which is sensitive to radiowaves) in Tibet. “The EHT is in the Western Hemisphere. We could have one in the Eastern, with increased sensitivity, and one that connects to the Greenland Telescope and one in Hawaii and make our own observations. India could be a key part of this.”

The scientists are in the city as part of the Vigyan Samagam, a travelling exhibition that shows India’s participation in major science projects around the world.

74,2020/01/21,JD(U)’s Pawan Varma questions tie-up with BJP in Delhi polls,"Ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, for which Bihar’s ruling Janata Dal (United) has struck an alliance with the BJP to contest in two (Burari and Sangam Vihar) out of 70 seats, JD(U) leader and national spokesperson Pawan Varma on Tuesday wrote a letter to party president and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, asking for his “ideological clarity” on the pact with the BJP beyond Bihar, “especially at a time when the BJP, through the CAA-NPR-NRC combine, has embarked on a massive socially divisive agenda” aimed at mutilating the peace, harmony and stability of the country”.

“This is the first time that we will be broadening and extending our party’s association with the BJP through a formal electoral alliance, beyond Bihar… I am deeply perplexed by this development and look to you for ideological clarity”, Mr. Varma, who is also the national general secretary of the JD(U), wrote in his two-page letter.

Earlier, the JD(U) had announced it would contest all 70 seats in the Delhi polls.

Nitish’s ‘confession’

Mr. Varma reminded Mr. Kumar of his confession to him on more than one occasion about his “grave apprehensions” on the BJP-RSS combine. “In my first meeting with you in Patna in August 2012, you had spoken to me at length and with conviction on why Narendra Modi and his policies are inimical for the country”, wrote Mr. Varma. “When you were leading the ‘Mahagathbandhan’, you had openly made a call for RSS Mukt Bharat…these views articulated for a sustained period are a matter of public record”.

Mr. Varma earlier too had written a letter to Mr. Kumar, urging him not to support the CAA, the NRC and the NPR.

Party sources told The Hindu that both Mr. Varma and another leader, Prashant Kishor, had fallen out of Mr. Kumar’s proximity and were leaving no opportunity to put him (Mr. Kumar) and his party in an embarrassing situation on some issue or the other.

Both are not in the list of 20-star campaigners of the JD(U) for the Delhi elections.

Mr. Varma further said in his letter:

“I remember your confession to me in private how the current leadership in BJP party has humiliated you. You maintained on more than one occasion, that the BJP is leading India into a ‘dangerous space’. The BJP is destroying institutions and that there is a need for democratic and socialist forces within the country to regroup, a task for which you actually assigned a senior party official.

“If these are your real views, I fail to understand how the JD(U) is now extending its alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar when even long-standing allies of the BJP like the Akali Dal have refused to do so.

“In view of the above, I think there is an urgent need for the JD(U) to harmonize what the party’s constitution says, what the leader of the party feels in private, and what action the party takes in public…politics, as you have emphasised to us, must be about principle and the courage of conviction. I look forward to receiving some ideological clarity from you, either in a formal meeting of the JD(U) or through such means as you consider best”.

Refutes speculations

Mr. Varma reached Patna on Tuesday to participate in a function and refuted the speculations that he was going to join the Congress. When asked if he would Mr. Kumar, he said: “Why not? He is my party boss and if he would like to meet me and invite, I’ll certainly meet him”.

State JD(U) president Basistha Narayan Singh said he doesn’t want to make any comment on Mr. Varma’s letter. “What’s wrong if our party, which is in alliance with the BJP in Bihar, has struck an electoral alliance with them in Delhi?”, he said.

Senior State Congress leader and party MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said, “I must congratulate Mr. Varma for his audacity to show a mirror to Nitish Kumar who has been making turnarounds on several occasions for his political survival”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mmass4/article30616119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-JDU-PAVANVARMA-ROHITJAINPARAS-3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pavan-varma-shoots-off-missive-to-nitish-questions-jdus-tie-up-with-bjp-in-delhi/article30616120.ece

76,2020/01/21,Two security personnel killed in Pulwama,"Two security personnel — a solider and a policeman — were killed and another was injured during an anti-militancy operation in south Kashmir’s Pulwama on Tuesday.

An official said the gunfight erupted when a joint team of the police’s Special Operations Group and the Army launched a search operation in Awantipora’s Khrew in Pulwama district, following a tip-off about the presence of a group of armed militants.

A small village Zantrag, located close to a forest area, was being surrounded by the security forces when the hiding militants opened indiscriminate fire from a built-up area. “A soldier and a policeman died as they were being shifted to a local hospital,” the official said.

Security forces launched a massive combing operation in the area. “The operation is still on. The area is being searched for militants’ bodies,” police said.

The encounter took place just a day after J&K Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh said the security forces “were on the verge of wiping out the Hizbul Mujahideen” in south Kashmir.

According to official figures, eight militants have been killed in stepped up operations in Kashmir this month.

77,2020/01/21,Private airports’ body opposes reduction in duty-free allowances,"The Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) has vehemently opposed the government’s possible move to reduce liquor allowance and do away with the import of cigarettes.

Reacting to reports that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI) has recommended a reduction in per passenger allowance of import of liquor on arrival at duty-free stores in all Indian airports, along with a complete ban on sale of cigarettes through duty-free stores, APAO on Tuesday said that such a move “will have disastrous effects on the Indian aviation industry across all stakeholders, including airports, airlines, passengers and duty-free operators”.

Estimated losses

The APAO said revenue losses at all airports was estimated at ₹650 crore per annum with an increase in aeronautical charges of around ₹200 crore per annum, which would lead to higher air ticket prices.

With an estimated annual loss to AAI of ₹330 crore and the loss of around 8,000-10,000 jobs, the revenue losses at airports, APAO said, would impact airport operators’ financial ratings, and consequently hamper expansion plans. It anticipates layoffs in the sales force, logistics, warehousing, transportation, shipping and finance.

The APAO has seven members — Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru; Cochin International Airport Limited; Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL); Goa International Airport; Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Hyderabad; Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai (MIAL); and the Navi Mumbai International Airport.

“The APAO has vehemently opposed the proposed move to reduce liquor allowance from two litres to one litre, and to do away with the import of cigarettes that is presently one carton of 100 sticks,” the private airports body, which had in fact in its Budget proposal sent to the government in December suggested an increase of the allowance to four litres of alcohol per passenger, said.

‘Aviation ecosystem hit’

According to the APAO, the changes recommended by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MoCI)will harm the entire aviation ecosystem comprising of airports, airlines, duty-free operators and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and does not help in any way in improvement in the balance of payments.

“The same Ministry is recommending reduction in the import duty on gold to mitigate illegal imports. With the same logic, the proposal will enhance smuggling of imported liquor and encourage passengers to buy more at departure airports globally, resulting in higher foreign exchange outflow,” the APAO said.

The APAO’s secretary-general Satyan Nair observed that the restrictions on liquor and cigarette sales at Indian duty-free outlets will induce passengers to buy liquor and cigarettes from foreign countries, and the shift in buying from foreign airports shall “kill the Indian duty-free industry”.

“At the same time, the restrictions will act as incentive for the import of these goods through illicit channels and will result in a Herculean task for Customs authorities to check each and every passenger, resulting in a shift in focus from checking contraband, imported gold, narcotics, etc., to [checking for] liquor,” Mr. Nair said.

Non-aeronautical revenues

The APAO secretary-general said that, typically, passenger charges alone are never sufficient to cover the cost of developing and operating airports, and it is non-aeronautical revenue streams such as duty-free which subsidise these costs.

The APAO pointed out that at most Indian airports, duty-free revenues make up 15%-20% of the total non-aeronautical revenues, and sales of liquor and cigarettes together account for over 75%-80% of the overall duty-free sales. To make up the revenue loss on account of these new restrictions, the aeronautical charges will have to increase, which will have to be borne by airlines and passengers.

The APAO said it estimated that the aeronautical charges will go up by at least around ₹200 crore annually across India, which will have an impact on ticket prices and may even impact the growth in passenger traffic, which is “already extremely subdued”.

Impact on AAI

“The reduction of duty-free allowance will also adversely impact the Airports Authority of India, which will not only lose revenue from the airports it operates, but also its revenue share from the Delhi and Mumbai airports. It is estimated that the AAI would lose over ₹330 crore — ₹180 crore from its operations and ₹150 crore due to reduction in revenue share payments from DIAL and MIAL. This will reduce the AAI’s ability to develop airports in remote and rural areas, and upgrade airport infrastructure and regional connectivity,” Mr. Nair said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/private-airports-body-opposes-reduction-in-duty-free-allowances/article30615879.ece

79,2020/01/21,Rajiv Gandhi assassination: SC wants to know T.N.’s position on convict’s mercy plea,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Tamil Nadu government to inform whether a decision has been taken by it on a mercy petition of a convict in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

The court also pulled up the Centre for filing a similar status report on a probe done by a CBI-led Multi Disciplinary Monitoring Agency (MDMA) into unravelling a larger conspiracy behind the killing of the former Prime Minister.

A bench of Justices L Nageswara Rao and Deepak Gupta asked the State government to inform the court about the decision taken by it under Article 161 of the Constitution.

The Article gives a governor the power to pardon a person who has been proved guilty in court.

The top court was hearing the plea of 46-year-old A.G. Perarivalan, who has sought suspension of his life sentence in the case till the MDMA’s probe is completed.

Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Perarivalan, said though the State has taken a decision on his mercy petition, his application is pending with the governor.

The MDMA was set up in 1998 on the recommendations of the Justice M C Jain Commission of Inquiry which had probed the conspiracy aspect of Mr. Gandhi’s assassination.

It is headed by a CBI official and comprises officers from the Intelligence Bureau (IB), the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and the Revenue Intelligence, among other agencies.

The top court told the Centre: “Can you tell us what the difference (is) between the status report filed in April 2018 and November 2019. There is no difference at all. We have gone through all of your status reports filed in the case,” it said.

Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand, appearing for the Centre, said the government has not received any response to the letters rogatory (LR) sent to Sri Lanka and other countries.

The Supreme Court had on January 14, expressed its displeasure over the latest status report filed by the MDMA on its probe.

It said it wanted to know about the progress made in the ongoing investigation in the past two years.

On November 5 last year, the Supreme Court had sought within four weeks a latest status report from the MDMA.

It had said the latest report should also include the status of letters rogatory (LRs).

Perarivalan’s counsel had earlier said his role was only limited to procuring nine-volt batteries, which were allegedly used in the improvised explosive device (IED) that had killed Mr. Gandhi.

On March 14 last year, the Supreme Court had asked the MDMA to file a status report with regard to a LR sent to Sri Lanka for examining one of the accused, Nixon alias Suren, who is lodged in the Colombo jail.

The top court had dismissed a plea of Perarivalan seeking recall of the May 11, 1999, verdict upholding his conviction.

It had said the material brought on record before it does not inspire confidence to interfere with the verdict in which Perarivalan and three others were initially awarded death sentence, which was later commuted to life term.

The CBI had earlier submitted that Perarivalan had even visited Jaffna in Sri Lanka in the first week of June 1990, besides attending a public meeting along with other conspirators which was addressed by former Prime Minister V P Singh on May 7, 1991 in Tamil Nadu.

Perarivalan’s counsel had submitted that he was just a 19-year-old when the incident took place and had no knowledge of what he was doing and for what purpose the batteries were purchased.

Mr. Gandhi was assassinated on the night of May 21, 1991 at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu by a woman suicide bomber, identified as Dhanu, at a poll rally.

Fourteen others, including Dhanu herself, were also killed. Mr. Gandhi’s assassination was perhaps the first case of suicide bombing which had claimed the life of a high-profile leader.

In its May 1999 order, the top court had upheld the death sentence of four convicts — Perarivalan, Murugan, Santham and Nalini — in the assassination case.

In April 2000, the Tamil Nadu governor had commuted the death sentence of Nalini on the basis of the State government’s recommendation and an appeal by former Congress president and Rajiv Gandhi’s widow Sonia Gandhi.

On February 18, 2014, the top court had commuted the death sentence of Perarivalan to life imprisonment, along with that of two other prisoners - Santhan and Murugan - on grounds of a delay of 11 years in deciding their mercy pleas by the Centre.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/josjuc/article30615709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THTHESUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-sc-wants-to-know-tns-position-on-convicts-mercy-plea/article30615710.ece

81,2020/01/21,President Jair Bolsonaro will begin four-day visit to India from Friday,"Brazilian President Jair Messias Bolsonaro will on Friday begin a four-day visit to India, primarily as Chief Guest on Republic Day and to explore ways to boost trade ties at a time both large economies were hit by slowdowns.

On his first visit to India after assuming power, Mr. Bolsonaro will be accompanied by seven ministers, top officials and a large business delegation. “President of Brazil Jair Messias Bolsonaro will be paying a State visit to India from January 24-27 at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He will be the Chief Guest at India’s 71st Republic Day Parade on January 26,” the External Affairs Ministry said.

President Bolsonaro, a former army captain, won a landslide victory in Brazil’s presidential election in October 2018 and took the reins of the country in January last year. “This visit is expected to further enhance and strengthen the multi-faceted ties between India and Brazil,” the Ministry said.

The last Presidential visit from Brazil was by President Michel Temer in October 2016 on the sidelines of the eighth BRICS Summit in Goa. Mr. Modi visited Brazil in November to attend the XI BRICS Summit.

Presidential banquet

Brazilian Presidents have presided over the Republic Day Parades in 1996 and 2004. On Saturday, President Ram Nath Kovind will hold talks with Mr. Bolsonaro and will also host a banquet for him. Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will also call on the Brazilian leader.

On January 27, Mr. Bolsonaro will address a group of Indian and Brazilian business leaders at the India-Brazil Business Forum, according to the MEA. India-Brazil ties have been on an upswing in the last few years. The volume of bilateral trade was $8.2 billion in 2018-19. This included $3.8 billion worth of Indian exports to Brazil and $4.4 million as imports by India. Both governments feel there is huge potential to enhance the bilateral trade further.

“Both sides will focus on boosting trade and investment during the visit,” said an official. Major Indian exports to Brazil include agro-chemicals, synthetic yarns, auto components and parts, pharmaceuticals and petroleum products. Brazilian exports to India include crude oil, gold, vegetable oil, sugar and bulk mineral and ores.

Indian investments in Brazil were around $6 billion and Brazilian investments in India are estimated at $1 billion in 2018. Brazilian investments in India are mainly in automobiles, IT, mining, energy and biofuels sectors. India has invested in Brazil’s IT, pharmaceutical, energy, agri-business, mining and engineering sectors.

“Our bilateral relations are based on a common global vision, shared democratic values, and a commitment to foster economic growth of both countries,” the MEA said. Bilateral ties were elevated to a strategic partnership in 2006, heralding a new phase in India-Brazil relations. “The relations are strong not only at the bilateral level, but also at pluri-lateral fora such as BRICS, IBSA, G-20 and in multilateral bodies particularly the UN,” the MEA said.

Both the countries were also strong contenders for permanent membership of the U.N. Security Council.

82,2020/01/21,"Fee hike demands met, calls for JNU VC’s removal now unreasonable: HRD Minister","Calls for the removal of JNU Vice Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar are now not reasonable as the basic demand of students on hostel fee hike has been met, says Union Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’

The situation in the university is turning normal and students who want to study should not be disturbed, the minister told PTI in an interview.

Last year in October, the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) administration announced a hike in hostel fee, including introduction of service and utility charges.

Following this, students took to streets demanding a roll back, prompting the Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry to form a three-member panel to mediate between the agitating students and the administration to restore normalcy in the campus.

“The basic demand of students about the hostel fee hike has been met. The calls for JNU VC’s removal now are not reasonable, removing anybody is not the solution,” Mr. Pokhriyal said.

After a series of meetings with the JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) and the varsity administration, the ministry had directed the University Grants Commission (UGC) to fund the utility and service charge, and appealed to the students to call off their agitation.

On the JNUSU’s decision to move court against amendments in the hostel manual, including the fee hike, and continue its boycott of the semester registration process, Mr. Pokhriyal said, “It is the university’s call on what to do next”.

“I have been told that over 80% students have already registered for the winter semester and more people are registering,” he said, adding that “if our universities have to excel in the global competition, we need to rise above these issues.”

The Students’ Union on Tuesday moved the Delhi High Court challenging the inter-hostel administration’s decision on amending the hostel manual, saying the amendment is “malafide, arbitrary and illegal”, and adversely affects students.

The academic issue has been resolved, the situation is turning normal at the university, and as far as the violence case is concerned, police are investigating it, Mr. Pokhriyal said.

Early this month, the university had witnessed a tussle between student groups over the issue of semester registration. On January 5, masked men had gone on a rampage inside the campus assaulting students and teachers, and storming hostels, drawing widespread outrage.

Mr. Pokhriyal said students should start studying because there is no issue now and time should not be wasted. JNU is a prestigious university, “we want to ensure an atmosphere for students to excel”, he said.

As clamour grew for Jagadesh Kumar’s removal following hostel fee hike and the January 5 violence, the ministry had ruled out sacking him, saying the government’s focus is to address the main issues that have cropped up on the campus.

The minister reiterated that universities will not be allowed to turn into battlefields.

“We don’t want anarchy in universities, we want conducive environment for academics. Our students are going places, we are investing more and more in research with an aim to take our universities and academic institutions among top rankers globally. Let’s move forward in that way,” he said.

Asserting that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is not aimed at taking away anybody’s citizenship, Mr. Pokhriyal appealed to students “to explain this to those misleading the public on the issue and indulging in petty politics”.

“The CAA is to give citizenship to those with Indian roots, it is not aimed at taking away anybody’s citizenship. I appeal to students, who are the future of the country, to explain this to those who are misleading the public on the issue and doing petty politics,” he said.

“Because myths are being spread about the law, the image of the country is being harmed as well as damage to public property. The students can play a role in clearing this air,” the minister added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bzpbpy/article30615461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THRAMESHPOKHRIYAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fee-hike-demands-met-calls-for-jnu-vcs-removal-now-unreasonable-hrd-minister/article30615462.ece
83,2020/01/21,SC again highlights taking away disqualification power from Speakers,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked Parliament to amend the Constitution to strip Legislative Assembly Speakers of their exclusive power to decide whether legislators should be disqualified or not under the anti-defection law.

An independent tribunal ought to be appointed instead to determine the fate of an MP or an MLA who has switched sides for money and power, it said.

This is the second time in as many months the court has highlighted the issue of taking away the disqualification power under the Tenth Schedule from Speakers. In a 109-page judgment by a three-judge Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana in the Karnataka MLAs’ disqualification case, the court had held that a Speaker who cannot stay aloof from the pressures and wishes of his political party does not deserve to occupy his chair. This judgment of November last, also urged Parliament to “reconsider strengthening certain aspects of the Tenth Schedule, so that such undemocratic practices are discouraged”.

On Tuesday, in a 31-page judgment, a three-judge Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman questioned why a Speaker, who is a member of a particular political party and an insider in the House, should be the “sole and final arbiter” in the disqualification of a political defector. “It is time Parliament had a rethink on whether disqualification petitions ought to be entrusted to a Speaker as a quasi-judicial authority when such Speaker continues to belong to a particular political party either de jure or de facto,” the court said.

For that matter, it asked why disqualification proceedings under the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) should be kept in-house and not be given to an “outside” authority. Even the final authority for removal of a judge is outside the judiciary and in Parliament, it reasoned.

Disqualification petitions under the Tenth Schedule should be adjudicated by a mechanism outside Parliament or the Legislative Assemblies. The court suggested a permanent tribunal headed by a retired Supreme Court judge or a former High Court Chief Justice.

Only swift and impartial disqualification of defectors would give “real teeth” to the Tenth Schedule, Justice Nariman wrote in the judgment for the Bench, also comprising Justices Aniruddha Bose and V. Ramasubramanian. The anti-defection law was enacted in 1985 to weed out corruption and money power from politics. A person who had incurred disqualification for defection does not deserve to be an MP or an MLA even for a single day, Justice Nariman observed.

However, for the present, the court said the Speakers should decide Tenth Schedule disqualifications within a “reasonable period”. What was ‘reasonable’ would depend on the facts of each case. Unless there were “exceptional circumstances”, disqualification petitions under the Tenth Schedule should be decided by Speakers within three months. The courtnoyed that this period was ‘reasonable’, as the ordinary life of the Lok Sabha or the Legislative Assemblies was merely five years.

The Tuesday judgment came on an appeal filed by Congress legislator Keisham Meghchandra Singh against the Manipur Assembly Speaker for the disqualification of Minister T. Shyamkumar, who after contesting in the Congress ticket, switched sides to favour the BJP.

The court asked the State Assembly Speaker to decide the disqualification petition in four weeks. The petitioners were given liberty to approach the Supreme Court in case the Speaker failed to comply.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4298nv/article30537200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-asks-parliament-to-rethink-powers-of-the-speaker-in-disqualification-of-ministers/article30615269.ece
84,2020/01/21,"Analysis | Sibal, Khurshid’s mistimed comments on citizenship law weaken Congress’ position","In politics, like cricket, timing is an art form only a few can practice to perfection. And as in cricket, a mistimed shot or comment can do immense damage.

For the Congress party that is now trying to take the lead in fighting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), former Law Minister Kapil Sibal’s statement that States cannot refuse to implement the CAA would fall in such a category.

To make matters worse, Mr. Sibal was joined by fellow Congressman Salman Khurshid in stating that the States will have to obey the law if the Supreme Court does not intervene.

Round won

Mr. Sibal clarified that he believed the granting of citizenship on the basis of religion was “unconstitutional” and that the fight must go on. But if politics is about perception, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had won this round.

Leaders of the ruling party, who usually don’t spare an opportunity to attack Mr. Sibal for his “zero loss” comment on the presumptive loss figures in 2G spectrum allocation, or for representing a Muslim party in the Ram Janambhoomi title dispute in one hearing, were now citing his legal acumen.

To be fair, neither Mr. Sibal nor Mr. Khurshid have said anything that can be challenged on facts. Without getting into too many technical details, it is worth pointing out that several Articles in our Constitution make it clear that a Central law prevails over State law in the case of a conflict between laws enacted by the Parliament and the State Assemblies.

In the case of Central subjects, or the Union List, Parliament’s authority is supreme. And citizenship is a Central subject.

‘Tricky issue’

The only role that a State government will play would be to conduct police verification of applicants as Law and Order is a State subject.

This concern was raised by another Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, who pointed out that the issue is “tricky”.

Mr. Ramesh, of course, is among those political leaders who have moved the the Supreme Court to challenge the new citizenship law.

Given the Constitutional scheme of things, all the Congress leaders are right in their assertion that the States may have limited options if the top court does not intervene or if they [the States] don’t want to challenge the Constitutional scheme of things.

But the issue is far beyond the technicalities of law — it is one of politics. It is about challenging the BJP’s dominance and projecting Opposition-ruled States like Kerala and Punjab as pockets of resistance with their passing of anti-CAA resolutions in their Assemblies.

‘Idea of India’

It is also offering leadership to an alternative approach to politics and, as the Congress puts it, their “idea of India”.

Upset with the out-of-turn comments, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi instructed her party to issue a fresh statement.

On Sunday, Congress communications chief, Randeep Surjewala, another lawyer by training, asserted that State governments had a special right under Article 131 to challenge any Central law, and States have approached the courts before.

But these legal technicalities are of minor consequence as the ruling party, which has been facing sustained pressure against the citizenship law for over a month, now has comments from Congress leaders to blunt any attack by the Opposition.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5jik0p/article30381636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CONGRESS-RAJGHAT-KAMALNARANG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-sibal-khurshids-mistimed-comments-on-citizenship-law-weaken-congress-position/article30615219.ece
85,2020/01/21,Bright future awaits J&K after abrogation of Article 370: Kiran Rijiju,"Stating that Article 370 was the “biggest obstacle” in the development of Jammu and Kashmir, Union minister Kiren Rijiju on Tuesday said the future of the Union Territory is bright and its youth can now have a dream to “touch the sky”..

Mr. Rijiju was the part of the latest batch of nearly a dozen Union ministers who reached Jammu on Tuesday on the fourth day of the massive outreach campaign launched by the Centre to disseminate information about the implementation of its policies and programmes for the overall development of Jammu and Kashmir.

“We are here to act like wings for the youth to fulfil their dream, and the central government under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is determined to take the region to the new heights of development and progress,” the Minister of State for Youth Services and Sports said.

Addressing a gathering after dedicating the upgraded indoor stadium to the people here, Mr. Rijiju said the momentum of the developmental activities witnessed “three to four times increase” after the nullification of Article 370.

“The future of Jammu and Kashmir is bright and the younger generation is lucky and can have a dream to touch the sky,” he said.

The Centre had on August 5 last year abrogated Article 370 provisions of the Constitution, which guaranteed special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and bifurcated the State into Union territories.

Mr. Rijiju said Article 370 was the “biggest obstacle and was standing like a wall” in the way of development of Jammu and Kashmir.

“After its abrogation, the speed of development increased by three to four times. If the development continues like this, I believe that Jammu and kashmir will be the most developed region of the country in the near future,” he said.

Mr. Rijiju said he is on a two-day tour of the Union Territory and “will look at how my ministry will contribute in the developmental progress“.

He assured more indoors stadiums for the region and said “we will provide the local sportspersons all facilities and support to make them champions“.

The minister said that had successive governments carried forward “such type of development as it is happening today”, Jammu and Kashmir would have touched great heights.

“Better late than never...Article 370 is gone and the Prime Minister’s development plan for the Union Territory will set an example not only for the country, but the entire world to see,” he said.

Mr. Rijiju said when he was in the Home Ministry, the erstwhile State received the “highest funds” under the leadership of PM Modi.

“Jammu and Kashmir had received so much of funds that nothing like that was provided to any other state of the country. After the erstwhile State came under the governor’s rule (in June 2018), the developmental activities gathered pace,” he said.

“Jammu and kashmir is a very beautiful place with lots of potential. The central government is moving towards with the goal of developing the region. I am in politics for the last 30 years and had not witnessed such type of development within five to six months.

86,2020/01/21,"Protest as you like but CAA will stay, asserts Amit Shah","‘Protest as you like but the Citizenship (Amendment) Act [CAA] will not be withdrawn’, Union Home Minister Amit Shah asserted here on Tuesday.

The debate on the CAA was a “fight” between those who wanted the good of the country and those who wanted to “break the country into pieces,” he said, using the phrase ‘Bharat ke tukde’ to target the CAA critics.

Mr. Shah, who was addressing a rally in support of the CAA, said: “Today I have come to Lucknow to say it aloud that whoever wants to protest, can protest, but the CAA won't be taken back.”

His comment came as a sit-in by women at the Hussainabad Clock Tower hit the fifth day.

Criticises Opposition

Mr. Shah said the Opposition parties were spreading misconceptions about the new law and instigating riots and arson. The Congress was opposed to the CAA and did not want to listen to the cries of the religious minorities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan as it was “blindfolded” by “vote-bank.”

Mr. Shah also hit out at Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, who has been speaking out against the CAA and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC). He said, “Aur Akhilesh Babu, aap zyada na bolo toh accha hai. Kabhi kabhi padha karo, bhaiya. Padhne se faida hota hai. [And Akhilesh babu, it's best you speak less. Try and read sometimes, brother. Reading is beneficial].” He dared Mr. Yadav to come on stage and speak on the CAA “for five minutes”.

Mr. Shah also asked Opposition leaders like Mayawati, Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee to pick any platform for an open debate on the CAA. He said crores of minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan were either killed, forced to convert, had their women “taken away” or chose to take refuge in India.

“Those people who talk of human rights like a fashion today and come out with armbands, I want to ask them, where were your human rights lost when crores of people were killed, converted or forced to take refuge,” he asked.

Mr. Shah said Opposition leaders who are “greedy for vote banks” should visit the camps of these people. “Those who owned 100 hectares of land are today surviving and begging in a small slum with their family.

87,2020/01/21,Eight from Kerala die in Nepal due to possible gas leak at resort,"Tragedy struck a group of 15 tourists from Kerala in Nepal when eight of them, including four minors, died after they fell unconscious probably due to a gas leak from a heater in their room at a mountainous resort, police said, amidst cold wave in the Himalayan region.

The Indian nationals were airlifted to HAMS hospital in Kathmandu where they were pronounced dead on arrival, Superintendent of Police Sushil Singh Rathaur said.

Makwanpur police said the victims might have fallen unconscious due to asphyxiation.

“All eight were airlifted and brought to hospital in Kathmandu. A doctor from the Indian mission was also immediately sent to the concerned hospital to check on welfare of patients and to provide necessary assistance,” sources at the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu said.

“We have now been informed that all eight patients did not survive,” they added.

The victims were identified as Praveen Krishnan Nair, Saranya Sasi, Sreebhadra Praveen, Aarcha Praveen, Abhinav Saranya Nair, Ranjith Kumar Adatholath Punathil, Indu Lakshmi Peethambaran Ragalatha and Vyshnav Ranjith.

The deceased — two couples and four children — were part of a group of 15 people travelling from Kerala to Pokhara, a popular mountainous tourist destination.

They were on their way back home and stayed at Everest Panorama Resort in Daman in Makawanpur district on Monday night.

According to the manager at the resort, the guests stayed in a room and turned on a gas heater to keep themselves warm.

Although they had booked a total of four rooms, eight of them stayed in a room and remaining others in another room, the manager said, adding that all the windows and the door of the room were bolted from inside.

The Indian mission has assured all necessary assistance to the family members of the victims.

88,2020/01/21,JNU students’ union moves court against hostel fee hike,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University Student Union (JNUSU) on Tuesday moved the Delhi High Court challenging the Inter Hostel Administration (IHA) decision amending the hostel manual that, among other issues, increased the hostel fee.

The petition filed by JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh has sought quashing of the minutes of the 283rd meeting of the Executive Council (EC) held on November 13 last year ratifying the IHA decision and the high-level committee of November 25, 2019, making further amendments to the hostel manual.

The petition said the “decisions are malafide, arbitrary and illegal and adversely affect the student community of the University, bringing far-reaching changes to the provisions of the hostel manual”.

The amendments to the manual include an increase in hostel fee, affecting the rights of those in reserved categories vis-à-vis allocation of hostel rooms and also reduce the representation of the JNUSU in the IHA, among several other changes.

The petition pointed out that the minutes of the meeting also stated that mess services, sanitation services, room charges, among other category of charges, will be increased by 10% every academic year from the monsoon semester.

The students’ union further contended that the IHA was held with no student representation, “defeating the mandate of the hostel manual of including the views of the stakeholders when changing the provisions of the manual”.

Subsequent to the amendments, JNUSU and hostel presidents wrote to the JNU administration on various occasions bringing to their attention the illegalities. “However, the University refused to take any action and in fact allowed the ratification of this illegal meeting,” the petition stated.

It had asked the High Court to quash the decisions of the IHA dated and reconvene a fresh IHA as per law.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/70rhiy/article30614401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDEXJNUADMINBLOCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jnu-students-union-moves-court-against-hostel-fee-hike/article30614402.ece

Mr. Sibal’s comments came after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had on Monday lowered India’s economic growth estimate for the current fiscal to 4.8% and listed the country’s much-lower-than-expected GDP numbers as the single-biggest drag on its global growth forecast for two years.

“IMF lowers India’s GDP for 2019 to 4.8%. Calls it a drag on the world economy,” Mr. Sibal tweeted.

“Protests of people, young and old, across India (who can’t be recognised by the clothes they wear) Reflect that the duo Modiji and Amit Shah are a drag on Indian Democracy,” the Congress leader added.

Ahead of the start of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit in Davos, Switzerland, India-born IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath had said growth in the country slowed sharply owing to stress in the non-bank financial sector and weak rural income growth.

Justice M. Sundar, who was hearing the petition by Mr. Karti and his wife seeking to stall the proceedings before the special court constituted to hear cases related to MPs and MLAs, granted an interim injunction till January 27.

The matter relates to the alleged non-disclosure of ₹1.35 crore received by Mr. Karti, son of former union minister P. Chidambaram, and his wife Srinidhi in cash for sale of land at Muttukadu near here.

The lower court, which is proposed to frame charges is restrained from doing so because of the interim stay.

Sharma Oli on Tuesday said bilateral disputes with India should be dealt with dialogue by the majority governments of both countries, indicating Kathmandu’s political willingness to resolve the row over the Kalapani territorial issue with New Delhi.

“The time has come to resolve all pending issues through dialogue in the lasting interest of our two countries. A stable and majority government in both countries is an opportune moment. My government remains committed to working closely with the Government of India towards this end. Our Ministers and respective officials will meet to sort out differences and advance the partnership agenda,” said Mr. Oli over a video-link before the inauguration of the Integrated Check Post at Jogbani-Biratnagar that has been built with Indian assistance.

Row over new map

The Kalapani issue was reignited after India published a new political map in November 2019 that displayed its continued position over the territory as part of Uttarakhand. Following this, protests and comments poured in from the Nepali side, though high-level Nepali diplomats maintained that New Delhi and Kathmandu should resolve the issue through dialogue. In response, India maintained that the political map depicted India’s sovereign territory “accurately”.

Mr. Oli also invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit Kathmandu. He said he looked forward to receiving the Indian leader. Both leaders referred to India’s contribution for the earthquake relief and rebuilding work in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts of Nepal.

expressing satisfaction over the way houses had been built with Indian assistance in Gorkha and Nuwakot districts, Mr. Modi said, “The earthquake of 2015 was a painful incident.

93,2020/01/21,"Supreme Court to hear Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel’s pleas next week","The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear next week the pleas filed by telecom majors Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel for modification of the court’s October 24, 2019 order for payment of dues to the government within three months.

A Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde agreed to list the pleas for an urgent hearing before a Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra.

The telcos have sought the court’s intervention, saying the October direction would spell huge ramifications in the telecom industry and “severely hamper” programmes like Digital India, Make in India and Skill India.

The pleas come shortly after a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court led by Justice Arun Mishra, on January 16, had dismissed petitions filed by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, among others, for a review of its October 2019 judgment upholding the recovery of past dues amounting to ₹1.47 lakh crore from them. The recovery by the government was based on adjusted gross revenue of about ₹92,000 crore.

Vodafone urged the court to alter its order and permit it to submit an application before the Department of Telecom (DoT) for drawing up a schedule for payment of the dues.

The review petitions were rejected by the Bench, also comprising Justices Abdul S. Nazeer and M.R. Shah, in their chambers.

Bharti said the exercise for calculating the amounts due, including past demands, were continuing and would require further interaction with the government as it covered licences across 22 circles and period of over 15 years. Besides, it said all the parties would take time to “reconcile” with the calculations.

“Payment of thousands of crores in due amounts without proper assessment and financial calculations and time for payment will not only cause irreparable damage to the appellants (telcos) but also to the telecom industry at large, leading to possible disruption of a public utility service owing to the bad financial position of the telecom companies,” they appealed.

If unmodified, the October 2019 schedule for payment may risk large-scale job losses, destruction of billions of dollars of capital investments due to bankruptcies and poor financial health and large-scale NPAs. Besides, the impact would have a ripple effects on vendors and retailers. The 5G and future technologies to support Digital India Mission may get “compromised”, the appeals painted a bleak picture.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hqlnyb/article30613111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-TELECOMSAUCTIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-to-hear-vodafone-idea-bharti-airtels-pleas-next-week/article30613112.ece
94,2020/01/21,Make code on pharma firms mandatory: doctors,"The Alliance of Doctors for Ethical Healthcare has demanded that the Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices be made mandatory. “It is unfortunate that even after 5 years the code remains voluntary. This is despite the fact that several medical organisations have demanded this repeatedly from the government,” it said.

The statement comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly warned pharmaceutical companies not to indulge in unethical practices and stop giving freebies to the doctors with a purpose to procure business.

“The global experience also shows that the voluntary code does not work,” noted a statement issued by the group even while pharmaceutical companies have denied that deliberations on this subject occurred in the meeting.

“It may be pointed out here that the companies spend crores of rupees through associations by sponsoring the medical conferences. They spend a huge amount on travel, accommodation and other expenditures on the doctors for lavish arrangements of the conferences,” said the Alliance.

As per law “companies or their associations/representatives are not to extend any hospitality like hotel accommodation to healthcare practitioners and their family members under any pretext.” The implied meaning of this is that even extending benefits to the doctors through associations is unethical. But this is being flouted with impunity, the group noted.

The Medical Council of India (MCI) had amended The Indian Medical Council (Professional conduct, etiquette and ethics) regulation 2002 in its meeting on February 18, 2014 and exempted the “Professional Associations of Doctors” from the purview of Medical Ethics.

“There is urgent need to take steps to reverse this amendment,” said the statement.

They added that since the corporate hospitals are not covered under this regulation, they take advantage and openly flout ethics.

“They should also be brought under the regulation on ethics. It is also equally important that any freebies from the Pharmaceutical companies be made taxable. These were taxable earlier but the decision was reversed later by the Pune Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,” said the Alliance.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/make-code-on-pharma-firms-mandatory-doctors/article30610780.ece

99,2020/01/21,Highest number of foreigners imprisoned in West Bengal,"The National Crime Records Bureau’s Prison Statistics India (PSI) 2018 shows that the highest number of foreign convicts and undertrials held in Indian jails were lodged in West Bengal, with Maharashtra and Delhi following.

Of the 5,168 foreign inmates lodged in various prisons across the country as on December 31, 2018, as many as 2,316 (44.8%) were imprisoned in West Bengal, 587 (11.4%) were held in Maharashtra and 416 (8%) were inmates in Delhi’s jails. While 4,381 prisoners of foreign nationality were males, 787 were females.

“Among these foreign national prisoners, 40.8% (2,108 inmates) were convicts, 50.5% (2,611 inmates) were undertrials and 0.8% (43 inmates) were detenues,” the NCRB said in its report. “However, there were 406 other foreign national inmates lodged in various jails accounting for 7.9% of total foreign national prisoners at the end of 2018,” according to the PSI.

The number of foreigners lodged in West Bengal’s jails after being convicted stood at 1,379, which is 65.4% of all foreign convicts, followed by Uttar Pradesh (130, 6.2%) and Delhi (97, 4.6%).

West Bengal also reported the highest number of foreign undertrials (576, 22.06%), followed by Maharashtra (508, 19.45%) and Delhi (306, 11.7%).

State Minister of Prisons Ujjwal Biswas said that the number of foreign inmates was higher because of West Bengal’s border with Bangladesh. “This is because of the lacunae in guarding the border [by personnel] deployed by the central government that we have high number of foreign inmates in our prisons,” asserted Mr. Biswas. West Bengal shares a 2,216 km border with Bangladesh and those caught illegally entering the country are usually booked under The Foreigners Act, and can be imprisioned for several years.

Asked whether the number of foreign inmates put a burden on resources allocated to prisoners in the State, the Minister asserted that there was an overall decline in the number of prisoners at the State’s correctional facilities and that the situation was improving.

Interestingly, the figures from West Bengal were for the year 2017, with the NCRB pointing out that “due to non-receipt of data from West Bengal for 2018, data furnished for 2017” had been used.

Highest number from Bangladesh

Of the 2,108 foreign convicts lodged in the country’s prisons, the highest number were from Bangladesh. Bangladeshi nationals comprised 68.8% or 1,451 convicts, followed by Nepal (10.6%, 224 convicts) and Pakistan (6.3%,133 convicts).

Among the foreign undertrials too, the highest number were from Bangladesh (40%, 1,044) followed by Nigeria (18.7%, 489) and Nepal (17.6%, 459).

Drop in foreign inmates

The PSI 2018 also reveals a decline in the number of foreign inmates since 2013. “The number of foreigner inmates in the prisons has decreased by 27.9% during 2013-2018 (status as on 31st December of respective years),” the NCRB states. While the number of foreign convicts decreased by 10.4% and that of undertrials shrank by 40%, the number of detenues increased by 4.9%.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/highest-number-of-foreigners-imprisoned-in-west-bengal/article30609214.ece
100,2020/01/21,Odisha village stops use of manja to save birds,"Since 2019, inhabitants of Gunthabandha, a village on the outskirts of Odisha’s Berhampur, have completely discarded the use of abrasive manja thread for kite flying to save sparrows and other birds of their area. They followed the rule this year as well. Thanks to their efforts, along with sparrows, the number of other birds seen near Gunthabandha has also increased.

Volunteers of a youth organisation, Anchalika Vikash Parishad (AVP), have created a model for house sparrow conservation through artificial nests and feeders. Sparrow conservation began in this village in 2013, after the Cyclone Phailin killed most birds of the area. At present, all families of the village shelter sparrow families in artificial nests hung in front of their houses.

Glass powder-coated manja can cut throats and body parts of humans. As the thread does not break easily, a large number of birds are seriously injured and die when they become entangled in manja.

Children bring change

“We realised the danger when we found young sparrow hatchlings injured by the manja kept in our homes. Then we found other birds getting killed by manja,” said AVP’s president Sagar Kumar Patra. According to the secretary of the organisation, Bijendra Majhi, injuries to sparrows caused by manja thread made the children of Gunthabandha unhappy as they consider sparrows their playmates. The children in turn pressed elders and family members to stop the use of manja thread for kite flying.

But kite flying is still a major winter pastime at this village. “Like most youths and children of Gunthabandha, I have not stopped flying kites. But we use plain thread instead of manja so that we don’t harm sparrows and other birds, whom we consider members of our village,” said Kanha Bisoi.

Other villages

AVP has also started motivating the people of other villages to follow similar practices. “The villagers of Adapada in the Sanakhemundi Block and Dhunkapada in the Beguniapada Block have already been successful in checking the use of manja to some extent,” Mr. Patra said.

Since September 2018, the Forest Department, with the help of AVP, has taken up a project to make Ganjam “the first sparrow-friendly district of the State” through use of artificial nests.

102,2020/01/21,Use of electoral bonds for Delhi polls worries activists,"Activists working for electoral reforms said they were disappointed on Monday when the Supreme Court declined to stay the electoral bond scheme of the government, saying that the anonymous donations to political parties through these bonds could continue for the Delhi Assembly elections next month.

A founder of the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), which had filed a plea for stay of the scheme on November 29, 2019, Jagdeep S. Chhokar, said the apex court had asked the Election Commission of India to reply on the stay plea in two weeks.

ECI goes slow

He pointed out that the plea had been filed in November 2019 and the ECI had time since then to give its response. Now, he said, the ADR would continue to push for “early hearing”, given that Delhi elections are on February 8. The Finance Ministry has approved the sale of the 13th tranche of electoral bonds by SBI from January 13 to January 22.

The government’s scheme was meant for Lok Sabha elections, but the sale window for bonds had been opened before State Assembly elections repeatedly, Mr Chhokar said. Under the scheme notified in January 2018, an Indian person or company can buy electoral bonds sold by the State Bank of India and donate to a political party. The identity of the donors are not made public, but the Supreme Court had, in April 2019, asked the parties to give the details of the electoral bonds to the ECI in a sealed cover.

“It is sad that unaccounted money will be used in the Delhi elections,” Mr. Chhokar said.

Lawyer and activist Anjali Bhardwaj said it was “disappointing” that the Supreme Court had not stayed the “opaque electoral bonds scheme”.

“We will now have another election without voters knowing who is funding parties,” she said.

She added that information obtained through the Right to Information has shown that the “government pushed through the scheme despite serious objections raised by the ECI and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)”.

Ms Bhardwaj said the then-RBI Governor Urijit Patel had said the scheme had the risk of “money laundering, forgery and counterfeiting”, adding that the ECI had said it would be “retrograde step for transparency”.

“The information obtained also showed that after holding a briefing with the Prime Minister on the electoral bond scheme, the proposal for seeking views of political parties and members of the public was dropped. More than ₹6,000 crore has been given to political parties through electoral bonds since January 2018 when the scheme was notified. The ruling BJP has been the biggest beneficiary of the scheme so far. The SBI has refused to divulge the names of those who purchased the electoral bonds under the RTI Act.,” she said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/v1r41s/article30054173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th23-Bonds-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/use-of-electoral-bonds-for-delhi-polls-worries-activists/article30608430.ece
103,2020/01/21,U.P. police book Lucknow CAA protesters,"The Uttar Pradesh police have lodged three criminal cases against the protesters, mostly women, demonstrating against the Citizenship Amendment (Act) (CAA) at the Clocktower Park in Lucknow since Friday.

The police have named around two dozen persons in the FIRs, while more than 135 are unidentified protesters. Most of those named in the FIRs are women and include Sumaiya Rana and Fauzia Rana, daughters of Urdu poet Munawwar Rana, a Sahitya Akademi Award winner.

The SHO of Thakurganj police station, where the FIRs were lodged, confirmed to The Hindu that the protesters were booked in three separate cases but no arrests were made yet.

In one of the FIRs, the Rana sisters and others have been booked under Sections 147, 145, 188 and 283 of the IPC. The charges are unlawful assembly, rioting, disobedience to order and causing anger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation.

The case was lodged for dhakka mukki (pushing and shoving) by the protesters against the police on duty, a police officer said.

The FIR, lodged on the complaint of the women constables on duty, alleged that on January 18, the persons named “pushed and shoved them out” of the site when they had gone there to disperse the crowd. The police said the protest gathering was held without any permission and violated the prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Cr.PC.

Ms. Sumaiya Rana condemned the police action and said the government was trying to save its face by booking the protesters.

“There has not been any violence at the protest. Only women and children are protesting,” she told The Hindu. “We are sitting, singing patriotic songs. Slogans of Inquilab Zindabad and ‘Azadi’ from casteism, Manuvad and Fascism are being raised. What crime did we commit,” she asked.

Ms. Rana appeared surprised by the FIRs: ""We are exercising our constitutional right. What can we say, whatever is legal, we will face it,"" she said.

The FIRs have surfaced a day after the UP police was criticized on social media with the hashtag

""Kambal Chor UP Police (Blanket thief, UP police)"" after women protesters holding a sit-in against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act at the Clocktower park accused the police of snatching away their supplies, floorings, food items and blankets in the cold night. The police, however, claimed the blankets were seized following due process of law.

CM’s stand

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday hit out at political parties opposing the CAA, saying they spread negative propaganda to malign the country’s image by “pushing women to the front”. He did not refer to any incident or event. In Lucknow and Prayagraj, protesters, a majority of them women, against the CAA and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens have accused the police of non-cooperation and hostility.

At a rally in support of the CAA in Gorakhpur on Sunday, Mr. Adityanath used the allegory of the disrobing of Draupadi in Mahabharata, to blame the Opposition of trying to “malign” the country’s image globally.

“The Opposition’s act is like the cheer haran. Rashtre ke cheer haran jaisa hai [it is like the disrobing of the nation],” he said.

Mr. Adityanath accused the Opposition of trying to “spoil the atmosphere” in the country through “propaganda” against the nation and by “pushing women to the front”.

‘Send postcards to PM’

At a rally in support of the CAA in Gorakhpur, he urged supporters of the new law “not to remain silent”, and asked them to send postcards to Prime Minister Narendra Modi endorsing it.

He alleged that the Opposition was trying to “mislead people” on the CAA and that the protests against the amended law were part of a “conspiracy” to defame India by those who wanted to “obstruct” the growth of “New India.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/364kxi/article30610074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20TH-THGRP-LUCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/up-police-book-lucknow-caa-protesters/article30610075.ece

The Speaker left the House in a huff, leaving everyone dumbfounded. He did not announce whether it was a break, or an adjournment. The Speaker just removed his collar mike and left saying, “Am protesting the attitude of the TDP MLAs.”

Trouble started as soon as the House assembled at 10 a.m. The TDP MLAs raised slogans such as ‘Save Amaravati’.

Mr. Seetharam, however, conducted the business amidst protests and noisy scenes.

Later, the TDP MLAs went to the Speaker’s podium and raised slogans holding placards. They obstructed the business and engaged themselves in crosstalk with the YSRCP MLAs from the podium.

Repeated requests from the Speaker went in vain.

105,2020/01/21,‘Vidya Kanuka kits for all government school students on June 1’,"Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday announced that all government school students would be given the Vidya Kanuka kit on June 1 much before the reopening of schools on June 12 for the academic year 2020-21.

Intervening in the short discussion on the Amma Vodi scheme in the Assembly, Mr. Jagan said the government was going all out to improve the quality of education.

“In line with the Amma Vodi scheme, Goru Mudda (Mid-day meal scheme with new menu), Naadu-Nedu and English medium education, the government will give Vidya Kanuka kit to every student,” he announced.

“There are about 36, 10,000 students and on June 1, each student will be given a kit worth ₹ 1,350 consisting of a school bag, text and notebooks, cloth for three pairs of uniform, a pair of shoes and two pairs of socks and a belt. The amount towards stitching of uniforms would also be paid,” the Chief Minister said.

The government aimed to increase the literacy rate and the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in colleges through the initiatives, Mr. Jagan, adding said work for refurbishment of 12, 365 schools had been initiated under the first phase of Naadu-Nedu till date.

‘Nine basic components’

“We have identified nine basic components,including toilets, fans, drinking water, furniture, repair works, compound walls and English labs. In all, 45, 000 schools, colleges and hostels will be covered under the programme,” the CM said.

“Universities in various countries and six Indian States are being consulted for the development of English medium curriculum for Classes I to VI to bring in thinner and child-friendly books, handbooks for parents. For teachers to cope with English medium teaching, self-learning apps in addition to training and assessment tests will be introduced. Also, every school will have an English lab, while Telugu remains a compulsory subject,” he said.

Mr. Jagan said the government was spending an additional ₹344 crore for the implementation of the ‘Goru Mudda’ scheme. He said ration and quality of the food would be verified at four levels by different agencies, including parents, SHGs, Village and Ward Secretariats and RDOs.

106,2020/01/21,Three capitals a historic mistake: Tulasi Reddy,"The YSRCP would not have won so many seats in the elections had it put the proposal to have three capitals in its manifesto, N. Tulasi Reddy, APCC working president, said on Tuesday.

Addressing the media here, Mr. Tulasi Reddy said that January 20 was a Black Day in the history of the State. He said the decision to set up Executive and Judicial capitals was a historic mistake.

Had Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy mentioned that the capital would be shifted his party would not have won even 21 seats, he said.

In the name of decentralising development, the government was curbing and slowing down development. Decentralisation of governance was just a pretext to divert public attention from the fact that the State government had failed to get Special Category Status (SCS) and special package for the backward districts, Mr. Tulasi Reddy pointed out.

Another APCC working president Sk. Mastanvali alleged that YSRCP leaders too had purchased thousands of acres in the names of benamis in the north Andhra region.

Mr. Mastanvali said he would release details about the land purchases by the YSRCP leaders soon.

In the name of decentralising development, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had taken the State 10 years back, he observed.

Meanwhile, the newly appointed APCC president, S. Sailajanath, Mr. Tulasi Reddy and Mr. Mastanvali met former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy at his resident in Hyderabad.

They requested Mr. Kiran Kumar Reddy to guide them in strengthening the party.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/three-capitals-a-historic-mistake-tulasi-reddy/article30618918.ece
107,2020/01/21,‘Centre will not intervene in capital issue’,"The Centre will not intervene in the decision of the Jagan Mohan Reddy government to shift the capital out of Amaravati, to Visakhapatnam, said Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders GVL Narasimha Rao and Kanna Lakshminaryana.

Addressing a joint press conference in New Delhi on Tuesday, they said in a federal system, the Centre would not intervene as the proposed shifting of the capital was a State issue. “The BJP is not a control freak, the party believes in democratic norms,” they said.

Joint action plan

The leaders slammed Mr. Jagan for claiming that his decision had the Centre’s support. They said the BJP, along with the Jana Sena Party (JSP) would chalk out a joint action plan for a sustained protest programme in the State against the decision.

The leaders said that the BJP was wedded to decentralisation of development and that the party was in favour of the High Court’s location in Kurnool. Given a chance, they said, the BJP would give top priority to the development of north Andhra and Rayalaseema.

Mr. Narasimha Rao said former Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president Chandrababu Naidu, had ignored the advice of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee and went ahead with his plans to set up the capital in Amaravati, but the Centre did not get in the way of his decision.

He accused both the TDP and the YSRCP of working for selfish gain. Referring to the YSRCP allegation that TDP leaders were involved in insider trading in Amaravati, the Member of the Rajya Sabha asked what prevented the Jagan government from booking the culprits and initiate probe against them. He wondered “if both regional parties are shielding each other.”

He faulted Mr. Naidu’s claim that pooling of 33,000 acres land from Amaravati farmers was a great achievement and said the former had failed to construct even five permanent structures.

Mr. Lakshminarayana predicted that people would “dump” Mr. Jagan in the 2024 elections just the way they did Mr. Naidu in the last elections.

He found fault with allocation of funds to the tune of ₹1,400 crore to Idupulapaya in the CM’s native Kadapa district. “He could have allocated at least ₹700 crore to the north Andhra region,” the BJP leader said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wzajyg/article30621545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22VJPG4-GVL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/centre-will-not-intervene-in-capital-issue/article30618895.ece
108,2020/01/21,Will work for YSRCP’s rout: Pawan Kalyan,"JSP president Pawan Kalyan on Tuesday assured the farmers of Amaravati that he would apprise the Central government of the situation in the State.

Interacting with the party leaders and cadres from Kakinada here, Mr. Pawan said his party would work along with the BJP for Amaravati as the capital.

Mr. Pawan Kalyan said that the JSP-BJP combine would make efforts to show that “this is our capital.”

“No stone will be left unturned to see that the YSRCP is wiped out. All those who have made the farmers and women cry will be doomed,” he said.

Stressed on the need for a new political system in the State, he said it was possible only with the Jana Sena Party.

“Even the BJP opines the same. That is the reason behind the BJP inviting the JSP wholeheartedly for an alliance. Though the YSRCP has a strength of 151 MLAs and 22 MPs, none of the BJP functionaries gives an appointment to them. The TDP, which has a strong cadre, too is not considered,” he said.

Mr. Pawan Kalyan further said that bagging 7% of votes, after the failure of the Praja Rajyam Party (PRP), was a big achievement for the JSP.

The JSP chose to sail with the BJP as it would not resort to opportunistic politics. The BJP-JSP alliance was the need of the hour.

110,2020/01/21,Child rights crusader interacts with Vignan University students,"Compassion for children is one single factor that can unite the world, according to Kailash Satyarthi, global child rights activist who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.

“Children are not responsible for poverty, division, economic inequality, as all these are created by adults, and at the same time, children are becoming vulnerable and are being displaced due to global warming, climate change and globalisation,” said Dr. Satyarthi in an interactive session with students of Vignan University. Dr. Satyarthi was the co-recipient of Nobel Peace Prize along with Malala Yousafzai. He also founded Bachpan Bachao Andolan and led the Global March against child labour in 1998 travelling across 103 countries and was instrumental in bringing the Right to Education Act.

An electric engineer-turned-child rights crusader, Dr. Satyarthi said that he was influenced by the children working in tea stalls and other areas in his neighbourhood, and decided that he should work for the children.

“I was moved by the sight of a cobbler boy near my school and thought why a child should work so early in his life and these thoughts influenced me. I shared my thoughts with my family, and they told me to make friends and enjoy the school. When I decided to chuck the engineering job, my friends thought I am mad, but when I got the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014, the same people began to congratulate me,” said Dr. Satyarthi.

Sharing his views on globalisation and its impact on children in developing countries, Dr. Satyarthi said that globalisation has created more opportunities and created a supply chain which required a huge number of workers in developing countries. So children began to be hired by subcontracting agencies in shoe-making units, apparel units and companies pay them lesser wages.

“On one hand, sexual abuse against children in on rise. Four children are being abused every hour and two children are raped every hour. This must be stopped and even the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals relating to children are to be achieved by the year 2025. Over 260 million children in the world are out of school and we need more social protective measures to provide livelihood to working men and women so that there is no pressure on children to work,” said Dr. Satyarthi.

Vignan gesture

Member of Parliament, Narsaraopet, and vice-chairman of Vignan Group, Lavu Krishnadevarayulu said that the Vignan Group would present ₹5 lakh to the Kailash Satyarthi Children’s Foundation and have a quota for child dropouts in the colleges. Further, the institute would continue working with Dr. Satyarthi and support his crusade against child labour.

Chairman of the group Lavu Rathaiah said that Dr. Satyarthi was a champion of child right and a role model for many students.

Miffed at the attempts to arrest the party’s district president and Chandragiri constituency in-charge Pulivarthi Nani, his supporters and activists resorted to the blockade.

Questioning the wisdom behind the government’s ‘mindless action’ of undoing all the policies started by their party, the leaders said Amaravati was chosen by a duly-elected government and was accepted even by Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, the then Opposition leader in the floor of the house.

Protest at Srikalahasti

At Srikalahasti too, leaders of Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) and Jana Sena Party(JSP) came together to oppose the State government’s decision on changing the capital. At a function organised to hail the selection of J.P. Nadda as the BJP national president, leaders of the two alliance parties flayed the YSR Congress for unilaterally deciding on three capitals.

In the same vein, they also said TDP was worrying more about its leaders’ landholdings rather than the plight of the poor farmers who had voluntarily parted with their lands.

118,2020/01/21,"Executive capital will not benefit North Andhra region, says Youth Congress State president","State Youth Congress president P. Rakesh Reddy on Tuesday alleged that the establishment of three capitals would lead to administrative anarchy instead of ensuring development of all the regions.

Speaking to the media, he said that the Congress would continue to support Amaravati as the capital for the entire State since establishment of Executive capital in Visakhapatnam would not benefit any section of the society. “Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy himself sought 30,000 acres for Amaravati capital when he was in Opposition. Now, he changed his voice and stand.”

District Congress Party president Yedla Adiraju and district Youth Congress Party president Sunkari Satish asked the government to allocate more funds for the development of Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts instead of shedding crocodile tears for the North Andhra region. They said that the then UPA government had taken many steps for the speedy development of the residual State but the TDP and the YSR Congress Party governments had spoiled them with the adoption at wrong policies.

Vizianagaram Congress president Dola Srinivasa Rao said that there was no response from people of Vizianagaram over the proposed Executive capital in Visakhapatnam since it would not benefit them in any way.

Earlier, Mr. Rakesh Reddy, AICC member Vegi Venkatesh, Youth Congress leaders L. Ramana Rao, P. Siva Krishna and others had interacted with the party activists.

120,2020/01/21,Key documents ‘untraceable’ in Vakapalli case,"A reserve inspector of the Armed Reserve Police submitted to a special court here on Tuesday that the department was unable to trace the Duty Roster and the Armoury General Diary in the 2007 Vakapalli gangrape case.

Special Public Prosecutor S. Rajendra Prasad had sought for the registers from the Paderu Police Station and the Armed Reserve Police to gain information about the deployment of the Special Party Police in August 2007.

Judge O.V. Nageswar Rao of the SC/ST Special Court asked the Reserve Inspector why he has failed to produce the registers which should be mandatorily maintained in each and every police station, including the Armed Reserve. The judge added that if the registers were destroyed, the police should at least produce the Destruction Register.

The Special Public Prosecutor submitted to the court that three months have passed and yet the concerned police have not produced the registers or the Destruction Register. He also reminded the court that the Nagi Reddy report was also not produced before the court. He wondered whether these documents and registers were genuinely untraceable or if they were deliberately not being produced.

The Special Public Prosecutor concluded that if the police do not make their stand clear, he would be constrained to ask the court to initiate criminal proceedings under Section 349 CrPC against the witnesses for not obeying the court’s summons to produce the documents.

The judge posted the case to February 4, as a last chance for the production of the registers.

Decade-long case

It may be recollected that on August 20, 2007, 11 Adivasi women of Vakapalli village in Nurmati panchayat of G. Madugula mandal in Visakhapatnam Agency were allegedly gangraped by 21 personnel of the AP Special Police, who were said to be on a combing operation in Naxal-affected areas. Of the 21 accused, 13 were implicated in the case.

A visibly shaken Mr. Galla told media persons in Guntur that he was abused and treated in an inhuan way by the CRPF personnel. Mr. Galla, along with a group of local land owners tried to storm the Assembly, but were prevented by the police. The police who whisked away the MP, registered cases against him under different sections, including section 354, 324, both of them non-bailable sections.

123,2020/01/21,Wild elephant electrocuted near Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh,"In a fresh incident of electrocution, one more wild elephant was killed in the fields near Tekumanda village of Bangarupalem mandal, 30 km from here, in the early hours of Tuesday, bringing the toll of the pachyderms to an agonising figure of seven, six of them due to electrocution, in a span of 10 months, all happening in a radius of about 15 km of the sanctuary zone.

According to information, a big herd from the wildlife sanctuary made its way into the agriculture fields close to Tekumanda village on Monday night. The farmers and local youth were worried seeing the pachyderms trampling the crops.

A team of elephant trackers rushed to the spot, and was on the job of driving them back into the forests, producing heavy noise with drums and weird shrieks. In the melee, one of the elephants crashed against an electric pole in the darkness. The pole got uprooted and the live overhead power line fell on the fleeing jumbo, killing it instantaneously. At dawn, a huge crowd of local people stormed the spot to have a look at the carcass of the giant male jumbo.

Senior forest officials inspected the spot, while a team of veterinary doctors were deployed to perform post-mortem of the electrocuted pachyderm.

It is the first jumbo casualty in the Koundinya wildlife zone in 2020, while the number of elephant casualties remained at six in 2019. A vast stretch of forest fringe areas is left without any fence or trenches, making human habitations and fields vulnerable to raiding elephants, and moreover exposing the pachyderms to a high risk of getting electrocuted.

Several farmers allege that the forest personnel were not swift in responding to their appeals for providing protection to their crops. In spite of the electrocution of seven jumbos, no tangible alternative measures were implemented concerning overhanging power lines and presence of unsafe transformers in the fields, abutting the elephant sanctuary, they said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wild-elephant-on-the-run-electrocuted-near-chittooor-in-andhra-pradesh/article30613976.ece

Trouble broke out as soon as the House assembled at 10 am. The TDP MLAs raised “Save Amaravati” slogans. Mr. Seetharam conducted the business amidst protests and noisy scenes. At one point, TDP MLAs went to the Speaker’s podium and began raising slogans holding placards. Repeated requests by Mr. Tammineni went unheeded and the TDP MLAs trooped the podium obstructing the House business. They also engaged in a cross talk with the YSRC MLAs from the podium.

Later, as soon as Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy entered the House at around 11.15 am, the Speaker said he was protesting. The MLAs were also clueless whether it was a break or not.

128,2020/01/21,BJP will not allow three capitals,"Strongly condemning the splitting of the capital city Amaravati into three parts, BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana said the national party would not let Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy implement his decision.

Mr. Lakshminarayana also dismissed as false propaganda the State government’s claims to have the support of the Central government to the decentralised model of development.

Addressing the media persons in New Delhi on Monday, Mr. Lakshminarayana said he could not see any motive except the intention to do real estate business behind the shifting of the capital city to Visakhapatnam.

He sought to know the reason for not publicising the report of the Special Investigation Team which probed the major land scandal in the port city if the CM was committed to transparency and bringing fraudsters to book.

He said former CM N. Chandrababu Naidu had done exactly what Mr. Jagan was doing now to protect vested interests.

‘People’s issue’

The Chief Minister was expected to learn the lesson taught by the people to TDP in the 2019 elections and refrain from committing the same mistakes which brought it (TDP)’s downfall but he was apparently oblivious to the stark reality.

Mr. Lakshminarayana said the shifting of the capital was not a problem of the farmers in capital villages but of five crore people of the State.

Changing the capital in the name of decentralisation was a retrograde move, he said, warning that the BJP would stall it in view of its repercussions.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/4g30xj/article30612488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21ONGKANNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bjp-will-not-allow-three-capitals-kanna-lakshminarayana/article30612489.ece

130,2020/01/21,Decentralisation a corrective measure: CM,"Calling his government’s decision to develop three capital cities as a corrective measure, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy asserted that a plethora of committees, including the one headed by K.C. Sivaramakrishnan constituted by the Central government, had recommended the decentralised model for the balanced development of the State and it was what the government was following with a vision for the entire State.

Mr. Jagan observed that if the grandiose plans conceived by former CM N. Chandrababu Naidu were to be given a tangible shape, the creation of trunk infrastructure alone in Amaravati over a 30-year period would escalate to about ₹5.97 lakh crore from the current estimate of ₹1.09 lakh crore.

The State neither has the financial wherewithal required to build such a mega city nor was it essential to splurge money on such an ambitious project when its finances were crippled, he said.

‘Regional aspirations’

Making a statement on the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020 in the Assembly on Monday, Mr. Jagan said regional aspirations were to be kept in mind at this historic juncture as the north coastal districts and Rayalaseema had been suffering for decades as everything was concentrated in Hyderabad and there was a danger of the same thing happening in the Vijayawada-Guntur region if the seats of governance and development were limited to Amaravati which was home to virgin, multi-cropped land.

The government had, therefore, resolved to have three capital cities for administrative, legislative and judicial functions, the CM said and went on to substantiate his government’s argument in favour of the decentralised model as opposed to a ‘honey pot’ pattern. He continued speaking till late in the night.

YSRCP lying: Naidu

Earlier, Mr. Naidu pointed out that none of the committees, which the government was banking upon to take forward its proposal forward, had made such suggestions, nor did the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act made such a recommendation. The bifurcation Act too made a mention about a capital, but not three. In fact, the Sivaramakrishnan Committee which was referred to by the government has not suggested three capitals.

Mr. Naidu stressed the need for decentralisation of development but not governance.

The Sivaramakrishnan Committee favoured Visakhapatnam after the Vijayawada-Guntur area. The committee never said the capital should be developed in that region. The YSR Congress leaders were spreading lies, he alleged, adding the TDP government selected the area between Vijayawada and Guntur keeping the needs of future generations in mind.

Investments stalled

There is a flight in investments due to stalling of the works at Amaravati. There was a real estate boom in Hyderabad. “Though the Chief Minister is younger than me in age, I request him with folded hands to rethink on government plans, he said, adding, “I will be very happy if the government released funds to Srikakulam and Vizianagaram on a par with Kadapa district. Think of the farmers who parted with their land.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/decentralisation-a-corrective-measure-cm/article30610855.ece

Mr. Venkaiah Naidu, who arrived in Venkatachalam of Nellore district by train, interacted with Telugu scholars and experts in Telugu language over luncheon on Monday, according to a release.

Speaking on the occasion, he said, “Classical languages represent the knowledge and wisdom of our ancient thinks, scientists, poets, sages, doctors, philosophers and rulers. If we don’t preserve and sustain this link, we lose a very precious key to the treasure house we have all inherited.”

The Vice President, referring to reports, expressed concern over the fact that more than 40 languages or dialects in India are considered to be endangered and are believed to be heading towards extinction as only a few thousand people speak them.

The discussion with scholars centred around the promotion of classical Telugu language and the development of the ‘Centre of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu’ (CESCT) which was set up under the Central Institute of Indian Languages in 2008.

Later, the Vice President witnessed ‘Bhuvana Vijayam’, showcasing the best of Telugu classical poetry, at Swarna Bharat Trust.

132,2020/01/21,People watch capital debate keenly,"At a time when the people in capital villages were agitating against the YSRCP government’s move to decentralise capital amidst police lock-down, people of the city spent most of the time glued to the proceedings of the Assembly on Monday.

The Assembly in the capital region discussed the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of all Region Bill 2020 and The Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Bill 2020. The live discussion over the Bills by the ruling party members and the Opposition party members were widely viewed on the television sets and mobile phones. Protests were led by the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi JAC at the Dharna Chowk in the city and protesters were detained by police. At some junctions, traffic flow was obstructed due to police restrictions and motorists had to take longer routes to reach their destinations.

Though the outcome of the discussion was not unexpected, people wanted to know how both the ruling and Opposition parties would substantiate their stands for and against the decentralisation plan respectively.

Some of them kept tracking the proceedings right from the time the session began in the morning to late night when it concluded. The live telecast of the proceedings on YouTube channels also garnered a huge number of views.

‘Govt. ignored protesters’

“The State government completely ignored the protests by the people of Amaravati during the past one month and there was no proper explanation why it had to go with the decentralisation plan. People are actually waiting to hear how the government could justify its decision,” said P. Rama Rao, who was keenly watching the developments on TV at a store.

133,2020/01/21,Mass migration increases in western parts of Kurnool district,"As harvest season picks up pace, mass migration of agriculture labour has begun in Kurnool district. Villages have started to sport an abandoned look as people migrate to neighbouring districts in search of work.

While the district was blessed with copious amounts of rain previous year, it was mostly concentrated in the eastern parts of the district. Whatever rain was received by the western parts of the district, while being more than normal, was not sufficient.

Speaking with The Hindu, Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV) activist K. Mohan said that the western parts — Yemmiganur, Pattikonda, Kodumur etc. — have started witnessing mass migration. “About half the people have left the town in my village near Yemmiganur town,” he added.

However, even the insufficient rains seem to have reduced the mass migration marginally as some people are still in their villages. “The people living in areas that have access to irrigation water are still in their villages. They will leave once the final harvesting takes place,” said Mr. Mohan. As the predominant crop in western parts of the district is cotton, and with the cotton season coming to an end soon, migration is expected to pick up the pace. “Only the last plucking of cotton is left, and some people are working on onions as there is a high price now. The season for both the crops will end soon,” the RSV activist added. HRF State president U.G. Srinivasulu said that migration would reduce only if the people have access to irrigation water. He stressed on the importance of irrigation projects for the western parts of the district and said, “just Rajoliband Diversion Scheme (RDS) would make sure that 40,000 acres in the western parts of the district would have sufficient water.”

138,2020/01/21,"Balijas vow to intensify struggle for reservation in jobs, politics","The Balija community in Karnataka is planning to intensify its struggle for employment and political reservation. The backward community, whose classification was shifted from 2A to 3A in 1994, had been deprived of reservation in education, employment and political fields.

Though the State government shifted the community to 2A for reservation in 2010, employment and political reservation has eluded them. “We are a 50 lakh strong backward community in Karnataka. But, we have been deprived of job and political reservation,” rued former chairman of Mysuru Paints and Varnishes H.A. Venkatesh.

The leaders of the community, who had gathered at the annual general body meeting of the Yogi Narayana Balija Sangha in Mysuru recently, vowed to intensify their struggle for political and employment reservation.

Former Minister M.R. Seetharam, present at the meeting, said the 1994 State government had wronged the community by shifting its classification from 2A to 3A. He said he would not rest till the benefits of employment and political reservations were extended to the community.

Mr. Venkatesh said the community had been subjugated ever since the then M. Veerappa Moily government shifted its classification from 2A to 3A. Though reservation in education was restored in 2010 by the B.S. Yeddiyurappa government, the community’s struggle for employment and political reservation has not paid off, he regretted.

On account of the ‘unscientific’ classification of the community, it has been denied of selections in the Karnataka State Public Service Commission (KPSC) and berths in the Cabinet, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/balijas-vow-to-intensify-struggle-for-reservation-in-jobs-politics/article30619119.ece
139,2020/01/21,Karnataka HC orders issue of notice to government on beggary Act,"The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday ordered issue of notice to the State government on a PIL plea questioning the constitutional validity of the provisions of the Karnataka Prohibition of Beggary Act, 1976, which criminalises begging.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the order on the petition filed by the Peoples Union of Civil Liberties, Karnataka.

The petitioner questioned the validity of Sections 2(1), 2(2), 3, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, and 40(f) and (g) of the Act while claiming that these provisions, which deal with prohibition, arrest, detention, and punishment, among other things, were contrary to the rights of equality before law, freedom of speech and expression, protection of life, and personal liberty guaranteed under the Constitution.

The exemptions given for certain acts from the definition of beggary is arbitrary, the petitioner claimed. It also pointed out that while receiving alms in a public place — whether or not under any pretence such as singing, dancing, fortune-telling, performing tricks, and selling articles — is an offence, exemption is given to performance of any religious vow or obligation as sanctioned by custom or religion.

“The poor cannot be penalised for the failure of the government to provide them with the bare necessities of life. For those people who are unable to work for a range of reasons, including age, sickness and disability, and [for those] with no other adequate means of earning, the only option available is to beg,” the petitioner claimed. The outfit also contended that any interference in one’s right to livelihood amounts to a violation of fundamental rights.

Lack of distinction

‘The Act, the petitioner contended, does not distinguish lawful and unlawful begging. It also fails to distinguish between the crimes of organised begging, where vulnerable people are threatened and coerced into begging, and the destitute begging for survival.

The petitioner sought directions from the court to conduct an audit of collection of Beggary Cess under the Act and to direct the government to provide pension, open shelter, community kitchens, health services and livelihood support to the destitute in the State. The petitioner also sought a direction to the government to convert receiving centres and relief centres set up under the Act into voluntary and people-friendly centres for the destitute.

It was pointed out in the petition that the Delhi and Jammu and Kashmir High Courts had already declared as unconstitutional similar provisions.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-hc-orders-issue-of-notice-to-government-on-beggary-act/article30619116.ece

141,2020/01/21,Mangaluru police probing link between bomb suspect and hoax caller,"The Mangaluru city police are looking into a possible link between the suspect who placed an improvised explosive at the international airport here and the person who made a hoax call informing the airport terminal manager of an explosive in a private aircraft.

As the process of defusing the explosive, found near the flight ticket counter, was under way on Monday afternoon, a caller informed the terminal manager of an explosive aboard an Indigo flight to Bengaluru. Following a through check of passengers, their baggage and the aircraft, the call was confirmed to be a hoax.

“We are trying to find whether there is a link between the suspect and the person who made the call to the terminal manager,” said Mangaluru Police Commissioner P.S. Harsha.

In a statement released to the media, Mr. Harsha said that the investigation team was looking at earlier cases of hoax calls made to different airports. “We are analysing the information and finding out whether the callers in those cases match the suspect in this case,” he said. One of the suspects is a person arrested in 2018 by the Bengaluru police for a threat call made to the Bengaluru airport.

Videos and pictures

The police are also looking at videos and photographs of persons resembling the suspect. “We are verifying the material sent by the public,” he said.

The police have seized the autorickshaw that reportedly ferried the suspect to the airport and questioned the driver. “We have questioned a number of suspects and carried out searches. We will soon find the person involved,” Mr. Harsha said.

The Bomb Disposal and Detection Squad (BDDS) of the State police has sent the remnants of the explosive substance for forensic examination. The BDDS officials feel the explosive substance was a crude one, the police officer said.

In a tweet, he said, “Mangaluru police are investigating the suspected explosive material recovered from MIA and subsequently disposed of, and has made progress on available leads. This is a very serious investigation and [we] appeal [to] all leaders of society to take a very responsible stand.”

Business as usual

At the airport, it was business as usual on Tuesday. Vehicles entering the airport were checked at the entry point, while Central Industrial Security Force personnel made regular rounds to check unclaimed baggage.

142,2020/01/21,Mangaluru incident shows failure of intelligence agencies: Siddaramaiah,"Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah on Tuesday questioned the efficiency of intelligence agencies following their failure in connection with the incident of an explosive being found near the ticket counter of Mangaluru International Airport on Monday.

The former Chief Minister, who participated in Sri Urugamma Devi and Sri Masanamma Devi temples’ inauguration at Cheeranahalli in Mandya district, spoke to presspersons for a while here and said the incident has sent shock waves through the community and those responsible for it should be stringently punished.

Emphasising on the need for a thorough investigation, the veteran Congress leader said, “Mangaluru is witnessing such incidents one after the other and what are intelligence agencies doing about this?” The State government has completely failed to curb such incidents. It should have been on alert immediately after the recent killing of two persons in police firing during the anti-CAA protests in Mangaluru. But, it has failed, he said.

Reacting to the State Cabinet reshuffle, Mr. Siddaramaiah said: “There is no active government in Karnataka. For the past six months, there are no ministers for 18 portfolios. How can [Chief Minister B.S.] Yediyurappa manage all the departments?”

According to him, the State government was a ‘dead government’ and some ministers were given additional portfolios but they were not discharging their duties.

“The BJP had promised to include the disqualified MLAs within 24 hours after their victory. Mr. Yediyurappa has no power to expand the cabinet as Union Home Minister Amit Shah has not given permission for this.

Regarding the for-and-against discussions on appointing four ‘working presidents’ to the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee, Mr. Siddaramaiah asked if there was no working president when former Minister R.V. Deshpande was the State Congress chief.

“It is being rumoured that I am putting pressure on the requirement of four working presidents. This is a media creation. During Mr. Deshpande’s regime, [former Minister] D. K. Shivakumar was the working president. If [former Deputy Chief Minister] G. Parameshwara has said that there is no need for a working president, it is his opinion.”

The workers have a 12-point charter of demands such as inclusion in the payrolls of the State government, timely release of their salary, and stopping outsourcing of midday meal programme to private organisations or non-governmental agencies.

Sources in the Department of Public Instruction claimed that alternative arrangements were made to provide meals for students.

“In some schools, only a few workers had gone for the protest and the remaining workers cooked the meals, while in other places, the School Development and Monitoring Committee made arrangements,” a source in the department said.

Some of their other demands are ensuring that the workers get accident relief benefit as well as provident fund and ESI benefits. There are nearly 1.16 lakh midday meal workers across the State and they are demanding the intervention of the Chief Minister to address their grievances.

The 15-point circular issued by the department states that criminal action must be initiated against the encroachers and officials who colluded with them.

“The circular has been issued directing the Deputy Commissioners to initiate recovery along with taking action against revenue inspectors, tahsildars, assistant commissioners, and others who had colluded with the enroachers,” said the official.

The Deputy Commissioners have been directed to suspend officials found to be prima facie involved in fraudulent practices of creating false records and file criminal case against them.

147,2020/01/21,Govt. withdraws order against recovery of farm loans,"In a controversial move, the State government has withdrawn instructions given to the Karnataka State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development (KASCARD) Bank to not recover loans from farmers in drought-affected regions of the State.

In a communication to the managing director of the KASCARD Bank recently, the Registrar of Cooperative Societies (RCS) asked the bank to start the process of recovery of loans from farmers in 110 taluks that were declared as drought-hit in 2016–17. It drew the attention to the earlier order that had explicitly asked cooperative societies and officials not to give any notice or move court to recover the loans extended in the 2016–17 monsoon season in the light of drought.

The letter from the RCS comes in the light of a clarification given by the Finance Department in the second week of December 2019. In the letter, the department had clarified that the October 20, 2016 order issued to stop recovery process was based on the instructions from the then Chief Minister [Siddaramaiah]. “The Finance Department has not given any concurrence for the same. The KSCARD Bank’s decision to not recover the loans quoting the 2016 circular is not a valid justification,” the department stated in a letter to the RCS.

The department has advised the RCS that the KSCARD Bank extending loans and recovering it is the sole jurisdiction of the bank and it is up to to the bank to decide the mode of recovery of loans. “The Finance Department shall not have any specific comments or instructions on this issue,” it said. The department’s opinion to the RCS came after a meeting of the Additional Chief Secretary and the Development Commissioner on October 4, 2019.

Mr. Siddaramaiah in a series of tweets on Tuesday condemned the government’s move.

148,2020/01/21,What happened at Mangaluru airport was a farce: Kumaraswamy,"Describing the actions over the disposal of an explosive material found at Mangaluru International Airport (MIA) on Monday as a “farce”, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said on Tuesday that it was not as serious a matter as projected.

Addressing presspersons at Thokkottu on the outskirts of the city, the JD(S) leader said the disposal of the explosive appeared more like a drill conducted on special occasions.

Mr. Kumaraswamy said he felt that the explosive was not capable of large-scale damage. “It seems to be a conspiracy created by some organisations to create a rift between two sections of society. It has been publicised on a large scale to create fear among people,” he said.

The former Chief Minister also said that the State government should reveal the “truth” behind Monday’s incident. He also urged the government to take action against organisations spreading fear and working to divide society.

Mangaluru and peace

Without naming anyone, the former Chief Minister said, “Don’t spoil the image of Mangaluru, which is economically vibrant. Don’t create mistrust among sections of society in the coastal belt.”

He also said that during his 14-month tenure as Chief Minister, the situation was peaceful in Mangaluru and the coastal belt. After the BJP came to power, Mangaluru has been hitting the headlines for the wrong reasons, he said, adding that it was so in 2008 as well, when churches were attacked under the BJP regime.

He also said that the recent decisions of the Union government on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens were leading to nationwide protests. On other hand, there are some pro-CAA conventions as well. All of this is creating an atmosphere of fear in society, Mr. Kumaraswamy said. He urged the public to be wary of organisations and parties such as the BJP which were “trying to divide society”.

Earlier in the day, at Sringeri, he enquired in a lighter vein if the Mangaluru City Police Commissioner had “put a bomb anywhere else”. He also wondered out loud why such incidents were happening only in Mangaluru.

Harsha meets HDK

Mangaluru Police Commissioner P.S. Harsha met Mr. Kumaraswamy during the latter’s brief visit to Mangaluru.

Asked about the meeting, the JD(S) leader said what they discussed could not be divulged. He added that Mr. Harsha had stated that he did not have any role to play in what happened at Mangaluru airport on Monday.

In a statement to the media, Mr. Harsha said, “It was nothing more than a security visit as the former Chief Minister is a protectee.

151,2020/01/21,Congress leaders seek coordination panel in Karnataka,"A few Congress leaders have urged the party high command to constitute a coordination committee to establish checks and balances for the State unit of the party.

Sources in the party said leaders such as M. Veerappa Moily, B.K. Hariparasad and K.H. Muniyappa have urged the Central leaders to set up the coordination panel to prevent some leaders from taking unilateral decisions. The leaders believe that the establishment of such a panel will help bring about consensus on various matters.

Though former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and former Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president G. Parameshwara have opposed the constitution of such a panel, Mr. Moily, Mr. Hariparasad and Mr. Muniyappa are believed to have met K.C. Venugopal, All-India Congress Committee general secretary in charge of Karnataka, and requested him to constitute the panel.

152,2020/01/21,Muniyappa joins leaders batting for split of posts in Karnataka Congress,"Seven-time MP and senior Congress leader K.H. Muniyappa on Tuesday came out in support of the separation of the posts of Leader of the Opposition and Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader.

Already, a group of “original” Congress leaders and MLAs such as G. Parameshwara, H.K. Patil and D.K. Shivakumar have been demanding the separation of the two posts. Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had held both posts, till he resigned from the post of Leader of the Opposition on December 9, following the Congress’ poor showing in the State byelections.

Speaking to presspersons, Mr. Muniyappa, one of the aspirants for the post of KPCC president, said allotting the two posts to two legislators would benefit the party and help establish better coordination among legislators and party leaders.

His statement comes amid reports that the Congress high command was weighing options, including appointing a new CLP leader while continuing with Mr. Siddaramaiah as Leader of the Opposition. However, Mr. Siddaramaiah favours a single leader holding both posts.

The former MP also urged the Central leadership to issue an order appointing a new KPCC president soon to douse the growing discontent in the rank and file of the party.

Meanwhile, Mr. Patil has joined the camp opposing Mr. Siddaramaiah’s proposal on appointing four working presidents to the KPCC.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/muniyappa-joins-leaders-batting-for-split-of-posts-in-karnataka-congress/article30616948.ece

154,2020/01/21,Centre urged to remove GST on LIC premium,"Members of the All India Life Insurance Corporation Agent’s Forum, Mandya unit, staged a protest here on Tuesday, urging the Union government to immediately withdraw the Goods and Services Tax (GST) on premiums.

The implementation of GST on premiums and policies has been badly affecting the policy holders as well as agents. The government has been imposing GST on the service charge for changing nominations and this is against the interest of several crores of policy holders across the country, they told presspersons.

The Union government was also urged to increase the bonus on policies/premiums of the policy holders.

There was no tax/service charge on premiums/policies from 1956 to 2014. Unfortunately, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has taken some steps that have been discouraging the people from taking life insurance policies besides causing financial burden to the policy holders, the agitators said.

They demanded an income tax rebate of ₹1,00,000 on insurance policies to policy holders; and enhancement of group insurance, medical expenses and gratuity for the agents.

156,2020/01/21,Kadakola: Many fall sick as water source contaminated,"A surveillance team from the Department of Health and Family Welfare has been stationed at Kadakola village near Mysuru after at least 100 people fell sick after drinking contaminated water.

The open well at the village, the source of drinking water to about three residential colonies, is ‘contaminated’ and supply from it has been stopped after people complained of vomiting and dysentery.

About 72 people who had fallen sick are said to be recovering and about seven people have been hospitalised. Until further arrangements, water is being supplied to the population through tankers besides RO water for drinking.

District Surveillance Officer Shivaprasad told The Hindu that three residential localities are affected and corrective steps have been taken by the local authorities from where the cases had been reported.

“Contaminated water was supplied to about 180 houses resulting in people complaining of vomiting and dysentery. There is no need for panic and the sick people are recovering. Two people are being treated at K.R. Hospital and five children at Cheluvamba Hospital,” he said.

Kadakola, on the busy Mysuru-Nanjangud Road, is surrounded by industrial areas.

Dr. Shivaprasad said a team with about 25 health workers is stationed in the village. “The team will continue surveillance, visiting each and every household, besides educating the community,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kadakola-many-fall-sick-as-water-source-contaminated/article30616601.ece
157,2020/01/21,Farmers in Mysuru district resent paddy procurement norms,"The paddy procurement exercise in Mysuru district has come under flak from farmers who have opposed the stipulations imposed by the government.

The government has put a ceiling on the quantity of paddy that can be procured at 16 quintals per acre while the farmers claim that the yield per acre was higher, ranging from 25 quintals to 40 quintals per acre. They want the cap lifted. Besides, there is provision to purchase only 40 quintals from a farmer or those with upto 2.5 acres of land; those with bigger land holding will not benefit.

In Mysuru district, paddy is the major crop in K.R.Nagar, T.Narsipur, parts of Nanjangud and Mysuru taluks and the 16 quintal limit per acre and 40 quintals per farmer prescribed for procurement will benefit only a handful, according to the Jilla Krishika Samaja.

Samaja president Shivakumar said that the farmers will incur financial loss due to this norm as they will be forced to sell the remaining portion of the produce to traders in the market who are quoting rates below the procurement price announced by the government.

The government price varies from ₹1,815 per quintal to ₹1,835 per quintal depending on the grading of the produce. The open market rates being quoted by traders range from ₹1,400 per quintal to ₹1,500 per quintal.

“Though the government rate is higher, the ceiling has put the farmers in a quandary. The remaining quantity has to be sold to traders directly and the gains made by selling it to the government is neutralised by the loss incurred by selling it to the traders’’, said Atahalli Devaraja, farmer activist and office-bearer of the State Sugarcane Cultivators Association.

He said though the government procurement rates are higher, the entire exercise is a cumbersome process and a farmer from an area has to sell it to the rice mill that is earmarked for him. “There is cost of transportation involved besides investment on procurement of bags to pack’’, said Mr. Devaraj.

In contrast the merchants procure the paddy directly from the field, bring in the weighing machines and arrange to transport the purchase from field to the mill; and most farmers find it convenient.

Badagalpura Nagendra of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sagna said the entire procurement process was an exercise in futility. “A majority of the farmers have already sold the paddy to merchants and hence the procurement process will not benefit them’’, he said.

The KRRS suggested that the government should link paddy procurement to the PDS and distribute it to the public so as to benefit the local cultivators. At present, paddy for the PDS is procured from other wheat and rice growing States and this can be avoided, said Mr. Nagendra.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmers-in-mysuru-district-resent-paddy-procurement-norms/article30616526.ece

159,2020/01/21,Rly. flyover work creates chaos,"The construction of a railway flyover on Hassan-Holenarsipur road in the city has led to traffic diversions, leaving the public in a quandary. The regular commuters on the road to the new KSRTC bus-stand from N.R.Circle are badly hit. The residents of Sharief Colony, located at a stone’s throw away from the bus-stand, now have to commute a long distance to reach the bus-stand.

For years, people of Hassan demanded a flyover on the road connecting N.R. Circle and the new KSRTC bus-stand at Channapatna. The railway gate on the stretch is closed whenever a train passes, causing traffic jams multiple times in a day. Now, the work has begun.

Based on a letter from the Executive Engineer of the Public Works Department, Deputy Commissioner R. Girish, on January 13, issued an order closing the stretch for vehicles for a year to allow the construction work.

People reaching the bus-stand from N.R.Circle have to take the new road next to the taluk office and go via the railway underpass near NDRK College. Those reaching N.R.Circle from the bus-stand have to cross the railway gate and take the road next to Nursing College to reach B.M.Road. However, heavy vehicles including KSRTC buses have been barred from entering these roads. The buses plying to other cities have to commute via by-pass. The city buses have to take Goruru Road route to connect the bus stand to the rest of the city. “If you get into a city bus to reach the bus stand, it will take you around the city before you get down”, said Ganesh, a resident of the city.

The residents of Sharief Colony are finding the traffic diversions problematic. “If I decide to reach the bus stand from Sharief Colony on a two-wheeler, I have to commute not less than 2 km, while the bus stand is only about 200 metres from my locality”, said Ateek Rahaman.

The PWD has put up signboards instructing the public about the traffic diversions. The traffic policemen have been deployed to monitor the traffic.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rly-flyover-work-creates-chaos/article30615694.ece

161,2020/01/21,Woman held on charge of plotting husband’s murder,"The late-night murder of a businessman that jolted the town took a twist here on Tuesday after investigation revealed that his wife was the main accused in the alleged crime.

Hours after Bundaram (30) was found murdered at his residence at Vidya Nagara, the police cracked the case by arresting his wife Chandrika. “We are questioning her and investigating the case,” K. Parashuram, Mandya Superintendent of Police, told The Hindu here.

Interrogation of the accused revealed that she had hired killers to eliminate Bundaram as she had developed an acquaintance with another person named Suresh, said another senior police officer.

Suresh’s close relationship with the woman had come to the notice of the businessman recently and he had severely opposed it. This prompted the woman and her friend to eliminate Bundaram, added the officer.

Late on Monday, a group of accused hired by Chandrika visited Bundaram's house and assaulted him with weapons. Initially, the woman told her neighbours/police that the assailants had fastened her and her son in a room before attacking the victim. But detailed interrogation of the woman, following her contradictory statements, helped the police to crack the case. While Chandrika watched the crime, her two daughters were sleeping in a room, added the officer.

Meanwhile, the accused had forgotten a bag containing a pistol, a dagger and other materials in a bus in Hassan district. The Hassan police, following an explosive found at the Mangaluru International Airport on Monday, was conducting special searches at vital installations in their district. Alert public informed the police about the bag found in the bus.

163,2020/01/21,Another committee to be formed to examine ‘atrocities’ committed by Tipu,"Lessons pertaining to Tipu Sultan in the social science State syllabus school textbooks will be retained in the 2020-21 academic year, but another committee will be set up to look into the “atrocities” committed by the Mysuru ruler.

Speaking at a press conference here on Monday, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said the State government had decided to continue the lessons in the coming academic year. However, he announced that yet another committee will be formed to examine in depth the “atrocities” committed by Tipu.

“Although Madikeri MLA Appachu Ranjan had demanded that the lessons be removed because of the atrocities committed in Kodagu, we want the committee to examine the injustice that was meted out to the people in Melukote and Chitradurga as well,” he said. He also said there was a need for students to study both the “positive as well as negative” characteristics of Tipu.

Elaborating on the government’s decision to retain the lessons on Tipu in the textbooks, he said, “We did not want any delay in the process of allotting work orders for printing the textbooks.”

The issue was first raised by Appachu Ranjan who had written to the department seeking removal of the lessons, terming Tipu a “fanatic”. Subject experts, who were part of the committee, had argued that only “facts” pertaining to him were presented in the class 6, 7 and 10 textbooks and that he was “not glorified”.

The committee formed to deliberate on whether lessons pertaining to the Mysuru ruler should be dropped, retained or modified, had decided that not a single word should be changed in the existing textbooks.

The Hindu had reported last week about how the government wants to give a silent burial to the issue.

While the BJP government, which had scrapped Tipu Jayanthi, also wanted to ensure that students do not study about the ruler, the committee had given a report favouring that lessons pertaining to him should be continued.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dnynyv/article30612449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGTIPUSULTAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/another-committee-to-be-formed-to-examine-atrocities-committed-by-tipu/article30612450.ece

The fest is divided into two parts: the Innovation Exhibition, the general category where anyone can put their models on display, and the Budding Innovators, which is meant for children to showcase their talents.

“We have received 196 entries this year as compared to 148 entries last year.

172,2020/01/21,"Hundreds stage dharna against CAA, NRC in Kalaburagi","Condemning the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), hundreds of activists, under the banner of Karnataka Rajya Dalita Sangharsha Samithi (KRDSS), staged a dharna near the district administrative complex here on Monday. They alleged that the CAA and NRC had been designed to isolate deprived communities and make them develop a sense of Statelessness and landlessness in their own homeland.

“The intention of NRC is to isolate Muslims, Dalits, Adivasis, nomadic tribes and other downtrodden communities that have already been marginalised and suppressed and make them feel a sense of Statelessness. India is their homeland. Most of them have no documents to prove their nationality. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are going to make them illegal immigrants in one stroke by implementing the NRC,” Suresh Hadimani, district convenor of the organisation, said.

Terming the CAA, which excludes Muslims from its ambit, as communal, Mr. Hadimani said it would work diagonally opposite to the secularism enshrined in the Constitution. “India is reeling under a severe economic crisis. The slowdown has hit all the sectors including the job market. Hit by the slowdown, more and more factories and business establishments are closing down each day and thousands of people are joining the army of unemployed. Mr. Modi’s promise of 2 crore jobs a year turned out to be a hoax. In order to conceal their failures, the Modi-Shah duo has come up with CAA-NRC exercise to divert the attention of the masses,” he said.

Referring to the ongoing massive rallies and agitations against the CAA and NRC across the country, Krishnapa Karinika, another leader, said the Centre was insensitive to people’s woes.

“People have massively taken to streets against NRC and CAA. Each and every city and town in the country has witnessed more than one massive mobilisation. The agitations are going on till date. Yet, the Union government is not heeding to the people’s voices,” he said.

They submitted a memorandum, addressed to the President, to the DC’s office demanding the repeal of CAA and dropping the proposed NRC.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tpbqtu/article30610638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hundreds-stage-dharna-against-caa-nrc-in-kalaburagi/article30610639.ece
173,2020/01/21,PUCL criticises Mysuru Bar Association’s resolution,"The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) in Mysuru has criticised the resolution adopted by the Mysuru Advocates’ Association against representing the accused in the sedition case booked by the Mysuru police.

The police had booked a case of sedition after Nalini Balakumar held a placard that read ‘Free Kashmir’ at a protest organised by various groups including University of Mysore Research Scholars’ Association and Dalit Students’ Federation against CAA and NRC at Manasagangothri. Instead of facilitating justice, the lawyers are behaving like judges, regretted Lakshminarayana of PUCL in Mysuru, calling for withdrawal of its resolution.

Several members of PUCL had gathered in Mysuru Court Complex on Monday when lawyers from different parts of the State turned up to sign the Vakalathnama to represent Ms. Balakumar.

The lawyers who turned up to express solidarity regretted that the association passed such a resolution even after she clarified that her intention to hold up the placard was only to bring to the notice the Internet shutdown in Kashmir for the past five months and not to case any kind of hatred.

Journalist activist Gururaj, who was also present in the court complex on Monday, said the association’s resolution was tantamount to suppression of the advocates’ right and freedom to represent seekers of justice.

Meanwhile, the signatories to the Vakalathnama included lawyers from Mysuru despite the Mysuru Advocates’ Association upholding its resolution against representing the accused in the case. Manjula Manasa, an advocate and former chairperson of Karnataka State Women’s Commission, said she was one of the signatories.

Advocate Raghunath, representing Maridevaiah, president, University of Mysore Research Scholars’ Association, and Dalit Students’ Federation, said he had signed the Vakalathnama in favour of his client before the association could adopt the resolution. He added that there was ambiguity in the resolution. There is lack of clarity on whether the resolution was only against the person holding the placard or against all the accused in the sedition case, he said. More than 200 lawyers in Mysuru had signed the appeal submitted seeking a review of its resolution against appearing for the accused in the case.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/naf1om/article30609755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGMYSLAWYERST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pucl-criticises-mysuru-bar-associations-resolution/article30610625.ece
174,2020/01/21,Man assaulted by mob dies,"A man, who was allegedly beaten up by a mob on charge of stealing sheep at Belavatha on the outskirts of Mysuru on Sunday, has died. He was identified as Jaheer, 33.

The police said some people chased Jaheer who was driving an autorickshaw on suspicion of stealing the sheep and the vehicle overturned near Belavatha. The crowd allegedly beat up Jaheer, who died while being taken to hospital. The body was later shifted to K.R. Hospital here for post-mortem.

Karthik, 24, who was present with the deceased in the autorickshaw, fled from the spot. The police handed over the sheep found in the vehicle during the incident to the person owning them. So far, no arrests have been made.

Police Commissioner K.T. Balakrishna told The Hindu that a murder case has been booked against unknown persons and investigations are under way. “We are ascertaining the cause of death although the man was assaulted by the crowd on the charge of stealing sheep.

175,2020/01/21,"Measures to prevent evasion of tax, statutory fee explored","The representatives of various civil society organisations who participated in the meeting organised by Shivamogga City Corporation here on Monday to elicit suggestions from the public on its budget for 2020-21 have suggested for measures to prevent evasion of tax and statutory fee by owners of commercial buildings.

K.V. Vasanth Kumar of Shivamogga Nagarika Hitarakshana Vedikegala Okkuta said the actual built-up area of some private health establishments in the city was much more than what they have taken permission for from the corporation. He demanded that the corporation levy fines on owners of such buildings for illegal construction and collect property tax for the additional built-up area from the present financial year. This would enhance the revenue of the corporation, he said.

He demanded that the corporation form a special team comprising of elected representatives and officials to identify such buildings and conduct a survey on the actual built-up area. Expressing displeasure that to evade the tax, some owners have constructed multi-storied structures after taking permission for construction of makeshift tin-roofed sheds, he pressed the corporation to announce measures to avoid tax evasion in the budget.

S.B. Ashok Kumar, a civil rights activist, said cracks had developed on the surface of concrete roads at Vidya Nagar and other localities in 2015-16. He demanded stern action against contractors who executed the sub-standard works. Referring to road development works being executed under the Smart City Project and with funds released under Chief Minister’s Small and Medium Towns Development Project, he said that, due precaution should be taken to maintain quality in these works.

The participants also demanded allocation of funds in the budget to provide safety equipment for civic workers and for immediate maintenance of roads after the monsoon rains. Latha Ganesh, Mayor; S.N. Channabasappa, Deputy Mayor and Chidananda Vatare, Commissioner, were present in the meeting.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/294dm3/article30610594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGSMGBUDGETMEETING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/measures-to-prevent-evasion-of-tax-statutory-fee-explored/article30610596.ece
176,2020/01/21,‘CM has not said anything about retiring from politics’,"Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs J.C. Madhuswamy, on Monday, said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had not spoken about retiring from politics after his tenure. “Mr. Yediyurappa recently said we will complete the present term and form the government for the next five years. He has not spoken to us on retiring from politics,” he said.

He was reacting to RSS leader Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat’s statement that the CM would not contest elections after completing his tenure.

On the Cabinet expansion, the Minister said the CM was in Davos and would take a decision on the same after he return.

He instructed officers to ensure the government’s welfare programmes and development works were executed on time.

At a review meeting, Mr. Madhuswamy, also Minister in-charge of the district, said the benefit of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Samman Yojana should reach all eligible farmers. The Agriculture Department should also inform and educate farmers on quality seeds, fertilizers and crop patterns they need to follow. He said all departments should show improvement both in financial expenditure and physical progress. The funds meant for the Special Component Plan and Tribal Sub Plan should be utilised as per the norms, he said.

He asked revenue officers to review if the social security pension schemes were reaching the targeted group regularly. He told the officers of the Education Department to work towards maintaining the top position in the SSLC results this year too.

177,2020/01/21,Was it a low-intensity improvised explosive device?,"The explosive material found at Mangaluru airport on Monday morning could be a low-intensity improvised explosive device (IED), said police officials, citing observations of the bomb detection and disposal squad that defused it successfully.

“The sand bags placed around the area where the controlled explosion was triggered did not get damaged. Going by this, it can be concluded that it was a low-intensity IED,” a police officer said. The remnants collected from the blast site were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for a detailed chemical analysis to ascertain the type of explosive substances used.

The IED was recovered from a laptop bag. It contained a battery, wires, a timer, a switch, a detonator, and explosive material, but they were not connected properly, which, according to investigators, could be either a deliberate or foiled attempt.

“There are chances that it was deliberate, as a sort of threat message,” said the officer.

To be authenticated

Though Mangaluru police have released grabs of CCTV camera footage showing a suspect and the autorickshaw in which he was seen leaving, the investigating team is yet to ascertain the authenticity of the footage.

The CCTV camera footage does not show the suspect carrying the bag containing the explosive device and placing it outside the terminal building, said an officer.

The grabs of CCTV camera footage showing a suspect and the autorickshaw in which he was seen leaving were released by the Mangaluru police on Monday.

The police, however, are trying to identify a man who walked away from the airport corridors suspiciously. The police are also tracking down the autorickshaw driver who reportedly dropped the suspect at the airport.

Meanwhile, officials of the National Investigation Agency arrived in Mangaluru to supervise the probe.

The State police said that though they had received a general alert in the wake of the Republic Day, there was nothing specific either to Mangaluru or to the airport. The general alert mentioned stepping up of security in the backdrop of the ongoing anti-CAA protests, a senior police officer said.

Many theories doing the rounds

Multiple theories are doing the rounds on the possible motive behind planting an explosive device at Mangaluru airport on Monday.

One of them is that it could be a retaliation to the police firing incident during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in which two persons were killed, said a senior police officer supervising the investigation. Another theory is that it could be a retaliation to the recent arrest of two terror suspects in Udupi, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lnbemn/article30610532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGBOMB2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/was-it-a-low-intensity-improvised-explosive-device/article30610533.ece
178,2020/01/21,‘Extend loans without looking at CIBIL score’,"Hassan Lok Sabha member Prajwal Revanna has suggested that banks extend loans without taking the scores of Credit Information Bureau India Ltd. (CIBIL), which indicates the credit worthiness of the applicant.

Chairing the first District Development Corporation and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) after being elected MP on Monday, Mr. Revanna said if banks consider the CIBIL score to extend loans, it would be difficult to provide benefits of government’s schemes to farmers. “The government provides subsidy under various schemes. The banks should not go by the score, otherwise, it would be difficult for government’s agencies to meet the target,” he said.

He took exception to the absence of senior officers of NHAI at the meeting. He directed Deputy Commissioner R. Girish to issue notices as these officers were given early notice about the meeting.

He also took the Railway Officers to task for not informing him about the senior officers’ visit to Arsikere Railway station.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fimzhn/article30610517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGHASSANPRAJWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/extend-loans-without-looking-at-cibil-score/article30610518.ece
179,2020/01/21,It took eight hours to defuse the explosive,"It took eight hours to defuse the explosive device found in a bag at the Mangaluru International Airport on Monday morning.

After the bag that found near a flight ticket counter outside the terminal was moved from the spot, Police Commissioner P.S. Harsha held an elaborate meeting with CISF and the Airports Authority of India officials. A decision to take the threat containment vehicle, in which the bag had been placed, to Kenjar was taken later.

Timeline 9.20 a.m.: An abandoned bag is found near a flight ticket counter

9.45 a.m.: Mangaluru police indicate that explosive material could be in it

10 a.m.: The bag is kept in a threat containment vehicle and shifted to a corner of parking area

2 p.m.: The vehicle moves to an open area at Kenjar for defusing

5.35 p.m.: The explosive is defused

The vehicle was placed on the trailer of a tractor using a remote-controlled device. Later, the tractor was driven to Kenjar slowly.

Traffic on both sides of the airport road was stopped to enable free movement of the tractor. After driving for an hour, the driver stopped the vehicle expressing difficulty in moving it down the steep slope leading to the open area. The containment vehicle was then offloaded from trailer.

The police enlisted the services of a crane to help the containment vehicle to slowly move down the slope. Using the remote control, the vehicle was moved about 800 metres further in the open area. A person from the bomb detection and disposal squad wearing the protection suit slowly removed the bag from the vehicle and kept it in the middle of sand bags a few metres away.

After connecting wires to the bag, the squad members stood away from the spot and pressed the trigger. When it did not work, they replaced the wires and successfully defuse the explosive at about 5.35 p.m.

The squad members then collected remnants of the explosive and sent them to the Forensic Science Laboratory in Bengaluru.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pqrqpr/article30610453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGBOMB3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/it-took-eight-hours-to-defuse-the-explosive/article30610455.ece
180,2020/01/21,Irregularities alleged in selection list of gazetted probationers,"The selection list for the posts of 428 gazetted probationer officer for the 2015 batch of the Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC), notified recently, is all set to be challenged in the High Court. It has already been challenged in the Karnataka Administrative Tribunal (KAT).

Aspirants who did not make the cut allege lack of transparency and widespread tampering of marks. A welfare forum of aggrieved KAS aspirants has now demanded a probe into the alleged irregularities by either a judicial commission or the Criminal Investigation Department.

These aspirants, more than a 100, recently met Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar and petitioned them to stay the notification of the selection list and also demanded a re-evaluation.

“We have information from the KPSC that the marks were tampered with after evaluation. We demand that CCTV camera footage of the evaluation room be looked into,” said Vinay, an aspirant. An RTI application has been filed seeking CCTV camera recordings from January 1, 2019 to December 23, 2019.

“Candidates who have consistently secured high marks in their previous attempts — 2011, 2014 — have scored at least 100 to 125 marks below their expectations,” the petition states, claiming tampering. RTI applications have now been filed to seek the last date/time of the first, second and third evaluation of all the digitally evaluated answer scripts and also audit logs of the software.

The KPSC introduced digital evaluation in 2014, but it has till now not published the process of digital evaluation, which is mandatory as it is a e-governance module. “I had raised the issue of lack of checks and balances in the digital evaluation process in 2014 itself, but till date nothing has been disclosed. This itself is a big loophole,” said Vivek, a software engineer and an aspirant.

The KPSC gave only a week’s time when it published the provisional list on December 23, and not the usual 30 days, for filing objections. “The KPSC has not given a break-up of marks in each paper and interview of the selected candidates. This is against transparency. For those of us who did not make it, they only announced a break-up of the written exam and interview scores, and not of the individual papers,” said Farzana T., a teacher and an aspirant. The provisional list got the highest number of objections — 263 — but all were reportedly rejected and the final list was notified on January 10, 2020 without making any changes or giving explanation to those who filed objections, she said.

Multiple attempts made to elicit a response from the KPSC were not successful.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/irregularities-alleged-in-selection-list-of-gazetted-probationers/article30610434.ece
181,2020/01/21,Krishi Mela at UAS-D concludes,"The curtains came down on the three-day Krishi Mela organised by the University of Agricutural Sciences-Dharwad (UAS-D) here on Monday.

An estimated 5.50 lakh people visited the mela this time. Organisers said that the number was less compared to earlier and added that one reason was that this edition was delayed by nearly three months owing to floods in the region.

The consultancy cell saw a steady stream of visitors who came for solutions for various agricultural problems. Several progressive farmers interacted with the visitors and shared their experiences. The Best Youth Farmer and the Best Youth Woman Farmer awards were given on this occasion.

In his address, P.M. Salimath, former Vice-Chancellor, UAS-Raichur, said that recognising the achievements of young farmers is the best practice. J.V. Gouda, former VC, UAS- Dharwad, advised farmers to take cues from progressive and innovative farmers. Farmers should also inculcate innovative methods developed by others and also try to develop their own innovations, he said.

K.N. Kattimani, VC, UAS, Raichur, said that farmers can achieve progress only through integrated farming system and also suggested adopting it for food security.

UAS-D VC M.B. Chetti, presiding over the ceremony, said the event was a good place for farmers to acquire knowledge and stressed that they should learn the art of climate-smart agriculture. “Krishi Mela is a platform for the transfer of new technology and it needs huge publicity.

187,2020/01/21,‘Swachh’ volunteers cheer for citizen feedback,"“Vote for Mysuru” is the new watchword in the city, given the ongoing Swachh Survekshan-2020. The aim is to encourage citizens to participate in the survey by giving their feedback and making Mysuru the country’s ‘cleanest city’.

Wearing identical T-shirts, ‘Swachh’ volunteers are going around the city meeting citizens — in both offices and public places — to encourage them to vote for Mysuru in the survey by going to the webpage https://swachhsurvekshan2020.org/CitizenFeedback. For the next 10 days, college students, numbering about 150, have been tasked with getting as many citizens as possible to participate in the effort to put Mysuru in a better position this time. The volunteers have identified places to meet citizens and encourage them to vote. Each team consists of 10 volunteers.

Mysuru City Corporation Commissioner Gurudatta Hegde has spoken to these volunteers and explained their roles and responsibilities. For the next 10 days, each volunteer has been tasked with getting about 200 feedbacks every day.

Under this initiative, taken up by the MCC and Let’s Do It Mysore, an NGO, the volunteer’s job is to spread awareness about Swachh Survekshan, the importance of citizen feedback, and other issues.

Value of feedback

The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, which is conducting the survey, has stated that the input of citizens on the city’s progress on the ‘Swachh’ front was key in the survey. “The city did not do well in feedback in the last survey. There is a chance now to fix that and give maximum points to the city by going to the website to give feedback,” said B.S. Prashanth, founder of the NGO.

188,2020/01/21,Not many takers for luxury bus service to Mysuru airport,"Despite the “not-very-impressive” response to its luxury bus service to the Mysuru airport, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is keen to add services to the airport as and when more flights were introduced under the UDAN scheme.

As of now, the KSRTC operates five services to the airport from the city bus stand, with 10 trips in total. The service is scheduled as per the arrival and departure of flights. The luxury AC bus service, modelled on the lines of ‘Vayu Vajra’ in Bengaluru, was launched a while back for passenger convenience.

Sources in the corporation said that unlike in Bengaluru, where the BMTC operates round-the-clock buses to Kempegowda International Airport, the service has not found many takers in Mysuru. Passengers seem to prefer private modes of transport to get to the airport though the KSRTC had done publicity on the airport service both at Mysuru airport as well as the city bus stand.

The KSRTC also had plans to operate services to the airport from some prime localities, including Hebbal (as the Infosys campus and some IT companies are located in the Hebbal Industrial Area), but the launch seems to have been put off for want of patronage for the existing services. Also, KSRTC had plans to link the airport services via the city’s leading star hotels to benefit passengers, particularly tourists.

The transport corporation launched bus services to the airport on the request of the airport authorities following the launch of more flights linking the city. The KSRTC urban division has 36 Volvo AC buses that are currently operated on various routes, including Chamundi Hills, KRS, and Hebbal. The airport service was the fourth new route the KSRTC introduced under its luxury segment.

Mysuru is now linked by air to Goa, Kochi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Belagavi, and Chennai. Flights to Kochi have been temporarily suspended. There are plans to provide air connectivity to Mysuru from Coimbatore, Mangaluru, Tirupati, and Shirdi as well.

Divisional Controller Nagaraj said the patronage for the service is better from the airport to the bus stand. “We have put up details at the airport lounge. Once travellers become aware of our services, we hope to get good response to our service. Our crew members update information, if any, and accordingly operate the schedules,” he said.

From the city bus stand to the airport, buses run at 6.50 a.m., 10.35 a.m., 1.55 p.m., 5.40 p.m., and 7 p.m. From the airport to the bus stand, buses start at 8.20 a.m., 11.55 a.m., 3.05 p.m., 7 p.m., and 8.30 p.m.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/257a0/article30610147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGMYSAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/not-many-takers-for-luxury-bus-service-to-mysuru-airport/article30610148.ece
189,2020/01/21,Selective repatriation of engineers in Karnataka draws flak,"A move to repatriate engineers on deputation to their parent department seems to have become a bone of contention. The Karnataka Engineers’ Association has taken exception to what it sees as discriminatory implementation, with only a section of engineers being repatriated. It has shot off a letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa seeking repatriation of all engineers.

It all started with a letter from V. Manjula, Additional Chief Secretary, Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, in August 2019 asking departments to provide details of staff serving outside the parent department for over five years. Following this, a list of nine such engineers on deputation to the Public Works and Water Resources departments were sent for approval from the Chief Minister’s Office. However, approval was accorded to repatriate five engineers to their parent departments, and the orders were issued in the second week of January.

This did not sit well with the Karnataka Engineers’ Association, which shot off a letter to the Chief Minister on Monday. The letter cites the instance of an executive engineer belonging to Karnataka Power Corporation spending more than two decades in the Water Resources Department. It also points out that as an executive engineer, he was holding the additional charge of a chief engineer.

Various provisions of the Karnataka Civil Services (General Recruitment) Rules of 1977 allow the deputation of officers for a minimum of three years and a maximum of five years. In her letter to the department heads, Ms. Manjula had stated that several officers/employees on deputation had “unnecessarily” spent time in “same places for several years”. She had also stated that owing to such long deputations, their parent departments had been unable to utilise their services.

Sources said that in the current matter, engineers on deputation to the PWD and Water Resources Department were from Karnataka State Finance Corporation, Urban Development Department, Karnataka Power Transmission Ltd., Karnataka Power Corporation, and Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation. “An engineer appointed to a finance corporation is being used for recovery purposes. The skill sets of such persons do not match in Public Works and Water Resources departments even though they are civil engineers,” a source said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/selective-repatriation-of-engineers-in-karnataka-draws-flak/article30610121.ece
190,2020/01/21,Congress leaders irked by bid to make Shivakumar KPCC chief before consultations,"The Congress high command’s bid to make former Minister D.K. Shivakumar president of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) even before holding consultations with State leaders, particularly former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, is believed to have irked many. This has led to further delay in the appointment of a new chief for the State unit.

The Central leaders apparently zeroing in on Mr. Shivakumar even before sending observers to Bengaluru for talks with leaders has reportedly not gone down well with Mr. Siddaramaiah, and this has resulted in sharp differences between the State and Central leaders. Sources in the party said the announcement of a new KPCC chief was unlikely this month.

Mr. Shivakumar, instead of building consensus in the State Congress on his candidature, has made attempts to get the appointment order from the high command, local leaders said. The Central leaders, who were in a dilemma after Mr. Siddaramaiah’s camp supported former Minister M.B. Patil for the post, withheld their decision, sources said.

Leaders divided

Sharp differences have surfaced among party leaders, not only on the choice of KPCC chief, but also on the proposal to appoint four working presidents to the KPCC and the separation of Leader of the Opposition and Congress Legislature Party leader posts.

While seniors such as G. Parameshwara and Mr. Shivakumar are opposed to having four working presidents, Mr. Siddaramaiah and his loyalists, including Satish Jarkiholi, favour it, citing regional and caste considerations.

Speaking to presspersons here, Dr. Parameshwara, a former KPCC chief himself, said having four working presidents would lead to “groupism and factionalism”. He even opposed the appointment of one vice-president. However, the former Deputy Chief Minister favoured the separation of the Leader of the Opposition and CLP leader posts.

On Mr. Siddaramaiah’s displeasure on the separation of the two posts, he said it was “his personal opinion”. The party has two persons for these two posts and this could be followed here, Dr. Parameshwara said.

Mr. Shivakumar, however, was tight-lipped on both matters. He merely said he was only loyal to the party sand not to any individual.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-leaders-irked-by-bid-to-make-shivakumar-kpcc-chief-before-consultations/article30610065.ece
191,2020/01/21,"Interweaving myth and fact, this play highlights human cost of Kashmir conflict","The play Eidgarh Ki Jinnath by Abhishek Majumdar tells about the human cost of the conflict in Kashmir and the generation of radicalised children in the Valley.

The theatrically hypnotic work, staged on the second day of the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) in Thrissur on Tuesday, showcases their miserable childhood owing to the troubled state of affairs in the Valley and frequent Army interventions.

Orphaned siblings

The play, the Hindi-Urdu version of Mr. Majumdar’s original work Djinns of Eidgarh, develops with two orphaned siblings, Asharafi and Bilal, who are stranded by the troubles in Kashmir. Part of a teenage football team, 18-year-old Bilal has set great heights for his football career. He hopes to play in international level and aspires to live abroad with his sister.

But his hopes were curtailed by the violence around them.

The play talks about the psychological wounds inflicted by war on the poor children.

Mythical world

Haunted by hope, Asharafi is caught in the past. She is retreating into a mythical world of gods and demons.

Bilal is torn between escaping the myths of war and the cycles of resistance. In Muslim legend, the djinn is a spirit capable of assuming human or animal form and can exercise supernatural powers over people. Interweaving true stories and testimonies with Islamic story telling, the powerful and haunting play shifts between facts and fantasy, the real and the imagined.

With a hard-hitting subject with spectacular performances, it takes you on a roller-coaster ride.

The beautiful lighting of the play and the music take viewers to the picturesque Valley of Kashmir.

The play was staged by the Bhasha Centre for Performing Arts, Bengaluru.

“War, like tragedy, has no one shade. Not only does it mean different things to different people but it also means different things to the same person at different moments. Subjectivity, like theatre, is something one experiences in parallel, both as an individual and as a collective.

This double bind, this creation of meaning and experience of the one and the many, is as central to this production as it is to the story of Kashmir and of course to the act of performing tragedy in a world looking for a god of escape,” says Mr. Majumdar.

Told by the Wind by the Llanarth Group, United Kingdom, directed by Phillip Zarilli, and Silver Epidemic, Companhia Mungunzá de Teatro, Brazil, directed by Georgette Fadel were the other two plays staged on Tuesday.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jxhxvf/article30619178.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvtr-itfok,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/interweaving-myth-and-fact-this-play-highlights-human-cost-of-kashmir-conflict/article30619158.ece

Sun Xiang, project manager, Shenzhen Water Planning and Design Institute Co. Ltd, China, is scheduled to present the sponge city concept at a two-day conference on ‘policies and strategies for flood management in Kerala’ being organised by the department here this week. He will also visit Kochi, senior Irrigation Department officials said.

Other cities too

The conference, which will discuss water resource-related issues and formulate policies, will be held on Thursday and Friday, Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty said on Monday.

''We are looking at Kochi initially. Cities such as Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram can be included in later stages,'' Joshy K. A., Chief Engineer, Irrigation Design and Research Board (IDRB), said.

The concept is one of several ideas being explored to tackle floods in the State, The Dutch 'room for river' concept and flood-control dams are also under consideration. Kuttanad is the ideal candidate for the 'room for river' programme.

Paul van Meel, an expert on Integrated Water Resources Management from the Netherlands, also is scheduled to address the conference. Flood-control dams are being planned in six river basins, namely Periyar, Achencoil, Meenachil, Chaliyar, Pampa and Chalakudy.

Integrated water resources management is key to the State's future water security and the conference will discuss the issue in detail, Mr. Krishnankutty said.

''The combined water resources of the 44 rivers in Kerala is 2,756 tmc. Resources in the catchment areas is 2,484 tmc and the volume of usable water is 1,510 tmc. By 2030 our water demand would go up by 300 tmc.

Pradeepkumar Varma on Tuesday morning, marking the culmination of the 63-day Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrim season.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told reporters that 675 projects worth ₹35,028.84 crore had been approved so far.

KIIFB has also sanctioned ₹14,275 crore for acquiring land for industrial parks and ₹5,374 crore for development of National Highways. This makes the total project outlay till date ₹53,678 crore.

Projects included in the new approved list are 24 roads, one reach for the hill highway, three hospitals, one bypass, 56 schools, seven railway overbridges, one flyover, one fishing harbour, and two tourism projects.

Land

KIIFB extends 25% of the cost for acquiring land for National Highway development, which amounts to ₹5,374 crore.

A tripartite agreement has been signed between the State government, KIIFB, and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).

The amount would be released to the owner of the land ceded, based on the recommendation of the District Collector.

The entire series of transactions have been spared from treasury controls.

PWD projects

Minister for Employment T.P. Ramakrishnan told a press conference here on Tuesday that the proposed plantation directorate would work under the Department of Employment with personnel drawn from it initially.

He was speaking after a day-long workshop on the draft of a plantation policy for the State. The workshop was organised under the aegis of Kerala Institute of Labour and Employment.

He said that trade liberalisation and duty-free imports had hit the plantation sector badly in the State. At least a lakh, out of the 3.5 lakh, people employed in the plantation sector had gone out of it due to the economic problems. There were 24 plantations in the public sector. A meeting of the stakeholders would be convened before the plantation policy was finalised. It was the aim of the government to revive the plantations and regenerate employment opportunities, the Minister said.

Work to create a coffee and a tea brand was under way. Coffee from Wayanad would be sold under a specially created brand just as tea produced in Kerala would be sold under another brand to make a more market impact, he said.

199,2020/01/21,Exploring the domains of being,"Acting is about becoming sensorially aware of imagining or remembering. “Consider one dimension of our embodied consciousness, which is also the dimension of our sensorial,” Phillip Zarrilli, actor, director and scholar said, elaborating on ‘Phenomenology of Acting’ in the Special Lecture at the ITFoK on Tuesday.

His play Told by the Wind that was staged on Tuesday was about such a nature of acting when growing awareness would unfold unexplored domains of being.

“It is passive, but also active. It is about listening. When we mindfully attend to something, we take time, it happens through time.”

From this, the theatre practitioner ventured into a contemporary actor’s learning methodology attuned to these concepts; approaching it from the martial arts perspective of being “open to what might happen” instead of anticipating, and how awareness is cultivated and actualised in a performance. They have to perform in a state of not knowing. “We have a score, until it emerges, I do not know what comes next,” he said.

Audience’s role

As actors, we would have to discover by doing and not over-thinking, Mr. Zarrilli said. “It is a series of actions. When I work on it, we do not do analysis. That is for the audience. I should have no anticipation of what flung me or why I am flung. That is the audience’s work. That is not my work as an actor.”

Good response

The 12th edition of International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) witnessed good crowd of theatre enthusiasts from across the world on Tuesday.

The festival that has been conducted with the theme ‘Imagining Communities’ seeks to reflect upon the state of democracy and the need to reflect on alternative voices.

200,2020/01/21,Police intensify search for quack,"The Yeroor police have intensified the search for a quack who endangered the life of a four-year-old boy by prescribing medicines that contained mercury much above the permissible limit.

The boy developed serious health issues and was first admitted to a private hospital at Anchal and then shifted to the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, when his condition worsened.

The quack, known as Laxman Raj, had reportedly distributed the toxic medicine to more than 100 patients in Yeroor, Anchal and Kulathupuzha. The boy was under treatment for a skin disease.

“So far we have received only one complaint, but we spoke to many patients.

201,2020/01/21,"Mask, the saviour of lungs","Changes in the climate, air pollution and occupational health hazards are some of the causes for the increase in lung diseases among people, say pulmonologists. However, without a registry on the causes, there are no yardsticks to measure what kind of disease is affecting the majority.

But cases of lung diseases caused by exposure to environmental pollution, dust or other occupational hazards can be limited when protective gears like masks are used, say experts.

At workplace

A mask would make a big difference to the health of people who are exposed to certain pollutants on a regular basis, like those working in prawn-peeling industry, masala making and packaging industry, granite quarries, plywood industries, furniture shops and so on. The number of people reaching the outpatient departments for treatments had definitely gone up, said Dr. Sophia Philip, president of the Cochin Thoracic Society.

“At our end, we do help them understand why it is important to wear a mask at their workplace. There are industries which do supply protective gear, but there is no insistence on wearing them,” said Dr. Philip, assistant professor, Government Medical College, Ernakulam.

Most industries do not educate the workers on the need for wearing a protective gear, she added. Ten years into working in a furniture shop or prawn peeling unit, people might complain of lung diseases.

Exposure to pollutants over a long period affect a person’s health. Those who are genetically prone to obstructive lung diseases like asthama could be affected by such exposure within a couple of years or less, said Dr. Philip.

Prevents transmission

Wearing a mask manages to limit exposure as well as transmission of diseases. Patients are advised on the need to follow basic hygiene practices such as using a towel during coughing and sneezing as diseases like TB could infect those in close contact in family too, she added.

As most of the respiratory diseases have similar symptoms, like cough, sputum, running nose, wheezing, a history of the disease bouts would be a great guide for the doctor to arrive at the correct diagnosis, said Dr. Anitha Thilakan, assistant professor, Ernakulam Medical College.

Treatments and further probe usually depend on how long the person had been suffering from the symptoms, she added.

“Queries on working atmosphere are important as it give an idea about exposure to any particular allergen or pollutant,” said Dr. Philip.

Lifestyle

Lifestyle is yet another aspect that could aggravate a condition, especially if one is a smoker or is exposed to passive smoking.

Viral infections are more prevalent when smog is in the atmosphere. The smog droplets settle down near the inhalation area and tend to spread the bacteria or the virus very fast. The doctors prescribe annual vaccination for those who are prone to infections on a regular basis, said Dr. Philip.

Treatment

Pointing out how dosage of drugs and the kind of drugs differ for different diseases, Dr. Thilakan said there are patients who buy drugs over-the-counter for what they suspect was similar to an infection earlier. Some could be using an old prescription too. This is a dangerous trend, she said.

Issues related to climate change also cause infections among people, she said.

The kind of climate in a season was known earlier, but now it is varying, she said. People are caught between a mix of a chill and heat in night time and daytime weather. Spells of rain, sunshine and chill had specific seasonal durations earlier that cautioned people on their daily routines. There is little difference now, said Dr. Thilakan.

Samples tested in the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) laboratory in Bhopal have confirmed the malady as lumpy skin disease (LSD), a condition that causes chronic debility, reduced milk production, poor growth, lack of appetite, infertility and abortion.

LSD was confirmed by the end of December. But the government decided to hush it up fearing panic among the farmers.

Vaccine soon

As it is a viral disease, there is no direct treatment for LSD.

Vaccines too are not available in the State against this disease.

The government is trying to get the vaccine imported. Animal Husbandry Department officials said that vaccine was expected to reach the State in a day or two.

The Animal Husbandry Department has fought the disease silently by conducting a door-to-door awareness drive among the dairy farmers of Palakkad, Thrissur and Malappuram districts.

610 cases in Palakkad

As many as 610 cases were reported in Palakkad alone. The disease was first reported from Kizhakkanchery and Nemmara in the district.

As many as 42 grama panchayats in Palakkad have reported this disease so far.

Under control

“But there is nothing to panic. It is now under control,” said Animal Husbandry Department’s district public relations officer (PRO) Joju Davis. He said farmers were aware of the dangers of the LSD, and they were dealing with it effectively.

Veterinarians said LSD caused by Capripoxvirus in animals was similar to chickenpox in human beings. It took about a week for the viral attack to subside. If neglected, the lumps on the cow’s body could rupture and cause debilitating wounds. If not treated, the wounds could invite maggots.

Antibiotics

Farmers said that they were advised to clean the wounds and apply antibiotics. However, lack of appetite followed by a drastic fall in milk production has caused angst among the farmers. They said if the disease was not controlled now, it would seriously affect milk production in the State at a time when the State was cruising ahead with the agenda of self-sustenance in milk production.

LSD virus spreads through fluids or insect bites. “Preventing insect bites is very important now,” said Dr. Davis. He also said that there was no harm in drinking the milk of an affected cow.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/f6ys9e/article30618927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvmpmLumpySkinDisease,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lsd-in-cows-worries-farmers/article30618928.ece
204,2020/01/21,Withdrawal of solar boat puts people to difficulty,"Aditya, the country’s first solar-powered passenger boat, has been withdrawn from service for periodical maintenance.

The boat, which operates in the Vaikom-Thavankkadavu route connecting Kottayam and Alappuzha districts, has suspended its services since December 28. The sudden stoppage of the boat services in one of the busiest routes in the State has caused much inconvenience to the travelling public.

According to State Water Transport Department (SWTD) officials, the vessel is currently dry-docked at a yard in Aroor and will return after an inspection by the Indian Registrar of Shipping. They sought to dispel the speculations about the financial crunch experienced by the department affecting the boat’s return in a time-bound manner.

“The vessel, which has completed three years of service, is undergoing the mandatory repair work and will be back in service in three weeks from now. The relaunch will be done along with a celebration to mark the completion of its three years of service,” said Shaji V. Nair, Director, State Water Transport Department.

Saves money

Launched on January 12, 2017, Aditya sailed a distance of 38,577 km and served 6.43 lakh passengers in the first two years of its operation. It also helped the SWTD save 58,450 litres of diesel worth ₹40.91 lakh , in addition to 1.26 lakh kg of carbon emission. The service, according to the officials, has incurred an expense of ₹250 a day, as against the average daily expense of ₹8,000 for diesel-powered ferries.

Meanwhile, the SWTD is all set to launch its AC fast ferry boat between Kottayam and Alappuzha in the first week of February. The twin-engine catamaran-type boat, with a seating capacity of 120 seats with air-conditioning facility for 40 seats, will cover the 32-km water route in 90 minutes. “The work on the vessel is over and it will soon undergo a fitness test. We are awaiting the convenience of the Chief Minister to carry out its formal launch,” said Mr.Nair.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9kx45q/article30618912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv22solarferrys,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/withdrawal-of-solar-boat-puts-people-to-difficulty/article30618907.ece
205,2020/01/21,Vaikom Satyagraha museum inaugurated,"The State government is examining a proposal to takeover the boat jetty at Vaikom where Mahatma Gandhi had disembarked a boat for joining the famous satyagraha in the temple town. It may made a part of the Vaikom Satyagraha museum project, Minister for Archives and Archaeology Kadannappally Ramachandran has said.

He was inaugurating the Vaikom Satyagraha Museum established by the Archives Department in Vaikom on Tuesday.

According to the Minister, the museum is the State’s tribute to the Father of the Nation on the occasion of his 150th birth year.

For young minds

“The museum, which narrates the story of an epic struggle for social equality, will also serve as a platform for introducing the young minds to the ideals of Gandhism,” he said.

C.K. Asha, MLA, presided over the function. J. Reji Kumar, Director, State Archives, gave the introductory speech. R.Chandran Pillai, Executive Director, Kerala Museum, presented a report.

The museum has put on display several hundreds of documents relating to the satyagraha and hosts a special gallery to narrate Gandhiji’s role in the historic movement.

206,2020/01/21,Alert on water-borne diseases,"With the temperature soaring high, the Health Department has issued an alert urging the public to take basic precautionary measures to avoid dehydration and water-borne diseases.

Those who are travelling or remain exposed to sun from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. have been advised to use loose cotton clothes and sunblock lotion.

Since there is a high chance for dehydration, increasing the intake of water is also important. Headache, muscle cramps, excessive sweating, fatigue and dizziness are the symptoms of dehydration and at times excessive exposure to the sun can lead to paralysis.

Proper shade

People experiencing a rise in body temperature should be moved to places with proper shade and their body should be wiped with cotton dipped in cold water.

As many parts of the district are already hit by water shortage, there is the risk of getting infected with water-borne diseases.

“Drink boiled water to prevent the outbreak of water-borne diseases such as cholera, typhoid and jaundice. There is also a possibility for chickenpox outbreaks,” said the District Medical Officer.

Avoid self-medication

The department has instructed the public to avoid self-medication and get professional help from the nearest government hospital.

Those coming into contact with contaminated water should take doxycycline as a precautionary measure against leptospirosis.

Since stagnant water is an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, all containers should be kept covered to avoid vector-borne diseases.

Larve density

In a recently conducted survey it was found that mosquito larve density is high in many places in the district, including some areas coming under the Corporation limits.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/alert-on-water-borne-diseases/article30618877.ece

208,2020/01/21,Age-old Karippel canal in Kanjikuzhy block panchayat brought back to life,"Collective efforts have brought an age-old canal back to life in Kanjikuzhy block panchayat.

The Karippel canal, once a navigable waterway and a source of water for irrigating paddy fields in the area, had lost its glory due to encroachments and waste dumping.

In January 2019, the Kanjikuzhy block panchayat and Cherthala South and Kadakkarappally grama panchayats jointly launched an initiative under the Haritha Keralam Mission to restore its past glory.

The block panchayat earmarked ₹28 lakh, while the two grama panchayats together contributed ₹27 lakh. Almost a year later, water has once again started to flow freely in the canal and it is becoming home to a thriving shoal of fish.

“Several years ago, the canal was the lifeline of Cherthala South and Kadakkarappally panchayats. It started to lose its glory three decades ago due to accumulation of silt and waste dumping. Absence of free flow of water has resulted in flooding of the area during the monsoon seasons. As many as 100 families living on the banks of the canal were the worst affected, as they were forced to shift to relief camps every rainy season. The project has helped to restore the canal and lives of the people living on its banks,” said an official.

Encroachments

The Karippel canal is 12 km long and had a width of 85 metres. But encroachments have reduced the width of the canal in many places to a mere six metres. As part of the project, silt and waste accumulated in the canal were removed. Later, the canal was deepened to ensure flow of water. They also laid coir geotextiles to protect the banks of the waterbody. Besides, footpaths were constructed and saplings planted in the area.

Officials further said that the Kanjikuzhy block panchayat would soon launch a project to clean up a tributary of the Karippel canal flowing through Pattanakad grama panchayat.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cft1jc/article30618857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv22canalalps,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/age-old-karippel-canal-in-kanjikuzhy-block-panchayat-brought-back-to-life/article30618852.ece
209,2020/01/21,Tension over bid to take over churches,"The standoff between the Jacobite and Orthodox factions of the Malankara Church continues over the control of parishes as the police and revenue authorities failed to takeover the Kothamangalam Marthoman Cheriyapally and St. Mary’s Church, Odakkali, near Perumbavoor, on Tuesday.

Personnel from the Kurummpady police station entered the compound of St. Mary’s Church but were prevented from taking control of the church to implement the Supreme Court order. Police sources said a large posse of police personnel tried to take over the church.

Locking themselves

However, a substantially large group of Jacobites entered the church and locked themselves inside.

The personnel continued to be outside the church for the better part of the day even as the Jacobites continued to be inside the church, offering prayers. At the Kothamangalam church, Muvattupuzha Revenue Divisional Officer M.T. Anil Kumar arrived with a group of policemen to take over the church.

However, those assembled before the church prevented them from entering the church or completing the formalities. A report on the happenings at the Kothamangalam church would be submitted to the District Collector.

Sources said it were members of the Matha Maithri Samrakshana Samiti, an all-religion group, that spoke with the revenue and police officials at the Kothamangalam church. The group has been on vigil for over a month against the possible takeover of the church as per the Supreme Court order. The court on July 3, 2017 ruled that the churches should be handed over to the Orthodox faction and parallel administration, including parallel services, should end. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Orthodox faction said there was lack of political will on the part of the government to implement the court order even though the State had sworn to implement it.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fl5au0/article30619152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TVPALLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tension-over-bid-to-take-over-churches/article30618838.ece
210,2020/01/21,CAA conundrum may reflect in budget session,"The rift between the State government and Governor Arif Mohammad Khan over the State moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is likely to resonate in the budget session of the Assembly beginning January 30.

The Cabinet on Wednesday is likely to approve the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s policy address to be delivered at the Assembly and forward it for Mr. Khan’s clearance. If the present mood in the State on the CAA is any indication, the sentiment shared by the government and the Opposition on the issue may get reflected in the address.

Sources familiar with legislature procedures told The Hindu that even if Mr. Khan decides to skip the references on the CAA, it may not cause an embarrassment to the government, since such instances had occurred in the Kerala and West Bengal Assembly earlier.

Since the Assembly is moving to a paperless e-platform, the pages being read by the Governor would figure on the computer screens of the members.

Whether the Governor reads the full address or skips certain portions, former Speakers had ruled that only the complete text of the address circulated among the members would be deemed as the government’s policy.

Hence, if Mr. Khan refuses to read references to the CAA, it would not put the government in a spot, sources say.

But any show of protest in the Assembly against Mr. Khan from the Opposition when he arrives to deliver the address may stand out as a jarring note.

Balan’s stand

A thaw in the relations has become imperative for both sides, especially since Law Minister A.K. Balan has been repeatedly clarifying that the government is not on a confrontational course.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has been trying to maintain a placatory tone to prevent the wrangling from aggravating into a deep crisis.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/caa-conundrum-may-reflect-in-budget-session/article30618822.ece

212,2020/01/21,Rubber check dams to be set up in Kasaragod,"Kasaragod is set to become the first district in the State to construct rubber check dams for water conservation and flood prevention.

The project was approved by the district level committee of the Kasargod Development Package at a meeting chaired by District Collector D. Sajith Babu.

Special Officer E.P. Rajamohan told The Hindu that in the first phase, rubber check dams would be built in five areas in the district. The project was being implemented by the Irrigation Department with technical assistance from the Indian Institute of Water Management, a Central Government agency under the ICAR of Bhubaneswar.

The five areas were selected after a team of experts from the ICAR visited the sites and approved the construction of the dams, he said.

The first phase of the project would be at the Madhu Vahini Puzha in Madhur panchayat; Alanthatta-Nappachal Thodu in Kayyu Cheemeni panchayat; Maniyattuthottu in Pilicode panchayat; Manjeswaram Puzha in Vorkady panchaya; and Manadukkam-Erinjalamkode Thodu in Panathady panchayat. He said that ₹2.43 crore had been set apart for the development of the check dams.

The new concept of rubber check dam was implemented in Ooty and other places such as Odisha, he said. Unlike concrete dams, rubber check dams were more durable. The dam would last 15 to 25 years and it would have a storage height of 1.5 m to 2.5 m.

“The biggest advantage of the dam is that when the water level rises during floods or heavy rain, it can be easily released,” he said.

The team of experts from the Irrigation Department had taken the decision to implement the project after a visit to the rubber check dam constructed in Ooty, Mr. Rajamohan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/orbgfx/article30618546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200121-WA0029,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rubber-check-dams-to-be-set-up-in-kasaragod/article30618548.ece

214,2020/01/21,Chennithala visits suspected Maoists’ parents,"Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala on Tuesday visited the parents of Alan Shuhaib and Thaha Fasal who had been arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) for alleged connection with Maoists at their houses here.

Speaking to journalists, Mr. Chennithala said that his visit was as part of the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) taking up the issue. “The police have not followed the mandatory procedures in arresting them under the UAPA. If Alan and Thaha were Maoists, the Chief Minister should produce evidence to prove that,” he said.

Humanitarian grounds

He also likened Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and said that the UDF was taking up the case on humanitarian grounds. “The issue would again be raised in the Assembly. We do not want to take political mileage out of the issue,” he said. The visit of Mr. Chennithala comes a day after Indian Union Muslim League leader M.K. Muneer visited the houses of Alan and Thaha on Monday.

“Prima facie it appears no procedures have been followed in charging them under the UAPA. On what basis the Chief Minister was accusing them of Maoist links,” he asked, urging Mr. Vijayan to come out with details.

Alan and Thaha, students of law and journalism respectively of the Kannur University, had been taken into custody by the Kozhikode police on November 1. They were attached to the Meenchanda and Paramal branches respectively under the South area committee of the CPI(M) in the district.

215,2020/01/21,Sabarimala temple closes after a peaceful pilgrimage season,"After a peaceful Mandalam-Makaravilakku pilgrimage season of over two-months, the portals of the Lord Ayyappa Temple here were closed after performing customary rituals and pujas on Tuesday.

Though the annual Makaravilakku was held on January 15, the hill top temple, nestled in a reserve forest in the Western Ghats, was open for devotees to offer worship till Monday evening.

Even the last day of the pilgrimage witnessed heavy rush of devotees, including those from neighbouring states, at the Sannidhanam (temple complex), sources at the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB), the apex temple body, which manages the shrine, said.

Customary rites like ‘aashtadrvya mahaganapathi homam,’ ’abhishekam’ and ‘usha nivedyam’, were performed under the aegis of tantri (head priest) Mahesh Mohanaru in the early hours of Tuesday.

In accordance with the tradition, the royal designate of the Pandalam Palace, where according to legend Lord Ayyappa had spent his childhood, offered prayers before the sanctum sanctorum.

Also read: Kalabhabhishekom ritual performed at Sabarimala

He later led the procession carrying the sacred jewels ‘thiruvabharanam’, brought here to be adorned on Lord Ayyappa on the day of Makaravilakku, back to the Palace.

Melsanthi (chief priest), A K Sudheer Namboothiri performed the ‘bhasmabhishekam’, the offering of holy ash, on the idol of the Lord Ayyappa and closed the doors of the sanctum sanctorum singing ‘harivarasanam’, the sacred lullaby, marking the culmination of over 60-day pilgrimage season.

The hillock temple would be opened on February 13, for monthly pooja and would receive devotees for the next five days, TDB sources added.

The shrine, which draws devotees from various parts of the country, had witnessed unprecedented protests last year following the order lifting the traditional ban on women and girls in menstrual age from offering prayers.

However, this year, against the backdrop of the top court’s decision to refer a batch of review pleas against its earlier verdict to a larger bench, the state government had said those women desirous of visiting the hill temple should get a court order and it would not encourage activism.

During this season, some young women who came to Sabarimala were not allowed by authorities to trek to the Ayyappa temple.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/hkg0u1/article30611289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20ptkrk07-pilgrGK870KHPH5jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarimala-temple-closes-after-a-peaceful-pilgrimage-season/article30614020.ece
216,2020/01/21,Maradu: movement of flat debris may be hit,"The private agency entrusted with the removal of about 76,000 tonnes of debris that emerged following the demolition of four apartment buildings at Maradu has sought the permission of the State Pollution Control Board to set up a Construction and Demolition Waste processing plant.

The representatives of the agency made a presentation before Ajit Haridas, Chairman of the board, in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday. They elaborated on the steps being planned to process the construction and demolition waste. Even though there was lack of clarity on the site chosen for setting up the plant, board sources hinted that they had plans to set up the facility at Kumbalam.

“Let them first submit the application for establishing the construction and demolition waste management plant,” they said when pointed out that the Kumbalam panchayat had refused to grant permission for shifting the debris to any site under the local body’s jurisdiction fearing that it might create problems for residents. Seetha Chakrapani, chairperson of Kumbalam panchayat, said the local body was yet to receive any official request from the agency. “Kumbalam is a small panchayat by size and lacked the space for processing such waste,” she said.

The contractors seem to have informed the board authorities that they might transport a certain percentage of the demolition waste to a crusher facility. Board officials pointed out that the agency would have to submit the details of the crusher and its location before proceeding with the shifting of the debris.

Clear plan needed

“Moreover, they should also give us a clear plan on the site proposed for setting up the Construction and Demolition Waste processing plant. The survey number of the plot and other geographical details need to be presented as part of submitting the application for establishment and operation of the proposed facility. The agency should also ensure that the plant will not be set up in a wetland or a property in which any type of construction cannot be permitted in view of the coastal regulation or other norms under the Environment Act,” they said. As per the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016, the operator of the plant should obtain authorisation from the State Pollution Control Board to run the facility. The processing or recycling site must be away from habitation clusters, forest areas, waterbodies, monuments, national parks, wetlands and places of important cultural, historical or religious interest.

The plants having a capacity exceeding five tonnes per day have to maintain a buffer zone of no development around the facility. The operator should check indiscriminate disposal and ensure scientific conversion of the construction and demolition waste into useful raw material for buildings and construction.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/atnet2/article30612677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21KIDEBRIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/maradu-movement-of-flat-debris-may-be-hit/article30612678.ece

Speaking to The Hindu on Monday, M.P. Kunhikanaran, central committee member, CPI(ML), said braving harsh weather, as many as 150 landless people under the aegis of the AIKKS and the ABM had been on an indefinite agitation in front of the collectorate here since April 24.

They began the strike after they were evicted from a piece of vested forestland at Thovarimala under the Meppadi Forest Range in the South Wayanad Forest Division. The agitation is not to get a three-cent plot for the landless, but to ensure land and house for the marginalised sections who had been denied land following land reforms, he added.

However, the Government is yet to address the demands of the agitators, he said. The protesters will take out a march to the Secretariat in Thiruvananthapuram on January 22 demanding steps to provide land and houses to the landless, Mr. Kunhikannan said.

Saurav Yadav, general secretary, ABM, will inaugurate the march at 10 a.m. on the day.

221,2020/01/21,Bobby Simha on playing the antagonist in Ravi Teja's 'Disco Raja' and not being a regular 'villain',"Bobby Simha is very candid in his attitude and is not afraid to speak his mind. This week his film Disco Raja will be releasing and he is playing an antagonist. This isn’t his Telugu debut though, earlier his film Run (Neram, in Tamil) and a little known Yedhaina Jaragocchu came out last year. But this will be his first straight big film in Telugu.

Ask him about the gap post Yedhaina Jaragocchu, and he says, “I got many offers after that, but didn't want to play regular villain roles. Why should I be doing what everyone can do? This is the ideal time to look out for strong scripts in Telugu. There is so much content-driven stuff coming up but I wasn’t happy with my roles. So I stayed away. Luckily I got this offer from director Vi Anand, he narrated story that was backed by good content.”

Most actors, if they are not well established in the industry, are being taken to play cameos, villains and character roles in star films without getting their due. Bobby Simha is aware of it and says he isn’t too particular about being a hero or a villain. He stresses, “Who leads the scripts, who disturbs the scripts or drives it is important. There is nothing such as negative or positive, if people like a performance they will flock to see it. We might choose the right story and role but while executing it, something goes missing and we have no control over that. Disco Raja is a commercial content-oriented film. The director is known for his concept films but he is brilliant in balancing all aspects. Ravi Teja is obviously entertaining and I play a gangster in the movie. There is BGM running for every actor, so it depends on how each character handles the situation musically in Disco Raja.”

Adds Bobby, “I did ask Vi Anand in Chennai as to why he chose me. He said the team felt I would do a far better job.”

Named Jaisimha Bobby, Bobby — as his friends address him — was born in Moulali but his family moved to Kodaikanal in 1995. He moved to Chennai and for three years he worked in theatre and short films, which helped him improve his Tamil. He got his big break in Tamil after a lot of struggle. Bobby had completed around 25 films in seven years and keeps upgrading his work with constant feedback from friends. He keeps reinventing himself. The tone of the people changes with every debacle which is why he trusts cinema and not cinema people, he says.

Bobby is also working on a web series in Tamil and says it is a good platform for actors. He points out, “OTT platoform lets us enjoy more than six to eight hours. There is no censoring and even after ten years you can revisit it. It is like a library.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/uew983/article30615096.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym22bobby1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bobby-simha-on-playing-the-antagonist-in-ravi-tejas-disco-raja-and-not-being-a-regular-villain/article30615100.ece
222,2020/01/21,‘Legacy can become baggage’: 'Lifeu Ishtene' actor Samyukta Hornad,"The 2011 film Lifeu Ishtene, directed by Pawan Kumar, was a comedy revolving around the complexities of relationships. Not only was the story unusual for its time (when remakes and family dramas dominated the Kannada industry), but the film also marked the debut of Samyukta Hornad who played the lead opposite Diganth.

With her dusky complexion, natural looks and curly locks, Samyukta came as a breath of fresh air.

She also has a huge legacy to live up to as she is the granddaughter of theatre and film actor Bhargavi and the late make-up artist Narayana (better known as make up Nani), she is Sudha Belawadi’s daughter and Prakash Belawadi’s niece.

From her debut film where she plays an aspiring journalist to her current project, Hondisi Bareyiri, where she plays an activist and upcoming film, Omlette, where she plays an ambitious woman, Samyukta has made it a point to play strong-willed characters.

She shared the screen with Prakash Raj in trilingual film, Un Samayal Arayi apart from acting in films such as Jigarthanda, Maarikondavaru (a remake of Hindi film Ankur), Dayavittu Gamanisi, Arishadvarga, MMCH Kaafi Thota, and Sarkari Kelasa Devara Kelasa.

Currently shooting for a Telugu web series in Hyderabad, Samyukta speaks to MetroPlus over the phone.

Edited excerpts:

What is the project you are working on in Hyderabad?

I cannot say much. But it is my second web series in Telugu. I play a dark character which I am enjoying. It is a great team.

You always choose roles that are unconventional. Is that intentional?

I have grown up watching Smita Patil and Shabana Azmi’s films. I still talk about their work. I too want to be remembered like that 10 years down the line. So with a little patience, I waited and slowly roles that I wanted started coming my way.

In fact, when I was offered the role (that Shabana plays) in Marikondavaru, I dropped everything and rushed to the set. I think my decision to choose a role comes from a funny place where I want the character to have the right impact on women. That is what has driven me till date. Yet, I want to do all kinds of roles but at the end the girl, should have a purpose or justification for her actions in the story.

You come from a family of theatre stalwarts. Does that put pressure on you as an artiste?

As each is a legend in his or her own way, I need to be more responsible as an actor. Also I believe I am what I am, not because of my upbringing but also because of who I am. Sometimes the legacy also becomes baggage.

Did you learn the art of make-up from your grandfather?

No... I am terrible at make-up. But I was a model for him since I was five or six. He would transform my face to anything and I would be fascinated with it. I also feel privileged to have that kind of exposure. My grandmother was my first director. One day she just put me on stage and became my director. I also used to cue actors on stage. It was a gradual learning process.

Tell us about your role in Omelette .

Everyone is chasing something and we are in a race. There is pressure to win something. And this girl is aggressively chasing her career, is never satisfied and does not care for relationships, with parents, colleagues and friends. The film is a story about self-discovery making you wonder if she ever learns to love herself.

How was it to work with Prakash Raj?

A wonderful experience. When he saw my début film and called for a meeting, I went with make-up and had even straightened my hair. He rejected me. I returned home and put up a sad photo of myself as my DP. He asked me if I was the same girl. I was called back. They washed my face and hair and I got the role. It took me five more years to be myself. I am not sure how much of the ladder I can climb but I know that what I am doing is satisfying.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/u67yz/article30614257.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20bgmhornad4jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/legacy-can-become-baggage-lifeu-ishtene-actor-samyukta-hornad/article30614259.ece
223,2020/01/21,Deepika Padukone addresses ‘love-hate relationship with mental illness’ at World Economic Forum,"Deepika Padukone on Monday said people must understand depression and anxiety are like any other illness and can be treated and her own experience has encouraged her to work for this cause.

“My love and hate relationship with this has taught me a lot and I want to tell everyone suffering from this that you are not alone,” she said while recalling her own struggle with depression and mental illness.

“One trillion dollars is the estimated impact of depression and mental illness on the world economy,” she said while receiving the annual Crystal Award on the first evening of the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2020 held in Davos.

“In the time it has taken me to accept this award, the world has lost one more person to suicide,” she said.

“Depression is a common yet serious illness. It is important to understand that anxiety and depression is like any other illness and treatable. It was experience with this illness that encouraged me to set up Live Love Laugh,” she said while talking about the foundation she has set up for this cause.

Padukone was given the award for her leadership in raising mental health awareness, which she did by going public with her own experience with anxiety and depression.

Motivated by her own experience, she set up her foundation to provide awareness programs in schools in India, funding for free psychiatric treatment, medical education programs, public awareness campaigns and more.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pf3287/article30614146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWITZERLANDDAVOSFORUM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/deepika-padukone-addresses-love-hate-relationship-with-mental-illness-at-world-economic-forum/article30614147.ece

But Prasanna, who was seen in Thupparivalan and will soon be seen in Mafia, is not very perturbed and is looking forward to teaming up with Ajith sometime in the future. “Inspite of the deep disappointment, I am feeling all the more stronger with all your love. There is always a next time and am sure I will be playing that dream part opposite Thala soon.”

225,2020/01/21,Analysis: DMK-Congress swift patch-up demonstrates pragmatism on the part of both parties,"The swiftness displayed by the leadership of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the Congress in thrashing out their differences over sharing posts for rural local bodies (RLBs) demonstrates pragmatism on the part of both parties.

While the DMK would not like to get distracted from its primary objective of returning to power in the Assembly elections, due in April-May next year, the national party does not want to lose its long-time ally at a time when it is increasingly seen as “friendless” at the all-India level.

The convergence of interests has, among others, facilitated the breaking of the ice. Other constituents of the DMK-led combine had also communicated to it that they want it to sort out the problem with the Congress at the earliest.

The trouble began when Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) president K.S. Alagiri and Congress Legislature Party leader K.R. Ramasamy issued a statement on January 10, accusing the DMK of violating the “coalition dharma” by allotting only two of the 303 chairpersons of panchayat unions and not conceding a single post of chairperson of district panchayats. A few days later, the DMK chose to boycott a meeting convened by Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). What followed later was a sharp exchange of words between second-rung leaders of both parties.

The controversy also erupted at a time when veteran film star Rajinikanth was getting drawn into one political issue or the other.

As the relationship between the two parties took a serious turn during the course of the previous week, many political observers speculated two scenarios: the Congress aligning itself with the AIADMK or with Mr. Rajnikanth in the event of his launching a party.

It was against this backdrop that the DMK and the Congress, on Saturday last, decided to bring the controversy to an end.

Enthused by the outcome of the December 2019 polls to rural local bodies in 27 districts in which the DMK and its allies had managed to be ahead of the ruling AIADMK-led front despite raising a number of objections over the poll process, the DMK seems to have realised that every move that it is going to take in the coming months should be directed towards achieving success in the Assembly polls. “The message that we got after today’s meeting of the DMK executive committee is that the leadership wants us to act cohesively in the next round of local bodies’ elections which should continue till the Assembly polls,” said a functionary.

The DMK leadership is also aware that it cannot afford yet another defeat which means that it will not be in power for 15 years at a stretch. Ever since the DMK captured power for the first time in 1967, the longest spell of remaining out of power was 13 years (January 1976 – January 1989). The party and its principal adversary, AIADMK, shared power, alternatively, between 1984 and 2011.

Though the Congress’ vote share had shrunk over the years, it still has some base in the southern parts of the State and in Tier-II and Tier-III towns. When the party contested on its own in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, it did not win a single seat but polled 17.5 lakh votes in 39 constituencies with a vote share of 4.3%. And as a partner of the DMK in the 2019 parliamentary polls, it got about 54 lakh votes with around 13% of valid votes polled in the State.

Besides, a section of religious minorities has been a steady source of support to it.

Apparently, the Saturday meeting took place at the initiative of the high command of the Congress, which is keen on retaining every ally, more so a strong ally such as the DMK, at this juncture. This was reflected when a delegation of senior TNCC leaders including Mr. Alagiri, Mr. Ramasamy and former TNCC chief K.V. Thangkabalu, went to the DMK headquarters and met party president M.K. Stalin. Even as they expressed their willingness to work with the DMK, the latter had again communicated its displeasure over the January 10 statement.

At a time when the State is experiencing protest after protest over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, all those who are against the BJP-led government would like to reap the political dividends which can be realised in the immediate run when the urban local bodies’ polls are held along with elections for rural local bodies in nine districts. It is after considering all these factors that the DMK and the Congress, according to leaders of both parties, have buried the hatchet.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/tz7dby/article30616637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-dmk-congress-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/analysis-dmk-congress-swift-patch-up-demonstrates-pragmatism-on-the-part-of-both-parties/article30616595.ece

At a media interaction, a journalist asked Mr Stalin about the actor stating that he would not apologise for certain comments he made about an anti-superstition rally in Salem in 1971 in which Periyar participated at the golden jubilee meet of Tamil magazine Thuglak. Responding, the DMK leader said, “Rajinikanth is not a politician. He is an actor.

227,2020/01/21,Students of classes 5 and 8 in TN to write public exams in their own schools,"While the School Education Department had initially considered conducting public exams for classes 5 and 8 in common centres, students will now be writing the exams in their own schools.

A senior official from the department said that the exams will be conducted in the same schools that the students are studying in. “The students will not be inconvenienced in any way and officials at the district level will coordinate and conduct the exam,” he said. The department will issue an official circular to this effect in the next few days.

The possible idea of conducting these exams at common centres had been met with opposition from several quarters. P.K. Ilamaran, President of the Tamil Nadu Teachers Association, said that in villages and smaller districts, it would have been impossible to ensure that common centres for students of class 5 were within a 1 km radius from their schools. “It is unfair to make young students in these places travel so much when they have to take up exams. It might have been easy to designate schools as common centres in cities but not in rural areas,” he explained.

For the conduct of these exams, the Department of Elementary Education had asked for district-level committees to be set up under Chief Educational Officers, which will also have officials from the elementary education department, directorate of government examinations, District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) and heads of schools. While students of class 5 will take up the exams only in English, Maths and Tamil, students of class 8 will write the exams in all 5 subjects.

The announcement to conduct public exams for classes 5 and 8 had been met with stiff opposition from several teachers, students and academicians who felt that it was unnecessary for the State to burden younger students and make them write 5 public exams from class 5 to 12.

Speaking on the sidelines of an event in the city today, K.A. Sengottaiyan, Minister for School Education said that the aim behind conducting the exams was not to burden the students, but to assess their learning levels.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/e113ia/article30614682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21JANTH--SCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/students-of-classes-5-and-8-to-write-public-exams-in-their-own-schools/article30614683.ece
228,2020/01/21,DMK to hold all party meet of its alliance on January 24,"The DMK has convened a meeting of all parties in the Secular Progressive Alliance in Tamil Nadu on January 24, to discuss the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens and take a decision on the next steps of action to oppose these legislations.

Speaking to reporters after an urgent meeting of the DMK’s executive committee on Tuesday, DMK president M.K. Stalin said the parties will discuss and decide on the course of action over the CAA-NRC-NPR.

The DMK passed a resolution in the meeting asking the ruling AIADMK to announce that it would not allow implementation of the CAA-NPR-NRC in Tamil Nadu. The meeting also passed a resolution condemning the AIADMK’s stand on dual citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees living in India.

“Even after the ruling BJP at the Centre told the High Court that there is no provision for giving citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamil refugees under the CAA, the AIADMK is continuously saying it will offer dual citizenship. This meeting condemns the AIADMK for being vengeful against the Sri Lankan Tamils,” it said.

The meeting also demanded that the Indian government offer citizenship to Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka living in India if they desire to become Indian citizens.

When asked about Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi opposing the MoEF’s amendment to the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, exempting the hydrocarbon project proposed in the Cauvery delta region from public consultations, Mr. Stalin said this was just a drama enacted by the AIADMK.

“State Environment Minister K. C. Karuppannan has written a letter to the Prime Minister and has also spoken about not having to take the opinion of people for such projects. Suddenly, the CM says he’s opposing the amendment. This is all a drama. This government does not have the guts to question the Centre,” he said.

The Executive Committee meeting also passed various resolutions condemning the AIADMK government on issues such as NEET, rising fuel prices, milk prices, unemployment, public examinations for students of 5th and 8th standards, detention of people who are engaged in peaceful protests against the CAA-NRC and the book-fair controversy where speakers were stopped mid-way from expressing their views among others.

In his speech, Rajinikanth had said that Periyar has held an anti-superstition rally in which naked pictures of Lord Ram and Sita were paraded in public and garlanded with slippers.

Periyarist organisations such as Dravidar Kazhagam, Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam and Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam had objected to the speech on the basis that it was factually incorrect. TPDK general secretary Kovai Ramakrishnan had said that the actor must apologise for his speech or face protests.

231,2020/01/21,NGT says environmental clearance a must before starting construction projects,"The Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in a recent order, has insisted on the sanctity of getting necessary environmental clearances (ECs) before starting construction projects.

In two recent orders, it came down heavily on two construction agencies based on petitions that they had not received ECs before proceeding with construction. In one instance, a private builder in Chennai was restrained from proceeding with constructing a 27-floor apartment complex in Tondiarpet and the NGT has asked authorities to take action against the builder for violating EC guidelines. In the second instance, the NGT imposed a fine of ₹8 crore on a builder in Coimbatore.

In the first case, a case was filed Voora Property Developers Pvt Ltd claiming the builder had proceeded to construct the property without obtaining Environmental Clearance. The State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA) and the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board were directed to form a joint committee, and submit a factual report. The committee informed the NGT that construction of the foundation work had been completed without obtaining the EC. Counsel for the builder submitted before the Tribunal that they had stopped the work and the application for the EC was pending with the EIAA. The counsel submitted that the builder will proceed with construction only after getting the necessary EC.

The Tribunal observed: “As per the EIA Notification, 2006, the project cannot proceed without getting prior Environmental Clearance except to the extent of construction of temporary fencing and some temporary sheds for the guards. The photographs show that foundation work has been done without getting EC,” the bench said.

The bench directed the builder to restrain from proceeding with further construction without getting EC and meeting other required conditions and directed authorities to initiate action after giving the company reasonable opportunity to respond. The bench also directed the Committee to assess the environmental compensation for the violation and submit a compliance report within two months.

Coimbatore builder

The NGT imposed a fine of ₹8 crore on a builder as environmental damages for constructing 340 residential flats in Keeranathan Village in Coimbatore without obtaining EC, and ordered M/S KGISL Technologies and Infrastructure Pvt Ltd to deposit the money with the Central Pollution Control Board within two months.

The applicant alleged that the builder began construction activities and only after substantial progress was made, had applied for prior environmental clearance. He said this fact was established in a letter issued by the SEIAA to the department of Environment and Forest, Tamil Nadu. He sought a direction to the authorities “to demolish the unauthorised and unlawful construction, initiate legal action under the Air and Water Act, and impose damages to pay environmental compensation”.

The Tribunal ordered the company to pay environmental compensation of ₹8 crore on Tuesday and directed a committee to be formed to submit an inspection report.

Counsel for the builder told The Hindu that the company had been denied natural justice. “We are of the opinion that we have clearly been denied natural justice and hence we can approach the high court to stay the order and request for review of the same,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tormp4/article30613175.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21JANTH-NGT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ngt-says-environmental-clearance-a-must-before-starting-construction-projects/article30613176.ece

233,2020/01/21,T.N. opposes amendment exempting hydrocarbon project from consultations,"Strongly opposing the recent amendment to the Environment Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, exempting the hydrocarbon project proposed in the Cauvery delta region from public consultations, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday urging maintenance of status quo ante and asking for the decision to be revoked.

In his letter to Mr. Modi, Mr. Palaniswami referred to the notification issued by the Union Ministry for Environment, Forest and Climate Change on January 16, which had amended the earlier notification of 2006 mandating prior environmental clearance for certain projects, of which offshore and onshore oil and gas exploration, development and production projects were categorised under ‘Category A’.

Recalling his earlier communication with Mr. Modi over opposition in Tamil Nadu to the hydrocarbon project, Mr. Palaniswami said projects involving exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons have always faced strong resistance from farmers/activists and other stakeholders in Tamil Nadu. “Since most of these projects are situated in the Cauvery delta districts, which is ecologically a fragile zone, but a very fertile region and the rice bowl of the State, the opposition to these projects has been emotive and intense,” he wrote.

‘Not consulted’

As it was quite “essential to take the people and all stakeholders along while implementing these projects, so that their cooperation and involvement is ensured”, the CM contended that the present notification went against this spirit. He also pointed out that no draft notification had been circulated as mandated and hence no opportunity was given to stakeholders and to the State government to offer views before the notification was issued.

Considering these facts, Mr. Palaniswami requested that status quo ante be maintained for the Cauvery delta region.

On January 16, the Centre issued an amendment to the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Notification, 2006, for exploration drilling in respect of on-shore and off-shore oil and gas, vide notification stating that “All projects in respect of off-shore and on-shore oil and gas development and production except exploration are categorised under category A"" and “All project in respect of off-shore and on-shore oil and gas exploration are categorized as ‘B2’ projects”.

Sources said that these 40 IP addresses were in addition to another set of about 40 IP addresses received in December.

238,2020/01/21,Farmers slam Centre for waiving EIA for hydrocarbon projects,"Farmers’ organisations in the Cauvery delta region have criticised the Centre’s decision to exempt oil and gas firms looking to carry out exploratory drilling from having to obtain environmental clearance. One such association has said it will move the Supreme Court against the Centre’s decision.

Farmers’ representatives contended that the move would destroy agriculture in the Cauvery delta and endanger the food security of the country. “The change will definitely upset the entire farming community of the country, especially farmers in the delta region on the east, which is rich in hydrocarbons. It will destroy agriculture once and for all,” observed Mannargudi S. Ranganathan, secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers’ Welfare Association.

“Drilling for oil and gas from sedimentary rock is one thing. But extracting hydrocarbon, which includes everything from coal bed methane to shale gas, will destroy the delta within the next 30 years,” he said. “The Prime Minister should be requested not to be obsessed with reducing the country’s oil import bill. It is a question of ensuring food security for future generations,” he added.

Mr. Ranganathan also urged the State government to leverage the good relations it enjoyed with the Centre to see to it that the hydrocarbon project is not implemented.

Declaring the Centre’s move “unconstitutional and oppressive”, P.R. Pandian, general secretary, Tamizhaga Cauvery Vivasayigal Sangam, said his association will move the Supreme Court, seeking the quashing of the Centre’s order and a ban on implementing hydrocarbon projects in the Cauvery delta.

‘Against federal spirit’

Mr. Pandian said the Centre’s order was against the federal spirit of the country and an attempt to stifle the voices of the people, since as per the order, public hearings need not be held as the need for obtaining an environmental impact assessment (EIA) had been done away with for both onshore and offshore drilling explorations. “Such orders make us wonder whether an undeclared Emergency is in force in the country,” Mr. Pandian said.

Pointing out that the Centre’s decision to grant permission to ONGC and the Vedanta group in 2019 to conduct exploratory oil surveys in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry had led to mass protests, Mr. Pandian affirmed that delta farmers will not give even an inch of land for such projects, and will even be prepared to sacrifice their lives for the cause.

Arupathi Kalyanam, general secretary, Federation of Farmers' Associations of Delta Districts, felt that the Centre’s move would have disastrous consequences for the delta. “The Centre should consider the plight of farmers and farm labourers and withdraw the decision,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/v10wps/article30610266.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21WELL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/farmers-slam-centre-for-waiving-eia-for-hydrocarbon-projects/article30610267.ece

Near and dear ones from the small towns are also sending requests and news of money distribution with a warning that they may lose out if the voters don’t come. For those residing in the city and reluctant to go to their native towns to cast their votes in the municipal polls these are the few inducements.

“I have been getting calls from all the contestants of our ward in our town since the last two days. They are literally begging and promising to arrange transport and also some cash,” said an Octogenarian in Uppal. The pressure from relatives and friends is increasing though he is unwilling to go due to his poor health.

High price

With each vote becoming precious due to the small size of voters in each ward the contestants seem to be going to any length to attract voters. “Ruling party candidates are offering not less than ₹ 3,000 while others are a bit behind,” agreed a voter in Peerzadiguda Municipality.

A family of four will end up earning at least ₹ 20,000 in these elections, agree leaders of political parties wishing anonymity. A candidate in a municipality in Narayanpet district is said to be gifting gold rings while sarees, household articles have become common.

New high

Such is the money flow in these elections this time, a three-time MLA is agonised to see such huge spending. “I have been in politics for 25 years but never saw such influence of money in local body elections,” he said.

He is astonished to see that people are not asking for roads, better infrastructure or raising issues like drinking water, but are openly demanding money. “We have 10 votes in our family. How much are you willing to spend has become a norm,” he said. “Shocking was that a guy who bought a new flat worth ₹ 50 lakh a few weeks ago also complained that he did not get his share of liquor so far!”",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/b49oo0/article30621806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY22NALGONDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/calls-cash-cars-are-the-inducements-as-state-gets-ready-for-municipal-polls/article30618474.ece
243,2020/01/21,Redo recruitment of JPS under sports quota: HC,"The Telangana High Court on Tuesday directed the State government to cancel selection of 98 candidates for the posts of Junior Panchayat Secretaries under sports quota.

Delivering the judgement, Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao instructed the government to notify the posts again for filling up under sports quota along with the remaining unfilled posts as per the notification issued on August 31, 2018.

As per the order, the government should invite applications from eligible candidates and apply the rule of minimum passing marks of 35% (who got 70 marks out of the 200 marks in the written test conducted for selection of the post).

The appointments should be made strictly on the basis of the merit of the candidates in the sports concerned as per the GO Ms. No. 74 dated August 9, 2012 and “not on the basis of the marks obtained by the candidates in the qualifying examination,” the judgement said. The judge ordered that the entire process of selection must be completed within three months of receiving the order copy.

A batch of writ petitions were filed alleging that the Panchayat Raj Department filled up 98 out of the 172 posts of Junior Panchayat Secretary under sports quota based on the marks secured in a qualifying examination. The petitioners contended that since posts under sports quota are given to encourage persons excelling in sports, the action of the government filling up posts under sports quota based on the marks in qualifying exams was arbitrary and illegal.

A contempt of court petition too was filed against the Panchayat Raj Commissioner as the recruitment was made in violation of the affidavit presented to the court. The judge said the contempt proceedings were being dropped as the Panchayat Raj Commissioner agreed to rectify the mistake by redoing the recruitment for the posts under sports quota.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/redo-recruitment-of-jps-under-sports-quota-hc/article30618445.ece
244,2020/01/21,The curse of Nagoba teak trees,"A couple of days ago, Adilabad Collector D. Divya categorically rejected an oral proposal by an Adivasi to cut down the clump of old teak trees near the Nagoba temple of Keslapur village in Indervelli mandal where the famous jatara is to start on January 24.

In doing so, she may have prevented bad luck befalling the person who proposed to cut the trees, going by the belief of Mesram clan Raj Gond tribals.

The sight of the fully mature, commercially valuable teak trees makes some people suggest that the wood be sold to fund the development around the temple. In the latest instance, the person who proposed felling of trees did so on the ground that the trees were old, making them weak enough to fall on their own.

“All those who had gained approval of authorities to cut the trees and transport them had ill luck striking them in different forms, especially health-wise. Some of them even died soon after obtaining permission,” claims Keslapur patel or village head man Mesram Venkat Rao as he narrates the myth surrounding the teak trees which is something akin to the curse of the Pharaohs.

According to Parubai, the septuagenarian mother of the patel, there were at least 1,000 trees around the temple, most of them teak, until the 1970s. In 2014, a census of the trees conducted by the Forest Department revealed that only 203 teak remained as hundreds were either cut by smugglers or fell on getting aged.

“The first one to seek official permission to fell the clump was a contractor from Warangal who died in an accident just a day before he could start chopping the trees and his son lost his limbs. There was another contractor from Mancherial who also died before he could wield the axe,” recalls Mesram Anand Rao, a former chairman of the Nagoba temple committee.

“When I had accompanied a contractor who had gone to the authorities to seek permission for felling the ageing trees, the serpent god appeared in my dream. I immediately went to the temple and performed puja to appease Nagoba,” he shares about the year-old incident.

Whenever a weak tree falls on its own, its puja is performed in the temple, says Mr. Venkat Rao.

“We believe that it is by order of the revered Nagoba that the tree has fallen,” he adds.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/m6jicq/article30618425.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21-KESLAPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/the-curse-of-nagoba-teak-trees/article30618417.ece

Although Telangana has been meeting the 60% seed needs of the country of major crops such as paddy, maize, pearl millet, sorghum, cotton and others, it did not focus on onion seed so far. According to officials, only Maharashtra has been producing onion seed in public sector and Telangana would be the second State to do so.

Before that, training on skills to produce quality onion seed would be given to 25 selected farmers in three phases in March, April and May next. A memorandum of understanding would also be signed between TSSDC and NHRDF on onion seed production in February.

The commission made elaborate arrangements to ensure that there was no inconvenience to voters and there was little scope for long queue lines in front of polling stations as the voter strength per polling station would be around 800. “With polling to be held from 7 am to 5 pm, there will be adequate time for electors to cast their votes,” he said.

Appealing to voters to cast their votes for selecting the right candidates who would serve them for the next five years, he wanted them to utilise the tender vote facility to check instances of impersonation. “Tender vote can lead to repolling and ensure that genuine voters exercise their franchise. The commission has adopted zero tolerance towards impersonation,” Mr Reddy said.

Asked about reports on use of money power, he said the commission had already positioned 285 flying squads and 360 stationary teams to check it. One candidate in Peddapalli municipality was caught red-handed while distributing money and a charge-sheet was being filed against him. Similar cases that came to the notice of the commission at Gadwal and Alampur were under investigation and necessary action would be initiated against those found guilty.

“While the commission has made its arrangements, it is for the citizens and political parties to be alert and bring instances of luring voters to our notice. They can utilise the smart gadgets including cell phones to get evidence and candidates can be disqualified even if they win in the polls,” he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/stage-set-for-telangana-ulb-polls-today/article30617078.ece

BJP Bandi Sanjay Kumar had also launched his electioneering in various divisions and appealed to the voters to elect BJP candidates for the transparent and corruption-free administration. Flaying the TRS leaders charges that the Asara pensions would be stopped if the opposition parties are elected in municipal polls, he clarified that the BJP, if elected to power in MCK, would add additional pension to the existing Asara pension amount. Former MP and BJP leader G Vivek Venkaswamy along with district president Basa Satyanarayana separately campaigned for the BJP candidates.

MLC T Jeevan Reddy along with TPCC working president Ponnam Prabhakar launched the electioneering for the support of Congress candidates in the town. On this occasion, Mr Jeevan Reddy alleged that Minister for Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar, who was a legislator from Karimnagar segment since 2009, had failed to take up any developmental works, but had amassed huge wealth.

TPCC working president Ponnam Prabhakar flayed the Minister for promising 24x7 drinking water supply again in Karimnagar town when he had failed to fulfil the promise made in 2009 as legislator.

255,2020/01/21,Campaigning comes to an end in 129 ULBs across Telangana,"The high-decibel campaigning for elections to 129 urban local bodies (ULBs) with the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leaders having high stakes particularly after party president and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s indication of taking the results to measure their “performance” came to an end on Monday evening.

However, the parties’ efforts to influence and attract the electorate are still on in their own ways till the polling the is completed.

As the elections are being held across the State, the responsibility of campaigning was primarily shouldered by the ministers, MLAs, MLCs and MPs for the ruling party, while it was the local leaders who took the responsibility for the Opposition parties Congress, BJP and others. Working president of TRS K.T. Rama Rao supervised the campaigning personally till the penultimate day before leaving for Davos.

For Congress, Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, working president A. Revanth Reddy and Legislature Party Leader M. Bhatti Vikramarka led the campaigning while other bigwigs limited themselves to their respective strongholds.

Creating a buzz

State unit president K. Laxman led the BJP’s electioneering although several leaders from the Centre and other States too chipped in. The friendly party of ruling TRS, AIMIM, which has high stakes in about a dozen ULBs, too has succeeded in creating a buzz in its distinct way.

The BJP tried to rake up the issue of TRS friendship with MIM. Some BJP leaders went to the extent of charging that TRS had already conceded mayoral post to the MIM in at least two corporations in North Telangana.

Rebel issue

The ruling TRS has the highest problem of rebels although the party leadership has gone all out to make them withdraw from the contest. However, the opposition parties have tried to utilise the opportunity to their advantage either by supporting the ruling party rebels wherever they have no or weak candidates or by ‘adopting’ them as their candidates.

In spite of the ministers and other elected representatives immersed in electioneering for the last 10 days, TRS working president, who is away at Davos attending the World Economic Forum summit, has asked the party ranks to be agile for the next 36 hours to ensure the voters supported the party amply.

Both the Congress and BJP are hopeful that they would make inroads into TRS strongholds banking on the anti-incumbency factor and also the support they secured in Lok Sabha elections in 2019 after receiving a drubbing in the Assembly elections held a few months before.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pkwsdx/article30612862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21NLG-CAMPAIGN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/campaigning-ends-for-129-ulbs-in-telangana-state/article30612863.ece

258,2020/01/21,Reciting Preamble a must in Maharashtra schools,"Maharashtra government has made it compulsory to recite the Preamble to the Constitution in all schools starting January 26.

A government resolution issued on Tuesday said the objective is to instil values such as justice, freedom and equality enshrined in the Constitution. A similar resolution had been issued in 2013 by the then Congress-NCP government.

Tuesday’s resolution also directs the schools to put up a plaque or board with the Preamble and asked schools to hold quizzes, essay, drawing, slogan, poster competitions based on the Constitution. In 2016, the directorate of secondary education had also issued the same directive, asking all schools to recite the Constitution.

According to another resolution issued on Tuesday, “To understand the scope of constitutional values and their all-inclusiveness and instil values such as justice, freedom, equality and fraternity on the society, it is important that students have a comprehensive introduction to the Constitution…The young minds of this age will thus become responsible, cultured citizens. It is expected that this starts during school-going age and that is why every day, during the morning routine, there should be collective reading of the Preamble and a government resolution is already in place for it from 2013. It has now been noticed that the decision is not being implemented. Therefore, under an initiative titled “Sarvabhaumatva Samvidhanache, Janhit Sarvanche” (Sovereignty of the Constitution, Welfare of All), all primary and secondary schools must undertake collective reciting of the preamble every day. The initiative be started from January 26.”

The Education Commissioner will review this periodically. Prashant Redij, secretary, Mumbai Principals’ Association said, “We welcome the move. Despite the old government order, there was only about 25% implementation in schools. We hope the new Education Minister, who is an educationist herself, will ensure better implementation as students are not well acquainted with the Constitution.”

The government will also be making Marathi language compulsory in all Maharashtra schools. A law to this effect will be brought in the next session of Assembly.

259,2020/01/21,High Court stays CAT order setting aside Punjab DGP’s appointment,"The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday granted a stay on the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which had set aside the appointment of Punjab’s Director General of Police (DGP), Dinkar Gupta, from the top post.

Senior advocate Puneet Bali, counsel for DGP Gupta, said the High Court had stayed the CAT order.

The High Court also issued notice to the Punjab Government, the Central Government and other respondents.

The next date for the hearing has been fixed as February 26.

In its directions, the High Court also ordered the Punjab Government to file an affidavit on material that was sent to the Union Public Service Commission with regard to all the officers considered.

260,2020/01/21,IIM Indore to train MP police on tackling misinformation without Internet suspension,"With India topping the world in Internet shutdowns — a common knee-jerk reaction to the fear of unrest that hobbles daily life and cripples businesses — the Indian Institute of Management, Indore, will advise the Madhya Pradesh police on ways to tackle the online flow of misinformation without suspending data services.

The business school is set to organise workshops for the police in the State, where, according to the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC), six reported shutdowns were effected by State and local authorities in the past three years. Overall, Indian Internet users faced 381 Web suspensions from 2012 till date, with the highest number being in 2018, at 134 .

“The usual protocol to counter the spread of misinformation is to suspend the Internet,” said IIM (I) Director Himanshu Rai. “Well, that’s not the solution, as its suspension doesn’t really curtail the spread.”

Stressing the use of data analytics, artificial intelligence and information management systems, the IIM will help the police leverage new technologies to analyse videos online to stymie the spread of fake news, and enable “adequate” and “intelligent” use of the Internet — with the Internet still accessible to the public.

Shutdowns were found to be much more strongly associated with increases in violent collective action than with non-violent mobilisations, according to a study by Jan Rydzak, associate director for programme, Stanford Global Digital Policy Incubator. “Information blackouts compel participants in collective action in India to substitute non-violent tactics” with violent ones that are less reliant on effective communication and coordination, Mr. Rydzak wrote in the study.

In addition, the IIM would train officials on negotiating with crowds and employing effective communication tools. It would also review the beat system, which takes personnel to the community for better coordination in curbing crimes, and make recommendations on how it could be strengthened, said Mr. Rai.

Further, in a bid to relieve personnel of stress, the institute would identify stressors through an experimental study, and suggest changes to work patterns. “Stress can be due to the nature of work, job rotation, long work hours and unavailability of leaves,” he added.

The suicide rate within the police force was increasing in the country, asserted Mr. Rai, who claimed the biggest challenge faced by the force’s personnel was having to be on duty while others met their families and celebrated, say on occasions such as festivals. Also, most States don’t offer ‘weekly offs’ to personnel, he added, making it almost impossible for constables to visit their families in another village or city.

In February, then Union Minister of State for Home Hansraj Ahir had informed the Rajya Sabha that more than 930 police personnel, including paramilitaries, had committed suicide in the five years before 2019.

A 2015 study by the Board of Police Research and Development found that suicidal tendencies were more aggravated among officials of lower ranks.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/iim-indore-to-train-mp-police-on-tackling-misinformation-without-internet-suspension/article30615845.ece
261,2020/01/21,Dabholkar killing: Sanatan Sanstha member Vikram Bhave’s bail plea rejected,"A special court on Tuesday rejected the bail application of Sanatan Sanstha member Vikram Bhave, who was arrested by the CBI in connection with the 2013 murder of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar.

Additional Sessions Judge S. R. Navandar said Bhave could not be granted bail given his conviction in the 2008 Thane bomb blasts case and in view of his alleged role in Dabholkar’s murder.

The defence and prosecution lawyers concluded their arguments on Bhave bail plea on January 2.

Bhave, along with another Sanatan Sanstha member Ramesh Gadkari, had been convicted for his alleged involvement in the blasts in two theatres and a cinema hall in Thane, Vashi and Panvel respectively in 2008. A Mumbai court subsequently sentenced the duo to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment in August 2011 under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Explosives Substances Act.

However, the Bombay High Court granted them bail in the case in 2013.

Bhave was arrested along with right-wing lawyer Sanjeev Punalekar, counsel for the fringe Sanathan Sanstha, by the CBI on May 25 last year after the agency alleged that they had participated in the conspiracy to murder Dabholkar.

While advocate Punalekar was granted bail in July last, Bhave is presently in judicial custody in the Yerawada central jail in connection with the Dabholkar murder case.

Punalekar was charged with destruction of evidence and in advising Sharad Kalaskar - named by the probe agencies as Dabholkar’s killers – to allegedly destroy the murder weapon.

In a statement to the CBI in 2018, Kalaskar allegedly said that Punalekar, known for his statements against Dabholkar, had asked him to destroy the weapons.

According to the CBI, Kalaskar further revealed that it was Bhave who planned the reconnaissance and had even pointed Dabholkar to the assailants. It claimed that Bhave had also planned the getaway route for the shooters after the crime.

In November last, the CBI filed a supplementary charge sheet against Punalekar and Bhave in connection with the Dabholkar murder. He was shot dead while out for his morning stroll on Pune’s Omkareshwar Bridge on August 20, 2013.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jz6qwv/article30615642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIKRAMBHAVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dabholkar-killing-sanatan-sanstha-member-vikram-bhaves-bail-plea-rejected/article30615643.ece
262,2020/01/21,"Heroin worth ₹100 cr. seized in Kolkata, 2 arrested","In one of the biggest seizures of narcotics in eastern India in recent times, the Kolkata police on Tuesday seized a big quantity of heroin, whose market value may be about ₹100 crore.

Acting on a tip-off, the Special Task Force of the police made the seizure from Paikpara under the Tala police station in the early hours of Tuesday.

“We have seized about 25.255 kg of heroin. Two persons have been arrested and we will produce them before a court and seek police custody,” Deputy Commissioner, Special Task Force, Pradeep Kumar Yadav, told The Hindu.

The two have been identified as Zuber from Bahraich in Uttar Pradesh and Faizuddin from Thoubal in Manipur.

“It appears that they are couriers. What we have gathered is that they were carrying two different qualities of substance. They had brought he two drugs for mixing and exchange,” Mr. Yadav said.

The police suspect they are negotiating about Yaba tablets, another narcotic drug, but no tablets were recovered from the two accused.

Yaba, a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine, is sold as cheap red or pink pills. It enters West Bengal mainly through the porous border with Bangladesh.

Investigation was on to ascertain where the drug was sourced from and the financial mechanism behind the illegal trade, Mr. Yadav said.

263,2020/01/21,CAA protests make Lucknow’s Hussainabad clock tower ‘chime’ again,"Since Friday afternoon last, a few hundred women and children have been gathering at the foot of the Hussainabad Clock Tower in old Lucknow to raise their voice against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The gatherings have thrown the spotlight on one of Lucknow's most recognizable landmarks, which happens to be the tallest clock tower in the country at 221 feet height, and has become an unusual site for mass protest in the heart of the Uttar Pradesh capital's tourist circuit.

While it's been many years since the clock went silent, its vicinity has for the past few days been buzzing with slogans and songs against the amended citizenship law.

Locally known as the Hussainabad Ghanta Ghar, the clock tower was built in 1881 by Nawab Nasir-ud-Din Haider to mark the arrival of the first lieutenant Governor of the United Province of Awadh, Sir George Couper, as per official State government websites. It was built at a cost of ₹ 1.75 lakh, says the Lucknow district administration website.

Made of brick, lime and iron, it has a gigantic clock fitted at the top. Historians say it was built as a replica of the Big Ben in London.

Not protected by ASI

However, the clock tower is not protected by either the Archeological Survey of India (ASI) or the State Archaeology department, to the dismay of many heritage lovers. It is under the control and ownership of the Hussainabad Allied Trust (HAT), which is chaired by the district magistrate.

The Tourism Department highlights its Victorian and Gothic style designs. “Gunmetal is used for building the clock parts. Its gigantic pendulum has a length of 14 feet and the dial of the clock is designed in the shape of a 12-petalled flower and bells around it,” it said.

The clock tower measures 20 feet at the base and rises like a tree trunk displaying clocks of a unique design in the fourth layer facing all four directions. It was designed by R. R. Bayne of Calcutta and made by J. W. Ludgate of London, says the HAT.

Over the years, several heritage lovers and conservationists have demanded the inclusion of the monument among centrally protected sites.

Lawyer Mohammad Haider Rizvi wrote to the ASI in 2014 seeking its inclusion in the list of the centrally protected monuments but his representation, in which he argued that it was a historical edifice and monument of national importance, was not even acknowledged. He then filed an RTI.

The ASI in its reply in August 2016, however, stated that there was “no immediate need” for Central protection for the clock tower.

“Being only 100 years old does not qualify for any structure to be declared a Centrally Protected Monument but it is the historical or art historical value in the history of the nation and security-safety constraints which is to be considered for the protection of any structure,” the ASI said.

It also said that the HAT had not not signed any agreement with it as was required under section six of Ancient Monuments, Site and Remains Act, 1958.

Various illegal interventions have been made by the trust and district administration in the centrally protected monuments, the ASI pointed out. “It is not suggested to take the clock tower under Central protection without total control of the whole archaeological area and rehabilitation programme of the families already residing in the vicinity,” it said.

ASI response ‘insufficient’

Unhappy with the ASI response, Mr. Rizvi says the reply was “hurriedly given” and insufficient. “This is unfortunate. It should have got protection status. If graves [of British era] can be protected, why not the clock tower,” he asks. Till date, the ASI has not protected any new monument in Lucknow, only deprotected some, he adds.

Mr. Rizvi asserts that he will continue to pitch for the protection of the clock tower, if not with the ASI but with the State Archaeology Department.

A senior ASI official said they had not received any formal request from the HAT for including the clock tower into the list of Centrally protected monuments. “They have not sent us a request asking for ASI protection. There is no proposal before us,” the official says, requesting anonymity.

The Clock tower, though almost 140 years old, was not that significant for the ASI, the official says, pointing out that the Bada Imambada, located in the vicinity, was built in 1784. “Most of our monuments were protected in the 1920s itself by the British. The clock tower, being a recent construction back then, was not protected,” he observes.

Became functional in 2011

Over the past few years, the HAT and the district administration made several attempts to get the clock chime again. After many failed steps, they succeeded to make it functional in 2011 but it went silent again soon after.

“They tried well and even started it but it stopped functioning again. The maintenance of this tower is not regular and not in the favour of conservation,” says Roshan Taqui, historian with expertise in conservation of old buildings and monuments, 'problems and possible solutions.'

Mr. Taqui states that the initial idea of the clock tower planners was to erect it as high as the Big Ben, which stands at 315 feet in height. But safety concerns weighed in. “The soil of rhe Gomti river nearby was alluvial. It was not so good for strength and bearing capacity. They feared accidents may take place if the tower was built with that height,” he notes.

The British built clock towers in many places in the country to remind Indians of the “importance of time.” He, however, laments that the area around the Lucknow clock tower has “lost its nobility and old charm, “due to illegal constructions and lack of hygienic management over the years”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/v4cbfd/article30614422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21HUSSAINABAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-protests-make-lucknows-hussainabad-clock-tower-chime-again/article30614423.ece
264,2020/01/21,Sai Baba birthplace row uncalled for; Uddhav can’t be blamed: Shiv Sena,"The Shiv Sena on Tuesday said Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should not be blamed for the “uncalled for” controversy over the birthplace of Saibaba as nobody can tell whether the 19th century saint was actually born in Shirdi.

Noting that the Saibaba Sansthan’s assets are worth over ₹2,600 crore out of which social works are done, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said Shirdi became “rich” because of the saint, and none can snatch away the richness of the town where he died.

It also said that Mr. Thackeray did not refer to Pathri in Parbhani district as Saibaba’s birthplace “on his own”, but on the basis of versions of some historians.

During a State Cabinet meeting on January 9, Mr. Thackeray said Pathri, considered the birthplace of Saibaba, would be developed as a site of religious tourism, and announced a grant of Rs 100 crore for the place.

The led to a row following which locals from Shirdi called for a bandh in the temple town on Sunday.

The bandh was, however, called off on Sunday midnight and Mr. Thackeray met some residents of Shirdi on Monday and the issue was resolved.

“The chief minister did not stoke any controversy. Pathri and Shirdikars, too, should not create it. This will lessen the glow of saints,” the Shiv Sena said in ‘Saamana’

The “uncalled for” controversy was put to rest after the Chief Minister promptly paid attention to the matter and cleared the government’s stance on the issue, it said.

The Sena said Mr. Thackeray did not refer to Pathri during the January 9 meeting “on his own”, but on the grounds of versions of some historians.

Saibaba “appeared” at Shirdi in Ahmednagar district, but none can tell whether he actually was born there. When Saibaba first showed up in Shirdi, nobody knew what his name was and from where had come, the Marathi daily said.

“From where Baba came to Shirdi, whether he came from Pathri, there is a mention about this in Parbhani’s government gazette that ‘according to some, it (Pathri) could be the birthplace of Shirdi’s saint Saibaba’,” it said.

“The chief minister has not written or published the gazette. Hence, he should not be blamed for the controversy,” the Shiv Sena added.

The party further said Shirdi became “rich” because of Saibaba and none can snatch away the richness from the town where the saint breathed his last.

The Saibaba Sansthan’s assets are worth ₹2,693 crore and the temple daily gets donations in lakhs out of which social works are carried out, it noted.

“Why then the controversy over the birthplace of the fakir (an ascetic) who was a born fakir and appeared in Shirdi as a fakir? It is not going to lessen the importance of Shirdi,” the ruling party said.

The importance of Pune’s Shivneri fort, where Chhatrapati Shivaji was born, did not lessen after the Maratha warrior king died at Raigad Fort, which has now become a “tirth kshetra” (holy place), it added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/44sgmf/article30595992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHIRDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sai-baba-birthplace-row-uncalled-for-uddhav-cant-be-blamed-shiv-sena/article30613220.ece
265,2020/01/21,SC hearing on CAA: Shutdown declared across northeast colleges tomorrow,"Students’ associations in the northeast have declared a total shutdown across universities and colleges in the region on Wednesday when the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear petitions challenging the validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA).

The CAA has been designed to fast-track the process of granting citizenship to six non-Muslim communities — Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian — who allegedly fled religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan till December 31, 2014, and took refuge in India.

269,2020/01/21,"From barefoot to borrowed, Ethiopian marathoners run to fame","Derara Hurisa’s powerful surge to the finish on borrowed shoes at the Tata Mumbai Marathon 2020 pointed to the distance Ethiopian long-distance running has travelled from the days of barefoot Olympic champion Abebe Bikila.

The former made news for setting a course record 2:08:09 wearing a branded shoe, a product marketed as the running tool for faster performance. The latter covered the cobbled Rome roads on bare feet hardened by military training and was timed at 2:15:16, which became the Olympic record in 1960 (bettering Emil Zatopek’s mark).

Handed a Nike Vaporfly shoe by fellow Ethiopian Abraham Girma as timely replacement for Hurisa’s regular shoe misplaced in travel from Addis Ababa to Mumbai, the cross country runner revealed he wore the borrowed brand first time in competition.

It was also his debut run on the seafront route, emerging a clear winner among 70 elite men marathoners listed (improving on Gideon Kipkieter’s 2016 record). Incidentally, shoe lender Girma is not listed among the first 20 finishers in Mumbai.

Bikila, a soldier in the imperial guard, responsible for security to the Ethiopian ruler, Emperor Haile Selassie, decided to run in Rome without shoes, as recorded in history, after his regular pair got worn out and the new pair felt uncomfortable.

Familiar with barefoot running as part of army regimen, he arrived from Addis Ababa determined to etch the nation’s name in Olympic history. Wearing vest No. 11, he loped to victory on a route lit by flaming torches. The marathon was held in the evening to help runners escape the heat.

Hurisa’s winning time on Sunday’s run is inside the 2020 Tokyo Olympics qualification time for men (2:11:30), but the Ethiopian marathon running depth is such that the champion, on debut in Mumbai, may have to be satisfied competing for prize money in near future, eyeing contracts from athletics equipment giants, besides appearance fee from event promoters.

He was an unknown face, the only notable international representation was a second place four years ago at the African U-20 Cross Country event.

Bikila returned to the Olympic stage four years later in Tokyo 1964, became a hero after winning the second consecutive marathon gold, this time running in shoes and was gifted a car by the Emperor.

The business of road running, as Tokyo 2020 approaches this year, demands more commitment from sensations like Hurisa than just winning.

Richer by $60,000, the 23-year-old champion appeared for post-race media interviews in Mumbai clad in Adidas, live race footage showed him pounding the road clad in Nike special shoes.

Support from manufacturers is linked to brand endorsement. When quizzed by the media about the brand switch on the road and later, Hurisa replied that Adidas supported him with shoes and no contract was signed. Circumstances forced him to wear a borrowed shoe designed by a rival manufacturer.

The course record time on debut over the marathon distance is a startling feat, fuelled by impatience of youth displayed in the imperious finish leaving behind fellow Ethiopian Ayele Abshero in second place.

Did the shoe make a difference over a distance made famous across Africa by barefoot marathon legend Bikila? Only time will tell.",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/qvzkkb/article30618025.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH212HURISA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/from-barefoot-to-borrowed-ethiopian-marathoners-run-to-fame/article30616527.ece

As part of eliminating unmanned and manned level crossings in Salem Railway Division, the Construction Organisation of the Southern Railway began works to construct an limited use subway at ₹ 1.5 crore in the Chennai – Erode section at Vendipalayam in October 2019.

The road was temporarily closed to facilitate the work, and the area residents had to take additional five km to reach the other side to even board buses.

Conflict in the bordering districts of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore had claimed the lives of human beings as well as elephants in the last years. Though estimated elephant count in south Bengal is less than 200, invading elephants from Jharkhand and Orissa have created complex conflict scenario in the last few decades. The Purulia Forest Division sought the help of the institute’s faculty who had successfully installed the system in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve.

The Forest Department along with Simultala Conservationists, a wildlife conservation organisation, and Bannari Amman Institute of Technology installed six early elephant detection and warning system under a pilot project to track down the elephant movement in Jhalda Range of Ajodhya Hill and Forest Reserve.

The flyover work, which was started in 2014 to replace a manned level crossing on Leigh Bazaar VCC Road faced legal hurdles. The level crossing caused regular traffic congestion in the busy Shevapet area, as most of the goods trucks operated in the route.

Motorists heading towards Shevapet and Nethimedu have to take this road to reach Leigh Bazaar and Three Roads junction.

273,2020/01/21,T.N. leads in maintaining law and order :CM,"Chief Minister Edappadi.K. Palaniswami on Tuesday said Tamil Nadu led the nation in maintaining law and order and said that Leader of the Opposition and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president M.K. Stalin lacked administrative capabilities.

Addressing at 103rd birth anniversary celebrations of former Chief Minister and All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam founder M.G. Ramanchandran, he alleged that the DMK won Parliament elections on false promises to the people. He said the vote share of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam increased in the rural local body elections.

On the differences between the Congress and the DMK, Mr. Palaniswami said the DMK never respected its allies or upheld coalition ethics. Upholding ethics, the AIADMK gave the post of the Salem District Panchayat Chairman to the Pattali Makkal Katchi though it had won only a few seats.

Listing schemes and budget allocations made for education, healthcare and agriculture, the Chief Minister countered allegations made by Mr. Stalin that this government was dysfunctional. The State gained top position in good governance index and the government had won national-level awards for excellence. Mr. Palaniswami said he would lay the foundation for the international livestock park at Thalaivasal on February 7.

Mr. Palaniswami accused the DMK and Mr. Stalin of spreading false news among minority communities on the National Population Register. No member of any minority community in the State would be affected, he said.

The DMK was in power along with the Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre when the amendment to the Citizenship Act was introduced in 2003.

274,2020/01/21,Odisha govt. trains workers for industries in other States,"Industries looking for skilled labour from other States can look at Odisha as the State has more than 125 training centres, training workers in more than 50 trades. Most of the workers are now employed at garment units. “We want to look at other sectors,” said Badal Kumar Mohanty, Joint Chief Executive Officer of the Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society.

The Society conducted a conclave here on Tuesday jointly with the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore.

Mr. Mohanty told The Hindu that the training centres offer three to one year training programmes and 70 % of the workers get placement. There are tie-ups with more than 200 employers and several industrial associations. Some of the large industries have set up training facilities and train the workers and others recruit the trained workers.

“We want to ensure the workers get good jobs. So we scrutinise the employers for tie-ups,"" he said.

The officials visit the villages, hold household surveys, identify the needs of the families and explain to them about opportunities in different States. The workers are trained based on the options available. While a large number of workers are placed at garment factories, there are emerging sectors such as electrical and electronics, garment designing and engineering.

In the engineering sector, there is a need to meet the industry expectations. Hence, industries can explain the technology updates and their requirements, Mr. Mohanty added. “The aim is to train more than 50,000 workers a year,” he said. The cost of the training is borne by the Central and State governments.

Mr. Mohanty will visit some of the factories in the region on Wednesday.

According to V. Lakshminarayanasamy, president of the Chamber, the industries in Coimbatore need workers for CNC operation, winding and sheet metal press work.

275,2020/01/21,Prices of tomato drop following heavy arrival,"For farmers in and around Kinathukadavu cultivating tomatoes, this season had been one of low prices.

They started harvesting in September and they will go for a new crop shortly. Farm gate prices have been hovering around ₹150 for 15 kg. “Any price less than ₹200 for 15 kg is a loss,” says Krishnasamy, a tomato farmer from Kaliapuram, near Pollachi.

About 100 farmers raise tomatoes on an acre or so each. The area does not alter much. “We reduce or add half an acre on tomatoes based on the demand,” he says. But this season, which will end soon, prices have ranged between ₹120 to ₹150 for 15 kg. “We lost some crop because of heavy rain last year. Then the prices crashed,” he says.

According to R. Amirtharaj, another farmer, tomatoes are 90 days crop and the production cost works out to nearly ₹1 lakh for an acre. The farmers take the tomatoes to the nearest markets, including Kinathukadavu, and the prices are very low since September.

The farmers say that according to the traders, who buy from them, the arrivals are high this season and so prices have fallen.

Velusamy, one of the major wholesale traders at Kinathukadavu, said arrivals are high this season. Earlier, traders from different parts of Tamil Nadu and even other States used to come here to buy tomatoes. Now, markets such as Tiruchi, Madurai or Theni are supplied from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. With cultivation of hybrid varieties, tomatoes arrive all through the year and from different areas. Hence, there is over supply, he said.

M. Rajendran, president of the Thyagi Kumaran Wholesale Vegetable Traders’ Association in Coimbatore, says the supply is high this season. On Tuesday, Coimbatore received high supply from Maharashtra and Karnataka. It is higher than usual and may come down in two weeks. Prices might go up after that. In Coimbatore, the wholesale price of tomatoes on Tuesday was ₹ 10 - ₹12 a kg.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/prices-of-tomato-drop-following-heavy-arrival/article30618840.ece
276,2020/01/21,Bungled midnight bid to burgle SBI Anchetty branch in Krishnagiri district,"Burglars struck at the Anchetty branch of the State Bank of India with a cylinder and gas-cutters, but the heist bid was bungled by a freak fire while they were cutting the grill of the window to the bank, a preliminary crime scene investigation has revealed. The fire forced the burglars to forego their plan midway through the attempted robbery and leave.

The incident came to light after a vigilant neighbour noticed lights on inside the bank at night.

The burglars had jumped into the back of the bank’s compound located on the main road overlooking the Anchetty bus stand. The burglars had made a bid to cut through the grill of the rear window. However, fire from the gas-cutter caught a calendar hanging near the window from the inside. The fire had spread, mildly inflaming some cables on the inside. The preliminary reconstruction of the crime scene was done by the police with the charred remains of the objects inside the bank near the rear window.

The burglars, pre-empting a smoke alarm, dropped their heist attempt and fled the spot. In the melee, the light was switched on, which alerted a neighbour in due course.

Anchetty police on being alerted, arrived at the spot and gathered evidence. Gas-cutters and welding tools and charred sheets were found inside the safe room. A cyclinder with a lengthy 20-ft. hose was also found abandoned, tucked away behind the shrubs behind the compound wall of the bank.

The bank services predominantly poor, daily wage labourers, who hold accounts to their MNREGS and other savings bank accounts.

There were no CCTVs around the periphery of the Bank, and no guard was appointed at the branch.

In 2015, a midnight heist at a Bank of Baroda branch of Gurubarapalli in Krishnagiri saw burglars taking off with over 6,400 sovereigns of gold jewellery pledged against loans by the predominantly rural, farming account holders. The case remained to be cracked.

The heist forced the spotlight on the absence of even cursory safeguards for banks and ATMs, followed by marathon meetings with bankers by the administration to ring in a system of safeguards. It was found that most of the banks had no guards for the branches as well as the ATMs as a cost-cutting measure.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/dce6p3/article30614825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21JANTH--Bankjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bungled-midnight-bid-to-burgle-sbi-anchetty-branch-in-krishnagiri-district/article30614826.ece
277,2020/01/21,"Compression garments, a potential product for Tiruppur garment manufacturers","Garment manufacturers in Tiruppur who make socks, may start looking at making compression garments, which are sports and medical textile products. The AIC-NIFT TEA Incubation Centre for Textiles and Apparels, set up with support from the Union Government to promote innovation, is ready to support entrepreneurs in making compression garments and socks, using sustainable materials.

S. Periasamy, chief executive officer for the Centre, said a plant to produce compression socks can be set up with an investment of ₹1.5 crore. The market is huge, as compression socks are used by patients who have undergone surgeries and those suffering from varicose veins. Sport compressive garments are much in demand too. “We want to create awareness about this product and introduce it in the Tiruppur cluster. If an entrepreneur comes forward we can try to arrange for seed funds also,” he said.

On Tuesday, the Centre organised an awareness meeting regarding compression garments.

The Incubation Centre has 24 incubatees, and one of them is working on banana fibres. The fibre from banana plant waste can be blended with cotton to make a sustainable fibre. The yarn from this can be used to make the compression garments without compromising on the properties of the product. The Centre will work on it, he said.

At present, a substantial volume of compression garments are imported into the country. The prices are high and the sizes cannot be customised according to Indian needs. If the products are made by domestic manufacturers, there is scope for customisation and it will boost demand. “We need to create awareness among the industries and support them to start making the products,” Mr. Periasamy said.

One of the aims of the AIC- NIFT TEA Incubation Centre is introducing new products in the Tiruppur cluster and creating larger market opportunities for the industry in Tiruppur.

280,2020/01/21,Farm ponds bring more water to coconut groves,"Many of the coconut farmers in and around Pollachi feel they may not face water problem in summer this year. Good monsoon rains last year coupled with farm ponds are helping them.

R. Raghunathan, a farmer from Udumalpet taluk, says his land received two good rains in the last couple of months and that has filled the farm pond on his land. It is helping him now and he is confident that he will not face water problems in summer.

R. Gopalasamy at Kollapatti says two borewells and two wells on his four acre farm are seeing higher water levels because of the farm pond that was dug two months ago. It is benefiting the farms for nearly one km around.

Marico takes up water conservation projects, through the Parachute Kalpavriksha Foundation, largely in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. It identifies farm lands, talks to farmers, and promotes different types of water conservation systems - farm ponds, bunds on small farm lands, desilting of dams, Bhungroo, Urdhvam and a combination of Urdhvam and Bhungroo (recharging borewells).

Raghunathan and Gopalsamy are among the nearly 500 farmers in Pollachi area who have one of these systems on their land, developed with the support of the Foundation.

R. Marimuthu, who has coconut trees on 10 acres at Kollapatti, says the farm pond on his land has benefitted nearby farmers too. “They visit my land to see the farm pond and are showing interest in having a similar system on their lands too,” he says.

According to Uday Raj Prabhu, who heads the Corporate Social Responsibility projects of Marico, over the last three years, the company has spent Rs. 4 crore on water conservation projects. It hasdeveloped nearly 500 farm ponds in different States and by end of March, 175 of these will be in Pollachi area.

“The farmers seem to prefer farm ponds. We will focus more on it,” he says. A farmer will lose 10 to 12 coconut trees to set up a farm pond. So, it can be developed only if the farmer has at least four acres, he adds.

“A farm land will get rains for 90 to 100 days a year and that too only for a few hours on a day. Water percolation will not be 100 % and a lot of water is lost in a few days. Digging farm ponds will help conserve water and improve the ground water level,” Mr. Prabhu says.

Marico bears 80 % of the cost in developing a farm pond. For the farmers, the company executives approach them and discuss the details, help in cost, and the quality of the work executed is good.

“It is alright to lose 10 to 12 trees for the benefit of 100 trees,” says Mr. Raghunath.

Farmers cannot bear the entire cost for such works. But water is a necessity and these efforts encourages other farmers to look at the options available, says R. Amirtharaj, who has a Bhungroo set up on his land by Marico.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/3yf8gw/article30610141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB21-POND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/farm-ponds-bring-more-water-to-coconut-groves/article30610142.ece

283,2020/01/21,Water supply project progressing at a slow pace in the city,"Sometime after Pongal holidays in 2019, the Coimbatore Corporation started work on a project to completely revamp the water supply distribution network in the old part of the city.

The Corporation had engaged Suez India Pvt. Ltd. to execute the ₹ 2,373.16 crore project to replace all the pipelines in the old city – 60 wards – in four years and maintain the water distribution infrastructure for 21 years thereafter.

As part of the contract with the company, the Corporation had also planned to completely automate water distribution, read water consumption details, and introduce advanced leak detection techniques.

But by Pongal 2020, the Corporation had not completed even the pilot project. The Corporation sources, familiar with the development, said the civic body was still in the process of laying distribution pipelines, providing house service connections and patching roads and installing water meters in the pilot area – Wards 23 and 24 in full and Wards 22, 25 and 79 in part (areas in and around R.S. Puram).

Aside from implementing the project in the pilot area, the Corporation had only attended to leaks and solved some long-pending water distribution issues in a few pockets in the city, thanks to the technology that Suez had brought in, the sources pointed out.

During the past year, the Corporation ought to have finalised the roadmap of how it would execute the project – the list of localities that it would take up one after another, the time frame for completing the work, and the cost for each of those localities.

The sources said though the company had submitted the roadmap, called capital investment plan, the Corporation had been sitting over it, without giving it approval of comments, one way or the other.

And, the Corporation had also released very little money to the company for the work it had executed over the past year.

In anticipation that the work would progress as scheduled and it would have the capital investment plan on hand during the execution of the project in the pilot area, the company had bought pipelines for a few crore rupees and they were lying idle.

The reason for the delay, the sources hinted, was political interference. Sometimes the Corporation would give the go-ahead to execute some part of the work under execution; at other times, it would slowdown or postpone the work.

This impulsive decision-making and execution in fits and starts had affected the work schedule and the Corporation should have a steady, clear and uniform approach so that it completed the work within the next three years, the sources added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/9t8ytk/article30610116.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB21-PIPET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/water-supply-project-progressing-at-a-slow-pace-in-the-city/article30610117.ece

The dogs killed the snake while they were accompanying their master Ramalingam of Poonga Nagar (Phase II) and his friend Kumar to the farm close to house. The dogs, two Labradors and a mongrel, are seen in the video, shot by Mr.Kumar, attacking the snake taking turns until it becomes immobile.

Mr. Ramalingam’s son Sivaprakash told The Hindu that the incident happened when his father and Mr. Kumar went to a grassland in the farm where their cattle were grazing on Sunday noon.

“The dogs -- Senan, Karuppan and Jimmy -- found the snake in a thick patch of grass after a round of sniffing. They attacked the snake in turns and killed it. The dogs, all aged three, have killed snakes in the farm in the past too,” he said.

288,2020/01/21,Farmers want periodic maintenance of Perumpallam anicut,"With the entire water spread of Perumpallam anicut at Surampatti being covered with aquatic weeds, farmers urged the district administration to remove the weeds and take effective steps to control it.

The anicut was constructed in 1966 with seepage from Lower Bhavani Project (LBP) canal being its main source of water.

Release of water from the anicut helped irrigate about 2,450 acre till Modakurichi. Due to encroachments, mixing of sewage and poor maintenance, the anicut lost its glory and sufficient water was not available for irrigation.

In 2016, the Madras High Court ordered the removal of encroachments in the water spread after which the farmers in the tail-end areas started receiving water. But the surface of the anicut was covered by hyacinth and other weeds affecting the water flow, said V. Muthu, a farmer in the area.

He said that the water weeds had reduced the oxygen level causing the death of fishes a few years ago.

He wanted the State Government to allot funds regularly to the Public Works Department for the maintenance of the anicut so that farming activity was not stopped.

While aquatic weeds covered up the water spread area of the anicut, mixing of sewage continued to be a major concern for the farmers. “Sewage from households, effluents and dumping of garbage continue in the canal,” said Kumaresan, a farmer at Nanjai Uthukuli. He wanted periodical maintenance carried out at the anicut and the canal so that the farmers, who depended on the canal, continued to carry out farming.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/uf1qd8/article30610031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA21ANICUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/farmers-want-periodic-maintenance-of-perumpallam-anicut/article30610032.ece
289,2020/01/21,Replacing of shutters at KRP Dam begins,"The replacing of seven of the eight shutters of KRP Dam began, two-and-a-half years after shutter I breached due to corrosion. The works have commenced just in time coinciding with the fall in water level in the reservoir to 29 feet.

In 2017, shutter I of the dam breached forcing out one TMC (full reservoir capacity) into the river, steering the spotlight on dam health and safety. Soon after, the breached shutter was dismantled and replaced under the State Government’s funds.

After two years, the remaining shutters are also being replaced under the World Bank’s Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Project (DRIP).

According to an official source, the works commenced when the stillway shutter’s sill level was 32 feet and the water level has fallen further to 29 feet on Monday.

The KRP reservoir’s full capacity of 52 feet was affected by the breach and the storage level shrunk to 42 feet, affecting the dam’s ayacut of about 9,012 acre.

However, farmers were resistant to replacement of shutters fearing further loss of storage during the period of works.

The Public Works Department’s Water Resource Organisation had called for a meeting with the water users in November, when it was decided by the farmers that works should commence even if they had to forego a cropping season, said the source.

Since the agreement period was 24 months, works on three shutters could have been taken up per season. But, the farmers did not want any further delay, the official said.

“Earlier, the farmers resisted early start of shutter works fearing the loss of cropping season. Finally, the drought conditions of March last forced them to step back from cropping until the shutters were replaced to enable the storage in the reservoir,” the official said.

The initial official estimate for the replacement of the seven shutters was ₹22.03 crore. The estimate was brought down to ₹19.07 crore (inclusive of GST) during the financial bid. Finally, the bid was given at ₹18.56 crore to Kwality Shutters, Tiruchi, and the agreement was inked with a completion period of 24 months for the project.

According to official sources, the project, however, is expected to be completed by this August, since the contractor has been asked to take up the works on two shutters simultaneously.

“It took two weeks to dismantle the first shutter (the breached one) earlier, during its replacement. This contractor dismantled all seven shutters in one week,” said the source.

The DRIP project envisions 80% funding by the World Bank and 20% by the State Government in the first five years, and on the ratio of 70:30 during the extension period.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/9emcaw/article30610018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA21SHUTTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/replacing-of-shutters-at-krp-dam-begins/article30610019.ece
290,2020/01/21,"Ranji Trophy | Sarfaraz, Lad come to the party","Sarfaraz Khan (132 n.o., 160b, 14x4, 6x6) and Siddhesh Lad’s (98, 174b, 10x4, 1x6) 210-run partnership for the fifth wicket ensured the last day of Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy Group B game against Uttar Pradesh will be anything but a drag at the Wankhede Stadium.

Thanks to the duo’s exploits, the host kept itself in the hunt for an improbable task of overhauling Uttar Pradesh’s first innings total of 625. However, UP’s defensive tactics paid off, 20-odd minutes before stumps, as Lad chased a wide one by part-time left-arm spinner Mohammad Saif to help the tourist’s regain the advantage.

At 353 for five, Sarfaraz and captain Aditya Tare will know that with the new ball just four overs old, they have an uphill task to get Mumbai back in the game.

The day, however, belonged to Sarfaraz and Lad, both of whom had a point to prove. While Sarfaraz was playing against UP for the first time since returning to Mumbai after a two-year stint with UP, Lad was coming into the game with just 30 runs from five innings this season.

Good start

But with a flat deck to their assistance, and rookies Bhupen Lalwani (43, 80b, 5x4) and Hardik Tamore (51, 94b, 10x4) having negotiated early moisture, the stage was set for the duo to turn the tide.

Sarfaraz looked fluent ever since replacing Lalwani before lunch, after the opener fell to an incoming delivery by pacer Wajid ali, while Lad was rusty at the start after Ankit Rajpoot’s skidder had breached Tamore’s defence.

While Lad played delightful cuts and drives, Sarfaraz drove with panache, even employing his trademark upper cut with aplomb. The standout feature of his innings was his temperament and the ability to break the shackles by taking the aerial route. When UP employed defensive tactics in the last session, Sarfaraz twice hit two sixes off consecutive balls, off Wajid and left-arm spinner Saurabh Kumar.

But more than the lofted drive off Wajid that sailed over the bowler’s head into the sightscreen, the pick of Sarfaraz’s knock was the on-the-rise six off Rajpoot over mid-off that landed in the stands.

The scores:

Uttar Pradesh — 1st innings: 625/8 decl.

Mumbai —1st innings: Jay Bista c Shaukat b Rajpoot 3, Bhupen Lalwani lbw b Wajid 43, Shashank Attarde c Saif b Rajpoot 9, Hardik Tamore b Rajpoot 51, Siddhesh Lad c Upendra b Saif 98, Sarfaraz Khan (batting) 132, Aditya Tare (batting) 9; Extras (b-4, lb-1, nb-1, w-2) 8; Total (for five wkts. in 90 overs): 353.

292,2020/01/21,Ranji Trophy | Ganesh Satish hits unbeaten century,"Continuing his splendid form, Ganesh Satish scored his 14th First Class century and third of the season to enable Vidarbha set a target of 347 for Delhi in their Ranji Trophy match at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground here.

Ahead by 16 runs on the first innings, Vidarbha launched a calculated assault on Delhi’s Ishant Sharma-less attack and declared at 330 for three.

When Delhi began the run-chase in fading light, the light-metre showed a reading of less than 3.9 thereby forcing Vidarbha to either press its spinners into service or let play be called off immediately. As a result of two overs of spin, Delhi openers escaped unscathed at 10 without loss.

Huge task

With 337 more runs required to win on Wednesday, Delhi will have to deal with fresh Vidarbha pacers for the better part of first session.

With Delhi’s batting failing quite consistently this season, Vidarbha has every reason to be optimistic of gaining six points. Moreover, with Ishant out of the match following a ligament tear suffered on his right ankle on Monday, Vidarbha needs one wicket less to win.

Tuesday’s proceedings began 45 minutes late due to poor light. Vidarbha’s top-order was among the runs with all five batsmen on view touching the 40-run mark.

Breakthrough denied

Skipper Faiz Fazal and Sanjay Ramaswamy denied Delhi any early breakthrough. After Fazal missed his half-century following a strokeful 43, Ramaswamy made a sedate 57.

Veteran Wasim Jaffer looked in fine nick during his controlled knock of 40. It was Jaffer’s dismissal, at 182, that signalled what turned out to be Vidarbha’s best phase of the day.

Ganesh Satish (100 out out, 92b, 11x4, 2x6) and Akshay Wadkar (70 not out, 82b, 7x4) accelerated the run-rate and raised 148 runs for the undefeated fourth wicket in 23.3 overs off a tiring and deflated Delhi attack.

The declaration came the moment Ganesh Satish completed his third century of the season. He had made 237 against Andhra and 145 against Punjab.

Vidarbha — 1st innings: 179.

Delhi — 1st innings: 163.

293,2020/01/21,Quinton de Kock named new captain of South Africa ODI squad,"Quinton de Kock has been named as the new captain of the South Africa One-Day International side, taking over from Faf du Plessis, who is dropped altogether for the three-match series against England next month.

Faf du Plessis led South Africa in their disastrous 2019 World Cup campaign and has hinted at international retirement from all formats following the Twenty20 global finals in Australia later this year.

“We all know the quality of the player that Quinton de Kock has grown to become,” CSA director of cricket Graeme Smith said in a statement on Tuesday.

“Over the years we have watched him grow in confidence and become one of the top ODI wicket-keeper batsmen in the world. He has a unique outlook and manner in which he goes about his business and is tactically very street smart.”

De Kock leads a 15-man squad with five uncapped players in seamers Lutho Sipamla and Sisanda Magala, spinning all-rounder Bjorn Fortuin, opening batsman Janneman Malan and wicketkeeper-batsman Kyle Verreynne.

Magala, leg-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi, seamer Lungi Ngidi and hard-hitting opening batsman Jon Jon Smuts must pass fitness tests before they can join the squad.

Fast bowler Kagiso Rabada will be rested for the series, while allrounders Chris Morris and Dwaine Pretorius have also not been able to force their way in.

294,2020/01/21,Arun Lal pleased with Bengal pace duo,"Nothing went wrong for Bengal in its match against Hyderabad. Little wonder, coach Arun Lal seemed so happy after his boys completed a resounding innings victory, with a day to spare, at the Bengal Cricket Academy ground on Tuesday.

“This is the best win we have had in recent time,” he said. “We played quite an immaculate match. The wicket didn’t turn as we expected and we had played three spinners.”

That meant Bengal went with just two seamers. But Akash Deep and Mukesh Kumar proved they were enough as they came up with a fabulous show, picking up 11 wickets between them. Ishan Porel, who is in New Zealand with the India A team, wasn’t missed at all.

“Akash and Mukesh bowled with a lot of venom,” Arun Lal said. “It was a good batting wicket but they bowled well. If we add Porel, I think we have the best seam attack in the country.”

He said he was pleased with the bowling of left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed, too. “But I was disappointed that neither Shahbaz nor (the other all-rounder) Arnab Nandi could reach a hundred,” he said. “There is good depth in our batting.”

He said the team was confident of making the knock-out stage. “We need another outright win,” he said. “We had one bad game (against Vidarbha).”

Hyderabad, on the other hand, has had just one good game. The win against Kerala is hardly consolation for a side that has lost all its other five matches.

But coach Arjun Yadav is not too disheartened. He has faith in his boys.

“We have a young team and we are building it,” he said. “It is too soon to criticise this team. With time and experience this team will mature and do well.”

He pointed out how the experience of Manoj Tiwary, whose 303 not out set up Bengal’s victory, made a big difference.

“Full credit to him for a great innings,” he said. “Our boys have to convert fifties into hundreds and three-wicket hauls into five-wicket ones.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/arun-lal-pleased-with-bengal-pace-duo/article30617055.ece
295,2020/01/21,"Want to play Jadeja’s role for Bengal and RCB, says Shahbaz Ahmed","Accurate left-arm spin bowling, excellent fielding and clearing the ropes with hefty hits, Bengal all-rounder Shahbaz Ahmed wants to be a ‘Ravindra Jadeja proto-type’ for Bengal and for Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) where skipper Virat Kohli might take interest in his skill-sets.

With a match-haul of six wickets and 49 runs in Bengal’s big win against Hyderabad, Shahbaz is now ready to shed the “outsider tag” having come from Haryana.

“I really love the way Ravindra Jadeja plays for India. I just like to play like him in Bengal,” Ahmed, who will share the dressing room with Indian captain Virat Kohli at Royal Challengers Bangalore in the upcoming IPL-2020, told PTI in Kalyani.

Shahbaz was sold to RCB at his base price of ₹20 lakh in the IPL auction as he is only the second player from Bengal, after pacer Ishan Porel, to feature in the 2020’s edition.

“I’m really excited to share the dressing room with Virat Kohli. This is a lifetime opportunity for me. If I get an opportunity to play in the IPL, I would just like to replicate the same there — contribute with bat and ball. It would help a lot in my career. But at the moment I’m focusing only on Ranji matches.”

Batting at Number eight, Shahbaz slammed missed his second halfcentury from seven matches by just one run after a suicidal runout, but he stood in a century-plus partnership with Tiwary.

Only two seasons ago, the Haryana-born Shahabaz, who had come to Kolkata in pursue of cricket, was termed an outsider and was suspended for a match for Tapan Memorial, till Cricket Association of Bengal conducted an investigation.

He went on to make his debut in 2018-19, against Hyderabad in an away match which was his solitary outing last season.

This season he played five matches for Bengal and contributed with a 50 in their win against Kerala.

“This is my second season. I’ve been playing here for last five years. I stay here, it’s my home now. I was a bit disturbed but thankfully the matter was quickly resolved.

“It’s all past now. I’ve got the full support of my team and coaches. I’m thankful to VVS Laxman and Arun Lal Sirs for backing me,” he said dedicating his hat-trick as he returned with 4/26 with match haul of six wickets.

First, he cleaned up Hyderabad’s top-scorer Jaweed Ali (72) before wrapping up Hyderabad first innings dismissing Ravi Kiran, Kolla Sumanth en route to claim Bengal’s first hat-trick since Mohammed Shami took against Madhya Pradesh in 2012-13.

“I never planned for the hat-trick. I just wanted to bowl in the right areas and repeat the same ball. I was lucky to get the hattrick. It came after a long time for Bengal,” Shahbaz said.

He also thanked Bengal spin bowling consultant Utpal Chatterjee who took charge for this match after bowling coach Ranadeb Bose was shunted out.

“The wicket was not turning much. But Sir gave a lot of confidence in the changing room. The atmosphere has changed since he has come. We get a lot of confidence now. He gives good ideas. he has got a lot of experience.”

On his journey the Mewat-born lad said: “I never played serious cricket in Haryana but only few matches in Gurgaon. But only after coming to Bengal, I got chance to play for BCCI. My coach there was Mansoor Ali.”

Shahbaz said he loves batting but now after playing longer versions his bowling has improved.

“I always loved batting. I was not bowling that well earlier it was only after playing three days cricket my bowling has improved. This performance will boost my confidence and also will help in the team combination being a bowling all-rounder,” he signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7sq913/article30616802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAHBAZAHMED,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/want-to-play-jadejas-role-for-bengal-and-rcb-says-shahbaz-ahmed/article30616803.ece
296,2020/01/21,Bengal completes massive win with day to spare,"There is no stopping this Hyderabad team, from crashing to humiliating defeats, that is.

The latest one came at the Bengal Academy Cricket Ground on Tuesday. And it came with a day to spare; that shouldn’t be a surprise, though the visitors had started the third day with five first-innings wickets still intact.

So if the match had to end on the penultimate day, the visitors had to lose as many as 15 wickets. They showed they were perfectly capable of that, gifting the host a much-needed victory, with a bonus point to boot.

The win — by an innings and 303 runs — has put Bengal back in the reckoning for a place in the quarterfinals. It has in fact moved to the second position with 19 points, just two behind the leader Andhra.

That also tells us how the times have changed. Andhra used to be the poor cricketing cousin of Hyderabad, which is now struggling to avoid relegation after losing five of its six matches. With six points, it is placed at the bottom of combined Groups of A and B, featuring 18 teams in all.

If it has to stay on among the elite teams, it has to bat better than it did here. Granted, Bengal bowled exceptionally well, especially its two seamers Akash Deep and Mukesh Kumar, but it was too good a wicket for a side to be dismissed for 171 and 161.

And this was a wicket on which one batsman alone — Manish Tiwary — made 303 in one innings, without getting dismissed. Come to think of it, he scored just 29 runs less than what all the 11 batsmen managed together, from two innings. Only Javeed Ali, who made 72 (108b, 12x4) in the first innings, and Ravi Teja who scored 53 (86b, 8x4, 1x6) in the second, showed some fight.

The day began disastrously, with Hyderabad losing a wicket off the fourth ball of the day. Captain Tanmay Agarwal was bowled by a ball that swung in from Mukesh.

The only break in the procession of the batsmen to the dressing came during the 10-minute interval between the two Hyderabad innings. The first one was ended in dramatic fashion with Shahbaz Ahmed taking a hat-trick.

The left-arm spinner isn’t a big turner of the ball, but his steady line and length was enough. Akash and Mukesh did the rest.

The scores:

297,2020/01/21,"NZ vs IND: On home turf, Kiwis will be a handful for India, says Taylor","The drubbing that New Zealand got from Australia still fresh in his mind, batsman Ross Taylor is hoping that the Black Caps will turn it around on home turf when they take on India in the upcoming limited-overs and Test series.

New Zealand lost the Test series 0-3 to their Trans-Tasmanian rivals recently. India, on the other hand, will go in to the five T20, three ODI and two Test series, on the back of resounding home ODI series victory over Australia.

“We were completely outplayed in all facets of the game throughout the whole series (against Australia) but now we’re back on home soil and India will be a totally different opposition,” Taylor was quoted as saying by the local media in Auckland after a practice session.

“They’re the No. 1 team in the world, but we’re obviously in conditions that we know, so let’s get through the white-ball phase first before we get on to talking about that (Tests),” Taylor added.

India’s New Zealand tour will begin with the T20 series in Auckland from Friday. It will be followed by the ODIs and Tests.

The New Zealand batsman also talked about the challenge all cricketing sides will face in Australia when they host the T20 World Cup later this year.

“It’s the first time a T20 World Cup is there and you watch the Big Bash, there are big boundaries so you are going to have to skin the cat differently than how you play in New Zealand and other parts of the world,” he said.

Much has been said about the negative impact of T20 cricket on the traditional five-day format. But Taylor hoped that game has enough room for all three formats to thrive.

“Not a lot of people knew what to expect in the first World Cup in South Africa in 07, but it’s grown a lot. Obviously the IPL came along not so long after. Quite often you used to play one, maybe two games, now we’ve got a five-match series.

“The game’s evolved and the shots that the men and the women are playing make it exciting for people to come along and watch. There’s been a lot of talk in recent times about (the future) of Test cricket and one-day cricket and Twenty20.

“Hopefully there’s room for all three, and Twenty20 for the next five matches anyway will be exciting and the New Zealand public will be looking forward to a good series,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/g1dmn6/article30615391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ROSSTAYLOR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-batsman-ross-taylor-on-the-upcoming-series/article30615392.ece
298,2020/01/21,Under-19 World Cup: India thrashes Japan by 10 wickets,"Defending champions India outclassed debutants Japan by 10 wickets in their second match to all but secure a spot in the quarterfinals of the ICC U-19 World Cup in Bloemfontein on Tuesday.

Opting to field first, four-time champions India bowled out a hapless Japan for 41 runs in 22.5 overs with leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi taking four wickets. It was the joint second lowest total by a team in the Under-19 World Cup and joint third lowest in the under-19 cricket history.

Pacers Kartik Tyagi and Akash Singh shared five wickets among themselves as none of the Japanese batsmen entered double digits.

India needed just 4.5 overs to complete the formalities with Yashasvi Jaiswal and Kumar Kushagra remaining unbeaten on 29 and 13 respectively.

In their tournament-opener on Sunday, India had beaten Sri Lanka by 90 runs.

The game on Tuesday was a complete mismatch with Japan playing a major ICC event for the first time.

India captain Priyam Garg, however, said his fast bowlers could have done a better job.

“Very happy with the performance. The spinners were good, but the lines and lengths could have been better from the pacers. There’s no pressure as such. We want to do well, we take every game as it comes,” said Garg.

Japan captain Marcus Thurgate said the team will head back home a lot richer in experience.

“I knew it was going to be a really tough game. We didn’t do our best, specially with the batting. We could have done better. We learnt a lot. We can go to Japan and say that we’ve played against some of the big guys,” he reflected.

“We’ll take a lot of positives from this game. We need to learn from our mistakes and keep getting better,” said Thurgate.

299,2020/01/21,"Character of pitches in New Zealand has changed, says Sachin Tendulkar","The pitches in New Zealand have become a lot more batting-friendly over the years, says iconic former batsman Sachin Tendulkar, insisting that India have the “ammunition” to trouble the sprightly hosts during the upcoming series.

Tendulkar, who has been on a record five New Zealand tours since 1990, feels that from seaming tracks during his early trips years, the tracks became high-scoring hard ones during his last tour back in 2009.

“Of late, the Tests in New Zealand have been high scoring and surfaces have changed,” Tendulkar told PTI during an exclusive interview.

India will play five T20 Internationals, three ODIs and two Tests during the tour starting with the shortest format on January 24.

From 2002, when India played ODIs and Tests on green tops, to 2009, when India won only their second Test series in 32 years, Tendulkar has seen it all in New Zealand.

“I remember when we played in 2009, the Hamilton pitch was different compared to other pitches. Other pitches got harder (Wellington and Napier) but not Hamilton. It remained soft.

“But Napier became hard with passage of time (where Gautam Gambhir scored an epic match-saving 12-hour hundred in 2009). So, from my first tour (in 1990 till 2009), I realised pitches got harder with passage of time,” Tendulkar said.

Tendulkar is confident that the Indian bowling attack, spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah, has the ammunition to put New Zealand in trouble.

“We have a good bowling attack with quality fast bowlers as well as spinners. I believe we have the ammunition to compete in New Zealand.”

However, in Wellington, Tendulkar wants the team to be well-prepared to counter the breeze factor.

“Wellington, I have played and it makes a huge difference if you are bowling with the wind or against the wind. The batsman needs to be judicious in the choice of which end he wants to attack, it is very important,” he said.

Tendulkar said he would prefer spinners to bowl against the breeze.

“...the seamers bowling against the strong breeze need to be smart. So I would prefer that if there is strong breeze, let the spinner bowl from that end and from the opposite end, the fast bowler bowls with the breeze behind him,” he said.

The maestro is confident that Rohit Sharma’s white ball experience will hold him in good stead in the Tests as well, an assignment that has been kept for the last leg of the trip, which begins with five T20 Internationals from January 24.

“The challenge would be to go out and open in different conditions. I think Rohit had opened in New Zealand in ODIs and has been there quite a few times, he knows the conditions well. Eventually, Test cricket is Test cricket,” he said.

“But all depends on surfaces that they provide. If they provide green tops, then it’s a challenge.”

There is no Bhuvneshwar Kumar or Deepak Chahar in limited-overs series but Tendulkar is not ready to press the panic button.

“Injuries are part and parcel of the game when you play and push your body to the limits.

“When you play for your country you need to give your best and while you give your best, you can get injured. That’s okay,” he concluded.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/3j1mic/article30614857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BASINRESERVE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-batting-maestro-sachin-tendulkar-on-new-zealand-pitches/article30614858.ece
300,2020/01/21,NZ vs IND: Dhawan ruled out of T20s due to shoulder injury,"India opener Shikhar Dhawan was Tuesday ruled out of the five-match T20 series in New Zealand due to a shoulder injury he suffered while fielding in the third ODI against Australia in Bengaluru.

“Yes, he has been ruled out of the T20 series. A replacement will be announced soon” a BCCI official told PTI.

Dhawan’s injury troubles have carried into the New Year and he did not come out to open during the successful run chase against Australia on Sunday.

The southpaw was taken for an x-ray after he hurt his left shoulder during fielding at the Chinnaswamy Stadim on Sunday.

K L Rahul came out to bat in his place alongside Rohit Sharma. Dhawan was seen wearing a sling on his left hand.

The 34-year-old Dhawan did not take the field for the entire duration of the Australian innings in the second ODI after a Pat Cummins bouncer hit him on the rib cage while batting.

Dhawan missed the entire limited overs series against West Indies last month.

He also had to pull out of the 2019 World Cup due to a fractured thumb, an injury he suffered against Australia. In the same game, he had scored a match-winning hundred.

Dhawan had scored 96 and 74 in the first two games of the current series against Australia.

Delhi-based Ishant suffered the injury during his third over in Vidarbha’s second innings in the ongoing Ranji Trophy match in New Delhi on January 20. He has been advised six weeks of rest after preliminary investigations revealed a grade three tear.

Though he came to the Ferozeshah Kotla ground on Tuesday and checked out his ankle-movements under the supervision of a physiotherapist, further treatment is set to continue at the National Cricket Academy, in Bangalore.

Considering the gravity of the injury, Ishant’s journey to his much-anticipated 100th Test appearance has clearly hit a road-block.

302,2020/01/21,Ranji Trophy | A memorable innings from Tiwary,"Manoj Tiwary can bat. If anyone had forgotten that, he served a reminder on Monday.

His unbeaten 303 against Hyderabad in Bengal’s Ranji Trophy match ought to be one of the finest innings of the season. The timing, the gorgeous drives, the clean hits over the rope, the technique and the ability to shift gears effortlessly… it was just great batting.

After watching him, you would have agreed totally with Bengal coach Arun Lal’s words at the end of the second day’s play at the Bengal Cricket Academy ground. “He should have played many more games for India,” said the former Test opener.

Tiwary has played 12 ODIs and three T20Is. The last time he played for India was in 2015.

His finest hour had come four years earlier. He had made 104 (retired hurt) against the West Indies in Chennai and was Man-of-the-Match in India’s 34-run victory.

But, he wasn’t selected for the following 14 matches of the Men in Blue. True, the problem with India’s batting is one of plenty. Yet, a batsman of his calibre deserved a better deal. He may be 34, but his batting is in supreme touch and he is quite fit.

“Right now the way the Indian team is, it is difficult,” said Tiwary, who has now 8752 First Class runs at an average of 51.79, with 27 hundreds. “But you never know what’s going to happen.”

Best knock

The triple hundred, he said, was the best innings of his life after the ODI century. “The thought of a making a triple had crossed my mind after many people messaged me at the end of the second day (when I was 156 not out),” he said.

“I want to thank my personal coach Manabendra Ghosh, who has always helped improve my skills.”

He said he didn’t regret that he could not get enough time to have a go at the record for the highest score by a Bengal batsman. Devang Gandhi had made 323 against Assam in 1998-99.

The two had featured in an incident last month. Gandhi, now a National selector, was evicted from Bengal’s dressing room following a complaint from Tiwary to the BCCI’s anti-corruption officials during the Ranji match against Andhra at the Eden Gardens.

“I will have my chances later,” said Tiwary smiling. “Let him be happy now.”

303,2020/01/21,"After 6-hour wait, Kejriwal files nomination from New Delhi","Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal filed his nomination for the New Delhi Assembly constituency around 6.30 p.m. on Tuesday, the last day to file papers, after waiting for over six hours.

Mr. Kejriwal had to wait at Jam Nagar House, where he filed the nomination, as 66 tokens were issued on the day to candidates filing their nominations. The AAP chief had reached the office around 12.30 p.m. and received token number 45.

At 2.36 p.m., Mr. Kejriwal tweeted from inside Jam Nagar House: “Waiting to file my nomination. My token no. is 45. There are many people here to file nomination papers. Am so glad so many people participating in democracy [sic].”

As he waited inside, several AAP leaders alleged that there was a conspiracy behind the “high number of people” filing nominations for the seat on the last day.

“Around 35 candidates sitting at RO office with CM [Kejriwal], without proper nomination papers, without even 10 proposers. They are calling their proposers on phone to come. They are insisting unless their papers are complete and they file nomination, they won’t allow CM to file nomination [sic],” AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said in a tweet.

Delhi Minister Gopal Rai, while addressing a press conference around 4.30 p.m., said no other seat has seen so many nominations and it seems to be “planned”.

Mr. Kejriwal stepped out of Jam Nagar House around 6.40 p.m. after filing the nomination.

Earlier in the day, the AAP chief had alleged that the Opposition parties were coming together with the single aim of defeating him, while he was working to provide better basic facilities to the people of Delhi.

‘Opposition vs Kejriwal’

“The BJP, the Congress and many other parties have come together... LJP, JJP, JD(U) and RJD. For the first time there is such a coalition in Delhi. All these parties only have one aim: ‘defeat Kejriwal’... I have only one aim, how to end corruption and take Delhi forward. They are saying ‘defeat Kejriwal’ and I am saying make schools and hospitals better. Their only aim is to get together and defeat Kejriwal,” he said.

Before going inside the RO office, Mr. Kejriwal said the moment marked the start of the next five-year journey. “The journey for the next five years starts from here. Like the good work that has happened in Delhi, I hope in the next five years also there will be good work,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal will hold eight town hall meetings between January 23 and January 30; he will also cover about 60 constituencies through roadshows, a spokesperson said.

Jan sabhas

On Tuesday, senior AAP leaders Manish Sisodia, Sanjay Singh, and Mr. Rai conducted separate jan sabhas in the city as party of the new campaign. Mr. Rai said that volunteers will take the guarantee cards to households from January 24 to February 2; the other two campaigns will go on till the elections.

Meanwhile, AAP Assembly elections in-charge Sanjay Singh said that former Delhi Minister Jitender Singh Tomar, who was declared as the party’s candidate from Tri Nagar on January 14, will not fight the elections and instead his wife, Preeti Tomar, will be given the ticket.

After AAP had declared its full list of candidates on January 14, the High Court on January 17 had set aside Mr. Tomar’s 2015 poll win for giving false declaration regarding his educational qualification in his nomination papers.

“After the court verdict, I told the party that my wife will fight the election and the party agreed,” Mr. Tomar said. Ms. Tomar filed her nomination on Monday.

Sitting AAP MLA from Delhi Cantt., Surender Singh, who was denied the party ticket, said he resigned from the party on Tuesday and added that he has joined the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). “I will fight the elections from Delhi Cantt. on the NCP ticket.

Party insiders claimed Mr. Yadav’s candidature had created “some friction” within its local unit what with some senior leaders associated with it questioning his candidature on the basis of his current “political stature”.

Delhi BJP spokesperson Tajinder Pal Bagga, who was also among the candidates chosen, will be fielded from Hari Nagar in West Delhi.

Sumanlata Shokeen from Nangloi Jat, Ramesh Khanna from Rajouri Garden, Manish Singh from Delhi Cantonment, Ravindra Chaudhary from Kasturba Nagar, Kusum Khatri from Mehrauli, Dharamvir Singh from Kalkaji, Dr. Anil Goyal from Krishna Nagar and Sanjay Goel from Shahdara were the other candidates declared.

Meanwhile, Mr. Yadav dubbed the contest between him and the Chief Minister a “local versus outsider battle”, which he said he was confident of winning. “If he is the Chief Minister, I am the chief of the youth wing of a national party. I was born, brought up and live in the New Delhi Assembly constituency. Unlike Kejriwal, who is not only from a different city and lives 40-odd km away from his constituents, I have shared both the joys and the sorrows of the people of this constituency,” Mr. Yadav told The Hindu.

Mr. Yadav said, on one hand, a significant part of the constituency, which falls under the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) did not have many takers for the Kejriwal government’s “freebies” and on the other hand, a sizeable population of its constituents residing in jhuggi jhopri clusters suffers from inflated power and water bills.

“Members of Parliament, political figures and bureaucrats who reside in the area will not fall for these tricks. Those who live in slum clusters complaint are full of complaints about inflated water and power bills,”Mr. Yadav said.

308,2020/01/21,"Rules amended under RTI Act, 2006: CIC Haryana","Reacting to the media reports stating that around 35% of the penalty imposed on officials under the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2006, was not collected, Chief Information Commissioner (Haryana) Yash Pal Singal said several steps have been taken by the commission for the past two years, including amendments in the rules, to ensure strict compliance in this regard.

Speaking to The Hindu, former Director-General of Police (Haryana) Mr. Singal said: “Earlier the law was silent who was responsible for the collection of penalty. No one worked on it for 12 years. But after I took over, first we got the rules amended in 2018 to make the Registrar responsible for it. We wrote letters, seeking penalty but the defaulter officials were reluctant to pay. It did not work,” said Mr. Singal.

He said it was then decided to fix the responsibility of the Drawing and Disbursing Officer to deduct the penalty amount from the salary of the defaulters and to take action against him in case he failed to do so.

“Besides this, we also decided that the defaulter official should not be issued the last pay certificate before he cleared his dues. In case of those nearing retirement, we decided that their ‘no dues certificates’ be withheld to pressurise them to pay the penalty. Also, it was decided to deduct the penalty amount from the pension of the defaulters. A letter was issued to all departments concerned in this regard in August last year,” Mr. Singal added.

He claimed the matter was again discussed in a meeting on January 16. “All our efforts have bore encouraging results. Also, the commission has imposed penalty in far more cases over the past five years than in the earlier period. We are committed to the effective implementation of the RTI Act and the to use the power at our disposal for this purpose,” said the official.

In reply to an application by RTI activist P.P. Kapoor, Haryana State Information Commission, Under-secretary Yagya Dutt Chugh has revealed that 1,726 defaulter officials, including many belonging to the Haryana Civil Services cadre, had not paid penalty to the tune of ₹2.27 crore till December 31, 2019. The commission had imposed fine on 2,974 officials against the appeals made to it for not sharing information. Of the total fine of ₹3.50 crore imposed, only ₹1.23 have been recovered so far.

Mr. Kapoor demanded setting up of an enforcement wing to ensure collect of penalty charges from the defaulters to ensure strict implementation of the RTI Act.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rules-amended-under-rti-act-2006-cic-haryana/article30618882.ece
309,2020/01/21,Court allows Bhim Army chief to visit Delhi,"A Delhi court on Tuesday modified its previous order granting bail to Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who was arrested in connection with the anti-CAA protest in Daryaganj last month, allowing him to visit Delhi for medical and election purposes.

However, the court directed Mr. Azad to inform the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) about the schedule of his visits. He is also required to stay at the local address given in the application.

Mr. Azad later released a statement on Twitter accusing the BJP-led Central government of trying to create a divide and destroying the “Ganga-Jamuni” culture in the country.

He said he along with his supporters would stop the party from coming to power in Delhi.

‘Confidence booster’

The Bhim Army chief said the court’s decision would further strengthen the public confidence in the judiciary. He called it a victory of the Constitution.

In an apparent reference to the ongoing protest at Shaheen Bagh, Mr. Azad said he would now be able to visit those sisters and mothers who had been agitating in Delhi and listen to their woes.

The court had granted bail to Mr. Azad on January 15.

312,2020/01/21,Couple held for cheating people through fake maid agency,"A man and his wife have been arrested for allegedly cheating people on the pretext of providing them domestic help, in south-east Delhi’s Kalkaji, the police said on Monday.

They used to charge a hefty amount for providing the help, who used to flee after stealing valuables from the house, an officer said. Both Gaurav Mandal (24) and his wife Sita (22) were nabbed following a tip-off from Tughlakbad Village, they said. On Saturday, a woman lodged a complaint alleging that she had hired a domestic help from an agency — Greater Kailash Maid Service — through its owner, Gaurav. She said that at 2.40 p.m., a man named Chandu came to her house with Sita and introduced her as a help. “Chandu took ₹33,000 from the complainant as commission. At 7 p.m., the help left the house without the complainant’s knowledge. The victim later found that no such maid service agency existed,” said DCP (South-East) Chinmoy Biswal.

Interrogation revealed that the man and his wife had come to Delhi and worked as a labourer and a maid respectively in south Delhi. They came in contact with a fraud maid providing agency, the DCP said. The duo along with the agency then started to dupe people on the pretext of supplying domestic help to earn money.

314,2020/01/21,Students take to streets ahead of CAA hearing in apex court,"Hundreds of students under the banner of ‘Young India against CAA-NRC-NPR’ took out a “public declaration protest” from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar on Monday, ahead of the Supreme Court (SC) hearing on the issue on Wednesday.

“It is not that we do not trust the SC, but if there is some force on the ground, there will be some pressure as well,” said Abhilasha, a student of Delhi School of Social Work. JNU student Keshav Anand said that with the present dispensation, it was hard to trust most of the institutions in the country.

Students raised slogans, sang songs on “azadi” in protest of the CAA and the NRC. Social activist Harsh Mander saluted protesters saying they should be proud that they had come out on the streets to stop the government’s “conspiracy to divide the country on hate”. “Many people asked if we would succeed. I believe we have already succeeded,” he said.

Former JNU student Umar Khalid saluted the protesters at Shaheen Bagh and attacked the government, arguing that it was asking for documents from citizens, but had removed transparency from electoral bonds.

Similar protests were held in other parts of the country as well, the group said in a statement.

In Delhi, the protesters were supported by Jamia Coordination Committee, ANHAD, JNUSU, Joint Forum for Academic and Social Justice, Karwan-e-Mohabbat, Shaheen Bagh Protest Committee (United Youth Brigade), We the People and other groups.

This march was held with an aim to appeal to the Supreme Court to strike down the “communal and unconstitutional” CAA, when it comes for hearing on January 22, the statement also read.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2lpxf7/article30610796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE21CAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/students-take-to-streets-ahead-of-caa-hearing-in-apex-court/article30610798.ece

Addressing protesters at Jamia Millia Islamia’s gate no.7, he said that the government would have to hold discussions with students as they will run the country tomorrow.

Jamia’s gate no.7 has turned into a protest site following the police action against the university students on December 15 last.

Mr. Jung, also the former Jamia Vice-Chancellor, condemned the police action at JMI, JNU and AMU.

‘Shameful incidents’

“We still do not know who were involved in it... Such incidents are very shameful for any democracy and the national capital,” he said, referring to the January 5 violence on the JNU campus.

Mr. Jung said that the CAA needed to be revamped and it should be made inclusive.

“There is a revolution happening at every nook and corner... You [government] will have to hold discussions with the students,” he said.

He lauded students and “sisters of Shaheen Bagh” for continuing their agitation against the CAA, saying the protest was not by Muslims alone, but by the entire country. “This Act was brought to segregate us but it has united everyone... This is the time for sacrifice and there are chances that you might have to offer some sacrifices...

316,2020/01/21,11 men held for betting during India-Australia cricket match,"Eleven men have been arrested for allegedly operating an inter-State cricket betting racket, the police said on Monday.

“The gang was operating during the ODI match between India and Australia, played in Bengaluru on January 19. We have recovered seven laptops, 74 mobile phones, two LCD TVs and four briefcases [specially made for holding and charging mobiles] during the raid,” said an officer.

Additional Commissioner of Police A.K. Singla said a team of Special Task Force, Crime Branch, received information about the racket.

“The team raided a house in Ashoka Niketan, Karkardooma, on January 19 when the match was in progress. The accused said bets worth over ₹5 crore had already been placed with them,” said Mr. Singla. The accused have been identified as Amit Arora (48), Anuj Arora (44), Ritesh Bansal (37), Ansul Bansal (27), Naveen Kumar (32), Rohit Sharma (34), Ritesh Aggarwal (38), Rohit Rastogi (34), Aman Gupta (22), Ankush Bansal (38) and Anurag Aggarwal (35).

The kingpin, Amit, allegedly told the police that gamblers called on specific numbers to place their bets.

The gang used specially designed betting software on their laptops to record and calculate bets placed during the match, the police said. Amit had arranged for three special phone connections called tota (parrot) lines, which he had bought from an operator in Delhi.

These lines kept repeating the current rates of betting after every ball on a loudspeaker, they said.

Amit would then relay these rates to all the punters, who placed bets with him.

Amit kept changing his hideout, the police said, adding that the house in Ashoka Niketan had been taken on rent recently by the gang.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/11-men-held-for-betting-during-india-australia-cricket-match/article30610714.ece
317,2020/01/21,"‘JNU biometric systems, CCTVs not broken in Jan. 3, 4 vandalism’","Neither biometric systems nor CCTV cameras were broken or destroyed at Jawaharlal Nehru University in the first week of January, according to the response to a Right to Information query, despite the administration’s claim that vandalism by students damaged these systems.

However, there is no continuous CCTV footage available from JNU’s main gate for the afternoon and night of January 5, when students and teachers were attacked on the campus, says the RTI response to a plea filed by Saurav Das, a member of the National Campaign for People’s Right to Information, on January 9.

CIS reply

The reply, from the university’s Communications and Information Services (CIS), exposes several discrepancies and ambiguities in the First Information Reports filed by the JNU security services on the night of January 5 and statements by the university administration.

One FIR claims that a group of student agitators entered the CIS office around 1 p.m. on January 4, by breaking open a glass back door. “They illegally trespassed the University property with the criminal intention to damage to the public property once inside they damaged the servers and made it dysfunctional and severely damaged the fiber optic cables power supplies and broke the biometric systems inside the room [sic],” said the FIR, asking for action to be taken against a number of students, including JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh.

Another FIR, also filed on January 5, alleges that the vandalism by students on January 3 severely affected a number of operations, including “biometric attendance and CCTV surveillance system”.

In a statement, JNU vice-chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar has claimed that the violence on January 5 had its origins in the vandalism which occurred on January 3 and 4. He also alleged that the broken biometric systems affected winter semester registration.

‘No damage’

Mr. Das, in his RTI plea, had asked for information on the “total number of broken/destroyed biometric systems at CIS office from December 30, 2019 to January 8, 2020”. The CIS response was “none”.

The RTI response also states that there are four CCTV cameras at the north or main gate of the JNU campus, although the university refused to give full details of the location of CCTV cameras citing “security reasons and concerns”.

When asked for details of all vandalised CCTV cameras from December 30 till January 8, the CIS response again was “none”.

There seems to be some ambiguity about the location of the servers where CCTV camera footage is stored.

Asked whether the CIS Office contains the servers of the CCTV cameras, the RTI response says they are “not located in CIS office but located in data centre”. However, in response to another query, it says, “The location of server room is at Hall #3, CIS, SBT Building of JNU.” It is not clear if these servers were affected by the alleged vandalism at the CIS office.

With regard to the fibre-optic cables used in the CIS servers, the RTI response says 17 such cables were damaged around 1 p.m. on January 4.

The RTI response also says that “no continuous and entire CCTV footage” of the north gate cameras between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m. on January 5 was available with JNU. It adds that “no CCTV camera footages are uploaded continuously to the JNU Cloud Computing Platform”.

This seems to indicate there may be no CCTV record of the January 5 attacks.

The JNU website continued to function during this period as it was “critical” and “running from alternate backup arrangement during this period”, says the RTI response. It is not clear whether there were any alternative backup arrangements for CCTV cameras.

One of the FIRs detailing vandalism has a “date of occurrence” listed as January 1. However, in its response, CIS said there were only two incidents when JNU’s main server was shut down during that week — at 1.30 p.m. on January 3; and the same time on January 4, “due to power supply disruption”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7bvek4/article30600063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-biometric-systems-cctvs-not-broken-in-jan-3-4-vandalism/article30610681.ece

It added that the remaining students are also expected to complete their registration process since the registration is still open with a late fee.

“The university is putting every effort to help the willing students register for the winter semester. The campus is peaceful and active in pursuing academic activities,” Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar said in a statement. He added that the university is also gearing up to celebrate Republic Day and that this year, for the first time, the NCC cadets of JNU will be participating in a parade at the venue of flag-hoisting during the Republic Day celebrations.

“During our meeting with the BJP, our oldest ally, we were asked to reconsider our stand on CAA but we declined to do so. SAD is of the firm stand that Muslims cannot be left out of CAA... We are also strongly against the NRC,” said SAD leader Manjinder Sirsa, who won on a BJP ticket from Rajouri Garden said.

He said: “The diversity of India is the strength of our unity. We cannot compromise on this vision for which ancestors have made supreme sacrifices...there are strong ideological differences between the two parties on the issue of the CAA on which the SAD wants the Muslims to be included in the Act, and on NRC which the SAD can never support,” he added.

The SAD said it was , it said in a statement, was firm that all minorities, including Muslims along with Sikhs, Hindus, Christians, Jains, Parsis, Buddhists who were facing persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh “had to be protected by our great nation.”

321,2020/01/21,AAP’s guarantee card a proof of its failures: Goel,"The Delhi BJP on Monday said that the ‘guarantee card’ issued by the Arvind Kejriwal-led government was a proof of its failure.

Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel said Mr. Kejriwal had issued a “guarantee card, but who will give the guarantee of his assurances”.

‘Failures of AAP’

“These guarantees are the failures of AAP. Kejriwal did not complete the works which were to be done during the last five years. On the issue of pollution, I challenge the Chief Minister to show any work done...He is giving a guarantee of improving the air quality but who will believe it,” Mr. Goel demanded.

He further said Delhi should have the services of 11,000 buses but out of the 5,000 buses here, over 1,000 are out of service.

“He [Kejriwal] could not procure more than 100 buses during the last five years and admitted that his tenders have failed again and again and even after that he is giving guarantee of providing world-class transport system,” Mr. Goel argued.

The most important issue was that of drinking water in which Mr. Kejriwal had “completely failed”, Mr. Goel said, adding that “'Har Ghar Nal Se Shuddh Jal” was a Central government scheme.

Similarly, the former Delhi BJP chief said basic amenities to be provided in unauthorised colonies or Jahan Jhuggi Wahan Makan, which is also a Central government scheme but Mr. Kejriwal was “misleading the people” by including these in his guarantees.

“Kejriwal has distributed fake certificates in the name of survey of jhuggies and termed it as Mukhyamantri Aawas Yojna, which is completely false. There has been a manifold increase in the sale of air and water purifiers besides that of mineral water, which show Kejriwal’s failure in these sectors,” Mr. Goel alleged.

“Kejriwal had promised to add 30,000 beds in government hospitals but could not add even 300. There are 400 ventilators in government hospitals out of which 50 do not work. He had promised to open 900 primary health centers but not a single opened...,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aaps-guarantee-card-a-proof-of-its-failures-goel/article30610666.ece

Mr. Kejriwal was scheduled to file his nomination for the Delhi Assembly elections before 3 p.m. on Monday but will now do it on Tuesday as he “did not feel like leaving behind the people at the roadshow”.

The AAP leader, perched atop an open jeep accompanied by his wife and two children, took out a two km-long roadshow from Valmiki Mandir on Mandir Marg to Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place.

The rally went on for over two hours as supporters raised slogans of “Lage raho Kejriwal” amid drum beats, songs, and dancing. At the end of the roadshow, Mr. Kejriwal said: “Friends, I am touched by this overwhelming support. I love you. We have worked really hard in these five years to improve the lives of the people of Delhi. We have tried to improve the lives of all sections. We have worked with honesty in the last five years, and today marks the beginning of gearing up for the next five years.”

“I prayed to Lord Shiva in the morning, sought the blessings of Lord Valmiki at Valmiki Mandir, and visited Hanuman Mandir to pray to Lord Hanuman that the next five years should be equally fulfilling. I hope that people are happy with the development of Delhi in the last five years. The last five years have passed very well and I am sure the next five will also be just as good for Delhi. I hope that you will bless us in the same way you blessed us five years back,” he added.

Mr. Kejriwal said that less than three weeks are left for the elections and he wants everyone to go door-to-door to urge people to vote for AAP in the elections on February 8.

Sharing the significance of Valmiki Mandir, Mr. Kejriwal had tweeted in the morning: “AAP has begun many chapters of its journey from the historic Valmiki Mandir in New Delhi.

Sanjeev (27) from Haryana’s Rohtak was nabbed from Shamshan Ghat in Delhi's Haiderpur where he had come to supply the consignment of illegal weapons to one of his city-based contacts, they said while the second accused — Noor Hasan (25), was nabbed from his residence in Meerut following a raid.

One need not be well-versed in the sastras to seek Him; nor do jnana, bhakti, vairagya and viveka depend on one’s birth, status, livelihood, etc.

The verses on the whole instil bhakti bhava that is synonymous with Dasya Bhava, a significant trait fostered in the devout by the Vaishnava tradition, pointed out Sri Srinivasa Gopala Maha Desikan in a discourse. First of all the devotee is trained to see himself as a servant of the Lord and be aware of his status as one treading the journey to salvation. So it follows that the jivatmas’ prime duty is to pay obeisance to the Paramatma, who is the supreme and sole refuge for all. Serving the Lord with simple offerings and with hearts filled with love is no doubt the practice of devotees. But as devotion takes root, one realises like Nammazhwar that true devotion finds fulfilment in serving the devotees of the Lord.

Azhwars too take pride in being at the lowest rung in the hierarchy of servants who serve the Lord. True devotion leads one to believe that the dust from the feet, the ‘adi podi’ of ‘tondars,’ bhaktas, can purify the mind and rid one of sins. Andal shows this bhava as predominant in the Gopis observing the Katyayani vrata in Ayarpadi whose only desire is to nurture their ‘feeling of relation’ with Krishna.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/true-devotion/article30617828.ece
326,2020/01/21,Two choices,"Each one always has two choices, the good and the beneficial on the one hand and the pleasant and enjoyable on the other. The two are divergent and lead one into different paths. If good is chosen, one is blessed and will tread the path to God and attain salvation. This is how Yama begins to explain to Nachiketas, in the Katopanishad, the secret of immortality, pointed out Sri Ramanujam in a discourse.

Owing to a misunderstanding with his father, young Nachiketas goes to Yama Loka. Since Yama is away, the boy waits outside his house for three nights. When Yama returns he tries to make amends for having made a guest wait thus. He grants him three boons and as the third boon Nachiketas tells Yama that he wishes to know the answers for esoteric truths such as the atma, God and also about what happens after one’s life on earth. Knowing that this secret and sacred knowledge is hard to imbibe even by celestial beings, Yama asks Nachiketas to choose some other boon. But the boy is resolute and knows that there is no better teacher than Yama and no other boon equal to this. Now Yama tests the boy and offers him all the pleasures of the various worlds to dissuade him from seeking this boon. But Nachiketas does not budge and proves to be an ideal disciple.

Like Nachiketas all are endowed with the ability to discriminate between what is good and pleasant. But a majority of the people get drawn to the reality of the present world and its attractions and desire to enjoy these rather than even care to think about the higher plane of existence that has to be sought. They end up in the endless cycle of birth. Only a few have the inner motivation to choose the right as they know what is truly better, preferable and superior.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/two-choices/article30610832.ece

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Hyderabad – II was dealing with a complaint filed by Varada Jyotsna, a resident of Moosapet, who said that soon after buying the dishwasher in 2017, the dishwasher failed to fully clean utensils. The complainant also said that despite authorised technicians inspecting the dishwasher, the problem persisted.

For their part, Bajaj Electronics stated that they cannot be held liable for any manufacturing defect, and that it is the manufacturer’s responsibility.

IFB Industries Ltd. contended that the complainant was not using the dishwasher per user manual instructions, and claimed that the ‘quality of the machine mainly depends on softness of water’. It also stated that the water which the complainant used was hard water and that was the reason for the dishwasher not working properly. The company then sought dismissal of the complaint.

After taking into account the evidence and arguments, the forum noted that the user manual indicates different settings for the machine corresponding to the hardness or softness of water. It concluded that hard water can be used in the dishwasher at a particular setting. The forum also noted that the user manual differs from the sole contention of the company, and stated that there was a deficiency in service.

The forum directed the complainant to return the dishwasher to the respondents. Apart from directing Bajaj Electronics and IFB Industries Ltd. to jointly refund the amount and pay ₹10,000 as compensation, the forum imposed costs of ₹5,000.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bajaj-electronics-ifb-to-refund-money-for-faulty-dishwasher/article30618996.ece

330,2020/01/21,New ride-sharing option for Hyderabad metro rail users,"Hyderabad Metro Rail, L&T Metro Rail and redBus have joined hands to provide last and first mile connectivity with the launch of bike and car pool services.

CEO of redBus, Prakash Sangam told mediapersons on Monday that it allows office-goers to avail and offer rides on their respective bikes or cars while commuting between home and workplaces. Ride givers and takers are both connected through rPool on the redBus app and users can purchase points which can be redeemed at fuel stations, Paytm, Amazon and similar wallets. These can be purchased through credit/debit cards, wallets, etc.

For now, rPool is not taking any commission and has put the price between ₹0-5 for car pool per kilometre and ₹0-4 rupees for a bike ride with each ride giver entitled to four such trips a day as per international practice, he said. Users can create ride with their source, destination, date and time to find matching riders, invite them, confirm and travel. Ride givers have to share vehicle details and route plan in addition.

Privacy and safety

Mr. Sangam assured absolute privacy and safety for both parties as calls and chats between ride giver and taker are ‘masked’.

Further, the giver can map the route for a taker to join in only if it is on the same route. “All transactions are online and we also verify the mobile number and company e-mail ID is a must for registering. We check the vehicle registration and driving licences, too” Mr. Sangam said.

If the organisation e-mail ID is not available, users will have to provide Government-mandated ID cards like PAN and Aadhaar. Ratings are to be given for ride givers and takers, and those will be visible to users. Metro rail authorities have offered to provide free parking and designated slots at all stations, he explained.

Pilot studies have shown that the average cost of bike/car pooling is way below the cost of hailing auto or cabs, he claimed, hence it can be best option for metro rail passengers for reaching offices or homes.

For instance, from Raidurg station to Financial District, it would cost just ₹45 whereas it could be ₹147 by cab and ₹110 by auto, said Mr. Sangam.

Free insurance cover is being given for both parties and about 1,000 metro smart cards with ₹50 prepaid is to be give away to promote the concept. There are international studies to point out that shared rides are more economical, put less vehicles on road and give impetus to public transport. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology research showed 3,000 shared cars is equal to 13,000 taxis, he added.

HMR MD N.V.S. Reddy pointed out that varied solutions are necessary to reduce traffic congestion as public transport too needs first and last mile connectivity. With more patronage, he expects the price to come to be between ₹2/3 per km.

There will not be any issue with regulatory authorities since this is not commercial service but shared service for benefits of cutting down vehicles on road, pollution and encouraging public transport, he said.

332,2020/01/21,"‘Innovation, infra, inclusive growth will propel India to greatness’","Information Technology (IT) Minister K.T. Rama Rao firmly believes in the three I’s mantra — Innovation, Infrastructure and Inclusive growth if India has to propel itself into greatness.

Participating in a panel discussion organised by a TV channel at the World Economic Forum being held in Davos, Mr. Rama Rao said the three key factors were necessary for States emerging stronger and the nation automatically. He said he had brought this idea to the notice of Prime Minister Narendra Modi too.

Recalling Tech Legend John Chambers’ view that next million jobs would be generated by the next generation of industries from start-up ecosystem rather than the Fortune 500 companies, he said innovation was emerging as highly promising ecosystem and that too from the unlikeliest of locations in India. “We will look to leverage this aspect.”

The IT Minister felt that India was emerging as one of the most compelling business stories that the World cannot ignore now and this was due to the ‘engine room population’ that comprises 40% of the population. This young group between 20 to 40 years is a huge advantage that India has and no other country can match this human resource. He said the Telangana government has been focussing on three key factors including Ease of Doing Business, lowering the cost of doing business and improving the quality of doing business. The State has topped India in the Ease of Doing Business in the past several years. These factors, he argued, will help States focussing on Innovation and the Central government can supplement these efforts through infrastructure development.

Mr. Rama Rao said though the policies are made in New Delhi the actual work is in the States, and hoped that the Centre will give Telangana a major share of the funds it was planning to invest.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/q6k0fs/article30618241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy22KTRroche,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/innovation-infra-inclusive-growth-will-propel-india-to-greatness/article30618242.ece

Alleging that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was driving the State towards dictatorship, he said where was the need to conduct the legislative session in such a situation.

The AP legislature buildings were fortified with hundreds of police personnel and the Chief Minister himself was attending the session with 300 police as security.

Kiran Kumar Reddy, alleged that the police did not spare even the aged persons and women during Monday’s protest in Amaravati, where they had gathered to protest tabling of the bills pertaining to relocation of the State capital. By caning the protesters brutally, the AP government had trampled the democratic rights of people to protest. The State government did not even heed to the High Court observations in the matter of tackling the protests linked to the relocation of the capital.

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, while hearing a PIL plea on failure of authorities to check Kukatpally tank’s pollution, sought to know why cannot the officials deploy watchmen to keep a tab on persons polluting the tank. Noting that failure to protect water bodies would have serious ramifications for the society as a whole, the bench said the authorities should explore means to check polluting the tank. The guards at the tank should be provided with mobile phones so that they alert the authorities when someone is found throwing garbage into the tank, the bench said. The CJ observed that undertaking construction work within Full Tank Level (FTL) areas of tanks and releasing industrial discharge made the tanks in Bengaluru, breeding centres of pollution.

Expressing dissatisfaction over the counter filed by the authorities in the PIL petition, the CJ said they could not even provide specific information as to when they had cleared the garbage from the tank. They provided photos relating to the matter but failed to explain when they were clicked, the bench said. How to ascertain if the photos are old or taken recently, the bench asked.

The GHMC standing counsel told the court that precise information relating to removal of garbage from the tank and the photos would be presented before the court. The counsel also submitted to the court that flowers were thrown into the tank by people during Bathukamma festival and even Lord Vinayaka idols were also immersed in it during Ganesh festival. The garbage was removed from the tank once every fortnight, the court was informed.

The matter was posted to February 7 for next hearing. Meanwhile in another PIL plea relating to ‘pollution being caused by Jawaharnagar Dumping Yard’, the bench instructed the GHMC Commissioner to personally appear before it. The HC took up a letter written by citizen stating that garbage being dumped at Jawaharnagar is emanating foul smell, posing serious threat to the health of people living in and around Sainikpuri, Yapral and Kapra. While the government counsel explained steps being taken by the government, the bench passed order directing the GHMC to appear before it on January 27.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ghmc-chief-can-resign-if-he-is-unable-to-discharge-duties-hc/article30610108.ece

GHMC’s Town Planning wings’ road widening veterans Shankar Narayana and Chakravarthy, on deputation, were at the forefront. “I gave them total freedom. We were ready to meet anyone to convince them about the project,” he adds.

Negotiations

While Chikkadpally protests fizzled out, agitation erupted at Sultan Bazar and it took a painstaking 1.5 years to bring shopkeepers around with L&T Metro Rail Hyderabad told to build the viaduct into the narrow strip within 65 metres road width.

“Not a single crane was allowed to operate during that time. We conceived of Pulti Bowli municipal complex and another senior engineer B.N. Rajeshwar, with advantage of local contacts, negotiated,” explains Mr. Reddy.

Meanwhile, Telangana was formed and the new government was given five alternative options but every other route involved “moving into Osmania Medical College, Koti’s Women’s College and Kacheguda railway station”, so the original alignment remained.

HMR officials recall business leaders like Keshava Rao, Kishan Yadav, Surender Lonia, Govind Rathi initially staunchly opposed, but slowly allowed the rail to snake in. “Business in the corridor was not disrupted from Secunderabad station up to Rang Mahal even when cranes were running. I was worried about their safety as each of the segments weighed 40 tonnes,” he points out.

“I don’t think any other project faced the opposition we did. Looking back, I cannot believe how we worked. It was sheer madness and passion. We reached out to the masses through songs at all Ganesh pandals on the project positives which ensured the majority was with us,” avers the metro rail MD.

What about the route till Falaknuma? “It is within reach and we will take it as and when possible. [There are] no regrets as such,” adds Mr. Reddy.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/x9eth/article30610057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20METRORAIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyderabad-metro-rails-green-line-set-for-launch-of-commercial-operations/article30610044.ece
342,2020/01/21,Ensuring a life of dignity to children with special needs,"Timely help to the needy goes a long way in building a better society, said former deputy chief minister and senior TRS leader Kadiyam Srihari.

He was addressing physically challenged students at a specially organised function called ‘Divyang Utsav’ where the Kadiyam Foundation distributed uniforms, books and study material to 500 children studying in seven special schools. Each institution was given ₹30,000 to buy computers, printers and photo copy machines.

He said he studied at various social welfare hostels and schools, and has experienced poverty and how it affects the psyche of people, especially children. “I know the pain and difficulties of children. Now I am happy that I have been able to establish a number of social welfare residential schools across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh during my political career,” he said.

Monday coincided with his 40th wedding anniversary for which he and his wife, Vinaya Rani, planned ‘Divyang Utsav’ to bring cheer to children in need.

His daughter Kadiyam Kavya, a medical practitioner, has also been engaged in a massive campaign on menstrual hygiene and distribution of free sanitary napkins to girl students in government schools across the erstwhile Warangal district for the past several years.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ezmqcy/article30610024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20-WARNGAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ensuring-a-life-of-dignity-to-children-with-special-needs/article30610025.ece
343,2020/01/21,Kochi Corporation pulls up CSML for going slow on projects,"The Kochi Corporation council on Monday pulled up Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) officials for their lackadaisical performance in implementing Smart City projects. Funds worth crores of rupees allotted to the city under the scheme could lapse if work was not accelerated, councillors pointed out.

With just a little over 70 days remaining for projects under the scheme to be tendered and awarded as per Central government guidelines, work has begun only on 18 of the 42 projects being executed by CSML. Of the ₹970 crore set aside for the projects, only work worth ₹592.11 crore had been tendered. If contracts for the remaining projects were not awarded by March 31, the funds allotted for them could lapse.

While the mission has already received funds worth ₹401.77 crore since its inception in 2016, only a meagre 7.8%, amounting to ₹84 crore, has been utilised.

“A utilisation certificate for the received amount will have to be presented before additional funds are released,” said councillor V.P. Chandran at the special council meeting convened to discuss Smart City projects.

Work has begun on projects including smart roads, a public bicycle sharing project, a cancer ward at the Ernakulam General Hospital, new blocks at the Kochi taluk hospital and the Mattancherry Women and Children’s Hospital, Intelligent Traffic Management System and beautification of the area around the Dutch Palace, Mattancherry.

Significant projects

Councillors expressed concern over the lack of progress on significant projects like the ₹16-crore-worth slum redevelopment project.

According to CSML officials, the Corporation council would have to present a list of slums where land ownership rights were clear to the Special Purpose Vehicle before any work could be undertaken. P.M. Harris, chairperson of the Works Standing Committee, pointed out that there was no clarity on the renovation of the Ernakulam market either, though ₹100 crore was set aside for the ambitious project. Shop owners were to be shifted to a nearby disputed property during the period of renovation, but no conclusive agreement could be signed with them till the dispute was settled, he said.

CSML has listed five projects, including market renovation and CCTV installation, which are likely to be tendered this month. A tender will also be called this month for construction of the second tower under the Rajiv Awas Yojana for landless families at Kalvathy.

As many as nine projects have remained stalled at the tender stage, with tenders being invited multiple times to no responses. Work worth ₹7 crore on the Marine Drive walkway beautification project has not been taken up yet though tenders were invited four times.

Sewerage project

Though the contract has been awarded for the ₹166-crore sewerage project for West Kochi, the anxieties of residents at Kalvathy over the presence of a sewage treatment plant in their neighbourhood have not been allayed. “Since the project cannot proceed without the cooperation of the residents, CSML might consider alternative land to set up the plant,” said Mayor Soumini Jain.

Residents had earlier suggested that the plant could be set up on an acre of land belonging to the Cochin Port Trust near the customs jetty at Kalvathy, said Zeenath Rasheed, councillor representing Kalvathy.

CSML officials pointed out that though the land was ideal, a slew of permissions would have to be obtained from the Central government since the site was located beside the customs jetty, and the Customs Department could raise objections, further delaying the process. Considering that the area was a heritage zone, finding alternative land was a tough ask, they said.

Discussions would be held with the Port Trust to consider use of its land and a stakeholder meeting along with the residents in the area would be held soon, Ms. Jain announced.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-corporation-pulls-up-csml-for-going-slow-on-projects/article30612652.ece
344,2020/01/21,Congress suspends Gracy Joseph,"The District Congress Committee (DCC) has suspended Kochi Corporation development standing committee chairperson Gracy Joseph indefinitely from the party for defying its diktats.

Despite two orders being issued to resign from her position as chairperson, Ms. Joseph had not done so, publicly dishonouring the party, read a notice issued to Ms. Joseph on Monday by DCC President T.J. Vinod.

Failure to comply with the orders resulted in the suspension. But the DCC’s move will not affect Ms. Joseph’s position in the council. In the upcoming standing committee chairperson elections, she would still be bound by the party’s whip, said Mr. Vinod.

The development standing committee was likely to move a motion of no-confidence against Ms. Joseph and was awaiting the DCC’s approval for the move, said a Congress councillor.

In spite of the suspension, Ms. Joseph on Monday resolutely stood by her refusal to resign and said that she would continue as chairperson. “With only seven months till the end of the council’s term, a change of guard is unnecessary. The positions of the three chairpersons who resigned are still lying vacant. At a time when the focus should be on plan fund projects and the budget, attention is on multiple elections instead,” said Ms. Joseph. Going by the UDF’s seat-sharing agreement, all Congress standing committee chairpersons were to resign two-and-a half years into their term.

All chairpersons were asked to resign in November, but Ms. Joseph had asked for an extension till December 20 to ensure the completion of work that the standing committee had taken up.

But when the UDF fared poorly in the elections to the town planning standing committee in December, handing a majority in the committee over to the LDF, Ms. Joseph refused to resign, inviting a 48-hour ultimatum from the DCC to relinquish her post.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cj74j6/article30610700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GRACYJOSEPH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/congress-suspends-gracy-joseph/article30610701.ece
345,2020/01/21,Container lorry drivers to go on strike,"A group of drivers of lorries serving the International Container Transshipment Terminal at Vallarpadam will go on a strike from Tuesday after discussions convened by labour authorities on issues related to use of container scanners and possible health risks associated with it failed.

A statement issued by the Trade Union Coordination Committee, representing container lorry workers and crew, said talks convened by Regional Joint Labour Commissioner Suresh Kumar on Monday to reconcile the differences of opinion between container lorry crew and drivers and the authorities did not reach a consensus.

There are around 1,900 container lorries serving the Cochin Port and container terminal facilities. Thirty per cent of the lorries served the container terminal, said sources. A group of the drivers will be on strike. However, sources said the strike was not likely to seriously affect business at the container terminal.

Cochin Port Trust sources said the strike was based on unfounded allegations that the scanner deployed at the container transshipment terminal posed a health risk.

Sources said a medical board was constituted to examine the claims by drivers that the scanner was a health risk. However, the report did not substantiate any of the health risk claims by the drivers.

The report had also said that the pool of drivers set up to drive the containers through the scanner could be done away with as the scanner did not pose a health risk. However, with the pool system ending on January 20, the drivers had come out with a demand to continue with it. The labour authorities had convened the meeting on Monday to resolve the differences of opinion on the issue.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/container-lorry-drivers-to-go-on-strike/article30610697.ece
346,2020/01/21,Clarification sought on ‘love jihad’,"The ‘love jihad’ issue continues to smoulder in the Syro-Malabar Church with a group of priests of the Ernakulam-Angamaly Archdiocese deciding to write to the members of the Permanent Synod of the Church, demanding a clarification on its stand that Christian women were being trapped in love affairs, some of them even joining the Islamic State.

A resolution adopted by the 28th Synod was read out in some of the parishes of the Church on Sunday.

The public stand of the bishops’ council was adopted without consulting believers. It would affect the six million believers of the Church, said Father Kuriakose Mundadan, secretary of the Presbyteral Council of the archdiocese, here on Monday.

He said priests were of the view that the Synod must correct its stand on the issue.

Since there was no time for the Presbyteral Council to meet and pass a resolution, some of the senior members would write to the Synod, he said.

Fr. Mundadan said, “Terrorism has no religion.” It was inappropriate and imprudent for the bishops to have made a statement linking love jihad and Christian women. The priests felt that terrorism, involving persons of any religion, needed to be condemned. Fr. Mundadan said priests and the community of believers of the Syrian Catholic Church had also expected the bishops to come out with a strong statement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). However, the Synod had passed a “watered down statement” on the issue. The CAA needed to be condemned, he said.

Fr. Jose Vailikodath, another senior member of the Presbyteral Council, also expressed strong opposition to the bishops’ position. Meanwhile, the Syro-Malabar Church Media Commission has called for caution against attempts to paint the Church’s stand on the CAA as pro-BJP, and the bishops’ demand for investigations into ‘love jihad’ as anti-Muslim.

A communication from the media commission reiterated the stand taken by the Synod and appealed to the Union government to allay any anxiety regarding the CAA. The bishops had also demanded that the Constitution of India and its fundamental and holy principle of secularism should be preserved. They had also called on the government to provide shelter and citizenship to refugees in the country without considering their religious affiliation, the commission said. The cultural background of the Northeastern States should be given special consideration when refugees were resettled, they had demanded.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/clarification-sought-on-love-jihad/article30610693.ece

Both the teaching and non-teaching staff as well as Kudumbasree volunteers too supported the initiative by making pens along with them.

According to P.S. Sheeba, faculty in the Department of Chemistry, who is one of the coordinators of the Green Initiative in the college, it is part of the ongoing eco-friendly projects there. “Four students from each class were initially trained in paper pen making by the entrepreneurship development club. On Tuesday at 2.30 p.m., all of them trained around 1,800 students simultaneously,” she said.

Principal Godwin Samraj, college manager Joseph Daniel, internal quality assessment cell coordinator Sreejith M. Nair, and parent-teacher association secretary Haridasan also made paper pens.

Ms. Sheeba said the pens thus made would be kept at the college store from where students could purchase them at cheap rates. “Gradually, they will be encouraged to always use paper pens,” she added.

Only steel glasses were being used in the college since 2017, and paper cups and plates were being avoided, said a college source. Cloth banners have replaced plastic flex boards.

While jumping into a river to retrieve the cross the priest had tossed in, she never guessed her being a woman could create so many problems. Petrunya’s fight for her rightful cross in God Exists, Her name is Petrunya was the ideal beginning for a festival that was intended to celebrate women’s place in a man’s world.

The second edition of the Women’s International Film Festival of Kerala was opened in Kozhikode on Tuesday with the Macedonian film directed by Teona Strugar Mitevska.

The opening day of the festival was also marked by six other films – Bibtya by Gargee Kulkarni, Checkmate by Ekatara Collective, Phir Ek Subah by Indira Aditi Rawat, Suffragette by Sarah Gavron, Paikinjana Chiri by Leela Santhosh and Unlimited Girls by Paromita Vohra.

Safragette, the only non Indian movie of the lot, was based on the history of British feminist movement demanding right to franchise for women. Leela Santhosh, the first Adivasi film-maker of Kerala, made her mark through the movie Paikinjana Chiri made in the Paniya language.

Kerala Chalachitra Academy Chairman Kamal, who gave up his duty to declare the festival open to actor Anumol, said there has been a rise in women’s involvement in cinema in the recent years. Ms. Anumol said that cinema in India is still caught up in the male gaze and expressed the need for it to come out of it.

349,2020/01/21,"‘Untruths, half-truths being spread about land reforms’","As the two mainstream Communist parties are competing with each other to claim credit for land reforms in the State on its 50th anniversary, a leading economist has claimed that “truths, half-truths and untruths” are being propagated about the legislation.

M. Kunjaman, Professor, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Tijapur campus, said here on Tuesday that land reforms had not led to any kind of development as being claimed by its spokespersons. He claimed that it had led only to the emergence of people who were forced to stay in ‘poramboke’ land and another section of kudikidappukar or cultivating tenants.

Mr. Kunjaman was speaking at a debate on journalist R. Sunil’s book Harrisons: Rekhayillatha Janmi (Harrisons: the landlord without documents).

“Development of productive forces was never the aim of land reforms. Also, it was a top-down process, not the other way around,” he pointed out. Land reforms were implemented by the former landlords at a time when social control changed hands from feudal lords to political lords. “The then Communist Party of India had come up with the slogan ‘land for the tiller’ in 1955. However, after land reforms, land ownership was given to the tenants and many landlords did not lose their hold over land,” he said.

Land for farmers

Mr. Kunjaman pointed out that neither landless wage labourer became landowner nor land-holding feudal lords became land-owning farmers. “Some of those who got land were businessmen, political leaders and college professors. They were not engaged in agriculture. As B.R. Ambedkar suggested, the land should have gone to those involved in farming,” he said.

Mr. Kunjaman alleged that the spokespersons of land reforms were using their clout to spread their version of the story. “Actually, development happened in Kerala because of the Gulf boom after which the expatriates invested heavily on land. However, it did not led to any increase in productivity,” he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/36jdq/article30618779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21KIECONOMIST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/untruths-half-truths-being-spread-about-land-reforms/article30618780.ece

He was inaugurating a 12-hour hunger strike led by Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) leader M.K. Muneer against the CAA on Kozhikode beach on Tuesday. “The resolution passed in the State Assembly demanding the scrapping of the controversial CAA should reflect in the policy address,” said Mr. Chennithala.

The policy address, the Congress leader said, should clarify the strong sentiments of the people of Kerala against the CAA. “Confusion still existed over Census and National Population Register (NPR). The deletion of two newly introduced questions in the Census will not allay the fears. The Census should not be carried out in a hasty manner. The government should act cautiously in this regard,” he said.

Mr. Chennithala said the BJP-led Government at the Centre was acting in a manner that amounted to challenging the Constitution.

355,2020/01/21,Drivers go on token strike against e-rickshaws,"Alleging that electric rickshaws (e-rickshaw) are being operated without securing permit from local bodies, over 3,000 conventional autorickshaw drivers went on a token strike in Kozhikode city on Monday.

The protesters, who also staged a Satyagraha in front of the KSRTC terminal, claimed that the “unregulated services” had been taking a toll on their income, derailing the taxi operation system.

The strike was total and affected rail passengers mostly. Fearing hostile action from agitators, e-rickshaws too kept off the road. Low-cost online taxi services were of some help for many though they were scanty near railway and bus stations.

In some areas, drivers cancelled even school trips. The coordination committee had directed all trip operators to make the strike a success. Entry of autorickshaws from outside the city was also prevented by protesters.

Meanwhile, the coordination committee held it was not against e-rickshaws, but they should be allowed under a proper city permit system managed by the city corporation or other local bodies. As such, a system is in place for patrol and diesel autorickshaws, and there should be no exemption for new entrants, the committee said.

Committee convener P. Hemanthkumar said traditional drivers should be given enough time to replace their vehicles with electric ones and cooperate with the government in its pollution control initiatives. Besides, they deserve financial support in the form of loans to purchase new vehicles, he added.

At the same time, leaders of a newly formed e-rickshaw drivers’ union alleged that the protesters had been raising baseless demands without studying the revised rules.

357,2020/01/21,"Apprehensions over CAA, NPR hit national sample survey","Apprehensions over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Population Register (NPR) have taken a toll on the ongoing National Sample Survey (NSS) conducted by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation in north Kerala, especially Malappuram district.

The household survey has come under widespread criticism even as several grama panchayats in the Muslim-dominated regions of Malappuram have passed resolutions against all surveys initiated by the Centre.

The ongoing 78th NSS began on January 1, with Minister for Local Self Governments A.C. Moideen launching the programme in Thiruvananthapuram. The survey focuses on domestic tourism expenditure and multiple indicators for sustainable development goals for 2030.

Statistical officers attached to the Field Operations Division and officials of the Department of Economics and Statistics of the State Government are jointly conducting the survey in seven northern districts. “At the launch of the programme, the Minister had appealed to people to cooperate with the survey. Now, we have no choice but to request the Director of Panchayats to convince residents through campaigns,” said Saji George, Director, NSS Regional Office, North Kerala.

Around 35 households in 800 grama panchayats have been selected for collection of visitor characteristics on domestic tourism for preparing the Tourism Satellite Account at the national level. This is being done for the Ministry of Tourism.

Besides, the multiple indicator survey, conducted for the first time as part of NSS, will collect information on migration and construction of houses since 2014-15 for the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. This apart, data will be collected on access to mass media and availability of birth registration certificates. Junior statistical officers collect data on tablets, while State Government representatives carry out the survey in the normal questionnaire paper mode. “The survey has not been stalled, but the opposition to it owing to ignorance has certainly affected data collection. Collection of socio-economic data has been in vogue since 1950. Unless the local authorities allay residents’ fears, it will be difficult for us to complete the task,” Mr. George said.

359,2020/01/21,Kozhikode Corporation to clear misconceptions about non-woven bags,"A large section of people still believe that non-woven carry bags are actually cloth.

And, the Kozhikode Corporation feels that the misconception should be cleared at the earliest if it has to go ahead with the implementation of the ban on single-use plastic.

The corporation health wing began hunting for banned products at shops and other establishments on January 16, and it has seized 510 kg of such products so far. Health Inspector C.K. Valsan, who is in charge of the operation, attested that most of the seized products were ‘non-woven’ carry bags.

“Initially, we had inspected textile showrooms, and many of them were found using non-woven bags, believing they were not plastic,” Mr. Valsan said, adding that even smaller shops were using it. However, the health wing squads found it refreshing that the public had voluntarily shifted to paper and cloth bags to a large extent.

“We found that vendors in vegetable, meat and fish markets have stopped using plastic bags. They have paper cones ready to pack items,” Mr. Valsan said.

The squad seized 340 kg of banned products on day one, 105 on the second day, and 75 on the third day. “Media reports on confiscations are doing a lot of good. Vendors are now trying to get rid of them as far as possible,” he added.

Agencies in demand

Meanwhile, agencies involved in recycling plastic are in great demand among vendors who wish to get rid of their plastic stock. The squad has given a breathing time of 10 more days for small shops to get rid of their stock of single-use plastic, though they cannot sell it any more.

At the same time, compostable plastic has entered the market. The squads have been provided with Dichloromethane solutions to determine if the products available in markets adhered to norms. Mr. Valsan said all tests so far had given positive results.

Notices

360,2020/01/21,Political leaders answerable for clashes during anti-CAA protests,"With protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) resulting in frequent clashes between sympathisers of various political parties, the police have decided to have a tight grip on political leaders who organise such events without adequate preparations to control the crowd.

Station House Officers in the politically-sensitive rural areas of Kozhikode are now considering the scope of organising all-party meetings and holding political leaders accountable for law and order issues during such protests. In one such meeting held at Valayam, political leaders were clearly told that they would be held accountable in case of aggressive behaviour or public nuisance caused by activists during protests. They were also asked to handle the leadership of such protests directly other than just leaving it to the mob participating in the demonstrations.

For the record, a few politically-sensitive areas under the Valayam police station limits had witnessed stormy scenes when anti-CAA protesters were challenged by supporters of the legislation. Activists of various youth organisations were in the forefront of such aggressive protests, which were often overlooked by parent organisations. Vanimel was one such location where youth activists locked horns with CAA supporters. Chekiyad panchayat too had witnessed similar incidents, compelling the police to take strong action.

Valayam Sub Inspector R.C. Biju said an all-party meeting was held last Friday subsequent to a directive from the District Police Chief (Kozhikode Rural). “It drew the participation of all party leaders and people’s representatives. It was the first such meeting held in the Kozhikode rural area, and similar meetings will be convened under all police station limits in the days to come,” he added.

Instructions have also been issued to local police stations to intensify night patrol and keep an eye on provocative night protests in politically-sensitive areas.

protest meetings organised in public places without obtaining prior consent will be actioned on the spot. Also, mediation by political party leaders will be sought to settle political disputes which lead to unexpected clashes.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/political-leaders-answerable-for-clashes-during-anti-caa-protests/article30610659.ece
361,2020/01/21,Demand for speed-breakers on widened road,"Residents of Kannanendal have demanded that the State Highways put up speed breakers on the newly widened Moondrumavadi-Iyer Bungalow, as the speed of vehicles crossing the stretch has increased drastically.

On Tuesday, a speeding cargo vehicle hit a two-wheeler at Kannanendal junction and one of its front wheels climbed up the short parapet constructed on both sides of a Public Works Department channel running in the middle of the road.

The two-wheeler rider was immediately rushed to a hospital with bleeding injuries.

“The cargo vehicle was travelling at high speed and the driver could not control the vehicle,” said a local resident, D. David, 39.

“Before the road was taken up for widening, the road had speed breakers at important junctions. After the widening work was taken up, the speed breakers have not been laid again. With wider roads, drivers tend to speed up, leading to frequent accidents,” he added.

Mr. David also raised concern over the quality of the concrete parapet constructed at the junction.

The entire block of concrete came apart in the impact of the accident.

“It seems no iron rods were used to hold the parapet with the slab covering the channel,” he said.

Mr. David also said that the newly constructed parapet with gaps in between did not ensure safety of the vehicles.

Not only two-wheelers, even a small car could fall into the channel, he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/demand-for-speed-breakers-on-widened-road/article30619192.ece

367,2020/01/21,HC takes up custodial death case suo motu,"The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday initiated suo motu proceedings in the alleged Avaniapuram custodial death case.

A 22-year-old youth, M. Balamurugan, who sustained injuries in police custody, later died at Government Rajaji Hospital in October last.

The case took a turn when the father of the deceased, P. Muthukaruppan, who had earlier sought a CBI probe into the incident, decided to withdraw his petition.

Advocate Henri Tiphagne, who had represented the petitioner pro bono, wrote to the High Court indicating lacunas in the investigation.

He also alleged that the father had withdrawn the petition because of threat from local police and that the parents were being coerced not to depose against the police officers involved in the incident.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran directed the State to file a counter in the case and adjourned the hearing by four weeks. During the course of the hearing, the State submitted that the investigation in the case was on.

It was said that Balamurugan and his associates were arrested by the police for allegedly kidnapping a youth and demanding money from the youth’s parents.

A case was registered against them. Later, the parents of Balamurugan were informed that their son was admitted to GRH with injuries.

The 22-year-old succumbed to injuries at the hospital. His parents alleged custodial death and moved the High Court Bench seeking a probe into the case.

The court ordered a post-mortem by a senior doctor and also directed that the CCTV footage at the Avaniapuram police station be preserved.

Gnanathiraviam has urged the officials to operate this train from Chennai Egmore instead of Tambaram.

In a memorandum submitted to John Thomas, General Manager, Southern Railway, he said the increase in service from thrice a week to five days a week would be of great help to commuters who could not get tickets in the crowded Kanyakumari and Ananthapuri Express trains. If this train was operated from Egmore instead of Tambaram, it would be easy for commuters from north Chennai, senior citizens, women and children instead of rushing to Tambaram to board the train.

Moreover, a single trip from Nagercoil to Velankanni could be operated using the coaches of this train on Fridays to generate extra revenue, he suggested.

The MP said the Nagercoil – Mumbai Express (train number 16339 / 40 and 16351 / 52) should be upgraded as ‘superfast express’ with LHB coaches and its departure timing from Mumbai should be changed for the convenience of passengers now detraining at Madurai, Sattur, Kovilpatti and Tirunelveli stations at odd hours.

369,2020/01/21,‘Exempt large-size taxis from installation of speed governors’,"MADURAI

A taxi owner moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday seeking a direction to forbear the State from insisting on fixing speed governors in taxis with seating capacity for up to eight plus one passengers and a maximum weight of 3,500 kg.

In his petition, C. Santhosam, president of a Tirunelveli-based taxi owners and drivers welfare association, said that under Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, State governments were empowered to issue notification requiring fitting of speed governors in transport vehicles and setting the maximum speed limit.

All taxis came under the definition of transport vehicles. But, the Tamil Nadu government did not bring out any notification mandating installation of speed governors. In 2015, an amendment to the rules that mandated installation of speed governors in transport vehicles was made, he said.

Certain types of vehicles were exempted from the mandatory installation of speed governors and they included passenger four-wheelers with seating capacity for up to eight plus one passengers and the maximum weight of 3,500 kg.

The petitioner said the State, however, insisted that all taxis be fitted with speed governors. Installation of speed governors in already manufactured vehicles was an illegality as it would tamper with the electronic system of the engines, he said.

Whenever the taxi owners and taxi drivers went to renew fitness certificates for the vehicles, they were being told by the authorities concerned to install speed governors, he said. He also sought a direction to the State to issue fitness certificates to taxis manufactured prior to October 1, 2015.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran directed the State to file a counter in the case and adjourned the hearing by four weeks.

370,2020/01/21,Farmers criticise insurance firm,"A group of farmers staged a dharna in front of an insurance firm here on Tuesday when officials reportedly asked them to come to the office next Monday to submit their new bank account numbers for getting insurance benefits.

Farmers, who had cultivated corn as rain-fed crop in various parts of the district during 2018 – 2019, suffered extensive damage following Fall Armyworm attack. As they had paid the crop insurance premium through the Pandyan Grama Bank (PGB), they were hopeful of getting the insurance benefits. As the PGB became Tamil Nadu Rural Bank following its merger with Pallavan Grama Bank, farmers were asked by the insurance firm to get new account number from the new entity, Tamil Nadu Rural Bank, so that the company could remit the compensation in the new accounts through online fund transfer.

When the farmers after getting the account number from Tamil Nadu Rural Bank went to the insurance firm on Tuesday, they were asked to come to the office next Monday as the linking of new account number with farmers’ names would be done only on Mondays. While a section of the farmers waiting with the new account numbers left the insurance firm premises with murmur, about 50 agriculturists, led by A. Varadharajan, president of Karisal Bhoomi Vivasaayigal Sangam, staged a dharna in front of the office saying that they would continue their agitation until their account numbers were received and linked to their new accounts.

As the protest that started at 8.30 a.m. continued beyond 12.45 p.m., the insurance firm officials received the new account numbers.

“The insurance firm officials say they would get details from 200 persons only on Mondays, which will take at least three months to complete the exercise since more than 10,000 farmers had paid premium through the PGB. As farmers coming from northern parts of the district have to spend at least ₹ 300 per head per trip to Thoothukudi, we staged a protest to achieve our demand,” Mr. Varadharajan said.

He urged the insurance firm officials to ensure error-free linking of new account with their names for prompt and timely disbursal of insurance benefits.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/farmers-criticise-insurance-firm/article30617999.ece

372,2020/01/21,Pilgrims march towards Palani,"Palani witnesses a steady flow of pilgrims for the Thaipoosam festival but some shortcomings should be set right immediately.

Every year, two to four lakh devotees visit the temple town during the festival period and the district administration takes lot of efforts such as provision of drinking water and toilets facilities apart from making elaborate security arrangements including CCTV network and watch towers.

But a major problem that haunts the town is encroachment of platforms. During the festival time, roadside shops come up all along pavements in the town. Even makeshift eateries are set up in a bid to cash in on the rush of pilgrims.

“The municipality should take steps to clear encroachments so that pilgrims can use pavements. It results in congestion of roads in the town. A bunch of traders descend on Palani to put up their wares. They should not be allowed or a separate space has to be earmarked for them to set up shops,” says A. Karuppiah, running a shop near the bus stand.

Besides, pilgrims travel in load vehicles. Though a number of special trains and buses are operated for their benefit, many pilgrims can be seen travelling on goods carrier and tempos. It poses a major threat to their safety.

Motorists say that the police should curb such dangerous travel as it may pave way for accidents.

Apart from giving reflector wrist bands to pilgrims, they should create awareness of dangers of travel in goods vehicles, they add.

Meanwhile, members of the Tamil Nadu Association for the Rights of All Types of Differently-Abled and Caregivers, said that the District Differently-Abled Welfare Officer was not invited for the meeting chaired by the Collector on Monday when discussion regarding preparations for the festival was held.

“We have been submitting a representation to the district administration for many years that steps should be taken to address the needs of differently abled pilgrims. Every year, at least 10,000 disabled people visit the hill temple during the festival time.

Last year, the DDAWO was involved in the meeting. Wheel chairs and ramps were arranged for differently abled pilgrims to take a holy dip in Shanmuganadhi and at prakarams inside the temple,” says Bhagat Singh, district secretary of the association.

Collector M. Vijayalakshmi said the needs of differently abled pilgrims would be taken care of. “All facilities such as wheel-chairs inside and outside the temple complex, ramps at strategic locations and various other assistance will be made available for disabled pilgrims,” she said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/pilgrims-march-towards-palani/article30617797.ece
373,2020/01/21,OPS calls former AIADMK leaders to return to party fold,"AIADMK coordinator and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam on Tuesday said those who left the AIADMK soon after the demise of former Chief Ministers M.G. Ramachandran and Jayalalithaa to lead an “apolitical life in isolation” should return to make the party more vibrant and formidable.

Addressing a function organised to mark the unveiling of the portrait of former Legislative Assembly Speaker P.H. Pandian at Govindaperi, his birthplace, near Cheranmahadevi, Mr. Panneerselvam appealed to former leaders to return to the party fold, and cited the re-entry of former MLA V. Karuppasamy Pandian.

The Deputy Chief Minister said with his thorough legal knowledge Pandian exhibited the “sky-high powers of the Speaker” in the Assembly, and stood like a rock when the party and its governments faced troubled times. He set a trend in the functioning of Speakers across the country. “A fitting monument for P.H. Pandian will be constructed at Govindaperi and I will lead this exercise,” Mr. Panneerselvam said.

Former Minister and deputy coordinator of the AIADMK K.P. Munusamy recalled Pandian’s steadfast loyalty towards party high command whenever the party faced turbulence following the demise of MGR and Jayalalithaa.

“When MGR passed away, Pandian backed V.N. Janaki and played an active role in making her Chief Minister. Though several leaders got permission for starting self-financing engineering colleges during her rule, Pandian desisted from doing that as he was against commercialisation of education. Again, he exhibited uncompromising loyalty towards Jayalalithaa and after her demise, he fearlessly opposed the move made by a family to appropriate the AIADMK,” Mr. Munusamy said.

“If he had compromised his political and ideological stance, he could have got more attractive positions during his career,” Mr. Munusamy said.

Ministers K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji, R.B. Udhayakumar, ‘Kadambur’ C. Raju and V.M. Rajalakshmi, Rajya Sabha MP Vijila Sathyananth, Tamil Nadu Government’s Special Representative in Delhi N. Thalavaisundaram, Bishop of Tirunelveli CSI Diocese Most Rev. Christdoss and MLAs participated.

A record 5.58 lakh people watched jallikattu events held at Palamedu and Alanganallur through Madurai Kavalan app, YouTube channel and Facebook page of Madurai Rural District police.

Madurai Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan said that Madurai Kavalan app received an overwhelming response from jallikattu lovers who watched the events that were held in Palamedu and Alanganallur on January 16 and 17 respectively.

Along with its technical team, the district police had hired private technical personnel to provide the live coverage of jallikattu events. “We had involved some 30 persons for videographing the events with three cameras and for software support. It was a grand success as several lakh people had watched the video promos released by the district police on Madurai Kavalan app on the live video coverage of jallikattu events,” he said.

“The district police roped in film personalities like director Samudrakani and actor Abisaravanan to promote live coverage on Madurai Kavalan app,” the SP said.

Over 1,800 police personnel were deployed at both the venues and traffic policemen regulated vehicle movement at important junctions. Several barricades were put up for safety purpose.

The elaborate safety arrangements made by the district police significantly brought down the number of spectators, tamers and bulls suffering injuries, the SP added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/558-lakh-people-watched-jallikattu-coverage-live-madurai/article30610003.ece

Kotian, Moodbidri MLA, walked out of the Karnataka Development Programme (KDP) meeting presided over by Kota Srinivasa Poojary, Minister in charge of Dakshina Kannada, on Monday seeking action against Shanady Ajith Kumar Hegde, Commissioner, Mangaluru City Corporation.

The MLA accused the Commissioner of speaking to him rudely and insulting him over the phone recently.

The meeting, held after a gap of 16 months, was scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. But it started an hour later as Mr. Poojary arrived late forcing the officials and elected representatives to wait for the Minister.

As Mr. Poojary arrived and apologised for arriving late as he had to attend at programme at Thotta Bengre, Mr. Kotian stood up and alleged that Mr. Hegde insulted him in a matter related to drilling a borewell for drinking water as the existing borewell in Moodushedde gram panchayat limits had been contaminated.

When asked by the Minister, Mr. Hegde denied the charge. Later the Minister instructed the Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh to issue a notice to Mr. Hegde and seek his explanation. At this point the irritated Mr. Kotian, who was not satisfied with the way in which the Minister handled the issue, told him that he would raise the matter in the State Assembly and will move a privilege motion in the Lower House and it was an insult to all the elected representatives and walked out.

Immediately, Mr. Poojary said that the meeting had passed a resolution to write to the government to take disciplinary action against the Commissioner.

Even as BJP MLAs, D. Vedavyasa Kamath, Rajesh Naik, and Mr. Poojary himself remained mute spectators, Ivan D’Souza, MLC from the Congress, expressed concern over the matter raised by Mr. Kotian.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/gha9fk/article30610228.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGKOTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bjp-mla-walks-out-of-kdp-meeting-presided-over-by-kota/article30610229.ece

Ivan D’Souza, MLC, questioned the delay in completing the project on time. Kota Srinivasa Poojary, Minister in charge of Dakshina Kannada, presided over the meeting. Subbarama Holla, Excutive Engineer, Mangaluru Division of the National Highways division under the Public Works Department, told the meeting that the new bridge at Gurupura across the Phalguni will be completed by May.

Mr. D’Souza pointed out that though the bridge could be ready it cannot be put into use unless it was connected to the Mangaluru-Moodbidri highway through approach roads at both ends of the bridge. The land for the same is yet to be acquired. Mr. Holla said that the land is being acquired.

Special Land Acquisition Officer for the NHAI for Mangaluru-Karkala highway widening project told the meeting that the final 3D notification for acquiring land for the project has been issued covering 18 villages under Dakshina Kannada.

Mr. Poojary said that a meeting with the managing director of KRDIL will be held in Mangaluru to decide whether some building works of government degree colleges and PU colleges entrusted to KRDIL should be withdrawn or continued.

381,2020/01/21,ASEAN Secretariat invites India for meeting on RCEP in Bali,"The ASEAN Secretariat has invited India to participate in a meeting called in Bali on February 3 and 4 on RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) agreement to sort out the concerns of New Delhi, an official said.

India at a meeting in November last year in Bangkok decided to withdraw from the mega free-trade agreement as its concerns were not addressed adequately by the RCEP. “India has received the invitation for the meeting but it has not yet taken any decision on this,” the official said.

The RCEP, comprising the 10-member ASEAN bloc and six other countries — India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, is engaged in negotiations for a free-trade pact. Japan had earlier indicated that efforts were on to make India join the ambitious Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), saying all member countries of the grouping were committed to address New Delhi’s concerns.

Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue earlier in the month, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said India had not closed its doors on the RCEP and would carry out a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate its merit. “Where the RCEP is concerned, we have to look at cost and benefit. We will evaluate its economic and trade merit. We have not closed our mind to it,” he said.

The presence of China in the RCEP grouping had raised concerns as the Indian industry fears that the free-trade pact would result in flooding of Chinese goods in the domestic market. Several sectors such as IT and pharma have time and again flagged the issue of trade barriers which prevented entry of domestic players in the Chinese market.

India has pitched for an auto-trigger mechanism in the RCEP agreement as a remedy against sudden and significant import surge from countries such as China to protect domestic players. India registered a trade deficit in 2018-19 with as many as 11 RCEP member countries including China, South Korea and Australia.

The agreement has aimed to cover issues related to goods, services, investments, economic and technical cooperation, competition and intellectual property rights. In such trade agreements, trading partners reduce or eliminate customs duties on maximum number of goods traded among themselves. They also relax norms like visa regime to promote trade in services and attract investments.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/b31t0c/article30616790.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17thHarsh-PantG7K2S8I8L4jpgjpg-21jan,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/asean-secretariat-invites-india-for-meeting-on-rcep-in-bali/article30616753.ece

Speaking in Davos at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2020, the Commerce and Industry Minister also called for greater cooperation among various nations to realise the huge growth prospects in the Indian Ocean region and also for tackling the important issue of climate change.

Mr. Goyal said the RCEP in its present form was clearly an unworkable agreement.

“Any pact needs to take into account several factors. India is grappling with a huge trade deficit, particularly with China and many other nations in the region,” he said.

For the first time, India demonstrated that trade cannot be dictated by diplomacy, Mr. Goyal said, referring to India’s decision to pull out of the RCEP.

The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has had to factor in several diversities among partners, but India has serious concerns about climate change and is seeking greater cooperation on fair terms, he asserted.

Mr. Goyal was speaking at a Strategic Outlook session on ‘The Indian Ocean Rim’.

“We are like a pivot for the Indian Ocean and we believe this region has huge potential. At the same time, India is very much concerned about the issue of climate change.

“Going forward, the entire grouping around the Indian Ocean will play a very important role, while keeping in mind fair and equitable distribution. India also expects greater cooperation among various nations on climate change,” he said.

Mr. Goyal further said, “We in India are also working on how to put in place more equitable terms in our trade relations with various countries.”

The Indian Ocean Rim sees two-thirds of the world’s oil shipments pass through its waters and is home to half of the world’s container ships that support 2.7 billion people.

The American dream is back and it’s better than ever and there is no one better than the American middle class today, Mr. Trump said.

In a special address at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit, he said since he last addressed Davos two years ago, the U.S. has enjoyed the “great American comeback” that he had predicted.

“India’s GDP growth weakened to its slowest rate in five years in the fiscal year ended March 2019, and the resultant financial pressure on rural households amid weaker job creation is in turn also weighing on premium growth,” says Benjamin Serra, a Moody’s Senior vice-president.

GDP growth slowed to 6.8% in fiscal 2018 and could slow further to 4.9% in fiscal 2019 before recovering to 6.3% in fiscal 2020, the rating agency said.

“Nevertheless, the country’s low insurance penetration rate suggests ample room for further growth, while supportive government and regulatory initiatives are also helping mitigate the currently challenging environment for Indian insurance and reinsurance companies,” the report said.

Health premiums in particular are likely to increase as a result of the Ayushman Bharat initiative the rating agency said.

In addition, the insurance regulator has put in place a series of measures, including the removal of the limit on foreign ownership stakes in Indian insurance intermediaries, which will strengthen distribution capabilities.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/7rrv89/article30615260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOODYS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-slowing-economy-weighs-on-insurance-premium-growth-says-moodys/article30615261.ece

In a series of tweets, Mr. Chidambaram also claimed that he will not be surprised if the actual growth was even lower as the growth figure of 4.8% given by the IMF is after some “window dressing”.

“Reality check from IMF. Growth in 2019-20 will be BELOW 5% at 4.8%. Even the 4.8 per cent is after some window dressing. I will not be surprised if it goes even lower,” he tweeted.

386,2020/01/21,Uber sells Indian Eats business to Zomato in move to cut losses,"Uber has sold its loss-making online food-ordering business in India to local rival Zomato in exchange for a 9.99% stake in the startup backed by China's Ant Financial.

Since launching in India in 2017, Uber Eats has struggled to gain market share and is a distant third to Tencent Holdings backed Swiggy and Zomato. All three have spent heavily on deals and discounts to attract customers in a highly competitive market.

The deal will allow San Francisco-based Uber to cut its losses and yet keep a stake in a market expected to be worth $15 billion by 2023.

“For Uber, the deal means redefining competence,” independent brand consultant Harish Bijoor said. “It should stick to what its competence is, in terms of being an aggregator of cabs.”

Uber Eats' India operations contributed just 3% of gross bookings for the business globally, while accounting for a quarter of its adjusted operating losses, Uber said. It did not say how much those losses were or disclose financial details of the deal.

Zomato, valued at around $3 billion after raising money from Ant this month, reported a loss of $294 million for the year ended March 2019. Swiggy made a loss of $330 million.

Uber, which has promised to be profitable at an operational level by the end of 2021, has been trying to sell the India Eats business for a year, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.

It earlier held talks with Swiggy for a similar deal but those fell through due to valuation and regulatory issues, two of them said.

Uber and Swiggy did not respond to requests for comment.

Zomato said in a blogpost buying the Eats operations would make it “the undisputed market leaders in the food delivery category in India”.

Uber Eats in India will discontinue operations and direct restaurants, delivery partners and users to the Zomato platform from Tuesday.

Zomato's orders per month should go up by 10 million from the 38 million-40 million it was clocking before the deal, a source familiar with the deal said.

Still, the acquisition doesn't guarantee that all Uber Eats customers will switch to Zomato. Online food delivery customers tend to favour companies offering the best deals, market research shows.

Uber Eats, which pulled out of South Korea earlier this year, said it will continue to operate in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

391,2020/01/21,The great Indian citizenship mess,"On January 22, the Supreme Court will hear 60-plus petitions challenging the constitutionality of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). As a matter of fact, it is the apex court that is largely responsible for the current mess. Its Sarbananda Sonowal judgment (2005), which struck down the Assam-specific Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act (IMDT), was the turning point of the debate on ‘illegal migrants’. Some observations made in the ruling bordered on the xenophobic and were filled with paranoia about ‘outsiders’. Now, some of these ‘outsiders’ will become beneficiaries if the court does not rule against the CAA.

In the Sonowal judgment (2005), the Supreme Court struck down the Assam-specific Act that had put the burden of proof on the state rather than on the person alleged to be a foreigner. Without providing any evidence, the court went on to say that “unabated influx of illegal migrants from Bangladesh into Assam [had] led to a perceptible change in the demographic pattern of the State and reduced the Assamese people to a minority in their own State.” The National Register of Citizens (NRC), monitored by the Supreme Court itself, has proved these fears to be exaggerated. Even if all the 19 lakh excluded people are considered ‘illegal migrants’, their composition as a proportion of Assam’s population is just 4%.

CAA is territory-specific

The CAA, just like the IMDT that was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, is territory-specific and exempts certain Northeastern States from its scope. The IMDT had created a separate regime for the determination of citizenship for Assam while a different regime would operate for the rest of India. The court in the Sonowal verdict had said that such geographical differentiation is admissible only if it has a rational nexus with the Act’s objective. The court also ruled that the IMDT’s objective, to reduce illegal immigration, was not served by enacting such a criterion for Assam alone, and hence the Act violated Article 14. It can be argued that in the case of the CAA also, the geographic differentiation — exclusion of Inner Line Permit States/areas from its ambit — has no nexus with the overall objective of the Act, i.e., helping persecuted people. This makes the Act fall short of the criterion laid down in the Sonowal case.

The court had then said that the territory-agnostic Foreigners Act was far more effective than the IMDT in the identification and exclusion of foreigners who had entered India illegally and had no authority to remain. It needs to be stated here that the Foreigners Act deals with ‘foreigners’, not with those whose names may have been excluded due to lack of documentation, for instance in the Assam NRC. Many of them could indeed be ‘citizens’. We must create separate citizenship tribunals under the Citizenship Act to examine such cases, placing the burden of proof on the state to justify their exclusion. A denial of citizenship, which is a ‘right to rights’, must be through a process that fair, reasonable, just and non-arbitrary. Foreigners’ tribunals are nothing but kangaroo courts.

It also becomes pertinent here to examine different types of awarding citizenship and the history of India’s Citizenship legislation. Citizenship by birth, or jus soli, embraces all those who identify with a country. In contrast, jus sanguinis, citizenship based solely on descent, recognises that some races or ethnicities as ‘national’ and others are ‘outsiders’.

In postcolonial nations, such citizenship laws have provided grounds to render whole populations without rights and produced a constant stream of refugees into neighbouring countries. Myanmar’s 1982 Citizenship Act was one such example that classified only some ethnicities as ‘national’, effectively outlawing the Rohingya people. While jus sanguinis is premised on a country harking back to an arbitrarily-determined past, jus soli looks at the future, enabling a country create a pluralistic and inclusive society.

Citizenship by birth and descent

While discussing citizenship in the Constituent Assembly (CA), the drafters were very conscious of how they wanted to build the India of their dreams. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, now an icon for the Narendra Modi regime, rejected citizenship based on racial principle. His enlightened views, and those of the other CA members, were reflected in the Citizenship Act of 1955 which provided for citizenship by birth. This changed in 1987 when, for the first time, India made jus sanguinis applicable after the then-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi buckled under pressure from Assamese nationalists and signed the Assam Accord.

The Accord created a framework-graded citizenship, depending on a person’s parentage and when he/she had migrated to India. The constitutionality of Section 6A of the Act, which reflects the provisions of the Accord, is still pending before a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court. Ideally, the court should have disposed off this petition before insisting on an Assam NRC.

The Assam Accord and the Sonowal verdict laid the grounds for the Supreme Court-directed NRC. Now, when the CAA has made the inclusion of NRC-excluded migrants belonging to certain communities possible, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who was the petitioner in the 2005 case, has himself expressed doubts about the final list. He has also assured the Assamese people that their culture and language will be preserved. None of the 19 lakh excluded people have been issued orders that would enable them to appeal to a Foreigners’ Tribunal. Interestingly, the apex court had said nothing about the process after its conclusion.

There is little doubt that the Assam Accord implicitly targeted Bengalis in general and Muslims in particular. The CAA has made this discrimination more explicit by offering citizenship to persecuted minorities from certain communities who came from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh before a specified date. It is obvious that the Act intends to exclude Muslims, including those of persecuted religious denominations from these nations. To make a related point, the CAA could possibly also enable people to convert to one of the listed faiths and seek citizenship. They could well say that they adopted Muslim names due to a well-founded fear of persecution in these countries.

The CAA, in essence, not only violates the constitutional values of secularism and freedom of religion, but also negates the principle of equal protection and non-discrimination.

Finally, if the purpose of the CAA is to preserve the spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (‘The world is one family’), why does the government not enact a comprehensive refugee law that would provide for a fair and objective procedure to determine ‘persecution’ and allow eligible refugees to seek asylum? By conflating asylum with citizenship, the CAA sadly prioritises politics over persecuted people.

392,2020/01/21,"Policing, a Delhi election issue","As political parties gear up for Assembly elections in New Delhi, they must accept that a central issue is that of violence in the city and the role of the police in relation to it. This may seem an odd suggestion as the problems faced by Delhi's people are many and diverse. For instance, as the capital of a country that seeks to take its rightful place in world affairs, it is a setback to have diplomats speak of the toxic air as a discouragement to being posted there. In any case, the threat to life of its citizens posed by pollution is so great that privileging the role of the police as an election issue may appear quixotic. Two recent events in the city suggest otherwise.

In December the students of Jamia MiIlia Islamia publicly protested against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). This was met with an unusual response from the police. The media reported eyewitness accounts of police entering the university’s library and bludgeoning students. Not even the arson that took place in Delhi at the time could have justified the indiscriminate violence against members of a university going about their business.

Complicity by inaction

Within three weeks, there took place another act of violence against students in a university, though not by the police. Masked hoodlums entered the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)’s campus and attacked students and staff in a targeted way. The pattern of the attacks suggested strongly that it was carried out by right-wing forces opposed to left-wing politics at JNU.

The Delhi police, we are told, stood by outside the gates of the campus while a club-wielding mob prowled about the campus for several hours. If the University’s extensive security apparatus was unable to quell the violence, it ought to have called in the police. There is an allegation that the police was complicit in the attack. Partisan conduct by the police in India is by no means confined to the Delhi police, nor are their attacks on students of recent origin. However, while in the mob attacks on Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 and against Muslims in Gujarat in 2002, the police had allegedly only been complicit in the violence, in the protests following the CAA they may have taken the law into their own hands. Thus, from the pressure exerted on students and faculty of the IIM-Ahmedabad to not protest on their campus to entering a hospital treating those injured by gunfire in Mangaluru, everything points to predetermined police action in turning on the opponents of the regime.

However, it is in Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) that the role of the police is the most disturbing. The death toll from police firing is over 20. Following this, FIRs were registered against persons for damage to public property. Destruction may well have happened. However, those implicated have publicly denied that they have had anything to do with the protests. Ironically, the list of people against whom FIRs were filed includes a retired policeman and a rickshaw-puller. Gujarat, Karnataka and U.P. have Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) governments.

In Delhi, the police are not answerable to the State government but to the Union Home Ministry, also currently under the BJP. Nevertheless, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has a responsibility to investigate the violence at Jamia and JNU as it took place under its watch. The BJP and the AAP are also the main protagonists in the upcoming elections.

Events that take place in Delhi resonate across the country disproportionately. So, the agenda in the State’s elections may be expected to make an impression elsewhere in India. With two instances of staged violence in close succession, the role of the police in them needs scrutiny. We are a democracy, and elections are an appraisal of how we are governed.

393,2020/01/21,"Guaranteeing healthcare, the Brazilian way","As Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro visits New Delhi this Republic Day, one interesting field of cooperation to explore in the strategic partnership is healthcare. Achieving universal health coverage is a very complex task, especially for developing countries. Here, the example of Brazil, the only country where more than 100 million inhabitants have a universal health system, is worth studying. It can also provide lessons for Ayushman Bharat, currently the world’s largest and most ambitious government health programme.

Following the end of military rule, the Brazilian society decided to achieve universal coverage by establishing a government-funded system. The Unified Health System (SUS), which guaranteed free health coverage that included pharmaceutical services, was written into the new Constitution in 1988.

Progress over 30 years

In the last 30 years, Brazilians have experienced a drastic increase in health coverage as well as outcomes: life expectancy has increased from 64 years to almost 76 years, while Infant Mortality Rate has declined from 53 to 14 per 1,000 live births. In terms of service provision, polio vaccination has reached 98% of the population. A 2015 report said that 95% of those that seek care in the SUS are able to receive treatment. Every year, the SUS covers more than two million births, 10 million hospital admissions, and nearly one billion ambulatory procedures.

This has been made possible even amidst a scenario of tightening budget allocation. While universal health systems tend to consume around 8% of the GDP — the NHS, for instance, takes up 7.9% of Britain’s GDP — Brazil spends only 3.8% of its GDP on the SUS, serving a population three times larger than that of the U.K. The cost of the universal health system in Brazil averages around $600 per person, while in the U.K., this number reaches $3.428.

A study conducted by the Brazil-based Institute for Health Policy Studies (IEPS) forecasts that public health spending in Brazil will need to increase by nearly 1.6 percentage points of the GDP by 2060 in order to cover the healthcare needs of a fast-ageing society.

Achieving universal coverage in India, a country with a population of 1.3 billion, is a challenge of epic proportions. Hence, the advances in this field should be seen not in binaries but judged by its steady growth and improvement. For instance, India must record details of improvement in terms of access, production and population health on a year-by-year basis. A starting point for this daunting task is funding. Public health expenditure is still very low in India, at around 1.3% of GDP in the 2017-2018 fiscal year.

Establishing wellness centres

The Brazilian experience can also inform the design of the expansion of primary care that underlies Ayushman Bharat, that is, the creation of 1,50,000 wellness centre by 2022. The Family Health Programme (Programa Saúde da Família), which relies on a community-based healthcare network, is the backbone of the rapid expansion of coverage in Brazil. The strategy is based on an extensive work of community health agents who perform monthly visits to every family enrolled in the programme.

These agents carry out a variety of tasks. They conduct health promotion and prevention activities, oversee whether family members are complying with any treatment they might be receiving, and effectively manage the relationship between citizens and the healthcare system. The strategy works: a large body of research shows that the programme has drastically reduced IMR and increased adult labour supply. Equally impressive has been its expansion, from 4% of coverage in 2000 to up to 64% of the overall population in 2015; it was able to reach even the rural areas and the poorest States of the country.

Both Brazil and India are composed of large States with a reasonable degree of administrative autonomy. This fact implies great challenges and opportunities. The major challenge is that a one-size-fits-all approach for such heterogeneous regional realities is inconceivable: Tamil Nadu, Sikkim, and Bihar differ in so many ways and this diversity must be met by an intricate combination of standardised programmes and autonomy to adopt policies according to their characteristics. Moreover, regional disparities in terms of resources and institutional capabilities must be addressed. This diversity, nevertheless, can be a powerful source of policy innovation and creativity.

394,2020/01/21,Deciphering the moves on Russia’s power chessboard,"Just as the countdown to the end of Russia’s Vladimir Putin’s presidential term draws close, he has announced major changes in three directions: constitutional changes; reshuffling his close aides and policy makers; a slew of economic and social measures that will impact Russian economy and society. What are these changes and what do they say about Mr. Putin’s plans for the Russian state and himself as its central figure?

These changes came in last week when Mr. Putin addressed a joint session of both houses of Parliament. The powerful Russian security council has been given a new deputy chairmanship — the chair is the president. This constitutional change is linked to the reshuffle of the men around him. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Mr. Putin’s closest aide has been shifted to this newly created post. This constitutional change has to be introduced into the Duma and signed by the President. It is clear this will be done post-facto and seamlessly since the Duma is under Mr. Putin’s control and his party has the majority.

Mr. Medvedev’s successor is Mikhail Mishustin, 53, who worked as the head of Russia’s Federal Tax Service, a largely “behind the scenes” technocrat, barely recognisable by the Russian public. It has also been stated that more cabinet changes are likely to follow.

The Medvedev factor

Clearly, the constitutional change to the Security Council has been made to accommodate Mr. Medvedev, who has, since the early 1990s, worked as a close aide to Mr. Putin. In fact since the Russian Constitution had stipulated that the Russian President could serve only two consecutive terms, Mr. Medvedev was installed as President between 2008-2012 and Mr. Putin became Prime Minister. It was more than evident that not only did Mr. Medvedev keep the seat warm till he was replaced by Mr. Putin in 2012, he also did not take any decision himself, ruling by proxy for Mr. Putin. Then Mr. Medvedev again became the Prime Minister from 2012 until last week.

The question is whether Mr. Medvedev has been given an honourable exit by making him Deputy Chair of the Security Council and who Mr. Putin is grooming in a succession game, if at all, when the Putin term draws to a close. But given Mr. Putin’s power and control, he keeps his moves close to his chest.

The other constitutional changes are also significant. Mr. Putin has proposed that the Russian legislature, the Duma, actually get more powers. For example, the Duma will now approve the appointment of the Prime Minister, and the President’s Deputies and cabinet Ministers.

In the original Constitution the President alone nominated them. Now the Duma will have the power to endorse or reject the President’s choice. However the President retains the right to suggest the names and dismiss them.

Further, the newly proposed changes also empower the State Council. The State Council worked as an assembly of Governors from federal states which met irregularly with primarily consultative powers. This body now gets constitutional status. Even as Mr. Putin announced a non-binding plebiscite on these changes, the Russian political system remains a highly centralised presidential one.

Gameplan till 2024

Clearly, Mr. Putin continues to hold full control. But he is also making his legacy as a builder of constitutional institutions; by giving the Duma more powers, Mr. Putin signifies that he is moving to empower this body.

Mr. Putin also addressed the major internal security threat: the severe and continuous demographic decline (almost one million less every year). He has called the low birthrate and high mortality as unacceptable. To address demographic decline but also the stagnating Russian economy, Mr. Putin announced measures that include: All low income families with children under age seven will receive monthly cash handouts. All children till grade four in all Russian schools will get free lunch. All mothers after the birth of their first or second child will receive benefits and payments.

Besides these handouts, he announced public spending and infrastructure projects to address poverty, decrease social tensions, reduce income gaps, improve health. This will add up to 450 billion rubles ($7.5 billion) per year in terms of public spending in Russia’s yearly budget. This could stimulate the economy, address the demographic crises and kickstart the stagnation in the economy. At a time of worldwide austerity and cut in social expenditures, Mr. Putin is going against the tide. The Russian people support these measures.

So what do all these changes add up to? Some would argue that Mr. Putin’s thirst for retaining control over the Russian Federation is not lessening. However, there appears to be a mixed bag. He continues with his project of strengthening the Russian state. This is what he began his career with, when he took control of a dissipating state after the Yeltsin period. He has been rightly critiqued for not building autonomous institutions, not considering a separation of powers, retaining a centralised federal system, controlling the press and promoting crony capitalist clique. But Mr. Putin and Russia also face external challenges. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the West see Russia as a major military threat and so Russia has to continue with a huge military industrial complex. Russia has sanctions against it. Mr. Putin has had to weave relations with states that are willing to ignore these sanctions. Russia’s core interests in west and central Asia as also in the east with China, India and others have to be balanced. So Mr. Putin has had to work around these issues.

The truth is that while opposition and criticism has demonised Mr. Putin, he remains in control and has popular support. At a time of right-wing populisms holding power and increasing control of institutions the world over, and at a time of declining multilateralism and new threats, Mr. Putin and Russia refuse to lie down and be walked over. The word for describing Mr. Putin could be populist authoritarian. Since Mr. Putin rejects liberalism and does not have much time for procedural democracy, he would not object to this description. In this Russian chessboard, Mr. Putin plays the queen.

395,2020/01/21,Stay put: on Vladimir Putin's Cabinet reshuffle,"Russian President Vladimir Putin’s government reshuffle is the latest phase of a calculated transition strategy aimed at his political relevance beyond 2024, when he demits office. The overhaul, detailed in his recent state of the nation address, includes sweeping constitutional changes, which he said would be put to a referendum. Most significant is perhaps a two-term limit for future Presidents. Mr. Putin is currently serving his fourth. A 2008 manoeuvre, when the former KGB officer, at the end of a second successive term swapped the presidency with Dmitry Medvedev, installing himself Prime Minister for the next four years, caused outrage. A third term from 2013, was after an amendment to extend presidential terms to six years. There was a hint of the new revamp at a press conference in December, when Mr. Putin also pointed to a woman’s eligibility for the country’s highest office. Other changes include the expansion of the powers of Parliament and Prime Minister, besides strengthening the State Council. Speculation is rife that Mr. Putin could head the latter body, in a role similar in importance to Kazakhstan’s former President Nazarbayev, who stepped down in 2019 after a 30-year rule.

Mr. Medvedev, and also the entire cabinet, who resigned soon after the address, is now deputy of the Kremlin’s newly created security council. The staunch Putin ally has been replaced as premier by Mikhail Mishustin, Russia’s highly regarded head of taxation, but with little political experience. The nomination has occasioned comparisons with past government overhauls. Mr. Medvedev was one prominent Putin associate who survived the changes effected after the President’s 2018 re-election, when many long-time appointees made way for younger loyalists. The poll itself was criticised as a charade, as prominent Opposition candidate Alexei Navalny was earlier barred from the contest. The slant of Mr. Putin’s proposals is in sync with his political stance, for instance in his public comments last year that liberalism had outlived its utility. Moscow’s Syrian military intervention has bolstered its influence across West Asia. Similarly, the aggression in Ukraine and Georgia may have restored some of Russia’s lost authority following the Soviet Union’s disintegration. Mr. Putin has, perhaps not without justification, ascribed Russian expansionism as the appropriate response to the extension of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, beyond the former Eastern Bloc, to the erstwhile states of the Soviet Union. At home however, a persistent economic crunch has led his poll ratings to plummet. Paradoxically though, Mr. Putin is the only leader of any consequence a whole new generation of Russians has known. Therefore, despite the frequent protests against repressive policies and high prices, it may be premature to write him off.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stay-put/article30609565.ece
396,2020/01/21,Tragic trek: on unauthorised expeditions,"Venturing into forests for a trek without certified guides is akin to walking into a death trap with one’s eyes closed. Many cases of trekkers being fatally attacked by wild animals, often elephants, and other accidents such as falling off cliffs in the Western and Eastern Ghats bear testimony to this. In the latest incident, on Sunday, a 40-year-old woman, who reportedly went trekking in a reserve forest in Coimbatore, with her husband and friends, was trampled by an elephant. In 2018, 23 people, most of them youngsters, perished in a forest fire while on an unauthorised expedition in south Tamil Nadu’s Kurangani hills. The hike was organised by a private trekking club without Forest Department permission. There have been numerous instances of lost trekkers being eventually rescued by forest personnel or locals. Not all are fortunate though. In 2014, a budding Tamil film art director vanished while on an unauthorised trek in Coimbatore’s Vellingiri hills. Far from being sensitised by these tragedies about the dangers of unfamiliar terrain and wild animals, trekkers continue to put themselves in harm’s way.

To an extent, ignorance of laws governing forest entry contributes to this. Private adventure clubs, most of them online entities, continue to entice youngsters by promising an adventurous experience in the wild. They conceal information on whether they are authorised to conduct such expeditions. In the wake of the Kurangani tragedy, the Tamil Nadu government made it mandatory for trekkers to apply for permission from the competent authority to trek on a linear route in reserve forests, and by paying a fee. Many States also promote eco-tourism by conducting organised treks along safe designated routes and escorted by persons familiar with the terrain. Such treks follow a certain rule of thumb prescribing the right clothing and footwear, highlighting the need to be inconspicuous, and maintaining a safe distance from wildlife. There is a need to publicise trekking rules and also the availability of State-run eco-tourism projects so that nature and adventure enthusiasts are not misled by touts. Using technology, the Forest Department must strengthen its surveillance mechanism to prevent the illegal entry of trekkers. As the Atulya Misra Committee, which probed the Kurangani fire tragedy, recommended, the government must fund acquisition of more unmanned, high-technology aerial vehicles, which would aid the Forest Department that is short on manpower. Laws need to be tightened to deal with violators, who are now merely fined for trespassing into reserve forests. The authorities must also monitor advertisements by private adventure clubs, both offline and online, to ensure they do not conduct unauthorised treks.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tragic-trek/article30609564.ece
397,2020/01/21,"Police detain, then release ‘illegal immigrants’","As the controversy over the demolition and eviction of over a 100 makeshift houses in Kariyammana Agrahara raged, the Marathahalli police, on Monday night and Tuesday, detained a few people from Munnekolala village, alleging that they were illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. They were later released.

This came soon after the eviction drive, which was also aimed at alleged Bangladeshi nationals. Both the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and the police have denied direct involvement with the drive.

Akmal Pasha from the Alternative Law Forum, who rushed to Marathahalli police station to rescue the detainees, said that some labourers were detained by the police while they were unloading goods in the night. He said that one of the detainees is a Kannadiga.

M.N. Anucheth admitted later that those who were detained on Monday night were released on Tuesday as they had valid documents.

However, Basawa Prasad, advocate from Alternative Law Forum, accused the police of prejudice. “When we tried to help the people detained on Monday night, a few of their neighbours came along with us. When we said they were Indians, police asked us to make those accompanying us sing the national anthem,” he alleged.

Original documents amidst rubble

Back in Kariyammana Agrahara where the eviction drive rendered several homeless, people showed original ID proof of those who had lost their homes. The documents found amidst the debris included PAN cards, Aadhaar cards and marks cards of secondary schooling. Most of them belonged to people from West Bengal and North-eastern States.

Neighbours and activists say that no Bangladeshis were residing in the dwellings that were demolished. When The Hindu visited the spot, many families were trying to salvage what was left of their belongings.

Those from north Karnataka also lost their homes. Nagappa from Raichur works as a housekeeper in a building nearby. He told The Hindu that the officials were ‘blind and deaf’ to their requests to spare their houses. “Isn’t Raichur in India? Tens of labourers from north Karnataka also have lost their dwellings,” he said.

Official repatriated

BBMP Special Commissioner D. Randeep, who is in charge of Mahadevapura zone, told The Hindu that the civic body had repatriated the official concerned to the parent department with the recommendation of an inquiry and suspension with immediate effect.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar denied any administrative lapse by the civic body. “This is a case where an officer who is not authorised to act has taken the action. We have written in detail to the parent department regarding this. The officer, without any solid backing or written complaint, did this,” he said.

398,2020/01/21,COP warns food delivery companies of legal action if staff is involved in traffic violations,"Moved by the plight of delivery boys involved in traffic violations and getting injured in their bid to meet deadlines, Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao on Tuesday warned food delivery companies, such as Swiggy, of legal action in case of any eventuality.

On Tuesday morning, he tweeted from his personal account about the plight of delivery boys: ""Do we have the heart to get a free pizza from a kid who is risking his life just because he crossed over 30 mns. Am seriously considering asking Pizza companies to make it 40 minutes as these kids risk their lives by breaking all Traffic rules.""

The post garnered close to 20,000 ‘likes’ and nearly 5,000 retweets.

Some of the responses:

“This 30mins or Free is absolutely not worth anyone risking their lives. The time limit should be removed completely & immediately. Let it be delivery within reasonable time no fixed limit.” @rose_k01

“May i suggest charging the food delivery companies to be charged & indicted for traffic violations of their delivery boys while on duty. They are the ones who don't feel the pain of the gain they make.”

@TweetStreet247

“Ask pizza cmpys to find other ways to keep pizza hot (will need some investment from their side) rather than promising to deliver in 30 mins risking not just delivery boys life but others lives on the road too.”

@deepolice12

What Swiggy said

Swiggy responded to the tweet: ""Hi there, we understand your concern. We do not condone traffic violations of any nature. If you witness the same, please highlight it to us by contacting us at 080-46866699. Have a good day ahead.”

Taking strong exception to the response, Mr. Rao wrote back with a warning that the police may penalise riders for speeding, rash driving, jumping signals, riding without helmet, riding on footpath or parking in 'no-parking' zones. “Your boys beg cops to let them go as you penalise them. Next time a Swiggy kid bleeds on road, be sure, your management will be behind bars,"" he said in his tweet.

A senior police officer told The Hindu that a majority of traffic violations were reported from delivery boys in a bid to meet deadlines. “They often end up injuring themselves and beg the police not to book them. The company slaps a fine on them and deducts money from their meagre salaries if they deliver the order after 30 minutes. It is a sad state of affairs as both the companies and customers are ruthless on the delivery boys,” the officer added.

Swiggy, in a statement, said: As a safety-focused organisation, the safety of our delivery partners and the public is of utmost importance to Swiggy. We actively promote the adherence of traffic rules amongst our delivery partners and do not rate or penalise them for late deliveries. Delivery partners are consistently sensitised on safe riding practices, safety gear and parking etiquette. We also initiate necessary action against those found guilty of violating traffic rules, including termination of services. With the help of superior technology to predict realistic delivery timelines and route optimisation along with the largest delivery fleet in the country, Swiggy is able to maintain a reliable and seamless delivery experience both for consumers and our delivery partners. As part of our ‘Safety First’ initiative introduced last year, delivery partners undergo training on the various nuances of road safety including guidelines to ensure safer riding experience, emergency management, accident response, safety for self and emergency victims and cardio-pulmonary resuscitation techniques.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cop-warns-food-delivery-companies-of-legal-action-if-staff-is-involved-in-traffic-violations/article30618709.ece

400,2020/01/21,Police detain three Bangladeshi migrants in Bengaluru,"The Bengaluru police on Tuesday arrested three persons of a family, who they say are Bangladeshi immigrants, at Munnekolala village near Whitefield in southeast Bengaluru.

However, accusing the police of prejudicial action, Basawa Prasad, advocate from Alternative Law Forum, said, “When we rushed to the rescue of the detainees on Monday night, a few of their neighbours came with us. There a few police personnel asked why we were supporting them. When we said they were Indians, they asked us to make those accompanying us sing the National Anthem.” He said he tried to explain to the police that singing the national anthem was not a criteria to decide on ones citizenship.

Bellandur demolitions

This incident comes two days after around 150 hutments on private land were demolished by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), in the adjoining locality, Kariyammana Agrahara near Bellandur in South East part of the City in a sudden move.

Interestingly, agencies involved in the evacuation drive refused to take ownership of the act. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), city’s civic body, had written to the city police seeking security during the drive, which was provided by the police. The police said that they received a letter from the Assistant Executive Engineer (AEE) after which the demolition was taken up and they had no further role to play.

In its letter to the police, the BBMP alleged that illegal Bangaldeshi immigrants were staying there and converting the place into a slum and that they had received oral complaints by the neighbours.

Speaking to The Hindu, B.H. Anil Kumar, BBMP Commissioner, said that BBMP officer who conducted the drive was not authorised to do it and had conducted the drive without proper documents or written complaints. “The officer responsible for the drive has been repatriated to the home department. We have also written to the department to suspend the officer immediately and conduct an enquiry,” he said.

From West Bengal and Tripura

However, activists say that there were no Bangladeshis residing in the sheds demolished and that many were from West Bengal and Tripura. When The Hindu visited the spot, many families were trying to salvage whatever was left of their belongings. Many labourers who have lost homes are also from the northern districts of Karnataka.

Nagappa, who hails from Raichur in North Karnataka and works as a house keeper in a building nearby, said that the official were completely “blind and deaf” to their request not conduct the drive. “Isn’t Raichur in India?” he asked. “There are tens of labourers from North Karnataka also who have lost their tents,” he said, and added that most of those in his neighbourhood who are dubbed “Bangladeshis” were from West Bengal and Tripura.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/9mjxro/article30619530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bangla-immigrantsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-arrest-three-bangladeshi-immigrants/article30618618.ece
401,2020/01/21,"PhD seats: BU reduces eligibility criteria for SC, ST, OBC candidates","Bangalore University (BU) has reduced the eligibility criteria for students belonging to scheduled tribe, scheduled caste, other backward classes communities to ensure that all its PhD seats are filled.

Even though the university has received six times more applications than the number of seats – 2,814 applications for 482 seats – not many have qualified for the seats.

The university has stated that the percentage in their entrance examination has been reduced from the existing 45%. “The percentage for the entrance test will be reduced, and we will reduce it till all our seats are filled,” said K.R. Venugopal, Vice Chancellor of the university. He said this was being done based on University Grants Commission (UGC) guidelines.

In the first round, general candidates are supposed to score 55% in their postgraduate, 50% in the entrance test, and have an overall score of 55%. For SC, ST and OBC students, the figures are 50% in their PG course, 45% in entrance examination and an overall score of 50%.

The university is yet to announce the merit list. The PhD entrance test was conducted on December 29 at five centres in the city. The university had stated that a majority of the applications, 813, have been received for doctoral programmes in arts, of which 726 were for English. The science department received 802 applications while the commerce department got 350 applications and 123 students have applied for PhD programmes in the Education Department.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/phd-seats-bu-reduces-eligibility-criteria-for-sc-st-obc-candidates/article30618465.ece
402,2020/01/21,Re-vaccination in adults shows potential to boost immunity against tuberculosis: Study,"Young Indian adults vaccinated at birth, but given the BCG vaccine once again, see an improvement in their immune response against tuberculosis (TB) by boosting the numbers and response of a specific subset of white blood cells called Th17 cells involved in fighting TB, a new study has found. Re-vaccination may make them less likely to develop the disease, it said.

The study, led by scientists at the Centre for Infectious Diseases Research (CIDR), Indian Institute of Science (IISc.), and published in the journal JCI Insight, was carried out in collaboration with clinicians and researchers in India, USA, Europe and the UK.

An IISc. release said about a quarter of the world’s population is thought to have latent TB, but have no disease symptoms, and have a 5 to 15% chance of falling ill with TB in their lifetime. The only clinically-approved TB vaccine is BCG, a weakened form of a bacterium called Mycobacterium bovis, which is administered at birth in India. It is effective in preventing tuberculosis meningitis and military disease in infants, but its effects rarely persist beyond 15 to 20 years, and young adults are particularly at risk of falling ill from TB.

“BCG is a tried and tested vaccine. There is now a lot of interest in trying to see if re-vaccination of young adults in the age group of 18 to 22 years is capable of boosting anti-TB immunity...We are able to demonstrate for the first time that re-vaccination is immunogenic in the Indian context. It induces the right type of immune cells,” Annapurna Vyakarnam, Fellow and Visiting Scientist at CIDR, and a senior author of the paper, was quoted as saying in the release.

According to the release, she and her colleagues recruited 200 young adults from Madanapalle in Andhra Pradesh, home to one of the oldest tuberculosis sanatoriums in the country. All the volunteers had been given BCG at birth. They were split into two groups: those who had latent TB – determined using a standard assay called QuantiFERON-TB Gold test, and those who did not carry the bacteria. Within each group, half of the individuals were re-vaccinated with BCG. Blood samples were extracted and analysed over nine months, and detailed flow cytometry investigations were carried out to check for the presence of up to 256 immune cell subsets.

“Compared to un-vaccinated individuals, re-vaccinated individuals were found to have more than twice as many immune cells belonging to specific subsets called CD4 and CD8 T-cells. These cells produce signalling proteins called cytokines that rally the body’s immune response against TB. Re-vaccination also boosted the numbers of innate immune cells that form the first line of defence against TB,” the release said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/re-vaccination-in-adults-shows-potential-to-boost-immunity-against-tuberculosis-study/article30618416.ece
403,2020/01/21,Baby weighing 5.9 kg born in Vani Vilas hospital,"At a time when low birth weight and malnourishment have become a major concern, a heavy male baby weighing 5.9 kilograms was born to Saraswati and Yogesh Mangare at the State-run Vani Vilas Hospital.

The baby was delivered by Caesarean section on January 18. As overweight newborns are normal in cases where the mother has diabetes, hypertension, abnormal thyroid levels or any other health issue, the first thing doctors did was to check if Ms. Saraswati had any complications. To their surprise, she had no abnormality. This is her second child who was born 14 years after her first delivery.

“The infant weighs the same as a three-month-old. Normally, newborn babies weigh 2.5 -3.5 kg. In rare cases, the weight can go up to 4.5 kg. Usually, a newborn is heavy if the mother has any health complication or the baby has cardiac or nephrology issues. We did some tests and found the baby to be normal,” Geeta Shivamurthy, Medical Superintendent, told The Hindu.

She said the mother and baby would be sent to Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences on Wednesday for further evaluation. “We have sent samples for inborn error of metabolism. The report of this test is awaited. The mother and baby have been moved from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) to the ward on Tuesday,” she said.

The couple hail from Darjeeling in Bengal. They have been residing in the city for the last 16 years.

According to doctors, the record so far for the heaviest newborn in India is held by a male baby weighing 6.8 kg born to Nandini in Hassan district in 2016. Earlier in November 2015, Firdous Khatun of Uttar Pradesh delivered a male child weighing 6.7 kg.

The world record for the heaviest baby is 10.2 kg for a boy born to Carmelina Fedele in Aversa, Italy, in September 1955.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/baby-weighing-59-kg-born-in-vani-vilas-hospital/article30618205.ece
404,2020/01/21,Chennai’s Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital performs 11th heart transplant,"Doctors at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) completed the hospital’s 11th heart transplant earlier this month, with an organ received from a cadaveric donor, who had been declared brain dead at the hospital.

G. Joseph Raj, Director of the Institute of Cardiothoracic Surgery, RGGGH, said the patient was recovering well and was likely to be discharged by the end of this week.

R. Mahendran (39), the patient, a mini truck driver from Coimbatore, had been suffering with rheumatic multi-vascular heart disease. His wife M. Amutha said that his condition had worsened around six months ago. “We took him to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital. The doctors there referred us to RGGGH. Though I was employed in a workshop, he was the main breadwinner. We have two children and were really worried about our future at that time,” she said.

Dr. Joseph Raj said that when Mr. Mahendran came to RGGGH, he had difficulty walking even for a few feet and was feeling breathless. “His heart’s ejection fraction was just 20% while it should have been at least around 60%. Our team of doctors decided that he needed a heart transplant,” he said.

The patient was put on a waitlist for a donor, R. Jayanthi, Dean, Madras Medical College and RGGGH, said. On January 5, 2019, a 27-year-old man, who was admitted to RGGGH after a road accident injury, was declared brain dead.

“As per the procedures of Transplant Authority, Government Of Tamil Nadu, with the consent of the person’s family, his heart, liver, kidneys and bone were harvested. The heart went to Mr. Mahendran and another patient in the hospital, got a kidney on the same day,” she said.

Dr. Jayanthi said the cost of the transplant was fully covered under the Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme. She said that since 2009, the hospital had performed 11 heart transplants. “This means our hospital has facilities as per the best standards in healthcare,” she said. On the survival rate of the patients who underwent heart transplants, she said a study was yet to be done. She also appreciated M. Vellingiri, Director, Institute of Anaesthesiology and Critical Care, and the team of doctors for their support in the surgery.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jmcp6r/article30613801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21JANTH-HEART,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-rajiv-gandhi-government-general-hospital-performs-11th-heart-transplant/article30613802.ece
405,2020/01/21,Pedestrian plaza in Chennai’s Pondy Bazaar shifts vehicular congestion to nearby localities,"The T. Nagar pedestrian plaza has been a grand success for the Chennai Corporation in providing a modern civic amenity. But a section of residents in neighbouring areas claim they have been affected by traffic congestion since the plaza has been opened.

Gopalakrishnan Road and Street, located adjacent to the Thyagaraya Road in Pondy Bazaar, were once peaceful and remained unaffected by the vehicular congestion that ruled Pondy Bazaar. However, since the pedestrian plaza was opened, residents are unable to venture out because of the frequent plying of share-autorickshaws and rashly driven two-wheelers on the road.

T. Arun, a resident of Gopalakrishnan Road, said after the pedestrian plaza was opened and traffic was made one-way, their locality has become busy with heavy traffic. He said since Gopalakrishnan Road connects Dr. Nair Road and G.N. Chetty Road, a large numbers of vehicles have started using these roads. Share-autorickshaws are causing severe inconvenience to pedestrians with senior citizens finding it difficult to walk safely.

The residents complained that the share autorickshaws, to save a few kilometres, violate the one-way rule at Muthukrishnan Street and enter Gopalakrishnan Street and Road to move between G.N. Chetty Road and Dr. Nair road frequently.

406,2020/01/21,College team from Poland wins the Indian Rover Challenge,"The 20-member team of AGH Space Systems breezed past the competition in the Indian Rover Challenge (IRC) 2020 on Monday.

The IRC is an event designed to build the next generation Mars Rover hosted by VIT Chennai. A total of 16 teams from different countries participated in the four-day event held from January 17 to 20.

The team from AGH University of Science and Technology in Poland with its four-wheeled aluminium-body rover outsmarted the other runners in the race in various challenges, including arm control mechanism, collection of soil samples, and autonomous traversing in rugged terrain. The team had already secured the second place in the European Rover Challenge, and IRC, last year.

Maciek Kotecki, a member of the AGH Space Systems, said the rover took more than three years to be built costing more than ₹10 lakhs. He said the team comprising students of automatics and robotics had a challenging task in producing the rover, weighing less than 50 kg. They had a rigorous testing process for performing different jobs to make it a model that could survive any rugged terrain.

407,2020/01/21,Chennai's transgender artistes find a stage in the Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha,"It is all about making voices heard at the Urur Olcott Kuppam Vizha which was rechristened Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha in 2018. The Vizha hosted its first Thirunar Vizha or Rainbow Festival at the Raga Sudha Hall, Mylapore over the weekend.

“One of the most important things about the Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha is to explore spaces that are associated with certain kinds of art forms; to be open to various other kinds of art forms. In that way we create an interaction across society,” says vocalist TM Krishna, a volunteer at the festival.

The event showcased performances by eminent artistes from the transgender community including A Revathi and the Tara Thirunangai Nadana Kuzhu.

Exhibited at the venue was The Red Wall Project spearheaded by activist Kalki Subramaniam’s Sahodari Foundation. The Red Wall Project features an acrylic portrait of an angry young transgender woman, painted by Kalki, surrounded by hand-written testimonials of transgender victims of sexual, physical, social and economic abuse.

It was started to help the transgender community voice out the abuse faced by its members across the country. The project encourages them to name the perpetrators. Kalki says, “We put the testimonials on walls whenever we get the opportunity. We cannot go to court to punish these culprits. But what happens to them?”

“We wanted to protest and protect our community in the future. We are doing it in an aesthetic yet powerful way,” says Kalki.

Kalki herself is a survivor of sexual violence, “When I was studying in the first year of college, a senior sexually assaulted me. They take advantage of you. You feel subhuman through their actions.”

While some of the stories were read out at the event, many were displayed on the walls of the venue for visitors to read. Kalki says, “Despite not being able to get justice, we have a voice through this project. It is the epitome of protest art.”

Apart from being an activist, Kalki herself dons several hats including those of artist, poet, actor and inspirational speaker. “Art is a very powerful medium. It is my livelihood. I make pop art and sell them to help my financial needs. Some of my poetry has been in the educational curriculum of college students and it is making a change there,” says Kalki.

“Through The Red Wall Project people get paid for interviewing. We create relationships and support the people we meet in all ways possible. We are also invited to different places to perform through which we can sensitise the audience through our art,” she says.

Kalki says, “The violence against transgender and gender non-confirming people is never discussed in our society or in our media because there is no opportunity for us to talk about it. We have been constantly fighting. The space to talk about it, like this one, has been extremely minimal.”

“The focus of the Vizha is to celebrate diversity, different expressions, different sexualities, genders, different kinds of expression of art forms by different people,” says TM Krishna.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/nyioyz/article30611121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21mpsnippetARGSK70IQH13jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennais-transgender-artistes-find-a-stage-in-the-chennai-kalai-theru-vizha/article30612454.ece

412,2020/01/21,200 dropouts from Corpn. schools yet to be traced,"As many as 200 students of Chennai Corporation schools have dropped out during the current academic year. Their families have also reportedly shifted from the addresses furnished in the school records, making it difficult to trace the students and bring them back to school, officials said.

The students who dropped out are from high schools and higher secondary schools at 70 locations in the city, according to officials.

Corporation school teachers are worried as these 200 students are likely to end up as manual labourers, having lost the opportunity to complete school education.

No luck so far

In previous years, the teachers were able to trace most of the dropouts, zero in on the reasons and bring them back on the rolls. This year, they have so far been unable to trace the whereabouts of the students and their family members. “Most of the students may permanently lose the opportunity to get school education if we do not trace them before the end of this month,” said a teacher.

According to data compiled, these students dropped out of the schools between June and December 2019.

This month, teams of teachers reportedly visited the homes of the students who dropped out, but they did not find the families of the students at the address provided to school authorities.

The new addresses of the families is also not known as of now. The teachers have informed higher officials that it is difficult to find the dropouts.

Multiple reasons

Corporation teachers said they were studying the reasons for the dropouts. “Many students whose families have been resettled could have been affected. Rising crime rates in resettled areas is a challenge to the education of teenagers. A crime by an individual can affect the entire family. We are studying other reasons also. We have to find out whether the economic condition has affected the students,” said a teacher.

Among the Corporation schools, over 40% offer quality education free of cost, registering better results compared to other private schools in the neighbourhood.

A few smart classrooms have also been developed in the Corporation schools, making them more attractive. But 60% of the Corporation schools have continued to register a dip in student enrolment in the past few years.

Relocation effect?

Corporation officials said most of the schools have been located near slums along Cooum and Adyar river where resettlement has reduced the student strength.

Schools in the vicinity of more than 50 slums along the Cooum river have reported a dip in student numbers, after the relocation process started.

Resettlement of families along Buckingham Canal is expected to reduce the number of students from 85,000 to less than 50,000 in the Corporation schools, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/2y6ce4/article30610774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21Schoolcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/200-dropouts-from-corpn-schools-yet-to-be-traced/article30610775.ece

414,2020/01/21,Opioid-dependent patients can now avail of methadone treatment at IMH,"The Drug Treatment Clinic (DTC) at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Chennai is all set to provide Methadone Maintenance Treatment for opioid-dependent patients. The treatment, which is aimed at managing opioid use disorders through harm reduction using methadone, will be run on the lines of directly observed treatment short-course; patients will take the syrup preparation in the presence of a qualified psychiatrist at the clinic.

Established under the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC) scheme, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, the DTC at IMH was the first one to be established in south India under the scheme. It extends treatment for all kinds of substance abuse and its related disorders. This included addiction to alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, inhalants and sleeping pills; opioid abuse being the newly added target for treatment considering the large-scale abuse of this substance, according to officials.

Special team

As of now, there are 22 DTCs across the country, including the one at IMH. P. Poorna Chandrika, director of IMH, said the institute entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with AIIMS last year following which the clinic was set up. A special team comprising a psychiatrist, psychiatric staff nurse and counsellor was trained for the clinic.

Now, the institute has received supply of oral methadone and dispensers from NDDTC. Patients can walk into the clinic with an identity card and start treatment after appropriate evaluation, she said. Until now, the treatment was not available in the government sector in the State.

The idea, according to officials, is to primarily manage opioid use disorders in opioid-dependent patients. “The aim is to relieve use of street opioids and subsequently, prevent transmission of diseases including HIV due to sharing of needles. This is a harm reduction strategy,” a doctor said.

Doctors added that patients can visit the clinic for treatment. Once initiated, they should come every day and would be evaluated for withdrawal symptoms.

After observation, the preparation would be given to the patient in the presence of the team — a qualified psychiatrist, psychiatric staff nurse and counsellor — and they cannot take it home.

The dose would be calculated for each patient.

Doctors said the scheme also provided another drug — Naltrexone — that is being used for both opioid and alcohol use disorders after appropriate evaluation.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xyqlme/article30611523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THKILPAUKIMH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/opioid-dependent-patients-can-now-avail-of-methadone-treatment-at-imh/article30610757.ece
415,2020/01/21,Builder asked to pay ₹5 lakh compensation to senior citizen,"The Tamil Nadu State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Chennai has directed developer Ramaniyam Real Estates Pvt Ltd to pay ₹5 lakh compensation and refund amount paid by a senior citizen for buying a flat along with interest.

According to complaint filed by K.R. Parthasarathy, 69, he had booked a flat in the project developed for senior citizens at Sholinganallur by Appudhi Real Estates Pvt Ltd in 2013. The firm subsequently got merged with Ramaniyam. The builder had promised to provide access control system to the building and buzzer alarm in each room of the flat, he said. He had paid about ₹44.27 lakh towards purchase of UDS, cost of construction and other services.

In his complaint, he claimed that the builder lured him to enter into an agreement to a flat meant for senior citizens by promising to provide special security facilities such as access control system to the building, but has not kept their promise despite repeated requests. In its response, the builder said it never promised or undertook to provide the security facilities namely access control. and that it had constructed the flat as per specifications set out in the construction agreement. The Commission rejected the builder’s argument and noted that it is a novel and ingenious argument. “Any construction agreement would not contain the particulars of common facilities like lifts, pathways, children play area, sewerage treatment plant, club house, gym etc. But these amenities and facilities would invariably find place in the brochure or any other kind of advertisement,” it noted. Therefore, the builder cannot argue that the buyer has no right to ask for the amenities and facilities, which are not mentioned in the construction agreement, the Commission said.

Further, the builder said the facility had to be provided by Covai Senior Care Construction Ltd (with which it had entered into an agreement).

The Commission concluded that there was deficiency in service on the part of the builder and directed it to pay compensation for mental agony and hardship caused to the buyer.

It also told the builder to refund ₹44.27 lakh along with interest of ₹11.29 lakh accrued till December 31, 2016 and thereafter with interest at 9% per annum for ₹44.27 lakh till payment and ₹10,000 litigation cost to the buyer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/builder-asked-to-pay-5-lakh-compensation-to-senior-citizen/article30610746.ece
416,2020/01/21,Creating a space for children with learning disabilities,"With the end of the academic year just a couple of months away, schools have already begun sounding out parents of children with specific learning disabilities to look for other schools for their children.

Naturally, that has them worried. Some of them have managed to reach out to Blink Foundation and 3R Research & Technology, in a desperate measure to see if anything can be done at all.

“If children with learning difficulties study in schools that are not inclusive or institutions that refuse to pursue necessary interventions, they are often asked to leave at the end of the school year,” says Arun Fernandez, managing director, Blink Foundation, and 3R Research & Technology. 3R inaugurated a new learning centre at Nungambakkam on Monday and Mr. Arun, who was diagnosed with dyslexia when he was 13, said that the centre aims to create a better learning environment for children with Specific Learning Disabilities (SLDs).

With the use of assistive technology, skill development, a specially-designed curriculum and remedial tutors, the centre will cater to children with learning difficulties as well as motivate students of classes 10 and 12 to take up the board exams through the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS).

Celebrating learners

In India, one in 5 school-going children have SLDs and in Chennai , the foundation has seen it in nearly 10 % of children in the schools, where they screened for SLDs. While there are a few inclusive schools, Mr. Arun said that more mainstream schools should attempt to understand children with learning difficulties and celebrate all learners.

“We have set up 3R labs in four schools in the city and these are well defined learning spaces where children with learning difficulties can learn reading, writing and arithmetic with learning aids and study modules under tutors,” he explained.

M.P. Subisha, who works with Business Development at 3R Research said that in schools, they create awareness among the faculty members and also address the parents. “After the screening process, we speak to the parents of children who have learning difficulties about the interventions that can be taken,” she added.

Unity Public School in the city has a 3R lab on campus being used by 60 students. “Even if we carry out a screening and inform parents that their children might have a learning difficulty, there is still some resistance from their side with regard to making the necessary interventions. Through the lab which functions during class hours, we hope to have a more inclusive environment where the needs of all our learners can be addressed,” said Nisar Ahmed Shariff, CEO, Unity Group of schools.

As a next step, the Blink Foundation is working with the National Institute for Empowerment of Persons with Multiple Disabilities towards validating an informal screening tool which parents can use a to identify children at risk of SLD.

""This is not a labelling tool but can be used by the parents to identify if their children are at risk. Through this, we're hoping there is early identification and intervention ,"" Mr. Arun added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/creating-a-space-for-children-with-learning-disabilities/article30610719.ece
417,2020/01/21,HC refuses to order notice in case filed by American International School,"The Madras High Court on Monday refused to order notices to the Centre as well as the State government on a writ petition filed by the American International School at Taramani here to declare that certain provisions of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act of 2009 would not be applicable to it.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad said, notices could be ordered only if the school management submits sufficient documents to prima facie satisfy the court that it enjoys an immunity from the applicability of the RTE Act and could function without due recognition from the State government. Though the school had sought to declare the contentious provisions of the RTE Act as unconstitutional and illegal, the judges said, the Supreme Court had already upheld the validity of the Act and therefore the petitioner could now seek only for non applicability of those provisions in so far as the petitioner institution was concerned. They granted it time till February 5 for submitting the bilateral agreement reportedly entered between the U.S. and India in 1995 for establishing the school with the objective of providing international education to children of expatriates and other such documents to prove its assertion that the RTE Act would not be applicable to it. In its affidavit, the school stated that out of 830 students studying at present, 90% of them were not Indian nationals. The majority of the students belonged to 30 different nationalities. In May last, the Chief Educational Officer (CEO) issued a notice asking the school to obtain recognition under the RTE Act within 15 days or end up facing a shut down.

Despite the school submitting a response, the CEO ordered closure of the institution. However, the High Court quashed the closure order in November last, the petitioner said and complained that certain provisions of the RTE Act were being regularly used as a tool by the CEO to harass the officials of the school.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-refuses-to-order-notice-in-case-filed-by-american-international-school/article30610713.ece

419,2020/01/21,TPDK plans protest near Rajinikanth’s house today,"The Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam has announced a protest in front of actor Rajinikanth’s house at Poes Garden on Tuesday for allegedly misleading the public about the anti-superstition rally led by social reformer Periyar E V Ramasamy in Salem in 1971 at Tamil magazine Thuglak’s 50th anniversary event in Chennai recently.

The actor had controversially claimed that Periyar led a rally where “naked pictures” of Lord Ram and Sita with slipper garlands were paraded.

TPDK general secretary Kovai Ramakrishnan demanded an apology from Mr. Rajinikanth for his speech, which, he said, brought disrepute to the social reformer.

Last week, the Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam filed a complaint against the actor in Coimbatore and a few other places and threatened to stage a protest outside his house.

Mr. Ramakrishnan said the protest was planned as the actor had not apologised. “Nothing of the sort (as described by the actor) happened in the rally,” he said.

Mr. Ramakrishnan pointed out that the pictures of the protest circulated online “were actually hand-drawn art works based on what was said in ‘puranas.”

He said artists were commissioned to draw those images based on popular religious ‘puranas’. Asked why Periyarists were defending Periyar while he was a caustic critic of Hindu gods and religion, Mr. Ramakrishnan said, “Periyar opposed idea of God by speaking about ‘puranas’. He spoke about Ramayana and he quoted things from the book. But, he never did what Rajinikanth has claimed.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tpdk-plans-protest-near-rajinikanths-house-today/article30610652.ece

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad issued the direction while disposing of a public interest litigation petition filed by S. Aanantharaj of Villupuram district who had complained of the poor condition of most of the government-run hostels including the one at Saidapet.

After the petitioner’s counsel P.

Insofar as the MC Raja College Boys Hostel was concerned, the government had taken several initiatives to improve the infrastructure, he said.

Funds allocated

Out of ₹6.57 crore sanctioned in 2011-12 for repair and renovation of 21 hostels in Chennai district, ₹1.09 crore was allocated to the Saidapet hostel where works were carried out apart from purchasing materials and books for the library.

Again in 2018, the government sanctioned ₹8.32 crore for repair and maintenance of 14 hostels in Chennai and of it, ₹66.94 lakh was allotted to the Public Works Department for renovating the toilets, bath area and kitchen at MC Raja College Boys Hostel besides repairing the water supply lines, doors and windows, the official said.

421,2020/01/21,"Chief Minister misleading the public on CAA, says DMK chief","DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday accused Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami of hoodwinking and misleading the people by spreading disinformation and painting a false picture of the implications of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens.

Addressing a public meeting after unveiling a statue of late DMK patriarch and former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi at Kalaignar Arivalayam in Villupuram, he said that while the whole country was on the boil, the Chief Minister was claiming that nothing will happen as a result of the implementation of the CAA.

Mr. Stalin scoffed at Mr. Palaniswami’s statement that the government will initiate steps to confer dual citizenship on Sri Lankan Tamil refugees. This was absolutely impossible as there was no provision in the relevant legislations in either India or Sri Lanka to grant dual citizenship, he pointed out.

The CAA and the NRC had brought about sustained protests across the country, from Kashmir to Kanniyakumari. The AIADMK government had betrayed Sri Lankan Tamils and minorities by claiming that nothing will happen as a result of the implementation of the CAA, he said.

Using cinema parlance, the DMK leader said his party’s victory in the rural local body polls was only the ‘interval’, while the ‘climax’ will come during the next Assembly polls. He reiterated that once he is voted into power, he will order a probe into former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s death and bring to book those involved in the Pollachi sexual harassment case and the Kodanad estate ‘murders’.

Mr. Palaniswami had been unable to digest the “record performance” of the DMK in the local body polls, he said. The party will score victories in the elections to urban local bodies as well as the Assembly polls in 2021, he added.

Mr. Stalin said it was surprising that Mr. Palaniswami had been claiming credit for the awards received by the government for good governance, adding that such awards had lost their value.

Everyone knew that the law and order situation in the State was bad, he said. “How can the Chief Minister’s claims be justified when a Special Sub-Inspector was shot dead, allegedly by extremists, at a check-post in Kanniyakumari?” he asked.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/p70ut5/article30610547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21STALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chief-minister-misleading-the-public-on-caa-says-dmk-chief/article30610548.ece

423,2020/01/21,Redesigning India’s ailing data system,"The new series of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures with 2011-12 as base, released in 2015, has not gone well with analysts; the withholding of employment-unemployment data for some time and consumer expenditure data, which is not released, added to this unease. Bringing the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) under the fold of National Statistics Office, altering its long-standing arrangement under the Governing Council and then National Statistical Commission, triggered suspicion. As official statistics is a public good, giving information about the state of the economy and success of governance, it needs to be independent to be impartial.

Wide-ranging impact

GDP covers all productive activity for producing goods and services, without duplication. In effect it adds apples and oranges, tractors and sickles, trade, transport, storage and communication, real estate, banking and government services through the mechanism of value. The System of National Accounting (SNA) is designed to measure production, consumption, and accumulation of income and wealth for assessing the performance of the economy. GDP data influence markets, signalling investment sentiments, flow of funds and balance of payments. The input-output relations impact productivity and allocation of resources; demand and supply influences prices, exchange rates, wage rates, employment and standard of living, affecting all walks of life.

The data on GDP are initially estimated at current price and then deflated for constant price for comparability of data over time. It is necessary to separate out price effect to adjust value for real volume for comparison over time and sectors. There is a way of adjusting price effect through appropriate price index. The present series encountered serious problems for price adjustment, specifically for the services sector contributing about 60% of GDP, in the absence of appropriate price indices for most service sectors. The deflators used in the new series could not effectively separate out price effect from the current value to arrive at a real volume estimate at constant price. Price indices going into a low and negative zone in 2014-17 distorted real growth.

The shift from establishment to enterprise approach, replacing Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) with Ministry of Corporate Affairs MCA21 posed serious data and methodological issues. The use of MCA21 data and blow up factors thereof without weeding out defunct enterprises, and then insufficient work on mapping of comparable ASI data, followed by similar survey on services sector enterprises were another major lacunae.

Unchanged approach

The approach for collection of data remains largely the same for long: price and production indices are constructed using a fixed base Laspeyres Index, yield rate for paddy is estimated by crop cutting experiments, and the organisation of field surveys for collection of data on employment-unemployment, consumer expenditure, industrial output, assets and liabilities continue. When productivity and remunerative price of output are major concerns for agriculture, it is necessary to collect data on factors such as soil conditions, moisture, temperature, water and fertilizer use determining yield, impact of intermediary and forward trade on farm gate price and so on. For example, Israel collects these data for analysis to support productivity. The initiative under e-governance enabled the capturing of huge data, which need to be collated for their meaningful use for production of official statistics. The process for collection and collation of data needs modernisation using technology.

Data logistics

Along with GDP, we need data to assess competitiveness, inclusive growth, fourth-generation Industrial Revolution riding on the Internet of things, biotechnology, robotics-influencing employment and productivity, environmental protection, sustainable development and social welfare. Hence GDP data needs to be linked with a host of other data for deeper insight. We need to re-engineer the existing system, creating an integrated system populated with granular data. The country is vast, heterogeneous. There are non-linearities and path dependence, which should be considered while setting goals for development, reducing regional imbalance. To pursue the goal of a $5-trillion economy by 2024-25, harnessing demographic dividend, we must tap underused resources for demand creating investment, which require data to pursue policy right from a district and evaluate performance for efficiency including governance.

We cannot reconcile data inconsistencies by setting up committees alone. We need systems which have the capability to sift through a huge volume of data seamlessly to look for reliability, validity, consistency and coherence which, I am afraid, will be difficult without the aid of a versatile data warehouse as a component of big-data technology. Also such committees should have the support of a dedicated team for audit, and the ability to implement decisions by cutting red tape. This is what has been wanting as thoughtful and well-meaning key recommendations of the Rangarajan Commission and subsequent recommendations from 2006 onwards by successive National Statistical Commissions, faced stumbling blocks in implementation. What is the guarantee that the recently constituted committee will succeed in its effort to restore credibility? It is as much a system and has implementation capability as the expertise behind it.

The present and future

The present national accounting and analytical framework misses out on many important dimensions of the economy and its complex character as an evolving economy that is constantly experiencing technological and institutional transitions and power plays in a market economy. We need a new framework for analysis for such a complex system and evolutionary process. There is a question of growing market power, automation, robotisation and other labour-replacing technologies affecting profitability, structural change and general welfare.

We need to find alternative avenues for the unemployed and jobs lost. In order to inject efficiency and stability, we need to have detailed data on how: markets clear, prices are formed, risks build up, institutions function and, in turn, influence the lifestyle of various sections of the people. We also need to know in greater detail about market microstructure and optimality therein, the role of technology and advanced research, changing demand on human skills, and enterprise and organising ability, which are all complex. The growing inequality and concentration of wealth in a few hands to the detriment of social welfare needs to be arrested at the earliest. The deadweight loss caused to the economy through monopoly power, inefficient input-output mix, dumping, obsolete technology and production mix must be contained.

The consensus macroeconomic framework of analysis assumes symmetric income distribution, and does not get into the depth of structural issues, as it focuses on a trend-cycle decomposition of GDP for growth and stability in market parlance and a trickledown effect for percolation of income. This framework is questioned by many. The alternative to be realistic for the real world must rest on two pillars: the micro-behaviour of individuals, and the structure of their mutual interactions. In the changed situation of availability of micro data, we need to build a system to integrate the micro with the macro, maintaining distributional characteristics.

Data is the new oil in the modern networked economy in pursuit of socio-economic development. The economics now is deeply rooted in data, measuring and impacting competitiveness, risks, opportunities and social welfare in an integrated manner, going much beyond macroeconomics. We have a commitment to produce these statistics transparently, following internationally accepted standards, tailor-made to suit local conditions, for multi-disciplinary analytics. As these statistics reflect on the performance of the government, it is necessary that its independence is maintained scrupulously.

424,2020/01/21,Crossing boundaries,"The “Needless fracas” (Editorial, January 20) is not necessarily limited to the States of West Bengal or Kerala. Sometime ago, New Delhi, and more recently Puducherry, faced a similar situation. Various governments over the years have never hesitated to use the office of the Governor toward meeting their political goals. This has been proved by the recent gubernatorial interventions in Karnataka and Maharashtra. The question that needs a answer, in turn leading to a relook is this: should the office of the Governor be a political appointment or an elected office? As political appointees they are not immune to party compulsions.

The present Westminster or the earlier Raj model, a colonial relic, of nominating Governors should be changed and be made an elected office as is the norm in a democracy. The office of the Governor will then be accountable to voters and their decisions non-partisan.

H.N. Ramakrishna,

The Governors of West Bengal and Kerala have given short shrift to constitutional certitudes; their actions are more like right-wing ideologues to please their political bosses. It ill-behoves the nation that someone holding such a high office expresses such views.

S.S. Paul,

Chakdaha, Nadia, West Bengal

Essentially, a Governor of a State/Union Territory is required to play a proactive role rather than a provocative role in the overall governance of a State/UT. As such it would be prudent that persons of high academic calibre with blemishless credentials are required to be appointed as Governors. There is also an imperative need to institutionalise a collegium-like system for the appointment of Governors if they are to have a meaningful role as custodians of our great democracy.

426,2020/01/21,The real India,"The report, from Kerala, “Mosque answers Hindu woman’s prayer for help” (Page 1, January 20), is a welcome development in the prevailing conditions. Such rivetting gestures will go a long way in strengthening the bonds between communities. There is much to be learnt from this heart-warming incident.

S. Vidyadhar,

Hyderabad

By solemnising a Hindu marriage in the premises of a Kerala mosque, the Cheravally Muslim Jamat Committee which organised the event as well as the people of Kerala have added one more feather to their cap of religious harmony. They have also in the process proven why the State of Kerala is rightly termed as the most progressive ones in India . Under the surcharged communal situation prevalant in the country, that a Hindu woman had no hesitation in approaching a Muslim body for help and in return the body too expressing its willingness readily to conduct the marriage of her daughter at their own cost, speaks volumes, come what may, that humanity will ultimately prevail over other distracting factors. Politicians who thrive on acts of appeasement and polarisation with ulterior motives are well advised to take a cue from this exhibition of unparallelled bonhomie between two divergent communities and desist from acts that would bring enmity and endanger India’s communal harmony, amity and peace.

The report appearing on page 1 is a great gesture in these troubled times in India. The people of Kerala must be thanked for the way in which they have upheld friendship, harmony and love which is the need of the hour for the Nation.

They must regret their religious bigotism and divisive agenda which is greatly harming the unity of India.

While it is highly gratifying to read the report, the fact is that there have also been numerous and far nobler instances of internal communal bonhomie taking place all across the country but which do not get similar front page coverage.

427,2020/01/21,Kegel Workout,"Some exercises work exclusively on 'inner spaces' rather than on muscles that are seen. For instance, if you suddenly have the urge to urinate and are not sure if you will find a loo in time, a few quick clenching of the pelvic floor muscles are enough to get you to a restroom in time. You've just done a Kegel exericse.

In 1948, American gynaecologist at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Dr Arnold Kegel, introduced a set of exercises as a non-surgical treatment to prevent women in particular, from 'leaking'. They strengthened the pelvic floor muscles that support the bladder, bowel and uterus. “For the last 72 years, it has remained the first-line treatment for urinary stress incontinence,” says Dr Renu Misra, a gynaecologist in Apollo-Miracles, Gurugram.

Kegel exercises are especially beneficial for women as our pelvic muscles weaken with childbirth, pregnancy, aging and weight gain. “With hormonal and age-related changes in the body, the pelvic organs tend to hang in a condition called Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP). In women who undergo hysterectomy, the vaginal tissue can also start coming out of the body, due to a lax pelvic floor,” says Dr Misra.

After Dr Kegel’s research turned the attention to the benefits of pelvic floor muscles (that act like a hammock, extending from the front of the pelvis to the tailbone), his findings gained acceptance and popularity. Dr Kegel came to be known as the pelvic health hero. The versatile muscles that form the pelvic floor are colloquially referred to as the Kegel muscles and the workout is also named after him.

The simplest way to perform Kegels is to just keep contracting the pelvic muscles several times a day. It can be done in any position, while sitting, standing or lying down.

“Kegel is like a resistive exercise that can prevent urine leakage also triggered by frequent or sudden coughing, sneezing, laughing, bending over or lifting something heavy. It helps women to recover their pelvic muscles strength even after years of disuse,” says Dr Shailesh Rana, Director of Urology at Jaslok Hospital & Research Centre, Mumbai. It helps treating bladder leakage in men too, whose bowel or sexual function weaken after surgical removal of the prostate, he adds.

However, it is important to understand what constitutes the pelvic floor and how it works. Dr Rana recommends it as a standard practice to his patients who need help with incontinence. “Doing it is no big deal but one needs to find and work with the right muscles to relax or contract for the desired effect,” he says. “Those who regularly exercise often do not even realise that they are doing Kegel automatically with their stretching and strengthening exercises. To find the right muscles to exercise, pretend you are trying to avoid passing gas.

It does not take much to repeat the squeezing of the muscles of the pelvic floor, says Dr Vineet Narang, Urology Head at Delhi-based Indian Spinal Injuries Centre but insists that it should be done consistently at least for two to four weeks. “Aim for 4 sets of 10 repetitions a day while breathing freely,” he recommends. “You should not hold your breath while doing Kegels or flex the muscles in your abdomen, thighs or buttocks,” he says. “For better results, it is best to empty your bladder before you start doing the exercise and avoid doing them while peeing as it may cause Urinary Tract Infection.”",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/kegel-workout/article30615463.ece

Panaji Police have arrested Satish Nilkanthe, a resident of neighbouring Maharashtra, for allegedly stabbing Aria, the official said.

A police complaint was lodged by Rahul Tripathi, director of foreign students at the Goa University, he said.

The accused has been booked under Section 326 of the Indian Penal Code(voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means), he said.

Search was on for three other accused who were at large, he added.

Meanwhile, National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) Goa chief Ahraz Mulla wrote a letter to Governor Satya Pal Malik after the incident and expressed fear of a “JNU-like situation” in the Goa University.

“This is to bring to your notice the recent attack on an Afghani student in Goa. The law and order in the state has gone for a ride and students of Goa are fearing a JNU-like situation here very soon with such attacks (coming to notice) on a regular basis,” Mr. Mulla said.

The NSUI, which is the students’ wing of the Congress, said the attack on the Afghani student in Goa also raises questions about the security of students who come from other countries to study here.

The incident will send a “very wrong message” to the entire world about law and order of the country, MR. Mulla said.

He demanded strong action against those who were spoiling the harmony of Goa University and police protection in all colleges of the State to prevent a “JNU or Jamia-like” situation.

Goa Pradesh Congress Committee president Girish Chodankar demanded a thorough probe into the incident, which he said has “tarnished the image of Goa“.

“The poison spread by state-sponsored actions is provoking the youth to resort to such acts. Day in and day out, hatred is being spread, because of which such attacks happen. The police should properly investigate the case,” Mr. Chodankar said.

Taking to Twitter, Independent MLA Rohan Khaunte said, “I strongly condemn the attack on Afghani student studying in #GoaUniversity. Quick police action against the offenders is a must. This fanaticism is offensive of the very ethos of Goenkarponn! (Goanness).”

“Law and order in the State has gone for a ride, sending a wrong message to national and international community,” he said in another tweet.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/i6z6gm/article30615862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/girish-chodankarjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/afghan-student-stabbed-near-goa-university-one-held/article30615371.ece

430,2020/01/21,"BJP, Sena attack Prithviraj Chavan over claims of coalition offer in 2014","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Shiv Sena have hit out at Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan over his claims that the two saffron partners were on the verge of a spilt in 2014.

In an interview to a news agency the former Chief Minister recently said that the Shiv Sena had proposed a coalition, like the present Maha Vikas Aghadi, with the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) after the 2014 Assembly elections with the sole intention of stopping the BJP from coming to power. The proposal was, however, rejected by the Congress party high command, he said.

Reacting to Mr. Chavan’s statement, former chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said thanks to Mr. Chavan the true face of the Sena lies exposed. The revelation made by a senior leader like Mr. Chavan must be taken seriously. “That the Sena was prepared to form a three-party coalition after the polls in 2014, is a shocking revelation. This has exposed Sena’s true face and shows that for them ideology and value system are not beyond the lust for power. They should now give voters an answer,” said Mr. Fadnavis, who is also the Leader of Opposition now.

Mr. Chavan also claimed that Congress president Sonia Gandhi was not ready for a tie up with Shiv Sena even in 2019, but relented only after long deliberations with senior party leaders. Asked if the coalition government would last a full term, Mr. Chavan said there was no 100% guarantee for a three-party government to last full term. However, in this case the three have come together to keep the BJP away since it tried killing the Opposition and betraying the Sena.

Reacting to the claims made by Mr. Chavan, Shiv Sena leader and Minister for Transport and Parliamentary Affairs Anil Parab said he was not aware of any offer made by the Sena to Congress and the NCP.

“Mr. Chavan should come clean on which Sena leader provided him with the information about such an offer in 2014. I do not know of any such proposal,” he said.

Senior NCP leader and Cabinet minister Nawab Malik too denied having any knowledge of the Sena overtures five years back. “If they had separately contacted the Congress then it is a different story. But the NCP never received any offer from the Sena back then,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lcra8p/article30610640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMPRITHVIRAJCHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjp-sena-attack-prithviraj-chavan-over-claims-of-coalition-offer-in-2014/article30610641.ece
431,2020/01/21,Man on the run for a year-and-a-half arrested,"The Economic Offences Wing of Unit I of the Navi Mumbai Police recently arrested a man, who had been wanted for a year-and-a-half from Taloja.

The accused, Raghunath Karande (35), has been accused of cheating around 50 people of ₹1.5 crore. While five of his accomplices had been arrested earlier, Mr. Karande, the mastermind, had been absconding. “He kept moving from one location to the other in the State and we were tipped off that he had moved to Taloja and was planning to con more people,” assistant police inspector Anand Shahane said.

On January 15, Mr. Shahane and police constable Ashok Kankhare travelled to Kamadhenu society in Sector 9 to arrest Mr. Karande, and found him sitting on the watchman’s chair. As the policemen confronted the accused, his wife interfered and blocked the police so he could flee. However, Mr. Karande tripped and fell after a short distance and the police grabbed him. This time, he assaulted the personnel and got his shirt torn off so he could run again. Eventually, Mr. Karande was caught with the help of the public.

“The accused would pose as real estate agents of a registered company and take the victims to buildings in Ulwe where apartments were ready for possession. They told people that due to financial crisis, flats worth ₹55 lakh were being sold at ₹35 lakh,” Mr. Shahane said. The accused would also fool the watchman of the building by saying that they had been sent by the builder.

Besides Navi Mumbai, Mr. Karande is also wanted by the Pune city, Pune rural and Thane city police. Since he assaulted the officials, he has now also been booked under Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code.

432,2020/01/21,Maharashtra secretariat changes War Room to Mission Room,"The War Room in Mantralaya will now be called Sankalp Kaksha or Mission Room. According to official sources, the idea for the change came from Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray who felt the word ‘war’ had a negative connotation.

Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had opened the room to review projects such as the Metro.

New concept

In May 2015, Mr. Fadnavis held his first meeting in the ‘CM’s War Room’, a concept new to Mantralaya and one that garnered media attention. Its objective was to push long-pending projects stuck in bureaucratic bottlenecks with military efficiency; hence the name. The room had a dash board, maps, and projectors for showing drone surveys, among other things.

It was headed by Officer on Special Duty to the CM Kaustubh Dhavse who worked in close coordination with the CM’s additional chief secretary Praveen Pardeshi. Mr. Dhavse was assisted by interns with degrees from premier institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology. Some of the projects monitored in the War Room included the Metro projects, Coastal Road, Navi Mumbai airport, irrigation projects and the Shivaji statue that were in the offing for more than a decade.

Only the top-most bureaucrats and ministers had access to the 50-seater room, where confidential decisions were taken. For example, if a project related to Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority was being discussed, only the top official and an additional officer were allowed, apart from the relevant secretaries, ministers and chief secretary. A schedule would be drawn a week in advance and meetings would be held once in two months.

“We would work in war mode, reviewing 30 projects in two hours. Targets and strategies were time-bound, people were focused on delivering specific targets. The drone footage would be used to corroborate on-ground information. People couldn’t point fingers at each other as the person concerned would be in the meeting. In the war room, we executed 375 km of Metro lines, started work on the Navi Mumbai airport that was held up for 25 years,” said Mr. Dhavse, who refused to comment on the name change.

The MVA government has given its own spin to the effort. A source in the CMO said, “It was the CM’s idea to change its name. He felt the word ‘war’ was negative and wanted a more positive word. The government takes up a lot of missions and this room will monitor all of them. Hence, the new name.”

Another source in the CMO said, “The CM felt the word Mission Room or Sankalp Kaksha was more appropriate. This is Maharashtra, so we should have a Marathi name. That is why it was changed. It sounds more appropriate, but it is not a move for political one-upmanship.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pdg8mm/article30610621.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BM-Sankalp-Kaksha,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-secretariat-changes-war-room-to-mission-room/article30610622.ece
433,2020/01/21,"You see the best, worst of humans in science: Nobel laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan","Nobel laureate Venkatraman ‘Venki’ Ramakrishnan walked a large audience, consisting mainly of scientists and students, through his journey of studying the structure and function of a ribosome at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research on Monday.

Dr. Ramakrishnan, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2009, was speaking at the TNQ Distinguished Lectures in the Life Sciences. “I started off as a physicist and flopped at it, and then I switched fields. Then why did I even succeed? One reason was that I tried to keep my options open. So when the physics didn’t work out, I tried to give myself a second chance,” said Mr. Ramakrishnan, who switched to biology after a PhD in physics.

Dr. Ramakrishnan said he was never afraid of asking for help and seeing famous people asking naive questions encouraged him to do so. He said, “One thing I like to tell students is that everybody has an impostor syndrome. When I went to Yale [University], I felt that all those people were smart and I didn’t belong there. If you are an outsider, let’s say you might be from another country or a racial minority, then you might feel even more of this syndrome.”

After working on the components of ribosomes for several years, Dr. Ramakrishnan and other researchers were able map the structure of ribosomes, which is made of thousands of atoms. Their work is said to be crucial in many applications, including making new antibiotics.

On his scientific journey, Dr Ramakrishnan said many people gave him technical advice and made reagents for him to carry on with research. He said, “People who gave me reagents did not even ask to be co-authors. So you really see the best and worst of humans in science.”

‘Don’t learn for prizes’

A critic of the system of prizes, Dr. Ramakrishnan said prizes are given out from primary school. He said, “Instead of learning for the sake of learning or learning science for the pleasure of finding things out, you have this sort of injection.”

According to Dr. Ramakrishnan, people often discount the importance of luck. “Almost all of us have had lucky breaks that have led to breakthroughs. But the important thing is that when you get that lucky break, you have to recognise it,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5mfaxq/article30610610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMDRVENKIRAMAKRISHNAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/you-see-the-best-worst-of-humans-in-science/article30610611.ece
434,2020/01/21,Teach students what they love: Dr. Wangchuk,"Students often learn the things they do not like, and if they were taught what they enjoyed, they would like to go to school, says Dr. Sonam Wangchuk, engineer, innovator and education reformist from Ladakh.

Speaking at the SBAC-2020 (Business Academia Conclave) ‘Innovation and Technology’ held in the city recently, Dr. Wangchuk gave in insight into the reforms in education in Ladakh, one of which is the Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement in Ladakh (SECMOL) that he started. SECMOL aims to bring about reforms in the government school system.

“In 1994, I was instrumental in the launch of Operation New Hope, a collaboration of the government, village communities and civil society, to bring about reforms in the government school system,” he said.

From 5% to 75%

The programme involved the formation of village education committees to take the ownership of State schools, training of teachers in a child-friendly way and rewriting the textbooks and publishing them for Ladakh. “As a result, the pass percentage in Class X rose from a dismissal 5% to 55% in seven years and is now 75%.”

For students who failed their exams, he founded the SECMOL Alternatives School near Leh. The students are provided with a creative and supportive environment in school. “Students who failed have excelled in their chosen area and risen to become entrepreneurs, filmmakers, teachers and politicians as well,” he said.

Dr. Wangchuk said he also teaches innovation at the alternative school, where he and his students designed and built a solar panel-heated building that is low-cost, made of earth, but maintains 15 degrees Celsius even when the outside temperature is -15 degrees Celsius in Ladakhi winters.

Due to fast melting glaciers, Ladakh’s residents have been faced with a water crisis and flooding. “I invented the Ice Stupa artificial glacier, which stores waste stream waters in winter in the form of giant ice cones or stupas and releases the water in late spring as they melt just when farmers need water,” Dr. Wangchuk said.

Living simply

The reformist, who has stopped ironing his clothes, said the move ensured that the electricity saved, could power four rural households. “In Ladakh, we do not need development and industrialisation, unlike other cities. The region needs a more harmonious and sustainable approach that can go for a much longer time without exploiting the environment,” Dr. Wangchuk said.

He has also started a movement called ‘I Live Simply Movement’ wherein one takes a pledge to say stop ironing clothes, start bicycling and choose trains over aeroplanes. “The planet does not need money, it needs behavioural change.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/teach-students-what-they-love-dr-wangchuk/article30610603.ece
435,2020/01/21,Man booked for beating up teenage daughter,"The Agripada police have booked a 51-year-old man for allegedly beating his daughter and leaving her with severe injuries in the early hours of Monday. The police said the accused has gone absconding after his daughter filed a complaint.

According to the police, the victim, Yusrat Ansari (17), lived with her parents and younger brother on 2nd Sakli Street in Agripada.

Officers said she was left with severe eye injuries and a partially broken tooth after the brutal assault.

Senior police inspector Savlaram Agavane said, “At 12.30 a.m. on Monday, Yusrat had an argument with her three-year-old brother and hit him. When the boy started crying, Nehal Ahmed Ansari (51), who was taking a bath, stepped out of the bathroom and started assaulting Yusrat.”

The police said Yusrat then rushed to Nair hospital for treatment. At 2.30 a.m., she reached the police station and filed a complaint against her father.

“After Yusrat filed the complaint, we visited her residence in Agripada. However, Mr. Ansari had fled by then. We are now searching for him,” police sub-inspector Sagar Parkale said.

Yusrat is a Class Xll student of Maharashtra College and is due to appear for her board examination.

436,2020/01/21,"‘Students should push towards brilliance, question opportunities’","According to Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay director Subhasis Chaudhuri, the cost of university education in India was cheap, despite which there was a demand from certain section of students in the country for a lower fee structure.

Dr. Chaudhuri was speaking at Xenith’20 organised by St. Xavier’s College’s Information and Technology department last week. Referring to the demands of students of Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jadavpur University, he said, “In India education is cheap, there is no tuition fee, if you go to the U.S., any kind of education costs $50,000 a year. Here, students are demanding education at a rate at which it is difficult to even afford a cup of coffee today.”

Dr. Chaudhuri said in India, education was vital to the growing economy. “Almost 1.5 crore teachers are employed through it and several other subsidiary businesses like university canteens and stationery shops also rely on educational institutions. They are in themselves, a functioning business,” he said.

Speaking on the topic ‘Higher Education: Perspective of an Administrator’, Dr. Chaudhuri said it was a known fact that money is required to maintain educational set-ups and their quality of teaching. “If one is paying a private college (to study), the children must receive quality education because that is their right.”

Dr. Chaudhuri observed that education opportunities were vast in the present day. “From massive open online courses to alternatives for student loans in countries like the U.S., education is no longer restricted to classrooms,” he said.

According to him, good education requires someone to pay for it. “Students should push towards brilliance, which is possible only when they constantly question the opportunities being vested on to them. In the U.S., students work with their universities for their education pay the college back once they are employed. Here, they do not even rely on student loans.”

Dr. Chaudhuri said similar policies existed in Australia, where the government lets the students choose colleges and the government aids their education. “These are great initiatives. The students pay back when they start earning,” he said.

The IIT-B director also spoke about the reduction in barriers and the ongoing debate about the need of a higher education. “The society creates unofficial deadlines but however it is surely, a personal choice as to what one deems as necessary… the presence of knowledge liberates oneself from one’s inner bondage. Education is the manifestation of perfection,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lafujl/article30610535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bmMr-Subhasis-Chaudhuri,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/students-should-push-towards-brilliance-question-opportunities/article30610536.ece

438,2020/01/21,BMC picks contractor for Mahalaxmi ROBs,"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has finally appointed a contractor to build two rail overbridges (ROBs) at Mahalaxmi that will take the load off the existing bridge. A proposal to build the two bridges — in the planning stage for five years — at a cost of around ₹745 crore will be placed before the BMC standing committee this week.

The existing ROB at Mahalaxmi station is almost 100 years old and dilapidated. The Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, had recommended reducing its load.

Since the BMC cannot pull the bridge down without an alternative, it undertook repairs and planned two new ROBs at Mahalaxmi station: one from Dr. E. Moses Road (Worli Naka) to Saat Rasta and another from Saat Rasta to Keshavrao Khadye Marg (towards Haji Ali). Together, they are supposed to ease traffic at Saat Rasta junction and Mahalaxmi station.

The second ROB will be a cable-stayed bridge — touted as the city’s first — as it will pass over railway tracks and cannot have pillars. Western Railway (WR) wanted the BMC to construct the entire bridge while the civic body insisted WR construct the portion in its jurisdiction. Now, the BMC will be constructing the entire stretch with relevant relevant permissions from WR and an overseeing consultant.

“As the existing ROB is the only link between Worli and the Tardeo/Haji Ali area [and has] completed its design life, it is necessary to connect the missing links of Dr. E. Moses Road and Keshavrao Khadye Marg to have better connectivity to Saat Rasta, Byculla area [to the east of the tracks] and Tardeo area on the west side,” the tender document read.

The ROB on Dr. E. Moses Road will be 639 metres long, while the one on Khadye Marg will be 803 metres long, and both will have four lanes. The latter will be cable-stayed at a height of 62 metre. Together, they will cost ₹745 crore, including consultants’ fees, and will take at least three years to be built. The ROBs are recommended in the Comprehensive Mobility Plan and proposed in the Development Plan 2034 as well.

Additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal said, “There was a long-pending demand to construct these bridges. We have finally completed the entire tendering process in four months and if the standing committee approves it, bhoomipujan can be done on January 26. Once these bridges are constructed, we will consider making the existing Mahalaxmi bridge a pedestrian-only zone.”

Sources said Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will perform the bhoomipujan on Republic Day.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4zqgek/article30610486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMMahalaxmi-Mapcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-picks-contractor-for-mahalaxmi-robs/article30610487.ece
439,2020/01/21,"Mumbai Marathon: stroke, heart attack patients stable","A 51-year-old runner who suffered a stroke and a 47-year-old runner who had a heart attack during the Tata Mumbai Marathon on Sunday are stable, said doctors. Both the runners were admitted to Bombay Hospital in Marine Lines where they are undergoing treatment.

Consultant physician Dr. Gautam Bhansali, who is treating the stroke patient, Sanjay Bafna, said he was brought to hospital within the golden hour, which is crucial for stroke treatment.

“We immediately carried out investigations and put him on clot-dissolving medication,” said Dr. Bhansali. The patient is in the intensive care unit, but in a stable condition. “He is talking and eating as well. Initially, he had some difficulty with speech but it has improved,” he said. The patient will be discharged in a day or two.

According to Dr. Bhansali, Mr. Bafna complained of discomfort after finishing the 21-km half marathon on Sunday. “He is a regular runner,” Dr. Bhansali said.

The second patient, Himanshu Thakkar, had a heart attack and doctors at Bombay Hospital carried out an angioplasty.

Medical experts say all runners should undergo a thorough check-up before participating in a race. “Patients often give up practising and training and then develop discomfort during the marathon,” said Dr. Bhansali. He has advised people not to participate in runs of over 10 km if they are not regularly training for them.

Gajanan Maljalkar, a 64-year-old runner, had died of a cardiac arrest on Sunday. The resident of Nallasopara had collapsed after crossing the 4-km mark for senior citizens. He was rushed to Bombay Hospital, but was declared dead on arrival.

440,2020/01/21,City to get firefighting bikes to reach inaccessible disaster sites,"The Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) has invited bids for procuring 24 fire bikes, which will manoeuvre narrow lanes and become first respondents during firefighting operations.

The bikes will be fitted with a 40-litre water tank, a pump, a high-pressure hose reel, siren and a GPS system. The MFB wants to use these bikes to cut down on response time owing to increased traffic.

Every year, several incidents of fire or building collapse occur in congested areas such as Chira Bazaar, Kalbadevi, Pydhonie, Dongri, Nagpada, Kamathipura, Kurla, Bandra’s Nargis Dutt Nagar, Garibnagar, Juhu Gully, Malvani and Dharavi. During such calls, fire engines and jumbo tankers may have to be parked on the main road, far from the site, and carry hose lines. This often becomes a challenge.

Besides, the fire brigade’s response time to a fire call in the island city is 15 to 20 minutes while in the suburbs, it is 20 to 25 minutes, primarily because of heavy traffic jams. This means a small fire may become bigger till the fire engines get to the site. The MFB already has quick response vehicles and mini fire engines but it wants to cut down its response time further.

“Worldwide, countries are trying to have fire bikes to ensure they are first respondents to a call. Singapore has such bikes. Since the fire bikes we are looking at will have a water tank capacity of 40 litres and will throw water at a rate of eight litres per minute, they can hold off the fire for five minutes. Then, the tank can be filled again using water from a source nearby. Even if they hold fort for 10 minutes using their 100-feet-long hose, by then, the fire engines will have arrived,” a senior fire brigade officer said. Besides, it will ensure a minor fire does not become major.

The fire brigade had decided to procure the bikes several years ago, but finally invited bids on January 1 for procuring them at a cost of ₹3 crore. The MFB has given specific instructions about the engines’ capacity and make, among other things. It will also comprise a fog or jet gun to create a water mist, and a siren-cum-announcement system, GPS system integrated with command and control system of the fire brigade, and two extinguishers. One bike will be stationed in each ward.

Currently, there is a team of seven firemen with each fire engine. Two will be stationed on fire bikes while five will be on the engines during a call. The bikes will be of the ‘off-roader’ variety for better mobility. Thane, Vasai-Virar and many other fire brigades have fire bikes but they are registered as regular bikes retrofitted with equipment. Instead, MFB is trying to get these bikes legally registered as fire bikes with the Regional Transport Office.

The MFB also has a firefighting robot that has come in handy in a few situations so far, including the fire at MTNL building in Bandra.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ps80ud/article30610444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMFIRE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/city-to-get-firefighting-bikes-to-reach-inaccessible-disaster-sites/article30610445.ece
441,2020/01/21,248% rise in cyber crime complaints,"Online fraud topped the list as complaints of cyber crime in Navi Mumbai witnessed a 248% rise in 2019.

Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar said, “Cyber fraud is a social problem. It can be tackled only with awareness and education. We have circulated pamphlets, booklets and messages through banks asking people to be alert. Detecting such cases in the virtual world is challenging as many platforms and websites that commit fraud are based abroad.”

In 2019, of the 417 complaints received, 354 were disposed of. In 2018, all 120 complaints were disposed of. Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Pravinkumar Patil said, “Many complaints were disposed of after fraudulent transactions were reversed by the bank. However, reversal is possible only if the complainant approaches us immediately and the accused has not withdrawn the money.”

Mr. Patil said the police help victims track the accused when their social media accounts have been hacked. “If the culprit turns out to be an acquaintance, the victim takes back the complaint. Victims also take back complaints when we block fake accounts opened in their name. Complaints that need further investigation are disposed of and transferred to the local police stations.”

Last year, 62 FIRs were registered, of which 23 were based on complaints of cheating due to sharing of one-time passwords. Collectively, such cases caused victims a loss of ₹37.36 lakh, while the total loss recorded in cyber crime complaints was ₹2.42 crore.

442,2020/01/21,Bombay HC lawyers read Preamble outside court,"Lawyers practising at the Bombay High Court on Monday gathered outside the court to read the Preamble to the Constitution as a mark of protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Around 70 lawyers walked out of the court around 2 p.m. and gathered just outside the gate for the protest. The lawyers said the CAA and NRC are discriminatory towards a section of society and, as guardians of the law, they do not support the legislations.

“All the articles in our Constitution can be amended, but the Preamble is the only part that cannot. Speaking against the government does not mean that an individual is anti-national. There is a judgement by the HC that says so,” advocate Ashraf Ahmed Sheikh said.

He said the CAA is discriminatory in two ways. “Firstly, it violates Article 14 of the Constitution, which says nobody should be denied equality before the law. Secondly, it also violates Article 15, which prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth,” he said.

Others said the protest was a way of expressing that the lawyers stand with the protesting masses. They said rather than spending crores of rupees on such laws, the government can use the same money for the betterment of the economy, providing jobs and women’s emancipation.

“We don’t have any problem if our brothers and sisters who are persecuted in the neighbouring nations are called to India. But when the government restricts a particular community from a law, it is a clear case of discrimination. By reading the Preamble, we did not protest against the government, but made a note that the Constitution and Preamble are still intact. People should not be afraid of losing their citizenship in their own country,” advocate Mubin Solkar said.

Advocate Fareha Rizvi added, “When Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar framed our Constitution, it did not discriminate among people. If we wanted to leave the country, we would have left in 1947. After 72 years of Independence, the government suddenly says that we are not Indians.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kg60ke/article30610400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bm-Lawyers,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-lawyers-read-preamble-outside-court/article30610402.ece
443,2020/01/21,FIR against Uran Municipal Council for dumping waste in mangroves,"Following a complaint from the revenue department, an FIR has been filed against the Uran Municipal Council (UMC) for dumping garbage and sewage in mangroves.

Panvel Divisional Commissioner Shivaji Daund, chairman of the Bombay High Court-appointed Mangrove Protection and Conservation Committee, had directed sub-divisional officer Dattatyreya Nawle to carry out an inspection of the dumping ground at Bori Pakhadi on Sunday.

Mr. Nawle said, “The tehsildar of Uran and his team conducted the survey and found that the mangroves had been destroyed.” Based on a complaint by talathi Vinay Chintaman Patil, the Uran police filed an FIR under the Maharashtra Environment Protection Act, 1986. “No officer or department has been named in the FIR. We are investigating the role of the UMC in the case,” said senior police inspector Jagdish Kulkarni.

B.N. Kumar, director, NatConnect Foundation, said, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation had also raised a red flag as the dumping yard is dangerously close to one of its valve stations.

Nandakumar Pawar, head of the Shri Ekvira Aai Pratishtan, said the mangrove committee had directed the district collector and the City and Industrial Development Corporation to shift the dumping yard on December 9. “However, no action was taken and the UMC contractors continued to dispose of garbage and sewage in the mangroves.”

Mr. Kumar said the UMC hasn’t budged despite teams from the revenue and forest departments conducting two joint surveys and confirming that the mangroves had been destroyed.

He said, “Even sewage is discharged into the mangroves with utter disregard for the environment and public health. Fed up with the apathy of officials, residents of the area, mostly women, filed 80 identical complaints against civic officials on Saturday after taking out a protest march to the tehsildar’s office under the leadership of Uran Yuva.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fir-against-uran-municipal-council-for-dumping-waste-in-mangroves/article30610385.ece
444,2020/01/21,Lost three-year-old reunited with parents within two hours,"A three-year-old girl on a visit to the city from Tamil Nadu, who was separated from her parents in Sion Koliwada, was reunited with them within two hours by the Antop Hill police on Monday.

According to police officials, Ritika Devendra was found standing alone and crying near Sion flyover by police sub-inspector Nitin Zade, who was on patrol duty around 11 a.m. on Monday.

Spotted crying

“Me and my team asked her what was wrong, but Ritika was very disturbed could not say anything. We calmed her down, bought her some sweets and took her to the police station so that we could speak to her a length,” Mr. Zade said.

At the police station, Mr. Zade once again made patient inquiries with the girl and was able to learn her name, her mother’s name — Shreedevi — and that she had come with her parents from Tamil Nadu to attend a wedding.

Tracing parents

“Based on this information, we started finding out if there were any weddings taking place in the area and learnt of an engagement party at KD Gaikwad Nagar in Sion. The venue is half an hour’s distance away from where we spotted Ritika and we decided to start there,” Mr. Zade said.

At the venue, the police ascertained that a couple, Thangavel and Shreedevi Devendra, had been among the guests and had got separated from their daughter. The couple, though, was not at the venue but was out looking for the girl.

The police team set out in the vicinity to look for the parents. “We found them in a short while not far from the venue, as Ritika herself saw her mother and called out to her. She was handed over to her parents,” Mr. Zade said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/el2ett/article30610372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bmmissing-girl,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lost-three-year-old-reunited-with-parents-within-two-hours/article30610373.ece

447,2020/01/21,Two-wheeled tempters,"It has been four weeks since Jinali Haria moved to Bengaluru. During her first week here, she availed public transport. She had to change two buses and it took about an hour to reach office. In the third week, seeing no sense in travelling this way, Jinali listened to photographer, web programmer and eco-warrior, Mayank Rungta’s advice: cycle to work. When she starting cycling to work, her commute time was reduced from an hour to 20 minutes/ half hour. “I plan my day well. I leave by 8.30 or 9 am. Any later than that and the traffic gets crazy.” Jinali has discovered short cuts to get to work. “I take ‘silent lanes’ where there is not much traffic.”

Since 2017, software professional Chidambaran Subramanian (46), has been cycling to work, on his KHS Flite 350, from JP Nagar to Whitefield. A commute that would take close to two hours (or more, factoring in traffic), takes Chidambaran an hour. “I have been cycling for years,” he says.

It is not all hunky-dory when it comes to cycling in the city, though. Ask Mayank, an avid cycler. He has conducted 60 workshops with corporates on the importance of cycling. “I work remotely now. It has been a long time since I have cycled and am grateful that I don’t have to cycle that much.” Mayank says he is not a cynic, he is just practical. “Earlier we had to face dust, pollution and traffic. These days we face issues such as burning lakes and crazy amounts of plastic being burnt. It is hazardous to us.” He agrees, though, that more people are becoming aware of cycling. “The membership of the Bangalore Bikers Group has grown to 10,000 plus members today.” But he adds: “I prefer a tree-lined park over just another cycle track.”

Jinali agrees with Mayank and says: “It is hazardous. I ensure I have all my gear, including a pollution mask. Also I have faced at least two scary experiences with motorists, including one who almost drove into me. That is why cyclists have to always be alert.”

Data scientist Sandeep Tammu (27) cycled to work for a year and a half. “My workplace was just four kilometres away. It took me 45 to 50 minutes to reach by public transport or cab. There were days when it would take a lot of time to get a cab. But when I cycles, it took me 20 minutes.”

Though now, Sandeep, does not cycle to work as much as he used to. “The main thing that bothered me is safety at night. You have to be careful to see all the cars. Sometimes cars overtake trucks and swerve towards the left and may miss seeing the cyclist.”

Chidambaran, on the other hand, says it all about getting used to traffic. “You need to be adept in a certain mode of cycling. I make sure there is a gap between me and the left hand side of the road. As cyclists we are faster than others.” He adds: “The Cycling-to-Work group was started by Shilpi Sahu. “Every Friday at 8 am we gather at the Iblur Junction and go towards Marathahalli.” Shamala Kittane, who builds bicyle wheels for Haappyearth.in, over the weekends, and works at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, has been cycling to work for 10 years. She cycles 15 kilometres to her workplace and it takes her about an hour to reach. She says that cycling has got worse because of blocking of roads for construction. “Pollution has increased. But I have seen people make way.” She adds that cycling needs stamina. “I have built my stamina over 10 years. I also run and exercise so I am fit and wear a mask all the time.”

Rohan Kini started Bums on the Saddle, a biking company, because he too is a cycling enthusiast. “Bangalore is a good city to cycle in because the weather is great.” He agrees that cycling has increased over the years. “I have been cycling for 12 years. People are now more aware they need to be safe. We go to companies to raise awareness on cycling to work. A lot of companies are supporting it now.” He says the primary reason for cycling is that it is a lot of fun. “You end up taking smaller and faster routes. Once you start enjoying it, everything else falls in place. A good bike costs about ₹1 lakh or ₹2 lakhs, the most expensive bike we have sold is ₹10 lakhs. But people recover the cost. If you are on a good product 20 kilometres is not really that big a deal.”

Satya Sankaran, who is Bengaluru’s first Bicycle Mayor, says that ever since October 2018, there has been an increase in the number of people who have registered on cycleto.work. “Approximately, 1,852 people have registered.” He, however, admits there needs to be many more cycle tracks. As for motorists’ attitudes towards cyclists he says: “We conducted Ride for Safety in June 2019 to raise awareness.” He concludes with the punchline: “Cycling is the future of mobility.”",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/6d89sl/article30616135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bgmchidambaranjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/two-wheeled-tempters/article30616139.ece
448,2020/01/21,Steps to maintain your bike’s chain,"A well-maintained chain can improve a bike’s performance quite significantly. And there is a huge difference between a chain that hasn’t been maintained and one that has been, as it is the chain that sends power to the rear wheel of your motorcycle. It is also one of the most common maintenance measures that is overlooked in India. However, the good news is that it is not very difficult to do it yourself.

1. Jack up your motorcycle

Find a clean, flat surface to get your motorcycle up on the paddock stand or its main stand. A clean area is a good place to begin with, so you don’t end up dirtying the motorcycle and yourself completely. And since we will be using water, see to it that there is good drainage. This is also a good time to arrange and place your tools at a higher surface or away from the chain area.

2. Wash the chain

Motorcycle chains are filthy, and more so in countries like ours, where the roads aren’t very clean. Open chains attract dirt and dust easily because of their oily surface and position on the motorcycle. This is a big reason why most commuter motorcycles in India come with enclosed chain covers. However, with the dawn of sportier commuters and new sports bike introductions, open chains are a common sight. These get dirty really quickly, and they need a good wash quite often. Water will help get as much surface dirt off as possible and also loosen up the remaining sludge on the chain.

3. Clean the chain

Like with most things, preparation is key, and washing the chain is only the first step; it needs a thorough cleaning. To begin, spray it with a chain cleaner or WD-40. The use of WD-40, however, is contested, as some believe that it can cause damage to the delicate O-rings in the chain over prolonged use. Make sure to rotate the wheel while spraying it, to get it on every link of the chain. Give it a few minutes to soak in and then scrub hard with a toothbrush or chain-cleaning brush. Make sure you clean the brush from time to time. Lastly, wipe down the entire chain with a rag and make sure the chain has lost its sludgy black colour and gone to its original shiny metallic colour.

4. Oil the chain

The last and most rewarding step is to oil the chain with a motorcycle chain lubricant. Use the nozzle on the spray can, and oil each link of the chain. Spray it in short bursts so that it doesn’t get on other areas which would be hard to clean. Be careful not to over-lube and ensure you don’t get any lube on the rear tyre. A handy tip is to hold a piece of cardboard behind the chain to keep the overspray in control.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/7995g1/article30615850.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bgmApplyingChainCleanerJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/steps-to-maintain-your-bikes-chain/article30615854.ece
449,2020/01/21,Kia Carnival review: It’s Carnival time,"Before we get into the thick of this review, you should know that the Kia Carnival is not a direct rival to the Toyota Innova Crysta. The Carnival is a larger, more powerful and premium MPV, whose prices will start where the Innova range tops off. In a sense, Kia’s MPV is meant for buyers who want something luxurious, but have had to settle for an Innova for lack of alternatives.

Buyers will have the option of choosing between seven (2+2+3 layout), eight (2+3+3 layout) and nine seats (a four-row 2+2+2+3 layout). The seven-seater will be available in all three trims (Premium, Prestige and Limousine), with the eight- and nine-seat versions available in Premium and Prestige, respectively. There is only one engine-gearbox combination — a 2.2-litre BS-VI diesel mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission.

The Carnival’s silhouette is traditional MPV, but the imposing grille, large headlamps, unique ice-cube-like fog lights and a skid plate up front add a premium feel. While the massive 3,060mm wheelbase remains a focal point, the pronounced shoulder line, pinched effect for the third-row windows and sleek 18-inch alloys uplift its profile. The long rear overhang leads into an upright tail that is embellished with a roof spoiler, smart-looking tail-lamps and a skid plate. Importantly, unlike the rear-wheel-drive, ladder-frame Innova, the Carnival uses a space-efficient front-wheel-drive monocoque construction.

There is considerable room inside, accentuated by the large windshield and glasshouse. Fit and finish are German-car good. The high-set, 8.0-inch touchscreen and centre console buttons are easy to reach and access. Front-seat comfort is also good; and occupants will find it easy to get in and out.

Access to the rear section is via standard powered sliding doors, operated via door handles, overhead controls (up front) or the key fob. While the doors open wide, getting to the rear rows entails a bit of a climb. The grab handle on the B-pillar does help, but older occupants won’t find it the easiest ingress.

The reclinable middle-row captain’s seats on the seven-seat Limousine can be slid back to maximise legroom, and features fold-out leg rests. The Nappa leather-upholstered seats are plush and there are also two 10.1-inch rear touchscreens with screen mirroring, HDMI and internet (via mobile hotspot). A 220V two-pin plug point at the rear console (exclusive to the India-spec model) makes it possible to connect larger devices too.

While it is a genuinely luxurious experience, with the leg rests at full extension, our feet inevitably touched the seats in front. This does highlight the absence of a mechanism that allows the rear passenger to slide the front seats forward.

Access to the third and/or fourth row seats depends on the version. Seven- and/or eight-seat Premium and Prestige variants get ‘stand-up’ second-row seats that open up to create a large cavity you can walk through. The nine-seat Prestiges and the seven-seat Limousine trims require rear-seat occupants to walk to their seats via the central passageway.

The Limousine variant’s third row gets sliding and recline functions. However, the seating position is knees-up, and headroom is just adequate. However, there’s enough shoulder room for three average-sized adults to sit in relative comfort.

With all seats in place and the third row at its rearmost, the seven-seater can comfortably hold two large suitcases. More space can be created by either sliding the seats forward and/or folding the flat-folding third-row seat.

In the nine-seater, the second- and third-row captain’s chairs get reclinable backrests, adjustable armrests, and a sliding function. The third-row seating position is a bit too knees-up and the cramped fourth row is best for occasional use. With all four rows up, there is virtually no space for luggage, although folding the single-piece last row does make enough space.

The Carnival scores well on in-cabin storage — the main glovebox is supplemented by a small storage bay, door pockets, and storage under the centre armrest. There are cupholders for each of the seats at the back, as well as a 12V outlet in the boot.

The Carnival is quite well-kitted; even base trims come with dual airbags, rear parking sensors, a rear-view camera, auto-projector headlights, cruise control, three-zone climate control, keyless entry and a 8.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.

The Prestige trim adds LED lights, a powered tailgate and a host of safety features, while the fully-loaded variant gets Nappa-leather upholstery, a rear-seat entertainment system, a powered driver’s seat, ventilated seats, on-board navigation, an eight-speaker Harman Kardon sound system, and Kia’s UVO connected tech with 37 features. Also unique to the Limousine is an on-board air purifier.

Power comes from an easy-going 2.2-litre, four-cylinder, turbo-diesel making 200hp and 440Nm of torque. Still, it’s not punchy. The 8-speed torque converter auto isn’t lightning quick either, as there’s a mild pause in kickdown acceleration. However, the engine and gearbox are well in tune for everyday use. The tyres help to filter out sharp edges and ruts.

In terms of high-speed manners, it drives with confidence and you get a good sense of control at the wheel. That said, it’s not meant for quick direction changes, as there’s a lot of MPV behind the driver.

On wavy surfaces, you’ll also note the softness to its suspension setup at the rear. The ride isn’t exactly floaty, but rear passengers will move around. On the plus side, low-speed bump absorption is really good.

Its size could also be a point of contention in congested cities. A 5.8m turning radius means manoeuvring into a tight parking spot isn’t the easiest. The steering is easy enough to twirl though.

Kia will announce the Carnival prices at Auto Expo 2020 in early February — expect an aggressive price tag in the ₹26-35 lakh (estimated, ex-showroom) band.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/aansxj/article30615743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22MP-Kia-Carnival-6,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/its-carnival-time/article30615745.ece
450,2020/01/21,"Govt. won't allow hydrocarbon projects in U.T. at any cost, says Puducherry CM","Taking strong exception to Centre’s decision to grant permission for hydrocarbon exploration projects in Puducherry and Karaikal regions without getting the consent of the territorial administration, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Tuesday said his government would not allow the projects to take off “at any cost” as they would affect the livelihood of farmers and fishermen.

“If needed, we ourselves will protest against the hydrocarbon projects in the Union Territory. The territory is already under threat due to sea water intrusion and the deep drilling for extracting hydrocarbon will further cause environmental degradation. The project will not be allowed at any cost,” he said, addressing a press conference along with Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare R. Kamalakannan. He accused the Centre of working as an agent of the Vedanta Group.

Questioning the intention of the Union Government in choosing Puducherry and Tamil Nadu for exploration, the Chief Minister sought to know from the Centre why it did not include North Indian States for such a project.

Recalling his letters to the Union Home Minister and Minister for Petroleum informing them of his government’s decision not to implement the hydrocarbon project, Mr. Narayanasamy said the Centre’s decision to go ahead with the project without getting the clearance of his government was an infringement on the rights of States.

The Chief Minister said he received a communication from the Centre two days ago stating that the Vedanta Group had been given permission to carry out hydrocarbon exploration in a 2 sq km area in Bahour and 39 sq km in Karaikal. Besides, the group would carry out off-shore drilling in 4,047 sq km of the Puducherry and Tamil Nadu coast, the Chief Minister said.

The order by the Centre was against federal concepts, he said adding that the decision to amend the Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2006 was done with the sole intention not to have the mandatory public hearing for such major projects. “Now, they don’t need to get environmental clearance or elicit views of public on hydrocarbon projects. They (Centre) are trying to thrust their views and decisions on the people. It once again shows the autocratic style of functioning of Union Government,” he said.

The Legislative Assembly had passed a resolution in 2019 against implementing the project and the government would continue to oppose the project, the Chief Minister said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/uoh1t0/article30614350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21JANTH-CMPRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/centre-working-as-an-agent-of-vedanta-group-says-puducherry-chief-minister/article30614351.ece

Inaugurating the seven-day tour of Puducherry by 200 youth from the Naxal-hit tribal districts of Bijapur, Sukma, Bastar and Dantewada in Chhattisgarh as part of the Tribal Youth Exchange Programme, the Lt. Governor said once the youth of the country start thinking about a secure India, violence of all kinds will stop.

“No one in the neighbourhood will get involved in violence or wrongdoings. Women will not get sexually abused. The security of the country remains in the hands of youth,” she said.

Stating that Swachhata was a movement, Ms. Bedi said it was not confined to a political party or region. “It is a movement for all in the country,” she said.

Urging tribal youth to give utmost importance to cleanliness, Ms. Bedi said people should utilise the financial assistance provided by the Centre to construct toilets. They should also help create awareness among relatives and the community to make the country open defecation free, she added.

The Lt. Governor stressed on the need to create a healthy environment for a better future. She also stressed upon compassion, service to the society and better education for building a strong and secure country.

Parliamentary secretary to the Chief Minister K. Lakshminarayanan. in his address, said the youth should come forward to develop the country. Social service as a habit will help youngsters from getting diverted to other activities, he said.

453,2020/01/21,Kerala first State to form rules for brain death declaration,"Nearly 25 years after the Transplantation of Human Organs Act (THOA) 1994 was framed in India, Kerala has become the first State to formulate well-defined clinical protocols for brain death certification in the country.

In a path-breaking step, Kerala government has de-linked the process of brain death declaration from organ donation process and has now issued a GO, setting forth parameters for brain death certification in ICUs and how clinicians should proceed once brain death has been confirmed.

Putting an end to an ethical dilemma that clinicians have been facing for long, the new GO says that once a patient has been pronounced brain-dead as per the protocol, all treatment, including cardio-respiratory support should be discontinued.

“We are setting forth an evidence-based model for the entire country on brain death declaration, which will eventually pave the way for a fool-proof deceased donor organ donation programme. The new GO should guide all clinicians in pronouncing brain death in ICUs and how to move forward. Clinicians can now take charge in ICUs, without any fear of future litigation, to terminate all life support if the patient is certified brain-dead, rather than leave the decision to the traumatised family. It is a responsibility that they have to fulfill, keeping in mind the dignity of the deceased,” Rajan Khobragade, Principal Secretary (Health), said.

“The attempt is to make brain death diagnosis and certification a standard of care in all ICUs, so that the brain-dead are not left hooked to life support unnecessarily, which would result in extending the trauma of the family, providing them false hope, and in the end, burdening them with huge hospital bills. Maintaining a brain-dead patient on ventilator in the ICU requires immense resources, which are better used to save the life of a salvageable patient. But till now, there was no clarity because law did not say that life support can be withdrawn if a patient is brain-dead,” said Noble Gracious, Nodal Officer, Kerala Network for Organ Sharing.

Over the past one year or more, the government had been doing a series of consultations with neurologists, critical care specialists and legal experts on developing parameters for universal brain death certification so that the process can be separated from organ donation and made a part of quality care norms and standard ICU practice.

In India, brain death has been defined only in connection with organ donation, in the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994. The result has been that the public as well as the clinicians perceive brain death certification as a procedure that is done solely to aid organ donation. Doctors had no clarity on what they should do if, after brain death certification, the family refused the option of organ donation.

This confusion had given rise to allegations that hospitals were “staging” brain deaths to allow organ donation to take place, seriously eroding public’s trust in Mrithasanjeevani, the State-run deceased organ donation programme.

In a statement here, Mr. Chandy said the Governor should be prepared to function by fully encompassing the limitations that his post held. He said it would be difficult to accept any moves on the part of the Governor to control or bridle a democratically elected government. He hoped that the Governor would realise the strong resentment of the people of Kerala on this issue and be prepared to avoid open confrontation.

Legal solution

457,2020/01/21,Kerala start-up to launch streaming platform soon,"In a video streaming market populated by giants, a humble start-up with Keralites at the helm is all set to launch one such platform which promises to provide content for free to its users

. Titled 'Mainstream TV', its focus is entirely on content in Malayalam, ranging from movies to web series to travel shows and stand-up comedy shows.

The past couple of years have been witness to the gaining popularity of Over-the-top (OTT) platforms, which deliver film and TV content through the internet, without requiring users to subscribe to a traditional cable television service.

But, much of the content has remained paid. ‘Mainstream TV,’ set up by a group of young professionals experienced in visual media, aims at nurturing local content creators. “Many small-time content creators, who have unique material on their hands, find it hard to approach or even afford the big players. We are thus aiming to provide a democratic space, where anyone can come in. Also, since all of us belong to Kerala, although our company is based in Bengaluru, we do have a much better understanding of the changing tastes of the local market. Once we attain enough growth, we plan to turn this even into a releasing platform for movies,” says S.Shiva, one of the founders of Mainstream TV.

Though the team is in the process of launching the platform to the public in a few days time, they have already made available the mobile android application as well and in App store on a pilot basis.

An application will soon be made available for Smart TVs, while it will also be incorporated into the Firestick.

Currently they have a library of around 700 Malayalam movies and around 3,000 short videos, with more being acquired. But their main focus will be on their own content, which includes a web-series as well as some short format content, which includes a weekly stand-up comedy show based on the contemporary events.

As they are a free service, they plan to generate revenues from advertisements, in the model followed by streaming services like YouTube.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kerala-start-up-to-launch-streaming-platform-soon/article30610349.ece
458,2020/01/21,Thiruvananthapuram Corporation cracks down on parking space violators,"The city Corporation has begun a crackdown on commercial establishments which have converted their designated parking lots for other purposes and use up space on public roads for parking purposes.

In a joint inspection carried out by the town planning standing committee, traffic police officials, engineering and health wing officials, notices were served to the owners of 21 commercial establishments along the Kowdiar – Kuravankonam stretch, for various violations.

Chicken corner

According to officials who were part of the inspection team, in one of the restaurants at Kuravankonam, the designated underground parking area was used up to expand the restaurant, while in another one it was used to house the chicken grilling corner. Even in the few restaurants which had set aside some area for parking, the area was found to be grossly inadequate considering the number of customers they can accommodate.

The Kowdiar-Kuravankonam stretch has been experiencing traffic bottlenecks often in recent month owing to customers at the restaurants here parking on the roadside.

“Some of the buildings have two or three commercial establishments. So, we served notices to the owners of these buildings. They have been asked to produce the building plan approved by the Corporation. The owners can choose to restore the building as per the approved plan, else the Corporation will go ahead with steps including cancellation of the allotted number, which will then automatically lead to cancellation of the shop’s license,” said Town Planning Standing Committee Chairman Palayam Rajan.

The officials also noticed unauthorised extension work ongoing in six of the buildings, for which also notices were served. The owners of tea shops which had encroached into a part of the footpath in front of the shop have been asked to clear the pathway.

On Monday, the joint team will check the rest of the stretch till Pattom and also carry out similar checks along MG Road.

465,2020/01/21,High prices motivate farmers to raise onion in new areas,"TIRUCHI

Motivated by the good market price commanded by small onions, a section of farmers in the peripheries of Tiruchi and Karur districts on the Allithurai-Thogamalai road have took to cultivating the shallots.

Farmers of the region mainly depend upon rainfed for cultivation. They generally do not cultivate small onion due to difficulty in meeting the water requirements. However, a section of farmers have brought more than 200 acres under the onion cultivation this season. The red soil, which is considered as suitable for onion cultivation, has also played its roll in motivating the farmers to raise onion.

According to the farmers, the moisture content available in the soil keeps the crop in relatively good health. Since heavy rain was not good for onion crop particularly during bulb germination and bulb formation stage, the farmers began the cultivation process by mid December. The recharged ground water table in several villages on Somarasampettai-Kavalkaranpatti road due to steady of water in canals and sub canals in neighbouring Allithurai, Vayalur and Kuzhumani villages comes as handy for irrigation by using pumpsets.

“The onion prices continue to rule high. I do not generally raise onion during the current season. But, I have raised onion crop on my 20 cents of land with an idea of getting good price,” says P. Arumugam, a farmer near Thayanur on the outskirts of Tiruchi.

He said that the red soil was suitable for onion crop. But, there had been no assured source of water on the west of Thayanur and Adhavathur. Pump irrigation was the way out. Several farmers had established an understanding with those who had pump set irrigation to irrigate their rainfed crops, including onion.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/19730p/article30616926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY22ONION-APPLYINGFERTILIZERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/high-prices-motivate-farmers-to-raise-onion-in-new-areas/article30616927.ece

The State government has targeted to procure about 25 lakh tonnes of paddy from farmers through the direct purchase centres (DPCs) opened by the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation this year, Food Minister R. Kamaraj said on Tuesday.

Speaking to reporters in Tiruvarur after inspecting various DPCs in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts, Mr.Kamaraj said all necessary steps have been taken to procure paddy from farmers in their respective areas. Based on a demand put forth by farmers representatives, the procurement limit at a DPC has been increased from 800 to 1000 bags a day.

Earlier, speaking at a consultative meeting with officials and farmers representatives in Thanjavur, Mr.Kamaraj said during 2018-19, about 19.10 lakh tonnes of paddy was procured from over 5.06 lakh farmers through 1,766 DPCs. About ₹3,487 crore was disbursed to the farmers.

During the current year, 87,493 tonnes of paddy has been procured so far through 455 DPCs in the delta region and 63 in the non-delta areas. Collectors have been empowered to open DPCs wherever necessary based on demand. So far, ₹ 6 crore has been disbursed as incentive to farmers.

467,2020/01/21,Move to hold public exams for class V and VIII rankles teachers,"TIRUCHI

While there is a sigh of palpable relief among teachers of primary and upper primary schools after the latest announcement by the Education Minister T.A. Sengottaiyan that the public exam for levels V and VIII will be conducted in the respective institutions, they could barely conceal their disappointment over the government's decision to go ahead with the public exams despite reservations expressed from various quarters.

According to sources, the School Education Department was earlier exploring the scope for assigning examination centres within a one-km radius for primary schools with single-digit strengths at level V, and within three-km radius for upper primary schools at level VIII.

Teachers of the panchayat union schools with less student numbers were a worried lot since the burden of to and fro transport of students to the nearest school assigned as the examination centre would have fallen on them.

“It is not just about the money we need to spend. There are safety aspects. In the first place, we find it extremely difficult to convey to the students the concept of public examinations,” said a primary school teacher in Manapparai Panchayat Union requesting anonymity.

The students hardly understand the difference between the usual year-end examination and the public exam.

“It is we teachers who feel stressed,” another teacher said. “The announcement of the public exam rather late has unsettled the teachers and students alike. If the idea for public exam is to prepare the students well for better academic performance, the policy ought to be ideally implemented from the next academic year,” he said.

According to official sources, the School Education Department was almost on the verge of assigning centres and preparing duty charts for the teachers of primary and upper primary schools when the announcement was made by the Education Minister.

As per the time table released by the Directorate of Government exams, the exams for class V and VIII will begin on April 15 and 30 respectively. The exam beginning at 10.00 a.m. will be for a duration of two hours and fifteen minutes. The first fifteen minutes will be divided for reading the question papers for ten minutes and filling their details in the answer sheet for five minutes.

According to the order issued last September, a child failing in the examination will be given additional instruction and granted opportunity for re-examination within a period of two months from the date of declaration of results.

While schools can hold back children at levels V and VIII in case of failure in re-examination, expelling them will not be permitted, the order states.

“Instead, the government ought to have given sufficient time for teachers to prepare students for the challenge. It is still not too late for the government to push implementation of the policy to next academic year,” a headmaster said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/move-to-hold-public-exams-for-class-v-and-viii-rankles-teachers/article30616669.ece

On Monday, a demonstration on the hand-held brush cutter, which can be used for paddy harvest, was conducted by a private company.

The demonstration was held following demands put forward by a section of farmers led by Puliyur A.Nagarajan, president, Farmers Wing of the Tamil Maanila Congress, to the Agriculture Secretary and the Agricultural Engineering Department.

The brush cutters, costing about ₹30,000 would be extended to farmers with up to 50% subsidy. The brush cutters are used for clearing bushes or vegetation. But now they have found a new application in harvesting paddy, said Mr. Nagarajan.

The hand-held machines would be of much help to farmers whose fields cannot be accessed by the chain-type harvesters or those mounted on tyres. “In places such as Vayalur, there are many fields where the harvesters cannot enter. Given the shortage of farm labourers and rising costs, the hand held devices will by very useful for farmers during the harvest season,” Mr.Nagarajan said. He claimed that using the machines, a well trained labourer, can harvest paddy crop on an acre in a couple of hours.

When contacted, a senior Agricultural Engineering Department officer in the district said that the department was willing to extend subsidy to any number of machines. The machines are available with two companies and farmers can purchase them availing the subsidy, he said.

Thanking the Agriculture Secretary and the Chief Engineer of the Agricultural Engineering Department, Mr.Nagarajan appealed to them to extend the machines to team leaders of agricultural labourers, who are engaged in paddy harvest, at 100% subsidy so that more farmers can benefit.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/8unx8q/article30616622.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY22-BRUSHCUTTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/state-to-give-hand-held-paddy-harvesters-at-subsidised-rates/article30616623.ece
469,2020/01/21,CRS to inspect Thanjavur-Tiruvarur electrified stretch on Jan. 31,"TIRUCHI

With overhead electrification works completed in the Thanjavur – Tiruvarur broad section, the stretch is now set for mandatory inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Bengaluru. The Commissioner of Railway Safety will inspect the electrified Thanjavur – Tiruvarur section on January 31 by travelling on board a special train. The electrification works has been carried out by the Central Organisation For Railway Electrification (CORE).

A senior CORE official told The Hindu on Tuesday that the Commissioner of Railway Safety (CRS) would commence the inspection from Thanjavur Junction by travelling in a special train. He would be accompanied by top officials of the Southern Railway and Tiruchi Railway Division besides senior CORE officials.

The Commissioner of Railway Safety would examine all aspects relating to overhead electrification works in the nearly 55-km stretch from Thanjavur to Tiruvarur. He would conduct a speed trial run the same day from Tiruvarur to Thanjavur by travelling in the special train which would be hauled by an electric locomotive.

The speed trial run would be conducted at 90 km per hour which is the permitted speed in the Thanjavur – Tiruvarur single line section. The inspection by the Commissioner of Railway Safety comes after the CORE officials submitted relevant documents pertaining to completion of overhead electrification works in that stretch.

Only after obtaining statutory sanction from the Commissioner of Railway Safety would electric locomotive hauled trains be operated in the Thanjavur - Tiruvarur section. Presently, passenger and freight trains in the Thanjavur - Tiruvarur- Nagapattinam section were being hauled by diesel locomotive.

The Thanjavur - Tiruvarur electrification work is part of the Tiruchi - Thanjavur - Tiruvarur - Nagapattinam - Karaikal overhead electrification project being executed by the CORE at a cost of around ₹ 200 crore.

The CORE had already completed electrification in the double line stretch from Tiruchi to Thanjavur. The Commissioner of Railway Safety had already accorded mandatory sanction for operation of electric loco hauled passenger and freight trains in the Tiruchi - Thanjavur broad gauge section.

The CORE is simultaneously carrying out the electrification works in the final portion from Tiruvarur to Karaikal via Nagapattinam. The official said the project up to Karaikal was targeted for completion by March.

471,2020/01/21,Industries pin their hopes on RBI bailout package,"About 250 stressed engineering industries in Tiruchi region are staring at closure before the start of next fiscal if RBI does not consider their plea for a bailout package.

So far, nearly 40 units have closed down over the last few years due to implementation of SARFAESI (Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest) Act.

Implementation of the SARFAESI Act was temporarily stopped for 52 units after the Tamil Nadu Boilers Association and BHEL Small Industries Association (BHELSIA) made several representations to the Central and State governments calling for a halt to the legal proceedings.

Representatives of TNBA and BHELSIA have been emphasising that the State government has an important role to play in the revival initiative since hundreds of other ancillaries of BHEL, which are staying just afloat due to depleted conversion orders, are facing the heat.

“It is only a matter of time before they face eventual closure if the Centre and the State governments do not provide them backing in the form of bailout package. We expect Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to listen to our grievances and take ameliorative measures,” president of BHEL Small Industries Association (BHELSSIA) Rajappa Rajkumar said.

In anticipation of huge outsourcing orders from BHEL, the ancillaries took huge bank loans to expand capacities. A combined capacity for material conversion of seven tonnes was created. But in the present situation, conversion orders for only 200 tonnes have been outsourced, it is learnt.

The ancillary industries are no longer in a position to bargain conversion rates. Now, it is a case of survival of the fittest. For, industries that have created capabilities think it fit to keep the machinery in running condition even if it means making losses, industry sources said.

Some developments have infused hope for sustenance for the surviving industries as well as those looking at the revival path.

Earlier this month, the Central government promulgated an ordinance for amendment in the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) (MMDR) Act, 1957 and the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015 in order to ease auction of coal mines, allow FDI and enhance ease of doing business.

Henceforth, companies which do not possess any prior coal mining experience in India but are financially strong and/or have mining experience in other minerals or in other countries, can now participate in auction of coal/lignite blocks.

The Centre has also announced that state-run firms NTPC and BHEL are exploring recalibrating of turbines to enable them to shift to domestic coal from imported coal.

“We are also looking forward to executing orders for the railways and the defence sector. There is a dire need for early intervention by the Central and State governments for revival of hundreds of ailing fabrication industries,” Mr. Rajappa Rajkumar said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/industries-pin-their-hopes-on-rbi-bailout-package/article30612262.ece

474,2020/01/21,Rallying for road safety in central region,"The Tiruchi City Police flagged off a motorbike rally to kick off a series of events planned to observe the 31st Road Safety Week here on Monday.

Day one of the celebrations was marked by a bike rally led by women two-wheeler riders, who rode from Central Bus Stand to the Head Post Office with banners and placards.

The importance of riding two-wheelers with a helmet was driven home to the public through the awareness rally.

A students’ march and essay, elocution and painting contests on road safety topics would be organised for school students over the next few days.

The event was led by officials of the Regional Transport Office, traffic policemen and members of the District Road Safety Council.

In Ariyalur, Collector D. Rathna kicked off a two-wheeler rally from the municipal corporation office to the bus stand along with police personnel and other patrons.

Speaking at the event, she said the theme of Sadak Suraksha–Jeevan Raksha (road safety-protection of life) could only be fulfilled if all riders wore helmets.

“All two-wheelers must ride on the left side of the road, drivers who are hired by travel agencies and taxi services must ensure that they are well trained. We must aim to be an accident-free district,” she said.

Later in the day, Ms. Rathna visited the bus stand and handed out pamphlets on the importance of road safety to travellers.

In Pudukottai, Road Safety Week was observed with a bike rally organised by the Transport Department.

District Revenue Officer P. V. Saravanan flagged off the rally from the municipal corporation office where nearly 150 women from government colleges, self-help groups and NGOs took part to raise awareness on the importance of road safety.

475,2020/01/21,Two Bills tabled in Assembly to pave way for three capitals,"The State government introduced two Bills -- The Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of all Region Bill 2020 and The Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Bill 2020, in the Assembly on Monday. These Bills will give shape to the government’s plan of having three capitals for the State, with the Executive capital in Visakhapatnam, Legislative capital in Amaravati and Judicial capital in Kurnool. The CRDA Repeal Act will pave way for Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA).

The Andra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill 2020 also provides for dividing the State into various zones and establishing zonal planning and development boards. The village and (municipal) ward secretariats system that the government brought in October last year now gets statutory backing as it has been made part of the new Bill.

Tabling the Decentralisation and Inclusive Development Bill, Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy said that Legislative capital would be in Amaravati. Raj Bhavan, Secretariat and offices of the Heads of the Departments would be located at Executive capital of Visakhapatnam.

Similarly, the seat of all judicial institutions established under the State legislation, shall, as far as practicable, be located in Judicial capital of Kurnool. The government also proposed to establish Zonal Planning and Development Boards. Two to three districts would be brought under each Board, he said.

“Regional imbalances, absence of equitable growth have caused an acute sense of deprivation among various sections of the state population, leading to disturbances. The logical solution will be to lay emphasis on distributed development and decentralised administration to ensure fruits of socio-economic progress are enjoyed equally by people of various regions,” the Minister said, quoting the recommendations of the High-Power Committee (HPC) of Ministers and bureaucrats, which formed the basis of the new legislation.

TDP raises objection

The TDP legislators raised objection to the introduction of the Bill and stormed the Speaker’s podium. Amid the din, the government also moved the Bill to repeal the AP Capital Region Development Authority Act, 2014.

Tabling the Bill, Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana said that the government, following recommendations of the HPC for decentralised governance and distributed development, decided to repeal the CRDA Act 2014 with substantive savings clauses to protect the interests of the farmers. The landless poor would be paid annuity for an additional five years beyond the tenure fixed in the scheme at the fixed amount per annum equivalent to the annuity of the 10th year. All the assets and liabilities, both current and contingent, and bonds issued by the CRDA with the government guarantee would be transferred to AMRDA, he said.

The CRDA Act was enacted on 22 December 2014 for the development of the State capital post-bifurcation with a specific area demarcated as the capital region. Now that the YSR Congress government has decided to have three capitals for the State, the CRDA Act is proposed to be repealed.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/68mwu7/article30612537.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21ONGASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/two-bills-tabled-in-assembly-to-pave-way-for-three-capitals/article30612538.ece

The accused has been identified as Kurri Naga Venkata Satyanarayana, a resident of Kancharapalem, who is working as a driver of the houseowner, Peri Gopalakrishna.

“The accused has been working as a driver in the house of Mr. Gopalakrishna for last three months. Believing in Satyanarayana, the elderly couple gave him access to their house,” DCP (Zone-II) Uday Bhaskar told the media here.

The accused noticed that the couple had kept money and gold in the house. In the first week of January, Satyanarayana allegedly collected the key of the iron safe and made good with the valuables while the couple were asleep. After the incident, he never reported to his duty, fearing that he might be caught, said the DCP.

According to ACP (crime) Ch. Pentarao, the accused, before committing the crime, had burnt the CCTV wire in the apartment where the couple were living.

However, the CCTV footage provided the clue to the police.

‘Ring provided the clue’

The special team comprising ADCP (crime) V. Suresh Babu and west sub-division (crimes) inspector B. Srinivasa Rao and SI A. Manmadha Rao arrested the accused from S. Kota on Monday.

483,2020/01/21,Delhi Assembly elections: Kejriwal files papers after six hours in queue,"AAP national convenor and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal filed his nomination papers from the New Delhi Assembly constituency on January 21 evening, the last day for filing the poll papers, a party leader said.

Mr. Kejriwal had to wait at the Jamnagar House for over six hours before filing the nomination.

Holding token number 45, Mr. Kejriwal was seen waiting to file his nomination for the New Delhi Assembly seat on.

“Waiting to file my nomination. My token no is 45. There are many people here to file nomination papers. Am so glad so many people participating in democracy,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

Party leaders claimed that 35 candidates with incomplete papers were insisting that they will not allow the Chief Minister to file unless their nominations are filed and saw a “conspiracy”.

According to procedures, while nominations can be filed till 3 p.m., candidates who have collected tokens to file their papers before the stipulated time are allowed to do so whenever their numbers arrive.

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said no matter how much the BJP conspires they will not be able to stop Mr. Kejriwal from filing his nomination.

“BJP, no matter how much you conspire, you will not be able to stop Kejriwal from filing his nomination or from becoming the chief minister for the third time.

“Your conspiracies will not yield any result,” he said, tagging AAP MLA Saurabh Bharadwaj’s tweet who alleged that around 35 candidates were sitting at the office along with the chief minister without proper nomination papers or even 10 proposers.

“They (candidates) are insisting unless their papers are complete and they file their nominations, they won’t allow Chief Minister to file nomination,” he said.

Responding to Mr. Bhardwaj’s tweet, Mr. Kejriwal said it does not matter as many of them are filing their nominations for the first time.

“Doesn’t matter. Many of them are filing for the first time. They are bound to make mistakes. We also made mistakes the first time. We should hand hold them. I am enjoying waiting with them. They are all part of my family,” Mr. Kejriwal said in a tweet.

484,2020/01/21,JD(U)’s Pawan Varma questions tie-up with BJP in Delhi polls,"Ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections, for which Bihar’s ruling Janata Dal (United) has struck an alliance with the BJP to contest in two (Burari and Sangam Vihar) out of 70 seats, JD(U) leader and national spokesperson Pawan Varma on Tuesday wrote a letter to party president and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, asking for his “ideological clarity” on the pact with the BJP beyond Bihar, “especially at a time when the BJP, through the CAA-NPR-NRC combine, has embarked on a massive socially divisive agenda” aimed at mutilating the peace, harmony and stability of the country”.

“This is the first time that we will be broadening and extending our party’s association with the BJP through a formal electoral alliance, beyond Bihar… I am deeply perplexed by this development and look to you for ideological clarity”, Mr. Varma, who is also the national general secretary of the JD(U), wrote in his two-page letter.

Earlier, the JD(U) had announced it would contest all 70 seats in the Delhi polls.

Nitish’s ‘confession’

Mr. Varma reminded Mr. Kumar of his confession to him on more than one occasion about his “grave apprehensions” on the BJP-RSS combine. “In my first meeting with you in Patna in August 2012, you had spoken to me at length and with conviction on why Narendra Modi and his policies are inimical for the country”, wrote Mr. Varma. “When you were leading the ‘Mahagathbandhan’, you had openly made a call for RSS Mukt Bharat…these views articulated for a sustained period are a matter of public record”.

Mr. Varma earlier too had written a letter to Mr. Kumar, urging him not to support the CAA, the NRC and the NPR.

Party sources told The Hindu that both Mr. Varma and another leader, Prashant Kishor, had fallen out of Mr. Kumar’s proximity and were leaving no opportunity to put him (Mr. Kumar) and his party in an embarrassing situation on some issue or the other.

Both are not in the list of 20-star campaigners of the JD(U) for the Delhi elections.

Mr. Varma further said in his letter:

“I remember your confession to me in private how the current leadership in BJP party has humiliated you. You maintained on more than one occasion, that the BJP is leading India into a ‘dangerous space’. The BJP is destroying institutions and that there is a need for democratic and socialist forces within the country to regroup, a task for which you actually assigned a senior party official.

“If these are your real views, I fail to understand how the JD(U) is now extending its alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar when even long-standing allies of the BJP like the Akali Dal have refused to do so.

“In view of the above, I think there is an urgent need for the JD(U) to harmonize what the party’s constitution says, what the leader of the party feels in private, and what action the party takes in public…politics, as you have emphasised to us, must be about principle and the courage of conviction. I look forward to receiving some ideological clarity from you, either in a formal meeting of the JD(U) or through such means as you consider best”.

Refutes speculations

Mr. Varma reached Patna on Tuesday to participate in a function and refuted the speculations that he was going to join the Congress. When asked if he would Mr. Kumar, he said: “Why not? He is my party boss and if he would like to meet me and invite, I’ll certainly meet him”.

State JD(U) president Basistha Narayan Singh said he doesn’t want to make any comment on Mr. Varma’s letter. “What’s wrong if our party, which is in alliance with the BJP in Bihar, has struck an electoral alliance with them in Delhi?”, he said.

Senior State Congress leader and party MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said, “I must congratulate Mr. Varma for his audacity to show a mirror to Nitish Kumar who has been making turnarounds on several occasions for his political survival”.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lygjz8/article30561374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-NITISHKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/jdu-leader-pawan-varma-seeks-ideological-clarity-from-nitish-kumar-on-alliance-with-bjp/article30614014.ece

487,2020/01/21,Stories of hope and positivity,"Book launches are hardly ever held these days, and those that are usually attended by family and friends. However, the launch of Savi Sharma’s The Stories We Never Tell (Westland), which was held at Sapna Book House, Koramangala, was an exception. There was quite a big turn out of young readers, mostly college students who were eagerly waiting to interact with Savi.

She fielded questions from the audience about relationships and the value of friendship. The Stories We Never Tell is a contemporary story that not only revolves around mental health issues, but also the pressures that young people put on themselves. The Surat-based author’s other books include Everybody Has A Story-1, Everybody Has A Story-2, and This is Not Your Story.

How did the idea for The Stories We Never Tell come to you?

The idea came to me before I wrote Everyone has a Story-2. Many people messaged to tell me that they were suffering from depression. They were at a loss on how to deal with it. This was an issue that had to be put out these, people needed to understand that depression is an illness that needs treatment. I started researching mental health and depression but could not zero in on the characters. I put it aside to work on Everyone has a Story-2. I returned to this and created Jhanvi and Ashray from social media.

Tell us a little about the characters Jhanvi and Ashray

The story revolves around Jhanvi, a budding social media influencer, and Ashray, who despite a rocky life translates his dreams into reality. Jhanvi appears to have it all together, but something is missing. On the other hand, Ashray’s deep-seated insecurities emerge when life throws him a curve ball. Their stories are different. Jhanvi is fighting the outside world, while Ashray’s fight is internal. My favourite line in the book is when Jhanvi says: ‘I need help.’ Most people don’t know they need help.

Are young people your target readers?

I want to write specifically for young people because I think youngsters these days aren’t reading. If they start reading, they will get all the answers. They need to read stories they can connect with and the stories should be simple.

At the launch you said you were quite clear that you wanted to become a writer...how did you chart your course to being one?

I always loved writing. But it wasn’t until college that I was clear that I would take up writing full time. During the first year of college, I started reading books...I was pursuing my Chartered Accountancy (CA) then, and at the same time I was writing a story and that is when I realised I have to write a book, I am meant to do this.

I knew while writing my first book that it can be either successful or not. I thought whether a book is good or not is something others decide, not me. I started working on my second book (This Is Not Your Story) because I thought if the first book doesn’t work out, then I have this book.

What is the writing process like for you?

Once I decide my characters, I write a plot of two or three pages. I always know the end of my story.

Which among your books do you consider your best?

My first book is the closest to my heart, but my best book will always be my last. The Stories The Never Tell was the most challenging because the characters are complex. In the first few books my characters were simple. They were a bit sorted in their lives and they knew what to do. But in this book the characters are complex and dark. It was challenging to write a story in which the characters are in darkness and they are writing about hope.

What do you think about being called a celebrity author?

Tags don’t really matter to me; they are given by others, you cannot call yourself a celebrity. What people are making me is their department. I just know I want to write stories, inspire people and do whatever I can to spread positivity and motivate others.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/umxurp/article30615530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21bgmsavi2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/stories-of-hope-and-positivity/article30615533.ece
488,2020/01/21,"Nature, in pocket size: Let the Big Little Nature Books series be your guide to the natural world","When I first moved to Anaikatti, a village near Coimbatore, I was constantly asking questions about the plants, insects, and animals found in the area. And getting vague answers. What wouldn’t I have given for a series like the Big Little Nature Books (Dorling Kindersley)?

Series editor Nikhil Devasar | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Series editor Nikhil Devasar says something similar when asked about the idea behind these books. “While trying to identify basic flowers and insects, I noticed that there was no book in India, which would help me. It’s a subject every kid is interested in and there were no guides to help.”

The box set has five books (which can also be bought individually) with each featuring 100 animals, birds, bugs and butterflies, trees or garden flowers. Each book has been put together by subject experts with Nikhil overseeing the entire series. Since the books were about Nature, “we decided to include it all,” smiles Nikhil. Someone who’s got the box has a set of ready reckoners, he adds, “whether he’s in office or having tea in the garden. It helps anyone interested in Nature.”

I then proceed to exhibit my ignorance of the natural world by asking why spiders don’t feature in 100 Indian Bugs and Butterflies. And get a quick lesson on Arachnids. “Spiders are Arachnids, which are creatures with two body segments, eight legs, no wings or antennae and are not able to chew,” he explains. “Insects have six legs and three main body parts. Many people think that spiders are insects but they are mistaken.”

Once you tear yourself away from the attractive covers, the inside pages are equally riveting. In all the books, you get an introduction “How this book works” that explains the layout and information given. Apart from the scientific and common names, this includes a general description of the subject, its habitat, where it is seen and when, key identification marks, and IUCN status in the case of animals and birds. Little roundels carry interesting titbits like these: “The age of a Blue Whale can be determined by studying its ear wax, as a new layer of wax forms every six months.” Or “The pygmy hog is the only pig that builds a nest of grass to shelter its young.” Not to forget the marvellous photographs. While 100 Indian Birds has a note on bird watching and photography; 100 Indian Bugs and Butterflies talks about the role of insects in ecology. Another plus is the size. The individual books are not the humungous tomes one expects and can be easily slipped into a pocket while the box set doesn’t take much room in a backpack.

The only complaint is that the font chosen for the text is very thin and light. Even in the coloured roundels, it doesn’t show up too clearly. So one does have to focus a bit. That will hopefully be fixed in the next edition, which Nikhil says is a much bigger one and already under way.

489,2020/01/21,"Madras Bird Race is back, and over 100 bird species await","The rules of birdwatching are simple. “Wear dull colours, because birds are sensitive to reds, yellows and oranges. Be quiet. Wear clothes that cover you completely, because you will be exposed to all kinds of environments,” says 17-year-old Mahathi Narayanaswamy.

She should know. She has been doing this for the past four years, wading through the city’s marshlands, waiting by its lakes, making her way through shrubs and deciduous forests for the Madras Bird Race. Last year, she was rewarded by a rare sighting of the Pallas’s grasshopper-warbler at the Perumbakkam Tank. She is not the only one who finds the exercise worth it.

Know the basics Time: Dawn to dusk

Equipment: Binoculars, notepad, pencil

Target: To record as many species of birds as possible

Participants: Experienced amateurs and budding birdwatchers, in teams of four

In the past few years, the race has been seeing a steady participation of about 150 birding enthusiasts. “At least 80 of them each time are first-time birders,” says KV Sudhakar, secretary, Madras Naturalists’ Society. Constant interest by newcomers is something the society takes pride in; in fact, the organisation has experts available on request, in case the fresher pairs of eyes need some guidance or advice.

That is not the only help provided — “Once you register, your team will receive a booklet listing out nearly 160 species of birds you are likely to see in and around Chennai,” says Sudhakar. These log books, feature space for a number of observations per sighting — whether the bird you saw is male or female; was it nesting or feeding or mating. “You don’t have to fill all of it in, but serious birders like to,” says Sudhakar.

So just how serious is this exercise? In Mahathi’s first year, her team alone spotted about 136 species of birds. Last year, the winning team managed to spot 131 species: a veritable doff of the hat to this city’s biodiversity.

According to the society’s bulletin, in the 2019 race, “Five rare species were sighted — Bar-headed Goose at the Great Salt Lake [on the road from Thiruporur to Nemmeli], Tree Pipit at Thaiyur Lake [three kilometres off Old Mahabalipuram Road, on the road to Kayar], Pallas’s Grasshopper Warbler at Perumbakkam Tank, Slender-billed Gull at Adyar Estuary and the Brown Hawk Owl at IIT-Madras.”

The more, the merrier The Great Backyard Bird Count entered its 22nd edition in February last year. Part of the global count by the same name, it is held for four days every February and at least 13 Indian cities participate.

Campus Bird Count is a subset of the same event, albeit restricted to campuses, and to those who live, study or work in them.

Pongal Bird Count is held across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry during the festival, and is coordinated by Tamil Birders Network and Bird Count India. It is being held since 2015.

Bihu Bird Count was organised in Assam for the first time this year, by Bird Count India.

Chennai and its surroundings are home to about 30 birding hotspots. While some of them, unsurprisingly, exist around water bodies — like Adyar Estuary and Puzhal Lake, all the way up to Pulicat — others are in less public locations. For instance, institutes like Madras Christian College and Indian Institute of Technology both have green, bird-friendly campuses that feature in MNS’ list of hotspots.

It is not just about the sightings either. At the end of the race, all participants gather to give in their log books, discuss their sightings, swap stories from the day. As Sudhakar puts it, all of it is just one large exercise in creating an active bird-loving community. “The conservation of our environment is not something that can be left to the Government or the Forest Departments. It needs to happen at the grass-roots, with the help of citizens.”

The race will be held on January 26. Registrations close at midnight of January 22.

490,2020/01/21,Government yet to seek green clearance for water aerodromes,"A year after 10 water aerodromes were awarded to airlines for seaplane operations, the government is yet to seek environmental clearance for them.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation appointed a consultant, M/s Feedback Infra, to prepare a detailed project report in August last year. Subsequently, a proposal was sent to the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) seeking the “terms of reference” for conducting an environment impact assessment (EIA) for three waterdromes in Andaman and Nicobar, which was granted on November 25. Once the EIA is finalised, the apex body under the MoEF, Environment Approval Committee, will take it up for clearance.

This process is yet to be undertaken for the remaining seven waterdromes.

“We are submitting the request [to the Environment Ministry] phase wise. The process of seeking environmental clearance requires a lot of data such as bathymetric test,” a Ministry spokesperson said.

In January 2019, the government announced winners of the third round of UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik) — the government’s low-cost flying scheme. Among the routes awarded to airlines were those that provided air connectivity to 10 waterdromes — the Statue of Unity, the Sabarmati riverfront and the Shatrunjay dam in Gujarat; the Nagarjuna Sagar dam and the Prakasam barrage in Andhra Pradesh and Havelock Island, Neill Island and Long island in Andaman and Nicobar. Eight of these waterdromes in Gujarat, Assam and Andaman and Nicobar were awarded to the SpiceJet and the remaining two were bagged by the Turbojet Aviation Private Limited.

Asked when the sea plane operations are likely to take off, the official said, “We are preparing a roadmap along with SpiceJet, which is one of the selected airlines for the operations. We expect some waterdromes to start operations in the next four-six months.”

As per the EAC’s “terms of reference” for the waterdromes in Andaman and Nicobar, the Ministry of Civil Aviation will have to provide information about toilet waste from flights, disposal of trash collected during flights and waste from eateries and shops at the aerodromes. Details have also been sought about the impact of noise on the sensitive environment and presence of corals.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjwm8x/article30609286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THLTSEAPLANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/government-yet-to-seek-green-clearance-for-waterdromes/article30609287.ece
491,2020/01/21,"Not enough is known about China coronavirus strain, says WHO official Roderico Ofrin","As six deaths were reported in China due to the Novel Coronavirus [2019-nCoV], Dr. Roderico Ofrin, Regional Emergency Director, World Health Organisation (WHO) South-East Asia Region, has said much remains to be understood about the virus.

In an interview to The Hindu, he said an emergency meeting of the WHO will assess the situation. It will decide whether the situation constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and what recommendations should be made, explained Dr. Ofrin.

222 official reports

According to WHO Worldwide, there have been a total of 222 officially reported, confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV — 218 in China, two in Thailand, one in Japan and one in the Republic of Korea — as on January 20.

Stating that not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how the virus is transmitted, the clinical features of the disease, its severity, the extent to which it has spread, or its source, Dr. Ofrin said, “Based on previous experiences with respiratory illnesses and in particular with other Coronavirus outbreaks and our analysis of data shared by China, human to human transmission is likely occurring.”

“More cases could be expected in other parts of China and possibly other countries in the coming days,” he noted.

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illnesses ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. A Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.

“An animal source seems the most likely primary source of this outbreak, with limited human to human transmission occurring between close contacts. WHO’s guidance to countries includes the possibility of the disease spreading through contact with animals, contaminated food, and/or person to person,” said Dr. Ofrin.

Full text of the interview:

What are coronaviruses?

Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. Some transmit easily from person to person, while others do not.

What is the known extent of spread as of now? What is the extent of danger that we face in terms of it spreading?

Worldwide, there has been a total of 222 officially reported, confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV — 218 in China, two in Thailand, one in Japan and one in the Republic of Korea [as of January 20]. More cases could be expected in other parts of China, and possibly other countries, in the coming days.

Much remains to be understood about this novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Not enough is known to draw definitive conclusions about how it is transmitted, clinical features of the disease, its severity, the extent to which it has spread or its source.

The WHO Director-General is convening an Emergency Committee on the new coronavirus under International Health Regulations. The Committee will meet on January 22 to advise him if the situation constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, and what recommendations should be put in place.

Reports suggest that 2019-nCoV infection can cause mild to severe disease, and be fatal in some. Based on current data, some new cases seem to experience milder disease, which is within the milder end of spectrum of symptoms caused by respiratory illnesses.

What is the mode of its transmission?

Based on current information, an animal source seems the most likely primary source of this outbreak, with limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts. As the source of the outbreak remains unclear, WHO’s guidance to countries and individuals includes the possibility of the disease spreading through of contact with animals, contaminated food, and/or person-to-person.

Based on previous experience with respiratory illnesses and in particular with other coronavirus outbreaks and our analysis of the data shared by China, human-to-human transmission is likely occurring.

On January 20, Chinese authorities confirmed that, in the light of the latest developments, there is human-to-human transmission among close contacts, though the extent of such transmission is not able to be determined with available information.

Although an animal source seems the most likely primary source of this outbreak, investigations are still required to determine the exact source and mode of transmission of the virus.

Is there any ongoing research on this and if so, who is doing it?

WHO is proposing specific studies to better understand transmission, risk factors, and source of the infection. Some of these studies are being undertaken already.

A team from WHO is concluding a mission with health officials in Wuhan working on the response to 2019-nCoV. While in Wuhan, the team has been meeting with health experts and officials conducting the investigation into the outbreak, the mission is part of ongoing information-sharing between the Government of China and WHO.

WHO has been in regular and direct contact with Chinese as well as Japanese, Korean and Thai authorities since the reporting of these cases. The three countries have shared information with WHO under the International Health Regulation (IHR).

WHO is constantly analysing data as we receive it, and working closely with global networks of experts on a range of topics. As more cases are identified and more analysis undertaken, we will get a clearer picture of disease severity and transmission patterns. We will update and expand our guidance as we learn more.

WHO is working with our networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, modelling, diagnostics, clinical care and treatment, and other ways to identify, manage the disease and limit onward transmission.

What is the WHO safety network offered when a virus outbreak of this scale occurs?

WHO has been working on strengthening health security through the implementation of the International Health Regulations (2005) adopted by 194 countries. The IHR are an international legal instrument that aim to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. IHR require countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO. Building on WHO’s experience in global disease surveillance, alert and response, the IHR define the rights and obligations of countries to report public health events, and establish a number of procedures that WHO must follow in its work to uphold global public health security.

WHO has been working with countries to build core capacities to respond to public health emergencies. And when events such as the current one occur, WHO, based on evidence, shares guidelines with member countries to prevent and minimize impact of these events.

On this novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), WHO has issued interim guidance on testing as well as infection prevention and control practices for suspected cases, and continues to update this information in consultation with networks of experts across the globe. WHO is working closely with countries to help them prepare for the rapid detection and response to cases or clusters.

Even before an outbreak strikes, WHO is constantly on alert for the emergence of known and new severe respiratory diseases and offers technical advice and capacity strengthening as needed, including laboratory support. We are mandated to keep other countries informed of any threats and to provide guidance on how to respond. On January 2 the incident management system was activated across the three levels of WHO (country office, regional office and headquarters) and the Organization is prepared to mount a broader response, if needed.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/olsusa/article30617317.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAOUTBREAK1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/not-enough-is-known-about-china-coronavirus-strain-says-who-official-roderico-ofrin/article30617318.ece
492,2020/01/21,"Despite epilepsy, this Delhi man pursues endurance cycling","Vinay Jani’s WhatsApp status reads, “The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a man’s determination.” Jani, who was at 135 kg at 18, lost 60 kg through diet and exercise, over seven moths. He became a regular gym goer, but at 21, had an unexpected seizure.

His doctors discovered a cyst in his brain that was non-cancerous and didn’t need an operation, but they put him on medication and said he should halt exercise and driving. “That really put me into depression,” says Jani, now 35, who, over the next three years went back to 110 kg. His turning point came when his neurologist told him that medication was given in accordance with weight. “He said you have a choice: I can increase your medication or you can lose the weight.” Jani decided on the latter.

So he went back to the gym and worked out for the next few years, sometimes asking for help for weights that were too heavy, making sure not to stress his body out too much. At 31, he had another seizure, but this time he didn’t stop exercise. He continued regular work too, as a distribution partner for Lotus Herbals.

Towards the end of 2015, his gym spin coach, Gautam Verma, who started SpinLife, a cycling group in Gurugram, asked him to come and ride. “I said I didn’t have a bike, and he immediately replied, ‘Borrow one from me,’” says Jani. He has ridden with the group ever since, going on to do a series of long-distance endurance cycling rides, called the Brevets de Randonneurs Mondiaux (BRM), culminating in an ultra (1,000 km within 75 hours, the cut-off time) in 2018.

“Someone always rides with me, and they have my SOS medication,” says Jani. Last year, even at one of the toughest cycling events, the Paris-Brest-Paris, a 1,200 km course, he had his buddies along. Jani is lucky that his family supports him in his pursuit of endurance cycling, but he also says he doesn’t miss a single dose of medication or his doctor’s appointment.

493,2020/01/21,Anvayaa’s 360-degree programme lends a helping hand to the elderly,"Ignoring the silent cries of elders when they are helpless, could possibly be the worst form of emotional abuse. The lack of your physical presence could further compound their helplessness, and yours. If you are an NRI with elderly parents living in India, how do you tend to their needs?

Prashanth Reddy, a US-based businessman, and an only child of parents living in Hyderabad, faced this struggle. It led him to map out a sustainable business proposition: creating a model that combines technology and personalised home services. Which is how he founded Anvayaa (or family in Sanskrit) in Hyderabad, which has been handling parental care services since 2016. It has extended its services to Bengaluru and Chennai, and hopes to expand operations in Mumbai, Pune and Delhi by the end of this year.

“When you say ‘elder care’, the first thing that pops up is health. Having spoken to over 400 families, what we noticed is that only 30% had issues related to health. The rest were cases of loneliness and lack of emotional care,” says Prashanth, whose company recently bagged the first place among 150 companies which participated at E-Cell Summit 2020, a summit fostering innovative startup companies, organised by IIT Madras.

Emotional support

Geriatric care is a fast growing market sector in the country. Where Anvayaa differs, from many other outfits in this category, is its functionality. Prashanth says this a 360-degree programme, which enables a host of services, including healthcare, daily care and payment care to name a few.

When a client subscribes to Anvayaa, he/she is assigned a care manager, a full-time employee who acts as the immediate reference point for that particular family. The next step involves collection of data. Medical records, family history, medicine reminders and so on are fed into the server, and onto a mobile application, which is then made accessible to both parents and children.

“We have not been insisting on using mobile phones because most of them are seniors who prefer to call the Supportive Care, which is available 24x7,” Prashanth says, adding that the company has an age bracket, enrolling seniors who are 60 plus (for single mothers, it is 50 plus).

An emergency plan is created for each family, and the volunteer from Anvayaa does basic assessment using records gathered from clients. “We need to be aware of every little detail in case of emergency, such as whether they have a family doctor, and contact details of close relatives. All the data is collected and stored to avoid chaos,” he says, adding, “The person living abroad gets real-time updates of every action performed during the course of an emergency.”

He adds that it is important to keep the children in the loop. “Especially when it comes to matters concerning their consent. It is quite simple; you pay, take the service and know there is someone to question,” says Prashanth, adding that Anvayaa has been supporting over 20 families in Chennai, since it launched about nine months ago.

At your fingertips

Name the service you want — home maintenance, transportation, cook services, laundry, health insurance and passport application — Anvayaa’s 60-member team will get it done, Prashanth asserts. “In most households, issues are more psychological than physical. What we noticed is that elderly people need someone to accompany them, even for something as simple as grocery shopping,” he says.

They also provide an option where clients can arrange for surprise events, say birthdays or wedding anniversaries. All they need to do is to create a reminder on the application. “A client wanted to celebrate his parents’ wedding anniversary. So we invited their relatives to the house without the parents’ knowledge and surprised them,” he says. Escorted outings, as it is called, can be worked out via payment care — a prepaid account where you can drop in money for your parents.

Monitoring vitals The USP of Anvayaa is to integrate technology and personal care without being invasive. They are currently working on a wearable device, designed using IOT technology, to track vitals — blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen level. “It is still in the testing phase. It has a provision to make an SOS call, in case of emergency. They just have to press a button and we’ll be there.”

While Anvayaa was initially founded to assist NRIs, the company is being used increasingly by children located across the country, to look after parents in their home towns. So far, Prashanth says they are supporting over 1,000 families.

What keeps them motivated, more than the money, is the blessings that come their way, says Prashanth, adding with a smile. “I took my mom to an Anvayaa event, where she spoke to one of the family members, who is also a mother. She said, ‘I am glad that my son, who lives in the US, has found a son for me in India’.”

Anvayaa is currently operational in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai. Packages differ in each city and range anywhere between ₹50,000 and ₹1.6 lakh/year.
