0,2020/01/15,"From the Archives (January 15, 1920): Indian Science Congress.","Nagpur, January, 13. - Sir Benjamin Robertson opened the session of the Indian Science Congress yesterday evening. The Central Province, he said, was considered backward but it had immense potentialities with richest manganese mines and up-to-date textile mills and with rapid strides taken in scientific agriculture he was confident that the province will take high rank in scientific achievement. Being under orders to leave for South Africa he was sorry he was not able to extend his hospitality at Government House to the Congress. He was leaving, he said, for Bombay on Thursday to meet his successor Sir Frank Sly who was immediately proceeding to Delhi to attend the Conference there of Provincial Governments. In requesting Dr. Ray to deliver the inaugural address Sir Benjamin referred to his splendid research work in Bengal which brought him worldwide fame and which was sure to bear fruit in industrial development.

Dr. Ray next delivered his address.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/from-the-archives-january-15-1920-indian-science-congress/article30568954.ece
1,2020/01/15,The risk of a domino effect,"Following the killing of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani by the U.S., regional tensions have threatened the fragile political consensus that has kept two neighbouring states, Lebanon and Iraq, from disintegrating.

Two fragile states

Lebanon is home to Iran’s most important regional collaborator, Hezbollah. Although an autonomous political player, Hezbollah is beholden to Iran for financial and military support that has helped it solidify its base in Lebanon and confront Israel, a strong U.S. ally. It has acted as Iran’s foremost proxy in the Syrian civil war and has contributed substantially to the Assad regime’s victory over rebels. Hezbollah considers Israel its foremost enemy against whom it last fought a major war in 2006. Analysts assumed that Iran’s immediate reaction to Soleimani’s assassination would be to unleash Iranian-supplied Hezbollah rockets on northern Israel. Better sense appears to have prevailed in Tehran. Had a lethal conflict occurred between Hezbollah and Israel, Tel Aviv would have again destroyed much of Lebanese infrastructure and wreaked havoc on its population as it did in 2006. The Lebanese political structure, based on a delicate confessional balance and under stress from mass protests against the political elite, most likely would have collapsed leading to Lebanon joining the ranks of failed states.

Iraq’s problems are even greater. It has borne the brunt of the fallout of the latest round of U.S.-Iran confrontation, for which it has been the battleground. The U.S. strike that killed Soleimani took place in Iraqi territory. The attack not only violated Iraqi sovereignty, but also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) and the commander of Kata’ib Hezbollah, which played a leading role in the storming of the American embassy a few days earlier. PMF is a coalition of Shia militias that now acts as an arm of the Iraqi armed forces. In retaliation for Soleimani’s assassination, Iran targeted two U.S. military bases again in Iraq, further confirming its centrality in the U.S.-Iran confrontation.

Consequences for Iraq

Soleimani’s assassination and the events that followed it have had four major consequences for Iraq. First, they have heightened anti-American feelings in its populace, especially among the majority Shia, which has led to the Iraqi parliament passing a resolution demanding the expulsion of all foreign forces from Iraqi soil. Second, it has brought to an abrupt end the demonstrations calling for an end to Iranian intervention in Iraqi affairs; instead, a sympathy wave has turned the tide of popular opinion in favour of Iran. Third, the wave of anti-Americanism also clearly depicts the fissure within the Iraqi polity between the Kurds and the Shia Arab majority: the Kurdish representatives, in addition to most Sunni Arab members, boycotted the parliamentary session that passed the resolution calling for U.S. withdrawal as most Kurds consider American military presence essential to safeguard their autonomy in the north and to continue the fight against the Islamic State (IS). Finally, the projected removal of U.S. forces and Soleimani’s killing are likely to embolden IS cells in Iraq to increase their terrorist attacks in the country and emerge once again as a threat to the Iraqi state and its population.

Since 2003, Iraq has become the principal arena in which U.S.-Iran competition has played out in West Asia. The escalation of this rivalry is likely to add to its inherent fragility, once again opening up the possibility of its eventual descent into a failed state. Iraq is the centrepiece of the regional order that was constructed at the end of World War I. Its unravelling is bound to affect Syria and Lebanon, both suffering from state debilitation, and could lead to an unstoppable domino effect that may well change the map of West Asia as we know it today.

2,2020/01/15,A government that chooses its critics,"On November 16, 2019, the Central Bureau of Investigation raided Amnesty International’s offices in Bengaluru and Delhi based on allegations that the NGO had violated provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010, and of the Indian Penal Code. Amnesty has been vocal about human rights abuses, notably in Jammu and Kashmir and Assam.

The raid is not an isolated incident but part of a pattern of harassment of NGOs in India. In early 2019, Greenpeace had to shut two offices in India and reduce its staff. Since 2015, Greenpeace India has been barred from receiving foreign donations. In July 2019, there were raids in the offices of the Lawyers Collective. In 2019 alone, more than 1,800 NGOs lost their licence to receive foreign funding.

This is worrying given that international funding is crucial for NGOs to function. The contribution of NGOs to human rights and public awareness is significant in India. The recognition of the rights of homosexuals and transgender people, for instance, would have been unimaginable without the sustained effort of civil society organisations. Likewise, developments in the public provision of health and education are unlikely to come about without pressure by NGOs.

Most NGOs are neither politically powerful nor have great financial capacity. For example, small environmental or tribal rights groups protesting against environmental violations by multinational companies cannot fight back against companies that use their resources — profits from elsewhere — for public relations, campaigning, and advertisement to resist the protests. Thus there is a power imbalance in this struggle, exacerbated by financial restraints on organisations.

What is ‘public interest’?

The FCRA regulates the receipt of funding from sources outside of India to NGOs working in India. It prohibits receipt of foreign contribution “for any activities detrimental to the national interest”. The Act specifies that NGOs require the government’s permission to receive funding from abroad. The government can refuse permission if it believes that the donation to the NGO will adversely affect “public interest” or the “economic interest of the state”. This condition is manifestly overbroad. There is no clear guidance on what constitutes “public interest”. Consequently, a government could construe any disagreement with, or criticism of, any of its policies as being against public interest.

The current government has already done this. For example, in 2014, several groups including Greenpeace were accused by the Intelligence Bureau of stalling India’s economic development. In the government’s narrow view, public interest is interpreted as being equivalent to its priorities. That is simply not the case. Thus, an environmental or human rights organisation criticising the government can be accused of “acting against public interest”.

Consequences on rights

The restrictions also have serious consequences on both the rights to free speech and freedom of association under Articles 19(1)(a) and 19(1)(c) of the Constitution. The freedom is based on the idea that individuals can form voluntary groups and pursue various interests. It is a form of collective expression and thought. The Supreme Court has held that this right includes the right to continued sustenance of the association, without unreasonable restraint (Damyanti Naranga v. Union of India, 1971).

The foreign funding prohibition also negates the significance of voluntary, non-profit associations in a democracy. Free speech is valuable not because everyone agrees, but because it enables a culture of dissent, deliberation, and debate. The right to free speech is affected in two ways. One, by allowing only some political groups to receive foreign donations and disallowing some others, the government can ensure a biased political debate. It can reduce critical voices by declaring them to be against public interest. Two, this chilling effect on free speech can lead to self-censorship. Speech that is protected by the Constitution can be construed as “against public interest”. Thus, the standard regulates speech in a manner that is incompatible with the Constitution. In Shreya Singhal v. Union of India (2015), the Supreme Court was similarly faced with overbroad classifications in the Information Technology Act. Striking down Section 66A, the Court held that the Act could be used in a manner that has a chilling effect on free speech. This has already happened in the case of the FCRA. NGOs need to tread carefully when they criticise the regime, knowing that too much criticism could cost their survival.

Democracy requires critics and civil society. This is why invoking the FCRA to curb the work of NGOs is deeply troubling. In a democracy, criticism should be welcomed, not repressed. No government should ever be able to choose its own critics.

3,2020/01/15,Running out of tricks,"There is a classic American street hustle called Three-card Monte. A simple description of it is ‘a sidewalk gambling game run by shady operators to fleece passersby’. The operator sits with a flat surface in front of him on which he moves three playing cards, their backs facing up. Two of the cards are of the same kind, and one different. At the start of the ‘game’, the man shows you the cards before turning them over, telling you to keep your eye on the odd card. Then he moves the cards around. When he stops, you have to point out the odd card. In order to draw you in, the man moves the cards at a slow speed. Then he moves them faster, but you find you can still manage to keep your eye on the odd card. As you watch, other people play and win easy money. Once you take the plunge, things change. The earlier players take their winnings and leave. As you put your money down, the hands become a blur. You’re still sure you’re tracking the right card, but somehow you never win. As you bet more and more money, the man varies his speed and histrionics, occasionally slowing down ‘to make it easy for you’, and you keep feeling you’re just about to win big but your wallet keeps emptying.

The perils of questioning

What is happening is that the man is actually holding two cards in one hand, holding on to the odd card and dropping the wrong one in its place. A more elaborate version of this has the operator show you the cards he has in his shirt pocket; here he uses more than three cards, one of them double-sided (example, joker one side, ace on the other) but deftly changes them over in his pocket. With either method, the result is the same: your greed, gullibility and distractability are used to cheat you.

In India and elsewhere, there are similar gambling games, using cards or walnuts and peas or whatever, all working the same principle. Now, should you accept your losses and go, the matter ends. However, if you spot the cheating mechanism and point that out, or if you grab the man’s hand and demand to see the cards, the friendly patter will cease. Thugs standing not too far away will suddenly loom over you, possibly the same men who were ‘winning’ when you first got there. You will be told to leave quietly or face serious bodily harm. If you call for the police, you will likely find them looking the other way or threatening to arrest you after you’ve been beaten up, for they too are in the team.

Gambling with a country

You can write off your losses and walk away from a con man on the street, but how do you walk away from your own country? Over the last five years and seven months Indians have been subjected to an elaborate version of Three-card Monte. For those who have had a different view of the card game, the sleights of hand come as no surprise, but for many millions the moment of questioning, of doubting the fairness of the ‘game’, of spotting the double-faced cards has only happened recently. As the questioning and challenging have spread, the goon auxiliary has descended, openly working with the complicit police — attacking the people asking questions, the many who have been calling out the fraud from long before, as well as innocent passersby.

As many have suspected for a while, the recent, widespread use of naked criminal force by both uniformed personnel and non-uniformed thugs confirms that this is not a regime which ever sees itself relinquishing power. Whether its Constitution-changing exercises of brutality in Kashmir or Kanpur, Messrs. Modi, Shah and Ajay Mohan Bisht (aka Yogi Adityanath) seem to have no worries about being called to account by the voting public. These men seem to think that the normal brakes of democracy that keep ruling parties and politicians in check have been disabled. However, their rigged card game has now been caught out, their distractions and obfuscations have run their course, and the whole sorry operation has now been challenged by the victims and potential victims alike. And thus, our grievously assaulted Republic is now at a moment of reckoning.

After watching the BJP-RSS government for over half a decade what becomes ever clearer is that this regime has never had anything in its bag that could be mistaken for governance or plans for genuine progress. The people who voted for them hoping for a centre-right, pro-business government perhaps with a garnish of Hindutva now see that that the garnish was the main dish and feel bitterly disappointed and utterly foolish. The less privileged sections of younger voters, the ones who were aspirationally impatient, now find their hopes of economic betterment dashed and pushed back indefinitely. Those who nurtured grandiose dreams of India muscling its way to becoming a superpower now find that the country is an international laughing stock after the Balakot airstrike, back in the regional ghetto, hyphen-yoked to Pakistan, and security-wise far more vulnerable than it was in early 2014. Those who imagined that the big election victory last May would allow Mr. Modi and Co. to prioritise desperately needed measures for the economy and healthcare now see that NDA 2.0 is like a delinquent child in a sweet shop, grabbing and smashing its way towards its favourite sweets, utterly uncaring of the nourishment needed by the nation.

Stopping a disease

When a badly applied coat of paint dries, the marks that have been covered up start to re-emerge from underneath. It is clear, yet again, that this government has never had any honest vision or master plan; the duo leading it have always depended on bluff and bluster to capture power and retain it. It is now clear that they have had an amazing streak of luck, coupled with their managing to leverage the plentiful weaknesses and hypocrisies of their opponents.

This regime has leeched on to all that is worst in our society, all that is most riven and wretched, and put itself in a position where it thinks of itself as unassailable, immovable. But this kind of a spread has a limit and sets off a resistance. And perhaps that is what is happening now.

4,2020/01/15,Chalk and cheese in private vs. government schools,"One of the big debates in early childhood education is on children’s “school readiness” and whether early childhood education provides them with the requisite skills to cope with the school curriculum. A vast literature exists on the importance of certain cognitive abilities that are supposed to be developed during the years children spend in pre-school, so that they are “ready” when they enter school in grade one.

Home and other factors

In terms of what children learn in school, one of the big debates is whether children in private schools perform better than those in government schools. In the Indian context, the consensus seems to be that a large proportion of the differences in the learning levels of children enrolled in private and government schools can be attributed to “home factors”. And, while the private school effect remains positive, even after taking into account the child’s home environment, learning outcomes in private schools are nowhere near grade competency. But, when do these differences start to manifest themselves? Do children who start grade one in private schools have a learning advantage? Let us look at the case of language. According to the grade 1 curriculum, children are supposed to be able to identify and read words and simple sentences. According to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2019, 21% children in grade one of government schools could read words compared to 46.7% in private schools — an advantage of 122%. How is this possible? Is this a fair comparison? Are we comparing apples with apples? The answer is clearly no.

First, the age distribution in grade one of government schools is very different from that in private schools. The Right to Education and national policy mandates that children enter grade one at age six. However, 26.1% children in grade one of government schools are four or five years old compared to 15.7% in private schools. At the other end of the spectrum, 30.4% children in grade one of government schools are seven-eight years old compared to 45.4% in private schools. Therefore, comparing learning levels in grade one between government and private schools becomes problematic. The higher learning levels in grade one, in private schools, may be partly due to the fact that grade one in those schools has a higher proportion of older children.

Second, it is well known that children who go to private schools come from relatively affluent backgrounds. They also tend to have more educated parents. This affords them certain advantages which are not available to children who are from less advantaged families and are more likely to attend government schools. For instance, 30% of government school grade one children, in the ASER 2019 sample, had mothers who had never been to school compared to only 12% of grade one private school children. Further, 27.3% of grade one children in private schools had private tutors compared to 19.5% in government schools.

Third, early childhood education is supposed to prepare children for school. Children are supposed to be exposed to activities that build their cognitive abilities and early literacy and numeracy skills. For instance, the National Early Childhood Care and Education curriculum framework talks about developing skills related to sequential thinking, predicting patterns, observing, reasoning and problem solving in the pre-school stage. These cognitive and early language skills are highly correlated with the child’s ability to acquire further language skills. Therefore, children who enter grade one better prepared with these skills are likely to perform better. For instance, among the cognitive tasks administered in ASER 2019 (seriation, pattern recognition and puzzle) only 23.8% children of grade one in government schools could do all three tasks compared to 43.1% in private schools.

Once we take into account all these factors — age distribution in grade one, home factors such as affluence, mother’s education, home learning environment, and some baseline abilities that children enter grade one with, private schools still have a learning advantage. Where is this coming from? Since we are talking about grade one, this difference cannot be attributed to an accumulated effect of better teaching practices in private schools.

Pre-school learning

What private pre-schools are doing is to start children on the school-based curriculum in pre-school itself. In other words, the private sector keeps children longer in pre-school and exposes them to school-like curricula even before they have entered school. For instance, 14% children in anganwadis could recognise letters or more compared to 52.9% in private pre-schools; and 12.9% children in these private pre-schools were already reading words (something they are supposed to learn in grade one) compared to 2.9% in anganwadis. It is not surprising, therefore, that children from private pre-schools perform better in school.

Finally, children in anganwadis do worse than private pre-school children on cognitive as well as early language tasks such as picture description. For instance, while 23.4% of private pre-school children could do all three cognitive tasks, only about half (12%) of the children in anganwadis could do them.

India has a huge investment in its early childhood programme, administered through 1.2 million anganwadis under the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme. The findings of ASER 2019 make a clear case for strengthening these early childhood education centres so that they implement appropriate “school-readiness” activities. A case can also be made for streamlining the curriculum at the pre-school stage so that all pre-schools focus on activities that build cognitive and early literacy and numeracy skills. These will aid further learning.

5,2020/01/15,Theological thicket: On SC's hearing in Sabarimala temple case,"The opening hearing before a nine-judge Supreme Court Bench, constituted to give an authoritative pronouncement on the nature of religious freedom under the Constitution, has revealed the conceptual confusion over the reference made to it. The Bench, headed by the Chief Justice of India, S.A. Bobde, has asked lawyers to “re-frame” the issues, or add to them, following submissions that the questions framed by a Bench of five judges were too broad. Further, the CJI has clarified that the Court will not be deciding the petitions seeking a review of the verdict in the Sabarimala temple case. Instead, it would limit itself to “larger questions” such as the interplay between freedom of religion and other fundamental rights; and the extent to which courts can probe whether a particular practice is essential to that religion or not. At the same time, he has said, “We will decide questions of law on women’s entry into mosques/temples, genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohras, entry of Parsi women who marry outside the community into the fire temple. We will not decide the individual facts of each case.” It would be prudent if this approach means that the Bench would set out the limits of the freedom of religion, against which such practices can be tested and their legality determined. However, it would be unwise if the examination of every discriminatory practice becomes a fresh treatise on Articles 25 and 26, instead of being subjected to a simple test whether the particular practice is protected by the freedom of religion, or can be curbed on the grounds of “public order, morality and health”.

A signal flaw in the reference is that it did not emanate from Benches before which these matters were pending. Normally, such issues are referred to a larger Bench only if the Court is faced with apparently contradictory precedents, or feels that the settled law requires reconsideration. A five-judge Bench, while hearing the Sabarimala review petitions, had referred a set of questions to a larger Bench. But two dissenting judges had pointed out that it was up to Benches before which such cases came up to decide whether they should go by existing precedent, or refer the matter to larger Benches for fresh consideration. That the strength of the Bench was fixed at nine may indicate that the court is leaving scope for revisiting the 1954 seven-judge Bench decision in the Shirur Mutt case, holding that religious denominations had the autonomy to decide what religious practices were essential to them. A reconsideration of this “essentiality doctrine” will be useful only if it is a means to rid the court of the burden of entering the theological thicket. However, even without revisiting the judgment, courts have often given verdicts that protect individual rights, and uphold equality and dignity over regressive religious practices.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/theological-thicket-on-scs-hearing-in-sabarimala-temple-case/article30569584.ece
6,2020/01/15,Inflation shocker: On rise of consumer price inflation,"The inflation devil is back and at the wrong time. The 7.35% rise in consumer price inflation in December is a shocker even to those who were prepared for an elevated level of inflation in the backdrop of the rise in prices of food commodities in general, and the astronomical rise in the price of onions, in particular. The disturbing December print has set off fears over whether India is entering a period of slow growth accompanied by high inflation, in other words, stagflation. Such fears have to be weighed against a few facts. First, the headline inflation number is driven mainly by food inflation at 14.12% — it was 10.01% in November and -2.65% in December 2018. While onion was the prime villain pushing up price inflation in vegetables to a huge 60.50% compared to December 2018, prices of other food items such as meat and fish (up 9.57%), milk (up 4.22%), eggs (up 8.79%) and some pulses were also on the upswing. These are a largely seasonal rise in prices and are driven mainly by supply-side factors and the prices will reverse once the supply shortfall is addressed. An analysis by State Bank of India’s research team shows that minus the increase in prices of onion, potato and ginger, headline CPI inflation would be just 4.48%. Second, core inflation, which is the one that should be of concern, has only inched up marginally from 3.5% in November to 3.7% in December. That said, it would be worrisome indeed if core inflation were to shoot up or if food inflation does not cool down in the next couple of months. Also, the effects of the increase in telecom tariffs, rail tickets and in fuel prices need to be closely watched.

The sharp jump in the CPI has queered the pitch for the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy review in February. The central bank stood pat on rates in the December policy precisely due to fears of inflation and had even revised upwards its inflation projection for the second half of the fiscal to 4.7-5.1%. The December print is way above the monetary policy committee’s (MPC) mandated limit of 6% (4% plus 2%) which means that a rate cut is pretty much off the table for now. Yet, with growth sagging, there is pressure on the central bank to cut rates at least one more time to stimulate growth. It would be interesting to watch the deliberations of the MPC in February. While the market may be prepared to accept a standstill policy for now, any change in the RBI’s stance from accommodative to neutral may not go down well. A lot would also depend on the fiscal arithmetic that would emerge from the budget to be presented on February 1. Meanwhile, the government should engage all levers to address the supply-side issues that are behind the rise in food inflation. A calming down of food prices will help the bank do what the government and markets want — lower rates.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/inflation-shocker-on-rise-of-consumer-price-inflation/article30569603.ece
7,2020/01/15,"Tension on Bengaluru's Church Street over ‘Free Kashmir’, anti-CAA graffiti","Tension prevailed on Church Street on Tuesday after shopkeepers and locals woke up to see walls and shutters of a building covered with graffiti against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Another graffiti had ‘Free Kashmir’ scrawled across a wall. One graffiti, for instance, stated ‘No CAA, No NRC’ while another said: ‘I will not show my papers’.

According to the police, there were also abusive comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and the RSS. “This was done in the wee hours of Tuesday,” said the police, who have taken suo motu action.

As word spread, a group of people claiming to be BJP workers and members of the Bajrang Dal gathered at the spot with flags and shouted slogans against the perpetrators, demanding their immediate arrest. They also covered the graffiti with saffron and red colour. The situation got tense when a resident objected to them painting the wall. Sensing trouble, the police whisked him away from the spot.

Chetan Singh Rathore, DCP (Central division), who visited the spot, said that the police are analysing CCTV footage. “It was the act of two people. We are in the process of identifying them. The night beat patrol police have been questioned to ascertain whether they came across any suspicious activity while on their rounds,” said Mr. Rathore.

This is the second such incident of people using Church Street as a canvas to vent their anger. Last year, the police had detained two college students for painting graffiti on the walls to protest the crackdown on pubs and live music.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/z0sxxd/article30572185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGCAANRCGRAFFITTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tension-on-church-street-over-free-kashmir-anti-caa-graffiti/article30572186.ece
8,2020/01/15,BJP workers use saffron paint to cover graffiti outside Srishti art institute,"In two instances on Tuesday — one at Church Street and the other at Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology — the Bharatiya Janata Party workers allegedly covered graffiti with saffron paint on the grounds that they were offensive.

Outside Srishti, the BJP workers were led by Yelahanka BJP MLA S.R. Vishwanath.

Following the incident, the college management declared that it will remain closed on Thursday and Friday. The executive administrator in a mail to students, a copy of which is with The Hindu, stated that the holiday has been declared keeping in mind the “potential risk” to students and stated that the institute will be closed till Friday.

“We understand that these are difficult times and we will all walk and talk about the issues before us together,” read the email.

Narrating the sequence of events, a student of the institute said a group of people in civilian clothes arrived at the gate and started towing vehicles parked outside. “We asked them to stop but they did not listen and took the vehicles to the traffic police station Simultaneously, the group also put saffron paint on a graffiti which they interpreted as anti-Modi,” said a student who witnessed the incident. Neither the students nor the staff of the institute were able to confirm who drew the graffiti.

When contacted, Yelahanka BJP MLA, S.R. Vishwanath confirmed the events but defended the group’s action. He said they rushed to the campus after they received a complaint on the BBMP Sahaya app on Tuesday from a resident about vehicles blocking the campus. “At that time we saw a cartoon on Modi and I asked a few of my workers to paint it to avoid any controversy,” he said, adding that residents had been complaining about the students smoking in public places and using the parks in the neighbourhood even when they were closed.

Several Srishti students alleged that the MLA was using traffic police personnel to threaten them. However, the traffic police denied the allegations and said they only towed the vehicles away.

After this incident, there was a meeting with the students, administration and faculty. A student, who attended the meeting, stated that the college had urged them not to dissent publicly even artistically. “They told us to lie low and that they were worried about our safety. We were also told that the residents were involved in moral policing,” a student said.

Another student of the institute said they condemned the incident and that the students wanted to continue to express dissent over the CAA and the violence in educational institutions. “We want to be involved in the larger movement and hope that this does not prevent us from expressing our dissent,” the student said.

The college plans to have in-house discussions on CAA and NRC as planned earlier, which includes a series of talks by legal professionals on the issue. They have asked the students to follow the dress code, avoid being out late at night, avoid gathering in public and also not flout laws regarding smoking in public places.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/7z82b4/article30572180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGGRAFI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bjp-workers-use-saffron-paint-to-cover-graffiti-outside-srishti-art-institute/article30572181.ece

The rock memorial itself will be 36 feet in length. Iron, wood, bamboo, cement and sand have been used to create this rock memorial, which will have a moat-like structure.

M. Jagadeesh, Joint Director, said the 3.2 lakh flowers on the rock temple, 1.5 lakh flowers used for the floral representation of Swami Vivekandanda's famous speech in Chicago and over 40,000 saffron flowers used for the statue, will be changed twice during the 10-day flower show.

The other attractions include installation of over 100 boards that are 4 feet X 3 feet in dimension with information about Swami Vivekananda's life. Two large outdoor screens will be place – one in front of the Glass House and another at the Bonsai Circle – to screen documentaries.

A stage – Vivekananda Vedike – will be constructed. Here, the Vivekananda Sudhe programme will be held every day between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. when songs, especially those written by Kannada poets Kuvempu and G.S. Shivarudrappa about the saint will be performed by artistes.

The Horticulture Department has tied up with the Information and Broadcasting Department, and had brought out a booklet on the life of the saint.

More than 1,000 children from schools run by the Ramakrishna Mission will be dressed as Swami Vivekananda.“This is only for one day. The children will walk around Lalbagh, with their escorts, to create awareness among visitors, on the day of the inauguration,” said Mr. Jagadeesh.

Another speciality this year is that flowers from 10 different countries have been imported for the show. As many as 37 different species in 235 colour shades and patterns will be displayed. That apart, many varieties of temperate flowers from Ooty and Sikkim will be displayed.

Security arrangements

With over five lakh people expected to attend the Republic Day Flower Show, heavy security arrangements will be in place. More than 108 CCTV cameras will be installed across the botanical garden. Police will be deputed for the duration of the show along with Lalbagh's security personnel.

Extra security will be provided on holidays and weekends, when the footfall is likely to be more. Door frame metal detectors and hand-held metal detectors will be installed at all the entrances. A separate police post will be set up near the Glass House.

Free entry for children

Entry is free for school students during the flower show, except on January 17 (the day of inauguration), and weekends (January 19, 25 and 26). School buses can enter through the Double Road entrance. Joint Director M. Jagadeesh said the entrance fee for adults is ₹70 and children (aged below 12 years) is ₹20. Tickets for the flower show will also be available online on Bookmyshow to prevent crowding and queues at ticket counters.

Towards a litter-free show

Over the past few years, a serious effort has been made to ensure that the flower show is litter-free. The Horticulture Department has roped in solid waste management experts. Preliminary meetings were held with Hasiru Dala, Beautiful Bengaluru, and organisations promoting better waste management practices.

Wet and dry bins will be placed at appropriate places. Officials expressed hope that this year, the show will be plastic-free. Officials have appealed to visitors, shopkeepers and those manning stalls inside the botanical garden to not uses single-use disposables and plastic items.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/41xcep/article30572171.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGFLOWERSHOWVIVEK1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/lalbagh-flower-show-to-highlight-swami-vivekananda-and-his-work/article30572172.ece

The irony was not lost on motorists, many of who took to social media to vent their frustration.

Hundreds of vehicles coming towards the CBD from J.C. Road, Nrupatunga Road and Kasturba Road were stranded as buses were parked along the road to ferry the children back.

“It took me more than an hour to cover the little over-half-kilometre distance between Minerva Circle and Siddaiah junction. I missed an important meeting at 11.30 a.m.,” said Arun Sreenivas. According to motorists, the partial closure of Sirsi Circle flyover added to the chaos.

A special sub-inspector was injured during the raid after drunk men attacked him.

According to police, E.Sundaravathanam, Assistant Superintendent of Police, Mamallapuram, had ordered a crackdown on illegal dance bars and resorts in his jurisdiction.

On Sunday night, the DSP and his team comprising special sub-inspector Kuppuswamy spotted a few drunk men on the road on Sunday night.

During inquiry, they revealed that a party was going on in a beach house nearby. When the police tried to enter the house, they found the door locked. The team barged into the house. In the confusion, a few men escaped.

One of the employees of the beach house attacked Mr. Kuppuswamy. He was rushed to a hospital and is said to be out of danger.

13,2020/01/15,TNPSC criticised for rejecting SC candidate’s application,"The Madras High Court has criticised the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) for having adopted a “pedantic” approach in rejecting the candidature of a Scheduled Caste aspirant to the post of Civil Judge because of a delay in producing a valid community certificate from the Tahsildar of his village.

A Division Bench of Justices V. Bharathidasan and V. Parthiban said: “From the manner in which the Commission rejected the candidature of the petitioner in haste, does not show the Commission in good light as it is expected to adopt the principle of fairness in all its actions. The Commission’s decision appears to be too rash and apathetic.”

The judges also concurred with senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the candidate, that, “The Commission which is a premier recruiting agency in the State of Tamil Nadu, clothed with constitutional status, cannot abdicate its constitutional responsibility and deal with the claims of reserved candidates in such a cavalier fashion.”

Authoring the verdict, Justice Parthiban went on to state: “This is a fit case where the action of the Commission in rejecting the candidature of the petitioner should be discountenanced outright. The decision of the Commission, in the opinion of this court, is borne out of bureaucratic callousness and insensitivity.”

Pointing out that the Commission ought to have permitted the petitioner to continue to participate in the selection process after giving him sufficient time to produce the community certificate in a proper format, the judges set aside its order rejecting petitioner’s candidature and permitted him to participate.

The writ petition had been filed advocate A.K. Anand who had cleared both his preliminary and main examinations conducted in 2018.

Subsequently, he was provisionally selected for the viva-voce, when his certificates were also verified.

On verification, the officials found that the petitioner had submitted a community certificate issued by an authority in his temporary residence at Puducherry and not from his permanent residence in Villupuram. He obtained two weeks’ time to submit the certificate. However, it took a little longer to submit the certificate by when the Commission rejected his candidature.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tnpsc-criticised-for-rejecting-sc-candidates-application/article30570447.ece
14,2020/01/15,Nippy weather to prevail during Pongal,"Chennai will continue experiencing nippy weather for three days, as the minimum temperature is likely to drop a few notches.

The city recorded its coldest day so far in January this year, on Tuesday, when the minimum temperature dipped below 20 degrees Celsius.

In the last 24 hours, ending 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, weather stations in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam recorded 18.7 degrees Celsius and 18.2 degrees Celsius respectively — nearly 2.5 degrees Celsius less than the average for the month.

Many other places, such as Thanjavur, Tiruchi and Nagapattinam, also experienced a drop in night temperatures on Tuesday.

Meteorological Department officials said this was the second coldest temperature recorded in January after 2012. Chennai had recorded a minimum temperature of 17.7 degrees Celsius on January 17, 2012.

N. Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Chennai, said the minimum temperatures would be more in areas close to the coast, like Nungambakkam. Light northerly winds would prevail during the evenings, and the land would be chill, leading to a drop in the minimum temperature.

A cyclonic circulation over southwest Bay of Bengal, extending up to 1.5 km above the mean sea level, will influence light rain, he added.

Places like Chennai may experience slightly warm nights towards the weekend due to the weather system.

15,2020/01/15,"Invited for Pongal, murder suspect walks into police trap","A murder case suspect settled in Malaysia landed at the Tiruchi international airport on Monday to visit his native place for Pongal not knowing that he was walking into a trap laid by the police.

Little did Raghuvaran of Pudukottai district realise that the Crime Branch CID of Tamil Nadu police had solved the mystery of a missing woman and was on the lookout for him as a prime suspect in the case.

Soon after he arrived from Kuala Lumpur, investigators who had already issued a Look Out Circular, secured Raghuvaran in coordination with immigration officials.

On interrogation, the suspect admitted to having murdered Saranya, 27, who was reported missing on July 16, 2017, at the behest of her husband, Raja, and buried the body with the help of some accomplices.

Police dug up the area identified by him and exhumed the skeletal remains of the victim.

Saranya’s family members identified the saree and silver anklets she was wearing.

Saranya had got a divorce and the court ordered that their child should spend weekends with Raja. On the day she went missing, the woman went to hand over her child to the police to comply with the condition. Since there was no trace of her, the case was transferred from the local police to the Crime Branch CID.

At a review meeting last month, Director-General of Police Jaffar Sait instructed the investigating team to pursue the call details of the victim, her husband and look for suspicious numbers.

It was during this analysis that police zeroed in on a number that went mute since the day Saranya was reported missing.

Mobile lead

“The suspicious number went into switch-off mode and then got deactivated. But another number to which the suspect had made a phone call was active. It was this lead that led us to Raghuvaran, who had by then moved to Malaysia and settled there. We sought the help of some relatives to invite him home for Pongal and he came,” a senior investigator said.

Raja had requested Raghuvaran to eliminate Saranya. On July 16, 2017, Raghuvaran picked her from the police station and promised to negotiate an amicable settlement with Rajan.

He then drove her to a secluded place, where Raja and three other suspects were waiting.

16,2020/01/15,"Corporation teams put out fires in 2,277 locations","Teams from the Chennai Corporation on Tuesday put out fires and seized large quantities of materials meant for burning during Bhogi.

Officials have been collecting fines, ranging from ₹1,000-2,000, from people burning waste in the open, in the last few months.

‘Govt.’s reputation’

On Tuesday, owing to Bhogi, civic body officials were directed not to collect fines from violators of the Chennai Solid Waste Management Bylaws, 2019, to “avoid damage to the reputation of the State government” during Pongal season.

However, teams of Corporation officials were directed to put out fires in areas where complaints were received from residents about rising levels of pollution.

“Last year, pollution was very high and flights were diverted. As a result, we planned to make a public announcement of the amount of fine to residents, a day ahead of Bhogi. However, the announcement was not made,” said an official.

Officials formed 46 special teams to control burning of material during Bhogi, in all 15 zones of the city. “We inspected 2,277 places where major fires were reported in the city. We created awareness on smokeless Bhogi for residents,” said an official.

Awareness programmes on smokeless Bhogi was conducted at 5,245 locations. Sholinganallur zone reported the largest number of awareness programmes on smokeless Bhogi. Residents in 2,700 locations in Sholinganallur agreed to celebrate smokeless Bhogi this year, officials said.

A total of 28 tonnes of tyres were seized from residents of the city. Some 7,535 kg of tyres was seized from Kodambakkam, the largest quantity seized in the city. Just 10 kg of tyres was seized in Tiruvottiyur.

17,2020/01/15,"Protests, demonstrations prohibited in Chennai for 15 days","Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan has promulgated an order under Section 41 of Tamilnadu City Police Act 1888, regulating/prohibiting assemblies, processions, fasts, demonstrations, human chain and meetings within the city for 15 days from Monday.

The order said Mr. Viswanathan had acted on reports that fasts, protests, demonstrations were likely to be held in city’s thoroughfares, which may result in obstruction to free flow of traffic, cause inconvenience to general public/VIPS and disruption of law and order.

However, senior advocate R. Vaigai said, “There seems to be no application of mind in this. It seems to be a politically motivated, blanket prohibition that has been issued. I don’t think it is legally tenable at all. It is a blanket order which does not give any reason for its promulgation. The Commissioner’s order does not actually say that there is any threat to public peace or safety on account of events that are proposed.”

This order shall not apply to any assembly or procession or demonstration for which permission had already been granted.

“Any assembly or procession purely for the purpose of taking part in sports, or on occasion of wedding, funeral or similar domestic occurrence will not come under the regulation.” The order further said “applicants are advised to apply for grant of permission at least five days in advance.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gg8x33/article26915702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23APRTHCHENNAIRIFLECLUBLAUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/protests-demonstrations-prohibited-for-15-days/article30570418.ece
18,2020/01/15,Bhogi’s place in Tamil tradition,"Bhogi and the festival of Pongal have become inseparable. The burning of old goods and the beating of drums mark Bhogi in Chennai and a few other places. But scholars differ on its place in Tamil history and tradition.

“Even today, the tradition is not followed in many places outside Chennai. Bhogi has a north Indian origin. Of course, houses are white-washed and old goods and vessels are discarded. Cracks in walls and damaged courtyards are mended. But I have not witnessed the burning of goods in the name of Bhogi elsewhere,” said V. Arasu, former Head of the Tamil Department at the University of Madras.

He said though references to cleaning and refurbishing ahead of Pongal could be found in Tamil literature, seldom was the practice referred to as Bhogi.

“Tamil culture has nothing to do with the celebration or worship of fire. It is normally seen in north India, and is probably [a means] to beat the cold climate,” Mr. Arasu explained.

A few scholars have, however, sought to prove the existence of Bhogi in Tamil society by interpreting the word to give a symbolic meaning.

Symbolic meaning

Tamil scholar T. Gnanasundaram said the reference to ‘Indira Vizha’ in the ancient Tamil epic Silappathikaram could probably connote the Bhogi festival. “Indiran is a bhogi (an epicurean of sorts), and is also considered the God of rain. Rain is everything for an agrarian society,” he said.

T. Dharmaraj, Professor and Head of the Department, Folklore and Cultural Studies, Madurai Kamaraj University, argued that there was a place for Bhogi in Tamil Buddhist tradition.

“Pandit Iyothee Doss (a 19th-century Tamil scholar who espoused the cause of the depressed classes) claimed that Buddhist monks lived in Pothigai Hills, and the word could have originated from there. ‘Bhogi’ means burning all impure thoughts in one’s mind,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bflc56/article30570392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THBHOGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bhogis-place-in-tamil-tradition/article30570393.ece
19,2020/01/15,The long wait for empowered mayors,"As he attempts to repeat the overwhelming 2015 victory of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the Delhi Assembly election, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is challenging political Goliaths on just one plank: his government’s performance.

The face of changes

The iconoclast who overran Delhi’s established political trenches with an anti-corruption campaign is pinning his hopes on the unprecedented fiscal measures he has taken to change the paradigm of education, health and urban development in the National Capital. In office, he has pressed on even in the face of non-cooperation from the Central Government, which controls important departments providing civic services mainly through the Urban Development and Home Ministries.

The AAP’s annual budget five years ago raised the outlay for education by 106% over the previous year’s plan of ₹2,219 crore, and focused on building 20,000 additional classrooms. It sent government teacher-mentors abroad for training to modernise the system. Shiny classrooms, new teaching tools and eager students changed the public view of government schools as decrepit dungeons.

Delhi’s ambitious budgets for development stand apart from those of other cities, and built the Chief Minister’s reputation more as a super Mayor in a city-State. The 2015 education outlay was no flash in the pan. Four years later, it was 27.8%, says an analysis by PRS Legislative Research, and continues to tower over the States that average 15.8%. For health, the allocation of 13.8% dwarfs the 5.2% that others spend on average, and Delhi’s Mohalla Clinics — to provide coverage to all within a range of 1 km — are seen by public health researchers as a good model for a national universal health coverage programme. In budget 2019-20, the highest increase was for transport, at 38%, raising hopes of reduced pollution partly through support for electric vehicles. Municipal budgets for 2014-15 analysed by Open Budgets India reflect a similar trend for urban education expenditure vis-à-vis Delhi. On the income side, cities collect far less property tax than they should due to undervaluation and lack of scientific assessment.

Although he is criticised for his style of functioning, the AAP leader does not have his back to the wall and is pushing to extend his authority, fighting the Central Government’s attempts to clip his wings. This is not the situation in other big metropolitan cities, which cannot aspire to have strong leadership due to the prevailing system.

Hardly empowered; a ‘threat’

Metros have been deprived of empowered Mayors who can raise efficiency, productivity and liveability. Mayors in many global cities go on to lead their country, which possibly explains why they have been reduced to obscure, ceremonial figures by national parties in India.

The Economic Survey of 2017-18 notes that a third of the population now lives in urban areas which produce three-fifths of the GDP. But India’s overflowing cities lack capacity, infrastructure and leadership. The Survey acknowledges this, attributing it to the absence of a single city government in charge, and low spending on infrastructure. State governments amass the large economic output from urban agglomerations, but are averse to a strong Mayoral system.

Chief Ministers see a potential threat from a charismatic and empowered Mayor with progressive policies. Some of them have used the excuse of poor performance of urban local bodies as a justification to replace direct election of Mayors with an indirect system. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government in Tamil Nadu issued an ordinance last year to amend the law, and remove any possibility of prominent Opposition politicians becoming the face of any big city. The memory of M.K. Stalin, son of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader M. Karunanidhi as a high-profile Mayor in Chennai even after a quarter century is obviously still fresh. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi refreshingly promised ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha poll that he would support directly-elected Mayors, since smart cities depend on good leaders.

Weakening governance

In some States, elections to urban local bodies have not been held for years, defeating the lofty goal of decentralised governance. Tamil Nadu is a prominent example. The idea of giving more authority to the third tier of governance has suffered serious stunting, in spite of the 74th Constitution Amendment Act of 1992 identifying 18 local level functions to be devolved, including planning for economic and social development, regulation of land, construction of buildings, urban planning and public health. The average of subjects devolved in all these years is nine, and does not include the major municipal services which continue to be run by parastatal authorities that answer to State governments. Newer devices used to bypass local bodies and priorities are styled as special schemes, such as urban renewal and smart cities, directly supervised by the Central government and partnered by State governments.

Several States are averse to directly-elected Mayors even for their biggest cities, in spite of the Mayor being deprived of any significant powers. The appointment of the executive in-charge, the Municipal Commissioner is a good example. Empowered Mayors, such as those in New York, Paris, London or even Shanghai, could steal the limelight through spectacular successes, leaving Chief Ministers and legislators with little direct connect with urban voters.

Even on a salient issue such as climate change, Mayors are much in demand. The Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, assumed the leadership of the climate movement in iconic ways, with a move to prescribe green roofs in the vast French capital capturing the public imagination worldwide. Mr. Kejriwal is alert to the global traction that climate change is getting, and addressed Mayors gathered in Copenhagen via video link last year, because the Central government refused him permission to attend. The AAP Health Minister was similarly denied permission to go to Australia to explain the working of Mohalla Clinics.

The present system, of course, does not help directly-elected Mayors. They have not been able to raise service delivery standards, regardless of long or short tenure, and the poor outcomes are quite evident, as the Economic Survey points out. Ironically, because powerless Mayors have running battles with municipal councillors, States such as Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, to name just two, abandoned direct elections to the post.

The Annual Survey of India’s City-Systems (ASICS) 2017 covering 23 cities across 20 States published by Janaagraha Centre for Citizenship and Democracy found 33% of medium and large cities with a provision for directly-elected Mayors, but none in the mega cities. A tenure of five years for Mayors is available only in a fifth of the biggest cities, and half of urban Indians live in cities where Mayors can be in office for just two-and-a-half years, ASICS found.

Unified governance and empowerment through elected municipal systems is a distant prospect, but the Central government glibly claimed at the UN Habitat Conference in Quito, Ecuador, in 2016, that the 74th Amendment had made Indian cities self-governing entities with adequate powers and financial autonomy. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth, but then the statement was made by the Secretary to the Union Ministry of Housing. At the conference plenary, the Indian statement did not contain any reference to Mayors.

Hampering development

Much hard work must be done, before cities can progress beyond John Kenneth Galbraith’s famous description of India as a “functioning anarchy”. Government departments will feel accountable for urban services and infrastructure only under the watch of an empowered leader, who enjoys the mandate of the city’s residents.

A lot of time has been lost, as recalcitrant State leaders, who often have remote rural bases of support, stymie the pace of orderly urban development. Lack of coherence in government is hindering better productivity, and causing losses through pollution, congestion and poor outcomes on infrastructure investments. The priorities are flawed, the administration is fragmented and the capacity of city governments is low.

In the coming decade, progress on Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the UN Habitat New Urban Agenda will come under close international scrutiny. India’s cities need a new deal, one that is focused on development. Only elected, empowered and accountable Mayors can deliver on that.

20,2020/01/15,Shape of a movement,"We ought to have realised by now that an inclusive ethos is too deeply ingrained in the Indian mind. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, is being seen in the perspective of the National Population Register-National Register of Citizens, and there is not much to find fault with this perception. The fact is that the common man is truly apprehensive. This policy-troika now under way appears to delineate differences where none should exist. And this is precisely what has fuelled the peoples’ agitation. The government is yet to proceed beyond parsing a conciliatory sentence, much less open a dialogue. The deterioration in the economy and employment is only adding to the angst.

R. Narayanan,

Navi Mumbai

The protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, are now drifting without a credible face to anchor them and are becoming more sporadic in nature. One also has the government in its wisdom reluctant to talk to anyone to clear misgivings in the minds of people and also getting away in the process on account of its sheer and brute majority in Parliament. It seems to have forgotten that in a democracy, debate and discussion are essential. It is saddening that there is no meeting ground between the protesters and the government to sort out the issues and saving the country from the continuing chaos and disruptions. There has to be a focus on steps to ensure progress and prosperity.

V. Padmanabhan,

Bengaluru

The writer, in her eagerness to romanticise the anti-CAA protests as a massive popular uprising against the government, has glossed over the unfolding silent backlash against the perceived excesses of the protests (Editorial page, “Sparkling people, a spiritless Opposition”, January 14). That the pro-CAA support has been muted does not mean the silent majority has endorsed the streak of intolerance that permeated the street protests in the initial phase. The Opposition has developed cold feet after going overboard in fanning the flames of discord because the milking of political capital is an exercise fraught with electoral risks. There is no denying the fact that the anti-CAA protests have gained a sectarian streak. The neutral observers who have been following the anti-CAA bandwagon see the waving of the national flag not as a spontaneous outburst of the pluralist sentiment; they consider it as a belated attempt to blunt the growing perception that opposition to a law is a mere front for spewing hatred against an elected government. The attempt to depict the protests as the fight between a community and the government was a dangerous narrative that upset those who seem willing to accept the articulation of the CAA as positive discrimination in favour of persecuted people who have cultural links with the nation.

Can we not come up with a model wherein illegal buildings can be put to better use instead of literally being bombed to dust? So much of energy wasted. Such a loss of resources, and so much pollution.

We certainly need to rethink laws and penalties (Inside pages, “Maradu demolition decision a painful duty: SC” and “Dust from debris leaves neighbours breathless”, both January 14).

26,2020/01/15,"Congress hits back, dubs Udayanraje ‘Ajanata Raja’","Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant on Tuesday took a dig at Chhatrapati Shivaji’s descendant and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Udayanraje Bhosale by calling him Ajanata Raja. Mr. Sawant said the people of the State do not take criticism by him seriously.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Bhosale, a former Lok Sabha MP of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) from Satara, had attacked the Shiv Sena-NCP-Congress alliance for criticising the BJP over a booklet comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the 17th century Maratha warrior king.

Mr. Bhosale made the comments at the behest of the BJP, Mr. Sawant said, adding that it was not yet clear why he joined the saffron party, which allegedly committed a “scam” in the Shivaji memorial work and “insulted” the warrior king by comparing him to Mr. Modi.

“Mr. Bhosale is an Ajanata Raja [a king who does not know anything about his subjects]... Mavalas [foot soldiers of Shivaji] like us have proceeded on the path shown by Shivaji Maharaj in a true sense,” Mr. Sawant said.

King Shivaji is hailed as Janata Raja, a king who knows everything about his subjects and understands them. “The descendant of Shivaji Maharaj, however, is following Modi’s path. Hence, the people of Maharashtra will not pay heed to him and not take the criticism by him seriously,” he said.

Condemning the booklet, Mr. Bhosale had said, “I never gave any remuneration to the author to write that booklet. So those who are seeking my stand or clarification, I will show them their place,” he said.

When asked whether he was going to speak to the BJP high command and seek action against the author, Mr. Bhosale said he would do so. “But I have come to know that the author has withdrawn the book...Forget about the book, even the author can be withdrawn,” he said.

Taking a swipe at the ruling alliance, he said, “These people are only after power. They think about petty issues like municipal elections. They cannot stay together for a long. Once their motives are achieved, they will go on their own ways.”

Mr. Bhosale said it was sad that people in the country are fighting for meals even 70 years after Independence. “What have you achieved in a democracy? Had there been a rajeshahi, I tell you no one would have lived without food,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/p43gz9/article30572354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMAAJKESHIVAJI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/congress-hits-back-dubs-udayanraje-ajanata-raja/article30572355.ece
27,2020/01/15,‘Comparing Modi to Shivaji height of sycophancy’,"The Shiv Sena on Tuesday dubbed the booklet comparing Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Chhatrapati Shivaji “height of hypocrisy and sycophancy” and asserted that Mr. Modi is “not the king of India”.

Advising Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders to read some books on Chhatrapati Shivaji, an editorial in the Shiv Sena mouthpiece, Saamana, said even Prime Minister Modi would not have liked being compared to the Maratha warrior king.

The Marathi publication, however, said the “wave of anger” in Maharashtra was against the booklet, titled Aaj Ke Shivaji: Narendra Modi, and not the Prime Minister. The booklet, written by BJP leader Jay Bhagwan Goyal, has created a political storm in the State, where king Shivaji is revered.

‘Insulting reference’

The Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress, part of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government, have criticised the booklet for comparing Mr. Modi to king Shivaji Maharaj and termed it “insulting”.

“The wave of anger is not against Modiji but against the book, which in itself is height of hypocrisy and sycophancy,” the Sena said in its mouthpiece. “He is a popular Prime Minister of the country and known to be a decisive leader. Even after this if you ask whether Mr. Modi is the king of India, the answer is ‘no’,” it said.

“Before the Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Modi was described as an incarnation of lord Vishnu. Now he is called the Shivaji Maharaj of this era. Such sycophancy not only results in insult of the country, god and religion, but also puts Mr. Modi also into an awkward situation,” the editorial said.

Suggesting that BJP leaders based in Delhi read some books on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the Sena said they need to understand the history of Maharashtra as 11 crore people of the State do not like the comparison between Mr. Modi and the Maratha king.

The BJP leaders from the State should openly condemn such a move, the editorial said. “We appreciate that the descendants of Shivaji Maharaj have expressed their disappointment over the book,” it added.

‘Bootlickers to blame’

28,2020/01/15,"Missing teen, friend found in Dehradun","The missing teenager from Taloja, who has accused Deputy Inspector General (Motor Transport), Pune, Nishikant More, of molestation, was traced to Dehradun on Tuesday, after a week. “She was found from Dehradun. Our team brought her here around 5 p.m. on Tuesday. Her friend, who had gone missing from Kharghar the same day, has also been found. Further details will be revealed at a press conference on Wednesday,” Navi Mumbai police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar said. The girl had left home on the night of January 6, leaving behind a note, saying she is disturbed because of Mr. More and was going to commit suicide.

Police sources said after leaving home around 11.30 p.m., she met the boy near Taloja railway line. They went to Tilak Nagar and boarded a train to Allahabad, where the boy’s sister lives. They left after a few days and on Monday night, she called her family and said she was at Dehradun. A police team along with her family left for Dehradun and brought her back. “We are recording her statement and are yet to register any case against the boy,” an officer from Taloja police station said. Meanwhile, Mr. More has moved the High Court for anticipatory bail after it was rejected by the Panvel sessions court.

“I would ask the police to file a case against the family. In all this ‘missing drama’ my husband was no where involved and yet his bail got cancelled because she went missing. We are suffering because of this family,” Knishika More, wife of Mr. More said. Meanwhile several calls to the family of the victim, went unanswered.

On December 25, the victim had registered a case of molestation with Taloja police against Mr. More alleging that he had molested her in June during her birthday celebration at her residence.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/missing-teen-friend-found-in-dehradun/article30570778.ece
29,2020/01/15,"GST Bhavan, Wadala station to be merged","The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is planning to integrate its Metro station at Wadala with the proposed GST Bhavan.

At a joint meeting with several top officials of the State and MMRDA, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday suggested that different departments work together so neither project is affected. Mr. Pawar also suggested that the Eastern Freeway be named after former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh.

Senior MMRDA officials said there were issues with regards to land for the proposed Metro station, which was conflicting with the State’s proposals to build a GST Bhavan. “It was suggested that the building would be jointly designed in such a way that the concourse level of the Metro station will be integrated with the podium of the GST Bhavan,” an official said. The station is part of Metro Line 4, which will run from Wadala to Thane. The GST Bhavan is expected to cater to nearly 10,000 people every day and the new arrangement would benefit those commuting to it daily.

Mr. Pawar also instructed officials to start the process to rename the Eastern Freeway after Deshmukh, who he said had given a vision for the development of the city and under whose tenure the freeway was built.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will launch the first girder of the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link on Wednesday. He also reviewed various education projects and suggested setting up virtual classrooms in State schools and giving an emphasis on e-learning. He suggested that the digital learning process be started by evaluation and standardisation of education and preparing virtual classrooms to remove regional imbalances.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gst-bhavan-wadala-station-to-be-merged/article30570768.ece

The underground corridor, which is being built from Colaba to SEEPZ, has 26 stations out of which MMRCL has completed the excavation work at 13. It plans to complete the excavation work of the remaining stations by May.

“Now further activities like construction of the station boxes, which is already under way, will take shape. The excavation for the remaining 13 stations is being undertaken on war footing and will be completed in three to four months.

31,2020/01/15,"CCTV footage, security guard help identify teacher’s killer","CCTV camera footage and the statement of a witness helped the police identify the murderer of Bhandup resident Yasmita Salunke immediately after the accused’s suicide.

Salunke (37), a physical training instructor with Vani Vidyalaya in Mulund, was bludgeoned to death in the parking lot of Vaktratunda Palace building in Bhandup on Monday morning. Around 8 p.m. the same day, the prime suspect, Kishore Sawant, was found to have killed himself in the compound of his building.

Immediately after Salunke’s murder, the police viewed CCTV footage to try and get a picture of the accused. He was identified with the help of a security guard at the building, who had witnessed the entire incident.

Another security guard, who did not wish to be named, said, “We saw Sawant assault Salunke on the live feed and went running to the parking lot. We even tried to catch him but he managed to dodge us and ran away.” While the police were circulating the suspect’s photograph, they received a call about Sawant’s suicide at Kalpataru Crest building, which is 500 m away from Salunke’s residence.

“Sawant’s face seemed familiar and we compared it with the CCTV stills. To be sure, we also called the security guard who had witnessed the murder and he confirmed that it was the same man,” senior police inspector Sham Shinde, Bhandup police station, said.

Mr. Shinde said the motive behind the murder still remains a mystery. Sawant did not leave behind a suicide note and no other concrete information has come to light so far.

Meanwhile, around 100 students and alumni of Vani Vidyalaya gathered at Salunke’s residence on Tuesday to bid a teary adieu to their teacher. Her body was handed over to her family at 3.45 p.m. after post-mortem examination and the students had already gathered in the compound when it arrived. The school had also declared a holiday.

“I learned about the incident on Monday evening and it is still hard for me to believe that the one teacher who would always help every student is no longer going to be around,” Jay Chandra, a Class X student, said .

Jebish Augustian, an ex-student, remembers Salunke as one of the most popular teachers at the school. “Students trained by her in kabbadi won the first runners-up prize at a district-level match last year,” he recalled.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xj0w7n/article30570734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bmBhandup-murder,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cctv-footage-security-guard-help-identify-teachers-killer/article30570736.ece
32,2020/01/15,When kites and spirits soared in Mira Road,"The Wockhardt Hospital in Mira Road celebrated Makar Sankranti by organising a kite flying programme for its patients on Tuesday.

The event, which began at 4.30 p.m. at the Joggers’ Park near Mira Road railway station, witnessed participation from around 20 autistic children, along with cardiac and orthopaedic patients.

Dr. Pankaj Dhamija, centre head of Wockhardt Hospital Mira Road said that the underlying objective behind the event was to pledge to move the patients away from ailments and towards better health.

“This is in sync with the significance of the festival, which stands for moving from darkness towards light. We organised this event especially for autistic children, as they do not enjoy the same inclusion in society as the othes do. On the other hand, the cardiac patients represent the spirit of never giving up,” Dr. Dhamija said.

Dr. Rajita Masram, a paediatric physiotherapist at the hospital, said she dealt with both physical and psychological defects of her patients.

“We have created this environment for the children to register things, to come out of their own world and start noticing things happening around them,” she said.

Several parents watched with joy as their children mingled amongst each other and enjoyed the festival, with even the other hospital staff members joining in.

The youngest participant was Kiaan Shaikh (2), who has been suffering from Pierre Robin Sequence since birth. The condition causes the tongue to roll back into the throat due to a smaller than usual lower jaw, which, in turn, causes difficulty in breathing.

His mother Karishma said, “My son had breathing issues since the day he was born but doctors took one month to figure out that he was suffering from Pierre Robin Sequence. They stitched his tongue to his lip to prevent it from rolling back into his throat. Now that he is two years old, we are working on his speech.”

Farida Chunawala, whose son Maaz (9) suffers from Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder expressed happiness at the fact that the hospital was trying to get the children to actively participate in social events.

“The hospital had organised a similar event on Holi last year and the children really enjoyed it. In fact, they still remember it. This is the first time Maaz is flying a kite and it is such a joy to watch him,” Ms. Chunawala said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lu6p6a/article30570726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMWOCKHARDT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/when-kites-and-spirits-soared-in-mira-road/article30570727.ece
33,2020/01/15,CM intervenes in Wadia Hospitals row,"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday directed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the State government to pay ₹46 crore to to Wadia Hospitals in order to ensure it remains open.

Mr. Thackeray called for a meeting to discuss the ongoing tussle between the hospital management and the BMC. Several political parties and labour unions had appealed to the government to intervene and to keep the hospitals running, as they are among the very few affordable hospitals in the city.

“Of the ₹46 crore to be given to the hospitals, the State will pay ₹24 crore while the rest will be paid by the BMC. The hospitals will not close,” said an official who attended the meeting.

Among those who attended the meeting were Wadia Group chairperson Nusli Wadia, officials from the health and civic department and Deputy CM and Finance Minister Ajit Pawar.

On Tuesday, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray’s wife, Sharmila, met Mr. Pawar. “He has agreed to provide the funds and the hospitals will not close,” she said later.

‘Temporary solution’

Labour union leader Prakash Reddy, who was with Ms. Thackeray during the meeting, said this was a temporary solution by the government.

“Apart from ₹46 crore, the labourers are yet to get delayed payment worth ₹10.1 crore. Mr. Pawar has agreed to hold another meeting with us after seven days where a permanent solution will be discussed,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cm-intervenes-in-wadia-hospitals-row/article30570725.ece
34,2020/01/15,BMC to pay ₹22 crore to Wadia Hospitals,"With political pressure to save Wadia Hospitals mounting on it, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to pay the hospital ₹22 crore due to it. The decision was taken in Tuesday’s standing committee meeting. However, members have demanded a detailed audit of the hospital accounts.

According to a trust deed signed between the hospitals and BMC in 1926, the civic body pays 100% subsidy to the Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children and 50% to the Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital every quarter. A committee formed by the BMC to look into the affairs of the hospitals had found serious irregularities late last year, owing to which the civic body decided to hold back around 10% of the amount due to it.

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani on Monday said the hospital management had not provided information about the number of beds set aside for mill workers’ families, despite being mandated to reserve 50% beds. Both hospitals had increased the number of beds from sanctioned strength without permission, he had said.

The BMC has alleged that the management has recruited more staff than permissible, and it is not providing free treatment and is instead charging twice or thrice the municipal rates. It has claimed that at least six senior officers are receiving salaries and allowances for both hospitals. The civic body has further alleged that at least 10 staffers are receiving pension from both hospitals, and the BMC has not been submitted any records to show the hospitals’ revenue.

There are also differences between the trust and the BMC over the total amount due to the hospital. The hospital management claims the BMC owes it ₹137 crore, while the BMC claims it only owes ₹22 crore.

Following complaints of irregularities, the BMC held back the money from its December payment. After the payment was halted, the management claimed that patients were being turned away and the hospital may shut down. Current and retired staffers then staged a protest.

The issue was brought up in the standing committee meeting by the Shiv Sena’s Vishakha Raut, who took a point of order. Ms. Raut said the leader of opposition, Ravi Raja, had taken up the matter in December, but was neglected by the administration.

BJP corporator Prabhakar Shinde said, “Despite the BMC giving money to the BEST, there hasn’t been much change on ground as there is no effective monitoring. In this case too, it kept giving money without auditing records.”

Following a debate, Mr. Kakani said the BMC only owes Wadia Hospitals ₹22 crore. Considering patient welfare, committee chairman Yashwant Jadhav directed the administration to release this amount immediately. However, the BMC has refused to recognise the beds and staff added by the hospital without its approval.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bycmc0/article30570722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-to-pay-22-cr-to-wadia-hospitals/article30570723.ece
35,2020/01/15,Mumbai losing faith in Budget: Milind Deora,"Congress leader and former Lok Sabha MP from South Mumbai Milind Deora has urged Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to visit the country’s commercial capital ahead of the February 1 Union Budget, to get a true picture of the state of the economy.

“Restricting policy-making only to the select few who have access to New Delhi reeks of arrogance and imprudence,” Mr. Deora said in a statement on Tuesday, arguing it is still not too late to make amends.

Recalling his meetings with foreign investors across sectors, and traditional market participants such as small traders, jewellers and clothes merchants, he sensed a feel of helplessness among them when it comes to policy formulation.

“So acute is the air of despondency that Mumbai is losing faith in India’s most important economic policy exercise,” Mr. Deora said in his plea that comes on the back of official estimates pegging growth this year at just 5% even as consumer price inflation has touched a five-and-a-half year high at 7.35%.

“Once the world’s fastest growing economy, India is coming dangerously close to going off the rails. The sputtering economy needs urgent attention and radical changes to avert a crisis… India’s stagnating growth story is pushing us to the periphery of the world’s investment radar,” he said.

The recent social unrest across the country has also dented India’s image as a socially and politically stable country conducive to doing business, the former MP said. Stressing that the government alone cannot find solutions to the ‘deepening crisis’, Mr. Deora said it is necessary that policy makers engage better with the economic capital amidst such extraordinary times.

“By now, India’s Finance Minister should have visited Mumbai to meet with representatives of traditional markets, Micro Small and Medium Enterprises, industry captains and representatives from banking and finance… If the Ministry of Finance is sincere about presenting an inclusive, representative and impactful Union Budget on February 1, it is still not too late for the Finance Minister to lend a patient ear to all stakeholders, so that their suggestions may be considered and acted upon in the economic interest of the nation,” Mr. Deora said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/god8ao/article30570719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07BMMILINDDEORA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-losing-faith-in-budget-milind-deora/article30570720.ece
36,2020/01/15,Young ‘traffic cops’ will ensure elders follow rules,"Navi Mumbai traffic police has started an initiative to involve students and post them as ‘family traffic cop’ to make sure their families follow the traffic rules.

“Children will help traffic police in educating their families in following traffic rules. The young ‘cops’ will be demoted if their family’s vehicles are found to be involved in traffic violation cases,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (traffic) Sunil Lokhande said.

Talking about the initiative at the launch of Road Safety Week, Navi Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Kumar said, “I have lost trust in parents and my hope is on children to educate them about traffic rules. In 2018, a total of 258 people died in road accidents and 40 people were killed in murder cases. If the number was vice verse, I would have had to resign as commissioner because people would question about 258 murders in society but not about 258 deaths in accident.”

Panvel RTO Lakshman Darade, who was recently awarded by Chief Minister for having the maximum reduction in accidental deaths, said, “In cases of death due to accident, maximum victims are the bread earners of the family.”

He added, “Those accidents happen due to silly human neglects. In a year the country suffers ₹70,000 crore of loss of property. In the year 2018, Raigad witnessed 698 accidents which killed 302 and in 2019, 992 accidents which killed 216. Supreme Court has given direction to reduce accidental deaths by 10% and we managed to bring it down by 38%, making us first in the State to do so. We have suspended the license of 1,873 motorists who flouted traffic rules.”

Mr. Lokhande further said that in a year, 1.50 lakh people die in accidents in country which means 377 die daily and one in every four minutes. By following rules, 80% of accidental deaths can be reduced.”

In 2019, Navi Mumbai collected ₹7.42 crore as fine for violation of traffic rules. Mr. Kumar said the department aims to reduce accidents by self-realisation and education. For the ‘family traffic cop’ initiative, police has compiled a book which basic road safety information for Class VI to VIII students. They will appear for a road safety exam and then assigned as ‘family traffic cop’ with a badge, a pass and a certificate. Starting with a red badge, the student will be promoted to amber and green badges if their family is not found to have flouted any traffic rule. If the family is found to have flouted a rule thrice, the student will be demoted.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/x93qci/article30570712.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BM-road-safety,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/young-traffic-cops-will-ensure-elders-follow-rules/article30570713.ece

The total number of accidents in 2019 was 744, down from 1,203 in 2018. “E-challans have helped us curb accidents to a great extent. The CCTVs automatically generate e-challans. Besides, we are also using e-challans to penalise those caught flouting rules by our personnel. Our initiative on ‘campus with helmet’ has reached 121 campuses including, commercial spaces and colleges. We will soon be approaching housing societies and put up boards saying that no person on two-wheeler would be allowed inside without helmets,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Sunil Lokhande told The Hindu.

38,2020/01/15,Three from Mumbai held for ‘Jamtara’ racket; mastermind at large,"Even as the recent Netflix release Jamtara is gaining popularity among Indian viewers for its portrayal of phishing rackets, the DB Marg police have busted a similar racket in the city, which was being run by a native of the city in Jharkhand. The police have arrested three operatives of the main accused from Mumbai and seized 70 mobile phones bought with the proceeds of the crime.

According to the police, inquiries were first initiated into the racket when Anil Shah (73) registered a complaint saying that he had lost ₹1.7 lakh to a phishing racket. Officers said the racket made use of TeamViewer, an app that lets one person view another person’s phone screen as long as both the phones have the app and necessary permissions are enabled.

Pukhraj Suthar

“Mr. Shah got a text message on December 17 saying that his Paytm wallet had been disabled as he had not updated his KYC data. The message had a number which he was supposed to call, and on calling, the person at the other end told him to download TeamViewer first so that his account could be enabled again,” an officer with the DB Marg police said.

The officer said acting on the accused’s instructions, Mr. Shah enabled permissions for the accused to view his cell phone screen. The accused had already obtained his account details, including his PIN number, for the “KYC update” process and initiated an online purchase. When the bank sent an OTP to Mr. Shah’s phone, the accused could view it through TeamViewer and used it to purchase cash vouchers from stores like Big Bazaar and Croma worth ₹1.7 lakh.

Narsi Suthar

“We traced the digital footprint of the cash vouchers and zeroed in on the Big Bazaar outlet in Ghatkopar, from where the vouchers were used to purchase six cell phones. We then viewed CCTV footage of the store to identify the accused and kept a watch on the store. On January 6, we nabbed Narsi (23) and Nandkishore Suthar (26) when they came back to buy more cell phones,” the officer said.

Based on their interrogation, the police went on to arrest Pukhraj Suthar (23) from Lower Parel on January 7. The trio allegedly confessed that they would sell the cell phones to retail stores around the city at their market price. Over the next seven days, the police recovered 70 cell phones that the accused had sold. As the phones were still in their packing and the accused had proper bills, the retailers did not suspect that they were buying proceeds of a crime.

Nandkishore Suthar

“The three have said they were working on the instructions of a mastermind based in Jamtara and efforts are under way to identify and apprehend him. We have also asked all other police stations in the city to notify us about any similar offences registered within their jurisdiction, so that we can check if the trio are involved in those cases as well,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/16g8w4/article30570653.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bm-seized-cellphones,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/three-from-city-held-for-jamtara-racket-mastermind-at-large/article30570654.ece
39,2020/01/15,Bombay HC refuses to grant ad-interim relief to broadcasters,"The Bombay High Court on Tuesday refused to grant ad-interim relief to Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) and general entertainment channels who have challenged the latest amendments to the sector tariffs by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing a bunch of petitions filed by the Film and Television Producers Guild of India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited, Sony Pictures Networks, IBF, Disney Board, Asianet Star Communication and Star India against TRAI on January 13.

On January 1, 2020, the regulatory authority introduced new rules that reduces the cost of a channel from the existing ₹19 to ₹12 for the television broadcasters. The reduced price ceiling was to be included in their pack by January 15.

According to TRAI, subscribers are not choosing a-la-carte channels on account of bouquets being available at a discounted rate. In their petition, the IBF has said, “a normal Indian family is likely to choose one or more bouquets that would provide all such genres of channels as opposed to choosing a-la-carte channels of each category. It is submitted that consumer’s choice of TV channels is based on personal and demographic preferences such as age, sex, culture etc.”

The petition further mentions that, “it is manifestly arbitrary to unilaterally and without any application of mind whatsoever, reduce the price cap on the maximum price that a channel can be priced at in order to qualify being made part of a bouquet. There is especially not justification given to reduce the price ceiling.”

The common contentions are that such a restriction impinges the fundamental right guaranteed to them under Article 19 1 a (to freedom of speech and expression) and 19 1 g (to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business) of the petitioners and that any restriction on these rights have to be reasonable. However, this cannot be considered as a reasonable restriction.”

The IBF petition adds, “the Broadcasters, content production companies, operators and their linked service providers together employ more than 10 lakh people in the sector. TRAI’s impugned provisions that virtually control everything from fixing of a ceiling price of a channel for inclusion in a bouquet and prescribing twin condition will negatively impact the financial viability of the business.”

However, senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond, appearing for TRAI, told the court that the broadcasters are only required to submit their revised tariff structure on January 15. He said, “The financial effect of the regulations will come only on March 1, 2020, he said.

The Bench refused to grant any relief and directed TRAI to file an affidavit by January 20. The matter will now be heard on January 22.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-refuses-to-grant-ad-interim-relief-to-broadcasters/article30570525.ece
40,2020/01/15,"‘BJP-led govt. focused on bullet train, not rural roads’","Maharashtra’s Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif on Tuesday claimed that the previous State government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) focused only on Metros and bullet train projects for cities and neglected rural connectivity and roads. He said the funds allotted for his department may even lapse.

Mr. Mushrif said, “I have been reviewing the department’s performance in the last five years. The priorities of the previous government were Metro projects and bullet trains in urban areas. But in doing so, the roads in the rural parts of the State were neglected. The roads are not in a good condition. There are problems of connectivity in different areas.”

The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader said the funds allocated for the department are now in danger of remaining unused. “There is a possibility that the funds may not be used in their entirety. We are in discussion with the Planning Department. It is true that the money has to be used completely for the allotted purpose of construction of roads in rural areas,” he said.

NCP leader and Lok Sabha MP Supriya Sule had raised the issue of potholed roads in Maharashtra. She also ran a campaign of clicking selfies with potholes and sending them to the ministers in the previous government.

The State has a rural road network of over two lakh kilometres that falls under the Rural Development Department. It is said to be one of the key departments sought by the NCP to ensure it regains its lost base in rural Maharashtra. The department runs the Maharashtra State Rural Livelihood Mission in 34 districts and 351 tehsils. Under it, over 4.23 lakh women self-help groups have been established, connecting over 45 lakh families. The mission has made available ₹6,600 crore in bank loans to groups and enabled 10.83 lakh families in earning a livelihood.

To exhibit products made by such groups, the department will conduct Mahalaxmi Saras Exhibition 2020 from January 17 to 29 at the MMRDA ground in BKC.

42,2020/01/15,"NCP, BJP gear up for civic polls in Pune","With polls to the cash-rich Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies slated for 2022, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are already in combat mode.

In contrast, the Congress, with its rickety organisational structure, and the Shiv Sena, with its crumbling base, are yet to get their act together in Pune. On Tuesday, State Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat convened a meeting of all district presidents of the party in Mumbai to chart out a strategy for the polls. A section of the party leadership in Pune is calling for the appointment of a senior leader to oversee rebuilding of its base in Pune and western Maharashtra.

“With the Pune Cantonment polls due in a couple of months, the appointment of an observer, exclusively devoted to galvanising the party cadre in Pune district, will help prepare the Congress for the civic polls. The booth being a vital point of focus, the observer should ideally be a leader with ‘micro-level’ experience who can revitalise the Congress in the city. This will help revive the party’s connect between voters at the grassroots level,” said Pune City Congress general secretary Ramesh Iyer.

Mr. Iyer said in the Assembly polls, the party had a lead of over 2,000 votes in Khadki and Pune Cantonment, which helped rebuild the party’s base in subsequent local body polls. Sources said a leader with organisational experience like Nitin Raut or Vishwajeet Kadam would be preferable, given that the latter is now a Minister of State and has a base in Pune.

Political analysts say given the bickering over portfolio allocation between the Sena, the NCP and the Congress, it is unlikely that there would be a smooth seat sharing process between the three parties. The BJP and the Sena, despite being in an alliance in the State, contested the 2017 civic polls separately. While the Congress and the NCP had patched up at the eleventh hour, they held ‘friendly contests’ on a number of seats — an indicator of the mutual distrust.

Contrasting fortunes

According to a senior Congress leader, the party’s strength in Pune has been steadily deteriorating since the political twilight of Suresh Kalmadi in 2007. In contrast, the NCP’s influence has increased at the State and the civic body levels, with the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) being transformed into a virtual fiefdom of senior NCP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.

However, the BJP’s ascendancy in the State since 2014 and the party’s expansion in western Maharashtra has shaken the NCP’s hold over Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies. In 2017, the BJP inflicted a crushing defeat on the NCP, winning both civic bodies and breaking the stranglehold of the party.

Now, the NCP is back in power at the State level. Besides securing plum portfolios, Mr. Pawar has returned as Pune’s Guardian Minister, giving the NCP a strategic edge over the Congress in the district. The party also has two MLAs in Pune city: Chetan Tupe (Hadapsar) and Sunil Tingre (Vadgaon Sheri). The NCP now has more resources to expend on civic and development works and expand their power base.

Senior political analyst Rajendra Pandharpure said, “Mr. Pawar is determined to reclaim the PCMC. Since his appointment as Pune’s Guardian Minister, he has started giving projects like the Pune Metro a push and taken measures to expedite development works. The defeat of his son, Parth Pawar from Maval, still rankles him. So, he is naturally determined to reverse his losses.”

Mr. Pandharpure said in contrast, the Congress had lost the Pune seat to the BJP. “The NCP had left the Pune Lok Sabha seat for the Congress. But its candidate Mohan Joshi was routed by the BJP’s Girish Bapat. So, it is unlikely that the NCP will be too accommodating to their ally during the seat sharing for the civic polls,” he said.

The Sena is in dire straits as the party was not given a single seat in the Assembly elections by its then ally, the BJP. With no MLAs in Pune, the Sena’s base has whittled down over the years.

Mr. Pandharpure, “Given that the State government is still unstable, corporators face uncertainty about their future. The next 18 months will see a flurry of activity at the local level. In all likelihood, we might just see a straight contest between the BJP, which controls the Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad bodies, and the NCP, which is hoping to wrest them from the saffron party.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qn3xee/article30570477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMAJITPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ncp-bjp-gear-up-for-civic-polls-in-pune/article30570478.ece
43,2020/01/15,Shivaji’s descendant Udayanraje Bhosale tears into MVA,"Attacking the Shiv Sena on Tuesday, Udayanraje Bhonsale, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and descendant of Maratha king Shivaji, said no political leader is tall enough to merit comparison with the ‘Chhatrapati’. Mr. Bhosale questioned why the photo of the Sena founder, Bal Thackeray, was placed above that of the Maratha king at Sena Bhavan, the party’s headquarters, in Dadar.

Addressing reporters in Pune, Mr. Bhosale, who had remained silent over the row triggered by the publication of a booklet, Aaj ke Shivaji: Narendra Modi, by a BJP leader Jai Bhagwan Goyal, targeted his party for coming out with a book that dared to compare the Prime Minister to king Shivaji.

“Shivaji Maharaj is a universal inspiration… no one is tall enough to be compared to him. Have some people taken leave of their senses by comparing him to the Prime Minister?” said Mr. Bhosale, the 13th direct descendant of the Maratha king.

Harsh criticism

He, however, reserved his sharpest criticism for the Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress, who formed the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in the State. “Just take a look at Sena Bhavan... look at whose image [Bal Thackeray’s] is placed above and whose photo is placed below [of Shivaji],” Mr. Bhosale said, showing photos of Sena Bhavan.

He said the Sena, which claims to be a party built on Shivaji’s ideals, should change its name to Thackeray Sena. “Remove Shiv from Shiv Sena and let me see how many youths flock to your standards. This is the party which had orchestrated riots on king Shivaji’s name,” said Mr. Bhosale, a former three-term NCP MP who had defected to the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls last year.

Mr. Bhosale’s remarks were a riposte to Sena leader Sanjay Raut’s jibes at him. Mr. Raut had demanded that the descendants of Shivaji, including BJP MLA Shivendraraje Bhosale and BJP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sambhaji Raje, speak up against their party on the booklet row. “When you [the Sena leadership] christened your party ‘Shiv Sena’, did you people bother to ask Shivaji’s descendants about it?” Mr. Bhosale said.

Lashing out at the opportunistic nature of the government and Mr. Raut’s role in forging the alliance, Mr. Bhosale said the BJP did not “run after power like dogs”.

In a veiled jibe at NCP chief Sharad Pawar, he said using king Shivaji’s epithet, Jaanta Raja (the wise king), for someone is equal to belittling the Maratha ruler. He said only the 17th century king had claim to the title. The moniker has often been used to refer to Mr. Pawar in political circles. BJP leaders, including former minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, latched on this reference to defend the booklet and criticise the Sena’s double standards.

The booklet evoked condemnation across the State, with a number of protests and demonstrations involving the burning of effigies being held by the Sena, the NCP and the Congress. Activists of the ruling parties also filed multiple police complaints against Mr. Goyal in several districts.

Mr. Bhosale, who was one of only four elected NCP MPs in Maharashtra in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, had resigned to switch to the BJP. However, in the Satara Lok Sabha by-election, he lost to senior NCP leader and former Sikkim Governor Shriniwas Patil.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xje0q4/article30570468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMUDAYANRAJEBHOSALEPRESSSCONFERENCEPUNE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/shivajis-descendant-udayanraje-bhosale-tears-into-mva/article30570469.ece

45,2020/01/15,"Another century, another list – the intelligent fan’s guide","In the last century, cricket writer A A Thomson gave this advice to a friend who asked which ten books he should start a cricket collection with: “Any eight by Cardus.” What about this century? I shall borrow from Thomson and start by saying, “Anything by Gideon Haigh…”

Three personal favourites are Stroke of Genius: Victor Trumper and the Shot That Changed Cricket, about a player, a single stroke, a history of the game and what it means to people, identity and more. Mystery Spinner is the story of Jack Iverson while Silent Revolutions is a delightful collection of Haigh’s journalism. Haigh’s secret has been known for some time. He brings to his journalistic pieces the same discipline, controlled intensity and authority that he displays in his books.

For the remaining titles, I have divided the books into five broad categories: Concerning India, biographies and autobiographies, history, issues of the game and anthologies.

Ramachandra Guha’s A Corner of a Foreign Field brought Indian cricket writing into the 21st century, weaving together many threads — historical, biographical, personal, political, cultural, philosophical — in a vibrant, original pattern. Prashanth Kidambi’s recent Cricket Country, the well-researched story of an Indian team’s first tour of England in 1911 sits comfortably alongside it, another fine example of a scholar turning his attention to cricket.

Pundits From Pakistan, written a decade and a half ago on the Indian team’s tour of Pakistan remains fresh and reaffirms that its author, Rahul Bhattacharya is one of the finest cricket writers anywhere.

Among efforts by players, there is Aakash Chopra’s debut Beyond The Blues and its companion, Out of the Blue. The diary of a season, and then the story of Rajasthan’s maiden Ranji Trophy triumph are narrated with an empathy few players bring to their writing.

The final choice is James Astill’s The Great Tamasha, a story of Indian cricket with all its chaos and mismanagement. “There’s great passion for cricket in this country,” the late Tiger Pataudi told Astill, “but little knowledge.”

Opening up

Knowledge comes through in Michael Atherton’s Opening Up, by a sportsman with the rare quality of self-awareness. Perhaps there is something about opening batsmen — Chopra was one — for my next choice is Marcus Trescothick’s moving, candid story of his depression in Coming Back to Me, which brought mental issues out in the open.

When Jack Fingleton first met Don Bradman, the latter corrected his pronunciation. The relationship never improved. The story is told in George Growden’s The Man Who Stood Up to Bradman. The famous Bill Woodfull quote in the dressing room during Bodyline (“there are two teams out there; one is trying to play cricket, the other is not”) was leaked to the press. Fingleton was responsible, according to Bradman. No, it was Bradman himself who leaked it, Fingleton always insisted and provided the clues.

Cricket: The Game of Life by Scyld Berry, ex-editor of Wisden and the doyen of journalists is a paean to the game by someone close to it in every sense.

The history of Pakistan cricket, The Unquiet Ones by Osman Samiuddin is an account by an insider who had the advantage of distance, while The Fire Burns Blue, the story of women’s cricket in India is a lovingly constructed history by Karunya Keshav and the late Sidhanta Patnaik. Bodyline Autopsy by David Frith might well be the final word on the subject, it is that comprehensive.

A study of cricket suicides

Frith also wrote Silence of The Heart, a study of cricket suicides. It tries to answer the question: Are cricketers at greater risk of suicide, and if so why? The conclusion may not be scientific, but the research and the narration — two Frith specialties — are impressive. Mike Brearley, who wrote the foreword to that book, examines with his usual combination of authority and profundity the question of form in cricket in On Form. There is width as well as depth here.

Malcolm Knox’s Never a Gentleman’s Game is a reminder that the game has seldom been pure. Most of the maladies afflicting the game today have a long history, and this book is recommended to those who think match-fixing began at the turn of the century. To be read with Simon Rae’s story of “skullduggery, sharp practice and downright cheating in the noble game”, It’s Not Cricket.

The century’s most original book analyses its most original format, the T20. Cricket 2.0 by Tim Wigmore and Freddie Wilde takes us where cover drives and vicious pulls are not as important as the data they give rise to. The IPL is no longer “cricketainment” but a business venture where the computer is king and the number-cruncher is coach. A fascinating look at a format we are still coming to grips with.

Finally, the anthologies. Frith, Atherton, Richie Benaud, Brearley have all had their journalism put together in books. Picador Book of Cricket by Ramachandra Guha stands out here. The Meaning of Cricket by Jon Hotten is a delight. The subtitle — How to Waste Your Life on on Inconsequential Sport — says it all.",columns,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/ogt3ws/article30569033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14BOOKS,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/another-century-another-list-the-intelligent-fans-guide/article30569034.ece

49,2020/01/15,Recreate alliance against ISIS: Javad Zarif,"The fight against the Islamic State suffered a setback with the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani, said the Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif on Wednesday. Addressing the annual Raisina Dialogue, the visiting minister said the Islamic State's fighters are located near India and Iran and both countries should recreate the anti-ISIS alliance.

""General Soleimani was the single most important challenger to Daesh. The fight against Daesh suffered a big setback with his assassination. There are two persons who are celebrating the assassination of General Soleimani, - President Trump and Daesh (Islamic State),"" said Mr. Zarif highlighting that the death of General Soleimani has affected the front against the ISIS. The late general was a leading figure in the anti-ISIS fight that led to the defeat of the group in Syria and Iraq where they had initially gained territorial advantage in 2011-14.

Also read: Analysis | The importance of Qasem Soleimani

General Soleimani was assassinated in Baghdad during a visit there, by missiles fired from a U.S. drone on January 3. The action triggered a chain of events that ultimately led to the Iranians firing missiles at the US bases in Iraq that were involved in the assassination. The minister pointed out that the US broke international law by targeting an Iranian general who was visiting Iraq. He justified Iranian actions as measures taken in self defence.

The Iranian diplomat alerted India about the threat posed by ISIS or Daesh and urged Delhi and Tehran should strengthen the fight against the group.

""Daesh is in fact very close to you and us. They are in Afghanistan where they are holding the same territories from which the Taliban started,"" said Javad Zarif warning about the perils that ISIS poses to India and other countries in the region. He was not open to letting the U.S. participate in such a grouping unconditionally and said, ""U.S. should prove that it is interested in fighting Daesh.""

The Iranian minister criticised the U.S. but also indicated that Tehran remains open to dialogue with the U.S.. ""We have an official channel through the Swiss for diplomacy with the U.S.,"" said Mr. Zarif shedding light on the secret channel through which the two powers maintain contact and resolved high tension in the aftermath of the assassination of General Soleimani. The minister said that the late general was popular across the world and a large number of rallies and meetings took place for him in Iraq, Iran, Lebanon and even in India. He claimed that 430 meetings took place in memory of General Soleimani in India.

He also shed light on the downing of the Ukrainian airliner near Tehran which took place at the height of US-Iran hostilities following the killing of the general. ""Why did it happen? It happened because there was a crisis? It happened at the time of a crisis,"" said Mr. Zarif indicating that the downing of the airliner was a mistake committed by Iranian forces that were engaged in a high tension hostility with the U.S. at the time of this incident.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/suys5d/article30572703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-FM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/recreate-alliance-against-isis-javad-zarif/article30572738.ece

51,2020/01/15,Guatemala swears in conservative Giammattei as president,"Guatemala swore in Alejandro Giammattei, a conservative physician opposed to gay marriage and abortion, as its new president on Tuesday while the country’s outgoing leader exited amid swirling corruption accusations.

The ceremony came after a five-hour delay and boisterous protests against ex-President Jimmy Morales.

The 63-year-old Giammattei won the presidency on his fourth attempt in August for Vamos, a party founded in 2017 by politicians, businessmen and military officers on promises of battling poverty and providing better opportunities.

He promised to propose legislation declaring the country’s street gangs as terrorist groups. He also pledged to promote the rule of law, protect investments and spur employment.

Giammattei was sworn in before several Latin American leaders, among them Juan Orlando Hernandez of Honduras, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, Ivan Duque of Colombia and Lenin Moreno of Ecuador.

U.S. Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met privately with Giammattei before the inauguration.

The U.S. Embassy announced via Twitter that the two countries would sign a memorandum of understanding Wednesday on $1 billion in investment in the private sector to stimulate job creation in Guatemala.

One of the early challenges facing Giammattei will be an Asylum Cooperation Agreement signed by his predecessor with the United States government. There was significant opposition to the deal inside Guatemala.

The U.S. began sending Honduran and Salvadoran asylum seekers to Guatemala under the agreement in November and recently said it would expand it to Mexicans. A similar deal signed with Honduras could send Guatemalan asylum seekers there.

Giammattei inherits a country in which 59% of Guatemalans live below the poverty line, according to official figures, while nearly one million children below age five are estimated to live with chronic malnutrition.

He has proposed to build what he calls a “Mayan Train”, high-speed rail with a line for cargo and another for passengers. The name mirrors a planned train project for neighbouring Mexico that will travel between coastal resorts, cities and Mayan ruins in that country’s southeast.

Giammattei will be working without a majority in Congress. His party captured 17 seats.

The surgeon suffers from multiple sclerosis, a disease of the nervous system, and uses crutches to walk. He has also worked as a business consultant in the private sector.

In 2006, Giammattei was the head of the country’s prison system when the interior ministry carried out a raid on the Pavon penal farm to regain control from the inmates. Thousands of police, soldiers and armed civilians raided the prison overnight and several inmates died in the operation.

Authorities, bureaucrats and private citizens were arrested, tried and imprisoned for the raid, including Giammattei. After several months in jail awaiting trial he was acquitted and released.

He takes over from Morales who spent much of his four-year term dodging corruption charges.

The former television comedian who campaigned on a promise of “not corrupt, not a thief” will possibly be most remembered for kicking out a UN supported anti-corruption mission that was closing in on him and members of his family.

Hours before the inauguration, Morales said he had left the country “stable” and blamed his detractors for attacking him.

Juan Francisco Sandoval, head of the special prosecutor against impunity office, said he hopes the future will be better without Morales. “He was the roadblock for the fight against corruption and impunity,” Sandoval said.

In a farewell speech heavy on nationalist and religious themes, Alvaro Arzu, the outgoing president of Congress, said Morales had “defended the sovereignty of Guatemala”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vpnkua/article30572531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GIAMMATTEI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/guatemala-swears-in-conservative-giammattei-as-president/article30572532.ece
52,2020/01/15,"Lebanon in ‘week of wrath’ protests over political, economic crisis","Lebanese demonstrators have taken to the streets to demand an end to a months-long political vacuum, with police firing tear gas at the start of what protesters have billed a “week of wrath“.

Protesters resumed blocking major highways on Tuesday before anti-riot police armed with batons and shields charged hundreds of demonstrators outside the Lebanese central bank.

The charge dispersed the crowd, some of whom smashed paving stones to hurl them at police while others distributed onions to ward off the effects of the tear gas.

The civil defence said it had treated civilians and members of the police for light injuries at the scene, without saying how many, while others who had been wounded were taken to hospital.

On Twitter, the security forces denounced “attacks” led by “rioters” who had thrown stones and firecrackers at police.

Although protests had declined in size in recent weeks, demonstrations have been ongoing since mid-October, increasingly targeting banks and state institutions blamed for driving Lebanon towards collapse.

The unprecedented cross-sectarian movement has been fuelled by a crippling economic crisis, the worst since Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war.

Debt-burdened Lebanon has been without a government after Saad Hariri resigned as prime minister on October 29, as political parties fail to agree on the makeup of a new team.

“Rebel, Beirut,” dozens of protesters chanted as they marched to the sound of drums towards the home of premier designate Hassan Diab, who has struggled to form a cabinet since he was named on December 19.

“I want a government that can resolve the economic crisis as quickly as possible,” said Nour, a 31-year-old marcher.

As a liquidity crisis grows and the cost of living rises, protesters have returned to the streets to urge politicians to swiftly form a cabinet of experts to respond to their demands.

On Tuesday morning, dozens of protesters blocked key highways in and around Beirut with overturned rubbish bins and burning tyres.

Laila Youssef, 47, said she was taking part to call on politicians to wake up.

“We’ve gone back to closing down roads because we can’t stand it anymore,” the mother of three said. “What we earn today is not enough to buy the basics for home.”

Many Lebanese have lost their jobs or seen their salaries reduced by half in recent months.

Even as banks cap withdrawals, the value of the Lebanese pound to the U.S. dollar has fallen by almost half on the parallel exchange market.

In a televised speech, President Michel Aoun acknowledged the delay in agreeing a new cabinet line-up but appealed for more time to find suitable candidates.

“What is needed is a government... to address the pressing economic and financial crisis,” he told foreign envoys.

“The formation of this government demands choosing competent individuals who deserve the trust of the people and parliament, which takes time,” he said.

“We want a government as soon as possible because the economic situation can no longer wait and the country is sliding towards collapse,” he said.

The protests had dwindled to symbolic gatherings in recent weeks after Diab, a professor and former education minister, was nominated last month.

But Lebanese have returned to the streets since Saturday, when hundreds gathered across the country to vent their frustration.

The protesters are demanding a new government made up solely of independent technocrats, but analysts warn this may be a tall order in a country ruled by a sectarian power-sharing system since the end of the civil war.

The World Bank has warned of a recession that may see the proportion of people living in poverty climb from a third to half the population.

Even before the protests began, economic growth in Lebanon had slowed sharply in the face of repeated political deadlocks in recent years, compounded by the war in neighbouring Syria.

54,2020/01/15,"China, Pakistan naval exercise concludes","China and Pakistan on January 14 concluded a nine-day mega naval exercise during which they carried out advance-level joint drills and naval maneuvers in the North Arabian Sea.

The sixth ‘Sea Guardians’ exercise took place in the midst of heightened tension between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir issue. Key platforms of both China and Pakistan, including submarines, destroyers and frigates, were part of the exercise.

Deputy Commander of Southern Theatre Command People’s Liberation Army (Navy), Vice Admiral Dong Jun was chief guest at the closing ceremony at the Karachi Naval Dockyard. Commander of Pakistan Fleet, Vice Admiral Asif Khaliq was also present, Pakistan Navy said in a statement.

During the exercise, Pakistan Navy and PLA (Navy) Flotilla comprising naval platforms and assets along with Marines Corps Detachments carried out advance level joint drills and naval maneuvers in North Arabian Sea.

The harbour and sea activities of the exercise were also witnessed by senior officials from both the navies.

Exercise Sea Guardians-2020 was designed to share professional experiences on contemporary and non-traditional threats as well as to enhance bilateral cooperation and interoperability between the two navies.

Addressing the ceremony, Vice Admiral Khaliq expressed satisfaction over the “mutually benefiting and professionally rewarding conduct of the exercise“.

Deputy Commander of Southern Theatre Command PLA, Vice Admiral Dong hoped that the exercise will further enhance bilateral relationships and cooperation in general and navies in particular.

India had deployed its aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya in the Arabian Sea at the time China and Pakistan were holding the nine-day mega naval exercise in the region.

China has been expanding its presence in the North Arabian Sea and is developing Pakistan’s deep water Gwadar port in the region.

Gwadar is being connected through the over $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to China’s Xinjiang province, providing a key land route to China to access the Arabian Sea.

55,2020/01/15,Iraq's Sadr calls for anti-US protests amid new rocket attack,"Firebrand Iraqi leader Moqtada Sadr called on Tuesday for a peaceful “million-strong march” against US troops in Iraq, days after parliament urged their departure following Washington's killing of an Iranian general in a drone strike.

Further upping the pressure on the American deployment, Katyusha rockets on Tuesday night targeted an Iraqi airbase north of Baghdad where US-led coalition forces are based, in the latest attack on American forces in the country.

“The skies, land and sovereignty of Iraq are being violated every day by occupying forces,” Mr. Sadr, a populist Shia politician and cleric, wrote on Twitter.

He urged Iraqis to hold “a million-strong, peaceful, unified demonstration to condemn the American presence and its violations”, without giving a date.

Washington on January 3 killed Iran's revered Quds Force chief Qasem Soleimani in a Baghdad drone strike that also killed a senior Iraqi military official.

The Iraqi parliament responded by voting on January 5 to oust foreign forces — including some 5,200 American troops — who have backed the fight against Islamic State jihadists since 2014.

Bases where US forces are stationed have been under a steady stream of rocket attacks for several months that have killed one American contractor and one Iraqi soldier.

On Tuesday, a new rocket attack targeted the Camp Taji airbase north of Baghdad, the Iraqi military said, without specifying how many rockets hit the base.

Police and medical sources told AFP two Iraqi personnel members were wounded in the attack.

The military instability comes months into mass anti-government demonstrations in Baghdad and the country's south, condemning politicians seen as corrupt and inept.

The rallies have persisted throughout but shifted to include calls for Iraq to be spared any conflict between Iran and the US.

Iraq has been in political paralysis since the resignation late last year of prime minister Adel Abdel Mahdi, with pro- and anti-Iran factions unable to agree on a candidate to form a new government.

Protesters have rejected the possibility of reinstating Abdel Mahdi.

“The people reject that,” said Hussin Ali Abdul Hussein, a demonstrator in Karbala, south of the capital. ""We don't want to recycle the rubbish, we want a prime minister the public can accept.""

The protest movement and the ensuing crackdown by security forces has left around 460 people dead, mostly protesters.

Activists have faced a campaign of intimidation, abductions and killings.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3nlk8a/article30570231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CampTaji,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rockets-target-iraq-airbase-hosting-us-forces-military/article30570232.ece
56,2020/01/15,"Severe weather kills 130 in Pakistan, Afghanistan","Avalanches, flooding and harsh winter weather has killed more than 130 people across Pakistan and Afghanistan in recent days, officials said on Tuesday, as authorities struggled to reach people stranded by heavy snowfall.

At least 93 people died and 76 were injured across Pakistan — with several still missing — while a further 39 were killed in Afghanistan, according to officials.

Forecasts suggest more harsh weather is to come.

Pakistan-occupied Kashmir was the worst-hit area, with 62 people killed and 10 others missing, the State Disaster Management Authority said in a statement.

In the picturesque but conflict-riven Neelum Valley in PoK, heavy snowfall triggered several avalanches, including one that killed at least 19 people.

“An avalanche hit their village, 10 people are still missing,” the SDMA said.

Frequent avalanches and landslides occur in PoK during the winter, often blocking roads and leaving communities isolated.

Authorities have shuttered schools, while several highways and roads were closed across the country’s northern mountainous areas, according to officials.

To the southeast, in Balochistan province, at least 31 people were killed in separate weather-related incidents.

“Most of those who died were women and children,” said Mohammad Younus, an official with the provincial disaster management authority, adding that hundreds remained stranded.

Across the border in Afghanistan, over 300 houses were either destroyed or partially damaged throughout the country, said Ahmad Tamim Azimi, a spokesman for the Natural Disaster Management Authority.

“A cold snap, heavy snowfall and rains that started two weeks ago have caused damage,” he said, adding that most casualties were caused after roofs collapsed under thick snow.

Hardest hit were southern Kandahar, Helmand, Zabul and western Herat provinces.

In Herat, seven people — all members of the same family and including children — died when their roof caved in, Azimi added.

Harsh winters often take a heavy toll in mountainous Afghanistan, and the country remains poor despite billions of dollars in aid.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yc7srq/article30569391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-snow,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/severe-weather-kills-130-in-pakistan-afghanistan/article30569392.ece

60,2020/01/15,The abode of small things,"Teeny Weeny Museum on the Jagathy-Edapazhanji road houses miniatures, but runs high on ambition.

The museum, the brainchild of Sunil Ananthapadmanabhan, covers a wide spectrum, from the city’s very own affairs to the International Space Station.

Sunil was passionate about miniatures right from his childhood, and while recuperating from a stroke in February last, decided to take forward his dream of setting up a museum.

He had built up a substantial collection already and visited other museums, including one in Pune, to get an idea of how things are run.

After eight months and a huge dent on his savings, the Teeny Weeny Museum was inaugurated in a renovated house by Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran a couple of months ago. Sunil is assisted in the venture by Padmakumar K.G., and three artists. At a museum above the workshop the artists handcraft miniatures. The rest are sourced online or offline.

Art with bamboo

The first segment of the museum sports bamboo miniatures, with scaled models of the Charminar, Gateway of India, India Gate, Eiffel Tower, Leaning Tower of Pisa, and houseboats, and contemporary houses, some of them incorporating the ‘naalekettu’ and ‘ettukettu.’ The bamboo miniatures are not very tiny, a deliberate decision so that visitors can appreciate the finer nuances without going too near, he says.

Space segment

Up next is the space segment. While a miniature handcrafted model of the International Space Station and a space shuttle are suspended from the ceiling, down below, there are models of Apollo 11 and Vostok 1, moon landing with the Rover, the vehicle assembly building at Sriharikota, the Sputnik, all arranged to the likeness of Kennedy Space Center, complete with roads and lawns. Sunil is currently fabricating a launchpad for rockets.

Local flavour

An exclusive segment provides the local flavour – tiny models of Central railway station here, complete with the facade, reservation counter, the Ponnara Sreedhara park in front, tracks, signals, overbridges, and even announcements. Three types of miniature engines (WDM, LHB, and turbo-charged) fabricated in Sunil’s workshop add to the authenticity. The segment will soon incorporate a track changing system.

Attention to detail stands out. Be it the benches and water kiosks on the platforms and the ATM near the station entrance or the ‘Pioneer’ transporter that conveys the materials to the ISS, everything seems designed to a T.

There are segments on the international airport and the Kowdiar area too, apart from one dedicated to individual miniatures.

There is a fee for entry to the museum.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/nxj83z/article30570400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tvtvmini,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/the-abode-of-small-things/article30570401.ece
61,2020/01/15,Transgenders air their woes at adalat,"Beyond the malice society throws at them, what pains transgenders the most is the attitude their families harbour towards them. Often, they have to flee from their homes to be able to even accept themselves as they are.

“People think it is a problem with us. They don’t understand our orientation was decided when we were in our mother’s womb. We do not even get to call those who gave birth to us ‘mother,’” says Karthika S., office assistant in the State government’s Transgender Cell.

Karthika says it is essential that families of transgender persons are given counselling. Societal awareness too is needed.

Their struggles do not end even after fleeing from home. Jobs, shelter, identity...all remain a challenge. These and many such issues were highlighted by Karthika and other transgender persons who attended the first State-level transgender adalat organised by the Kerala State Youth Commission here on Tuesday. Fifty-six complaints were received at the adalat.

Laya, earlier project assistant in the Transgender Cell, says many transgender persons have good educational qualifications while many pursue equivalency courses. However, they need jobs to improve their lives. At present, vacancies in government departments or agencies are only on contract. If reservation is given to them through the PSC, they can be assured of lifelong security and dignity.

‘Transgender category’

Nadira Mehrin, an MA Political Science student at University College, seconds Laya. She also points out that transgender students have no option but to compete in male or female categories in arts or sports events in universities. “We want a transgender category.”

Though they have Aadhaar cards and transgender cards issued by the Social Justice Department, their voter cards with the term ‘third gender’ on them remain a symbol of the discrimination they face.

Though the government has a reimbursement scheme for sex reassignment surgeries, many transgender persons are unable to pay for them initially, she says. “If hospitals are empanelled by the government, it can help avoid the huge strain of raising funds in the first place.” Nadira also calls for SRS facilities, right from counselling to post-operative care, to be made available at government hospitals in the State.

Abuse and violence against transgender persons is another issue that was brought up. They face a lot of jibes owing to their identity if they do land a job. Even using public transport is difficult. Nadira mentions the tardy progress in the murder case of Shalu, a transgender, though it has been months since the incident. They also raised the demand for starting care homes for community members in each district.

Commission chairperson Chintha Jerome said the recommendations would be looked into and brought to the notice of government departments for action. Reports were sought into individual complaints of violence given by the transgender persons. Commission member V. Vinil, secretary T.K. Jayashree, and assistant Manoj C.D. were also present.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/transgenders-air-their-woes-at-adalat/article30570376.ece

65,2020/01/15,North Andhra forum calls for consensus on three capitals plan,"Welcoming the proposal of setting up the Executive capital at Visakhapatnam, Forum for Development of North Andhra has said that it is time all should reach a consensus on the crucial issue. At a meeting here on Tuesday, the members of the forum led by chairman K.V. Ramana passed a resolution to this effect.

After Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy mooted the plan of setting up three capitals in the State, there have been demands from various regions to locate capital in the respective areas. Even as the government is claiming decentralisation of development as the key goal of the move, farmers in Amaravati have taken to the streets against the shifting of the existing capital.

“The forum is of the view that the Chief Minister, the Cabinet and the government officials should function from one place to ensure efficient administration. Separating them in the name of decentralisation is not correct,” said Mr. forum general secretary A. Aja Sarma.

He said that apart from making Vizag the Executive capital, the government should focus on creating employment and improve agriculture, complete Uttrandhra Sujala Sravnthi and other pending projects.

“The jute, sugar factories and other industries that have been closed should be revived. Jetties should be built for fishermen, apart from setting up another fishing harbour at Bhavanapadu. The government should set up industries in the tribal areas within the purview of Section 1/70 of Land Transfer (Prevention) Act and it should allot captive mines to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP) to ensure development of North Andhra region,” he said.

67,2020/01/15,Police form special teams to check rooster fights,"In an attempt to check the banned cockfight during Sankranti festival, the city police have deployed special teams comprising personnel of the law and order wing and City Task Force (CTF).

According to sources, the areas on the city outskirt areas such as Pendurthi, Parawada, Arilova, Anandapuram, Padmanabham, Bheemili among others are vulnerable venues for cockfights.

The police authorities say that they have identified suspected places and alerted the special teams.

On January 11, as many as 245 rooster knives were seized after the City Task Force (CTF) teams raided a house in Pendurthi area. A senior police officer says that they are probing into the case to ascertain who have bought knives from the accused.

“Special teams have been deployed in Zone I and II and the personnel will keep a watch on cockfights. The law and order wing is also monitoring the gangs organising betting during the festival,” says Assistant Commissioner of Police (CTF) A. Trinad Rao.

Meanwhile, the Rural Police are on their toes as many interior areas in the sub-urban limits, especially the villages bordering East Godavari district, are vulnerable to organising cockfights.

68,2020/01/15,‘Bhogi mantalu’ kindle Sankranti fervour,"The denizens celebrated the first day of the four-day Sankranti festival by celebrating Bhogi with enthusiasm and religious fervour.

Young and old alike were seen lighting bonfire (Bhogi monatalu) from as early as 4 a.m., braving the chilly weather. Almost every household lit a bonfire. People living in apartments and gated communities lit community bonfires. The city skylines wore a foggy look till late in the day.

Family get-together

“We begin the Sankranti festival by burning the old things in bonfire, symbolising the hope for starting afresh. As the tradition goes, disposal of old things is linked to getting rid of vices and it is seen as a sacrifice ritual made to Lord Rudra,” said Saraswati Devi, a senior citizen.

She celebrated Bhogi with her children and grandchildren who came from the U.S.A.

Though Pongal is known to be a harvest festival, it is considered as the time for homecoming as people make it a point to go to their native places and celebrate the festival with their family members and relatives. Bhogi plays a key role in Sankranti celebrations as it heralds the beginning of the four-day festival.

For children, Bhogi is the most sought after ritual as they spend the previous day collecting firewood and old things for the bonfire.

“Every year, I, along with my friends, visit the nearby forest area at Madhavadhara to collect the fallen twigs, branches and barks. It is all fun as it turns out to be a sort of a picnic in the woods,” said 14-year-old Rajesh from Madhavadhara.

“The smelling of burning wood and crackling of twigs in the fire and children playing around it is the sight that I love to see. Every year, I come home from the U.S.A. to take part in the festival,” said Radhika, a software professional.

Apart from the morning bonfire, rangolis adorned the doorsteps of almost every household.

“Sankranti festival means making colourful rangolis, relishing traditional cuisines, wearing new clothes and most importantly spending time with the family members and friends and visiting the ancestral home,” said Srinivasa Rao, a retired employee of Vizag Steel Plant.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/cni51h/article30570307.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15VZ2BHOGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/bhogi-mantalu-kindle-sankranti-fervour/article30570308.ece

70,2020/01/15,"Congress accuses Modi government of ‘favouring’ Adani group in ₹45,000 crore submarine project","The Congress on Wednesday accused the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government of ""favouring"" the Adani group in the ₹45,000 crore 75-I Submarine project, alleging that it was promoting its ""crony capitalists"".

The principal Opposition party alleged that the government was promoting 'crony capitalists' by violating laid down rules and regulations.

Addressing a press conference, Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala and party spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill charged the government of violating the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) of 2016 as well as over-ruling the recommendations of the 'Empowered Committee' of the Indian Navy that had been set up for the project.

""Is the Modi government favouring Adani Defence JV in the ₹45,000 crore Submarine project? Is the Modi government promoting financial interests of its crony capitalistic friends by violating the DPP 2016 and eligibility conditions contained therein? Is the Modi government overruling the Indian Navy and its 'Empowered Committee' in the matter of ineligibility of Adani Defence JV?""asked Mr Surjewala.

So far, neither the government nor the Adani group has reacted to the Congress allegations that were made at a special press conference.

The Congress claimed that two key parameters set by the DPP were that the shortlisted company to manufacture the six submarines in the deal should be of Credit 'A' rating and the Ministry of Defence should approve the 'Special Purpose Vehicle' (SPV) set up for the project before applying for ""request for expression of interest"".

The Empowered Committee of the Navy, claimed the Congress, shortlisted the public sector unit, Mazagon Docks Shipbuilders Limited, and Larsen and Toubro from the private sector.

But the Congress alleged that the government is all set to violate the Committee's recommendations by allowing the private entity which neither has any experience in submarine manufacturing nor the required credit rating.

""Is zero experience criteria replacing the long technical criteria in the Defence Procurement?""asked Mr Shergill.

Mr. Surjewala said the Congress has raised the red flag in national interest.

""Let the Prime Minister and Defence Minister come forward and answer that 'fairness not foul play', 'nationalism, not crony capitalism' will be the yardsticks for the decision on India's prestigious submarine project,""Mr. Surjewala added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uzre4m/article30573121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAHNDEEP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-accuses-modi-government-of-favouring-adani-group-in-45000-crore-submarine-project/article30573122.ece
71,2020/01/15,"Jaishankar hits out at countries that criticise government, asks them to introspect on their own actions","India’s challenges of “terrorism, separatism and migration” are only a “national variant” of other countries that face similar global challenges, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said, referring to Kashmir, NRC and the protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Defending the government in response to a question posed to him at the MEA’s annual international conference “Raisina Dialogue” about how he deals with criticism in several world capitals, Mr. Jaishankar said those countries criticising India must consider how they themselves have dealt with the same issues.

“Others should answer, how did they respond? We are not the only country dealing with disturbances in our neighbourhood. Europe has seen conflict; the US had 9/11 (terror attacks). How did they respond? It is important to reflect on your own way of handling these issues. On naturalisation (immigration laws), what is the pathway they took?” said Mr. Jaishankar, adding that critics must not “get fixated on the dots and ignore the line” or big picture.

China relations

Mr. Jaishankar’s comments came even as a UN Security Council meet was due to get under way in New York, where China informed that it will raise the issue of Kashmir as a part of informal consultations. China’s decision came after a recent aborted attempt to raise the issue at the UNSC, which had already had one discussion on August 16 last year. In addition, China has overruled objections from other P-5 members like France, which said clearly that the “Kashmir issue must be settled bilaterally”. Also at the Raisina Dialogue, the Foreign Minister of Estonia, which is a non-permanent member of the UNSC also supported India’s stand that Kashmir is a bilateral issue.

In a session that lasted nearly an hour, Mr. Jaishankar parried questions on a range of issues, including India-US ties, which he called “wide-ranging”, the decision to walk out of Asian trade talks for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), “Brand India” and the relationship between India and China, which he called “No.2 and No. 3 in the world economy”.

“There is no doubt that we have to get on together. The challenge is only in the terms of the relationship. If you are No. 2&3 in the world economy and are neighbours, the logic of reaching a stable relationship is undeniable,” he said, adding that ties were a “work in progress”. He also said that the government has not “closed its mind” to joining RCEP, the 16-nation ASEAN led FTA that includes China.

To a question on whether India was more a “talker than a doer” on India’s connectivity and strategic projects in its immediate neighbourhood, Mr. Jaishankar, pointed to 142 connectivity projects worldwide of which 53 have been completed, pointing out specific road, rail and waterways in Nepal and Bangladesh.

‘India’s way’

When asked what “India’s way” in foreign policy is, the External Affairs Minister, who was a career diplomat from 1977-2018, said that India doesn’t wish to be a “disruptionist power, mercantilist or self-centred” but to be rules-based, and a “just and fair power”.

“We are a pluralistic society and a market economy. What has changed, with more influence and greater capacity, is that we express ourselves more decisively,” he concluded.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/catzdm/article30573112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAISHANKARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jaishankar-hits-out-at-countries-that-criticise-government-asks-them-to-introspect-on-their-own-actions/article30573113.ece
72,2020/01/15,"Over 35 Union ministers to visit Jammu, Srinagar from January 18 in outreach initiative","As many as 36 Union ministers will be fanned out to Jammu and Srinagar from January 18 as part of an outreach initiative.

The visits come five months after the Special Status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution was revoked and the State was downgraded and bifurcated into two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh by the Parliament on August 6.

The outreach, a first of its kind in the past five months, is said to be an initiative of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, will involve 51 visits in the Jammu region and eight in Srinagar in Kashmir Valley. The government stopped Opposition leaders from visiting Srinagar last year. At least two Opposition leaders, Sitaram Yechury and Ghulam Nabi Azad had to move Supreme Court to visit the State.

Last week, the Centre arranged the visit of 15 foreign diplomats to Srinagar and Jammu.

The moves comes amid concerns and resentment among several people, particularly in the Jammu region, of losing special status and apprehension of losing land and jobs to outsiders.

The Centre is already working on a proposal to provide protection to domiciles of J&K in government jobs, educational institutions and land rights.

The Union ministers are expected to inform the people of various J&K specific projects under taken by the respective ministries.

Ministers Smriti Irani, Piyush Goyal, Ravi Shankar Prasad, G. Kishan Reddy, Kiren Rijiju, Hardeep Singh Puri, Jitendra Singh and others will be visiting J&K from January 18-23.

Internet situation

Mobile internet for the general public remains suspended in Kashmir Valley since August 5. On Wednesday, broadband internet was restored in hospitals, banks, etc. with the J&K administration planning to open 400 additional e-terminals or internet kiosks for the residents. 844 kiosks already exist.

73,2020/01/15,"West Bengal, Kerala governments want NPR data collection halted","State governments of West Bengal and Kerala have communicated to the Registrar General of India (RGI) that the collection of data for updating the National Population Register (NPR) should be halted citing maintenance of ""public order"".

The two States wrote to the district census commissioner, who forwarded the request to the RGI. The Chief Ministers of both the States have been vociferous in opposing the NPR exercise, which according to Citizenship Rules 2003 is the first step towards the compilation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The government has clarified that there was no proposal to compile NRC as of now.

""We have received the communication from West Bengal and Kerala. Both the States and others also had notified the exercise last year. They have not cancelled it, they have requested to put it on hold,"" a senior Home Ministry official said on Wednesday.

States of West Bengal, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and Union Territories of Ladakh and Puducherry, despite notifying the exercise last year are yet to convey the dates to the RGI to collect NPR data, that is to begin from April 1 along with the Census exercise.

A column on Permanent Account Number (PAN) has been dropped from the final NPR form following responses received from around 30 lakh respondents during the trial stage in August last year, the official said.

21 parameters

The new NPR form will, for the first time, also collect information on ""mother tongue"", the official said.

NPR will seek details on 21 parameters, seeking specific details on ""place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence"" along with other information like Aadhar (optional), voter ID card, mobile phone and driving license numbers. In 2010 and 2015, it collected details on 14 parameters.

The official said that NPR enumerators will not seek any documents or verify the documents provided by the respondent. They will merely note down the details provided by the respondent.

Data for the NPR was first collected in 2010, and updated in 2015. The Modi government has proposed that the next phase of NPR will be conducted along with Census exercise between April to September 2020.

The decennial Census exercise will be conducted in two phases - House Listing and Housing Census from April to September 2020 and Population Enumeration from February 9 to February 28, 2021.

It was learnt that the situation in Kashmir was to be raised at the meeting.

“We are happy that neither the alarmist scenario painted by the representatives of Pakistan nor any of the baseless allegations made repeatedly by representatives of Pakistan in UN fora were found to be credible today,” Mr. Akbaruddin said.

The ambassador said the discussion was viewed as a “distraction” and that “many friends” had pointed out that bilateral mechanisms were available to address issues between India and Pakistan.

Russia called for differences between India and Pakistan to be settled bilaterally. “Russia firmly stands for the normalisation of relations between India and Pakistan,” a Russian diplomat at the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, tweeted.

“We hope that differences will be settled through bilateral efforts based on the 1972 Simla Agreement and the 1999 Lahore Declaration.”

The Hindu has reached out to the French and U.S. missions at the United Nations for their reactions.

Earlier, The Hindu had learned that the matter will be raised by China towards the end of the Council’s meeting under the “Any other matters” segment of the agenda. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi is visiting the United Nations on Wednesday, as per reports.

Sengar challenged the December 20 verdict of a trial court here which had sentenced him to life imprisonment and had imposed an exemplary fine of ₹25 lakh in the case.

The court had convicted Sengar for rape under the Indian Penal Code and the POCSO Act for offence by a public servant committing penetrative sexual assault against a child after holding the victim to be a minor.

The woman was kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.

The trial which started on August 5 last year after it was transferred from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi on the Supreme Court’s directions, was carried on a day-to-day basis.

77,2020/01/15,Calculated bid to exhaust 1984 riot victims’ hopes for justice: SC-appointed panel,"A Supreme Court-constituted committee has said a government that used its clout to ""hush up"" crimes committed by mobs during the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and a Delhi Police which ""miserably failed"" even to help loved ones identify their dead are squarely responsible for the lack of closure and justice felt by victims even after 36 years.

""The whole effort of the police and the administration seemed to have been to hush up the criminal cases concerning the riots,"" the report filed by the committee chaired by former Delhi High Court judge, Justice S.N. Dhingra has said.

On Wednesday, appearing before a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the Centre would comply with the committee's recommendations.

The committee had submitted the report in the apex court several months ago, it however came into the public domain on Wednesday.

The 1984 riots occurred in the aftermath of the assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta informed a Bench led by Chief Justice Sharad A. Bobde that the government accepts the conclusions of the report and would take further legal action.

The Justice Dhingra Committee was entrusted by the apex court in January 2018 to sift through the case records of 186 anti-Sikh riot cases of murder, bodily injuries, arson, rioting, destruction of property, outraging religious feelings, etc. The court’s order was in response to a plea made by a Special Investigation Team, which was probing a total of 199 cases, for their closure due to lack of evidence. The court had decided that the case deserved a second look before any decision to close them was taken.

In his detailed report, Justice Dhingra makes shocking conclusions about how the Delhi Police and the then administration, along with certain judges and magistrates, sabotaged the cases over the years in a calculated bid to exhaust the vixtims’ hopes for justice.

Justice Dhingra said the police employed several tactics to dilute the cases. Criminal cases were registered in such a way to specifically give clean chit to certain accused persons. Hundreds of cases of murders, which had no connection to each other and had occurred in different times and locations, were clubbed together.

In one case, an “omnibus FIR” was filed on 337 separate complaints about incidents which had no connection to each other. Justice Dhingra said the police deliberately made it “humanly impossible” for themselves to investigate complaints. “How can one investigating officer probe 500 cases, trace witnesses, prepare challans and proceed in court against accused persons,” the panel report pointed out.

“The accused persons of these clubbed cases were sent to trial together. Judges and Magistrates before whom these cases came up would not bother to separate the cases or even question the police. The law requires each case has to be tried separately,” Justice Dhingra said in the report.

“If one FIR was registered in respect of one murder cum riot cum arson cum looting in an area, all other incidents of murder, arson, riot and looting of that area were clubbed in the same FIR. In the name of investigation, nothing was done,” the report said.

In most cases, the rioters were outsiders or the victims would have fled to save their lives. Thus, many accused remain unidentified. However, the Committee referred to hundreds of affidavits filed by victims, which are part of the Justice Ranganath Misra Commission, identifying the accused persons.

“Instead of registering FIRs, committee after committee were formed to delay registration of FIRs,” the report said.

Hundreds of bodies were recovered, the report said, but remain unidentified. Police did not preserve forensic evidence, which would have helped bring a sense of closure to families who still do not know what happened to their loved ones three decades ago.

In one such instance, mobs dragged out Sikh passengers out of trains at Nangloi, Kishanganj, Dayabasti, Shahdara and Tuglakabad railway stations and lynched them. Seventy-one bodies were recovered and 29 remain unidentified, the report said.

Had the administration and police been serious in punishing the culprits, Special Task Force teams for investigating the crimes would have been formed in each police station and forensic laboratories, said the report.

The incidents addressed in the 186 cases took place between November 1 and November 3 of 1984. They involved the murder of 426 people, of which 84 bodies still remain unidentified. The cases also cover the destruction of 700 properties.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/gozys8/article30562986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13-KDR-insolvGI26VO8E73jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/calculated-bid-to-exhaust-1984-riot-victims-hopes-for-justice-sc-panel/article30572888.ece

79,2020/01/15,CAA protests: Aligarh Muslim University V-C to lodge FIR against police action,"Facing pressure from students and teachers, Aligarh Muslim University Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor has decided to lodge an FIR against police action on the campus on December 15 night when the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act allegedly turned violent.

In a statement on Tuesday, Prof. Mansoor said the university administration gave permission to the police “only to bring the situation to normalcy and restore public order and clear the main road and they were not supposed to enter any residential hostel”.

He further said that the evidence brought to the knowledge of the university administration suggests that the police personnel might have crossed the mandate by entering the Morrison Court hostel premises.

‘Police not informed’

SP (City), Aligarh, Abhishek said the police had no information in this regard.

The decision has come at a time when a team of the National Human Rights Commission has reached Aligarh on the order of the Allahabad High Court to collect evidence on the clash between the police and students on December 15. The students are boycotting classes and the teachers have come out in support of them.

‘Leaf out of Jamia’

A senior teacher requesting anonymity said it seems that the V-C took a leaf out of the Jamia Millia Islamia V-C’s book. “He is trying to save his skin,” he said.

AMU Students’ Union president Salman Imtiaz said the move was probably aimed at “weakening the efforts of the student community” and build a narrative that gains their sympathy. “Action against the security forces is the demand of the time but our V-C has turned a blind eye to the atrocities done on the students for a month now and is solely responsible for the tragic incident that took place on the night of December 15,” he said.

Mr. Imtiaz added that if the V-C was sincere in his intention he would join the ongoing protest of the students and speak out in public rallies against the NRC and the CAA where the real battle was being fought.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8s4n25/article30546576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12TARIQMANSOOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-protests-aligarh-muslim-university-v-c-to-lodge-fir-against-police-action/article30572653.ece
80,2020/01/15,Raisina Dialogue | Indo-Pacific a divisive concept: Sergey Lavrov,"Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Wednesday slammed the Western idea of a ‘rules based world order’ while questioning the idea behind the concept of ‘Indo-Pacific’, which he said was an attempt to “reconfigure the existing structures.”

“Why do you need to call Asian Pacific as Indo-Pacific? The answer is evident… to exclude China. Terminology should be unifying, not divisive. Neither Shangai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) nor the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) grouping is exclusionary,” Mr. Lavrov said adding that “our Indians friends are smart enough to understand that.” He was speaking at the ongoing Raisina Dialogue jointly organised by the Ministry of External Affairs and Observer Research Foundation. “We should be careful of terminology which looks very benign but is something else. Its an attempt to reconfigure existing structures,” he cautioned.

The concept of Indo-Pacific has gained ground in the last few years and has been a focus area for India too. Mr. Lavrov said the ‘Indo-Pacific’ was attempt to move from an Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) centered consensus building model.

Mr. Bezos is on a three-day India visit starting from Wednesday. He is likely to attend an event here organised by Amazon for MSMEs. He is also likely to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In addition, he is also likely to meet top Indian businessmen and Hindi cinema celebrities in Mumbai.

Mr. Bezos’ India visit comes at a time when the e-commerce player is facing an anti-trust investigation on multiple counts, including deep discounts and exclusive tie-up with preferred sellers, in India. It had faced similar investigations in the EU and the US.

On Monday, in a major setback ahead of his visit, fair market watchdog, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) ordered an enquiry into the operations of both Amazon and Flipkart on multiple counts, including deep discounts and exclusive tie-up with preferred sellers.

Finding merit in the allegations leveled by traders’ body Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, the Commission on Monday asked its Director General (DG) to complete the investigation in 60 days from the receipt of the order.

83,2020/01/15,‘Don’t see him with 1962 lens’,"Former Defence Minister V.K. Krishna Menon was often “seen with the lens of 1962” [war with China], while there was more to him before 1946 and during the 1950s, said senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh here on Tuesday. Menon’s contributions in the drafting of the Constitution before 1946 and his actions during the 1950s were remarkable.

During a public discussion on ‘The Making of Independent India and V.K. Krishna Menon’ organised by The Hindu Centre for Politics and Public Policy at the Music Academy, Mr. Ramesh recalled incidents from Menon’s life since his college days until his death to capture various phases — both personal and political.

In his conversation with former West Bengal Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Mr. Ramesh said it was Menon, who first came up with the idea of ‘Make in India’. When India had options from the United States of America and the United Kingdom from whom it had to purchase fighter aircraft, he wanted the purchase to be from a country that allowed eventual manufacturing of aircraft in India.

“That was how fighter jet MiG-21 came to be manufactured in India,” pointed out Mr. Ramesh, who authored A Chequered Brilliance: The Many Lives of V.K. Krishna Menon. The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) came about during Menon’s tenure.

Though Menon enjoyed proximity with then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and the latter too believed in the former’s judgment, the Council of Ministers did not approve of Menon’s ideas, Mr. Ramesh pointed out.

Even a few years before the war with China, Menon was for a settlement with the neighbouring country, but did not enjoy the support from the Cabinet, opposition and the media. “But, eventually Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had in 2003 put in place a boundary talk mechanism with China,” Mr. Ramesh said.

Recalling an incident in the United Nations, Mr. Gandhi said when the Foreign Minister of Pakistan repeatedly insisted on a plebiscite in Kashmir, a witty Menon had asked whether Pakistan had seen a ballot box recently.

Notwithstanding the criticism that he was a leftist, Mr. Ramesh said he was “not at all a communist” but supported the Communist Party of Great Britain only because it supported full freedom for India. Mr. Ramesh said Menon was against creating Kerala from the then Madras Presidency, arguing with Nehru it would become a “bastion of communists.”

The tune had been played at the annual ceremony every year since 1950.

“The tune has been dropped this year,” a defence ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed on Tuesday. “There is a review of tunes every year. There is an effort to introduce new tunes and an emphasis to add more Indian tunes,” the official added.

The Vande Mataram song was also a favourite of Mahatma Gandhi, the official said, adding that it could find a place this year. “There are few other new tunes as well including some Indian ones this time,” he added.

There are about 30-35 tunes played at the ceremony another defence official said, stating that the sequence of these tunes was reviewed every time, with new ones being added.

A third unnamed official said there had been an increased emphasis in the last few years on replacing western tunes with Indian tunes as also the addition of traditional Indian instruments.

Abide with Me was written in the 19th century by Scottish poet Henry Francis Lyte and composed by William Henry Monk.

Mr. Nadella became one of the first big corporate names to speak on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) while talking to editors in Manhattan on January 13. “I think what is happening is sad…It’s just bad…I would love to see a Bangladeshi immigrant who comes to India and creates the next unicorn in India or become the next CEO of Infosys,” Ben Smith, editor-in-chief of buzzfeednews.com, quoted Mr. Nadella as saying.

“How literate need to be educated! Perfect example. Precise reason for CAA is to grant opportunities to persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan & Afghanistan. How about granting these opportunities to Syrian Muslims instead of Yezidis in USA?” Ms Lekhi said in a tweet. She also posted a copy of Mr. Nadella’s official statement clarifying further on his comments given to BuzzFeed.

Mr. Nadella said that every country will and should define its borders, protect national security and set immigration policy accordingly. “And in democracies, that is something that the people and their governments will debate and define within those bounds,” he added. He said his own views were shaped by “growing up in a multicultural India and my immigrant experience in United States... My hope is for an India where an immigrant can aspire to found a prosperous start-up or lead a multinational corporation benefiting Indian society and the economy at large.”

Historian Ramchandra Guha supported Mr. Nadella’s view. In a tweet he said, “I am glad Satya Nadella has said what he has.

The PM reportedly spoke about ethical marketing practices during a meeting with top pharmaceutical companies earlier this month. “IMA wants to know if the government had details about companies involved in supplying women to doctors why it chose to invite them for a meeting in PMO rather than initiate criminal proceedings,” the IMA statement said.

In November, a study published by Pune-based Support for Advocacy and Training to Health Initiatives revealed that doctors accept incentives from pharmaceutical companies in the form of leisure trips, tablet, silver items, gold jewellery and petrol cards

90,2020/01/15,Low demand for onions from States worries Centre,"The government is worried that over 36,000 tonnes of onion it is importing will rot in the godowns because of low demand from the State governments. The prices of the commodity had hit up to ₹170 a kg in Delhi.

Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the Centre is offering onions to States at ₹55 a kg landed cost and is ready to bear the cost of transporting them. “So far, we have contracted [import of] 36,000 tonnes. Of which, 18,500 tonnes have reached India but the States have taken only 2,000 tonnes that too after much persuasion. We are worried about its disposal because it is a perishable commodity,” Mr. Paswan told reporters.

He said while the government has to worry about the end consumer it also has to take care of the farmers. “We have to hit runs as well as protect the wicket. Now the farmers will accuse us of creating a glut.” He said someone can go to court accusing the government of leaving the onion to rot.

The Union government imported onions from countries like Turkey and Egypt.

As per the government data, retail onion prices average ₹50 per kg in most markets but is being sold at ₹70-80 a kg in Delhi.

Asked why prices are still high despite the imports, Mr. Paswan said, “The imports are to improve the domestic supply and check prices. If the State governments are not ready to take them, what can we do?”

So far Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal governments have taken them. Many States have withdrawn their demand, he said.

91,2020/01/15,"Probe J&K police officer Davinder Singh’s links, Congress tells govt.","Alleging a ‘larger conspiracy’ behind the arrested Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) police officer Davinder Singh, the Congress on Tuesday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to carry out a thorough probe into his links and pointed out that the officer was posted in Pulwama during the deadly terror attack last February.

Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury tweeted to ask ‘who were the real culprits behind last year’s Pulwama attack’ and claimed that the troll regiment of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) would have reacted differently if Davindar Singh’s name had been ‘Davinder Khan.’

Addressing a press conference, Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala said the episode raises several questions.

“Are there any people who are in the echelons of power who are involved with him (Singh). Is there a larger conspiracy? Is he only a pawn or a carrier in the larger conspiracy that is unleashed?”he asked

The Congress leader said it is laughable to believe that the tainted officer would ferry terrorists to Delhi ahead of Republic Day for a mere ₹12 lakh bribe.

“There is a larger conspiracy. At whose instance was Davinder Singh acting and bringing terrorists to Delhi as it is being reported in newspapers,” Mr. Surjewala said.

On Saturday, police arrested Mr. Singh – a serving deputy superintendent of police – at Mir Bazar in Jammu and Kashmir's Kulgam district along with alleged Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists Naveed Baba and Altaf apart from an unidentified lawyer who allegedly worked as an overground worker for terror groups.

“For how long has he been acting as a conduit for J&K terrorists and other terror factories. What was Davinder Singh’s connection to the 2001 Parliament attack? What is Davinder Singh’s connection to the Pulwama attack, where he was posted as DSP, and 42 of our jawans lost their lives,” the Congress leader asked.

Mr. Surjewala said the availability of RDX explosives and the security breach by the suicide bomber raises serious questions.

“What is this conspiracy is what the nation wants to know,” said Mr. Surjewala.

The Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, in a series of tweets, also raised the Pulwama incident.

“Now, question will certainly arise as to who were the real culprits behind the gruesome Pulwama incident, need a fresh look on it,” Mr. Chowdhury said.

“Had Davindar Singh by default been Davindar Khan, the reaction of troll regiment of RSS would have been more strident and vociferous.

92,2020/01/15,"3 Customs officials, 14 others booked for fraud","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked three Mumbai-based Customs officials and 14 others for alleged money laundering through over-invoicing of imported rough diamonds. The gems weighing 5,599.52 carats, with the actual value of just ₹1.03 crore, were declared as worth over ₹156 crore. Among the accused are the then Commissioner (Airport Special Cargo Commissionerate) Vinay Brij Singh and Deputy Commissioners Chandravanshi Y. Manikanhaiya and Ashiquzzaman. The case is based on a probe by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence.

It is alleged that businessman Girish Kadel, who also has business interests in India, had imported diamonds from Switzerland to Hong Kong through his four companies. In mid-2018, he exported some diamonds to India under 14 bills of entry by Antique Exim Private Limited and Tanman Jewels, showing their value as ₹156.28 crore.

In the FIR, the CBI alleges that Mr. Kadel used the import-export codes of the two companies with the help of Atul Paldecha to siphon off the excess foreign exchange overseas on the pretext of diamond imports. This was done allegedly to cover the differential cost of other imports and park the rest of the money abroad.

The over-valuation was done allegedly in connivance with the officials and government-appointed valuers, who have been named in the FIR.

According to the DRI, the then Commissioner had ordered an inquiry into the issue. However, a few days later he instructed Mr. Ashiquzzaman to write new notings, destroyed the notesheet, and changed his earlier directions of further investigation, with a direction that assessment should be done as per the valuation report.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3-customs-officials-14-others-booked-for-fraud/article30569644.ece
93,2020/01/15,"National Policy for Rare Diseases-2020 is ‘just another piece of paper’, say patient groups","Calling it just another piece of paper that is far from reality, groups working in the area of rare diseases in India have said that the National Policy for Rare Diseases-2020, released recently by the Union Health Ministry, is nothing more than “an illusion”. It also offers no clarity on long-term financial assistance, they said.

The government, in its policy paper, has proposed financial support of up to ₹15 lakh under an umbrella scheme of the Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi for those rare diseases that require a one-time treatment. Beneficiaries for such financial assistance would not be limited to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families, but extended to 40% of the population eligible as per the norms of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, for their treatment in government tertiary hospitals only.

‘Alternate funding’

It has also proposed that the Government will “endeavour to create alternate funding mechanism through setting up a digital platform for voluntary individual and corporate donors to contribute to the treatment cost of patients of rare diseases”.

For prevention and control, the Ministry has noted that it will work at encouraging people to seek pre-marital genetic counselling, identification of high risk couples, and create awareness about early detection rare diseases.

“The 2017 policy on rare diseases had proposed a ₹100 crore corpus fund allocation for the treatment of patients with rare diseases, which was a Centre-State partnership of 60:40, with each State forming a technical committee to evaluate patients’ applications. That has come down to ₹15 lakh support for diseases needing one-time treatment. Clearly, now, after a major lag, the policy has come with no hope in sight,” noted a release from the Lysosomal Storage Disorders Support Society.

‘Far from reality’

The society’s president Manjit Singh said, “Policy 2020 is far from reality and lacks genuine interest in providing much-needed treatment to ‘treatable’ Rare Diseases.”

Prasanna Shirol, founder of the Organization for Rare Diseases India (ORDI), said that the policy is a “plain mockery of the situation of patients”, and that proposed solutions such as the creation of a digital platform for crowd funding were not reliable. “How can you design a policy by the government based on donations?

Union Home Minister and current national president of the party, Amit Shah, is scheduled to address a massive rally on the issue in Vaishali in Bihar on Thursday.

Sources in the BJP said the meeting in a State where BJP’s own ally, Chief Minister and Janata Dal (U) leader Nitish Kumar, has declared that the CAA needs to be debated in the Assembly and shut down prospects of any exercise for the National Register of Citizens (NRC) is not only important in itself but also has great symbolism.

96,2020/01/15,Centre eases CRZ rules for ‘Blue Flag’ beaches,"The Environment Ministry has relaxed Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules that restrict construction near beaches to help States construct infrastructure and enable them to receive ‘Blue Flag’ certification.

Last year, the Ministry selected 13 beaches in India to vie for the certificate. This is an international recognition conferred on beaches that meet certain criteria of cleanliness and environmental propriety.

The earmarked beaches are — Ghoghala beach (Diu), Shivrajpur beach (Gujarat), Bhogave beach (Maharashtra), Padubidri and Kasarkod beaches (Karnataka), Kappad beach (Kerala), Kovalam beach (Tamil Nadu), Eden beach (Puducherry), Rushikonda beach (Andhra Pradesh), Miramar beach (Goa), Golden beach (Odisha), Radhanagar beach (Andaman & Nicobar Islands) and Bangaram beach (Lakshadweep).

Gazette notification

The Blue Flag certification, however, requires beaches to create certain infrastructure — portable toilet blocks, grey water treatment plants, a solar power plant, seating facilities, CCTV surveillance and the like. However, India’s CRZ laws don’t allow the construction of such infrastructure on beaches and islands. Via an order on January 9, the Environment Ministry eased these restrictions for the “purposes of Blue Flag certification”.

“...Central Government hereby declares that for the purpose of Blue Flag Certification in such identified beaches, the following activities and facilities shall be permitted in the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), including Islands, subject to maintaining a minimum distance of 10 meters from HTL (High Tide Line),” the gazette notification notes.

The certification is accorded by the Denmark-based Foundation for Environment Education, with 33 stringent criteria under four major heads for the beaches, that is, (i) Environmental Education and Information (ii) Bathing Water Quality (iii) Environment Management and Conservation and (iv) Safety and Services.

‘Eco-tourism’

The ‘Blue Flag’ beach is an ‘eco-tourism model’ and marks out beaches as providing tourists and beachgoers clean and hygienic bathing water, facilities/amenities, a safe and healthy environment, and sustainable development of the area.

The Blue Flag Programme started in France in 1985 and has been implemented in Europe since 1987, and in areas outside Europe since 2001, when South Africa joined.

97,2020/01/15,BSP appoints Ritesh Pandey as party leader in Lok Sabha,"In another flip flop, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati has appointed Ritesh Pandey, the MP from Ambedkar Nagar as the new leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, citing the need to maintain “social harmony”.

Mr. Pandey replaces Amroha MP Kunwar Danish Ali.

M.r Ali, who was appointed the BSP’s leader in the Lok Sabha after 2019 general elections, was replaced soon after in July when he differed from the party line and spoke critically of the stripping of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and the triple talaq Bill. However, he was reinstated in November, after the party’s miserable showing in the Assembly by-polls, in Ms. Mayawati’s outreach to the Muslim community, who form 19.5 percent of the State population.

Mr. Pandey belongs to the Brahmin community, whom the BSP has been aggresively wooing for over a decade now. Last July, Ms. Mayawati had also appointed Munquad Ali, as the BSP’s U.P. president, in a bid to balance equations.

While appointing him, Ms. Mayawati had promised Muslims she would not remove Munquad Ali from the post and would leave “no stone unturned” in giving importance to the community.

However, on Monday, the BSP supremo said that since Mr. Munquad Ali and Mr. Danish Ali belonged to the “same community”, a change was required keeping in mind “social harmony” within the party.

The change comes at a time when the BSP has spoken out against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, calling for its withdrawal and also demanded that the government withdraw cases against “innocent” protesters.

BSP MP from Bijnor Malook Nagar from the Gurjar community, has been appointed as the deputy leader of the party in the Lok Sabha.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k77k87/article30313665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5132,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bsp-appoints-ritesh-pandey-as-party-leader-in-lok-sabha/article30570485.ece

The High Court declined to interfere with the December 2, 2019, decision of a special court here.

While granting him relief, the special court had directed Mr. Puri, who had been in ED custody since September 4, 2019, not to “tamper with evidence” or “try to contact or influence the witnesses”.

99,2020/01/15,Annual Status of Education Report flags poor learning outcomes in schools,"Only 16% of children in Class 1 in 26 surveyed rural districts can read text at the prescribed level, while almost 40% cannot even recognise letters, according to the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2019, released by NGO Pratham on Tuesday.

Only 41% of these children could recognise two digit numbers.

However, ASER found that the solution is not to spend longer hours teaching children the 3Rs.

Counter-intuitively, the report argues that a focus on cognitive skills rather than subject learning in the early years can make a big difference to basic literacy and numeracy abilities.

ASER surveyors visited almost 37,000 children between 4 and 8 years in 26 rural districts across 24 States.

They asked each child to do a variety of tasks testing cognitive skills — sort images by colour and size, recognise patterns, fit together a four-piece animal puzzle — as well as simple literacy and numeracy tests. Social and emotional development was tracked through activities using cards with faces showing happiness, sadness, anger and fear.

The survey shows that among Class 1 children who could correctly do none or only one of the tasks requiring cognitive skills, about 14% could read words, while 19% could do single digit addition. However, of those children who could correctly do all three cognitive tasks, 52% could read words, and 63% could solve the addition problem.

“ASER data shows that children’s performance on tasks requiring cognitive skills is strongly related to their ability to do early language and numeracy tasks,” says the report. “This suggests that focussing on play-based activities that build memory, reasoning and problem-solving abilities is more productive than an early focus on content knowledge.”

Global research shows that 90% of brain growth occurs by age 5, meaning that the quality of early childhood education has a crucial impact on the development and long-term schooling of a child. The ASER report shows that a large number of factors determine the quality of education received at this stage, including the child’s home background, especially the mother’s education level; the type of school, whether anganwadis, government schools or private pre-schools; and the child’s age in Class 1.

Private schools ahead

Of six-year olds in Class 1, 41.5% of those in private schools could read words in comparison to only 19% from government schools. Similarly, 28% of those in government schools could do simple addition as against 47% in private schools. This gap is further exacerbated by a gender divide: only 39% of girls aged 6-8 are enrolled in private schools in comparison to almost 48% of boys.

The report also found that a classroom could include students from a range of age-groups, skewing towards younger children in government schools. More than a quarter of Class 1 students in government schools are only 4 or 5 years old, younger than the recommended age. The ASER data shows that these younger children struggle more than others in all skills. “Permitting underage children into primary grades puts them at a learning disadvantage which is difficult to overcome,” said the report.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tod951/article30552753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGMYSURUDIGITALLEARNING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aser-flags-poor-learning-outcomes-in-schools/article30569671.ece

101,2020/01/15,SVBC row: probe fails to make headway,"A Vigilance investigation ordered by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) to verify the authenticity of a controversial audio recording involving Prudhviraj Balireddy, the chairman of Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel (SVBC), has failed to make any headway two days on.

The actor-turned-politician found himself in the midst of a furore after the audio clip, purporting to be a conversation that he had had with a woman, went viral on social media recently. Mr. Balireddy resigned from his position soon after the audio clip surfaced, and it is learnt that he stepped down voluntarily after being told to do so by the Chief Minister who was briefed by TTD chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy.

SVBC, the broadcasting arm of the TTD, is generally considered as a department working under its administrative control, but few know that it is a registered company where decisions are mostly taken independently, albeit within the framework of the TTD and in consonance with the trust board.

Mr. Prudhviraj was initially inducted into the board as a director. The board subsequently approved his appointment as chairman. Though he resigned from the post on Sunday evening, on a non-working day, the resignation is yet to be received by authorities concerned. The move is said to have come as a surprise to the SVBC, which is bound to inform all developments to the Company Law Board.

The Vigilance probe has made little progress, except for getting facts from a senior police officer. There is no written complaint of harassment from anyone, nor was any ‘victim’ identified. “The telephone conversation had no apparent hint of harassment. It has to be seen how the Vigilance would take the probe forward,” a senior TTD official told The Hindu.

Meanwhile, SVBC employees staged a demonstration demanding removal of all employees engaged on an ad-hoc basis after Mr. Prudhviraj took over. The voice in the audio clip is said to be that of a film technician in the make-up section hired by SVBC ahead of the Brahmotsavams, whose services had since been dispensed with some time ago. “There are numerous allegations of irregularities and harassment. The episode brought disrepute to the organisation and the female employees are facing the heat after the audio went viral on social media”, said SVBC Employees Association honorary president and CITU district secretary K. Murali.

Political heat

TDP general secretary and former TUDA chairman G. Narasimha Yadav demanded that Mr. Prudhviraj be booked under the Nirbhaya or Disha Act. INTUC district President P. Naveenkumar Reddy flayed the successive governments for turning SVBC into a political rehabilitation centre, which had led to such ‘unfortunate’ incidents. He demanded that the chairman’s post be abolished forthwith and the job entrusted permanently to a senior bureaucrat.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/svbc-row-probe-fails-to-make-headway/article30570422.ece

‘Goda Kalyanam’, the celestial wedding of Sri Andal Ammavaru, also known as Godha Devi, was performed amid chanting of Vedic hymns and musical retreat by artistes of Annamacharya Project, even as the processional deities of Sri Ranganatha and Goda Devi were being brought from Sri Govindaraja Swamy temple.

‘Tiruppavai Parayanam’, the rendition of the 30 hymns, penned by Goda Devi, taken up on a huge scale by the TTD, came to a grand close at all the 243 centres across the country.

Procession

Noted orator and professor at Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha Chakravarthy Ranganathan presented the hymns along with the literary as well as metaphorical meanings, which turned out to be a feast for the ears of the devout. Prof. Ranganathan also gave an impressive lecture on the glory of ‘Tiruppavai’ at Sri Ahobila Mutt premises coinciding with the holy Margazhi month.

As a grand finale, the week-long ‘Neerattotsavam’ of Sri Andal observed at Govindaraja Swamy came to a close on Monday evening.

105,2020/01/15,Festive shoppers keep markets buzzing on eve of Sankranti,"The markets in Vizinaagaram and Srikakulam districts have been doing brisk business ahead of Sankranti festival. The traders say that good harvest this year has ensured the money flow, enabling people to spend during the festive season.

The Balaji textile market and shops along the Mahatma Gandhi Road in Vizianagaram were seen jam-packed with festive shoppers on Tuesday.

The traders say that the business was dull in the Sankranti season last year as the farmers had lost their crops to Cyclone Titli which hit hard the districts in October, 2018.

Heavy crop loss forced the farmers into debt trap. As a cascading effect, the business in the Sankranti season was hit.

However, the farmers are happy this year though paddy is not fetching remunerative price in the open market. “Farmers have managed loans easily as they are assured of income from the sale of paddy in the next few days. With abundant of rain in July and August last year, we have got a decent yield this year. After gap of many years, we have money to spend during the festival this year,” says B. Chandra Rao, a farmer of Duppada village in Vizianagaram district.

Amma Vodi benefits

Further, the release of Amma Vodi benefits ahead of Sankranti appears to be a boon for many families to celebrate Sankranti. “We have to pay school fees in June. We have ample time to adjust the amount. The Amma Vodi benefits have helped us to celebrate the festival happily this year,” says A. Aruna, a resident of China Bazaar in Vizianagaram.

The jewellery market in Srikakulam is witnessing brisk business, despite the gold prices are hovering between ₹39,000 and ₹40, 000 per ten grams. “All shops have been wearing a deserted look for many months with the upward trend in gold prices. However, the business is good ahead of Sankranti as many farmers are investing their earnings in gold,” says T.

The debate topic was ‘CAA, NRC and the idea of India’. Suvāda, an IIM-B initiative, is a public platform where issues of public importance, significance, and relevance will be discussed to provide a neutral space for informed discussions.

“We cannot see the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in isolation. It has to be seen as a larger project which the current dispensation has been pursuing for a long time and has been its ideological basis of giving privilege to one religion over every other,” said Mr. Gowda.

Mr. Dasgupta argued that the CAA did not have the power to take away citizenship of anyone in the country, and that NRC was a fast track provision to grant citizenship to other refugees or illegal immigrants, taking into consideration specific historical circumstances. “The primary beneficiaries of CAA are the Bengalis who came to India from Bangladesh during and after the 1971 war. NRC is an exercise of identifying who are and who are not citizens in the country. Such a project has been long overdue as we are by nature, largely under-documented,” he said.

107,2020/01/15,Lacunae in fire safety preparedness of Devaraja Market identified,"The over a century-old Devaraja Market, whose fate is swinging between demands for restoration from heritage conservationists to calls for its reconstruction from structural engineers, is also staring at lacunae in its fire safety preparedness.

A fire safety audit carried out by the State’s Fire and Emergency Services recently asked the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC), under whose purview the market falls, to comply with a series of recommendations that include the construction of a underground water tank with a capacity of 2 lakh litres on the premises. The Mysuru District Fire Officer visited the market on December 28, 2019, for an audit and submitted a report on fire prevention, fighting and evacuation measures considered ‘absolutely essential’ for the market.

The market, which houses more than 1,000 shops and stalls, is spread across 15,383 sq.m. and has a total built-up area of 5,380 sq.m. including 603 on the first floor. A portion, where a variety of combustible and inflammable items are stored, often reports fires such as the one in August 2019. Department officials had attributed this fire to a short-circuit among other reasons.

After the audit, authorities have been asked to not only construct a large underground 2 lakh litre water tank, but also keep fire extinguishers for every 100 sq.m. of built-up area, a first aid hose reel 30 m long near each staircase, with delivery hose pipes, etc.

The Fire Safety recommendations on December 30, 2019, also include an electric driven pump and one diesel driven pump near the underground tank, each capable of delivering 1,620 litres of water per minute and a diesel generator for alternative power supply to all emergency provisions of the whole building.

The Chief Fire Officer also asked authorities to mark on the corridor in luminous paint the directions in which occupants of the building and public have to move in the event of any emergency. They have also been asked to put up notice boards with directions on action to be taken in the case of emergency and the phone number of nearest fire station, 101, and ambulance service.

The audit found the market complying with safety requirements like accessibility to the premises, number of entrances and width of entrances. “Even if the authorities provide most of the equipment, where is the space to construct the underground tank,” asked S.P. Thirumala Rao, Karnataka Consumers’ Forum, on whose application under RTI for details of fire safety requirements the audit was carried out. Keeping safetyin mind, the authorities should either reconstruct the market or retain it as a heritage building of ornamental value, said Dr Rao.

The notice was issued on a petition filed by Sooppy Narikkatterui and P. Hashig, Indian Union Muslim League leaders in Kozhikode.

‘Use 2019 list’

The petition sought a directive to the commission to prepare the electoral roll on the basis of the draft electoral roll prepared for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

The petitioner pointed out that as per Section 16 (2) of the Kerala Panchayati Raj Act, a draft electoral roll shall be published at the respective panchayat and village offices and at the headquarters of the block and taluk offices for voters to verify it.

The final list should be published after considering the objections and applications. The election to the local bodies will be held in October 2020.

The SEC had now issued a directive to the election officers to renew the electoral roll of all local bodies keeping the voters’ list of 2015 as the draft roll.

They said that the electoral roll was renewed for the Assembly election in 2016 and later for the Lok Sabha elections.

If the electoral roll in 2015 was taken as the draft for the local body polls, it would cause huge inconvenience to voters to enter their names on the list.

The first-of-its-kind endeavour to be undertaken for artisan community in the country, the mapping of the skilled workers scattered across the State is aimed at securing their livelihood by ensuring that they are available for government and other projects. The project is being executed by the Kerala State IT Mission. At least 10 lakh artisans are expected to register in the initial phase.

Skill-specific projects

Mr. Jayarajan said the databank would open many opportunities for the unorganised sector. It would enable the formulation of projects in specific skill areas such as handicrafts, pottery, and sculpting.

The Minister added that the databank could be linked with cooperative societies to be launched in each district to employ youths in various activities in the areas. He also stressed on the increased role for traditional artisans in developing eco-friendly alternatives to plastic, such as mud pots. KADCO chairman Neduvathoor Sundaresan said the databank would help identify artisans required for projects executed using loans provided by the National Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation with the State government standing as guarantee.

116,2020/01/15,Nigerian arrested for online job fraud,"The Kerala Police have arrested a Nigerian national on the charge of operating an online job racket.

A team led by Deputy Inspector General of Police Sanjay Kumar Gurudin arrested the accused from Mumbai. The police identified the suspect as Kolawole Boboye.

He had arrived in India on a student visa. He had repeatedly indulged in various online advance fee frauds, an official said.

The accused had allegedly sent emails to various persons offering them placements in the United States. A resident in Thiruvananthapuram, Nandana, rose to his bait.

Over several months, the victim electronically transferred cash to various account numbers sent to her by the suspect. The Nigerian had allegedly promised the trained pharmacist a job in Flowers Hospital in Dutton in the United States. The accused had siphoned off ₹1.3 lakh from the woman as an advance fee for processing her job visa and making her travel and stay arrangements.

Digital footprints

When her prospective “employment agent” turned incommunicado, the victim approached Mr. Gurudin. The DIG put Dy.SP, Cybercrime, P. Giji, in charge of the case.

The investigators traced the digital footprints left by the suspect on internet banking sites and social media and tracked his mobile phone communication. Several leads turned cold, but the investigators soon struck gold. They followed the accused to his location in Mumbai. The police said the suspect used many ATM cards and fictitious identifies for the fraud. They said the fraud detected so far was just the tip of the iceberg.

The accused was produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court, Thiruvananthapuram, and remanded in judicial custody.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nigerian-arrested-for-online-job-fraud/article30570327.ece
117,2020/01/15,"No police data sharing with ULCCS, govt. informs HC","The State government on Tuesday informed the Kerala High Court that the IT division of the Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS) has not been authorised to access Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) data or the software as part of ‘blockchain passport verification’.

In an affidavit filed in response to a petition of Congress State secretary Jyothikumar Chamakkala challenging an order granting the society access to the CCTNS, the government pointed out that no CCTNS data were being shared with the ULCCS or any other extraneous agency.

The court had earlier stayed the order granting the society access to the CCTNS.

The affidavit further said the ULCCS had been entrusted with the task of developing proof of concept of the application for providing passport verification/police clearance certificate.

The access was not meant for the ULCCS team but for the application software developed by the ULCCS team.

The ULCCS had been instructed that after completing the development of the application, it should be transferred to the State police.

The application shall be accessed and used by the system administrator of the Kerala Police and that the ULCCS shall have no access to the software.

The earlier orders issued by the government had not been given effect till date. The misgiving about the data being shared with the ULCCS had arisen because of a typographical error in the order.

The State Police Chief had already issued an order in this regard on January 10.

The affidavit further said the CCTNS application was being used by all State police forces in the country. Though the blockchain-based passport verification application had been developed by the ULCCS, it did not have access to the data held either by the passport verification application or the CCTNS application.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-police-data-sharing-with-ulccs-govt-informs-hc/article30570304.ece
118,2020/01/15,Trekkers set off to summit Agasthyarkoodam,"The year’s trekking season to Agasthyarkoodam, which got under way on Tuesday, is set to witness an increased participation of women.

As many as 170 women have registered for the 36-day trekking season, a significant increase from the 103 women who scaled the second highest peak in the State last year after the Forest Department had lifted its ban on women in climbing the mountain range, following a High Court order.

A group of 116 trekkers, including three women, set off after the trek was flagged off from the Bonacaud forest picket station by Bonacaud grama panchayat member Satheesh Kumar.

Thiruvananthapuram Wildlife Warden J.R. Ani, Assistant Wildlife Wardens J. Suresh, Satheesan N.V. and Bonacaud eco-development committee president Maheen were present. The trekkers were sensitised to the precautionary steps to be adopted during forest fires.

The Forest Department has deployed 32 guides and forest personnel to accompany the trekkers during the season. Two women personnel have also been stationed at the Athirumala base camp. Halting places have been set up at Lathimotta, Karamanayar, Aattayaar, Ezhumadakkan Theri and Athirumala. Accommodation facilities have been restricted to Athirumala where a canteen will also function. A strict ban has been imposed on plastic and other items that could pollute the biodiversity hotspot.

119,2020/01/15,"KLF holds plenty for literature, cultural buffs","The fifth edition of the Kerala Literature Festival, which opens on the Kozhikode Beach on Thursday, promises plenty for the literary and cultural enthusiasts of Malabar and beyond. About 500 speakers, including several from overseas, will speak in 215 sessions over four days.

The good thing about the KLF is that it covers a wide spectrum and is not merely about literature. Environment is one of the themes for this year's festival.

The man whose name crops up about in just about every discussion for the last couple of years, following the massive floods that devastated the State, Madhav Gadgil, will be the biggest attraction in the segment on environment along with UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment Thani Bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi.

History is another theme that will have multiple sessions. A host of historians, including Ramachandra Guha and William Dalrymple, are among the speakers.

Writers from different Indian languages and English would, of course, handle many sessions. Some of them such as Shashi Tharoor will feature in multiple programmes.

“We are glad that some of our speakers, such as Tharoor, have also agreed to moderate some sessions,” Ravi Deecee, the man behind the festival, told The Hindu.

Spain, country in focus

Spain, Ravi added, was the country in focus of the KLF this time around. “The language we are focussing this year is Tamil,” he said.

Besides literature, there will be discussions on topics such as cinema, music, politics, sports, science and feminism. The impressive list of speakers include Anand, K. Satchidanandan, T. Padmanabhan, M. Mukundan, Zacharia, Taslima Nasrin, Devdutt Pattanaik, T.M. Krishna, Jairam Ramesh, Kapil Sibal, Chetan Bhagat, Karan Thapar, I.M. Vijayan, Keith Jarrett, Kalamandalam Gopi, M.

120,2020/01/15,'Pattas' movie review: Masala and martial arts come together in this predictable outing,"It is not an odd coincidence that Durai Senthilkumar's commercial films seem to be par for the course.

His films rarely overwhelm the viewer with a particular sentiment — for example the father-daughter sentiment in Viswasam. His heroes are not infallible, but they do overcome the difficult situations they are presented with. The female leads are influential; they either set or alter the course of the story, and also tend to leave a mark in the climax sequence. The general drift of the screenplay goes like this — the hero proves a point to the society and/or the hero exacts revenge.

Essentially, Durai Senthilkumar devised his version of a working formula, and sticks to it religiously every time he makes a movie. Pattas is no different. It neither offers nor leaves any space for subtext.

The film follows the life of Sakthi aka Pattas (a clean-shaven Dhanush), a petty thief.

Movie name: Pattas Director: RS Durai Senthilkumar

Starring: Dhanush, Sneha, Mehreen Pirzada, Naveen Chandra, Nasser

Storyline: A familiar tale of a son seeking revenge for his slain father packaged in a script held together by martial arts.

Pattas' universe is smaller than you'd expect. The conflict for later scenes is set in motion right at the beginning, when Pattas and his sidekick Puncture break into a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) training academy, and steal trophies and other paraphernalia belonging to Nilapparai aka Nilan (Naveen Chandra).

Pattas does not know then just how much Nilan has impacted his life in the past. Enter Kanyakumari (Sneha, in a strong comeback role), who helps Pattas to reconnect with his martial arts lineage.

In the second half, which unfolds as flashback, we are introduced to Thiraviyam Perumal (Dhanush again, retaining much of his post-Asuran facial hair), an exponent of the ancient Tamil martial art form of Adimurai. No prizes for guessing how Thiraviyam Perumal is related to Sakthi. After a series of events (read as: deceit, betrayal and violence), the story returns to the present with the climax portion, which is equally about whether one martial art form prevails over another as it is about the hero versus villain.

The downside to presenting a story with such broad strokes is that it is easy to predict where it is headed. But much needs to be spoken about Dhanush's presentation.

The actor rarely shifts out of second gear in a performance that he could have aced in his sleep. Sakthi is a call back to his days playing the carefree youth in films like Uthamaputhiran.

Pattas is basically 'Chill bro'. But the lack of clever writing brings down his chillness factor several notches. In its absence, the leading man's earnest attempt at comedy falls flat. It is in these times that one cannot help but wonder if this is why Tamil filmmakers tend to depend so much on Yogi Babu for comedy. Would he have made a significant difference? Judging by Darbar's case, he might have.

Then there is Mehreen Pirzada, who plays Sadhana Sha. Perhaps the director's note said that her character is supposed to be funny, but we fail to get that memo.

Also Read This is how Mehreen Pirzada pranked Dhanush while shooting for ‘Pattas’

Tethering the second half together with scenes depicting the ages old martial art form of Adimurai is an interesting choice. The film's producers used this idea to brand their product as a sports film.

Here is the problem with that. Sports dramas work by milking the underdog sentiment. But Thiraviyam Perumal is presented as the numero uno in Adimurai. He'd even manage to kill Chuck Norris, and we know that is not possible.

Secondly, a martial art form is not a 'sport' that a viewing audience can get behind. One of the reasons why Jackie Chan was able to export his Kung fu films to Hollywood was its humorous presentation. And Bruce Lee, who went before him, looked every bit the fighter that he was. But Tamil cinema lacks action heroes who can convincingly pass off as fighters (even a Jean-Claude Van Damme equivalent is missing).

Besides, the fight scenes involving the younger Dhanush in the climax lacked in bite. He knocks trained fighters down with one swift move inside a cage. When Nilan asks if Sakthi could be ready to fight with less than three months of training under his belt, Kanyakumari responds that Adimurai is in his blood!

Pattas isn't any less engaging because of this dialogue, but the day Tamil cinema obliges to exclude such dramatically oversold understanding of genetics is perhaps when we just might be able to see a better martial arts film.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7ws0rz/article30572501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pattas,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pattas-movie-review-masala-and-martial-arts-come-together-in-this-predictable-outing/article30572502.ece
121,2020/01/15,Former Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan passes away,"Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan, retired Chief Justice of the Gujarat High Court and also former Acting Chief Justice of Madras High Court, died aged 92 in Chennai on Wednesday. He is survived by his two sons P.G. Sundararaman and P.G. Ramkumar.

Hailing from Puliyangudi village in Mannargudi Taluk of Thanjavur district, he was born to an agrarian family and did his schooling at the Hindu High School in Triplicane, Chennai. He graduated from the Presidency College before obtaining a law degree.

In 1967, he was appointed as the State Public Prosecutor and subsequently became the Advocate General when he conducted many famous cases including the one filed against actor M.R. Radha for having shot former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran.

After getting appointed as a permanent judge of the Madras High Court in July 1969, he served the institution for 16 years. He got elevated as the Chief Justice of Gujarat High Court in 1985 and retired from service in 1990.

During his stint as Chief Justice, he had also acted twice as the Governor of Gujarat. Post retirement, he headed the then newly constituted Backward Classes Commission in Gujarat for a period of three years and framed the rules and regulations applicable to it.

According to a profile shared by his family members, Justice Gokulakrishnan was the chairman of the 125th year celebrations of the University of Madras when he was serving as the Acting Chief Justice of Madras High Court. Then, he took keen interest in creating Departments of Saivism, Vaishanavism, Jainism, Christianity, Annaism and Gandhian studies.

He also succeeded in obtaining many facilities such as cars, telephones and residential quarters for the District Judges and Chief Judicial Magistrates in the State. When he was the judge of the Madras High Court, the Centre appointed him to a one-man tribunal.

The purpose of the tribunal was to decide whether the Centre was justified in banning Sikh organisations such as All India Sikh Students Federation, Dal Khalse and Khalistan Movement. He declared all those organisations as unlawful.

In 1997, he headed another one-man Commission of Inquiry instituted by the State government to inquire into the death of traffic constable Selvaraj in Coimbatore and the consequent disturbance to law and order in Coimbatore city.

The very next year, he headed yet another Commission of Inquiry to probe the causes and circumstances that led to a series of bomb blasts in Coimbatore on April 14, 1998 and blamed the police for having failed to prevent the blasts.

He was conferred with Doctorate in Law by the Annamalai University in Chidambaram and was the president of Tamil Isai Sangam for nearly 24 years. He was also a member of the general council and executive council of the Cancer Institute at Adyar, Chennai.

Condoling the death, Dravida Munetra Kazhagam president M.K. Stalin recalled that Justice Gokulakrishnan had the rare honour of the Gujarat State Cabinet having accorded him a farewell when he retired as the Chief Justice of the High Court in that State.

“The incident proved to be a great honour for Tamil Nadu,” he said and stated that his report on the Coimbatore bomb blasts ensure justice for the common man. Mr. Stalin also recalled the former Chief Justice to have released the sixth volume of former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi’s autobiography titled Nenjukku Needhi.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2a3ci0/article30573169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GOKUL1KB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/former-chief-justice-of-gujarat-high-court-justice-pr-gokulakrishnan-passes-away/article30573022.ece

123,2020/01/15,I bow to people who uphold Constitution: PM Modi,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he bowed to the people of India who had, time and again, upheld the Constitution in letter and in spirit.

In a video message for the 50th anniversary event of Thuglak magazine in Chennai, Mr. Modi said, “I have always believed that there are two essential reasons that our great civilisation has prospered – India’s celebration of harmony, diversity and brotherhood, and the will and zeal of India’s people.”

“Whenever the people of India have decided to do something, no force has been able to stop them. My last five years in government have validated this belief. We have made remarkable progress because the change has been powered by 130 crore Indians,” he added. According to him, the people of India no longer wanted to be spectators, but active stakeholders in taking the nation forward. “Why else would senior citizens give up railway concessions? Why else would over one crore people give up their gas subsidies?” he asked. He said those who had ruled the country for many years loved to keep things in “pendulum mode”; keep things unsettled; cause the problem, further it and pretend to solve it. “Things have changed now. Our government has taken up the mission of solving problems that have persisted for many decades. Removal of Articles 370 and 35A (special status for Jammu & Kashmir), abolition of triple talaq, making GST a reality, 10% reservation for the upper caste poor, increased maternity leave up to 26 weeks, setting up of OBC commission,” he said, listing the issues his government has tackled.

The PM said vested interests were trying to mislead the confused (people) and cause unrest.

Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu released a special issue of ‘Thuglak @50’. “Only recently, there were disturbances on the campuses of one or two universities. The media has a major responsibility in such situations to give a correct picture and not take stands or provide distorted information.”

Mr. Rajinikanth took a jibe at the DMK, saying, “Those who carry Murasoli (DMK’s mouthpiece) can be immediately identified as DMK cadre. But those who carry Thuglak can be identified as intelligent.”

S. Gurumurthy, editor, Thuglak, said Jawaharlal Nehru University’s DNA was against the nation, and it should either be reformed or shut down.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/w033d5/article30570449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16THUGLAK504,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/i-bow-to-people-who-uphold-constitution-pm/article30570450.ece

“This has been clarified. The Prime Minister has also clarified the issue,” the CM said while addressing the media at the AIADMK office in Salem.

He reiterated his allegation that some Opposition leaders had for “political benefit spread news [against the NPR/NRC] that will create fear among the minorities, and people from minority communities are frightened”.

The CM said that even in the Assembly, “we have explained how NPR data would be collected, and minorities in the State need not fear or believe false propaganda”.

PMK leader’s claim

When asked about PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss’ claim that the AIADMK government was continuing thanks to the support it received from the PMK during the byelections, Mr. Palaniswami said such statements were being made to “energise their party cadre”.

The Chief Minister reiterated that elections to the rural local bodies were held in a free and fair manner in 27 districts.

Members of the AIADMK and coalition parties who won posts in the recently-held local body elections met the Chief Minister at the party office, where he felicitated them.

126,2020/01/15,PIL challenges appointment of special officer to Waqf Board,"A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court challenging the validity of a government order issued on September 18 by which the State government had superseded the Tamil Nadu Waqf Board for a period of six months and appointed IAS officer M.A. Siddique as a Special Officer.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha on Friday ordered notices returnable by February 24 to the government as well as Chief Executive Officer of the waqf board on the petition filed by K. Fazlur Rahman, 54, an advocate based in Chennai, who claimed that the GO was completely illegal and erroneous.

The GO passed by the Backward Classes, Most Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare Department stated that the government in 2017 constituted a 11-member board for a period of five years. The then Member of Parliament A. Anwhar Raajhaa chaired the board and it also comprised of MLAs K.A.M. Muhammed Abubacker and K.S. Masthan.

Further, since there was no Muslim member in the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, two designated senior counsel A. Sirajudeen and M. Ajmal Khan were nominated to the board. A. Tamilmahan Hussain was nominated as a person with professional experience apart from two scholars, two Muttawalis and a government nominee.

Subsequently, Mr. Raajhaa ceased to be a MP and consequently he could not continue either as chairman or even a member of the waqf board.

At the same time, a legal opinion obtained by the government stated that the two senior counsel in the board could be considered only as nominated members of the board and not as elected members.

Such opinion led to the nominated members of the board being more in number than the elected members which was not permissible under the Waqf Act of 1995. Hence, the government issued show-cause notices to the rest of the 10 members seeking their explanation as to why the government should not supersede the board.

Only four (K.A.M. Muhammed Abubacker, A.S. Fathima Muzaffer, Haja K. Majeed and Syed Ali Akbar) of the members replied to the show-cause notice and urged the government to drop the plan to supersede the board. They claimed that the two senior counsel should be considered as elected members and not nominated members.

However, On September 9, one of the two senior counsel Mr. Sirajudeen tendered his resignation citing personal reasons. Hence, the Government superseded the board on September 18 and appointed a Special Officer.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pil-challenges-appointment-of-special-officer-to-tn-waqf-board/article30570438.ece
127,2020/01/15,RSS functionary seeks deletion of sentence from Class X textbook,"A writ petition has been filed in the Madras High Court by P. Chandrasekaran, secretary of the Chennai chapter of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), objecting to a sentence in the latest Class X social science textbook of State board schools that the Hindu Mahasabha as well as the RSS had taken a “pronounced anti-Muslim stance” during the days that led to partition of the country on religious lines in the pre-Independence era.

Justice P.D. Audikesavalu has directed the government counsel to obtain instructions on the issue by January 22 from the School Education Department, the Tamil Nadu Textbook and Educational Services Corporation (TNTESC) and the Director of State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT).

In his affidavit, the petitioner insisted on deleting the “objectionable” sentence from English as well as Tamil versions of the textbook. Stating that the RSS had only opposed the partition of the country on religious lines and insisted on keeping the country united, Mr. Chandrasekaran said it had been “falsely misinterpreted” to mean as if the RSS had taken an anti-Muslim stance.

“If such wrong messages are included in the textbook meant for school students, it will lower the image of the organisation in the minds of the young people and it is highly objectionable,” he added.

The petitioner also asserted that the RSS never took a stand against any religion and was working only towards consolidation of the Hindu society, which was divided on caste lines. “In fact, the RSS has floated Muslim Rashtriya Manch, which works for the minorities, especially Muslims, and it has a large following in the Muslim community,” he said, and urged the court to order deletion of the controversial sentence from the textbook.

Large following

It was brought to the notice of the court that a representation was made to the School Education Secretary on the letterhead of Tamil Nadu unit of RSS on November 18 with a request to withdraw all copies of the textbook that had already been circulated, besides ordering deletion of the “derogatory” sentence from copies to be printed in future. A request was also made to order appropriate action against people responsible for inclusion of such a “false” statement.

The representation urged the official to act fast without forcing the organisation to resort to legal recourse. Yet, “the respondents have not taken any steps to remove the portion containing objectionable reference to the RSS till date. In view of the above, the petitioner is constrained to approach this court,” the affidavit read and sought an interim injunction restraining further distribution of the social science textbook reportedly printed on August 2.

Recalling the history of the organisation it stated that the RSS was founded by Keshav Baliram Hedgewar in 1925 for strengthening the foundations of Hindu society and preparing it for social, economical, cultural, religious, philosophical and political challenges.

“Expressed in simple terms, the ideal of RSS is to carry the nation to pinnacle of glory through organising the entire society and ensuring protection of Hindu Dharma,” the petitioner said.

He went on to state: “The RSS has a core principle of unity in working towards national diversity and harmony.

128,2020/01/15,We are sympathetic to Sri Lankan refugees: Union MoS for Home Affairs,"The Union government, which is “sympathetic” towards Sri Lankan refugees living in Tamil Nadu, will render whatever help it can to them, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy has said.

Responding to a question on whether the Central government would consider cutting the application fee for obtaining an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card, as such a move would be beneficial to eligible refugees, Mr. Reddy told The Hindu over the phone that as he was “new” to the department and was not aware of the details of the fee, he would discuss the matter with officials. However, “our sympathy is with the refugees”, he reiterated.

[According to the website of the Bureau of Immigration, which comes under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, the application fee in respect of applications submitted in India is ₹15,000, and for applications submitted outside the country, the fee is $275, or the equivalent in the local currency, for each applicant].

Renuka Selladurai, a Sri Lankan citizen residing in Tiruchi with an OCI card, said if the Central government came forward to reduce the fee, it will be very helpful to many refugees or fellow Sri Lankans who may be required to remain in the State for a long period of time. More people will be encouraged to obtain the OCI card, she said, citing the decision of the family of a close relative not to apply for the card on the ground of affordability.

Ms. Selladurai explained that the card was generally provided to those of Indian origin, on production of documentary proof. “Barring voting rights and acquisition of agricultural land, OCI cardholders get life-long visa and are as good as Indian citizens,” she pointed out, adding that her daughter had also obtained an OCI card.

The card will come in handy to those who were finding it difficult to land jobs commensurate with their educational qualifications due to the ‘refugee’ tag, said a refugee living in a camp in Tirunelveli district. His brother’s wife had obtained an OCI card recently. The refugee and Ms. Selladurai felt there was a strong case for creating greater awareness about the OCI card scheme.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nuci8y/article30570428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15GKISHANREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/we-are-sympathetic-to-sri-lankan-refugees-says-union-minister/article30570429.ece

Lyricist Snehan, Makkal Needhi Maiam’s youth wing secretary, claimed that the campaign, called Arasiyal Pazhagu, which was launched on World Youth Day on Sunday, will reach out to youngsters across every district of the State over the next 52 weeks.

As part of the initiative, the party has raised several questions on political issues on its Twitter handle. Mr. Snehan said the idea was to remind the Tamil youth about pressing issues and the politics surrounding them.

“We wanted to create awareness about politics among the youth. We also want to learn from them. The idea is to speak about the history of the existing problems and what has happened previously that has led to this – why are women unsafe, why do we have the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test. There is a need to go beyond the shrill politics that is being practised today,” he said.

He and party leaders would tour the districts and speak to the youth about the problems faced by them.

“We will get scholars and historians to talk about many of the issues.

134,2020/01/15,"Bumrah’s yorkers, bouncers surprise Warner","Swashbuckling Australian opener David Warner says he was surprised by the yorkers and bouncers of India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah in the ODI series-opener here.

Warner, who remained unbeaten on 128 in his team’s 10-wicket win against India at the Wankhede Stadium, negated Bumrah’s challenge well on January 14.

Skipper Aaron Finch also hit a blazing hundred (110 not out) as the Australians romped home with plenty to spare.

Asked how he prepares for bowlers like Bumrah and chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, Warner, one of the best left-handers in the world, said it was all about keeping still.

“It’s about being nice and still. I can’t imagine someone like Brett Lee running in from almost the boundary and just sort of staggering in there and all of a sudden bowl 150kmph, it takes a while to get used to and that’s great skill from Bumrah.

India's Jasprit Bumrah bowls a delivery during the first one day international (ODI) cricket match against Australia at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2020.

“His (Bumrah’s) bouncers surprise you, his yorkers surprise you and then when he bowls the change-up it’s very, very difficult, it’s like when Lasith Malinga at his prime, he bowled 140kmph and swung them.

”... But you knew you were going to get a yorker or a bouncer but it was how are you going to play that and that’s what’s so unique,” added Warner.

Saying that he finds Kuldeep’s bowling a fraction slower, he admitted that picking chinaman bowlers was difficult.

“And with Kuldeep (Yadav), he’s got great change-ups as well. I find that he’s bowling a fraction slower these days, quite different to Rashid Khan who bowls at 100kmph, under lights I think left-arm chinamans are very difficult to pick,” he added.

Both Bumrah and Kuldeep had an off day at the Wankhede and would be raring to go when the two teams face off each other at Rajkot.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tl34fn/article30572427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WARNER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/bumrahs-yorkers-bouncers-surprise-warner/article30572428.ece
135,2020/01/15,Chhattisgarh government moves Supreme Court seeking to declare NIA Act arbitrary,"The State of Chhattisgarh on Wednesday filed a suit in the Supreme Court for a declaration that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act of 2008 gives arbitrary police powers to the Centre and remains a threat to the federal structure of governance.

The Bhupesh Baghel government said 'police' is a State power. Crimes that happen within the jurisdiction of a State comes within the investigative jurisdiction of the State Police. The Centre, through the NIA, cannot usurp the role of the State Police force investigation that happens within a State.

The Parliament enacted the NIA Act by acting beyond its legislative competence.

""The NIA Act, in its present form, not only takes away the power of conducting investigation by the plaintiff through Police but also confers unfettered discretionary and arbitrary powers on the defendant. Moreover, there are no rules governing the exercise of power which gives ample discretion to the defendant to exercise its power at any juncture without providing any reason or justification for the same,"" Chhattisgarh has challenged the constitutionality of the 2008 Act.

The provisions of the Act does not require the Centre to take prior consent from the State before taking over an investigation of a case in that State.

""This clearly repudiates the idea of State sovereignty as envisaged under the Constitution. The plaintiff (State of Chhattisgarh) submits that the scheme of NIA act is such that once brought in motion, it completely takes away the power of plaintiff to investigate the offences which have been categorised as scheduled offence under the NIA Act and which has been committed within the jurisdiction of the State,"" the suit contended.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4298nv/article30537200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chhattisgarh-government-moves-supreme-court-seeking-to-declare-nia-act-arbitrary/article30573125.ece

His wife Malka Bi told The Hindu that the septuagenarian had secured bail.

Mr. Shoaib heads the Rihai Manch, an organization with which he has helped acquit more than a dozen persons ""falsely"" implicated in terror cases, bringing him under police radar several times. In 2008, he was also brutally assaulted by fellow lawyers in Lucknow and Faizabad, in the court compound as they did not want him appearing for terror accused persons. Mr. Shoaib was among more than 1,240 persons arrested by the UP police over the violent protests in the state.

141,2020/01/15,Respond to Odisha’s plea on Polavaram project: SC instructs A.P.,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Andhra Pradesh government two weeks to respond with complete details on a plea made by Odisha on the construction of the Indirasagar Polavaram multi-purpose project.

Odisha raised concerns about the project and the conduct of the Centre in not informing the State on the issue of ‘stop work order’ being kept in abeyance periodically leading to the unhindered continuation of the project work.

The State is apprehensive that the construction of the dam by neighbouring Andhra and the spillway would result in the submergence of considerable amount of its territory, including protected tribal areas. It fears that proper environmental assessment and studies were not conducted on the backwater extent in the Sabari and Sileru parts of Odisha.

The State has further maintained that the Polavaram project on the Godavari river was in violation of the Godavari Water Dispute Tribunal award.

In June 2019, the Union Environment Ministry gave two years of extension and allowed the construction works related to the poject.

The Centre had stressed that the project was “important to the people of Andhra Pradesh as it would irrigate nearly three lakh hectares of land, generate hydel power with installed capacity of 960 MW and provide drinking water facilities to 540 en route villages, particularly in Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari and Krishna districts.

In 2011, the UPA government had asked Andhra Pradesh to stop construction work. However, in 2014, the NDA government declared it a national project. The Ministry had repeatedly kept the ‘stop work order’ in abeyance.

The project envisages the construction of an earth-cum-rock fill dam across the Godavari.

142,2020/01/15,BJP files police complaint over Maharashtra’s notice to schools on CAA,"A day after the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government issued show cause notices to private schools in the State found taking tutorials on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) filed a police complaint alleging ‘abuse of power’ by unknown government officials.

In a complaint filed at Matunga Police Station, BJP’s State vice-president Kirit Somaiya said the Maharashtra government machinery had created ‘terror’ among schools and students, who were merely participating in an awareness drive on the law passed by Indian Parliament. The show cause notices issued to schools participating in the awareness drive organised by ‘social organisations’ were unconstitutional and void, the BJP said in its complaint to the police.

“Maharashtra Government has issued an advisory (2019/136) to all schools asking them to desist from holding politically sensitive tutorials on CAA/NRC. The advisory is being used by the State School Eduction Department to terrorise teachers and students. The notices were served on January 13, demanding an immediate response from schools,” the party said in its complaint, adding that the State’s School Education Department had insulted the President of India and the Indian Parliament by acting against the awareness drive on CAA and NRC.

Mr. Somaiya further said the language used in the State advisory was ‘threatening’ and had crated an environment of fear among the State’s teaching community. The party demanded that the Mumbai Police should register an FIR in the matter at the earliest. “The State notices have played with the future of the students who just wish to be aware of their rights,” it said.

Earlier, School Education Minister and Congress leader Varsha Gaikwad had on Monday issued notices warning the schools to desist from holding lectures, classes or tutorials on the CAA and the NRC that have sparked nationwide protests.

Condemning the BJP for taking up such an exercise, she said the government would not allow any politics in the State’s schools. “We have asked all schools to teach motivational learning, health and hygiene. I request the school administrations to not play with young minds. Whatever politics you want to play, do it on different platforms.” She also said the BJP should not make any attempt to change history in schools. The move follows demands from her party and Cabinet colleagues to take action after a school in Mulund courted controversy for taking classes on the CAA.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-files-police-complaint-over-maharashtras-notice-to-schools-on-caa/article30572101.ece

However, the police said they had only entered the campus after receiving a message that members of the ABVP and the NSUI were likely to gather, posing the possibility of an escalation into a law and order issue at the Vidhyapith.

Some students of the university said a group of police personnel had entered the campus, located on Ashram Road, while they were preparing to celebrate the Uttarayan festival by flying kites with messages like “India Against CAA”, “No NPR, No NCR”.

According to the students, the policemen had also demanded their identity cards.

When confronted by the students, the police personnel said they had the right to enter the campus without taking anyone’s permission.

“If required, I would show my I-card to the varsity guard, but why to policemen when we are already inside the campus,” said an agitated student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “They didn’t tell us who allowed them to enter the campus,” the student added.

The students’ group had organised the kite-flying event with anti-CAA messages printed on the kites to express solidarity with their counterparts in Jamia Millia Islamia and Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU).

“We had received a message that workers of ABVP and NSUI were gathering at Vidhyapith and that they may confront there on the issue of CAA and NRC, so I had sent a team for routine patrolling,” said P.L. Mall, DCP Zone I.

145,2020/01/15,Madhya Pradesh to fight antimicrobial resistance,"The Madhya Pradesh government plans to fight microbial resistance by setting up surveillance systems to track drug use in humans and in agricultural fields, curbing the spread of infections in hospitals, and regulating the poultry industry. The second State after Kerala to develop an action plan, it will assist seven other States in February to chalk out strategies.

With a surveillance system for animals up and running, the government is going to rope in 13 government colleges, two divisional laboratories and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Bhopal to track resistance in humans now, said Pankaj Shukla, Joint Director, National Urban Health Mission, one of the authors of the action plan.

State-wide database

At the hospitals, he explained, microbiologists would perform culture tests on samples taken from patients to single out resistant bacteria, and as a result develop a State-wide database. “Accordingly, we can advise doctors to prescribe only effective medicines,” he said.

Antimicrobial resistance is the ability of microorganisms to develop resistance against drugs. Although the resistance is a natural phenomenon, many factors have contributed to its acceleration, such as the injection of growth promoters in poultry, use of chemicals, including anti-fungal chemicals, in agriculture, and unhygienic conditions in hospitals leading to infections. The result is prolonged illness, extended duration of therapy, increased risk of mortality, higher costs for patients and healthcare.

Keeping an ineffective drug out of supply over a period might result in a fall in bacterial resistance to it, said Mr. Shukla. “Rampant use of chloromycetin in 1950s rendered it ineffective. But it’s being used again to treat typhoid now, after remaining out of supply for 50 years,” he added.

‘Nominal decline’

Under the infection prevention and control component of the plan, prescribing the right medicine that does not cover a broad spectrum of diseases, controlling hospital-induced infections due to unhygienic methods, and scientific disposal of medical waste, could help bring down resistance, said Mr. Shukla. “According to a survey conducted in the State, the resistance has declined over a year, though nominally, when cleanliness was maintained in hospitals,” he added.

Though the State faced more resistance through antibiotics used in animals, antifungal resistance was an emerging issue. “We will focus on agriculture from next year and carry out surveillance on antibiotic use in farming,” Mr. Shukla said.

The plan boasts six strategic points of action to be taken up between one to three years from 2019 — awareness and understanding, knowledge and evidence, infection prevention and control, optimising the use of antibiotics, research and innovations, and collaborations. Moreover, the State government is focusing on inter-sectoral collaboration, while following the ‘one health approach’ (assessing both human and animal health).

Curb OTC sale

In a bid to regulate access to high quality antimicrobials, the government plans to curb over-the-counter (OTC) sale of drugs in a phased manner. “A ban cannot be imposed abruptly. For now, we are restricting the use of only 24 drugs, and developing a mobile application to prevent their sale without prescription,” said Mr. Shukla. An application would also be developed for doctors to optimise drug use and guide them.

The plan further aims at gradually phasing out the use of high priority, critically important antimicrobials for use in animals, and ban the use of antibiotics as growth promoters. In addition, the government plans to adopt a policy for licensing manufactures, distributors and sellers of antibiotics and feed.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-to-fight-antimicrobial-resistance/article30572098.ece
146,2020/01/15,Naveen Patnaik announces special package for migrant workers in Odisha,"In order to reduce distress migration and strengthen the workforce in Odisha, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik announced a special package for migrant workers of the State here on January 15.

Mr. Patnaik announced that employment under MGNREGA will be allowed for 200 days a year in 20 vulnerable blocks in four districts namely Bargarh, Bolangir, Nuapada and Kalahandi. A wage of ₹286.30 for unskilled workers will be given under MGNREGA, he added.

Inaugurating e-Shramik Samadhan, a 24x7 Shramik Sahayata Helpline, at a function at Jayadev Bhavan, Mr. Patnaik further announced that a State Corpus Fund of ₹500 crore has been created to ensure timely and uninterrupted payment under MGNREGA.

All the gram panchayats in those 20 vulnerable blocks will be covered as intensive gram panchayats under the Odisha Livelihoods Mission, Mr. Patnaik said. Each family in these areas will be brought under the Self-Help Group (SHG) fold.

In his address, Mr. Patnaik said that financial assistance from community investment fund (CIF) and vulnerability reduction fund (VRF) will be extended to these SHGs. Any person in distress can approach the local Block Development Officer for availing assistance from VRF.

The Chief Minister said that all SHG members will be covered under insurance and identified SHGs in those 20 blocks will be declared as banking correspondent in order to make availability of cash to the distress migrant workers. One eligible youth from every household (18 to 35 years) will be covered under placement linked skill development programme.

All eligible households will be provided with ‘pucca’ houses, announced Mr. Patnaik, while adding that a drive will be undertaken for all eligible construction workers for their registration under Odisha Building & Other Construction Workers Welfare Board and will be given marriage assistance, pension, education assistance and pucca houses along with other admissible benefits.

Mr. Patnaik said that a Central data base at the State level will be in place to track migrant workers and ensure linkage with welfare schemes. A comprehensive communication strategy will be prepared for behaviour change communication in the vulnerable areas, he added.

The initiatives for ensuring livelihood, employment linked skill development and asset creation will go a long way in helping the migrant workers, especially in mitigating distress migration, observed Mr. Patnaik.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/naveen-patnaik-announces-special-package-for-migrant-workers-in-odisha/article30573172.ece
147,2020/01/15,AAP releases full list of 70 candidates for Delhi,"The Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday released its full list of 70 candidates for the Delhi Assembly elections due on February 8.

All seven AAP Ministers got party tickets and three of its 2019 Delhi Lok Sabha election candidates — Atishi, Dilip Pandey, and Raghav Chadha — made it to the list. Also, leaders who joined the party in the last one week — Ram Singh Netaji, Vinay Mishra and Shoaib Iqbal — got tickets.

The party has announced 24 new faces while 15 sitting MLAs have been dropped.

The other two parties — the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party — have not yet announced their candidates for the elections.

“Best wishes to all. Don’t be complacent. Work v hard. People have lot of faith in AAP and u. God bless [sic],” AAP national convenor Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet.

148,2020/01/15,CAA tutorials: BJP files police complaint against govt.,"A day after the State government sent show cause notices to private schools found taking tutorials on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday filed a police complaint against the ‘abuse of power’ by unknown government officials.

In a complaint filed at Matunga police station, BJP’s State vice-president Kirit Somaiya said the government machinery has created terror among schools and students, who were merely participating in an awareness drive organised by “social organisations”. The notices are unconstitutional and void, the complaint said.

“Maharashtra government has issued an advisory (2019/136) to all schools asking them to desist from holding politically sensitive tutorials on CAA/NRC. The advisory is being used by the State School Eduction Department to terrorise teachers and students. The notices were served on January 13, demanding an immediate responses from schools,” the complaint said.

The complaint said the School Education Department has insulted the President and Parliament by acting against the awareness drive. It said the language used in the advisory is threatening and has created an environment of fear among the teaching community, and urged the Mumbai Police to register an FIR at the earliest. “The State notices have played with the future of the students who just wish to be aware of their rights,” it said.

School Education Minister Varsha Gaikwad had on Monday issued notices warning the schools to desist from holding lectures, classes or tutorials on the CAA and the NRC. Condemning the BJP for taking up such an exercise, she said the government would not allow any politics in schools in the State.

“We have asked all schools to teach motivational learnings, health and hygiene. I request the school administrations to not play with young minds. Whatever politics you want to play, do it on different platforms,” she had said.

The move followed demands from her party and Cabinet colleagues to take action after a school in Mulund courted controversy for taking classes on the CAA.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-tutorials-bjp-files-police-complaint-against-govt/article30570692.ece
149,2020/01/15,State to merge liquor taxes to plug leaks,"The State government will merge taxes and duties levied on liquor to increase revenue collection and plug leakages. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Tuesday approved slew of measures to shore up collection and boost the State’s economy, which is reeling under a debt of ₹4.72 lakh crore.

One of the proposals suggested merging the sales tax charged on liquor served by restaurants with excise duty levied at the manufacturers’ end. This would increase revenue collection by ₹200 crore, senior officials said.

The decision will effectively abolish value added tax (VAT) charged on liquor at restaurants, and subsume it into excise duty without impacting the eventual MRP on the bottled liquor. “The proposal is among four other measures, including reducing the number of dry days, suggested by the State Excise Department to boost revenue. Overall, a decision was taken to approve the merger,” said a senior government official.

The government currently collects ₹17,000 crore in excise levies, which are its third-largest source of revenue. About ₹9,000 crore of the collections are made by the Sales Tax Department in the form of VAT, but the Excise Department has been demanding a single point of collection to plug the leaks.

The State government collects 35% VAT on the MRP of country liquor, Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) and beer. “The move would certainly improve collections and at the same time make it easy to do business related to liquor. We are expecting improvements in compliance as well,” said the official.

Excise duty is paid at the manufacturers’ end, while the sales tax in the form of VAT is collected much later. States like Kerala and Karnataka have already merged the taxes and successfully managed to reduce evasion. The one-point collection of tax will improve liquidity in the State systeMMm, officials said.

Multi-member ward system to be reviewed

The State Cabinet will on Wednesday reconsider the multi-member ward system introduced in the local bodies by the previous BJP-led government. The Cabinet will also review the direct election of chairman in local bodies introduced in 2017 by the earlier government to gain better control of local bodies.

The prabhag system had then mandated that each ward would return three to five corporators instead of one or two, as was the earlier practice.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/state-to-merge-liquor-taxes-to-plug-leaks/article30570628.ece
150,2020/01/15,State to propose changes to new Motor Vehicle Act,"The State government is drawing up proposals to counter certain provisions under the Centre’s amended Motor Vehicle Act, 2019.

According to officials of the State Transport Department, the proposals will be aimed at bringing more parity between the quantum of penalty and the nature of the offence, which in certain cases has been deemed too high.

State Transport Minister Anil Parab said they are working on the proposals, and will present them to Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari. “We felt that in some cases, the penalties for certain offences were too high. One needs to look at the nature of the crime while penalising the person,” he said.

The Minister said that broadly, they are seeking to reduce the amount of fines or penalties for offences that did not pose an imminent threat to the person driving or those around him, or those that were minor transgressions. “If a person is riding a bike without a helmet within the confines of a residential area for his daily chores, he would not be speeding and doesn’t pose the same threat as someone on a main road,” he said.

Senior officials from the Transport Department said in cases of speeding, a single penalty for all those who breach the threshold may not be accurate. A person driving at 40 km per hour in a place where the speed limit is 30 does not pose the same threat as someone driving at 90 km per hour, one official said.

Mr. Parab, however, said they plan to be extremely strict against those committing traffic violations knowingly, such as driving under the influence of alcohol or driving on the wrong side of the road. “We will make sure that the punishment is so harsh that not only will they not commit the offence again, but it will also act as a deterrent to others,” he said.

Mr. Parab said they plan to finalise their proposals within eight days and then meet Mr. Gadkari.

After the amended Motor Vehicles Act was passed in 2019, several States refused to implement it. The Centre had written to all States earlier this month to implement the Act, failing which they would attract provisions of Article 356.

The new law has increased fines for not wearing a helmet from ₹100 to ₹1,000, along with a three-month disqualification of licence.

153,2020/01/15,‘Take action against Bajwa for revolt against CM’,"Punjab Ministers on Tuesday demanded disciplinary action by the Congress leadership against party leader and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa for raising a banner of revolt against Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on public platforms.

Ahead of the Cabinet meeting here on Tuesday, senior party leaders pointed out that despite repeated pleas asking Mr. Bajwa to express his opinions within the party forum, he continued to criticise Capt. Amarinder and his government in media and other platforms.

‘Wrong message’

The Ministers also accused Mr. Bajwa of playing into the hands of the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Aam Aadmi Party by pitching himself against his own party leadership.

A statement on behalf of the Ministers, which included Rana Gurmeet Singh Sodhi, Charanjit Singh Channi, Brahm Mohindra and Manpreet Singh Badal among others, said that such rebellion, if not nipped in the bud, could send the wrong message down the rank and file of the Punjab Congress.

157,2020/01/15,Coimbatore industries seek measures to boost demand,"With the Union Budget nearing, the industry associations here have submitted their demands and expectations to the Government.

The Southern India Mills’ Association has sought efforts to improve competitiveness of the industry, both, in the domestic and international markets. It should focus on the entire textile value chain so that imports are controlled, exports pick up, and the domestic market revives.

Import duty

The man-made fibre sector should be competitive in the international market. For this the Government should look at several measures. It should remove the 5 % import duty on man-made fibres. The MEIS (Merchandise Exports from India Scheme) is extended till the end of March and the exporters should be paid the benefits immediately.

The Government should also form a committee soon to finalise details of the Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies schemes. The Government should release immediately all the benefits due under the Government schemes, the Association said.

According to the Tiruppur Exporters’ Association, clusters such as Tiruppur face acute shortage of skilled labour. Workers need to be provided accommodation facilities to retain them.

Some of the units construct houses for the workers. While welcoming the housing facilities being executed under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) Scheme, the Association said that where the units contribute the amount voluntarily for construction of houses to its workforce, the contribution has to be treated as allowable business expenditure similar to Section 37 of the Income tax Act, 1961, preferably providing weighted deduction or at least deduction. It also sought formation of Knitwear Board that would function out of Tiruppur. The Board can handhold the industries in their growth journey.

Stability of cotton prices

The South India Hosiery Manufacturers’ Association, which has members catering to the domestic knitwear market, appealed to the Government to come out with a system that will stabilise cotton prices. This will ensure stability of cotton yarn prices and help the manufacturers plan the production cost. The tax for machinery made indigenously, the tax rate should be reduced to 5 % from 18 % or the rate should be brought under refundable system.

There should be mini knitwear garment manufacturing parks to generate more employment in rural areas in Tiruppur.

In the engineering sector, the Southern India Engineering Manufacturers Association has demanded preference for Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises in government tenders. The conditions in the tenders deprive the MSMEs of opportunities.

Both, the Bureau of Indian Standards and Bureau of Energy Efficiency, have increased the marking fees. The MSMEs should spared from the hike as it will lead to higher production cost.

Farmers should be supported to invest in equipment and pumpsets and this will, in turn, give a boost to the domestic machinery and pumpset manufacturers, the Association said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-industries-seek-measures-to-boost-demand/article30570802.ece
158,2020/01/15,Coimbatore Corporation replaces pipelines to stop water contamination in Azad Nagar,"Ending four months of complaint from Azad Nagar (Ward 85) residents, the Coimbatore Corporation on Monday supplied them contamination-free water.

According to sources, the residents were complaining that the Corporation was supplying water contaminated with sewage. The Corporation asked Suez India Pvt. Ltd. to look into the issue as the private company was in-charge of water supply maintenance for the old city area of 60 wards. The company engineers checked the pipelines and plugged a leak. But the complaints from residents continued. After the residents complained again, the company engineers rechecked the pipelines to plug another leak. As the complaint and repair alternated for a couple of times, the Corporation decided to change the network of pipeline in the affected area. The Corporation’s reasoning was that as Suez had to change the pipeline as part of its 24x7 drinking water distribution improvement contract, it might as well replace the pipelines now so that the residents received contamination-free water.

Based on the Corporation’s instruction, the company replaced pipelines for 1,600m covering three streets in Azad Nagar.

While replacing pipelines, it was found that the old PVC pipes were damaged when the Corporation undertook the underground sewer line work a few months ago.

The sources said that the Corporation replaced not only the main distribution line but also the house service connection pipes.

161,2020/01/15,Three held for stealing 15.6 tonnes of copra in Coimbatore,"Kangeyam police have arrested three persons on charges of stealing 15.6 tonnes of copra.

Police said that Karthikeyan of Kinathukkadavu owns a godown at Kamatchipuram in Kangeyam and it was managed by Tamil Selvan.

On January 11, the manager had hired a truck for dispatching copra to an oil mill at Irinjalakuda in Thrisssur. Three persons had come with the lorry and they loaded the copra on to the truck.

In the absence of papers relating to the truck, Tamil Selvan had asked them to bring the papers and retained the bills and the consignment.

When Tamil Selvan had briefly gone away, the three took the bills and escaped with the consignment. The truck was later found abandoned near Palakkad and the consignment was off loaded at a different oil mill there.

Based on a complaint, police secured Arunagirinathan (46), and Prabhakar (29) of Chennimalai in Erode and another person from Palakkad. Investigations are on.

Security strengthened at check posts

Coimbatore Rural Police have strengthened vigil at check posts along the Tamil Nadu – Kerala border by deploying armed police personnel.

The development comes in the wake of the murder of Special Sub Inspector Wilson at a check post in Kaliyikkavilai in Kanyakumari district on January 8.

163,2020/01/15,GST officials unearth fake invoice cases,"Officials of the Central GST Commissionerate here have detected issue of fake invoices without supply of goods.

A release from Principal Commissioner (GST) Rajesh Sodhi said investigations were initiated against three units - Aliya Enterprises, Vinayak Trading and Star International - and it was found that these units were doing only bill (invoice) trading without supply of goods. Mohamed Ariff was the main conspirator behind the bill trading. These invoices were used by several scrap dealers. Tax amount in the bill trading was availed as input tax credit and used for further bill trading. This was estimated to have resulted in ₹40 crore loss to the government in terms of revenue.

It was further found that about 15 entities had supplied invoices and more than 50 entities to whom these invoices had been sold. The money trail was also under investigation. The release said that the modus operandi used by these entities was that after the sale of invoice, the recipient transferred the proceeds, including GST, by banking channels. After receipt of consideration, the accused retained the commission, which varied between 10 % to 12 % and refunded the balance in cash.

The total cash withdrawals by the petitioner was about ₹60 crore and the balance turnover done by the petitioner was about ₹170 crore and it was not through banking channels. The Department had attached the suspicious bank accounts of the petitioner.

The main accused had approached the High Court and was ordered by it to deposit ₹5 crore and co-operate with the investigation. Mohamed Ariff paid ₹2 crore and approached the Supreme Court to relax the condition for granting bail. The Supreme Court issued orders last month, asking him to pay the remaining ₹3 crore. However, he failed to pay the amount within the stipulated time. He was arrested and remanded in judicial custody. Further investigation against various scrap dealers and end users was under progress, the release said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/gst-officials-unearth-fake-invoice-cases/article30570283.ece
164,2020/01/15,Underground drainage project in Coimbatore- a work in progress with little progress in work,"Nearly 10 years after it started work, sometime in 2010, the Coimbatore Corporation is yet to complete the underground drainage (UGD) scheme in 60 wards.

When it started the work to lay 650 km of sewer lines at ₹ 373 crore, the civic body had hoped to complete it within three to five years. But as of January 2020, the Corporation is still working at three places and waiting to begin work at others.

The Corporation started the UGD work with the Central Government’s funds under the then Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission to provide service to the then city of 72 wards – now the core city area of 60 wards.

It had divided the project into six packages. The first three were laying sewer lines and providing house service connections and the last three were the construction of sewage treatment plants in Ukkadam, Nanjundapuram and Ondipudur.

Of the six, the Corporation had completed only one package, the construction of the sewage treatment plant in Ukkadam, which it commissioned in 2011. It had built the plant at ₹ 55 crore to treat 70 million litres sewage a day.

But the Corporation has not had an opportunity to operate the Ukkadam plant to its installed capacity.

Officials in the know of the issue said the plant treated only less than half its installed capacity as the Corporation was to yet to provide house service connections to the residents of those areas from where it had planned to convey the sewage.

In 2017, the Corporation asked people in Selvapuram, Telugupalayam and Saibaba Colony among other areas to pay deposit and service charges to get UGD house service connection. But as the residents were reluctant to avail of the connection citing the deposit to be exorbitant, the Corporation decided to divert a portion of the money meant for Smart Cities project to fund the connection work.

The officials said the Corporation had earmarked ₹ 31 crore to provide 42,000 house service connections. And, as on date, the Corporation had given connections to 10,000 houses and hoped to complete the work by June 2020.

The Corporation said it would bear the deposit and sewer line laying charges and the beneficiary residents could pay it in instalments.

Legal challenges

In constructing the Nanjundapuram sewage treatment plant, the Corporation had to suspend work following objections from residents in the neighbourhood.

After surmounting the legal challenges, the Corporation resumed work, but not before cancelling the agreement signed with the contractor and floating a new tender to fix a new contractor by revising the project cost.

At the time of preparing the estimates, the first time the Corporation had pegged the plant cost at ₹ 33.79 crore. But due to the legal challenges and the time lost to fight those, the Corporation is now executing the work at ₹ 43.60 crore.

The officials said the Corporation was confident of completing the work by December this year.

Only after the Corporation completed the Nanjundapuram plant work, it would be able to take up the work to provide house service connections, the work of which would take a year after December 2020, the officials said.

The story about the Ondipudur treatment plant is more or less similar. The Corporation had completed the construction, but is unable to operate the 70-million-litre-a-day plant because it is struggling to lay the main sewer line to convey the sewage.

The officials said delay in obtaining the National Highways permission to cut across the Tiruchi Road to lay the line for 10 km was the reason.

After it had obtained, the contractor faced financial issues and that delayed the work further.

As per the latest report, the Corporation was yet to complete work on a four-km stretch between Alvernia School and the plant and the work was progressing, though at snail’s pace.

In laying sewer lines for 650 km across the city, the Corporation had excluded a few areas, though they fell well within in the old city area.

Areas excluded

At the time the Corporation was laying the pipelines, the then councillors had complained that the civic body had excluded areas in Wards 39, 40, 46, 37, 59 and 60.

Admitting that the civic body had not covered all the areas in the 60 wards, the Corporation officials said the civic body had prepared a new project to provide UGD coverage to the excluded areas.

The Corporation had estimated the project to cost ₹ 175 crore and was at present working on the financial model.

Even as it is struggling to bring a closure to the project, the Corporation sometime ago had begun UGD in two added areas – Kurichi and Kuniamuthur – at ₹ 442 crore.

The Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board that is executing the work on the Corporation’s behalf had completed around 40% of the work, said the Board sources.

The Corporation plans to provide UGD service to around 70,000 residents in the two areas covering 14 wards.

As part of the work, the Board is constructing a sewage treatment plant in Vellalore to treat around 30 million litres a day.

To provide UGD service to the nine other added areas, the sources said the Board had planned the work in three packages. It had prepared estimates for two and was working on the funding pattern and preparing the estimate for the third package.

The Corporation officials said as the UGD work it had undertaken with the JNNURM funds continued to linger on and as it would be taking up more projects, the Corporation should pay attention to completing the pending projects before taking up new ones.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/y92smn/article30570229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB15PIPELINES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ugd-project-a-work-in-progress-with-little-progress-in-work/article30570230.ece
165,2020/01/15,Anti-CAA protests: Delhi court grants bail to Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad,"The Tis Hazari Court on Wednesday granted bail to Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who was arrested for allegedly inciting violence during the anti-CAA protest in Daryaganj last month.

However, Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau ruled that the accused would not visit Delhi during the next four weeks, in view of the coming Assembly elections, he not being a permanent resident of, nor an elector in Delhi.

In case Mr. Azad visits Delhi for medical treatment, he will have to inform the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) and the Station House Officer of Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh, where he lives, about his schedule. The police will escort him. This directive is effective till February 16.

The court allowed bail on furnishing of a bond of Rs. 25,000 with two sureties of the like amount.

The other conditions include that Mr. Azad will mark his presence before the Fatehpur police station chief every Saturday for the next four weeks from the date or release.

Thereafter, he will have to appear on the last Saturday of every month till further orders. He has also been asked to surrender his passport and not indulge in any similar offence.

The court allowed a request of the accused to visit Jama Masjid, Jor Bagh and Guru Ravidas Temple for paying obeisance, but within 24 hours of his release. He will be escorted to his house in Fatehpur thereafter.

The court gave bail to Mr. Azad on various grounds, including that the police were unable to prima facie prove the allegation that he had given inflammatory speeches near Jama Masjid. No assessment of damage to properties had been carried out.

The provisions invoked against Mr. Azad were largely bailable; in the nine other cases he was on bail since February 2018 and that he had not been convicted in any of them; that he was in judicial custody for the past 25 days; and that he was suffering from a unique medical condition - polycythemia, for which he was undergoing treatment at AIIMS.

Also, the other 15 accused persons arrested for alleged violence during the protests had already been granted bail.

Dr. Lau started her order by invoking Rabindranath Tagore's poem ""where the mind is without fear...""

""I am reminded of our reverend patriotic poet Rabindranath Tagore, who is the most reverent today. He, during the Colonial Era in early 1900s, when the British followed the policy of Divide and Rule, visualised a national where there is no fear in the mind of people....,"" she said.

The order said: ""In our democratic set-up, we have a fundamental right to peaceful protest guaranteed by the Constitution...however, at the same time, our Constitution strikes a balance between the rights and duties. While exercising our right of peaceful protest, it is our duty to ensure that no corresponding right or another is violated and no inconvenience is caused to anyone.""

The court said violence or destruction of property was totally unacceptable and the organisers of protests would be liable to compensate for any damage to public or private property.

""Of course, it goes without saying thst protests do lead to inconvenience, but it has to be ensured that these protests do not last for a long time at places under public use,"" the order said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ytdpli/article30567795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHANDRASHEKHARAZAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/anti-caa-protests-delhi-court-grants-bail-to-bhim-army-chief-chandrashekhar-azad/article30572959.ece

The accused also hit the cars parked outside in their attempt to escape.

One of the accused, Jai Narayan, 28, a resident of Madhya Pradesh, was arrested from Sector 22 on Tuesday. A pistol, two live cartridges and the vehicle used in the commission of crime were seized. The police claimed that Jai was previously involved in several cases of robbery and was arrested on four occasions.

Jai purportedly told the police that he was drunk the previous night and was driving around aimlessly with his friends when they spotted a tent set up for Lohri celebration and gatecrashed into it. However, they opened fire on the guests after they were identified as outsiders.

The accused, in an SUV, had gatecrashed into a Lohri celebration organised by Ajay Vats, a Sector 40 resident, around 11 p.m. The young men asked the photographer to click their pictures and one of them then walked to the drinks table. When Mr. Vats enquired the young man about his identity, he pushed him off and tried to escape. But Ajay’s brother Vinay caught him. At this, one of the accused allegedly took out a pistol and fired two shots hitting Mr. Vinay in his right shoulder. Surrounded by guests, the five, in a bid to escape, opened indiscriminate fire hitting Pawan and Vineet on their legs.

The accused then drove off towards house no. 85, but were forced to take a U-turn with the road blocked due to another Lohri celebration. On their way back, the accused waved the pistol in the air to scare away Ajay and his relatives while they were getting into cars to take the injured to the hospital. The accused also hit a couple of cars parked on the road in their attempt to escape.

Mr. Vinay was taken to Max Hospital, while the rest of them were admitted to Fortis Hospital.

Station House Officer of Sector 40, Inspector Pawan Kumar said the injuries to the three were not serious and one of them was discharged from the hospital.

178,2020/01/15,Congress attacks government’s education model,"The Delhi Congress on Tuesday claimed that 46% of the AAP government’s education budget remained unspent “even as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has been claiming that his government’s education model was the best”.

Releasing a ‘Post-mortem Report’ on the AAP government’s education model, Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said that instead of improving education standards, the government helped contractors by whitewashing classrooms made during the Congress regime “to make it look like new ones”.

Former Education Minister Arvinder Singh Lovely said that when the Congress came to power, the budget for education was ₹866 crore. This was raised to ₹5,912 crore when the Congress demitted power. “In the last five years, the education budget went up to ₹26,577 crore but only ₹12,243.06 crore has been spent,” he said.

The leaders claimed that over 1,32,000 children have left government schools in the past four years. “Illiteracy rate in Delhi has increased from 1.7% to 3.4%, which also clearly proves the declining standard of education in the Capital. A total of 10,591 posts of Trained Graduate Teachers and Post Graduate Teachers have not been filled — which is 65% of the total strength,” they added.

179,2020/01/15,‘Why has no govt. official come to meet us?’,"Protesters at Shaheen Bagh on Tuesday said they respected the High Court’s position that law and order must be maintained but asked why no government official had come to meet them till now.

“We are talking to lawyers to plan our future course of action,” said Shaheen Kauser, a social activist who has been part of the anti-citizenship law protest at the site since it began on December 15. Ms. Kauser condemned the Centre for failing to take cognizance of the demands of the protesters.

“There has been no representation from the government,” she said, while demanding that a roll back of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens must be announced in writing.

On Monday, the area Station House Officer had appealed to protesters to leave one side of the road open but to no avail.

Meraj Khan, one of the organisers of the protest, said that such as move would cause safety issues.

“On multiple occasions outsiders have tried to cause trouble. Right now we keep a check on who is coming by checking ID cards, if one side is opened up, who will take that responsibility?” he said. Protesters also pointed out that the HC had not issued any directions to have the demonstrators removed.

Shortly after the HC’s direction were reported by the media, panicked protesters called up more supporters to come to Shaheen Bagh.

The situation, however, remained peaceful with the sit-in entering its 30th day on Wednesday.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/br5ss5/article30570553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL15-SHAHEENBAGH2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/why-has-no-govt-official-come-to-meet-us/article30570554.ece

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari alleged that during the last one year, 3,623 homeless people had died in Delhi but their bodies were not identified.

181,2020/01/15,Shaheen Bagh stir: HC asks police to look into traffic restrictions,"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the police to take a call on traffic restrictions on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch, which has been closed since December 15 due to protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Whenever any agitation or protest is going on, the situation is fluid... it keeps on changing with the temperament of the protesters and resistance by other people, the HC noted, adding: “As police has to maintain law and order... it has all power, jurisdiction and authority to control traffic — whenever protests or agitations are going on — in the larger public interest”.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar said the court cannot issue any direction as to how to handle the agitation or protest or the place of protest and the traffic. “It all depends upon ground reality and the wisdom of the police, where situation may keep changing every 10 minutes,” it said.

The order came on plea by advocate and social activist Amit Sahni who contended that the road closure was causing huge inconvenience and hardship to lakhs of commuters everyday who have been compelled to take different routes for the last one month.

The plea said that the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch was crucial as it connects Delhi, Faridabad (Haryana) and Noida (Uttar Pradesh). It added that commuters are forced to take alternative routes such as the Delhi-Noida-Delhi (DND) Expressway and Ashram, which is causing massive traffic jams.

The plea said that the temporary closure of the stretch and the Okhla underpass has been extended repeatedly. “Apart from the temporary road closures, traffic has also been affected as part of Mathura Road is dug up for the construction of an underpass, which is expected to ease the congestion at Ashram Chowk, Mathura Road and the adjoining arteries by connecting Nizamuddin to New Friends Colony,” the plea added.

The plea further contended that children who used the blocked stretch to reach their schools are now compelled to leave their homes two hours early in order to reach in time. It added that the authorities have failed to take appropriate action to give relief to the residents of the locality and lakhs of commuters of Delhi, U.P. and Haryana.

On January 10, the HC had refused to entertain a separate plea seeking directions for removal of demonstrators protesting against CAA at Shaheen Bagh.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cquwc9/article30570535.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16DESTREET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shaheen-bagh-stir-hc-asks-police-to-look-into-traffic-restrictions/article30570536.ece
182,2020/01/15,"‘AAP will lose polls over pollution, water quality’","The Aam Aadmi Party will lose the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections over issues of air pollution and contaminated water, the BJP claimed on Tuesday.

Former Union Minister and Rajya Sabha MP Vijay Goel attacked the AAP government for pursuing “dirty politics” over the issues. “Every year, the AAP government assured the people of Delhi that it would provide clean water and bring tap water to every household, but these claims proved to be hollow. The AAP government is doing politics and is accusing the Haryana government of releasing dirty water to Delhi,” Mr. Goel said.

“The Delhi government did not do any work to clean the water for five years and kept accusing others. Even after Delhi’s water sample failed BIS standards, the Kejriwal-led government did not take the issue seriously,” he added.

The MP further accused Mr. Kejriwal of forgetting his manifesto promise to clean the Yamuna. “The CM has not constituted a joint panel to deal with pollution or set up 14 treatment plants required for it... meanwhile, the air in Delhi has become so toxic that air purifiers have to be installed and people are drinking RO water,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-will-lose-polls-over-pollution-water-quality/article30570534.ece

184,2020/01/15,Each vote for BJP will be for inflation: AAP,"The Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday attacked the BJP over retail inflation, which is at a five-and-a-half year high, according to data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Monday.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia said: “Each vote for the BJP will be for costlier electricity, water, healthcare and there is clear evidence for these in the NSO figures that the BJP is responsible for rising inflation across India. It has now become a part of their politics, their governance model. Each vote for the BJP will be for inflation.”

He said that while high inflation under the BJP government is making it difficult for people to meet daily expenses, the AAP government’s policies are helping people to run households.

“Just as we prepare for elections, some very worrying figures on inflation have been released by NSO. They are worrying not just from the perspective of economic slowdown or unemployment, but most importantly because it has become difficult for the common man to meet even basic household expenses. This is the BJP’s gift to the people in the last six years with data clearly showing that inflation is at its highest in six years.”

He said that prices have been constantly rising since the BJP has come to power with inflation increasing from 2.1% to 7.4% in just one year and the prices of vegetables increasing by 60% across the nation in just one year.

“The abject failure of the BJP government in devising economic policy and their inability to contain inflation is breaking all records, especially in the last one year,” said Mr. Sisodia.

185,2020/01/15,"Protesters converge at Jantar Mantar, assert their identity","Hundreds of people gathered at Jantar Mantar to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) besides the “categorical mistreatment” of Muslim community at the hands of the police across the country.

The protesters said that the idea behind asserting their Muslim identity while registering dissent against the government is to challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remark that “those protesting can be identified by their clothes”.

Iqra Raza (20), a student of Delhi University, alleged that a policeman yelled “in burqa walon ko pakdo” at her during an anti-CAA protest. She said: “Policemen have constantly been using Islamphobic slurs while dealing with Muslim protesters, especially burqa-clad women, and that is extremely problematic. They justify their violence by saying that they have been ordered to disperse the crowd but who has ordered them to mistreat us who are dressed differently.”

Songs of resistance

The protesters raised slogans like “Ye desh humara aap ka, nahi kisi ke baap ka”, “Inquilab Zindabad” and “Aazadi”. Many of them also sang songs of resistance and read out poems as an ode to Muslim women who have been at the helm of anti-CAA protests.

Addressing the crowd, Aamir Aziz (30), an alumna of Jamia Millia Islamia, said: “Pluralism is the very essence of India and that is what we are trying to protect by protesting against CAA and NRC.”

The protesters alleged that a stark difference could be seen in the way the police have been ordered to treat Muslim protesters as compared to non-Muslims and raised questions regarding the “brutal crackdown” in Jamia and Aligarh.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/mub00c/article30570502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL15-JANTARMANTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/protesters-converge-at-jantar-mantar-assert-their-identity/article30570503.ece
186,2020/01/15,"Metro, railway staff to get postal ballot for first time","When the Capital’s residents cast their votes in the Delhi Assembly elections on February 8, several categories of electors may have already voted through postal ballots, with employees of the Delhi Metro and Northern Railway and mediapersons covering polling being extended the postal facility for the first time.

Also, in a first for Delhi, the postal ballot facility extended to senior citizens aged over 80 years and persons with disabilities (PwD) in the 2019 Jharkhand Assembly elections would be implemented in the national capital as well, as per a January 8 notification by the Election Commission of India.

The ECI, on January 10, notified those employed by the Delhi Metro and Northern Railway Transportation (passenger and freight) Services in Delhi as well as mediapersons who have been authorised to cover polling by the ECI as “essential services”.

These electors, “who on account of being on duty on the day of poll in the current general election to Legislative Assembly of NCT (National Capital Territory) of Delhi...will not be able to be present in their respective polling station”, will be allowed to vote by postal ballot, the notification said.

On January 10, the ECI wrote to the Chief Electoral Officer of Delhi to inform Delhi Metro and Northern Railway about the postal ballot facility and instruct them to nominate nodal officers for the same.

The ECI had on September 2, 2019, recommended to the Union Law and Justice Ministry to extend the postal ballot facility to absentee voters — electors who are unable to reach polling stations due to different degrees of disability, as well as those discharging essential services.

The Ministry had issued the relevant notification on October 22, 2019, after which postal ballots were given to those above 80 years and PwD in seven constituencies as a pilot in the Jharkhand polls in December.

187,2020/01/15,AAP campaign gets a head start with declaration of candidates,"With the Aam Aadmi Party releasing its full list of 70 candidates for the Delhi Assembly elections, the party’s campaign has got a head start over the Congress and the BJP which are yet to release their lists.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will fight the election from the New Delhi Assembly seat and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia from Patparganj, same as 2015 elections. In the last Assembly elections, AAP had registered a landslide victory by winning 67 of 70 seats.

“The tickets were allotted after surveys by the party in all constituencies,” AAP leader and Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said. Asked about protests by MLAs who have not got tickets, he told The Hindu, “This happens in all parties. AAP has calculated all these things while taking the decision. We will win with more majority this time.”

Mr. Gautam said that in his constituency, apart from the main issues in the manifesto, he will focus on decongesting footpaths and take measures to prevent drug addiction among youth.

AAP’s Timarpur MLA Pankaj Pushkar, who has been dropped, said he will continue to be with the party and campaign for it in the elections. “The party did not communicate to me earlier that I won't get a ticket. I have been consistent and honest and there was no negative feedback against me.”

Three of the seven AAP candidates who contested the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Delhi — Atishi, Dilip Pandey and Raghav Chadha — have been included in the list. Mr. Pandey has replaced Mr. Pushkar in Timarpur, Ms. Atishi replaced Avtar Singh in Kalkaji, and Mr. Chadha has been fielded in place of Vijendra Garg in Rajinder Nagar.

New faces

Among the leaders who joined AAP in the past one week, senior Congress leader Mahabal Mishra’s son Vinay Kumar Singh will fight from Dwarka, replacing sitting MLA Adarsh Shastri, five-time MLA Shoaib Iqbal will replace Asim Ahmad Khan in Matia Mahal and two-time MLA Ram Singh Netaji will replace Narayan Dutt Sharma in Badarpur.

Other MLAs who did not get a ticket are party’s chief whip in the Assembly Jagdeep Singh (Hari Nagar), Surender Singh (Delhi Cantt.), Haji Ishraq Khan (Seelampur), Ram Chander (Bawana), Sukhbir Singh Dalal (Mundka), Hazari Lal Chauhan (Patel Nagar). Also, Raju Dhingan (Trilokpuri), Manoj Kumar (Kondli), Choudhary Fateh Singh (Gokulpur) have been dropped.

“Thank you @ArvindKejriwal and AAP for expressing faith in me and giving me the opportunity to contest from Kalkaji. Am committed to putting AAP’s best foot forward and taking our govt’s stellar work to the people of Kalkaji,” Atishi said in a tweet.

Many AAP candidates also released videos on social media asking for votes. “For the first time election will be fought on work done, votes will be cast on work done... I have full confidence that we will once again elect Kejriwal government, because for Delhi Kejriwal is needed,” Mr. Chadha said in a video message.

The disease remains a threat to public health and is the top infectious cause of death globally.

In 2018, an estimated 10 million people developed TB and 1.5 million died of it while at least a million children become ill with it every year. Also about 5,00,000 new cases of multidrug 2 and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) are estimated to emerge annually but only one in three cases was reported by countries to have been diagnosed and treated in 2018.

WHO has noted that since the approval of Xpert MTB/RIF in 2010, significant additional evidence has been generated on its use as initial test for the diagnosis and rifampicin-resistant TB.

“In recent months new data on the use of Xpert and on the latest version TrueNat MTB and MTB Plus system have also become available.

The committee led by K.B. Ganesh Kumar, MLA, told the District Collector at its sitting held here on Monday that the administrative sanction for setting up additional hydrants at Aluva and Maradu supply points of the authority could be given by invoking relevant provisions under the Disaster Management Act. The committee would intervene to speed up the release of ₹80-lakh assistance for the project. The District Collector has been asked to implement the recommendation without delay.

The ‘Operation Pure Water initiative’ was launched after the committee came down heavily on private water tankers for collecting water from illegal sources like quarries at its sitting held here on December 5.

It had also directed the authorities to ensure that water was taken from the supply points and hydrants of KWA.

Mr. Ganesh Kumar said that there was no going back on the panel’s earlier decision that private water tankers should collect drinking water provided by the KWA alone and not draw water from any other sources.

The committee had suggested enhanced surveillance and surprise checks by officials representing the police, Regional Transport Office, Pollution Control Board, Food Safety and Health departments to ensure that tankers were supplying quality water to users.

The panel had suggested that separate arrangements had to be made for supplying water to hospitals and ships.

Token system would be introduced for supplying water to tankers. Stringent action would be taken against operators if they were supplying lesser quantity of water than what was assured to the consumer, the panel said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ensure-additional-hydrants-for-water-tankers-legislative-panel/article30570504.ece
195,2020/01/15,Municipality steps up efforts to allay fears of residents,"After residents in the vicinity of the demolished flats at Maradu complained of allergies and related health issues caused by dust from the implosion, the Maradu municipality has stepped up efforts to assuage their fears.

A medical camp was held near Alfa Serene on Tuesday by doctors and staff from the Nettoor Public Health Centre (PHC). “We have been suffering from sore throat and cold since we moved back after the demolition,” said Hannath K. K., who lives a few metres away from Alpha Serene. Jessy Raju near H2O Holy Faith had also faced breathing troubles and her existing skin allergies were exacerbated by the dust in her house, she said.

Dr. Geena Mohan from the PHC said that the ailments were minor. “Of the 55 patients we saw on Tuesday, most came with symptoms of dust allergy like sore throat, mild temperature, cold and, itching and skin allergies. They have been advised to keep their doors and windows closed and use a mask,” she said. “Their mental state also had to be taken into consideration,” she said. “They have remained tensed and in a state of shock for a while. While some of that has abated, they are still worried about the debris and how long the dust will take to clear.”

An awareness session was held near Jain Coral Cove by Dr. Rahul Antony Simon of a private hospital in the city. “Respiratory infections due to dust are common and people have been advised to report symptoms immediately, particularly if they already suffer from asthma. Long-term exposure to fine particles in dust could be harmful, but the humidity in the State means that the particles settle down faster and won’t remain suspended for long,” he said.

The two demolition agencies have begun separating steel from the rubble at H2O Holy Faith and Alpha Serene, said T.H. Nadeera, Maradu municipality chairperson. Another medical camp with a homoeopathic doctor will be held near H2O Holy Faith on Wednesday, she added. Residents around Holy Faith who had complained of official apathy in the aftermath of the demolition, have been pacified. “Water was sprayed before they began work on the debris on Tuesday, which helped with the dust,” said Ms. Raju.

But residents right behind Alpha Serene who had moved out before the demolition are apprehensive about moving back. “We had decided to live in a rented house in Nettoor for three months. The demolition agency has paid the rent in advance for three months. Considering the dust, there is no question of moving back soon,” said Antony N.J.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/2snd21/article30570497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14KI-MARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/municipality-steps-up-efforts-to-allay-fears-of-residents/article30570498.ece

The local BJP leaders have not issued any statement countering the allegation. The student of JU’s Sociology Department, Barsha Baral said in her complaint that last night around when she and her friend Arjun Kar, a musician-activist, were reaching their residence in Bikramgarh in Jadavpur, south Kolkata, a group of about 40 men associated with the BJP chased them.

“They surrounded us, addressed us as naxals and used most foul language. Soon, they started beating Arjun randomly, then they assaulted me. They hit us with heavy instruments,” Ms. Baral said in her complaint.

Ms. Baral is associated with All India Students’ Association (AISA), affiliated to Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML). Later local residents intervened and rescued Ms. Baral and Mr. Kar. Locals said that there was a meeting of BJP going on in the area at the time of the incident.

The participants identified Ms. Baral, who was in the forefront of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) movement in the area, and assaulted her, the locals said. The attackers were heard saying that they “would identify my residence and target later,” Ms Baral alleged. “I am feeling extremely scared and insecure,” Ms Baral wrote in her complaint. The police conducted a preliminary probe, no one is arrested.

This is the second incident of attack in Jadavpur area in recent weeks. Earlier a film maker Debalina Majumdar was targeted. Another film maker Ronny Sen was also attacked. The targeted people are associated with anti-CAA and anti-NRC movement in West Bengal.

IUML councillor C. Abdurahman pointed out that merchants had stocked a lot of single-use plastic products and hence they should be given a breathing period until the existing stock was cleared.

However, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran refused to give the merchants more chances after the expiry of the breathing period provided by the Kerala High Court up to January 20.

Independent councillor Mohammed Shameel said a lot of products claiming to be biodegradable plastic had found their way to the market and the Corporation should check if they were, in fact, biodegradable.

Corporation Secretary Binu Francis said those products with a QR code that could be scanned, a certificate from the Central or State Pollution Control Board or those with an ISO 17088 certification were to be considered biodegradable and hence excluded from confiscation. He said the Corporation machinery would be in full swing from Wednesday onwards to implement the plastic ban.

Besides the local bodies, the district administration and the Pollution Control Board are implementing the ban. Any violations were punishable by the imposition of a fine of ₹10,000 for the first time, ₹25,000 for the second time and ₹50,000 for the third time, said the Secretary.

S.M. Street work

The council’s decision to carry out several activities at S.M. Street with private participation drew flak from the Opposition councillors. IUML councillor Kunhamutti suggested that the activities be carried out directly by the Corporation, without private involvement. He criticised the poor state of lighting on the street barely a year after it was set up.

The Council has decided to ensure that the existing lights were functional, to provide new lights, set up a music system, carry out beautification wherever needed, construct toilets wherever necessary, make drinking water available for customers at the street and employ security personnel. The ideas will be finalised after consulting representatives of the merchant bodies.

The Council has also sanctioned ₹1.5 lakh to conduct soil investigation at the land at Kothi, where a modern slaughterhouse has been planned.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/dh4tmu/article30570048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14KIPLASTIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/corporation-all-set-to-implement-plastic-ban/article30570049.ece
198,2020/01/15,Varsity may not get new VC before March,"Calicut University is unlikely to get a new Vice-Chancellor (VC) before the end of this academic year. Though it’s been over a month since the Senate renominated Kerala State Planning Board vice chairman V.K. Ramachandran to a three-member panel that chooses the VC, it is not yet known if the selection process will be completed by March-end.

No list submitted

The previous search panel could not submit a list of applicants to Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, who is the Chancellor of universities, before its tenure ended on November 15.

Apart from Mr. Ramachandran, Chief Secretary Tom Jose, and Jawaharlal Nehru University Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar were its members.

While Mr. Jose was the Chancellor’s nominee, Mr. Kumar was recommended by the University Grants Commission (UGC). The Governor later decided to reconstitute the search panel and the university Senate on December 10 renominated Mr. Ramachandran, with a section of its members voting against him.

According to university sources, the tenure of the search panel is three months, and the previous panel’s term had been extended by another month. Normally, the Chief Secretary is the Chancellor’s nominee.

However, it remains to be seen who the UGC will pick. Last time, the panel had chosen five applicants for an interview scheduled at Thiruvananthapuram on November 12.

Interview cancelled

The interview was cancelled as Mr. Kumar could not attend it due to the student unrest on the JNU campus over fee hike. V. Anil Kumar, Vice-Chancellor of Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, is holding the additional charge as the tenure of the incumbent VC K. Mohammed Basheer ended on November 20.

Shortlisting candidates

Even after the UGC and the Chancellor name their nominees, it could take another three more months for the selection process to complete.

New applications will have to be called and an interview with shortlisted candidates will have to be held again, before submitting a shortlist to the Governor.

Teachers’ appointment

Meanwhile, the university has called for applications to appoint 116 teachers to its various departments.

The constitution of the Board of Studies and the appointment of Deans is pending too. The Congress-affiliated Calicut University Teachers’ Association recently sent a letter to the Chancellor to stop all proceedings until a permanent VC was appointed as they claimed that there was a chance of political interference by the ruling party.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/varsity-may-not-get-new-vc-before-march/article30570037.ece

200,2020/01/15,Anita Guha’s ‘Nandalala’ is an impressive dance drama,"Anita Guha of Bharathanjali directed and choreographed the spectacular multilingual and colourful presentation of the Nritya Natak, Nandalala, in the final day's performance at the 68th anniversary celebrations of Sri Sathguru Sangeetha Samajam.

It was a high-energy sequential representation of Krishna’s life, which started with an interesting invocation with songs in three languages — Vande arula vendum, Ra ra chinnana and Aayo Nandalala.

Lord Krishna’s life was so full that it would be impossible to recount it all in a single stroke. However, Anita tried some of the significant episodes.

It started off with Kamsa driving the chariot of Vasudeva and Devaki. Suddenly, a loud voice spoke from the skies, “Cruel Kamsa, the eighth child of Devakī will kill you one day.”

The presentation of all the guards mysteriously sleeping and jail doors opening on their own; Lord Vishnu appearing in the scene and Vasudeva placing the child in a basket on his head and walking across the river with a seven-hooded snake covering the child, were well portrayed by the dancers.

The Kalinga Narthana episode, set in melodious tunes, and orchestration for the fight and the victory dance on the snake’s five hoods were other well-developed scenes.

Lord Indra asking for forgiveness and Krishna performing a miracle by lifting the Govardhana mountain on his little finger as an umbrella and giving shelter to everyone were musically explained well with expressions.

The episode of Rasalila and the subsequent wrestling were head turners and the episodes were explained well in the compering to bring out the deep meaning: how God takes care of each of his devotees personally.

The dance drama ended with the killing of the evil king. The performance was characterised by excellent footwork and coordination among the dancers.

The troupe accomplished the difficult task of making the audience follow the story through crafty 'nrithyam.' The agility of the 15 artistes playing multiple roles was very impressive.

Some of the experts, who contributed to the performance include Revathy Sankaran (English narration); P. R. Venkatasubramanian (music); Neyveli Santhanagopalan (Tamil lyrics and music); Dandibotla Narayana Moorthy (Telugu lyrics); O. S. Arun, Sriranjini Santhanagopalan, Chinmaya Uma, Vignesh Iswar and R. P. Shravan (vocal); MVN Murthy (Kuchipudi guidance); Lakshmi Kannan (Kathak guidance) and Murugan (lighting design).

201,2020/01/15,‘Koorai poo’: a much sought-after flower during Pongal,"On Tuesday, the city streets were flooded with vendors selling the humble koorai poo, which is an important part of Pongal festival. This flower, which is ubiquitous during the Tamil month of Thai, is considered to be auspicious.

Ideally, a bundle consisting of aavaaram poo, koorai poo, mango leaves and neem leaves, is tied in front of houses on the day of Pongal. “This is a propitious ritual that is being followed through many generations. This is part of the festival and it brings hope that the upcoming year will be prosperous for farmers,” said N. Andi, a farmer from Maanikkampatti near Melur.

Koorai poo blooms only during Thai. “The flower is usually sought after only during Pongal festival,” said A. Thennarasi, a vendor hailing from Karungalakudi.

The flowers are usually found across farmlands outside the core city, after the rainy season. “It is an uphill task for us to pluck koorai poo amid thorny bushes. It is even more tough to spot the aavaram poo, which is an important component of the bundle,” she added.

On Tuesday, a bundle was sold between ₹5 and ₹10. “The buyers do not understand the struggle that we undergo in plucking and collecting the flowers. I was disheartened when people asked four bundles for ₹10,” said A. Chellaatha, a vendor.

But, irrespective of the price, every family purchases at least one bundle as part of the ritual, said R. Geethavandhini, a resident of K. Pudur.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/lbq9hn/article30570812.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15-KOORAIPOO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/koorai-poo-a-much-sought-after-flower-during-pongal/article30570813.ece
202,2020/01/15,"Brisk sale of turmeric, flowers and sugarcane across markets in Madurai","Festive spirit pervaded the city on Tuesday, a day before Pongal festival, as markets across the city witnessed brisk sales of flowers, sugarcane and turmeric.

While customers said that sugarcane and turmeric were sold at a reasonable rate, they complained about the increase in prices of flowers.

While a bundle of 15 sugarcanes were sold at around ₹600 to the buyers, a pair of sugarcane was sold as high as ₹100.

Vendors were selling a pair of turmeric for ₹10, ₹20 and ₹30, depending on its quality.

Although arrival of turmeric was good due to better yield following copious rainfall, the profits were thin in the retail market, complained S. Jayakumar, a farmer from Ayyur village near Alanganallur.

“Usually, one truckload consisting of 3,000 bundles of turmeric was sold between ₹20,000 and ₹25,000. But this year, we were able to sell one truckload for only around ₹17,000,” the farmer rued.

In Madurai district, turmeric is grown in a few villagers at Alanganallur block.

“We raise turmeric mainly for Pongal festival and we harvest when the crop is around eight months old. So, we are forced to sell turmeric even at lower profit margins, as we have to sell all our stock during the festival,” said M. Vasanth, another turmeric farmer.

Concurring with their view, D. Manivannan, a commission agent selling sugarcane, said that despite higher yield the profit margin was lower for retailers and farmers. “The money circulation has reduced and, hence, we also cannot increase prices,” he said.

However, the prices of flowers soared up at the flower market in Mattuthavani ahead of Pongal festival. While one kg of jasmine was sold at ₹3,000 in the morning, the price came down to ₹2,000 by evening.

S. Ramachandran, president, Mattuthavani Flower Market Vendors’ Association, said that the prices of flowers were usually high during the month of January. “This period is off-season because of less producation due to chill weather,” he said.

Sevvandhi, a flower which is used mainly during the festival, was sold at ₹120 a kg on Tuesday.

“Four days ago, the flower was sold at ₹80 a kg. Vendors have raised the prices to make the most of the festival rush,” said M.A. Doulath Basha, a vendor.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/kxv60o/article30570861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA15-TURMERICPONGAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/brisk-sale-of-turmeric-flowers-and-sugarcane-across-markets-in-madurai/article30570862.ece

Residents of the area, who have watched jallikattu for years now, say they are looking forward to hosting people from different parts of the world to see Tamil Nadu’s traditional sport.

N. Rasathi, one of the residents of Avaniapuram who actively took part in the 2017 protests calling to lift the ban on the sport, said that houses tomorrow will be cooking in bulk to ensure that guests do not go hungry. “We will be sharing our roof with spectators and relatives to ensure they can watch the action at a close distance,” she said. Other residents were busy spreading coir in the arena and fixing coconut stumps painted white and red at the vadivasal - the entry point of the bulls.

Organised by Taj Cycles and Fitness, Kankanady supported by Kross Bikes, the treasure hunt intended to test riders’ knowledge about the city. There was no bar on seeking help from anyone to crack clues; the only restriction was on using mobile phones while riding. Participants had to click selfies of the team in front of the landmark and send them to organisers. Participants also had to crack two surprise clues that they get while on the go. The 12 plus three clues were sent on WhatsApp to each team in a jumbled order so that everyone should not rush at the same direction.

The clues were quite interesting. St. Agnes College was the answer for “We have mentored many girls into responsible young women. We are celebrating our centenary year in education.”

Another was about the golden jubilee building of the ‘30’ brand beedies; but some participants missed the rider of taking a selfie in front of a showroom next to that building on Kadri Road.

Another clue was the hotel established in 1926 at city’s first traffic signal (Taj Mahal-Hampanakatte); first outlet serving Gad Bad ice cream (Ideal-Hampanakatte); heritage college building (University College); renovated time centre (Clock Tower); institute surveying physical structure and substance of Earth (Geological Survey of India); organisation founded by Swami Vivekananda (Ramakrishna Mutt); temple that gave Mangaluru its name (Mangaladevi); hospital established in 1880 (Fr. Mullers) etc.

Contestants were asked to click selfies with a lungi clad man and sitting on hair cutting saloon’s chair.

Sarvesh Samaga and Ashok Nitin Lobo emerged winners, followed by Joana-Sharan and Shivanand Rao-Shubhanand Rao. P.N. Ramraj-Sapna Ramraj got the couple team prize; Anil-Aashutosh parent-child team and Joseph Periera-Dony Menezes 50-plus team.

Vishwaprasanna Tirtha Swami said that if the leaders of both the communities strived together, then the mistrust between them would gradually go. If there were communal clashes, efforts should be made to understand the reason behind them, he said.

“We should not just take a communal stand. We should see who was behind it and who were the wrong doers? We should not allow the health of society to be disturbed. Both the communities should take a decision in this regard. Then, the mistrust will go. Or, there will be problems,” the seer said.

It is customary for devotees in Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts to offer foodgrains and vegetables for the Paryaya Mutt to ensure its plentiful supply to the 800-year-old Sri Krishna Mutt/Temple here so that the large number of devotees could be feed during the Paryaya festival and after.

As the biennial Paryaya festival has become popular, devotees from other districts and places too have been contributing for the Hore Kanike. Normally, the Hore Kanike procession is held daily for a few days before the Paryaya festival.

But this time, the Admar Mutt has decided to have the Hore Kanike from devotees each fortnight after the first procession on Wednesday. The intention is that it ensures that the foodgrains and vegetables do not go waste if they were all brought and given at once over a period of a week. Hence, it would be spread over the entire Paryaya period.

Ishapriya Tirtha Swami, junior seer of Admar Mutt, who will be ascending the Paryaya Peetha here on January 18, will launch the Hore Kanike procession at the Malpe port here at 3 p.m.

According to Shreyas K.M., Deputy Director, DRI, Mangaluru, the seizure was made in the old airport in Bajpe due to the coordinated effort by the DRI officials from Mangaluru and Bengaluru. The modus operandi of smuggling gold was unique, he said in a release here on Tuesday.

The smuggled gold was concealed in five metal sprockets which were imported by Swaroop Mineral Pvt. Ltd. of Udupi in the name of “mining conveyor drive chain”. The gold was deftly concealed inside the heavy metal sprockets by way of a groove.

On physical examination, it gave only slight hint that it had been tampered with. The scanning of these wheels added to the suspicion and finally, the officers could retrieve the gold with the help of a local mechanic and a lathe operator at Bajpe. On examination by an authorised jeweller, the net weight of the round plates was 4,995 grams after discounting the weight of aluminium coating. The gold pieces were found to be of 24 Karat purity. A director of Swaroop Mineral Resources Manohar Kumar Poojari, who was involved in the case, was arrested in Bengaluru the same day.

211,2020/01/15,Journal 'Nature' denounces violence inside university campuses,"In an editorial published on January 14, 2020, the journal Nature has said that the “government and state authorities must step in and stop violent attacks on academic campuses”. The comment comes in the wake of the January 5 violent attacks on students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Delhi.

This is the first time a scientific journal has denounced the violent attacks on students protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Soon after the government diluted Article 370 in Kashmir, The Lancet had written an editorial underlining the deaths and gross human rights violations by security forces and armed groups, and mental health crisis in Kashmir due to prolonged “instability”.

Nature says: “Some of the peaceful protests are being met with violence, and university campuses are not immune… On the evening of 5 January, people wearing masks and carrying iron rods, stones and wooden clubs entered the campus and launched an attack.” Citing Human Rights Watch, the journal specifically mentions that Delhi police “failed to provide protection” to the students who were being attacked. On January 5 evening, a mob of 50-100 unleashed violence on both students and a few professors of the institute for nearly three hours.

Nature also mentions the attack on students inside the campuses of Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi and Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh.

Saying that supporters of the government are upset at students and academics who are opposing the CAA, the journal says: “They must know that freedom of expression is core to a university’s mission; that the ability of citizens to protest peacefully against government policies is a right, not a privilege; and that the state should provide protection for such dissent.” It then adds: “Without it, no opposition would be able to present its case to the public — as members of the current government and its supporters did in the years they were out of power.”

Saying that academics inside and outside India are justified in speaking up against violence inside campuses that is causing fear, the journal says: “India’s authorities must take the necessary steps to protect their nation’s universities and their people’s freedom of speech.”

The editorial ends by quoting Principal Scientific Adviser Prof. K. VijayaRaghavan: “Campuses are places for learning, discussion, collegial debate amongst diverse opinions, and research. There is no place at all for violence.”",science,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/facwdf/article30487416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06JNU1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/journal-nature-denounces-violence-inside-university-campuses/article30572975.ece

He was speaking at the company’s two-day ‘Smbhav’ event for small and medium businesses that kicked off on Wednesday in the national capital. Mr. Bezos last visited India in 2014, when he had announced an investment of USD 2 billion in the country. Later in 2016, he committed an investment of USD 3 billion in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, taking the total investment committed to India to USD 5 billion.

“We are making this announcement now because it is working. We have been doing this... When something works you should double down on it. And that is why we are doing it,” he added.

In a fireside chat Amit Agarwal, Senior Vice President and Country Head, Amazon India, Mr .Bezos said that the 21st century will belong to India. “I want to make a prediction for India. I predict that the 21st century is going to be the Indian century. The dynamism, energy... Everywhere I go there are people interested in self improvement, in growth. This country has something special and it's a democracy. This is going to be the Indian century.”

He further added that in the 21st century, the most important alliance is going to be the alliance between India and the US -- the world's oldest democracy and the world's largest democracy.

Asked what would he be, in case his bet on Amazon hadn’t worked out, Mr. Bezos said, “extremely happy software programmer somewhere.""

Trader Protests

Mr. Bezos visit to India has been marred by controversy due various protests planned by Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). The visit also follows India’s competition watchdog CCI initiating a probe against Amazon as well as Walmart-owned Flipkart over their discounting practices and exclusive brand launches.

In a press statement, CAIT said that “strong protests” were carried across 300 cities in the county by about 5 lakh traders against Amazon chief Jeff Bezos. It alleged that the current model of Amazon and Flipkart involving predatory pricing and deep discounting has created distortionary effects by driving out the traders from the market.
