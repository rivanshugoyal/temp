0,2020/02/09,"Chiefs of boards, corporations to be named after Budget session","In an effort to placate disappointed ministerial aspirants, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Sunday said appointments to various State-run boards and corporations would be made after the Budget session of the State legislature.

Several BJP MLAs, especially the old-timers, are disappointed over not being made Ministers in the recent expansion of the Cabinet. While a handful of them are still hopeful of getting ministerial berths during the next expansion, several others feel that their chances of getting a berth are limited as a large number of party-hopper MLAs who won in the recent bypolls have been accommodated in the Cabinet.

Mr. Yediyurappa’s statement regarding appointments to boards and corporations is being seen as an attempt to keep the hopes alive for such MLAs. The Budget session is scheduled to commence on March 5.

The Chief Minister told reporters in his hometown of Shikaripur on Sunday that Umesh Katti, Hukkeri MLA, would be inducted into his Ministry shortly while other senior MLAs would be offered suitable responsibilities in the coming days.

He said, “Though Mr. Katti was eligible to become a Minister on the merit of seniority, he could not be accommodated in the Cabinet owing to political inevitability.”

Regarding Araga Jnanendra, four-time MLA for Thirthahalli who had expressed his displeasure in the past over denial of a Cabinet berth, he said there were many senior and deserving MLAs like Mr. Jnanendra who could not be made Ministers as it was inevitable to offer ministerial positions to those who won in the bypolls. Senior leaders would be offered other responsibilities in the coming days, he said.

‘No differences’

Denying that the recent expansion of the State Cabinet had triggered discontent among senior MLAs, he said there were no differences between senior MLAs and the newcomers to the BJP and that the seniors were aware of the political inevitability that lead to the induction of the newcomers into the Ministry.

He said that as announced earlier, portfolios would be allocated to the newly inducted Ministers on Monday.

On the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Karnataka, he said his government would abide by the directions of the Centre over the issue.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fs3lwc/article30777733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10BGBSYPC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/chiefs-of-boards-corporations-to-be-named-after-budget-session/article30777734.ece

Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao, in a tweet, said, “Another tragic loss of life in the line of duty, Traffic Head constable Dhananjaya died and Constable Uma Maheshwara severely injured after a speeding car hits them on international airport flyover while checking overspeeding vehicles; a family devastated; I have no words to console.”

Sara Fathima, DCP, North (Traffic), said the accused has been identified as Kushal Raj (31). “The vehicle was going fast, hit another car, and then hit the constables. The vehicle has been seized,” she said.

3,2020/02/09,BBMP to renegotiate MoU terms with institute for tree census,"The tree census in the city that was set to begin three months ago is yet to take off even though the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Institute of Wood Science and Technology for the exercise.

The MoU states that only trees in public spaces will be enumerated. The High Court, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition on the subject, had taken objection to this and directed the BBMP to also enumerate trees on private land. The next hearing is scheduled for February 11.

Complying with the High Court directive, the BBMP has now written to the institute seeking to renegotiate the MoU to include enumeration of all trees in the city.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said there were practical difficulties in enumerating trees on private land. “Most of the apartment complexes and the owners of private land do not allow enumerators in. We are exploring whether we can get citizens to self-declare the trees on their land through a mobile app,” he said.

The Commissioner said that Chapter IV of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976, which lists out duties of the Tree Authority, states, “Carrying out a census of the existing trees and obtaining, whenever considered necessary, declarations from all owners or occupants about the number of trees in their land”.

Tree conservation activists, however, have argued that this is not feasible. “During a tree census, details such as a photo of the tree, its species, height and girth, and the health of the tree have to be docked into an app, which requires technical knowledge and the common man cannot do it,” said tree conservationist Vijay Nishant, who spearheads a private tree census initiative, Vruksha.

Private individuals will have to let government representatives in to enumerate trees just like they cooperate with the population census.

Mr. Nishant said the civic body and the institute should ideally carry out a pilot project in one of the wards in the city to understand the various issues that may crop up, device standard protocols and scale it up across the city.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ylaq0n/article29999573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGCENSUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-to-renegotiate-mou-terms-with-institute-for-tree-census/article30773142.ece
4,2020/02/09,Techie feared drowned in Kalkere,"A 30-year-old software engineer is feared drowned in Kalkere lake near Ramamurthynagar after the coracle he had taken out into the lake capsized on Friday night.

According to the police, Sachin and his friend Ullas, after partying that night, decided to venture into the lake. “They managed to hoodwink and slip passed the security guard and took charge of the coracle. However, it was not stable, and did not have a paddle,” a police officer said on Saturday. They used their hands to paddle to the middle of the lake, where Sachin lost his balance and fell. The coracle capsized and Ullas also fell into the water.

“Ullas managed to swim to the shore, but there was no sign of Sachin. He immediately alerted security guard Rajesh Irappa, who, in turn, alerted the fire control room,” the officer added.

The police, with the help of Fire Services officials and search and rescue personnel from the National Disaster Response Force and civil defence staff launched a search operation for Sachin. It was called off at 6 p.m., but will resume on Sunday morning. The Ramamurthynagar police have detained Ullas for questioning.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/techie-feared-drowned-in-kalkere/article30773087.ece
5,2020/02/09,Alliance varsity refutes students’ charges,"Responding to allegations by students of harassment, including those of sexual harassment by female students, Alliance University has said that it “upholds highest academic quality and student well-being”.

Students of Alliance University had written to the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister claiming that the administration of the university has been affected and that they are being harassed by people close to the management.

In a statement, the university said its operations remain “unaffected” and that the recent controversy had no bearing on the effective functioning of the university.

“The ‘Women Empowerment Cell’ and the ‘Student Grievance Cell’ at the university have not received any complaint of sexual harassment, and adherence to Acts such as POSH [prevention of sexual harassment at workplace] is upheld at the University. Every student’s safety is of paramount importance and to facilitate the same, halls of residence have 24X7 security,” the university stated.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/alliance-varsity-refutes-students-charges/article30772891.ece
6,2020/02/09,Unified platform to register plaints with multiple agencies,"Be it pothole-ridden roads or leaking sewage, broken street lights or BMTC buses not stopping at the designated spot, citizens can now register and track all such grievances with a click of a button instead of contacting an individual agency.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Saturday launched the ‘Namma Bengaluru’ web application, a one-stop platform that can be downloaded as an app on mobile phones or accessed on desktops.

Developed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), it will act as a single-window interface with as many as seven government agencies, including Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Ltd. (Bescom), Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB), Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL), Bangalore Development Authority (BDA), Bengaluru Metropolitain Region Development Authority (BMRDA), and Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC).

Citizens can register their grievances through texts, and also by uploading photos and videos and updating their location through the geocoding service.

Basavaraju S., Special Commissioner (Revenue and IT), said that the platform would be improved once officers and citizens start using it.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said that Namma Bengaluru was developed with the support and coordination of all the agencies. “We will ensure that grievances reach the right agency on time and the registered complaints are solved in a time-bound manner,” he said.

The app can be downloaded through bbmp.gov.in. or https://nammabengaluru.org.in/login

However, many citizens expressed their reservations about the efficacy of the platform given that the BBMP’s Sahaya app failed to live up to its name. Poor interface and complaints being closed before they were solved were some of the problems.

Updated Sahaya app

The glitch-ridden Sahaya app, however, has been updated, and its new avatar was launched on Saturday by the Chief Minister. In Sahaya 2.0, back office, staff app, citizen app, and grievance dashboard are all connected to the cloud server. The app can be accessed through the Namma Bengaluru platform.

“The redesigned module has provisions for automatic assignment and automatic escalation of complaints to higher authorities,” Mr. Basavaraju said.

Civic officials promised that problems would not be closed without or before they are addressed.

Mechanical sweepers

The BBMP received 15 mechanical sweepers and six ambulances on Saturday. Mayor M. Goutham Kumar said the mechanical sweepers can clean up to 40 km of roads a day.

“The machines will be used to clean high-density corridors, arterial and sub-arterial roads, and the central business district. This will also help us in reducing dust and score more in Swachh Survekshan,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/okme1y/article30772837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGAMBULENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/unified-platform-to-register-plaints-with-multiple-agencies/article30772839.ece
7,2020/02/09,"Protests against CAA, NRC continue","Protests against the the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens (NRC), and National Population Register (NPR) continued in the city on Saturday as well, with several well-known names lending their support, while working professionals took time out to register their protest.

Freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy, who has been leading a protest by the Citizens’ Rights Action Committee, a group of individuals and organisations, was joined by historian Ramachandra Guha at Freedom Park on Saturday. “[Narendra] Modi and [Amit] Shah are trying to divert our attention so that they don’t have to speak about the plight of farmers, jobs, and the economy,” Mr. Doreswamy said.

Mr. Guha said it was important for political parties to come out. “Students are over-represented and the Congress is under- represented. But regardless of political parties, the important thing about this movement is that it has brought the young and the old together, Hindus and Muslims together, men and women together. The participation of women and students has been amazing, and you can see the difference between pro-CAA and anti-CAA protests.”

Candlelight vigil

On Bannerghatta Road, working professionals turned up to voice their angst in a candlelight vigil organised by Naavu Bharathiyaru.

Syed Tousif, a businessman, said, “People from all walks of life are participating in this protest because we want the government to withdraw the NPR as it is the base to implement the NRC. We are fighting it legally also. More people are becoming aware of why we do not need the CAA, the NRC, and the NPR, and workshops and meets are being held in multiple locations. This is not just a Muslim issue; it is of migrant workers, adivasis, and women. We have seen what happened in the Assam NRC exercise where some members of the same family were included and some others left out.” They also expressed anger at the sedition case filed in the Bidar Shaheen School incident.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/amyniq/article30772754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/protests-against-caa-nrc-continue/article30772755.ece
8,2020/02/09,"Bengaluru’s suburban railway project needs ₹1,000 crore to take off","The ₹18,600-crore suburban rail network project will need an initial investment of ₹1,000 crore to take off in the coming financial year.

Chief of the Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE) Amit Garg on Saturday said that international financial agencies such as JICA, ADB, and the World Bank had shown interest in the project. He estimated that investment would be increased in the coming financial years (2021–22 and 2022–23) by 15% and then 20% of the project cost.

“We have approached various financial agencies that have shown interest in investing in the suburban rail project. In the first year, there is a plan to invest 5% of the project cost and 50% of the land cost. The suburban rail network requires 600 acres of land, of which 100 acres of land belongs to private parties. As about 85% of the land is available, acquisition will not be a problem,” said Mr. Garg. Once civil work gets completed, K-RIDE would explore the possibility of roping in private players to operate trains on a long-term lease basis, said Mr. Garg.

Mr. Garg was speaking on the sidelines of a videoconference by MoS for Railways Suresh Angadi, who inaugurated the newly electrified section of Chunar–Chopan in Uttar Pradesh on Saturday.

“The financial rate of returns in the suburban rail project is around 11. All measures have been taken to make the project financially viable,” he added. The agency hopes to generate additional revenue through value capture finance (VCF) which will see areas around stations and the rail network develop.

K-RIDE is open to the idea of innovative finance where private companies come forward to build the suburban rail stations on the lines of Namma Metro. Already, as part of the KSR (Bengaluru) railway station – Devanahalli line, Bangalore International Airport Ltd. is building a railway station near the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA). According to Mr. Garg, once the suburban rail network connects the city to the airport, 4 lakh passengers would benefit daily.

To implement the 148-km suburban rail network with 57 stations, the Union and the State governments will provide 20% of equity each. The Union government will facilitate external assistance up to 60% of the project cost, which is estimated at ₹18,600 crore.

No time frame fixed

After drawing flak for allocating a mere ₹1 crore for the suburban rail project in the pink book that was issued on Wednesday, Mr. Angadi on Saturday said the Union Cabinet would approve the project in due course. When asked about any time frame fixed for the Cabinet approval, the Minister said, “Why are you having doubts ? Every week Cabinet meetings are held. There is a process to take up the issue.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/msb9pa/article30772743.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08BGSUBURBANRAILWAYSERVICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/citys-suburban-railway-project-needs-1000-crore-to-take-off/article30772744.ece

11,2020/02/09,DVAC conducts searches in equipment procurement scam,"Officers of the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) on Saturday conducted searches at more than 15 places, including the residence of senior police officer M. Anbuchezhian, in connection with alleged irregularities in the procurement of equipment for the police force.

Twelve teams of the DVAC had fanned out for searches across the State. The searches were held on Saturday morning at the houses of Mr. Anbuchezhian in Kilpauk, Additional Superintendent of Police Ramesh and Deputy Superintendent of Police Udayashankar in Pattinapakkam.

Following allegations by political parties including DMK and PMK, the Home Department had initially ordered an internal probe against the police officers for ‘criminal misconduct’ and causing ‘pecuniary loss’ to the government on September 19 last year.

Subsequently, a preliminary internal investigation by the Deputy Inspector General (Technical Services) and Inspector General (Crime) allegedly found serious irregularities in the tenders floated for the purchase of CCTV cameras as well as the eligibility criteria set for the procurement of these products, among other issues.

“The DVAC conducted a detailed enquiry on the orders of government into the allegation that the then Superintendent of Police, Technical Services and Police Telecommunication Branch officals committed irregularities in the purchase of technical gadgets such as mobiles, CCTV devices, tablet PCs, GPS and spare batteries for VHF sets during the period 2016-2018, thereby gaining pecuniary advantage and causing a huge monetary loss to the government,” sources said.

18 places searched

“As the detailed enquiry reveals a prima facie case against 14 officials of Police Telecommunication Branch and two private firms, a case was registered on Friday. Subsequently, DVAC officers conducted searches in 18 places including residences and offices of the suspected officers and private individuals. Some incriminating material and documents have been seized from there,” the sources added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/61zs18/article30769309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08FEBTH-DVACSearchjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dvac-conducts-searches-in-equipment-procurement-scam/article30772948.ece
12,2020/02/09,Director’s complaint condemned,"Tamil Film Distributors’ Federation president T. Rajendar criticised film-maker A.R. Murugadoss, who directed Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar, for filing a police complaint against distributors who tried to meet him recently at his residence, merely to present a petition seeking compensation after suffering huge losses.

He said that distributors of Darbar, who bought the film at a huge price and suffered losses, approached the distributors’ body and urged the body to intervene.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Rajendar said that distributors had presented a petition, stating that they had suffered losses while distributing Darbar.

“We have told them that if they have bought the film for ‘MG (Minimum Guarantee)’, they cannot approach the courts, but the issue can be taken up on the basis of ethics and tradition, that they have suffered losses by paying a huge amount,” said Mr. Rajendar.

Mr. Rajendar said that the affected distributors claimed that Lyca Productions had asked them to approach Mr. Murugadoss with their petition for compensation.

He condemned Mr. Murugadoss for filing a police complaint against the distributors for trying to meet him. Mr. Rajendar said, “Did they come armed? Did they come in the midnight? Did they wear face masks? Did they come with henchmen? Did they come with sickles and guns with bullets?”

Mr. Murugadoss could have met them and explained his point of view, he added.“If the distributors are lying about the collections, lets look at the numbers. The production company has not given the agreement after taking the money. Why?” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/directors-complaint-condemned/article30772946.ece

14,2020/02/09,2 IMH patients make a home of their own,"In a first for the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), two of its residents who recovered with treatment have moved into a rented house in the city. The duo is among a handful of inmates who are employed, and will now begin a new journey in their lives outside the IMH campus.

It does not stop with treatment and recovery for persons with mental illnesses.

Psychosocial rehabilitation and integration into the community are equally or more important.

IMH, in the last several years, has reunited many of its patients with their families, but this is the first time that two of its inmates are making a home of their own and becoming independent.

Sathish* and Praveen* are among 10 residents of IMH who are currently employed. One of them works at the Directorate of Medial and Rural Health Services, while the other is engaged as a security guard, P. Poorna Chandrika, director of IMH, said. On Saturday, a group of doctors and staff of IMH visited their home.

“Some of the inmates who are employed face hardships while explaining that they live in IMH. The government’s plan to establish a half-way home will take two years for completion. Some of these residents showed interest in going out of the campus. With the help of an NGO (Better Chances) engaged in art therapy with our patients, they have found a home to rent and have moved out of the campus,” she said.

Keeping an eye

The duo will share the rent from their salaries every month, she said, adding: “They will have to report to IMH once a week. Our social workers will visit the house regularly, and our staff, who reside close by, will also drop in. The houseowner was understanding, and we hope that more persons come forward to provide houses for persons who have had mental illnesses and have improved with treatment.”

Porkodi Palaniappan, founder, Better Chances, said it was not just about equipping persons with mental illnesses to move into the community, but also enabling the community to accept and include them without discrimination.

“Somehow, building inclusive communities within urban settings has always been a challenge, but we have been breaking barriers with our work in such communities. We have been educating the community, that they cannot discriminate,” she added.

She pooled in funds with support from her batchmates of CSI Bain Matriculation Higher Secondary School to pay the advance amount and provide household essentials for the duo.

15,2020/02/09,‘Economic empowerment of women will boost growth’,"Women are emerging as the drivers of the nation’s economic growth and their economic empowerment is essential to boost national development, Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan said on Saturday.

Addressing a gathering of mostly women from the southern States at the Working Women’s Forum (WWF), she said women in the informal sector were hardworking. “I have come here as your sister, to gain positive energy from women like you, who work in challenging environments,” she said.

Highlighting government schemes to provide loans to women, she said, “Women must give as much importance to health and sanitation, as economic independence. You must count calories, as much as you count currency”. She also lauded the contributions of late Jaya Arunachalam, founder of WWF, in pioneering the self-help group movement in India.

She gave away Regional Excellence Awards for Best Women’s Cooperative in south India. While the women’s cooperative from the Chennai branch was chosen for the overall Championship Award, women’s cooperatives in the Adiramapattinam branch in Tamil Nadu, Hyderabad branch in Telangana, Bellary branch in Karnataka and Bhimavaram branch in Andhra Pradesh bagged regional awards.

N. Ravi, chairperson, Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Chennai, said Jaya Arunachalam had touched the lives of over six lakh women in the four southern States, through WWF, that was established 40 years ago. The movement was based on the two pillars of trust and self-confidence, he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/to10ga/article30772920.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9THTAMILISAI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/economic-empowerment-of-women-will-boost-growth/article30772921.ece
16,2020/02/09,‘India-Japan ties have been extremely strong for decades’,"For decades now, political ties have been extremely strong between India and Japan, except for a brief period, N. Ravi, publisher of The Hindu Group, said on Saturday.

While speaking at the Japan-India relations and Indo-Pacific Cooperation 2020 event, he said cultural ties and people-to-people ties had always remained vibrant.

“In terms of the state of the ties, it has moved from what was described as global partnership in 2000 between India and Japan to global and strategic partnership in 2006, and in 2014, elevated to special strategic and global partnership. It was a change not just in nomenclature, but also reflected the depth and action-based cooperation that has developed between the two nations,” he added.

M.K. Narayanan, former National Security Advisor, Government of India, and former Governor of West Bengal, said today, India and Japan were on the same wavelength, and this was made possible only because of the pioneering efforts of various leaders from both sides.

“The main thrust of the Indo-Japanese coordination in the Indian Ocean region centres around expanding maritime diplomacy, accompanied by specific steps to implement directives provided from time-to-time,” he said.

Sridhar Krishnaswamy, deputy dean and professor of department of journalism at the SRM Institute of Science and Technology, and T.P.

18,2020/02/09,CMRL terminates contract over delay,"Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has terminated the contract of IL&FS Transportation Networks Limited (ITNL) for the Phase I extension project, owing to delay in the completion of construction.

In the 9-km Phase I extension project, running from Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar, the stretch between Washermanpet and Korukkupet will run underground, followed by an elevated stretch up to Wimco Nagar.

ITNL, a part of the IL&FS Group, had got a contract of nearly ₹370 crore to build two underground stations at Sir Theagaraya College and Korukkupet.

According to CMRL officials, they were left with no choice but to terminate the contract because they were displeased with the poor pace of construction. “Usually, we try to do everything possible to help the firm finish the work. We terminate contracts only if there is no other option. They [ITNL] struggled with severe cash crunch for several months and the progress of work was poor. Hence, we decided to end the contract recently,” an official said.

In place of ITNL, two contractors who are already executing other works for CMRL have been roped in and have already started finishing the remaining work, as the plan is to get the stretch operational by June.

Officials said that the work would now be finshed on time. “We will shortly call for tenders to carry out interior works,” an official said.

The ITNL management declined to comment on the issue. It can be recalled that CMRL had terminated the contract of Gammon India and CCCL in the Phase I project after they failed to meet deadlines.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wcsco2/article30772905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/8THCMRL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cmrl-terminates-contract-over-delay/article30772906.ece
19,2020/02/09,National Senior Hockey | Haryana beats Sports Authority of India to win title,"In the end, the final turned out to be anti-climactic and one-sided as Haryana lived up to the favourite’s tag and trounced Sports Authority of India (SAI) 6-0 to win the title in the 10th National Senior Hockey (A division) championship here on Sunday.

There were no more comebacks for the young SAI side which ran out of steam after a promising start. SAI dominated the first quarter during which it earned three penalty corners. But SAI’s penalty corner conversions left a lot to be desired as Haryana survived.

It was a different Haryana side which took the field in the second quarter. The former champion shrugged off its defensive approach and played with lot of verve and aggression in the midfield, much to the discomfort of the SAI defence.

Haryana went ahead in the 19th minute. Annu, after receiving the pass from right, sold her marker a dummy and pushed the ball towards an unmarked Manisha, who scored. Poonam Rani did the spadework for the second goal with an excellent pass which was deflected in by Annu in the 22nd minute.

SAI managed to keep a clean sheet in the third quarter despite being at the receiving end of Haryana’s attack. However, Haryana stamped its class by scoring four goals in the last quarter. Kajal struck a field goal in the 47th minute and Deepika made amends for her earlier misses by scoring the fourth goal in the 50th minute. Haryana scored twice again through Usha (59) and Deepika Sen (60). The latter converted a penalty corner in the dying minutes.

Madhya Pradesh Hockey Academy finished third after defeating Maharashtra 2-1 in the loser’s final.

After a cagey start, the tournament’s top scorer Rutuja Pisal scored her 10th goal to put Maharashtra ahead in the 25th minute. However MPHA struck twice in space of two minutes through Jyoti Pal (31) and Sadhana Senger (33) to turn the contest on its head.

The results: Final: Haryana 6 (Manisha 19, Annu 22, Kajal 47, Deepika 50, Usha 59, Devika Sen 60) bt SAI 0.

20,2020/02/09,FIH Hockey Pro League | Harmanpreet’s error costs India dear against Belgium,"India fought hard but a defensive lapse from Harmanpreet Singh cost it dear as it slumped to its first defeat in the second edition of the FIH Hockey Pro League, losing 2-3 to World champion Belgium here on Sunday.

After defeating World No. 3 the Netherlands in its opening two matches, India beat the top-ranked Belgium in a thrilling match on Saturday to continue its unbeaten run which lifted it to No. 4 in the World rankings.

But the Manpreet Singh-led side could not repeat Saturday’s performance and went down fighting in the second match.

Alexander Hendrickx scored off a penalty corner in the third minute for Belgium, but it was Maxime Plennevaux’s two field goals (17th, 26th) that ensured a win for the visitors.

India’s goals through Vivek Sagar Prasad (15th) and Amit Rohidas (17th).

The win enabled Belgium keep its top spot in the standings with 14 points from six games.

India is placed second with eight points from four matches.

The Red Lions took the lead as early as the third minute when Hendrickx found the target off a penalty corner after the efforts of Sebastien Dockier and Thomas Briels were brilliantly saved by India custodian P.R. Sreejesh.

India drew level eight seconds before the end of the first quarter when Vivek tapped home after Surender Kumar’s fine work from the right flank.

Belgium restored its lead two minutes into the second quarter through Plennevaux, who deflected home a beautiful pass from Simon Gougnard.

But it took India just 30 seconds to level the scores when Rohidas scored off a rebound from a penalty corner.

The Indians matched Belgium in every aspect of the game but a howler from Harmanpreet gave Belgium the lead four minutes before half-time. He was guilty of a giving away a loose ball which was picked up by Nicolas de Kerpel, who passed it on to Plennevaux. The latter made no mistake, scoring his second goal.

Down by a goal, the Indians made an aggressive start after the change of ends, securing a penalty corner soon, but Rohidas’ shot was saved by Belgium goalkeeper Vincent Vanasch. After Harmanpreet’s howler, the Indian defence produced a solid performance to thwart Belgium.

In the 44th minute, India earned another penalty corner but it fumbled.

India will play Australia in the third round of matches here on February 21 and 22.

The result:

Belgium 3 (Alexander Hendrickx 3-PC, Maxime Plennevaux 17, 26) bt India 2 (Vivek Sagar Prasad 15, Amit Rohidas 17).

21,2020/02/09,Watch | Sweden's Duplantis soars 6.17m to break pole vault world record,"World silver medallist Mondo Duplantis realised a lifetime dream when he broke the pole vault world record on Saturday by soaring 6.17 metres on his second attempt at a World Athletics Indoor Tour meeting in Torun in Poland.

SIX POINT SEVENTEEN METERS NEW WR @mondohoss600 pic.twitter.com/dkZHhIacNc — Andreas Duplantis (@dreasduplantis) February 8, 2020

American-born Swede Duplantis broke Frenchman Renaud Lavillenie's record of 6.16m set in February 2014 in Donetsk, Ukraine. “It's something that I wanted since I was three years old,” said the 20-year-old. “It's a big year, but it's a good way to start it.”

He broke the record on his sixth jump of the competition, having narrowly failed to clear the same height in Dusseldorf on Tuesday when he brushed the bar on his way down.

Duplantis had the runway all to himself for much of the evening as none of the other six competitors could vault higher than 5.52m. The wunderkind in the pole vault who began setting age group records at age seven opened his day at 5.52m, then cleared 5.72, 5.92 and a indoor lifetime best 6.01 without a miss.

Although born in the U.S. state of Louisiana, he chose to represent his mother's native country of Sweden. His father Greg, who is his coach, was a talented U.S. pole vaulter. His mother, Helena, is a former heptathlete and volleyball player in Sweden.

“It is all the more special when you happen to be the first Indian to get it across all Olympic disciplines,” the 46-year-old former All England champion said.

“Frankly, I think this is not just a recognition for me but for all coaches in India. And, coming in the Olympic year, it is a huge morale-booster to badminton,” said Gopi Chand, who has won most of the prestigious awards instituted by the Government of India.

23,2020/02/09,Golconda Golf | Udayan Mane has the last laugh,"Udayan Mane of Pune clinched the honours in the Vooty-Haldi-Golconda Masters Golf Championship at the Hyderabad Golf Club here on Saturday.

A clinical four-under 67 saw Udayan register back-to-back titles in the PGTI circuit.

Mane, who closed the week with a total of 267, clinched his ninth professional title with a two-shot margin at the season-opening ₹ 40 lakh event.

It was the 28-year-old’s second win at the Golconda Masters, following his 2018 triumph. Mane had also won PGTI’s last event, the 2019 season-ending Tour Championship in Jamshedpur in December.

Bengaluru’s Viraj Madappa delivered a splendid nine-under-62, the week’s best score, for the joint runner-up spot with a total of 269 along with Patna’s Aman Raj who fired a last round of five-under-66.

Udayan, a two-time winner last year, began to pull away from the rest with a birdie and an eagle on the par-5s sixth and eighth respectively sinking a 30-footer on the latter. He then produced a couple of accurate tee shots on the par-3s ninth and 11th to pick up birdies and build a commanding four-shot lead with seven holes to play.

“Back-to-back wins are always special and it feels awesome to have achieved it. I would love to take this form forward into the next events. It’s also good to win at the HGC for the second time. It’s turning out to be my happy hunting ground,” a jubilant Udayan said later.

Mane has now become the seventh player to win back-to-back titles on the PGTI after Ashok Kumar, Gaganjeet Bhullar, Shamim Khan, Anirban Lahiri, Mithun Perera and Honey Baisoya, who was the last to do so in 2018.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/3xe45c/article30772013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09Mane,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/golconda-golf-udayan-mane-has-the-last-laugh/article30772014.ece

25,2020/02/09,The much-reviled pyjamas,"They have dragged it into a controversy again. A few days ago, officials in the Chinese city of Suzhou in Anhui province shamed seven citizens by releasing their photos sporting pyjamas in public, calling it “uncivilised behaviour”. Following a public outcry against this assault on their privacy, authorities have apologised.

Not long ago, a British supermarket had refused entry to pyjama-clad shoppers. Around the same time, authorities managing a stadium in Kanpur had decreed that a morning walk is too solemn an activity to be performed in pyjamas. In quick succession, the Caddo commissioner in Louisiana, U.S., contemplated a law to prohibit people from wearing pyjamas in public. Actually, he rubbed it in by saying, “Today it’s pyjamas. Tomorrow it’s underwear. Where does it stop?”

It touches a raw nerve because pyjamas are not only the most harmless of clothes but also a bridge between cultural and gender divides. For centuries, men and women across the globe have felt nothing but comfort in pyjamas. Indeed, if there is one piece of garment that deserves to be called people’s wear, it is pyjamas.

Look how accommodative it is! We can spell it loosely as pyzamas, pajamas or paijamas. Which other garment would allow you to play with its name like that?

Truth is, to wear pyjamas day-long is one of the under-rated luxuries of human life. Unfortunately, for a sizeable section of society, all luxuries are guilt-edged. So, they coined a new expression to disparage people’s fondness for pyjamas. It is called ADPS (All Day Pyjama Syndrome). Is that how one should reward a stellar garment?

This is not to deny the notable exceptions to this rule. A ruler of Gondal, the erstwhile princely state of Saurashtra in Gujarat, was also a lexicographer and is credited with compiling the 16-volume Gujarati language dictionary called Bhagwadgomandal. Legend has it that while touring the interiors of his kingdom, if he came upon a new word and there were no paper at hand, he would scribble it down on his leg-wear called chorno, a Kathiawari version of pyjamas.

Times have changed and such royal patronage is now out of the question. Is there nobody who would take up the cause of pyjamas or at least treat the humble garment with dignity like George Fernandes who, even as a Union Minister, sported it everywhere?

26,2020/02/09,Embracing differences with elan in Sikkim,"I recently visited the Fambong Lho Wildlife Sanctuary in western Sikkim, 30 km from Gangtok, a 52-sq.km natural haven. But my experience was not limited to nature.

Entry to the sanctuary required authorisation from the Forest Department. So I took a local taxi for the Pangthang Forest Block and reached the office of the Eco-development Committee (EDC), which issues the permit. There was no one there. A few files and loose sheets lay at the reception desk. I stepped outside hoping to catch a human figure amid the cherry blossom trees and the Himalayan ranges all around. After a couple of minutes, I heard water splash on the floor. Someone was bathing in the washroom of the office!

“Hello? Hello?”

No response.

I knocked at the washroom door.

“I am taking a bath!”

I felt embarrassed to intrude into someone’s private space. All the same, I couldn’t wait too long. I needed to enter the sanctuary fast as the sun set early. So I relented.

“Okay. But I need the government-issued permit.”

“Call Kalpana. She’ll give you.”

I was confused. How was I supposed to know Kalpana?

“Who is Kalpana? I’m a tourist.”

Pat came the reply in an “obviously-I-know-that” tone.

“Yes yes! I know you’re a tourist! You’re unable to call Kalpana or what?”

Now l felt my common sense was under challenge! Of course, I could call Kalpana. What was so difficult in calling Kalpana, right? So I stepped outside the office, looked at the clouds travelling through the pines, and shouted at the top of my voice, “Kalpana … Kalpana.”

My taxi driver jumped out of his seat looking at me as if I was a nincompoop. He probably thought the high-altitude effect had kicked in.

In the next few seconds, from nowhere, a face popped up and a voice! A woman wearing the traditional Sikkimese gown called Kho came out of a passage between the mountains.

“Coming…”

She swiftly climbed up, sat at the desk, and asked for my identity card. In the quintessential pale yellow pages of a government diary, she began filling my details. I asked if there was a guide at the sanctuary to take me for a trek.

Her eyes lit up.

“I am a forest guide too. I will take you. Do you want to climb to the highest point 10 km uphill and downhill, or only up to the mid-point?”

It was too good to be true. Trekking with a woman who lives in the mountains…who could be a better forest guide than her?

“The full trek please.”

“Okay. Let me get ready. I will meet you down the road.”

Trekking shoes on, hair tied and a sleek backpack and pockets loaded with Churpi (cottage cheese cubes made of yak milk) in a jiffy, Kalpana had transformed into a trekker! She firmly instructed me on the pace I had to keep up and the weight I could carry. And off we were.

As they say, the rest is history. The next few hours marked a pristine trekking experience amid the dense cover of oak, bamboo, orchids, and ferns.

With hindsight, I realise that when I entered the office, I didn’t meet someone seated in a swanky setting available to engage with me exactly as I pleased. Instead, I heard a woman taking a bath (whose face I never got to see!), expecting me to be smart and rather hands-on! At any moment, I could’ve simply walked out, sat in my taxi grumpy, missed the experience of trekking in an impeccably preserved forest reserve, and spent the next few hours expressing disappointment with the “state of affairs”.

Sometimes, you just have to respect local knowledge and trust local styles of working. The culture and systems of places we visit will always be different from how things are organised in cities or the methods we are habituated to. But that doesn’t make the former any less dependable or inefficient. All it takes to embrace that difference is a handful of flexibility and a pinch of spontaneity.

27,2020/02/09,A race to the bottom,"Fitting in structures is the Indian way of growing up. Structures that are defined and regulated by societal norms but more so by our need to keep them intact. Anything beyond structures is believed fruitless.

All Indian parental categories from the upper class to a daily wage earner seek social security and standing in society accompanied by a sense of power that comes with a government job for their children. Its blinding charm has killed many a dream and persuaded students to give up their passions because no other profession or skill or art will ever garner the same respect as the vaunted government job.

The government service is the essence of Indian existence, and the preparation for recruitment exams is nothing less than venom for the creative mind. Direction-less and lost students from myriad cultural, socio-economic backgrounds gather in areas such as Mukherjee Nagar and Karol Bagh burning the midnight oil and cramming up data, figures and dates all day, the antithesis of independent thinking and of challenging structures.

The meals they used to have at home have suddenly transformed into luxuries. Dal tadka is now the infamous name for mildly spiced yellow water. Caffeine dependence through endless cups of tea and coffee has become the ultimate ingredient for rote learning. Smoking is the ominous topic that divides friends, peers and study buddies. They survive, imbibe and tolerate these life- and behaviour-altering habits just to get that one thing that society holds dear, a permanent job, leaving behind what they truly were and the hopes of what they wanted to become.

There is nothing wrong in aiming and aspiring to be that charming public servant or officer and catering to the needs of the people, but it is the herd behaviour that is ending dreams on a much larger scale. Not everyone is meant to conform. Not everyone is good at learning numbers. Not everyone works comfortably in hierarchical set-ups. “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid,” goes a famous saying. Aren’t we just reinforcing this calamitous structural conformity of how “all should climb” and swimming or flying or simply walking is either just too mundane or outrageously out of the structure?

Back in the 1950s and 1960s, when India followed the grand vision of Jawaharlal Nehru’s socialist economic policies, we gave the state the paramount power. A power that would soon mirror itself in all government employees. From top-notch bureaucrats to the simple clerk, these were the people who controlled everything in the country. Setting up industries, opening bank accounts, securing a phone connection or something as simple as purchasing cement required permits or licences. These permits were tightly controlled by the state or in plain words, the government servants. This is where the power circle was sealed.

The current crop of parents is a product of a time where the state and its employees had limitless power. Pre-1991, good jobs were available mostly in the government sector. Those times have changed. But have they really?

Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his “Pareeksha Pe Charcha” address, said that “marks are not life anymore”. But when we leave children out in the battlefield of competition right after Class 12, marks do matter. More than 12 lakh people apply for 11,800 vacancies in the Bihar police. Marks matter for these 12 lakh applicants; more so, because of the treasured government job. The question is not why, the question is why still?

We lack a system that provides that same admiration and recognition to other professions. Most important, we fail in the manner and method in which we teach children, both as teachers and as parents. No amount of poetry writing and recitation, art exhibition, painting competition and sports will yield results if they are only approved as hobbies or extracurricular activities, having no part to play in their future careers but only as a way of passing time. This belief that we ingrain in their impressionable young minds costs them creativity, an open mind and a fearless voice.

In such a scenario, these are the questions that conflict me, Why is the sales pitch for a government job so much more attractive than a job or a career that sustains the creativity within you and hones your passion? Why does that package get more numbers? Why shouldn’t other professions that boost your creativity get those numbers? Why is there no thirst to become a creative genius? Are we knowingly or unknowingly creating an atmosphere of security within the parameters of government services only? Are we being biased towards social power more than creative independence or freedom? Are we pushing our future generations to fail in an environment where there is no equilibrium between the two professions? Why one profession always get more respect and attention? Why have we failed in providing the same stately grandeur to other professions? Why is there no appreciation for impressive work in the realms of private jobs? Are we fortifying the argument of the state’s control and influence over our disenchanted lives when we relentlessly seek a government job?

As the world’s largest democracy, we are still stuck in a place where all means in life lead to one singular end: a government job. We may never truly know how many Picassos, Nerudas, Einsteins and Mary Shellys have we killed in this rat race. But if we realise now and teach our coming generations to believe in their journeys of learning rather than competing for a post that may not be their calling, we can still save a few. Or to identify, guide and not be part of a herd but always a leader. We can still change the face of this nation because as Plutarch said, “The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be ignited.”",open page,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/a-race-to-the-bottom/article30769885.ece
28,2020/02/09,Dialling back half a century,"Now almost everyone of us, rich and poor, young and old, men and women, has a mobile phone. But 50 years ago or even less, a phone was a luxury, a rarity. If you had a phone, you were a VIP or rich. Even the school I went to, which had some 500 students, did not have a phone connection.

The street where we lived in the 1960s had some 50 houses. Only two of them had phone connections. While one belonged to an official of the Telephones Department, the other was of a rich businessman. The rest of the inhabitants of our street used to go and stand at the gates of either of these privileged houses for permission to make a call.

The Telephones Department official who did not have to pay for the calls charged us 50 paise for one. But the businessman allowed free calls. But his Doberman was always waiting for an opportunity to charge at us. “Don’t be scared of him. He won’t bite you. I am here,” he would say as he guided me to the corner of the hall where the black glistening instrument stood on a pedestal. The dog would now sit at arm’s length and watch the intruder with a suppressed fury.

At times, the businessman would leave the room leaving me alone with his Doberman. On such occasions, even if I noticed a small movement in the dog, my heart used to come to my mouth and I stopped talking. How on earth could one could talk in such a condition!

Having lived in both eras, I could not help comparing the old times with new. Then we had to beg and take risks just to make a phone call. Now every one of us is a phone booth in which of course, we voluntarily imprison ourselves.

29,2020/02/09,Cynics are the true clairvoyants,"Cynics are easy to spot. Around this time, they spread the word that the year ahead is going to be terrible. Probe a bit to ask that classic question about the glass, and their response would be predictable — it’s half-empty.

Given these off-centre views, cynics are not cut out to win popularity contests. How do I know all this? I am a card-carrying cynic myself, and I believe it’s time we votaries of worst-case scenarios did a bit of brand building for ourselves. We disbelieved the stuff we read in newspapers decades before fake news became an industry standard. We complained that summer afternoons were getting warmer when Greta Thunberg was only the proverbial gleam in her father’s eye. We dismissed the U.S. presidency as a joke long before Trump took over.

The fact is the world is too trusting for its own good. Far from the “trust deficit” everyone seems to be talking about, what society suffers from is a trust surfeit — a gullibility glut, with unwary (and, ahem, un-cynical) people ready to get off the mark and spout passwords, PINs and OTPs to anyone who comes along with a get-rich-quick scheme. If only they had consulted the watchdogs of society’s well-being (us nay sayers). How does a cynic look? No, we don’t have horns. Nor is a scowl our default expression. My smile in real life is actually as wide as my social profile picture. And there’s a good reason for this genial disposition. When you constantly expect the worst, you are pleasantly surprised at what happens.

Here’s what we cynics do best: we make responsible account-holders in banks because we never believe what any bank says in its website. We hold up the banner of common sense at a time when people oscillate between absurd extremes.

When a happiness guru happens along and recommends a mantra that will dispel everything from toothache to heartache, we treat him the way you treat an e-mail from Ethiopia.

And when someone predicts that the world will end this afternoon, we simply move on.

30,2020/02/09,"Ensure peace at home, let children grow up happy","Conflicts and disagreements are common in every family. Some issues get settled without any heated arguments, whereas some problems leave a major impact on the entire family.

Have you ever thought how would your children get emotionally disturbed after being a witness to a fight or conflict? It is not only physical fights that bring in serious psychological consequences but also a few destructive disagreement tactics that leads to harmful results in children.

To mention a few, name calling, insults, physical aggression and threats to leave the house or divorce create a negative impact on children. The relationship between parents and children also gets affected since parents have the tendency to show their anger on their children during stressful situation.

Research studies revealed that children from the age of six months to 19 years get affected physically and psychologically due to conflicts between their parents. They become emotionally unstable, hesitate to mingle with other children, stay away from their parents, lose interest in academic performance, develop a negative attitude towards family relationships, face eating and sleeping disorders and show signs of depression and abnormal behaviour.

When parents start disrespecting each other in front of their children, they also grow up with the same attitude. Remember, learning begins at home. So, it becomes necessary for us to be careful in our actions and words. Avoid talking ill about your partner in front of your children as it creates a bad image about you or your spouse.

Avoid complaining about the negative aspects and share positive thoughts with your children. Make sure that your child doesn’t get involved in your fights. Instead of converting arguments into major issues, try your best to solve them at the very beginning so that it doesn’t get dragged out for a long time. Make your children understand that what you did was wrong and give them the confidence that you still love each other.

Conflicts and disagreements are a part of married life. How to resolve them in a manner that does not affect children adversely is what you must give attention to. Children can express themselves fully only when they feel loved, cared for and secured. Therefore, parents should create a positive environment for their children to help them shape and develop their personality, physical and mental well-being.

31,2020/02/09,When a drug turned killer,"One night in August 1973, as the duty paediatric surgeon at the Institute of Child Health at Egmore in Chennai, I was called to see an 18-month-old child facing acute renal failure.

A general practitioner had earlier treated the infant for fever. A nephrologist from the government general hospital was then called to see the child. A peritoneal dialysis was tried, but the child did not recover.

Within a week, every day brought one child or two with kidney failure to the institute. So its director, V. Balagopal Raju, convened a meeting of all specialists. By month-end, more than 15 children underwent peritoneal dialysis, but none of them survived and the cause was still not known.

Some time earlier, a relative of one of my colleagues had started a pharmaceutical company and he met me with his products. Introducing a paracetamol solution with vitamin C labelled Pipmol C, he gave me a couple of bottles as samples, saying the transparent clear solution had a palatable taste. I took one bottle to the clinic. The sample kept at home fell from the cupboard and broke.

Next week, a child from my neighbourhood, who had seen me a week earlier, was admitted with acute renal failure. A sense of fear gripped me since I had a one-year-old son and a daughter of three years.

I went through the history of the illness of the child and the drugs administered. The only new drug was the Pipmol C sample given for fever from the clinic. It struck me like lightning that this solution could be responsible for the renal failure. I ran to the next block in the hospital where another child was undergoing peritoneal dialysis. To my shock, that child also had Pipmol C.

I requested A. Peter, the dynamic head of the medical records department of the institute, to get the addresses of all the children who had died. More than 15 had died, and I could get the addresses of all.

Enquiry begins

I visited the house of the first child in a slum at Tondiarpet and requested the parents to show the prescription and the drugs administered before hospitalisation. The mother went to the backyard and brought the empty medicine bottles. One was of Pipmol C. Within 48 hours, after visiting the house of every child who had died, the enquiry revealed that all of them had Pipmol C. Before long, it was proved beyond doubt that all the children who died of renal failure had Pipmol C.

We met a senior Professor at the institute to take immediate action. He was not convinced that paracetamol in normal dosage would cause renal failure and made light of it. He asked if soda was mixed with whisky, brandy or gin, was soda responsible for the drunkenness since it was the common denominator.

However, Dr. Raju went through all the details and was convinced that Pipmol C was the culprit. He got the samples of Pipmol C brought by us and sent it urgently by a messenger to the State Drugs Controller’s office.

He called up Narasimhan, the Drugs Controller, to analyse the samples and asked him to give the report immediately.

At 6 p.m., Mr. Narasimhan called to say that all the samples contained diethylene glycol as the solvent, highly toxic to the kidneys. The usual solvent is propylene glycol.

Dr. Raju immediately drafted a letter to All India Radio to broadcast that Pipmol C was a toxic drug and should not be given to children. He asked me to hurry to the radio station, which broadcast the message immediately and repeated it for the next 48 hours. Dr. Raju called a press conference and all the leading dailies carried the report the next day.

Deadly mistake

Investigation by the Drugs Controller revealed that a wholesale company in Chennai which regularly distributed propylene glycol substituted it with diethylene glycol by mistake. Action was taken against its erring chemist. The drug company was closed.

Dr. Raju ordered a chemical analysis of all other drugs in which propylene glycol was used.

Even after 46 years, the incident should remain an eye opener to pharmaceutical companies.

38,2020/02/09,GRP constable carries unwell man to ambulance on shoulder,"A constable with the Government Railway Police (GRP) saved the life of a Badlapur resident by hoisting him on his shoulder and carrying him to the ambulance without waiting for a stretcher.

According to GRP officials, Prakash Gachhe,45, got off a train at Ghatkopar station around 9 a.m. on Friday. He felt a pain in his chest and started calling for help. Constable Dhananjay Gawli, posted with the Kurla GRP, was on duty at the time and rushed to his assistance.

“An announcement was made for a stretcher to pick up Mr. Gacche, but I realised that none of the stretcher bearers were around and he was in too much pain. I picked him up on my shoulders and took him to the ambulance, which was standing outside the railway station on the East side. He was rushed to Rajawadi Hospital,” Mr. Gawli said. Mr. Gachhe was admitted to the medical intensive care unit, where doctors said he would be kept under observation for a few days. “When Mr. Gachhe was brought in, his blood pressure was normal and no untoward symptoms were seen. The patient is stable, but we will keep him under observation for two to three days,” a doctor from the hospital said.

Mr. Gachche’s wife, Karuna, said he was fine when he left his residence around 7.30 a.m. She said he had felt a similar pain one month ago and had been admitted to Rajawadi Hospital.

39,2020/02/09,Mumbai exhibition to trace history of Air India,"Air India might be on the block, but the rich history it carries will be the focus of Maharaja of the Skies — An Indian Heritage, a pictorial exhibition on the journey of India’s national carrier.

Organised by the Society for Culture and Environment, the three-day exhibition will be held at the Nehru Centre in Worli between February 13 and 16. The event will be inaugurated by Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani.

Meera Das, secretary of the Society for Culture and Environment, who has curated the exhibition, said there would be 2,200 photographs and eight posters on display. These include the Air India calendar being created.

The exhibition will have 10 sections, namely The Beginning, JRD, Art Collection, Fleet and Engineering, Service Mission, Maharajah, Booking Offices, Advertising and Promotion, Inflight Services, and Cargo. There will be 125 panels displaying Air India archived photographs.

Among the photographs on display will be those from a wedding that took place on an aircraft.

In-flight wedding

“Visuals from an in-flight wedding arranged by jeweller Laxman Popley in 1994 as a gift to his son and daughter-in-law will be on display. The aircraft was beautifully decorated and the guests were given specially-designed tickets and boarding passes. All this will be there for visitors to see,” said Uttara Parikh, a former management trainee who went on to retire as deputy commercial director of advertising and promotions and product development, Air India.

Ms. Parikh is helping in bringing out the national carrier’s history through this exhibition.

Post the wedding, the airline presented free tickets to the newly-weds to Switzerland. Also on display will be photographs of dresses designed by the late Roshan Kalapesi, who designed crew outfits with a pink theme to represent Jaipur. For her work, Kalapesi was gifted a ticket to London and back.

Ms. Parikh said artist B. Prabha had done a series of paintings on Indian Women as a theme in 1956. The airline purchased these paintings for just ₹87.50 with an idea to promote them on the menu cards.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cm9rv/article30777411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10AIRINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-exhibition-to-trace-history-of-air-india/article30777412.ece
40,2020/02/09,One held for robbery at Nutan’s bungalow,"A man was arrested on Saturday for allegedly stealing taps and pipes from noted yesteryear film actor late Nutan’s bungalow in Mumbra area of Thane district, the police said.

The theft was carried out in the early hours of February 3 by three people who overpowered the two watchmen posted at the bungalow and got into the house after removing some roof tiles, Crime Branch Unit I Assistant Inspector Sandeep Bagul said.

“Acting on a tip-off, we managed to arrest Sanjay Bhandari from Bhaskar Nagar of Kalwa, He has told us his two accomplices were Jitu Waghmare and Ganpat Gular. Efforts are on to nab the duo,” he added.

42,2020/02/09,Maharashtra government cancels allotment of CIDCO land to private developer,"The Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has terminated allotment of a controversial City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) land at Kharghar to a private developer by the previous BJP government.

Upon the recommendation of the Raigad Collector, the State government last month cancelled the deal for the 24-acre land which was allegedly given away to a private developer for ₹Rs 3.6 crore as against the market rate of ₹1,767 crore by the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government.

‘Breach of conditions’

Sources in the Collector’s office said the allotment was cancelled last month on grounds of ‘breach of conditions’ by the allottees.

“The cancellation was done two weeks back and a report submitted to the State government subsequently. Since the deal is called off, it nullifies the ‘irregularities’ mentioned in the report of the retired judge R.C. Chavan,” the source said.

In 2018, the Congress had alleged that 24 acres of CIDCO land in Kharghar, which was allotted to the project affected people of Koyna dam, was sold to select builders at an extremely low price.

Judicial probe

Reacting to the allegations, the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had announced in the Assembly a judicial probe into the land deal after the Congress accused him of being involved in the transaction.

The judicial committee headed by retired judge R.C. Chavan had found “irregularities” in the allotment.

The State government had last year asked the Urban Development Department (UDD) and the Raigad Collector to submit their statements on the findings.

“The Chavan committee report had clearly mentioned the rule for allotment of land to the PAPs too were never followed. The allotment was done out of turn, the committee had found,” said an official of the State UDD department.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7txtan/article30773189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BMCIDCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-government-cancels-allotment-of-cidco-land-to-private-developer/article30773190.ece
43,2020/02/09,Two students from Kerala quarantined at Mumbai hospital,"Two medical students who returned from Wuhan on January 25 were placed under isolation at the Mumbai’s Kasturba Hospital on Friday due to suspected exposure to the novel coronavirus (nCoV). The students, who are originally from Kerala, were studying in Wuhan province, the epicentre of the nCoV outbreak.

State health officials said they have no symptoms like fever, sore throat or nasal congestion. According to additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, they have been admitted for testing and their samples have been sent to National Institute of Virology in Pune.

Meanwhile, the Chinese national who was admitted to a hospital in Pune on Friday after he vomited in mid-air in an Air India flight has tested negative.

Till date, 35 people have been placed under isolation across the State of whom 30 tested negative, including the Chinese national and another person admitted at the district hospital in Ahmednagar. Reports of five others are awaited.

44,2020/02/09,Central Railway’s AC local slowly gaining acceptance,"Central Railway’s only air conditioned local train is slowly gaining acceptance and patronage from commuters. While the sale of single journey and return journey tickets have been averaging at around 250 single journey tickets per day, CR officials said that they are selling over 1,000 season passes every day since Tuesday.

“The sale of season passes points to a sustained ridership in the coming months and weeks. We aim to improve our sale numbers in the coming weeks,” Shivaji Sutar, Chief Public Relations Officer, CR, said.

Season pass holders account for around 80% of all passengers across the suburban network. Since the start of the service CR officials said they have sold 5,000 season passes for AC service, the highest being on Wednesday, when 1,496 season tickets were sold. On Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, CR sold 1,402, 1,088 and 998 passes.

The service got off to a rocky start on January 31, with a near stampede-like situation at Thane station on the first morning of its commercial operations and many commuters have since criticised the service on social media for running empty. CR runs 16 AC services, eight each in the morning and evening, on the Trans Harbour Line.

CR officials feel that the service will have teething issues for the first month but were confident that commuters would adopt it. “Typically pass holders wait for their current passes to expire before migrating to a new one,” a senior CR official, said. While the Railway Board has allowed first class pass holders to pay the difference to migrate to an AC pass, the rule stipulates that a person needs to pay the difference for the entire duration of the pass regardless of the valid days left on their first class passes. Railway officials said this was the reason why commuters who have only 10 or 15 days left, prefer to wait before buying a new pass. CR officials are also planning to approach corporate houses with offices in Ghansoli, Airoli and Rabale, to encourage the employees to use the AC local.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/central-railways-ac-local-slowly-gaining-acceptance/article30772967.ece
45,2020/02/09,Two from Mumbra held for cheating senior citizens at ATMs,"The Kasarwadavli police in Thane have arrested two Mumbra residents who have allegedly cheated senior citizens at Automated Transaction Machine (ATM) kiosks across the country by switching their cards while engaging in a conversation with them.

According to the Kasarwadavli police, the duo have been identified as Giyasuddin Siddiqui (26) and Shaizaan Aaga (24), both bakers by profession. Officers said that inquiries were initiated against them after Thane resident Sadanand Vaidya (65) registered a complaint on February 3 this year.

“Mr. Vaidya was withdrawing cash from an ATM kiosk on the Ghodbunder Road on February 1 when one of the accused approached him and started a conversation. While keeping him talking, the accused switched Mr. Vaidya's debit card with a dummy card. Mr. Vaidya only realised this on February 3, when he got a message saying ₹19,000 had been withdrawn from his account,” senior police inspector Kishore Khairnar, Kasarwadavli police station said.

An FIR of cheating was filed against unidentified persons under the Indian Penal Code and multiple teams were formed to investigate. While one team started scanning CCTV footage at and around the kiosk, other teams sought information from other police stations about similar offences to see if the accused in those cases could be suspects in this case as well.

Using technical and human investigation, the police zeroed in on the arrested duo and on Thursday received information that they would be near the Mumbra railway station. Accordingly, a trap was laid and the duo were picked up as soon as they showed up.

“We have seized 55 cards issued by 13 banks, both nationalised and private, from the duo. Inquiries till now indicate that they have committed offences not only in Mumbai and Thane but also in Navi Mumbai, Pune, Solapur, Jaipur and Karnataka.

Acting on a tip-off, the team first caught Dinesh Ramsahay Arya (65) from Pawane village who was waiting outside his shop. “We found one kg ganja in his possession and on further interrogation, he led us to his house at Shivkrupa chawl where we found an additional 27.8 kg ganja. The consignment is worth ₹6.72 lakh,” said assistant police inspector Gangadhar Devde from APMC police station who is a part of the special squad.

Mr. Arya’s questioning revealed that he was one of the biggest dealers of ganja in Navi Mumbai and supplied at least four kg daily to his customers. The police are looking into the source of the ganja.

The special squad was formed by Zone I Deputy Commissioner of Police, Pankaj Dahane five months back. It has since been conducting raids at bus stands, railway stations, gardens, schools, colleges and malls, registered 71 cases under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, and arrested 126 people.

47,2020/02/09,"Tata Open Maharashtra | Jiri Vesely outlasts Egor Gerasimov, ends long drought","Jiri Vesely ended a five-year ATP Tour title-drought after beating Egor Gerasimov 7-6(2), 5-7, 6-3 in the final of the Tata Open Maharashtra on Sunday.

The Czech, who last won a title at Auckland in early 2015, is the first player outside the top-100 to win India’s only ATP Tour event in its 25-year history. Come Monday, he is set to gain more than 30 places and find a position in the high 70s.

“A week ago I would not have thought of this,” the 26-year-old said after the triumph. “It’s only February and having a title already feels great. In every single year I had big successes, highlights, like playing the fourth round at Wimbledon in 2016 and 2018. But I was never able to push on. So now I need to stay focused in the next tournaments.”

For the 27-year-old Gerasimov, who played his first final, the week gone by was like an audition and at the end of it there was no doubting his talent. Against Vesely, he looked a tad subdued compared to his earlier matches. But he made Vesely play his best match of the tournament.

Vesely started the evening with two crunching forehand winners — a significant improvement from his last two matches — and broke Gerasimov in the very first game. Even as the Belarusian restored parity immediately, Vesely kept up the pressure. In the third and the ninth games, he had Gerasimov at 0-30 but the latter held on admirably. In the tie-break, though, from 3-2, Vesely reeled off four straight points to take a one-set lead.

“I was not really happy with the first set,” Gerasimov said. “I didn’t push in the beginning. Tie-break is a lottery. There wasn’t a big difference between us. Just up and down and I had to execute at the right moment.”

Levelling it

That moment arrived in the 11th game of the second set when he stretched Vesely on the forehand side way beyond the tramlines. One of two errors Vesely made thus was on breakpoint and Gerasimov duly served out the set on his first opportunity.

The third was perhaps Vesely’s best set all week, making 75% of first serves against 63% the whole match and winning 83% of those. He broke to 2-0 after Gerasimov had gone 30-0 up by displaying the kind of staying power in long rallies that had deserted him earlier in the competition. Up 4-2, he finished on the right side of a nearly 20-shot rally that seemed to suck out every last ounce of energy left in Gerasimov. Serving at 5-3, he held to love to seal the contest.

“I have to be realistic,” Vesely said. “I had a lot of luck during the week, saving so many match points, especially in the quarters and semis. It’s something that happens maybe once in a lifetime. I had to stay calm in important moments and I am really happy about that.”

Rungkat’s distinction

Earlier in the evening, Christopher Rungkat became the first Indonesian to win a Tour event when he clinched the doubles title in the company of Swede Andre Goransson, defeating Jonathan Erlich and Andrei Vasilevski 6-2, 3-6, [10-8].

The results: Finals: Singles: Jiri Vesely (Cze) bt Egor Gerasimov (Blr) 7-6(2), 5-7, 6-3.

48,2020/02/09,Bengaluru Open | Indian hopes rest on defending champion Prajnesh Gunneswaran shoulders,"Tennis fans will savour the chance to watch Leander Paes in action, perhaps for one last time in the city, at the $162,000 Bengaluru Open ATP Challenger that commences at the KSLTA Stadium here on Monday.

Paes, who is set to retire at the end of the year, is sure to be the cynosure of all eyes in this week-long tournament. The 1996 Olympic bronze medallist and 18-time Grand Slam champion partners Australian Mathew Ebden in the men’s doubles event.

The duo faces the unheralded pair of Zhang Zhizhen and Blaz Rola in the first round on Wednesday.

Felicitation

The Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association is keen to make it a memorable occasion for Paes, with plans to host a grand felicitation function in his honour.

In the singles section, Indian hopes rest on the shoulders of defending champion Prajnesh Gunneswaran and 2017 winner Sumit Nagal.

The field suffered a setback with the late withdrawal of top-seed Ricardas Berankis owing to medical reasons. As a result, Ramkumar Ramanathan entered the seeded bracket and received a first-round bye.

“Bengaluru has been a happy hunting ground for me. I like the conditions here, although the ball plays a bit tricky. I hope to continue my good run here,” southpaw Gunneswaran (World No. 122) stated.

Nagal, who currently holds a career-high world ranking of 125, said, “My focus has shifted to playing hard-court tournaments. A good first serve, solid backhand groundstroke, and being comfortable at the net — these are things that I’m working on.”

Foreign contingent

The foreign contingent is led by Italian Stefano Travaglia (World No. 82), who finished runner-up in the Bendigo 2 Championship in Australia last month.

Japan’s Yuichi Sugita, who reached a career-high world ranking of 36 two seasons ago, is coming off a quarterfinal loss to Berankis in the Tata Open Maharashtra a few days ago. Third-seeded James Duckworth of Australia reached his maiden ATP Tour semifinal at the Tata Open Maharashtra. Zhizhen is the only player in the field from China — the nation worst hit by the Coronavirus.

49,2020/02/09,Fed Cup to be held in Dubai in March: ITF,"The Indian Fed Cup team will travel to Dubai for this year’s competition as the ITF has named the desert city as the new venue for the matches, to be held from March 3 to 7.

The ITF named the new venue after moving out the matches from the Chinese city of Dongguan due to Coronavirus threat. The Asia/Oceania Group I matches were originally scheduled to be played from February 4-8.

“The event will be held in the week following the ATP Dubai tournament at the same venue, and will see six nations — China P.R., Chinese Taipei, India, Indonesia, Korea Rep. and Uzbekistan - compete for a place in the Fed Cup Play-offs in April,” an ITF release said.

The six teams will vie for two spots in Fed Cup Play-offs.

“Being in Dubai makes no difference. But the dates give enough time to Sania (Mirza) for her recovery. Doubles is an important point. Ankita is playing well. The other team members will also get some tournament to play under their belt,” India’s Fed Cup captain Vishal Uppal told PTI.

Sania’s participation was under doubt due to a calf injury she aggravated during the Australian Open, where she pulled out of the mixed doubles before retiring mid-way into her women’s doubles opening round match.

53,2020/02/09,Thousands from cruise ship in Hong Kong freed after virus tests,"Thousands of people stranded aboard a cruise ship in Hong Kong for five days were allowed to disembark on Sunday after its 1,800 crew tested negative for the deadly new coronavirus.

Health authorities in the Asian financial hub said the crew and a similar number of passengers had been released from a quarantine imposed because of fears some staff could have contracted the deadly virus on a previous voyage and passed it on.

The World Dream carried three Chinese passengers to Vietnam between January 19 and 24 who were later found to be infected with the SARS-like coronavirus, which has killed more than 800 people in China since it emerged in December.

The government grounded the ship on its arrival in Hong Kong Wednesday while tests were carried out on the crew, but said the passengers need not undergo examination as they had no contact with the three sick holidaymakers on the January trip.

First found in the city of Wuhan in central China last December, the virus has infected more than 36,000 people on the Chinese mainland and at least 26 in Hong Kong.

The passengers and crew isolated on the vessel had been expecting to stay aboard until Tuesday after Hong Kong authorities said testing would take at least four days.

But chief port health officer Leung Yiu-hong said Sunday “all tests have results this afternoon and are all negative”.

He added that passenger testing was deemed unnecessary because they were at relatively low risk. All 3,600 onboard will not be required to self-quarantine after leaving.

As he left the ship, passenger Rocky Chan said quarantine conditions had been “okay”, though his time on board had caused him a few problems.

“My job was somewhat affected due to the time I had to spend here,” he said, but added that a letter he received from the Department of Health should smooth out any issues.

Vice-president of marketing at Dream Cruises, Phoebe Yip Ching-man said the company arranged for dozens of coaches to take passengers into the city, while free hotel rooms were booked for the more than 100 foreign passport holders on board who needed them.

Hong Kong on Saturday began enforcing a 14-day quarantine period on all people arriving from mainland China in a fresh bid to curb the spread of the virus.

The city's health minister Sunday morning said 468 people had so far been ordered to stay at home, in hotel rooms or at a government quarantine camp since the policy took effect.

54,2020/02/09,Israel blocks agricultural exports from Palestine in escalating trade crisis,"The Israeli Military blocked Palestinian agricultural exports on Sunday in the latest escalation of a months-long trade war that comes amid fears of renewed violence as well.

Following Defence Minister Naftali Bennett’s instruction, the military said it would not allow the Palestinians to transfer their products through their land crossing to Jordan, the West Bank’s only direct export route to the outside world.

The Western-backed Palestinian Authority said Israeli forces at checkpoints blocked vegetable shipments that were on their way for export. The Ministry of Agriculture statement said vegetable exports to Israel were worth $88 million last year, comprising 68% of the West Bank’s overall vegetable exports.

The crisis erupted in September, when the Palestinians decided to stop importing beef from Israel. The Palestinian Authority claimed most of the 120,000 head of cattle they imported monthly from Israel was itself imported and that they therefore preferred to import directly from abroad. The move appeared aimed at reducing the Palestinians’ economic dependence on Israel.

Shortly after the September announcement, Israeli cattle ranchers saw a drop in their market and pressured Israeli authorities to take action. Mr. Bennett retaliated with a ban on Palestinian beef and other products, triggering Palestinians to expand their boycott, and stop importing Israeli vegetables, fruits, beverages and mineral water.

The Palestinians say their actions are aided at pressuring Israel into revoking its ban, while Israel says normal trade will be restored the moment the Palestinians reverse the cattle ban that started the crisis in the first place.

The trade crisis comes amid a surge in violence following the release of President Trump’s West Asia plan, which the Palestinians have rejected. A week of protests culminated Thursday with an early morning attack on Israeli soldiers, which left more than a dozen wounded, and clashes in which four Palestinians were killed.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/48h9sh/article30775946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9FEBISRAEL-POLITICSjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/israel-blocks-agricultural-exports-from-palestine-in-escalating-trade-crisis/article30775917.ece
55,2020/02/09,Millions left Shanghai before quarantine,"For weeks after the first reports of a mysterious new virus in Wuhan, millions of people poured out of the central Chinese city, cramming onto buses, trains and planes as the first wave of China’s great Lunar New Year migration broke across the nation. Some carried with them the new virus that has since claimed over 8 00 lives and sickened more than 37,000 people.

Officials finally began to seal the borders on Jan. 23. But it was too late. Speaking to reporters a few days after the the city was put under quarantine, the mayor estimated that 5 million people had already left.

Where did they go?

An Associated Press analysis of domestic travel patterns using map location data from Chinese tech giant Baidu shows that in the two weeks before Wuhan’s lockdown, nearly 70% of trips out of the central Chinese city were within Hubei province. Baidu has a map app that is similar to Google Maps, which is blocked in China.

Another 14% of the trips went to the neighboring provinces of Henan, Hunan, Anhui and Jiangxi. Nearly 2% slipped down to Guangdong province, the coastal manufacturing powerhouse across from Hong Kong, and the rest fanned out across China. The cities outside Hubei province that were top destinations for trips from Wuhan between Jan. 10 and Jan. 24 were Chongqing, a municipality next to Hubei province, Beijing and Shanghai.

The travel patterns broadly track with the early spread of the virus. The majority of confirmed cases and deaths have occurred in China, within Hubei province, followed by high numbers of cases in central China, with pockets of infections in Chongqing, Shanghai and Beijing as well.

""It’s definitely too late,” said Jin Dong-Yan, a molecular virologist at Hong Kong University’s School of Biomedical Sciences. “Five million out. That’s a big challenge. Many of them may not come back to Wuhan but hang around somewhere else. To control this outbreak, we have to deal with this. On one hand, we need to identify them. On the other hand, we need to address the issue of stigma and discrimination.”

Baidu gathers travel data based on more than 120 billion daily location requests from its map app and other apps that use Baidu’s location services. Only data from users who agree to share their location is recorded and the company says data is masked to protect privacy. Baidu’s publicly available data shows proportional travel, not absolute numbers of recorded trips, and does not include trips by people who don’t use mobile phones or apps that rely on Baidu’s popular location services.

Public health officials and academics have been using this kind of mapping data for years to track the potential spread of disease.

A group of researchers from Southampton University’s WorldPop research group, which studies population dynamics, used 2013-2015 data from Baidu’s location services and international flight itineraries to make a predictive global risk map for the likely spread of the virus from Wuhan.

It’s important to understand the population movements out of Wuhan before the city’s lock down, said Lai Shengjie, a WorldPop researcher who used to work at China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Maybe they hadn’t developed symptoms but could transmit the virus. We need to look at destinations across China and the world and focus on the main destinations and try to prepare for disease control and prevention,” he said.

The last trains left Wuhan the morning of Jan. 23, cutting off a surge of outbound travel that had begun three days earlier, Baidu data shows. Nearby cities rushed to impose travel restrictions of their own. From Jan. 23 to Jan. 26, the 15 cities that Baidu data shows received the most travelers from Wuhan – a combined 70% – all imposed some level of travel restrictions.

Other nations soon followed suit, including the United States, Australia, Singapore, New Zealand and the Philippines, all of which have sharply restricted entry for people coming from China. Others, like Italy and Indonesia, have barred flights.

WorldPop researchers found that travel out of Wuhan has historically ramped up in the weeks before Lunar New Year’s Day. Based on historical travel patterns, they identified 18 high-risk cities within China that received the most travelers from Wuhan during this period. They then used 2018 flight itineraries from the International Air Transport Association to map the global connectivity of those cities.

They note that travel patterns after restrictions started rolling out on Jan. 23 will not match historical norms and that the cities they identified are initial ports of landing; travelers could have subsequently moved elsewhere.

The top 10 global destinations for travelers from high-risk Chinese cities around Lunar New Year, according to their analysis, were Thailand, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, the United States, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Australia.

In Africa, Egypt, South Africa, Ethiopia, Mauritius, Morocco, Nigeria and Kenya topped the list.

The African continent is particularly vulnerable because of the weaker health infrastructure in many countries, and the longer cases go undetected, the more likely they are to spread.

""Capacity is quite weak in many African health services,” Dr. Michel Yao, emergency operations manager for the World Health Organization in Africa, told the AP. This new virus “could overwhelm health systems we have in Africa.”

The Africa Centers for Disease Control, formed three years ago in response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa, said screening has been stepped up at ports of entry across Africa. Egypt began screening passengers from affected areas in China on Jan. 16. Over the next eight days, Nigeria, Ethiopia, South Africa, Mauritius and Kenya all put screening systems in place. No confirmed cases have been reported.

Lai and his colleagues said they found a “high correlation” between the early spread of coronavirus cases and the geographical risk patterns they identified.

The first case of the virus outside China was reported on Jan. 13 in Thailand, followed two days later by Japan, the countries with the highest connectivity risk, according to WorldPop’s analysis. Within 10 days of Wuhan’s quarantine, the virus had spread to more than two dozen countries; nine of the 10 countries with the most flight connections to at-risk mainland cities also had the highest numbers of confirmed cases, mostly afflicting people who had been in China.

The pattern isn’t perfect; Zhejiang province, for example, was not a top destination from Wuhan this year, according to Baidu data, but now has among the highest numbers of confirmed cases.

""Our aim was to help guide some of the surveillance and thinking around the control measures,” said Andrew Tatem, the director of WorldPop, adding that his group plans to update their analysis.

""There was a huge amount of movement out of the Wuhan region before the controls came into place,” he said. “Now we’re getting to stage of having data from multiple places on the scale of outbreaks elsewhere.”

Scientists have identified the new virus as a coronavirus, a family of viruses that includes ones that can cause the common cold, as well as others that cause more serious illnesses, like SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome.

Many are now focused on what will happen after the second wave of the Lunar New Year rush as people once again crowd onto trains, buses and planes to head back to work. The Chinese government extended the holiday, which was supposed to end on Jan. 30, to Feb. 2. Shanghai, Beijing and several Chinese provinces ordered businesses to remain shut through Sunday, leaving the nation’s great megalopolises feeling like ghost towns.

""It’s in cities where people interact much more,” Tatem said. “That’s potentially the worry of lots of people coming back in. A few people seeding that could result in a bigger problem.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jp7hs0/article30775857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHEMPTYCITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/millions-left-shanghai-before-quarantine/article30775858.ece
56,2020/02/09,Ireland elections | Three parties neck-and-neck as counting begins,"Irish officials started counting votes on Sunday in a general election forecast to put prime minister Leo Varadkar's party in a historic three-way tie after a surge from republican party Sinn Fein.

Counting began at 0900 GMT after an exit poll predicted Varadkar's incumbent Fine Gael party, the Fianna Fail party and Sinn Fein all received 22% of first preference votes in Saturday's election.

In Dublin's main count centre staff unsealed and emptied black ballot boxes onto ranks of tables as party members anxiously looked on.

The outcome of the vote has been thrown into uncertainty by a dramatic surge in support for Sinn Fein.

An Ipsos MRBI exit poll of around 5,000 voters, issued as the polls closed on Saturday, put Fine Gael on 22.4%, Sinn Fein on 22.3% and Fianna Fail on 22.2%. The survey has an estimated margin of error of 1.3%.

However, Ireland uses a single transferable vote system to elect multiple deputies from each of the 39 constituencies, making it hard to extrapolate a likely seat forecast from the first preference votes exit poll.

That means every ballot of the estimated 3.3 million-strong electorate will count in the battle to form the next government.

Some 159 seats are up for grabs in the Dail, the Republic of Ireland's lower house of parliament, but filling them may not be quick due to the multiple rounds of counting required.

Eunan O'Halpin of Trinity College Dublin university said it would take “perhaps two-and-a-half days for the full picture to be known” in terms of seats.

Coalition posturing

The shape of the government could take much longer to come into focus and may hinge on inter-party negotiations once the seat spread becomes clear.

Following Ireland's 2016 election it took 70 days before a new minority coalition government was formed under Fine Gael.

During this year's election campaign, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail both ruled out working with Sinn Fein, citing the party's historic links to the Irish Republican Party paramilitary group.

During “The Troubles” — 30 years of bloodshed when 3,500 were killed by bombs and bullets — the party acted as the political wing of the IRA in its battle to unite the British territory of Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland.

Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin also said he would not back centre-right rivals Fine Gael in a “grand coalition”. But his party has propped up the Fine Gael minority government through a confidence and supply arrangement since the last election — suggesting common ground could be found again.

And analysts have said statements ruling out coalitions could be pre-election posturing, and party stances may change as the parliamentary arithmetic becomes clear.

“We've never seen a general election result like it. Basically a statistical tie between what are now the three big parties,” said Pat Leahy, political editor of The Irish Times newspaper.

He told RTE television that forming a government could prove “a very difficult exercise” unless parties compromised on their pre-election stances.

PM's future in the balance

Varadkar became Ireland's prime minister in June 2017 after an internal Fine Gael leadership contest. The party had been in power since 2011 under his predecessor Enda Kenny.

Saturday was Varadkar's first time facing voters at the polls as the prime minister, or taoiseach.

Just 41 years old, he is Ireland's first mixed-race and openly gay premier who has come to represent a more socially progressive nation after years of dominance by the Roman Catholic Church.

He plumped for an early election after successfully helping to broker a deal cushioning Britain's EU exit on January 31 by avoiding a hard border with Northern Ireland.

Varadkar's campaign was focused on Brexit — but did not seem to land with voters concerned with issues of healthcare, housing and homelessness.

In the Saturday exit poll just one per cent of respondents said Brexit was the key factor in how they voted.

Health ranked on 32% whilst the issue of housing and homelessness was on 26%.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/11shms/article30775639.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRELANDELECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ireland-national-elections-counting-of-votes-begin/article30775640.ece
57,2020/02/09,Death of whistleblower ignites calls for political reform in China,"The death of a whistleblowing doctor who was reprimanded for warning about the new coronavirus has sparked rare calls for political reform and free speech in China.

Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist in Wuhan — ground zero of China's virus epidemic which has killed more than 800 — succumbed to the disease on Friday over a month after he first raised alarm about the SARS-like virus.

He was among eight physicians punished by Wuhan police for “rumour-mongering”.

But after his death struck a collective nerve, a number of academics have spoken up to demand more freedoms in China.

At least two open letters demanding free speech have circulated on social media since the 34-year-old's death — one signed by 10 professors in Wuhan.

Li's efforts “vigorously maintained the interests of the country and society”, read that letter, which has since been censored on Weibo, China's Twitter-like social media site.

“Put an end to the restrictions on freedom of speech,” it demanded, and “openly apologise” to Li and the seven other doctors punished for discussing the emergence of the virus in December.

The other letter — signed on Friday by an anonymous group of alumni from the prestigious Tsinghua University in Beijing — called on authorities to “guarantee the constitutional rights of citizens”.

“Resolutely oppose making political security the top priority — that is an extremely selfish goal of a small organisation!” it said.

The letters are a rare call for political reform in China, a country where dissidents are often jailed and criticism of the government is quickly scrubbed.

Many references to the two letters had been removed from Weibo by Sunday.

'Law-breaking actions'

While the World Health Organization and other experts have heaped praise on China, saying it took decisive steps to try to contain the virus, critics say precious time was lost by early inaction from the local government.

Li — diagnosed with the virus on February 1 — said in a Weibo post in late January that local police had forced him to sign a statement agreeing not to commit any more “law-breaking actions”.

He said police had summoned him after he saw test results from some patients suggesting a SARS-like virus and reminded colleagues in a group chat to take stronger precautions.

Since his death, Beijing has sought to quell public anger by positioning the doctor as a hero.

Criticism is being deflected towards local authorities in Hubei province who are taking the bulk of public anger over the handling of the epidemic.

China's anti-graft watchdog announced Friday it was sending a team to Wuhan where it would investigate “issues involving Dr Li Wenliang reported by the masses”.

“It sends a clear message that the central authorities are determined to get to the truth and hold those responsible accountable,” said the state-run China Daily newspaper in an editorial on Friday.

Meanwhile Cui Tiankai, China's ambassador in the United States, said he was “really saddened” by the doctor's death.

“We are so grateful to him for what he has done in our joint efforts” fighting the virus, Cui tweeted.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/m79os9/article30775611.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LiWenliang,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/death-of-whistleblower-ignites-calls-for-political-reform-in-china/article30775612.ece
58,2020/02/09,6.2-magnitude earthquake hits Papua New Guinea,"A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck Papua New Guinea on Sunday, the US Geological Survey said, but no tsunami warning was issued and there were no immediate reports of damage.

The quake hit just after 4 p.m. local time (0600GMT) at a depth of 31 kilometres (19 miles) some 122 kilometres (75 miles) south of Kokopo, the capital of PNG's East New Britain province, the USGS said.

Geoscience Australia senior seismologist Trevor Allen said coastal communities near the epicentre would have felt “quite strong ground shaking” as the tremblor was close to the shore.

But, he said, the area was relatively sparsely populated and flexible building design locally helped limit exposure to damage from quakes.

“The East New Britain region is one of the most seismically active regions in the world and would generally tend to get an earthquake of this size once or twice a year,” he told AFP.

Miriam Koikoi, a receptionist at Kokopo Beach Bungalow Resort, told AFP the shaking was “not that big” and she had not seen any signs of damage.

PNG sits on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, which is a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.

Its mountainous and remote terrain means it often takes several days for information about damage from quakes to reach officials and aid agencies.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8xksfc/article30775411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kokopoJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/62-magnitude-earthquake-hits-papua-new-guinea/article30775413.ece
59,2020/02/09,Bangladesh scraps plans of bringing back stuck nationals from coronavirus-hit China,"Bangladesh has scrapped plans of bringing back 171 nationals stuck in coronavirus-hit China after it failed to arrange a flight following refusal from crew members to fly to the affected country, according to media reports on February 9.

State-run Biman Airlines’ Boeing 777-300 ER aircraft on February 1 brought back 312 Bangladeshis, including 12 children and three infants in the wake of the deadly coronavirus outbreak in China, that has claimed 811 lives and infected over 37,000 others.

We can’t send any flight. No crew member agreed to go there. So, we’ve told them [stranded Bangladeshis] to wait, Bangladesh Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen was quoted as saying by bdnews24.com.

The government has said that the number of Bangladeshis who wanted to return but could not be brought back is 171.

Mr. Momen also denied reports that some of the stuck Bangladeshi nationals have complained of shortage of food and drinking water due to the lockdown, saying that the Chinese authorities were providing food and water to the 23 places where the Bangladeshis stay.

He said that the Bangladesh Embassy in Beijing was maintaining regular contact with the stranded Bangladeshis.

According to a report in the Dhaka Tribune, the minister said that the government had spent a lot of time for those intending to return. “However, it is still not possible (to bring them back). The Biman crew members who brought back some 312 Bangladeshis from China are now in effect barred from flying to other countries,” he said.

He said that only a Chinese chartered flight could bring the Bangladeshi nationals back, the report said.

“Earlier, Chinese authorities agreed to do so, but later declined. We are not able to send any flights there,” he said.

According to the report, Mr. Momen made the comments days after Cabinet Secretary Khandker Anwarul Islam said that around 171 Bangladeshis would be flown out of Wuhan upon clearance from Chinese authorities.

The virus emerged in early December and has been traced to a market in Wuhan that sold wild animals.

The World Health Organisation has declared the outbreak a global emergency.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wz4a09/article30775308.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BANGLADESHCHINAOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bangladesh-scraps-plans-of-bringing-back-stuck-nationals-from-coronavirus-hit-china/article30775309.ece
60,2020/02/09,Thailand soldier kills 29 in rampage before being shot,"A soldier angry over a property deal gone sour killed at least 29 people and injured 57 in a rampage that spanned four locations in and around the northeastern Thai city of Nakhon Ratchasima before he was shot dead early on February 9.

Most of the victims were at the city's Terminal 21 shopping centre, where the shooter held out against an overnight siege with an assault rifle and ammunition stolen from his army base.

Police named him as 32-year-old soldier Jakrapanth Thomma. He initially posted written messages on Facebook during the attack before his account was shut down by the company.

“It was a personal conflict...over a house deal,” Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters on Sunday from Nakhon Ratchasima after travelling there to meet wounded survivors.

Prayuth added that the conflict was with a relative of the soldier's commanding officer.

Hundreds of shoppers fled the mall in groups crouching low, and the police and army launched several rescues during the more than 12-hour standoff, with armed forces at one point emerging at a run carrying small children.

“It was frightening because I could hear the occasional gunshot...we waited a long time for the police to come and help us, many hours,” said Suvanarat Jirattanasakul, 27, her voice trembling.

Another survivor told local Amarin TV that the shooter was ”aiming for the heads” and said his colleague died on the scene.

“He was shooting everywhere and his shots were very precise,” said the man, identified as “Diaw”.

At a morgue in Nakhon Ratchasima, the family of 13-year-old Ratchanon Karnchanamethee sobbed as they identified his body.

“He's my only son. He hasn't even had dinner,” said his father, Natthawut Karnchanamethee. “I allowed him to do anything he wanted to. I never set expectations for him. I only wanted him to be a good person.”

The province's governor, Wichien Chantaranochai, on Sunday night said a total of 29 people had been killed and 57 were wounded.

Also known by the historical name Korat, Nakhon Ratchasima has a population of about 250,000. It is close to a national park popular for its wild elephants but the relatively poor northeastern region is one of the less visited areas for Thailand's tens of millions of tourists.

Stolen arsenal

CCTV footage from inside the mall posted on social media showed the gunman dressed in black and wearing a mask, his gun slung over his shoulder with no sign of other people around.

According to local media, Jakrapanth worked at an army base close to Nakhon Ratchasima, which is about 250 km (155 miles) from the capital Bangkok.

He was a sharp shooter and took many special courses on carrying out attacks, including planning ambushes, army sources said. Thai media reported he often posted photos of weapons on social media.

The killings began at around 3 p.m. (0800 GMT) on Saturday when the soldier opened fire in a house before moving to an army camp and then driving to the mall in a stolen Humvee.

The soldier's commanding officer was one of the people reported killed before the soldier moved on to the shopping mall and began shooting.

At some point during the day, the soldier raided the army camp's weapons storage to arm himself, said Lt. General Thanya Kiatsarn, Commander of the Second Area Command.

“He attacked the guard to the weapon arsenal, who later died, and he stole an official jeep and an HK33 gun and an amount of ammunition to do what he did,” Thanya said.

'Spend the money in hell'

Hours before he began shooting on Saturday, Jakrapanth had posted on his Facebook account denouncing greedy people.

“Rich from cheating. Taking advantage of other people. Do they think they can spend the money in hell?” read one post in Thai.

He later posted written updates during the attack.

“Death is inevitable for everyone,” he wrote. Later, he complained about his fingers cramping and asked “Should I give up?” before the account was no longer available.

Hours after the mall siege began, Facebook said it had removed the suspect's account.

“There is no place on Facebook for people who commit this kind of atrocity, nor do we allow people to praise or support this attack,” a Facebook representative said in a statement.

61,2020/02/09,Switzerland votes on new law against homophobia,"Switzerland votes in a referendum on Sunday on a new law against homophobia that is opposed by the populist rightwing Swiss People’s Party (SVP).

The new law would widen existing legislation against discrimination or incitement to hatred on ethnic or religious grounds to include sexual orientation.

Campaigner Jean-Pierre Sigrist, founder of an association of gay teachers, said it might have stopped him getting beaten up outside a bar in Geneva four decades ago.

“And maybe I would not have been laughed at when I went to the police,” the 71-year-old told AFP.

The change was passed by the Swiss parliament in 2018 but critics, who believe it will end up censoring free speech, have forced a referendum on the issue.

Polls close at noon (1100 GMT) and results are expected in the early afternoon.

Eric Bertinat, an SVP local lawmaker in Geneva, told AFP that he believed the law was “part of an LGBT plan to slowly move towards same-sex marriage and medically assisted reproduction” for gay couples.

Marc Frueh, head of the Federal Democratic Union of Switzerland (EDU), a small party based on Christian values, has called it a “censorship law”.

But Mr. Sigrist said it would help counter growing levels of intolerance against gay people.

Mr. Sigrist said he supports freedom of expression, “but not the freedom to say anything at all”.

All of Switzerland’s major parties except the SVP, the biggest political force in parliament, support the law.

What the law says

Under the new law, homophobic comments made in a family setting or among friends would not be criminalised.

But publicly denigrating or discriminating against someone for being gay or inciting hatred against that person in text, speech, images or gestures, would be banned.

The government has said it will still be possible to have opinionated debates on issues such as same-sex marriage, and the new law does not ban jokes -- however off-colour.

“Incitement to hatred needs to reach a certain level of intensity in order to be considered criminal in Switzerland,” Alexandre Curchod, a media lawyer, told AFP.

But he admitted that there could be exceptions “if it can be shown that, under the cover of artistic production or joking, someone is in fact engaging in incitement”.

Gay rights campaigners are divided over the legislation.

A group called “No to Special Rights!” is opposed, arguing that the gay community does not need special protection.

Opinion polls show that the Swiss as a whole are broadly in favour of the law, but that the margin between supporters and opponents has narrowed in recent months.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yhw6wa/article30775138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SWIDSSFLAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/switzerland-votes-on-new-law-against-homophobia/article30775139.ece
62,2020/02/09,Afghan soldier kills two American soldiers,"Two U.S. service members were killed and six others injured when an individual in an Afghan uniform opened fire on them with a machine gun in eastern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said on Saturday.

The incident, which took place in Nangarhar province, occurred after a combined U.S. and Afghan force completed a ”key-leader engagement,” Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in a statement. “We are still collecting information and the cause or motive behind the attack is unknown at this time.”

Mubariz Khadem, a senior security official in Nangarhar province, told Reuters earlier on Saturday that clashes took place between U.S. and Afghan forces and casualties were feared. Insider attacks, often known as “green-on-blue” attacks, have been a regular feature of the conflict in Afghanistan, although their frequency has diminished in recent years.

Nangarhar, which shares a long and porous border with neighboring Pakistan, had long served as the main stronghold of Islamic State, from where militants planned and staged bombings around the country, especially the capital Kabul.

The Taliban has also controlled parts of Nangarhar province.

About 13,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Afghanistan as part of the U.S.-led NATO mission to train, assist and advise Afghan forces and to carry out counter-terrorism operations.

The incident comes at a delicate time, as U.S. diplomats have been talking with the Taliban for months to agree a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces in exchange for security guarantees.

63,2020/02/09,"Bushfires, cyclone, torrential rain hit Australia's coasts","Severe bushfires burned through parts of Western Australia on Sunday, with other areas of the state dealing with the aftermath of a powerful cyclone, while the country's east coast was facing potential life-threatening flash flooding.

After months of destructive wildfires that have razed millions of hectares of land, Australia has been hit in recent weeks by wild weather that has alternately brought heavy downpours, hail storms, gusty winds and hot and dry air.

About a dozen fires were burning in Western Australia on Sunday, with severe fire danger expected in several districts, according to fire services and the state's Bureau of Meteorology.

Daytime temperatures in some of the districts were forecast at up to 42 degrees Celsius.

The State's upper parts were battling on Sunday the aftermath of a tropical cyclone Damien that made a landfall on Saturday afternoon, bringing gusty winds of up to 200 km per hour. No immediate damages were reported and the cyclone was expected to weaken as it moved inland, but winds were seen to blow at more than 100 kph.

“Although Tropical #CycloneDamien has weakened significantly from the thrashing it gave Karratha and Dampier yesterday, areas around Tom Price and Paraburdoo are receiving significant rainfall and squally conditions,” the state's Bureau of Meteorology said on its Twitter account.

On the opposite coast of Australia, Sydney and the state of New South Wales were in danger of potential life-threatening flash flooding as rain kept bucketing down for a third day in a row in downpours not seen since 1998.

Rainfall in some parts of the state approached half the annual average, but the falls were welcomed after the state saw its driest year on record in 2019, at 55% below average.

The state's Bureau of Meteorology said there was potential for heavy “rainfall and life-threatening flash-flooding,” and coast erosion, although little danger of river flooding as water levels have been low due to a persistent drought.

In Queensland, meteorologists also warned of flash and riverine flooding on Sunday, following heavy falls overnight. An emergency flood alert was issued for residents of Dalby due to a creek overflowing, some 200 km west of Brisbane.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/325jpr/article30774930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bushfires-cyclone-torrential-rain-hit-australias-coasts/article30774931.ece

A man and a woman are suspected of “operating dozens of fake news portals and linked Facebook pages” claiming that several people have been infected and died from coronavirus, said a statement on the police website.

The sites, whose articles carried sensational headlines, were aimed at increasing traffic and boosting advertisement revenue, said the police.

66,2020/02/09,"Coronavirus: China deaths rise past 800, overtaking SARS toll","The death toll from the novel coronavirus outbreak soared to 803 in China on Sunday, according to official figures, overtaking the global toll for SARS.

With 81 more people dying in Hubei — the province at the centre of the outbreak — the toll is now higher than the 774 killed worldwide by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2002-2003, according to figures released Sunday.

The latest data came after the World Health Organisation said numbers were “stabilising” — but warned it was too early to make any predictions about whether the virus might have peaked.

Nearly 37,000 people have now been infected by the new coronavirus in China, believed to have emerged last year in a market that sold wild animals in Hubei's capital Wuhan before spreading across China.

The epidemic has prompted the government to lock down whole cities, as anger mounts over its handling of the crisis, especially after a whistleblowing doctor fell victim to the virus.

A 60-year-old American diagnosed with the virus died on Thursday in Wuhan, according to the U.S. embassy, which gave no further details on the victim.

China's foreign ministry said in a statement to AFP that the victim was a U.S. citizen of Chinese origin.

A Japanese man in his 60s with a suspected coronavirus infection also died in hospital in Wuhan, the Japanese foreign ministry said, adding that it was “difficult” to confirm if he had the illness.

The only fatalities outside the mainland were a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong.

Numbers 'stabilising'

In Geneva, the World Health Organization said that the number of cases being reported daily in China is “stabilising”.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus also warned against misinformation about the virus, saying it made the work of healthcare staff harder.

“We're not just battling the virus, we're also battling the trolls and conspiracy theorists that push misinformation and undermine the outbreak response,” he said.

Fearing that the virus could cause an economic slowdown in China — the world's leading oil importer and consumer — a committee appointed by the OPEC club of petroleum producing countries recommended cuts in oil output.

“The coronavirus epidemic has had a negative impact on economic activity, notably in transport, tourism and industry, particularly in China,” Mohamed Arkab, president of the conference of OPEC, said in a statement.

Hong Kong quarantine

Hong Kong began enforcing a two-week quarantine for anyone arriving from mainland China on Saturday, under threat of both fines and jail terms.

Most people will be able to be quarantined at home or in hotels but they will face daily phone calls and spot checks.

The financial hub has 25 confirmed cases with one patient who died earlier this week.

The virus has revived memories of the SARS outbreak that killed 299 in the semi-autonomous city, saddling residents with a deep distrust of authorities in Beijing who initially covered up the outbreak.

In the last week, Hong Kong has been hit by a wave of panic-buying with supermarket shelves frequently emptied of staple goods such as toilet paper, hand sanitiser, rice and pasta.

Similar scenes were seen in Singapore on Saturday as shoppers cleared grocery store shelves after the city-state, which has 33 confirmed cases, raised its alert level over the virus.

China has expanded its own measures, with cities far from Hubei telling residents that only one person per household can leave the house every two days to buy supplies.

On Saturday, Shanghai became the latest jurisdiction to order residents to wear masks in public places, warning that those who don't cooperate will be “seriously” dealt with according to the law.

Anger over the government's handling of the health emergency erupted on social media after the death of a Wuhan doctor who police silenced after he had raised the alarm about the emerging virus threat in December.

The government responded by sending its anti-graft body to Wuhan to launch an investigation after the death of Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist who contracted the disease while treating a patient.

Cruise ship quarantined

Other governments have hardened their defences, with several countries banning arrivals from China while major airlines have suspended flights.

New cases have emerged abroad, with five British nationals, including a child, testing positive for the virus after staying at the same ski chalet in France.

Asian cruise ships have become a focal point.

Prime Minister Leo Varadkar’s incumbent Fine Gael party, centre-right rivals Fianna Fail and left-wingers Sinn Fein all received 22% of first preference votes, according to the PSOS MRBI poll issued as the polling stations closed at 2200 GMT.

The survey of around 5,000 voters leaving the polls — which has an estimated margin of error of 1.3% — put Fine Gael on 22.4%, Sinn Fein on 22.3% and Fianna Fail on 22.2%.

The Republic of Ireland uses a single transferable vote system to elect multiple deputies from each of the 39 constituencies, making it hard to extrapolate a likely seat forecast from the exit poll figures for first preference votes.

The count gets under way at 0900 GMT on February 9.

“We’ve never seen a general election result like it,” said Pat Leahy, political editor of The Irish Times newspaper.

“Basically a statistical tie between what are now the three big parties. Government formation is going to be a very difficult exercise indeed if the parties maintain their pre-election positions,” he told RTE television.

As a prelude to preparing a dossier for submitting its nomination, the Town and Country Planning Department, in association with the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), held a conference “Road to Unesco nomination” at the Chief Secretariat.

Besides Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar, Unesco director Eric Falt, and Town and Country Planning secretary Mahesh Kumar and architect Rabindra Vasavada, who was involved in obtaining heritage status for Ahmedabad city, participated in the deliberations.

Interacting with reporters after the conference, the Chief Secretary said the administration had decided to take it as a challenge to get the region listed as world heritage site. “The conference is a beginning and it is a long drawn process. Creating an inventory of sites and places to include in the dossier is the next process,” he said.

Success of the initiative depended on the constructive involvement of public, Mr. Kumar said.

According to an official, the region had achieved three milestones to achieve the status. The government had undertaken regulatory works to protect heritage sites and precincts. INTACH had prepared a complete list of heritage buildings in the boulevard which was being vetted by the government.

After the Heritage Committee and government approved the listed heritage buildings, the list would be published for public feedback and consultation. People would be given a month’s time to share their suggestions. The next step would be to prepare a detailed dossier to fulfil the Unesco conditions for Puducherry World Heritage City, the official added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/fwfchq/article30772640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THPONDYUNESCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/ut-to-seek-world-heritage-tag/article30772641.ece
70,2020/02/09,Plan Campaign review may address systemic shortfalls,"As the government gears up for a review of the People’s Plan Campaign that heralded conspicuous changes in decentralised planning, governance and development, the scrutiny is likely to evolve a system for addressing its systemic shortcomings too.

The Budget announcement that the campaign needs to be reviewed in its silver jubilee year has evoked much curiosity. For, it comes at a time when local self-government institutions are playing a pivotal role in delivering key services at the regional level and also handling a lion’s share of the Plan funds for development and other purposes.

The Kerala model in devolution of funds, functions and functionaries to the LSGIs has been hailed as the best model worth emulating. But a course correction has become imperative considering the dwindling mass participation in the programmes and projects worked out as part of the campaign. This is more obvious in the urban local bodies where local participation is rather nil in ward sabhas that form the base for shaping up projects in tune with the local needs.

The poor stakeholder participation in the planning process was the first lacuna that cries for urgent attention, sources akin to the process said.

Earlier attempts made by various agencies for training elected members and others for increasing the mass base do not seem to have yielded the desired results. A drastic increase in public participation in each locale is key to making the planning process a success.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac, in his Budget speech, had said each local body would have to prepare a comprehensive progress report as envisaged in the Development Report of 1996 that laid the rules of the game before launching the campaign. He also proposed to constitute working groups for preparing the report in May.

Other than mass participation, absorption of funds, quality of projects prepared and executed by LSGIs during the past 25 years, functioning of elected members and such other issues should come up for review.

Since local body elections are round the corner, whether the incumbents would have the time and enthusiasm for taking up such a daunting task is what remains to be seen.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/plan-campaign-review-may-address-systemic-shortfalls/article30776358.ece
71,2020/02/09,Kerala Budget 2020 | Mixed reactions in Thiruvananthapuram,"The State Budget has evoked a mixed reaction from people from various walks of life in the capital. While many rued that the government neglected several burning issues in the district, some others came to its defence to claim that several budgetary allocations would go a long way in strengthening the existing public amenities.

Residents’ associations in the capital city decried the lack of steps to enhance public transportation facilities. “While the government had made promises to develop a light metro and construct flyovers at Sreekaryam, Ulloor and Pattom for the purpose, no budgetary allocation has been made for the project,” M.S. Venugopal, chairman of the Federation of Residents’ Associations, said.

He said there was a need to address the looming crisis the city faced owing to an inadequate waste management system. “While several households have managed to adopt the source-level disposal system, the city Corporation has failed to address the wastes accumulated by auditoriums and commercial establishments, most of which were dumped in waterbodies or drainages. The government’s plan to beautify roads at a cost of ₹25 crore is not the need of the hour. The district has been largely neglected,” he said.

District Congress Committee president Neyyattinkara Sanal accused the government of showing scant regard for the State capital. He alleged that several ambitious projects, including the Attukal township project, that were announced earlier remained just on paper. Besides, several projects that fast-progressed during the United Democratic Front rule had been stalled since the Left Democratic Front came into power. The agrarian sector had also been neglected. The party would organise a district-wide rally from February 19 in protest against the alleged neglect towards the district, he said.

Echoing the views, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) district president V.V. Rajesh said the LDF had held an ignorant attitude towards the needs of the district. Traffic congestion continued to remain a headache for its residents. The government failed to ensure a proportionate development of road infrastructure in the city’s suburbs and other rural areas. Yet another problem of waste management continued to affect normal life in various parts of the district. The party took out a demonstration to the Secretariat on Saturday on the issue.

Counter view

Dismissing such claims, Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] district secretary Anavoor Nagappan said they were nothing but propaganda aimed at political gains. “The capital district has received a special focus throughout the LDF rule. The Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital has been witnessing works worth ₹800 crore. Besides, the government has ensured the construction of 39,000 houses in Thiruvananthapuram, the highest in the State, under the LIFE Mission. Both Kattakada and Vattiyurkavu are set for a major uplift with the unprecedented allocations for infrastructure development,” he said.

He alleged that those who criticised the State government had misled the district in the past by making hollow promises including establishing a railway medical college as well as a coaching terminal at Nemom.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/2i8lru/article30773082.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09TVTVBUDGET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/budget-evokes-mixed-reactions/article30773083.ece

73,2020/02/09,Short films made by film clubs of high school students to be screened,"Students of film clubs in 40 high schools in the district will exhibit short films made by them at a film festival that will begin here on Wednesday.

The films have been made as part of ‘Celluloid’, a district panchayat project that is being implemented by the District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) in these 40 schools.

The goal of ‘Celluloid’ is to use cinema as a tool for studies in Classes 8 to 10.

Important medium

Cinema is also seen as a important medium for cultural development of students and for kindling the value of humaneness in them.

The scripts for the short films are based on themes in the students’ textbooks, says DIET senior lecturer A. Mohammed Kabir who is the coordinator of the programme.

Training

A residential training programme in filmmaking was organised in two phases for two students of the film club of each school and the teacher in-charge of the club at the Agricultural Cooperative Training Centre at Manvila.

Experienced names in the fields of direction, acting, and cinematography led the training. Following the training, the students and their teachers got down to making films of 10-minute duration in their schools.

The films made by them will be screened at a two-day film festival at the district panchayat’s EMS Memorial Hall from Wednesday.

Best eight films

The best eight films at the festival will be given awards. Awards would also be presented to two best actors and two best actresses on the occasion, Mr. Mohammed Kabir said.

Inaugurating the event, Soorya Krishnamoorthy said children even in the remotest rural areas in Kerala were going to school with ties around their neck and reciting English rhymes easily while they were ignorant of Malayalam folk tales and characters and the illustrious authors behind the works.

Tapasya State president Madambu Kunhikuttan who chaired the function said it was important to delve into history beyond the Mughal and British era to understand India.

Noted music director Ramani Bharadwaj who was the chief guest noted that Indian culture was rooted in diversity.

In his keynote address, former chairman, Kalamandalam Prabodhachandran Nair criticised the State government for turning its back on the assistance offered by the Centre for promoting Malayalam as a classical language.

76,2020/02/09,Kerala prepares ‘elder budget’ for next fiscal,"The State government has prepared an ‘elder’ budget this year. It includes programmes for geriatric welfare that are spread across various departments.

Local self-government institutions should earmark ₹290 crore from their Plan fund for the elderly, it said.

The Sayamprabha scheme of the Social Justice Department under which model day care centres for the elderly will be set up has been allocated ₹6.5 crore.

An amount of ₹24 crore has been earmarked for the Vayomithram project that ensures comprehensive health care and support for the elderly above the age of 65.

Day care

One ‘Pakal Veedu’ (day care centres) for every two or three wards should be set up. Existing libraries or rented houses can be used for this scheme to doyble up as the day care centres.

The nearly 25,000-strong Kudumbashree elderly neighborhood groups should be associated with these centres.

Differently abled

The Budget has an outlay of ₹500 crore for projects for the differently abled.

An amount of ₹50 crore has been earmarked for schemes such as ‘Anuyatra’ (comprehensive approach to disability managment), ‘Sruthitharangam’ (cochlear implantation scheme), and ‘Aarogya Kiranam’ (free medical care up to the age of 18) for the differently abled.

77,2020/02/09,4 POCSO fast-track courts in Thiruvananthapuram district,"The Thiruvananthapuram district will get four fast-track special courts to handle cases exclusively registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

The district has the maximum number of such cases among all districts. The Social Justice Department had issued orders sanctioning 28 such courts in the State to clear the pending cases booked under the POCSO Act, Minister for Women and Child Development K.K. Shylaja said.

The Minister said the State government had decided to set up the special courts to secure deserving punishment for the accused against the backdrop of the increase in sexual crimes against children and to make courts child-friendly.

On the State government’s request, the Union Ministry of Law and Justice had a couple of months ago given the nod for setting up the fast-track courts.

Following this, the State government had put the finishing touches and given the sanction, she said, adding that the Kerala High Court, the Law department, and the Home department, led by the Women and Child Development Department, would together implement the project.

Besides the four courts in Thiruvananthapuram district, three each will be set up in Thrissur and Malappuram districts, two each in Kollam, Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam, Palakkad, Kozhikode, and Kannur, and one each in the remaining districts.

Funds needed

An amount of ₹75 lakh will be required to set up each court, taking the total to ₹21 crore.

While the Union government share will be 60%, the State government will meet the remaining 40%.

Each court will handle at least 165 cases a year.

They will function from premises taken on lease or rent.

Each court will have one judicial officer and staff members – that is a District and Sessions Judge, special prosecutor, senior clerk, bench clerk, confidential assistant, computer assistant and office attendant.

As per statistics from the High Court, there are 12,234 rape cases and those booked under the POCSO Act.

79,2020/02/09,Indian Super League | Rowlin Borges keen to deliver in front of home fans in Goa,"FC Goa is in the news after the sudden sacking of chief coach Sergio Lobera by the management, sans any explanation for a drastic decision.

Local fans expressed displeasure on TV channels in Goa at the shock exit of their favourite coach at a time when their favourite club was on top of the Indian Super League (ISL) season six standings then.

The players also admitted to being caught by surprise, but put the controversy behind in a 4-1 rout of Hyderabad FC at home and confirmed a semifinal berth — Goa is second behind ATK currently.

With the Lobera issue still a talking point in the ISL, Goa will host Mumbai City FC at the Nehru Stadium (Margao) on February 12. Interestingly, a key player in the visitor’s line-up, under coach Jorge Costa, is Goa-born Rowlin Borges, whose career took off at Sporting Club de Goa before ISL clubs came calling.

Emotional fans

The 27-year-old India international faces the prospect of playing inside a stadium packed with emotional fans rooting for FC Goa, now managed by Technical Director Derrick Pereira.

Borges appreciates the Goans’ support for the home club and realises that overflowing fan emotions can be a factor against the visiting team, but is undeterred.

“It does not matter if I am playing in a packed stadium on empty one. I have to give my best for my team, winning is the most important thing,” he said on the sidelines of a kids clinic for Adidas at Turfpark, St. Andrew’s HS ground, Bandra.

Familiar with the Goan passion for football, he expressed surprise for the open display of support for the sacked coach from Spain. Fans were shown on local TV channels shouting slogans in support of Lobera at the airport, and the midfielder remarked: “I have not seen anything like this before in Goa. It shows the love for the coach from the fans. It is a good thing they are also giving credit to a coach for what he has done with FC Goa.”

Borges is eager to deliver at the Nehru stadium, because his family and friends will be in the stands. He does not know if they will cheer for him or roar for FC Goa, but the renewed interest for football in Goans is applauded.

Huge fan base

“The fan base of FC Goa is very huge. It is like a family, they come to cheer every home match,” he said, adding: “Almost every Goan is happy as their team is doing well in the league and are enjoy the FC Goa’s style of football.”

He is clear about what Costa expects from his team. “We are supposed to press (the opponent team) hard, win the ball and if we can retain possession, try to do it.”

Mumbai City faces a must-win game against FC Goa in the race for a semifinals berth. For Borges, a top-four finish will put him in good form when the Indian national camp resumes next month for a World Cup qualifier against Qatar, the best team in Asia.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/5jleeh/article30776065.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10BORGES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/borges-keen-to-deliver-in-front-of-home-fans/article30776066.ece
80,2020/02/09,Indian Super League | Chennaiyin has the chance to reach top four,"Chennaiyin FC has managed a remarkable turnaround in its fortunes winning its last four games and now has a realistic chance of making the top four. This seemed impossible not too long ago.

On Sunday, it will host defending champion Bengaluru FC in its final home match of the season. With its big win 6-3 win over Kerala Blasters FC in Kochi last week, CFC is brimming with confidence.

Boost in confidence

The home team has managed to score 15 goals in its last four matches and it should give the team a huge boost in confidence against a formidable side like BFC.

But unlike the previous games, BFC will be a tougher opponent as it is defensively the best side in the competition. CFC will miss the services of Anirudh Thapa (suspension) and Germanpreet Singh is a doubtful starter.

Coach Owen Coyle who is aware of that said: “They are a strong, physical team that defends well. To win the game, we have to play very well offensively but we do know that we have to do better defensively too. We respect the champions but do not fear them.”

For CFC — currently fifth in the table with 21 points from 14 games — it will be important to pocket three points to stay in the fight with Mumbai for the fourth place.

With 28 points from 15 matches, BFC is comfortably placed third, ahead of Mumbai City FC on 26 from 16 games.

BFC comes into the game on the back of two wins but would want to get on board first on Sunday considering its three defeats have come when it has conceded a goal first while CFC has never lost after taking the lead this season.

BFC coach Carles Cuadrat said, “It’s clear that the new coach has been getting them to believe more in the creative process. They have become a team who score a lot of goals. We will try to score first but we know it is not going to be easy.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/uzezcq/article30774947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH09CFC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/indian-super-league-chennaiyin-has-the-chance-to-reach-top-four/article30774948.ece
81,2020/02/09,Leverkusen beats Dortmund 4-3 after late comeback,"Bayer Leverkusen scored two late goals to beat Borussia Dortmund 4-3 on February 8 and deal a blow to Dortmund’s ambitions of winning the German title.

Kevin Volland scored twice for Leverkusen early on, but it was substitute Leon Bailey who secured the win, scoring off Volland’s assist for 3-3. A minute later the Jamaican’s backheel pass fed Daley Sinkgraven to send in the cross for Lars Bender to head in the winning goal.

A win would have brought Dortmund level on points with leader and defending champion Bayern Munich. Dortmund now could end the weekend six points off the top if Bayern beats Leipzig on Sunday.

Leverkusen closed to two points off the Champions League places.

Volland gave Leverkusen the lead off a pass from Nadiem Amiri in the 20th minute, but the advantage lasted just two minutes as Mats Hummels headed in off Jadon Sancho’s corner.

Sancho has assisted a goal in all four of Dortmund’s league games in 2020, and the England winger has set up a league-leading 14 this season.

On his league debut for Dortmund since arriving from Juventus last week, midfielder Emre Can hit a majestic curling shot from 20 yards to give his new team a 2-1 lead.

Then it was Leverkusen’s turn to level the score with Volland’s volley at a corner.

Volland has had a largely quiet season, but he’s stepped up against the title contenders, scoring against Leipzig and Borussia Munchengladbach, and recording two assists against Bayern.

Both teams wasted excellent chances to score due to mistakes by talented young players. Sancho put the ball in the net for Dortmund after an elegant combination with Achraf Hakimi but a VAR review spotted an unnecessary foul off the ball by 17-year-old American Gio Reyna in the buildup.

Soon after, Leverkusen’s 20-year-old star Kai Havertz ignored teammate Moussa Diaby in space on a breakaway and instead fired a shot against the post, leaving Diaby visibly frustrated.

Barely a minute and a half later Dortmund snatched the lead. The two full backs combined as Hakimi cut in from the right flank to spot Raphael Guerreiro arriving at the far post to apply the finish and put Dortmund 3-2 up. Leverkusen coach Peter Bosz’s response was to send on Bailey, sparking the fightback for the 4-3 win.

Erling Haaland failed to score for the first time since joining Dortmund from Salzburg. The Norwegian striker scored eight in his previous four games.

Dortmund has conceded seven goals in two games this week after losing to Werder Bremen 3-2 in the German Cup. Can said Dortmund needed to get better at defending a lead.

Of his goal, Can said- “It means nothing if we’ve lost.”

Schalke fall

Schalke dropped behind Leverkusen to sixth after drawing with last-placed Paderborn 1-1.

Jürgen Klinsmann’s Hertha Berlin continued to slide toward the relegation zone, finishing with 10 men in losing to Mainz 3-1 as Robin Quaison scored a hat trick. Hertha’s Marius Wolf was sent off late when his raised arm made contact with an opponent.

Elsewhere, Freiburg beat Hoffenheim 1-0 on a penalty from Luca Waldschmidt.

Promoted Union Berlin rose to 11th with a 2-0 win over Werder Berlin, which dropped back into the relegation zone in 17th.

84,2020/02/09,Widening of Nagapattinam-Thanjavur section of National Highway 67 remains at a standstill,"Seeking to end the stalemate in widening of the Nagapattinam-Thanjavur section of National Highway 67, a delegation from the delta region has apprised Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways on the pathetic condition of the road.

The delegation, comprising representatives of Tiruvarur Development Advisory Council, also urged the Minister to take steps to make the road a four-lane highway as planned originally and expedite the project. Led by M. Selvaraj, Member of Parliament, Nagapattinam, the delegation called on Minister Nitin Gadkari in New Delhi to brief him on the ground situation.

The incomplete works on the widening of the Nagapattinam-Thanjavur section of the highway has been a major irritant faced by residents of Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur and Thanjavur districts and also tourists visiting the region. The project, sanctioned at an estimated cost of ₹396 crore, to strengthen the road as a two-way highway with paved shoulders, remains incomplete for several years now, despite several agitations by the people.

The poor condition of the road at several stretches make for back-breaking ride for thousands of commuters and tourists.

Work on widening this stretch for a total length of 78.53 km should have been completed by the end of 2017 itself. With the stretch being full of curves and criss-crossing watercourses, widening of the road is considered vital to improving road safety and checking accidents.

“The Thanjavur-Nagapattinam road was originally planned to be made into a four-lane highway and National Highways Authority of India had even acquired the required lands eight years back. But the proposal was subsequently changed as an extended two-lane road. Even this work has not been completed, several years after the work commenced,” said S. Ravichandran, president; P.Senthil, secretary, and K. Arungandhi, treasurer, respectively, of Tiruvarur Development Advisory Council, in the representation, conveying the plight of the people of the delta region.

Mr. Selvaraj, while endorsing the representations made by the council and various other organisations of the delta region, requested the Minister to accord priority in addressing the grievance of the region. In the absence of proper road connectivity, big hospitals were hesitating to establish full-fledged facilities in the region, he contended.

Had there been good road connectivity, the region could also emerge as a major religious tourism circuit in Southern India as important and historic temples, mosques and churches were located in the delta, he said.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr.Senthil said the Minister gave them a patient hearing and promised positive action soon.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/588xd7/article30774602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09TYDELTA-HIGHWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/nagapattinam-thanjavur-highway-improvement-work-at-a-standstill/article30774603.ece

86,2020/02/09,‘Fact-checking must in this age of information explosion’,"The significance of fact-checking was highlighted at a two-day workshop on cybersecurity, online verification and fact-checking organised by the Department of Media and Communication of the Central University of Tamil Nadu (CUTN) in collaboration with Google News Initiative.

Inaugurating the workshop on the CUTN campus on Thursday, Vice-Chancellor A.P.

94,2020/02/09,No ‘room’ for tourists,"Tourist footfall in Visakhapatnam has seen a drastic increase in 2019 compared with the previous years. There is also a rise of 40% in foreign tourists over the previous year. But does the coastal city have adequate rooms for its visitors. The tourism officials say ‘no’.

Though the present availability of rooms is sufficient during normal days, the demand for the rooms, especially in small-scale/non-star hotels or budget hotels is high during the peak tourism season, which ranges from October to January.

According to Divisional Manager, APTDC, T.G. Prasad Reddy the number of rooms available in star hotels is around 1,600, while the rooms in the non-star hotels is about 2,000. Admitting that there is a shortage of rooms during peak tourism season, Mr. Reddy said that the demand is almost double sometimes. He said that nearly 1,000 rooms of all types were under construction stage and they are likely to be open for public from December 2020, he said.

""Apart from all these, if the capital shifts to Vizag, then the demand of rooms (all types) increase by 20% in Vizag city alone. Because it would not be just tourists alone who would be coming to the city, but also include officials and people with some work,"" he said.

The Tours and Travels Association president K. Vijaya Mohan opined that there was a need for premier hotels for conventions, seminars, conferences. However we see that many hotels already started to expand their branches, he said.

Mr. Reddy said that most of the domestic tourists were from West Bengal and Odisha. He said pristine beaches, tourism promotions through local events had been bearing fruit.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/no-room-for-tourists/article30777767.ece
95,2020/02/09,Tourist flow could be a threat to environment,"As the debate to make Visakhapatnam as the Executive capital rages, environmentalists and tribal organisations fear that the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam district and some prominent tourist spots in the city will see a sudden rise in tourist footfall. Environmentalists also bat for a sustainable policy for tourism development in the region.

Environmentalists say that there has been a rapid increase in the number of tourists coming from various parts to Visakhapatnam Agency in the last few years. Thousands of tourist have been flocking Araku, Borra Caves, Paderu, Chintapalle, Lambasingi and Chaparai for the past couple of years. However, the steps being taken by the government to tackle pollution issue are inadequate, they allege.

Dumping waste

""A visit to Lambasingi, Borra caves, Kothapalle, Chaparai will make one understand how the tourist spots have been damaged. Tourists have been dumping food waste, liquor bottles and plastic waste, which is a serious concern.

Local tribal people are facing a huge problem with the dumping of waste on the roads and farm fields,"" said Killo Surendra, president of Andhra Pradesh Girijana Sangham.

K. Bhanumathi from Dhaatri NGO said they had been continuously writing to the government to come up with some sustainable policy with clear environment regulations and Acts. ""This is completely irresponsible tourism, and ecotourism has no definition over here. In various parts such as Lambasingi, Kothapalle and many others, social security problems, environment problems have increased due to mass tourism and lack of proper government policies,"" she said.

Ms. Bhanumathi pointed out that none of the areas in the Agency had been following proper waste management techniques. If the capital city becomes a reality, then there would definitely be a hike in tourist footfall. With the government policies being inadequate, lack of proper solid waste management techniques and infrastructure, this could be a severe threat to the environment,"" she added.

Plastic ban

Officials from Integrated Tribal Development Authority (ITDA) said they had been implementing plastic ban in Araku since last year. However, restricting water packets is a major issue to deal, as tourists bring them from other places. ""If we restrict water sachets, we should be able to provide drinking water facility at all the tourist spots for which there are no funds at present,"" an official from ITDA said.

Many residents living close to the city beaches such as Rushikonda and Bheemunipatnam also have been facing problem from tipsy tourists. We have lodged several complaints with the police, but the police say that due to shortage of manpower, they are unable organise intensive patrolling along the Beach Road stretch from RK Beach to Bheemunipatnam, said a resident of Sagar Nagar.

However, a senior police officer said that things could be sorted out if the government cleared the tourism police station proposal.

Security

Senior police officer said that most of the tourist spots were being maintained by private security agencies, who appoint guards to deal with tipsy tourists and also to check sanitation issue.""Being a Maoist-prone area, we cannot be present in uniform at most of the spots. It is the responsibility of the private agencies to take care of the menace,"" the police officer said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/nhi89g/article30777762.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/193364685col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/tourist-flow-could-be-a-threat-to-environment/article30777764.ece

98,2020/02/09,Turning waste into wealth,"Aiming to reduce the waste right at the source or at the households and also to create awareness about environment-friendly methods, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) has been encouraging home composting methods among the citizens in the city. Moreover, what might be a great boost to the civic body for the Swachh Survekshan 2020 survey is that nearly 30,000 women working with various Self Help Groups (SHGs) have taken up the home composting method in their houses till date.

Last year, the Urban Community Development (UCD) wing of the civic body has taken an assurance from the SHGs associated with the GVMC to take up home composting and encourage source segregation in their localities. Now, most of the SHGs have not just adopted the environment-friendly method, but have also started to organise camps in their colonies over composting and their benefits.

“Gardening work has been my hobby for the last 20 years. Earlier I used fertilizers for the plants and vegetables which I would grow at my house. Four months ago, after coming to know about the composting method through the classes of SHGs, I started to prepare compost on my own,” said K. Subbamma, a resident of Shivajipalem area.

Ms. Subbamma, who maintains a dedicated garden on terrace of her house, has now a huge collection of vegetables and flowers. She says that the compost which is being prepared by wastes from home are giving good results.

“I am able to grow green mirchi, brinjals, tomatoes and many several other leafy vegetables. The results are very effective and the compost prepared in home gives good taste to the vegetables, as there is no use of pesticide at all,” she added.

Another homemaker and SHG member P. Vijaya Lakshmi said that she is preparing compost with food remains including rice, vegetables, tea powder (removing water content), egg shells, flowers and dry leaves.

“Earlier we used to have two to two-and-half kg wet wastes generated daily, but now nothing is being given to the GVMC staff in the morning. We are using it for our own garden. We are growing carrot, tomato, mustard, brinjal, flowers and even medicinal plants,” said Ms. Lakshmi.

A homemaker, G. Swathi from Midhilapuri Colony, Madhurwada, said that adopting home composting method is not just financially helping her family, but it has also given her some good hobby as she is able to spend some good time in garden daily.

“In Shivajipalem area itself, around 400 women have taken up home composting method and the results are very good. We are conducting at least two classes per month in localities. If any homemakers are interested, they are reaching us and we are training them,” said K. Punyavathi, Coordinator for SHGs, Shivajipalem.

Source segregation

Project Director, UCD, GVMC, Y. Srinivasa Rao, said that after Ms G. Srijana took charge as the GVMC Commissioner, the civic body is giving importance to source segregation and home composting methods.

“Last year, around 450 persons were making compost on their own in houses. Now over 30,000 people have taken up the idea and the results are effective. Our ultimate goal is to take up environment-friendly method and also to reduce wastes right at houses,” he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/s8oeb5/article30772881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09-VZ-HOMECOMPOST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/turning-waste-into-wealth/article30772882.ece

R. Venkataramani

A. Under the Income Tax Act, charging section under income from house property is triggered only when the assessee is the owner of the property consisting of any building or land appurtenant thereto. In your case, though the building was built by you using your funds and borrowed funds, you are not the owner of the house property and section 24 on“interest deductions” shall not be triggered. Therefore, interest and principal cannot be claimed unless you are the owner of the property at the time of construction.

Q. I am investing ₹60,000 a year under NPS voluntarily. Can I claim this amount under Sec. 80 CCD (1B) for tax relief? I have exhausted 80C benefit of ₹1.5 lakh through other means ( PF, PPF, home loan principal).

Under 80CCD(1B) of the Income Tax Act, any individual making a voluntary contribution to the prescribed pension fund/scheme shall be allowed deduction up to ₹50,000; this is in addition to the deduction the assessee can claim through the contribution made by the employer towards NPS under Section 80CCD(2). This deduction is available up to 10% of the salary; in your case, additional deduction of up to ₹50,000 over and above ₹1,50,000 under 80C can be availed.

Q. I am a senior citizen having a combined medical insurance policy with my wife. She is 58 years old. My auditor says I am eligible for a deduction of ₹25,000 only as my wife is not a senior citizen. He explains if both are senior citizens, only I am eligible for ₹50,000. (My wife is also an assessee but not claiming any deduction under Sec. 80 D)

I request you to let me know whether any safe scheme is available now for investment

A. In order to reduce any long-term capital gains tax arising from sale of house property, the proceeds from such sale must be invested in any/all avenues as mentioned below

1. Investment in prescribed bonds to be done within six months, of up to ₹50 lakh (not eligible in your case).

101,2020/02/09,"Gold, silver prices remain within range","After a strong start to the month, the price of precious metals was confined to a range during the best part of January 2020. The concerns pertaining to the coronavirus played a role in bolstering sentiment towards the precious metals.

Though concerns over the U.S.-China trade war were addressed to an extent by the signing of a trade deal between the two in mid-January, this had little impact on prices of the precious metals. Comex gold rose about 4.2% in January to $1,587.9 an ounce. Comex Silver rose 0.5% to settle at $18.01 an ounce.

In the domestic market, the price of gold futures at MCX gained 4.8% in January to settle at ₹41,052 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures too ruled firm and gained 0.6 % in January to end at ₹46,989 per kg. As anticipated, precious metals were confined within a range, trying to digest the spike witnessed in early January.

The short-term outlook for MCX gold and silver is positive. Gold futures price at MCX is on track to hit the target price of ₹41,600-41,800 per 10-gm that was mentioned last month. The positive outlook for MCX gold will be under threat if the price falls below the support zone at ₹38,900-39,200 per 10 gm.

Silver prices hit the target of ₹48,900-₹49,500 per kg mentioned last month. A breakout past ₹47,700 will confirm the positive outlook for MCX silver. The price could then head to ₹48,800-₹49,000 zone.

The positive outlook would be invalidated if the price closes below ₹44,800-₹45,100. A close below ₹44,800 would impart weakness and push MCX silver price to ₹42,500- ₹43,000 per kg. After several weeks of consolidation, precious metals have resumed their medium-term uptrend.

102,2020/02/09,"Centre to release another ₹35,000 crore compensation to States soon","The Centre will soon release another ₹35,000 crore to states to compensate for the revenue loss on account of GST rollout, an official said.

Under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) law, States are guaranteed compensation for revenue loss for 5 years if their revenue does not increase 14% on the base year of 2015-16.

There were no differences between the Centre and States with regard to compensation payment in 2017-18, 2018-19, and in the first four months of the current fiscal.

However, with revenue mop-up from compensation cess falling inadequate, the Centre held back fund transfer to states for revenue shortage beginning August.

Following this, States raised the issue with the Centre and in December 2019, ₹35,298 crore was released as compensation for August-September.

“We will soon transfer another ₹35,000 crore from the consolidated fund of India (CFI) to compensation cess fund in 2 instalments. The first tranche will be compensation for October-November,” an official told PTI.

The excess collection from compensation cess in 2017-18 and 2018-19 was deposited in the CFI earlier and this will now be transferred back to the compensation fund, the official added.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech said it is decided to transfer to the GST Compensation Fund balances in two instalments.

Under the GST structure, taxes are levied under 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% slabs. On top of the highest tax slab, a cess is levied on luxury, sin and demerit goods and the proceeds from the same is used to compensate states for any revenue loss.

The Centre has so far released about ₹2.11 lakh crore as GST compensation to states since the implementation of GST on July 1, 2017.

During July 2017-March 2018 ₹48,785 crore was released, while between April 2018-March 2019, ₹81,141 crore was paid to States. For April-May and June -July last year, ₹17,789 crore and ₹27,956 crore were released. Further, Rs 35,298 crore was paid to states as compensation for August-September 2019.

In an interview to PTI, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey had said revenues from GST will have to increase in order to resolve the issue of compensation payment to states.

“Revenue will have to increase and for that only we are looking at rate rationalisation, addressing issue of inverted duty structure and increasing compliance. This will ensure that requirement of compensation is less,” Mr. Pandey said.

He further said the government is looking at monthly average GST collection of over ₹1 lakh crore.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/quda3/article30695597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th31-Rajendran-Economy-and-nutrition,https://www.thehindu.com/business/centre-to-release-another-35000-crore-compensation-to-states-soon/article30775255.ece

GSTIN is a 15-digit PAN-based unique identification number allotted to every registered person under GST. While importers have to fill Bill of Entry with Customs department while importing goods, exporters have to file Shipping Bill.

“With effect from February 15, 2020, the declaration of GSTIN shall also be mandatory in import/export documents for the importers and exporters registered as GST taxpayers,” the circular said.

Data analytics by the revenue authorities have detected rampant tax evasion through black market and under-valuing of imports. It has come to light that although importers are paying GST, they are supplying the goods without bill.

Importers typically pay integrated goods and services tax or IGST on goods they bring into the country. This tax is supposed to be set-off against the actual GST paid by the final consumer, or claimed as refund.

While importers are paying IGST on imports but not claiming credit for the same. This essentially means that the supply of imported goods to domestic channels is being done without a bill.

A similar situation has been witnessed on cess charged on luxury and sin goods with companies paying it at the time of imports but not claiming credit or setting it off from final GST paid by consumers.

“Compulsory capturing of GSTIN by importers and exporters would give an adrenaline rush to the data analytics especially in relation to cross-border transactions. This will push the tax authorities to arrest the massive tax evasion practices on the borders in the form of under-valuation, clandestine removal and under re-reporting,” AMRG & Associates Partner Rajat Mohan said.

EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said the requirement to provide GSTIN in bill of entry/shipping bill will help plug GST revenue leakage and ensure that imports/export data is reconciled with GST data.

Further, exporters have also been asked to provide details of the state and district of origin of goods and details of preferential agreements under which goods are being exported in the shipping bill.

Mr. Jain said the data on district/state of origin of goods will help the Government take measures to facilitate and promote exports.

“The requirement to provide details of preferential agreements under which goods are exported will help the Government track the effectiveness these agreements,” Mr. Jain said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/965hb7/article30561223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUGST-1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/importers-exporters-to-mandatorily-declare-gstin-in-documents-from-feb-15/article30775151.ece
104,2020/02/09,"SEBI wants ‘difficult to recover’ tag for untraceable defaulters, cases facing parallel proceedings","Capital market regulator Sebi is planning to attach a ‘difficult to recover’ tag for individual defaulters who are found to be ‘untraceable’ as also for cases facing parallel proceedings by other agencies or in various courts and tribunals.

The proposal, likely to be discussed at Sebi’s board meeting next week, is aimed at better utilisation of resources towards cases with higher chances of recovery, a senior official said.

This separate ‘difficult to recover’ category is for cases where recovery of penalties and other dues from defaulters proves to be virtually impossible and the amount involved is not found to be worth an attempt beyond a point.

However, Sebi can initiate or continue its prosecution proceedings against the defaulters even after such a segregation and recovery procedure can be reopened in case there is any change in the prevailing parameters regarding the defaulter.

Modification to existing policy

The regulator is now considering a modification to its policy on ‘difficult to recover’ dues to include the criteria of ‘untraceable’ for individuals and ‘parallel proceeding barring recovery’, the official said.

In case of individuals, the existing policy provides for this classification for a person who has died leaving behind no assets and those who are alive but have no attachable assets or have become insolvent.

However, the income tax department rules for ‘difficult to recover’ cases has two more categories -- individuals who are untraceable and those who have left India.

The official said that Sebi did not include these categories earlier as it did not have enough data with respect to the cases involving untraceable individuals, while the final category became redundant after promulgation of the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act.

However, its analysis of pending recovery cases has now shown that many cases involving untraceable individual defaulters are fit for being declared ‘difficult to recover’

In case of companies, this classification applies to those having gone into liquidation or insolvency proceedings or are defunct, as also entities whose directors, promoters, partners or representatives have no attachable assets.

Regarding foreign companies, this category includes those having no presence, place of business, management, representative or attachable assets in India.

Recovery orders

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has got powers to recover money from various entities by way of passing orders for refund of money to investors, disgorgement of funds to be distributed to investors, and also collect fees and penalties levied by it.

Since getting the recovery powers in 2013, Sebi has initiated recovery proceedings against a large number of defaulters, but it has experienced difficulties during the execution of these proceedings in certain cases.

According to officials, difficulties mainly arise due to the defaulter being insolvent or financially unsound without having any attachable assets, or being a company whose assets or directors/ promoters are not traceable, as also individual defaulters being untraceable.

In some cases, the dues remain unrecovered even after executing all modes of recovery.

Earlier, Sebi norms did not provide for declaring any unrecovered dues as ‘difficult to recover’ and therefore all the proceedings used to remain in force along with other recoverable cases, thus hindering optimal utilisation of resources for cases with better chances of recovery, officials said.

In 2018, Sebi had formulated this policy, after taking cues from the procedure followed by the income tax department, following extensive consultations with the Finance Ministry, the Reserve Bank of India and the Corporate Affairs Ministry, but it has always been made clear that it should not be seen as “scaling down or writing off” of the dues.

Out of 2,500 recovery orders passed by Sebi so far, as many as 1,790 recovery certificates were pending (at end of November 2019).

Out of these, 136 were found fit to be declared ‘difficult to recover’, though not a single case has been put in that category as yet because the final verification of the steps are being carried out by newly appointed recovery officers prior to any such categorisation.

Out of the total 1,790 pending cases, the maximum number of 1,308 cases are pending at a stage after attachments of bank, demat and mutual fund accounts as the funds or securities available are not sufficient. Also, 301 of them are ‘defunct’ (17%) and 254 have been found to be ‘untraceable’ (14%).

Besides, the 136 cases that are fit to be treated as ‘difficult to recover’, as many as 97 are ‘untraceable’ for reasons including of failure to serve demand notice despite best efforts, non-availability of demat or bank account details, non-existence of right address and even PAN details being unavailable.

Besides, Sebi is also proposing a ‘difficult to recover’ tag for cases facing ‘parallel proceedings’ before various judicial and quasi-judicial fora such as National Company Law Tribunal, special courts, debt recovery tribunals, as also cases where stay on recovery has been granted by high courts or the supreme court, or where parallel attachment has been done by agencies like ED, Tax Department, EPFIO etc.

Out of the total 1,790 pending recovery cases, Sebi found that parallel proceedings were pending in 90 cases with some facing multiple litigations.

In cases where insolvency and bankruptcy proceedings have commenced, Sebi has no scope of recovery as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code prevails over the Sebi Act.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/tfhx22/article30653839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUSEBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sebi-wants-difficult-to-recover-tag-for-untraceable-defaulters-cases-facing-parallel-proceedings/article30775052.ece

“Whenever data from the 13,780 polling stations come in at night, each [data point] is added and then an exact number is given, which can be shared,” Deputy Election Commissioner Sandeep Saxena said. “Each piece of data and each voter has been accounted for. This takes time... There is no question of delay. It is a process. And when it is completed, it is shared.”

Mr. Singh informed that polling went on well past 6 p.m. at several booths in the city. Thereafter, EVMs were deposited in strong rooms and scrutiny of data began, starting 11 p.m. in some constituencies. “Our returning officers were busy through the night and then with scrutiny.... We have to appreciate that... we have to ensure accuracy. And I think it has been done in good time,” he said.

Mr. Singh also highlighted that the data for each constituency had already been shared with candidates through their polling agents as a consequence of which it “cannot be manipulated”.

The officials, however, could not reveal the number of votes cast after 6 p.m. or the number of booths at which polling went on after the deadline. They said data was being “culled out” and would be shared later.

The Chief Electoral Officer announced the figure at a press conference at 7 p.m.

The Chief Elector Officer said the total turnout took long to collect and calculate and hence took time to be shared.

“Absolutely shocking. What is EC doing? Why are they not releasing poll turnout figures, several hours after polling?” AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal said on Twitter commenting on the delay.

The last voting percentage given by the commission on Saturday night was 61.46%. The voting in the national capital to elect a new government ended on Saturday.

Hitting out at the Election Commission, deputy Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Manish Sisodia asked the poll panel if it was yet to receive the final voter turnout figure from the BJP office.

“BJP leaders are giving the voter turnout figures and on the other hand the Election Commission has not been able to give the final voting percentage 24 hours after polling got over,” Mr. Sisodia said in a tweet in Hindi.

“EC is saying they are compiling data. What’s going on? Are you waiting for the BJP office to give you the final figure?” Mr. Sisodia said.

Senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh, addressing the media in the afternoon, said the party feared a deep conspiracy. “Till now, whenever the elections have been held, the Election Commission used to declare the percentage of the voting almost immediately. It has been 24 hours since the voting of the Delhi Assembly completed, but the Election Commission is not ready to announce the voting percentage. This is pointing towards a deep conspiracy,” Mr. Singh said. The EC should explain the delay. “This is the first time in the history of 70 years, the Election Commission is not ready to announce the voting percentage,” alleged Mr. Singh.

“Any election, be it Lok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha, the EC used to announce the voting percentage on the same day. I remember that when the elections were held by the ballot papers, the Commission used to announce the voting percentage even at such times. But for the first time in the history of 70 years, such a strange thing happened,” Mr. Singh said.

Final polling figure of Lok Sabha elections is released on the same day, but in case of Delhi which has just 70 assembly constituencies, the poll panel is taking so much time to come out with the voter turnout percentage. It has been 24 hours but the poll panel is yet to release its official statement, Mr. Singh said, adding that the EC should should tell why there has been so much delay.

Exit polls for the Delhi assembly election on Saturday forecast a comfortable victory for the ruling AAP.

The Times Now-Ipsos exit polls predicted that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will retain his chair with the AAP winning 44 seats against 26 for the BJP.

The Republic-Jan ki Baat survey gave the AAP 48-61 seats and the BJP 9-21 seats.

The TV9 Bharatvarsh-Cicero predicted 54 seats for the AAP, 15 for the BJP and one for the Congress.

The AAP had scored an overwhelming victory in the 2015 polls, winning 67 seats and reducing the BJP to three. Congress had drawn a blank.

Polling passed off peacefully despite the run-up to the election witnessing several vitriolic campaign speeches and three incidents of firing at anti-CAA protest sites. Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur was barred from campaigning for three days for exhorting “traitors” to be shot.

As polling began on Saturday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal made a request to women voters to go out and vote. “Just as you shoulder the responsibility at home, likewise, the responsibility of the country and Delhi is on your shoulders. Also take the men in your family out to vote and discuss with them who is the right person to vote for,” he tweeted.

At the New Delhi constituency, President Ram Nath Kovind, Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were among those who voted. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra cast her vote along with her son Rehan, a first-time voter.

Protests continue

Voters in Shaheen Bagh, the epicentre of anti-CAA protests, turned up in large numbers to exercise their franchise. With Shaheen Bagh being used as a punching bag by the BJP during the bruising campaign, several voters present outside polling stations said that it was time for the Hindu-Muslim discourse to end.

In a bid to ensure that the Shaheen Bagh dharna continued, women protesters took turns to vote, with some arriving after spending the entire night at the protest site while others headed there soon after casting their vote. There was heavy presence of paramiltary forces in the Okhla constituency as Shaheen Bagh had been declared a “critical” area by the Chief Electoral Officer.

109,2020/02/09,Four-fold jump in Li-ion battery imports since 2016,"India has quadrupled its imports of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries and more than tripled its import bill on the product, vital for powering a range of devices from cellphones to electric vehicles, from 2016-2018, the Union Science Ministry said in the Lok Sabha last Friday.

Responding to a query, the Ministry said 175 million such batteries were imported in 2016, 313 million in 2017, 712 million in 2018 and 450 million from January 1, 2019, till November 30 of that year. The cost of these imports rose from $383 million (₹2,600 crore approx) in 2016 to $727.24 million (₹5,000 crore approx.) in 2017, $1254.94 million (₹8,700 crore) in 2018 and $929 million (₹6,500 crore) in 2019.

Indian manufacturers source Li-ion batteries from China, Japan and South Korea and the country among the largest importers in the world.

Limited numbers

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) manufactures such batteries but volumes are limited and they are restricted for use in space applications.

In June 2018, Central Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI) in Tamil Nadu’s Karaikudi, under the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) and RAASI Solar Power Pvt Ltd signed a Memorandum of Agreement for transfer of technology for India’s first lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery project.

To promote indigenous development of such batteries, the Union Cabinet in 2019 approved a programme, called a National Mission on Transformative Mobility and Battery Storage in the NITI Aayog to “drive clean, connected, shared, sustainable and holistic mobility initiatives.”

China dominates the Li-ion battery market. According to a report by BloombergNEF “... Around three-quarters of battery cell manufacturing capacity is in China, and Chinese companies have unparalleled control of required domestic and foreign battery raw materials and processing facilities.”

Electric vehicles are expected to account for a significant share in the growth of the Li-ion battery demand in India though reports say this is unlikely at least until 2025, because electric cars are still significantly costlier than their combustion-engine counterparts. The government has announced investments worth $1.4 billion to make India one of the largest manufacturing hubs for electric vehicles by 2040.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7pc988/article30776628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LITHIUM-ION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/four-fold-jump-in-li-ion-battery-imports-since-2016/article30776630.ece
110,2020/02/09,"Reservation in promotions | Congress, LJP disagree with Supreme Court’s order","The Congress on Sunday said it disagreed with the Supreme Court’s decision on the issue of reservation in appointments and promotions, and alleged that the rights of SC/ST communities are under threat during the BJP rule.

Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters here, Congress General Secretary Mukul Wasnik said the party will raise the issue inside and outside parliament. The Supreme Court held that States were not bound to provide reservation in appointments and there is no fundamental right to claim quota in promotions.

“In view of the law laid down by this court, there is no doubt that the State government is not bound to make reservations. There is no fundamental right which inheres in an individual to claim reservation in promotions,” a bench of justices L. Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta said.

The court said this while dealing with pleas regarding Uttarakhand government’s September 5, 2012, decision when the Congress was in power in the State, to fill up all posts in public services in the State without providing reservations to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. “We respectfully say that we do not agree with this decision...the rights of SC/STs are not secured under the BJP government,” Mr. Wasnik said.

“The Congress party believes that the appointment of SC/ST people to government posts should not be at the discretion of governments, but it is the fundamental right conferred by the Constitution,” he said. Echoing similar sentiments, Congress spokesperson Udit Raj, who was also present at the press conference, said the matter shows the contradiction between the BJP-led government at the Centre and in the State, as the Centre in a similar case had pushed for reservation in promotions. Taking on the saffron party, the Dalit leader said, “The BJP is basically against Dalits and reservation.”

‘Centre should pass order’

BJP ally Lok Janshakti Party also asked the Union government on Sunday to take immediate measures to ensure that the reservation benefits for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes besides the Backward Classes continue in the same manner as they have been for decades. LJP president Chirag Paswan tweeted to express his party’s disagreement with a Supreme Court decision that States are not bound to give quota to these communities in government jobs or promotion.

“The LJP does not agree with this decision of the Supreme Court...The party demands that the Union government take immediate measures to ensure that the reservation provision continues in jobs and promotion in the same they have been so far,” Mr. Paswan said.

LJP founder and Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan may raise the issue in a meeting with Scheduled Castes and Tribes MPs on Monday. “I have invited the SC/ST members of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha for a get together at my residence February 10,” he said.

113,2020/02/09,"Explained | What are E-visas, visas and visa-free travel?","India cancelled all valid e-visas after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China in recent weeks, prompting questions about the scheme which is viewed by many as a major facilitating move to help increase travel by foreigners to India. The e-visa system is an innovation introduced by the Narendra Modi government in 2014. The facility was expanded in 2017-2018.

Also read: Coronavirus | Foreigners who went to China after January 15 not allowed to enter India, says DGCA

The process has its roots in the 2010 Tourist Visa on Arrival (TVOA) scheme for Japan, Singapore, Finland, Luxembourg and New Zealand. This was also expanded later on. The change, however, came after the Modi government merged the TVOA with Electronic Travel Authorisation, thereby creating the e-visa. However, the e-visa has been in news often due to various political and non-political reasons.

1. What is the e-visa system and who all can get the visa?

India extends the facility of e-visa to the citizens of 165 countries around the world. The eligibility criteria for obtaining the e-visa require the applicant to have at least six-month passport validity at the time of applying. However, the facility is not available for the citizens of Pakistan and they are expected to apply for regular visas from the Indian High Commission in Islamabad. China is one of the countries which enjoys the facility as part of bilateral agreement to help promote people to people contact. Foreign nationals can avail of the e-visa for general recreational trip to India or to attend educational courses on music, dance, traditional medicine and yoga not exceeding six months. E-visas are, however, not valid for foreign diplomats which is dealt separately.

2. Is there any difference between e-visas and the regular visa?

The e-visa is a regular visa issued electronically. The e-visa is easy to control unlike the normal visa issued by the diplomatic missions of India. In some cases, a visa might require to be cancelled because of discrepancy in information or for some other controversial issue. The visitor would get to know of the cancellation in such cases only on reaching India or at the immigration counter in her country. An e-visa makes it easy to deal with such travellers avoiding unnecessary risk and office work, as the visa cancellation can be communicated online. During the ongoing coronavirus crisis in China, India cancelled e-visas that were previously issued to Chinese travellers thereby stopping the travellers from leaving Chinese immigration counter. However, in the past there were controversies over e-visas especially when issued to political dissidents like Dolkun Isa of China who received the e-visa yet found it cancelled at the end. The e-visa is also not meant for land crossings into India. For entering India, e-visas can be used in airports and seaports mentioned in the visa website of the Government of India. There are 28 airports in India that serve as entry points for the e-visa holding travellers. Five seaports, Mumbai, Kochi, Mormugao, Chennai and New Mangalore are the designated entry points for e-visa holders.

3. How can Indian nationals obtain visa-free facility abroad?

32 countries around the world grant visa-free entry to ordinary passport holders from India. These include several island nations from the Pacific Ocean region and the Caribbean region. The most liberal among these is Nepal that does not put any limit on the stay of Indians in the country. Maldives has waived visas for ordinary Indian travellers but has a limit of 90 days. The visa free facility is often in news because of reports of human trafficking from India that takes place through island nations located near the U.S. shores. Antigua and Barbados that grant visa-free facility for Indians grabbed headlines after diamond trader and fraudster Mehul Choksi escaped to the country. Antigua allows investors from India to travel visa free to its territory as attracting business persons and investors is part of the island’s policy. Island nations such as Dominican Republic have extended the visa-free facility to Indians for 90 days with the condition that it would be granted only to those with U.S./Shenzhen visa. Grenada and Haiti have waived visas for Indians. Kazakhstan uses this option to maximise air passenger flow to its national carrier and visa-free facility is granted for 72-hours transit for those travelling by Kazakhstan airlines. A key concern here remains how to ensure visa free facility for genuine Indian businessmen and tourists while keeping out illegal immigrants from India and as a result, countries that grant this facility to India often tweak the rules to suit their interest.

4. How many countries have bilateral agreement with India on visa free travel for diplomats and officials?

120,2020/02/09,IPS officer’s suspension kicks up row,"A day after the suspension of IPS officer A.B. Venkateswara Rao, a war of words ensued between the ruling YSR Congress Party and the Opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP). The late-night orders issued by the government generated lot of heat and dust with leaders of both parties turning to Twitter to trade allegations.

The State government’s Chief Adviser (Public Affairs) Sajjala Ramakrishna Reddy, in response to a tweet by TDP Vijayawada MP Kesineni Srinivas (Nani) said, “MP Kesineni has indirectly accepted the irregularities of ABV.”

Mr. Nani, posting a newspaper clipping carrying image and news of the suspension of the IPS officer, tweeted: “Wonder why you (CM) have suspended the person who played a key role in making you the Chief Minister, your YSR Congress Party win the elections and TDP lose, instead of felicitating him.”

Mr. Ramakrishna Reddy, in another tweet, levelled serious allegations against the police officer. “He ran a mafia. Used the equipment purchased to tap the phones of our leaders, including mine. Worked as a middleman in purchase of 23 MLAs. Tried to use the intelligence wing to defeat the YSRCP. Worked to suit the interests of CBN rather than the safety of people.”

TDP Polit Bureau member and MLC Yanamala Ramakrishnudu condemned the suspension done in the name of caste and party. Political motives should not be attributed to government employees. The vengeance of the government against the employees needs to be condemned. Administration has already gone haywire in the State. Duty was first for the employees irrespective of the government in office.

“For the first time, we are witnessing a ruler who is holding a grudge against people. What happened to the promise that you will discharge your duties without fear or favour, affection or ill-will?” he asked.

It’s not fair: CPI

TDP leader Varla Ramaiah tweeted that Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had thrown administration to the wind and resorting to vengeance against officials.

CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishna said it was not correct on the part of the government to suspend an IPS officer.

Seven lakh ration cards had so far been removed in the State, Mr. Lakshminarayana told the media here on Sunday.

The BJP leader was here to to gear up the party cadre for the ensuing local body elections.

The regional parties such as the TDP and the YSRCP would continue to do injustice to the people with their wrong policies, he said, and urged the people to choose the BJP, which, he claimed, had a clean track record.

He said that the “anti-people” policies of the State government would be highlighted during the local body elections.

Tie-up with JSP

“We have a political tie-up with the JSP. We will face the elections together. Allocation of seats is yet to be discussed,” he added.

Mr. Lakshminarayana urged the party workers to create awareness on the benefits of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) as they were aimed to preventing illegal entry of people into the country.

122,2020/02/09,"TDP creating confusion over KIA issue, says Gorantla Madhav","“The TDP has misled Parliament on the KIA Motors issue. Through its media, the party has created an unwarranted doubt over the company’s operations in Andhra Pradesh,” Hindupur MP Gorantla Madhav has alleged.

Coming down on TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu, the YSRCP MP accused him of getting a negative report written in a news agency against the KIA Motors. Mr. Madhav also lashed out at Mr. Naidu for frequently changing his stance on the Legislative Council issue.

Addressing the media here on Sunday, Mr. Madhav played a few video clippings to show how TDP MP K. Rammohan Naidu spoke in the Lok Sabha without properly reading the KIA Motors reaction put out by the news agency on February 5 that clearly stated that it was not moving out of A.P.

Without reading the report, the TDP tried to mislead the entire country. At a time when the TDP was supposed to protect the interests of the State, it was making baseless allegations, damaging the image of the State, Mr. Madhav alleged.

About his interaction with the KIA officials, which was being shown as though he had abused them, Mr. Madhav said he was only questioning them about jobs for locals, and added that he would continue to take up the cause of the local youth.

Responding to the criticism on his behaviour in the Lok Sabha, the MP said he had every right to stop anyone who tried to spread misinformation.

The JSP president was alleged to have said that the people of the district, particularly the students, had time to stage protests against him, but not for seeking justice to the victim.

“Mr. Pawan Kalyan has hurt our sentiments,” JAC convener B. Sriramulu said on Sunday, and added that the students did stage protests seeking justice to the girl immediately after the incident was reported in a private school in 2017, and were continuing to do so whenever required along with the victim’s parents.

The JAC members also met the police and asked them to withdraw the permission granted to the JSP president’s tour in the district.

Mr. Pawan Kalyan is scheduled to lead a protest rally demanding swift justice to a girl during his tour.

Mr. Sreeramulu said that the members of the JAC would not allow Mr. Pawan to tour unless he apologised to the people.

“If Mr. Pawan Kalyan is concerned about delivering justice to the girl, he should taken it up with the DGP. He never bothered to take up the cause during his meeting with several leaders in Delhi,” the JAC leader alleged.

124,2020/02/09,‘Film industry always stays apolitical’,"“The decision of the A.P. government to shift the capital out of Amaravati to Visakhapatnam is a political one, and the Telugu film industry has never taken part in any political decision,” senior producer, distributor and former president of the Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce Daggubati Suresh Babu has said.

“The industry always stays apolitical. The film industry people normally don’t speak collectively,” he reiterated, adding that there may be individual opinions. “We don’t have the wherewithal to come out with our views,” he told The Hindu.

People associated with the industry might react if there was something related to the industry, he said. Mr. Suresh Babu’s statement assumed significance in the wake of repeated requests of the farmers protesting in the Amaravati region to support their agitation.

‘Moral responsibility’

On Saturday, members of the student JAC of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi and farmers led bythe CPI leaders met representatives of the chamber in Hyderabad, including its secretary and producer Damodar Prasad, Prasanna Kumar and others, and requested them to extend their support to their agitation. They claimed that almost 65% of the cinema revenue was contributed by A.P., and so it was the moral responsibility of the actors to stand by the farmers.

Mr. Damodar Prasad assured them that he would hand it over to the persons concerned. He also made a point that people from the industry might respond individually and not collectively.

T.N. example

Outside the chamber, the student leaders and farmers held placards with photographs of top heroes, and raised slogans such as “Be real heroes, support Amaravati.” Citing the example of how the Tamil film fraternity had come out in support of Jallikattu, they said that Telugu actors should learn from them. Some of them said that if the need arose, they would not hesitate to enforce a ban on screening their films in Andhra Pradesh.

125,2020/02/09,‘Pressure from ruling party leaders stifling KIA Motors’,"Senior TDP leader Kalava Srinivasulu has alleged that the Ministers and MLAs of the YSRCP have been collectively stifling the KIA Motors with their “unrealistic demands for favours.”

A delegation of the TDP from Anantapur, headed by party district president B.K. Parthasarathi, tried address the media on Sunday right in front of the KIA Motors factory at Erramanchi by pitching a tent.

But the police removed the tent and made the TDP leaders leave the place stating that the KIA staff were not comfortable with such activities.

When Mr. Srinivasulu tried to persuade the police to allow them to address the media on a private land on the other side of NH 44, opposite the plant, the police did not budge.

The TDP, therefore, had to shift the venue of the media conference to a roadside restaurant nearby.

Later, the TDP leaders took a media team to Kodur village on the A.P.-Karnataka border to show the lands and buildings pertaining to the Lepakshi Knowledge Hub (LKH).

The TDP leaders demanded that a judicial probe be ordered into the scam involving LKH Special Economic Zone lands, as 8,844 acres was involved.

“If the government resumes the land, it can be given to genuine entrepreneurs to set up units,” they said.

While Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy could not keep his promise on LKH during his tenure as Chief Minister, N. Chandrababu Naidu was successful in bringing KIA Motors to the district, the TDP leaders said.

“If the government / SEZ developing agency is unable to set up any industrial unit, the land should be returned to the farmers of 22 villages who had parted with it for a price ranging between ₹50,000 and ₹1.75 lakh per acre,” said former government whip Palle Raghunatha Reddy.

A similar land scam in Obuladevaracheruvu mandal in the name of setting up a Science City had led to the suicide of many farmers, the TDP leaders alleged.

‘Questionable deal’

While the APIIC had taken land in March 2008 for setting up the LKH, it gave away lands to its head Shyam Prasad Reddy without any global competitive bidding during the Rajasekhara Reddy’s term on December 22, 2008.

The company was given a concession of ₹1 lakh per acre in the allotment price and 13% cut in service tax, former Hindupur MP Nimmala Krishtappa said.

The company promoter raised ₹690 crore from banks and used it for developing his own company, Indu Projects, he alleged.

Later, Indu Projects, in a quid pro quo, had invested ₹70 crore in Jagathi Publications, and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s role in it could not be ruled out, he said. “The Enforcement Directorate is looking into the issue by attaching the land,” he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/m4a32x/article30777675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10VJPG4-TDP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pressure-from-ruling-party-leaders-stifling-kia-motors/article30777676.ece

Speaking to the media here on Sunday, he said that on January 6 and 7, a number of tribal organisations from Agency areas had staged protest over their rights, but the government didn’t bother about their demands till now.

Land Transfer Regulation Act

Mr. Dora said that the JAC has been demanding proper implementation of Land Transfer Regulation Act 1 of 1970, popularly known as the 1/70 Act. He said that the Act checks the transfer of tribal land to non-tribal persons. He alleged that there had been a gross violation of the Act in regard to allotting mining leases in the scheduled areas to non-tribal persons and allowing non-tribal persons to own houses, lodges and hotels in various parts of Agency, especially where there is a huge tourist flow.

He also found fault with the ZPTC reservations list for local body elections alleging that none of the seats have been reserved for tribals.

Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney issued orders on Saturday suspending Mr. Rao, and directed him not to leave Vijayawada without obtaining permission from the government, during the suspension period.

Speaking to the media here on Saturday, MLA N. Ramanaidu said that he along with other members of the committee N. Chinarajappa, Nakka Anandababu and P. Anuradha visited different parts of the city to conduct an inquiry into alleged land scam.

He also added that the committee would also highlight the good work done by TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu for Visakhapatnam and north Andhra during his tenure and at the same time damage being done by the YSRCP to the region in the last eight months.

He said TDP was instrumental in setting up IIIT in Srikakulam and Bhavanapadu fishing harbour, millennium tower Adani data centre and Lulu convention centre.

He pointed out that the Sujala Sravanti project and Bhogapuram airport project were launched by Mr. Naidu.

According to him, it was Mr. Naidu who had rushed to the aid of people during Hudhud and Titli cyclones.

He questioned why Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy did not stop Adani and Lulu group, when they pulled out of the projects.

“If the projects were on, a number of youth from the region would have got employment,” he said.

“The millennium tower built by Mr. Naidu to promote IT in the State was now being transformed to Secretariat at the cost of IT growth,” he alleged.

139,2020/02/09,"Despite winning 25 seats, BJP is greedy and jealous: Shivakumar","The BJP, despite winning 25 seats in Karnataka in the Lok Sabha elections, is trying to “snatch” Bengaluru Rural Lok Sabha seat since they are greedy and jealous about the work being done there, the former Minister D.K. Shivakumar said on Sunday.

“BJP leaders are not happy despite victory in 25 constituencies. For no reason, they are attempting things in two seats — each won by the Congress [Bengaluru Rural] and the JD(S) (Secular) [Hassan]. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) is saying what the BJP cannot say publicly. They are projecting as if they are fighting on behalf of one caste and one religion,” he told reporters when his comments were sought on the RSS march in Ramanagaram.

“Let them come in whatever attire: be it shorts, pants or dhoti. We will not be bothered,” he said.

He alleged that the BJP was jealous about the work of his brother D.K. Suresh, who represents Bengaluru Rural in the Lok Sabha, and the love he had earned from people of the constituency.

He said both the Congress and the JD(S) miscalculated political moves during the Lok Sabha elections, and added that if he had played politics well, the BJP would not have won even 10 seats in the State. “We will rectify our mistakes. Party workers need not be anxious. We also know how to play our politics,” he added.

Referring to nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), he said the Congress was not behind those protests. “People are angry with the Centre’s attitude. After the Lok Sabha elections, the BJP has not got expected mandate from people be it in Maharashtra or Haryana.

Speaking to presspersons here on Sunday, Mr. Yediyurappa said that the State government was contemplating announcing a scheme to waive the interest amount on farm loans taken from the PLD and DCC banks and the cooperative societies.

He said that a larger number of farmers were caught in the debt trap as they were unable to pay interest on loans taken. Waving interest amount on their loans would give them some relief. This would cause a financial burden of ₹ 400 core on the Exchequer. This apart, the government was mulling over providing some concession to farmers who repaid loan amount before March 31, 2020. In all, the upcoming budget to be presented on March 5 would be farmer-friendly, he said.

To a query on Mahadayi issue, Mr. Yediyurappa said that the government was taking all steps to resolve the issue at the earliest and he had held discussions with the Advocate General regarding filing an appeal in the Supreme Court. This apart, money would be allocated for the Mahadayi project in the upcoming budget. He said that there was no proposal before the government to announce the formation of a new district.

141,2020/02/09,"FIR registration: police will be trained, says govt.","Police officers will soon be trained on the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Lalitha Kumari’s case on the manner of registration of FIR under Section 154 of the Cr. PC, the government has told the High Court of Karnataka.

Submissions in this regard were made before a Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar, during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by Bachpan Bachao Andolan, and a PIL plea initiated suo motu by the court for monitoring implementation of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.

The Bench, during earlier hearings, had criticised the action of the SPs of Kolar, Vijayapura, Ballari, Gadag, and Kalaburagi for reporting that no victim of child pornography were housed in the child-care centres in their districts without conducting proper investigation by registering FIRs as per the law laid down by the apex court on how the police must act in cases of cognisable offences.

A report of the Ministry of Woman and Child Development-2018 on the analysis of date of mapping and review exercise of child care institutions under the JJ Act, 2015, had stated that 113 victims of child pornography were kept in child care institutions, and the court had sought a report on the probe conducted in such instances. The FIRs were registered only after the court pulled up the SPs and the State police chief for not registering FIRs treating the Ministry’s report as basis, and the court had said that officers, including IPS officers, require training on the law.

143,2020/02/09,Breaking free from the shackles of bonded labour,"Papamma, 26, who works in baby corn fields with her husband at Harohalli taluk of Ramanagara district, savours her freedom. Her life today is a far cry from the one she led barely six years ago, when she worked 13 hours a day for a pittance and barely enough rest. Papamma was a bonded labourer forced to work at a brick kiln in Kanakapura for ₹72 day. “We were only allowed to leave the kiln on Wednesday afternoons for a few hours to buy provisions,” she recalled.

More than 40 years after the Bonded Labour System Abolition Act was passed on February 9, 1976, Karnataka is still grappling with the rampant but hidden problem. There are some former bonded labourers like Papamma who are slowly rebuilding their lives and helping others.

Papamma was resigned to ‘her fate’ until six years ago, when she, 11 adults and and three infants, were rescued by the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU), CID, the District Administration and local police assisted by International Justice Mission (IJM). Since their rescue in 2014, all 12 survivors and their families have been enjoying their freedom. Two of them have been elected as community leaders and assist other survivors in availing of government benefits and also ensuring their well-being.

Papamma’s case is a landmark of sorts as it is the first time an accused had been convicted for trafficking under Section 370 of the Indian Penal Code. “Life was very suffocating when we used to work at the brick kiln. Now, we can go out whenever we want and our children can go to school,” she said.

To ensure that more people like her are able to come out of the clutches of bonded labour and are rehabilitated successfully, a group of former bonded labourers have formed an association named Udayonmukha. Today, the association has 80 members, all of who used to be victims of human greed.

Another group member, Chandramma, was a bonded labourer in a sericulture factory in Sidlaghatta, Chickballapur district. The owners allegedly gave her an advance of ₹50,000 and confined her to the factory for six months. “My brother-in-law, my son and I were taken to the factory. My brother-in-law escaped after a week, but my son and I did not even see sunlight for several months. Our phones were snatched away and we had to wake up early in the morning and begin work that would go on till late at night,” she said. When she and her son tried to escape, the owners sent a few men to bring them back. “We were brutally beaten,” she said. Today, she works in a convention hall and does other daily wage jobs. As members of the association, she has been raising awareness on bonded labour and educating vulnerable members of society on labour laws.

As per data released by the Ministry of Labour and Employment in July 2018, Karnataka has rescued 66,281 bonded labourers, the highest in the country, since 1976. Prathima M., associate director, IJM, said this is an indication that the State government is proactive in addressing the crime. “Besides rescue and rehabilitation of bonded labourers, there is a need for the State government to initiate measures to deter these crimes,” she said. But for every Chandramma and Papamma, there are hundreds of men, women and even children trapped in bonded labour.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yj4q6n/article30773224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGBONDEDLABOURERSLEAVINGTHEBRICKKILN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/breaking-free-from-the-shackles-of-bonded-labour/article30773225.ece

Meanwhile his poem Ninna Dakhale Yavaga Needutti? (When will you submit your documents?) has gone viral on social media. It has already been translated into at least 13 languages including English, Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. “The poem has gone beyond the poet. People are translating it widely as they seem to think the poem voices their feelings too,” Mr. Bisaralli said.

A collection of poems with voices of criticism against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act titled after Mr. Bisaralli’s poem Ninna Dakhale Yavaga Needutti? has been published by Kriya Madhyama. It was released at the Kalaburagi Sahitya Sammelana.

One more collection on the theme is in the offing, being published by Ladayi Prakashana, Gadag.

‘Not a new phenomenon’

Yamuna Gaonkar, editor of the poetry collection Ninna Dakhale... told The Hindu that filing a case against a poet was not a new phenomenon.

“D.R. Bendre was arrested by the colonial British government for his poem Narabali. Now we have a government that is resorting to similar means. Poetry has taken to the streets in these dark times and it has become thea mode of protest,” she said.

The collection includes translations of poems and songs that have become anthems of protests across the country and in Karnataka too such as Hum Dekhenge by Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Hum Kagaz Nahi Dikhayenge by Varun Grover, apart from W.H. Auden’s poems on Nazi times.

The book also includes art work and posters inspired by the anti-CAA protests across the country.

Basu Sulibhavi, working on the other collection, said, “While it is a dark moment when the government is trying to push a divisive agenda, it is also when a large section of society has awakened. Like always, Kannada poetry has been engaging and responding to this moment, which we want to capture.”

Application for anticipatory bail

Booked for making ‘statements conducive to public mischief’ and ‘intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace’, Mr. Bisaralli has now applied for anticipatory bail in the Dharwad bench of High Court of Karnataka.

“I have been involved in several progressive movements in Koppal district, where I also run an online news portal and report for a news channel.

145,2020/02/09,Police who probed case booked by CBI,"In a twist to the controversial single digit lottery ticket scam that rocked the State, the CBI has filed a chargesheet against 10 police officers who probed to implicate senior IPS officer Alok Kumar in this case.

The CBI has also absolved prime accused Parirajan N. of all charges as the central agency concluded that the accused officials fabricated and planted evidence to indict him in the case.

Sanction sought

The CBI officials have now booked B.A. Padmanayan, retired IGP, besides B.M. Kanakalaxmi, G.T. Swamy, R. Ranganath, M.J. Lokesh, B.N. Sheekanta, Raviprakash, B.M. Tippeswamy, B.S. Venugopal and Ravi Kumar who were earlier working in Excise Enforcement and Lottery Prohibition Wing that probed the case. The CBI has asked the government for sanction of prosecution against many of the accused who are now serving in the department in and around the city. After reversing the course of investigation, the CBI is now probing the reason behind implicating senior police officers in the case.

Reacting to the CBI chargesheet, Additional Director General of Police (KSRP) Alok Kumar said that his name was dragged into the case unnecessarily.

The case was referred to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) that hinted that Parirajan was in touch with Alok Kumar, but could not substantiate the claim with the documentary evidence in its preliminary investigation report. However with these findings, the then DG-IGP Om Prakash recommended suspension Mr. Kumar within 42 hours.

“During my suspension I was not paid salary for several months and subjected to mental harassment and humiliation. However justice has prevailed at last,” Mr. Kumar said.

Fabricated elsewhere

The CBI investigations revealed that the then IGP Padmanayana, along with junior staff, had visited the homes of Parirajan, with the purpose of destroying the reputation of officers, and raided him at KGF in May 2015.

During the seizure, the now-accused officers had recovered cash, lottery tickets, result sheet and mobile phone. The CBI, however, recovered the seized items and sent them to the forensic laboratory where it was found that it was ‘fabricated elsewhere’ and was not in the hard disk of the CPU in Parirajan’s computer.

The CBI further said in the chargesheet that the ticket and result sheet was collected before searching Parirajan’s house.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-who-probed-case-booked-by-cbi/article30773096.ece

147,2020/02/09,Wipro earthian awards celebrate sustainability efforts of students,"Entries from 10 schools and eight colleges were selected for the annual Wipro earthian awards for 2019, which were presented on Saturday. This was the ninth edition of the event, organised by Wipro Ltd., which recognises excellence in sustainability within the education process in schools and colleges in the country.

Anurag Behar, chief sustainability officer, Wipro, said the programme brings together the themes of sustainability and education in meaningful ways. “The programme helps stimulate curiosity and interest in young minds in critical areas of sustainability. This edition involved an outreach to schools and colleges across 29 States and three Union Territories, including remote locations such as Ladakh, Sunderbans, Majuli island, Little Rann of Kutch, and the Nicobar Islands,” he said.

According to a release, the 2019 edition of ‘Wipro earthian’ received over 1,300 project entries. The winning entries were selected by an independent jury.

The teams selected from schools had to demonstrate their understanding of biodiversity, waste and water through a combination of activity-based learning programmes and essays. The college teams had to submit entries on the themes of water, waste and agriculture in the urban sustainability context.

Shreya Krishnan, a class 8 student of Kautilya Vidyalaya, Mysuru, was one of the winners of the theme of waste. “We worked with pourakarmikas in Mysuru and various agencies and NGOs working on waste management, and helped create awareness about segregation at source and the ban on using plastic.

148,2020/02/09,Karnataka Legislative Council: To be or not to be in existence,"Andhra Pradesh’s decision to do away with its Legislative Council has sparked off a debate on the need for an Upper House of the State legislature. In Karnataka, though there have been occasional debates on the Council sliding away from its mandate, abolishing it has never been seriously considered.

Karnataka has the oldest functioning Council in the country. The other States with an Upper House are Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Telangana. Karnataka is perhaps the only State that has increased its Council strength multiple times, to bring it to the present 75.

In 2015, JD(S) member from Turuvekere M.T. Krishnappa had tabled a private member’s Bill in the Assembly seeking abolition of the Council.

“The Council has become a rehabilitation centre for politicians who lose elections or are not electable. It has moved away from its purpose, and legally it is not mandatory,” he told The Hindu. The Bill did not gather any support. Earlier, though a few senior MLAs had expressed the same view, never had it taken any concrete form.

The Karnataka Legislative Council was started in 1907 as Praja Pratinidhi Sabhe in the princely state of Mysore, and it is highly regarded for its rich history and quality of interventions, said B.L. Shankar, former Council Chairman. Basavaraj Horatti, a seven-time Council member since 1980, said the House acts as a “forum of sane advice” and as a system of checks and balances against the excesses of the government. Political scientist Sandeep Shastri said that in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and several other States, Legislative Councils were abolished for political reasons — prominent among them being the Opposition having the majority in the House.

Many political observers and Council veterans, however, agree that the quality of the Council in the State has also been on a downward spiral and there is a need to make it more relevant. “The category of social work is being misused to nominate career politicians to the Upper House. The Council, which is supposed to be the House of elders and intellectuals, has today been reduced to accommodating politicians. It is filled with realtors and businessmen,” said a senior Council member who did not wish to be named.

Need for reconstitution

“The constituencies of teachers and graduates made sense during the colonial times when there was limited suffrage. They do not during times of universal adult franchise and when literacy rates are high. Those needs to be abolished,” said Dr. Shastri.

Mr. Shankar favoured retaining the teachers’ constituencies, but argued for adding representation for farmers and cooperative institutions.

Dr. Shastri said Legislative Councils need to be remodelled to represent the third tier of governance, like the Rajya Sabha that represents the States. “A majority of the members of the Council need to be elected from local bodies,” he said.

There has also been a trend of States wanting to reconstitute or constitute Councils. Two Bills to constitute Legislative Councils in Rajasthan and Odisha are pending in Parliament. In Tamil Nadu, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam has been consistently batting for the reconstitution of the Council abolished in 1986. Trinamool Congress has been favouring reconstituting the Council in West Bengal that was abolished in 1969.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/p5tjcs/article30772642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BGCOUNCIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/legislative-council-to-be-or-not-to-be-in-existence/article30772643.ece

150,2020/02/09,15th Finance Commission cuts Karnataka’s share in Central taxes,"Karnataka is all set to see a sharp reduction in its share of Central taxes in the 2020-21 financial year. The 15th Finance Commission, in its interim report for 2020-21, has reduced the State’s share of the divisible pool of Central taxes by more than one percentage point.

Based on the criteria and weights adopted by the 15th Finance Commission, Karnataka’s share in Central taxes has been fixed at 3.646% for 2020-21. This is 1.07 percentage points lower than the share of 4.713% that was applicable during the 14th Finance Commission’s award period of 2016-20. This is expected to cause a severe decline in the State’s share in Central Tax Devolution (CTD), according to Aditi Nayar, principal economist at credit rating agency ICRA Ltd.

Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, in its interim budget, the Centre had set aside about ₹39,000 crore in CTD for Karnataka. But in the Union Budget presented after the election, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman revised the estimate to ₹30,919 crore. This was lower than the ₹31,959 crore that the State received as CTD in 2018-19. In the budgetary estimate for 2020-21, the State’s share stands at ₹28,591 crore — a reduction of ₹3,368 crore from 2018-19.

Slowdown of the economy, below-target collection of GST, and reduction of corporate tax are the major reasons for the cut in allocation to the State.

The report, tabled in Parliament on February 1 by the Finance Minister, tweaked the criteria and weights under which funds are allocated to States, resulting in a sharp reduction in Karnataka’s share as the State was moving to the “upper middle income” category, sources in the government said. Citing a strong case for enhancing 1% of the divisible pool to meet the security and other special needs of the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, the share of various States in vertical devolution has been reduced from 42% to 41%.

Up and down

Consequent to the FFC’s recommendations, the tax share of southern States such as Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Karnataka has come down, while that of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra and Gujarat has gone up.

The criteria of distance of per capita income is used by the FFC as an equity criterion in the devolution formula. This provides higher devolution to States with lower per capita income (and lower own tax capacity). The FFC stated that poorer States with low per capita income also have higher expenditure and need to be provided help for comparable services. “Hence, the income distance criterion helps in providing for two-sided equalisation,” the FFC stated.

Moreover, the FFC took into consideration the population in Census 2011. The States with lower per capita income are the more populous ons and, hence, get more funds.

State to write to Finance Commission

Top State government officials have expressed concern over Karnataka’s declining share in Central tax devolution. They have decided to write to the Finance Commission and the Union Finance Ministry seeking a higher allocation. Karnataka hopes that the commission, which is expected to submit its final report in October, will take into account its grievances, sources said.

Special grant not given

The 15th Finance Commission had recommended a special grant of ₹5,495 crore to Karnataka for 2020-21, so that the absolute Finance Commission-driven transfers (devolution and revenue deficit grants) in the year remain similar to 2019-20. However, the Centre rejected the proposal.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/15th-finance-commission-cuts-karnatakas-share-in-central-taxes/article30772612.ece

152,2020/02/09,Stress on sustainable tourism in Kerala,"With the State set to be declared as the ‘World leader in Responsible Tourism (RT),’ the State RT Mission will further enhance sustainable tourism activities across the State.

The State government has already announced an ambitious target of achieving 25,000 new RT units and one-lakh job opportunities for local community members.

“Harold Goodwin, chair of International Centre for Responsible Tourism (ICRT) and World Travel Market (WTM) adviser, during his recent visit to the State stated that Kerala will be declared as the World Leader of Responsible Tourism in November 2022. Responsible Tourism seeks to minimise negative economic, environment and social impacts, while generating greater economic benefits to local people and enhancing the well-being of local communities. Considering this, the State Responsible Tourism Mission will initiate steps to expand community-level tourism activities along with facilitating tourism, trade and community-level linkages and encouraging adoption of Responsible Tourism principles and practices by stakeholders,” said K.

153,2020/02/09,RSS loses its early proponent in State,"Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue P. Parameswaran, who breathed his last at Ottappalam in Palakkad early on Sunday, had set in motion the ideology of integral humanism in the 50s when the intellectual and political space in the State was dominated by the Communist Party of India and the Congress.

The 93-year-old was widely influenced by the political philosophy propounded by Deendayal Upadhyaya of the Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS), the forerunner of the BJP.

Often referred to as ‘Parameswarji’, he was a non-conformist philosopher, possibly in his own right. He was a social activist, yet not a political celebrity in the broadest sense. He stayed away from electoral politics.

Parameswaran was honoured with Padma Vibhushan in 2018 and Padma Shri in 2004. He wrote with confidence and eagerness of a pundit taking on the likes of EMS Namboodiripad, M.N. Govindan Nair and N.E. Balaram.

Cultural nationalism

His ideas were solely based on cultural nationalism and spiritualism that knowingly or unknowingly touched the conservative psyche of Keralites even as his adversaries accused him of fostering the Hindutva element. But he rallied against them with his epigrammatic force of arguments.

Parameswaran was born to Parameswaran Ilayathu and Savithri Antharjanam at Thamarasseriyil Illam, Kayipuram, in Muhamma in Alappuzha in 1927. He graduated from University College, Thiruvananthapuram.

His contact with M.S. Golwalkar, the second Sarsanghchalak of the RSS, led to his becoming a pracharak. Later, he became the organising secretary of the BJS and later on the all-India secretary and vice-president. He was imprisoned during the Emergency in 1975-77.

In 1982, he returned to Kerala and gave shape to the Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram.

As an RSS pracharak, he remained a bachelor all his life.

CM condoles death

154,2020/02/09,State in the grip of a looming milk crisis,"Summer is still weeks away, yet a milk crisis is already looming over the State that has prompted the Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) to seek government intervention.

At present, the shortage is felt in Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam districts, forcing Milma’s Thiruvananthapuram Regional Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd. (TRCMPU) to cut down the production of toned milk (blue sachet) by 15%.

“Daily procurement under TRCMPU (covering Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta,and Alappuzha districts) that had stood at 3.68 lakh litres at this time last year has dipped to 3.2 lakh litres,” a senior official said. With the summer months constituting the annual lean period in milk procurement in the State, the current situation could worsen by March-April, affecting other districts as well, it is feared.

Abrupt reduction

Milma officials cited the abrupt reduction in supply from Karnataka and dip in production in the milk-surplus Malabar region as the immediate causes for the shortage. Milma procures around 12 lakh litres daily in the State. To fill the demand-supply gap, Milma purchases approximately 2.5 lakh litres of milk from the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF).

However, KMF cut down supply to one lakh litres from February 1 citing shortages in Karnataka. Milma’s efforts to procure consignments from Tamil Nadu have failed. With the scenario threatening to turn bleaker, Milma has requested the State government to take up the matter with the Tamil Nadu government.

“Our procurement is currently confined to milk cooperatives. Supply from Karnataka has come down. We are not getting milk from Tamil Nadu. We may have to explore other options,” Milma chairman P.A. Balan said. “We may even have to procure from private players after ensuring quality,” he said, warning that the milk situation could worsen by March-April.

Meanwhile, attempts to address the issue by purchasing milk powder is not proving financially viable for the federation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/73lyhn/article30777634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10tv-Milmacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-in-the-grip-of-a-looming-milk-crisis/article30777635.ece

156,2020/02/09,Sopanam singer alleges caste discrimination,"An alleged incident of caste discrimination against a Sopanam singer at Sree Karthyayani Bhagavathy Temple, Cheranalloor, is snowballing into a rift between the temple advisory committee and the Cochin Devaswom Board, which manages the temple.

Vinil Das, the singer, who belongs to a Scheduled Caste community, has complained of caste discrimination by a section of the members of the advisory committee. Mr. Das alleged that some members made casteist slurs at him and denied him rest room facilities. As the conflict intensified, a Devaswom official asked him to go on leave till the temple festival was over, said Mr. Das.

The singer had also moved the court besides filing police complaints. Mr. Das alleged that his predecessor had also faced similar discrimination and had sought a transfer to a temple near Thripunithura.

Reactions

However, O. Chandrasekharan, the former president of the advisory committee, denied any instance of caste discrimination against the singer. The youth joined the temple five months ago. Though the committee wrote to the board highlighting the issues, it didn’t act. The committee had asked board to move him out of the temple, as the issues affected the functioning of the temple, he said. Mr. Chandrasekharan said all the advisory committee members quit the post protesting against the attitude of the board.

Meanwhile, board president A.M. Mohanan conceded that there existed some conflicts between the artiste and the committee. Another singer was moved out of the temple following conflicts.

158,2020/02/09,State keen on launch of new-age courses,"The State will introduce inter-disciplinary courses in the higher education sector to enhance the skill sets of graduates. The budget has reaffirmed the government’s accent on introducing programmes in emerging areas of importance and efforts are under way to commence them at the earliest.

The Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) has constituted a panel, led by its vice chairman Rajan Gurukkal, to design such courses before recommending them for implementation by higher education institutions.

To fast-track the endeavour, the council’s governing body recently mooted a strategy to implement the new generation programmes even before the new posts are sanctioned by the government. Under the scheme, universities could be permitted to meet the expenses for salary for teachers from the fees collected from students.

Government funds

The additional expenditure necessary for running such programmes could be met by the government which will have to provide funds to universities in the form of matching grants. The council also proposed a formula of 75:25 as the ratio of funding shares that will have to be met by the government and the university respectively to implement the scheme.

Elaborating on the need to introduce such programmes, Kerala State Planning Board member B. Ekbal, who is also a member of the KSHEC governing body, pointed out that the State universities had largely confined themselves to traditional courses, despite the integration of various academic disciplines world over.

“The concept of basic science has gradually given way to the integration of physical science with biological science, social science with mathematics and so on. This is where we find the significance of courses such as bioinformatics, computational linguistics, and cognitive science. Barring a few universities that have introduced such programmes, we have not progressed much in the direction,” he said, adding that the curriculum must ideally nurture both skill and domain knowledge to enhance students’ employability.

Disconnect

He said there had been a disconnect between the higher education and the productive sectors in the State, leading to a stagnation of the latter.

The introduction of such courses would have a cascading impact on such avenues.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-keen-on-launch-of-new-age-courses/article30777604.ece

160,2020/02/09,GIS tagging for executing MGNREGS works,"Making local bodies more accountable for the implementation and review of works under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), the Department of Rural Development has decided to introduce Geographic Information System-based tagging of all properties to be covered under the scheme.

Only locations tagged under GIS will be selected for works next fiscal.

The local bodies will soon appoint special enumerators to survey public and private land or properties earlier proposed under the MGNREGS for implementing various development works.

Officials with the Rural Development Agency say the GIS tagging will help all monitoring teams to understand the geographical nature of an area and the details of resources required for its development.

The details of developed assets and their comparison with other executed works for proper decision making in the future will be possible through the new system.

Asset system

According to officials, the implementation of GIS for the MGNREGS will help authorities to evaluate the progress of the work through a single asset information system across the country.

Sharing of ego-spatial data for better planning of projects between various States too will be possible with the new move. Directions have been issued to all local bodies to implement projects under the MGNREGS in only GIS-tagged locations.

In the first phase, 100 grama panchayats will be covered under the survey and tagging process.

The list of selected grama panchayats under each blocks has been published for the information of local body representatives.

Mobile app

A special mobile application will be used for entering the data during the GIS tagging process. An interactive Web-based GIS management system will make it possible for the storage of collected information and make it available for planners for analysing the project development or asset management.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gis-tagging-for-executing-mgnregs-works/article30777600.ece

Employees of other public sector oil companies in the country will go on mass casual leave on April 20 in support of the BPCL employees. They will also join protest demonstrations on April 21. A joint convention of employees of the oil and petroleum companies would be held within March 2020 in centres like Mumbai, Kolkata, Guwahati, Kochi and other appropriate centres, the resolution from the convention said.

The employees have also decided to hold sensitisation and awareness campaigns against privatisation during the coming days as part of strengthening the protest action against the Union government move.

The strike and other protest action are being organised against the Union government decision to privatise the oil refining and marketing company.

Just the start

The convention said that BPCL was just the beginning of the privatisation process of the petroleum companies in the country. The Modi government budget for 2020-21 had “declared war of destruction” on the public sector. The government targetted raising ₹2.11 lakh crore from sale of stakes in PSUs.

General secretary of All India Petroleum Workers’ Federation I. M. Unyal, general secretary of National Federation of Petroleum Workers N. A. Khanvilkar and president of Petroleum and Gas Workers’ Federation of India Pradeep Mayekar are among the signatories to the resolution.

168,2020/02/09,Pinarayi Vijayan condoles death of RSS ideologue P. Parameswaran,"Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has condoled the death of RSS ideologue P. Parameswaran, 93. The right-wing Hindu theoretician died early on Sunday at a private Ayurveda Hospital in Palakkad.

Mr. Vijayan remembered Mr. Parameswaran as a theoretician who dedicated his entire life to further his political beliefs.

Writer and columnist

Mr. Parameswaran, who enjoyed a measure of success as a writer and columnist, was perceived more as an erudite Sangh Parivar moderate who could easily reach out to persons on the opposite side of the political spectrum.

He was born at Cherthala in Alappuzha district in 1927. He did his BA (honours) in history from University College, Thiruvananthapuram, and emerged a university topper, winning a gold medal in the process.

An institution builder, Parameswaran Ji nurtured eminent institutions such as the Bharatheeya Vichara Kendram, Vivekananda Kendra and others. I am fortunate to have interacted with him many times. He was a towering intellectual. Anguished by his demise. Om Shanti. pic.twitter.com/DMo2fBiL3r — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 9, 2020

A bachelor, Mr. Parameswaran was drawn to the RSS brand of Hindu nationalist politics from his student days. However, he shunned the cut and thrust of realpolitik and found his niche in writing, intellectual pursuits and informed debate.

Padmashree and Padma Vibushan

Mr. Parameswaran’s book on Sree Narayana Guru was critically well-received and tasted publishing success. The Vajpayee government honoured him with the Padmashree in 2004. The Modi government followed suit in 2018 by awarding him the Padma Vibushan.

Mr. Parameswaran had served as director of the Bharathiya Vichara Kendram, a Hindu nationalist think tank, since 1982. He had also presided over the Vivekananda Kendra in Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu.

Mr. Parameswaran also earned admirers for his austere and spiritual way of life.

169,2020/02/09,Mega Christian convention begins at Maramon today,"The sprawling sand bed of the Pampa river at Maramon near Kozhencherry, the traditional venue of the 125-year-old Christian convention, is all spruced up for the week-long annual event that begins on Sunday afternoon.

The Mar Thoma Evangelistic Association (MTEA), the missionary wing of the Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church of Malabar, that organises the event, and government agencies have made elaborate arrangements. A large thatched shed (‘pandal’) that can accommodate around one lakh people is ready.

MTEA general secretary Fr. George Abraham Kottanadu said various parishes of the Church in and around Kozhencherry and Maramon had supplied men and materials for constructing the ‘pandal’ and preparing the venue for the convention, which is essentially a spiritual retreat and a week of prayer and meditation.

173,2020/02/09,‘The Wild Wild West’ actor Robert Conrad dead at 84,"Veteran actor Robert Conrad, best known for playing Secret Service agent James West in 1960s’ CBS series “The Wild Wild West”, has died at the age of 84.

“He lived a wonderfully long life and while the family is saddened by his passing, he will live forever in their hearts,” family spokesman Jeff Ballard told People magazine.

Conrad died of heart failure in Malibu, California, a little less than a month before his 85th birthday, Ballard added.

Born in Chicago, Illinois on March 1, 1935, Conrad came to Los Angeles in 1958 and found instant success courtesy a recurring role on 1959 TV show “Hawaiian Eye”. His next show was “The Wild Wild West” (1965 - 1969) and Conrad’s performance as James West was well-received by the audience.

174,2020/02/09,‘Ayyappanum Koshiyum’ film review: Prithviraj and Biju Menon shine in this near-perfect entertainer,"A stray incident snowballing into a feud and nearly three hours of riveting reel time devoid of any customary gimmicks.

Sachy’s Ayyappanum Koshiyum is basically an extended ego match built on crude reality, yet very mainstream and compelling.

It is a dialogue-driven narrative, as much verbal as visual, but without over-punctuation or the burden of forced hilarity. The film also comes with a highly textured screenplay, creating an immaculate balance between lightness and intensity.

Ayyappanum Koshiyum Direction: Sachy

Cast: Biju Menon, Prithviraj, Gowri Nanda

Ayyappanum Koshiyum has Biju Menon and Prithviraj playing its sparring heroes, two flawed men who extract an instant nod of approval from the audience.

They meet on a forest road, one fighting tipsiness inside a car and the other on duty checking vehicles in Attappady, an alcohol-free zone. Koshy, a 38-year-old retired havildar, is taken into custody with his stock of alcohol. He brags about his ex-military status, challenges the policemen and runs amok till Ayyappan intervenes. He is slapped, dragged to the police station and unceremoniously dispatched to jail.

USP of the film

The day Koshy comes out of the prison the war is declared and he finds a formidable adversary in SI Ayyappan Nair, who has only a couple of years left for retirement. The USP of the film is the way Sachy builds an engaging and nearly perfect entertainer, right from the lightweight conflict in the beginning. It is not all about the nauseous flare-up of machismo as the script brings in awkward home truths and urgent arguments. Though both men come with shades of grey, the film also raises some pertinent questions about privilege and fairness.

Dialogues

It touches upon toxic sense of entitlement and modes of resilience, it talks about people who revolt when pushed back to their limits.

Though the dialogues mostly set the pace of the film, they are more or less organic and commonplace, not designer one-liners penned for a special purpose.

Biju Menon brings in a kind of freshness to the ‘audacious underdog’ and ‘beast-unleashed’ themes while Prithviraj is equally impressive as the boozing, carefree brat.

Neat performance

Ranjith plays his father Kurian, a man who exudes arrogance from every cell of his body, an epitome of disgusting patriarchal pride, something he always celebrated in his movies as a director and scenarist.

Gowri Nanda gives a neat performance as the Adivasi wife and all the supporting cast leave an impression.

The music is another vital aspect, which adds to the tempo of the film and cinematography by Sudeep Elamon maintains the mood without any disconcerting fluctuations.

And together they make Ayyappanum Koshiyum a gripping affair, rugged and confident.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3jck5u/article30773061.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09tv-ayyappanum-Koshiyum-still,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ayyappanum-koshiyum-film-review-prithviraj-and-biju-menon-shine-in-this-near-perfect-entertainer/article30773062.ece
175,2020/02/09,Schools asked to create vegetable gardens for nutritious meal centres,"To help set up vegetable gardens in 10,024 nutritious meal centres across Tamil Nadu, the Department of Elementary Education has called upon students, school management committees and parents, who are farmers, to work with officials from the Department of Agriculture and Horticulture to implement the initiative under the Puratchi Thalaivar MGR Nutritious Meal Programme.

Following an announcement in 2019 by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the Assembly that vegetable gardens would be set up to aid nutritious meal centres across the State, the Department of Social Welfare and Nutritious Meal Programme released a government order detailing the initiative.

Each centre providing children with noon meals will be given ₹5,000 to help start the vegetable gardens and the produce will be used in the preparation of meals. The objective is to ensure students have nutritionally rich food.

“We have now asked district-level education officials to ensure that schools are aware of the initiative and told them to start setting up these kitchen gardens. By involving children, this will give them hands-on experience on how to grow vegetables and will teach them the importance of farming and organic produce,” an official from the Department of Elementary Education said. A circular to this effect was sent on February 5 to all districts.

While schools that have space on campus can allocate a small plot for the vegetable garden, those with space constraints have been asked to set up roof-top gardens.

“Students can be divided into groups of 8 or 12 and each group can be allocated a small section of the garden to be in-charge of. While officials from the Horticulture and Agriculture department will help set up the gardens, students can be taught how to take care of it,” the instructions issued for the initiative said.

Teachers and school management committees have been asked to help out the students if needed and schools have been asked to speak to the children about the vegetables harvested from the garden during the morning assembly before they are handed over to nutritious meal centres.

Several government and government-aided schools across districts have independently started small vegetable gardens on their campuses over the last few years. Many teachers feel the initiative will encourage students to spend time outdoors as well as sensitise them to organic produce and make them environmentally conscious.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/umzz3t/article30775471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CAUVERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/schools-asked-to-start-vegetable-gardens-for-nutritious-meal-centres-across-tn/article30775472.ece

Speaking at a well attended meeting organised against the CAA, Opposition leaders, including Indian Union Muslim League, DMK and allies said that the Act had paralysed normal life in many regions. People, especially, those belonging to minority communities, were apprehensive. The BJP, by passing the Bill, had only exposed its true colours.

“The BJP came to power by giving false promise and claiming to work for the nation’s development. Nothing has been done. There is no sign of any development. On the contrary, the noise from those without jobs is becoming louder”, she said.

Taking a dig at the AIADMK, the DMK MP said that it had lost its sheen with its anti-people measures. Hence, both the BJP at the Centre and the AIADMK in TN should be chased away from the State.

180,2020/02/09,Tamil Nadu CM Palaniswami defends Ministers mired in controversies,"Chief Minister Edappadi K.

Rajenthra Bhalaji, whom Opposition parties have accused of making pro-Hindutva statements.

Addressing the media at Coimbatore airport, he defended Mr. Sreenivasan’s actions, saying the Minister was “an aged person”. “He is about 70 years of age. As there was a stick between his feet and his slippers, he had asked the boy standing nearby to remove it. He has explained it and has also expressed regret, that too publicly through the media. He has clarified that the boy is like his grandson. It is painful to see the media blowing the issue out of proportion,” he said.

On the CPI(M) accusing Mr. Bhalaji of functioning like a Hindutva propagandist, the Chief Minister said, “I know very well that he is highly pious. He may have expressed his personal opinion. The Fisheries Minister has already clarified that it (what Mr. Bhalaji had said) is not the AIADMK’s view.”

On the demand for a CBI probe into the scams involving the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC), he maintained that the TNPSC was an independent and autonomous body, adding that an inquiry was on. “The TNPSC has initiated steps to bring the culprits to book,” he said. “The government wants a fair probe and hence has not interfered [in the investigation]. The police are arresting the wrongdoers,” he added.

To a query on cancelling public exams for Classes IX and XI, the CM said that in the absence of an examination, it would be difficult to assess the standards and quality of the students. “Exams help parents and teachers assess the capabilities of students.

181,2020/02/09,"The Big Picture: The Tamil vs Sanskrit debate turns spotlight on the Thanjavur Big Temple, yet again","Thanjavur’s Brihadeeswara temple, an outstanding symbol of the greatness of ancient Tamil civilisation, is no stranger to controversy.

Whether it is the ‘jinx’ attached to the temple or the Centre’s opposition to the transfer of the management to the State government in the 60s and 70s or the installation of Rajaraja Chola I’s statue within the temple premises or the fire and the consequent stampede in June 1997, the temple has been in the limelight all through.

This time, the kumbabishekam (consecration), held after 23 years, on February 5, provided yet another opportunity for historians, scholars and political activists of different camps to engage themselves in an intense argument over the binary — Tamil versus Sanskrit.

“I do not remember having come across any such debate when the previous kumbabishekam was held in June 1997,” recollects T.N. Ramanathan, who was the then District Collector of Thanjavur. “The latest controversy sounds new to me,” he adds.

R. Nagaswamy, a veteran archaeologist who has been studying the temple for decades, emphasises that when paal abishekam (pouring of milk) was done on the lingam in 1997, a verse of Thirugnanasambandar [in Tamil] was recited. “It is there in a video cassette being sold at the temple,” he points out.

In tune with the State’s popular political narrative, the language row is viewed as one more dimension of the larger debate — Aryan versus Dravidian. This was despite Rajaraja Chola I himself being a promoter of both Tamil and Sanskrit, which could be attested to by inscriptions available on the temple premises.

But, P. Maniyarasan, an advocate of the concept of Tamil nationalism, argues that just as English is dominating every field of public activity in contemporary times, Sanskrit played a similar role, even from the period of Pallavas who predated the Cholas. “We see it as a sign of imposition by external forces,” he says.

The essence of the controversy was whether the consecration should take place in Tamil or in Sanskrit. Or, in other words, it should adhere to Agama principles or the Tirumurai, a 12-volume compendium of Tamil hymns in praise of Lord Shiva. While Tamil proponents contend that the Tamil works are superior to what has been written in Sanskrit, archaeologists such as Dr. Nagaswamy and T. Sathyamurthy, former Superintending Archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), say the issue is not quite about what is superior.

The greatness of the Tamil work was never in question. But, as far as temples in Tamil Nadu are concerned, they follow the Agama principles, which are nothing but a set of regulations about all aspects of temples — from design to construction to sculpture to rituals. And, they are in Sanskrit.

“The Agamas say that any ritual in a temple is not complete without the rendering of Tamil hymns. To render Thevaram, Rajaraja had appointed 50 persons, known as Oduvar,” says Dr. Nagaswamy. Developed around 5th century CE, the Agamas marked an improvement over earlier and heretic systems known as Pasupatha and Kalamukha.They were written in Sanskrit, explains Dr. Satyamurthy.

At court’s door

Not surprisingly, the language issue reached the doorsteps of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court. An apprehension was expressed that the event would be held, completely ignoring Tamil. The court termed as ""baseless"" allegations of the petitioners that the Tamil language was being excluded. The Agama principles include the recitation of Tirumurai by Oduvars, as done earlier, and the Tamil language had been given due prominence in the rituals, the court observed.

Also, the court said the claim of the petitioners that the consecration ceremony and other allied functions of the Big Temple were performed ‘hitherto exclusively’ in Tamil was ‘without any proof or foundation worth acceptance’.

A senior official of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department says that not just at yagasala and mahabhishekam at various shrines, Tamil verses were rendered, for the first time, even at the time of kalasa abhishekam (pouring of holy water on the apex structure of the temple’s tower).

Lessons learnt

For all the hue and cry generated in the run-up to the consecration, on D-Day (February 5), the event went off smoothly without much acrimony, thanks to a combination of factors including efforts made by the State administration.

“Super. Fantastic.” This was how L. Ganesan, senior leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a son of the soil, responded to a query on the quality and level of preparations. “The authorities had apparently gone into each and every detail concerning those who came for the festival. For example, the arrangement for car parking was novel. As soon as my vehicle was parked at a given slot, a sticker, mentioning my car number, was stuck on the car windshield. The sticker had a mark, in an inconspicuous way, that the car belonged to a VVIP,” says Mr. Ganesan.

Apparently, the State administration was guided by lessons that it learnt from two events — the 1997 consecration and the 2019 Athi Varadar festival in Kancheepuram. Twenty-three years ago, on the eve of the originally scheduled date of kumbabhishekam, a fire at the yagasala and the consequent stampede led to the death of 46 persons. The injured numbered 107. The bursting of firecrackers, which was the cause for the fire, was banned this time. Besides, unlike in the previous event when a low-profile committee was formed, a high-level team of officers, led by Chief Secretary [K. Shanmugam], was set up.

The Athi Varadar festival, which had attracted over one crore people in 45 days, had provided lessons to the administration on crowd management. Just as Mr. Shamugam made an inspection of the arrangements on Saturday last, Director General of Police J.K. Tripathy, who had overseen the arrangements both for the 2016 Mahamaham [Tamil Nadu’s equivalent to the Kumbh Mela in northern parts of the country] in Kumbakonam and the Athi Varadar festival, went there a day later. Also, the present District Collector, M. Govinda Rao, had experience with regard to religious events as he was Sub-Collector of Kumbakonam during the Mahamaham,

There were complaints that the administration took care of only VIP and VVIP devotees, “leaving in the lurch the common devotees”. But, Mr. Rao denies the charge and says that “proper zonation” was done to ensure “smooth passage” to different categories of people. The public had entry and exit points separate from those of the VIPs and VVIPs, who numbered 7,000. Options were given to the people of watching the consecration or havingdarshan of the presiding deity at the central shrine or both.

In the spotlight

The controversy over the consecration had its positive side too.

It only facilitated greater visibility to the event through the media, as otherwise this would go off like yet any other event, says P. Kangeyan, a doctor based in San Jose, California, who took time off to visit Thanjavur.

The turnout itself appears to be overwhelming, if one goes by the claim of the Collector. An estimated 6.5 lakh persons viewed the event. The Collector’s estimate has been arrived at based on the number of people who congregated at 30 view points in the temple town, apart from those who were inside the temple premises. “It is our calculation that around 10.5 lakh persons visited the temple in the five days, starting from February 1,” Mr. Rao says.

What is more interesting than the arrangements is the discussion on the number of times the temple had kumbabishekam.

Officially and even as per a group of scholars, the latest was the sixth, the previous instances being 1010, 1729, 1843, 1980 and 1997. But, disagreeing with this view, Dr Nagaswamy, relying on inscriptions on the temple, stresses that even during 17th century CE-19th century CE, there were four such events.

The focus on the Big Temple should not end with the consecration as the monument requires to be studied from different angles. Dr. Sathyamurthy, who has studied, in his own way, the structural stability of the temple, says the meteorological department and Geological Survey of India recorded, in the last 200-odd years, at least 10 earthquakes, having the magnitude of 5 and more on the Richter scale and with the southern peninsula being the epicenter.

Several Chola monuments, including the Brihadeeswara temple, had withstood them.

Pointing out how engineering features had protected the temple from external gravitational forces for over 1,000 years, he asserts that several precautions, adopted by modern architects and experts in the field of seismology for the protection of the roof and supporting structure, had been followed in respect of the superstructure of the temple too. “It is for modern architects to study the temple more deeply and learn various scientific formulae that had been employed,” the veteran archaeologist feels. Such research would be more meaningful to society than any public discourse being guided on predictable lines.

And, that would lend further fame to the Chola monument, which is, in the words of historian K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, “a masterpiece constituting the high-water mark of south Indian architecture”.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5x7cz8/article30773366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/T5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/the-big-picture-the-tamil-vs-sanskrit-debate-turns-spotlight-on-the-thanjavur-big-temple-yet-again/article30773367.ece
182,2020/02/09,Rajaraja Chola’s statue stays outside the Big Temple he built,"Fifty years ago, the State witnessed a controversy over the installation of the statue of Rajaraja Chola I, who built the Brihadeeswara temple.

The then DMK government and a committee, headed by Kundrakudi Adigal, wanted the statue to be kept within the premises of the temple, which became a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India in the late 1940s. But, the Central government was firm that nothing should be done to disturb the original character of the temple.

In January 1970, the Archaeological Survey of India sent a communication to the Palace Devasthanam, intimating the refusal of the permission [Even now, the temple is managed by the Palace Devasthanam, under the supervision of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department].

In April 1970, the then Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi unveiled the statue, which is now kept in a park close to the Maratha gateway.

Fourteen years later, in September 1984, in connection with the 1000th anniversary celebration of Rajaraja’s accession to the throne, the AIADMK Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran revived the demand by appealing to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to grant permission to the State government for the installation of a statue of Rajaraja Chola inside the temple.

Even though The Hindu, in its edition on September 15, 1984, carried a report from New Delhi about the Prime Minister’s approval, nothing on the matter was heard later.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xz27rr/article30773337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08TH-PONDY-RAJARAJACHOLANSTATUE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajaraja-cholas-statue-stays-outside-the-big-temple-he-built/article30773339.ece
183,2020/02/09,Tamil Nadu police recruitment hit by certificate scam; 1000 candidates involved,"Close on the heels of the recruitment-for-money scam in the TNPSC, a major fraud in the recruitment of police constables, prison warders and firemen by the Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board has surfaced with at least 1,000 candidates, who had cleared the written examination/physical efficiency test and qualified for appointment under the Sports Quota, found to have submitted “ineligible” certificates.

The TNUSRB had notified the recruitment of 8,888 Grade-II Police Constables, Grade-II Jail Warders and Firemen late last year.

About 3.25 lakh candidates appeared for the written exam in 32 districts. The physical efficiency test was then held in 15 centres for 47,000 candidates who passed the examination.

Nearly 8,800 candidates who qualified for appointment were called for certificate verification. However, during this process it was found that at least 1,000 candidates, claiming appointment under the 10% sports quota, had submitted “ineligible” certificates.

The associations that issued the sports certificates were not recognised by the Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) and hence not competent to issue such certificates.

“We sent out emails to all the 1,000 candidates saying that their certificates were ineligible/ not recognised by the SDAT and hence they were not entitled to be considered for recruitment under the sports quota,” a senior police official told The Hindu on Saturday.

“Their candidature was brought under the General or Reserved Category as applicable. Of the 1,000, about 200 candidates, whose cut-off marks fell within the range set for reserved categories, became eligible for appointment. As many as 800 others became ineligible, ” he added.

Parrying questions on whether one sports association or centre had issued the certificates, a senior police official in the Police Headquarters said a special team was analysing the veracity of the certificates and the antecedents of the issuing associations.

“It was like some unknown sports association certifying that the candidate played a match in a neighbouring State and hence represented Tamil Nadu in an inter-State tournament. Appropriate legal action — both against the associations and candidates — will be taken if it is found that the certificates were issued on payment of money with an intention to commit fraud,” the official said adding that no decision had been taken yet on referring the matter for criminal investigation.

However, a allegation that many candidates who were coached in a particular centre in Vellore had the TNUSRB examination was verified and found to be baseless.

Tamil Nadu Uniformed Service Recruitment Board exam under way at a centre in Madurai on August 25, 2019.

“A detailed analysis of the OMR conning sheet and answer scripts was done to check any suspicious pattern. The allegation was not true. We verified and found that the Centre is giving free coaching and physical training to underprivileged candidates and collects a nominal fee only of they get appointment,” the official said

After the process of screening was completed, a total of 8,773 candidates, including 2,432 women and transgender persons, were provisionally selected in the common recruitment. Training for these selected candidates would commence soon. In order to ensure transparency, the TNUSRB published the list of candidates, their enrolment numbers roster wise selection and marks scored on its official website.

The unearthing of the scam in police recruitment comes close on the heels of the sensational fraud in the examinations conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission which rocked the State.

185,2020/02/09,"Don’t interfere with transfer of doctors, govt. urges High Court","The State government has urged the Madras High Court not to interfere with the inter-district transfer of government doctors who took part in the strike between October 25 and November 1 last year in support of their various demands, including pay hike.

In a counter affidavit filed before Justice N. Anand Venkatesh, Director of Medical and Rural Health Services (DMS) T.S. Swathi Rethnavathi said: “Strike affects society. In case of strike by doctors, innocent patients suffer. Doctors’ strike cannot be justified on any equitable ground.”

The counter was filed in response to a batch of writ petitions filed by the doctors concerned, through their counsel C. Kanagaraj, challenging their transfer.

Advocate-General Vijay Narayan pressed for dismissal of all writ petitions. Mr. Narayan argued that the Supreme Court, in Rajendra Singh’s case (2009), had stated that courts should not interfere with transfer orders passed in public interest and for administrative reasons if there was no mala fide intention.

However, when the petitioner’s counsel claimed that those working under the Director of Medical Education (DME) could not be transferred by the DMS and vice-versa, the judge asked the A-G to get it clarified by Tuesday.

In her counter, Ms. Rethnavathi said the government health facilities in the State cater to over five lakh outpatients and 60,000 inpatients every day and 68% of child births in the State were handled by government healthcare institutions.

While taluk and district headquarters hospitals, categorised as secondary care institutions, fall under the administrative control of DMS, the tertiary care institutions such as medical colleges attached to government hospitals were under the control of DME.

There were more than 16,000 medical officers in Tamil Nadu Medical Service before 2009 and they did not have sufficient promotional opportunities.

Hence, at the request of Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association (TNGDA), the government introduced time-bound career progression.

Fresh demands

Although the government doctors were now paid as per the recommendations of the Seventh Pay Commission, the DMS said, new demands were raised last year by a federation of a few “unrecognised” doctors’ associations.

Even as their demands were being considered, members of the Federation of Government Doctors’ Association (FOGDA) began an indefinite strike when there was a dengue outbreak across the State.

The strike commenced despite a warning issued by the government on October 18.

The doctors observed hunger strike inside the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai and caused inconvenience to patients and other doctors who were not part of the protest. Further, the participants instigated other doctors too, Ms. Rethnavathi said.

“As per medical ethics, doctors should be selfless healers who are not really in it for money but care for the sick… Doctors are supposed to adhere to a professional code of conduct that prohibits them from participating in strikes,” she added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ehky87/article30773011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHENNAI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dont-interfere-with-transfer-of-doctors-govt-urges-high-court/article30773012.ece

187,2020/02/09,‘Anti-CAA campaign has received 2 crore signatures’,"The Opposition-led campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act has received over two crore signatures, exceeding the original target of one crore, DMK president M.K. Stalin said on Saturday.

The signatures will be submitted to President Ram Nath Kovind in the coming days, he added.

“People have understood the consequences of CAA and have participated in the campaign of their own accord. Some people have ridiculed the campaign and demanded that it be banned. But it is a democratic movement,” he said while participating in the campaign in Tiruvallur.

Calling upon the Centre to repeal CAA and not to proceed with the National Population Register (NPR), Mr. Stalin said the campaign will continue till the Central government concedes to the demands of the DMK and its alliance partners.

Mr. Stalin said CAA was actually a ploy to divert the people’s attention from the government’s failure in tackling various issues, including the economic slowdown, farmer suicides and unemployment. “We consider all Indians to be equal. But the government led by Prime Minister Modi is against the idea. Today, the situation has come to such a pass that even the European Union has criticized CAA,” he said.

He alleged that CAA sought to divide people and targeted Muslims and Sri Lankan Tamils, who remained refugees in Tamil Nadu. “People from Kashmir to Kanniyakumari have been subjected to untold suffering because of the Act,” he claimed.

Demanding the release of Jammu & Kashmir’s former Chief Ministers, who are under detention, Mr. Stalin said the BJP should not consider itself the sole proprietor of patriotism and portray others as enemies of the State.

188,2020/02/09,T.N. not the only State facing GST arrears issue: Sitharaman,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said the issue of GST arrears was not restricted to Tamil Nadu alone, and was being faced by all States. The Central government was working towards settling the dues, she added.

The Tamil Nadu government has consistently raised the issue. During a pre-Budget meeting, the State’s Deputy Chief Minister and Finance Minister O. Panneerselvam had pointed out that the Centre was yet to disburse the Integrated Goods & Services Tax (IGST) arrears to T.N. for 2017-18, amounting to ₹4,073 crore.

Responding to a query on the GST arrears to Tamil Nadu, Ms. Sitharaman said no State was being sidelined, and the arrears will be paid in two instalments, as announced in the Budget. The government was taking various steps to plug loopholes in GST collections, with a particular focus on preventing people from misusing or gaming the system. On the issue of bringing petrol and diesel under the ambit of GST, Ms. Sitharaman said the States should first arrive at a consensus on the matter. Once that is achieved, an amendment will be introduced to the GST law, she said.

On the announcement made in the Budget that Adichanallur will be developed as an iconic archaeological site, and why no mention was made about Keezhadi, she said, “We have not announced the [development of] Adichanallur site on our own. We have had consultations with State governments before making the announcement. The State government is already working on developing the Keezhadi site.”

Goal of 8% growth

Earlier, during an interaction with economists, industry leaders and representatives of various trade bodies, she said the government was working towards the goal of 8% growth, and the various announcements made in the Budget and the initiatives implemented by the Centre will help achieve the goal.

If the banks were denying loans without reason to MSMEs, the affected firms could send their complaints by mail to a special centre, which will be announced soon, she said.

190,2020/02/09,Our commitment to rule of law in question: Sanjay Baru,"The world’s view of India as a rising power was being challenged today and India’s claim to its commitment to constitutional values and the rule of law was being questioned, which was hurting both citizens and corporates, said Sanjaya Baru, media adviser to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

Delivering a talk on ‘The Rule of Law, the Economy and Ease of Business in India’ as part of 14th ML Ramakrishna Rao Memorial Oration in Law, and 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, organised by Vidhi Manch (Law Forum) in Hyderabad on Sunday, Mr. Baru spoke about funds allocated to the judiciary, challenges to the Rule of Law in India, slowdown of the Indian economy, and other aspects.

Slowdown

He said that growing at an unprecedented rate of over 8% per annum between 2003 and 2012, the economy has slowed down to an average rate of growth between 5% and 7%, depending on which numbers one took seriously. Whatever be the accuracy of the data, the fact was that Indian economy had slowed down, he said.

“There has been much discussion among economists on whether the ongoing slowdown was merely cyclical, and so amenable to fiscal and monetary policy intervention, or whether it was structural, so requiring policy change of a more fundamental kind. To make matters worse, there is increased political uncertainty and chaos caused by recent political intervention, including the heightened communal rhetoric by those in responsible positions of power,” he said.

Allocation to judiciary

Mr. Baru said that to expect the judiciary alone to become less of a hurdle to economic growth and to improving the investment climate would be unfair.

He said economists had, for some time now, complained that India had spent less than 1 % of its national income on the judiciary, far less than most democracies.

“It is disconcerting to see that the Union Budget for 2020-21 has in fact reduced the funds available for judicial and legal infrastructure, for justice delivery and legal reforms,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/j8sbx/article30777689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10SANJAYBARU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/our-commitment-to-rule-of-law-in-question-sanjay-baru/article30777571.ece

“Half of Bangladesh will be empty (vacant) if India offers citizenship to them (Bangladeshis). Who will take responsibility? Telangana CM KCR or Rahul Gandhi?,” he asked, while addressing a meeting to commemorate Sant Ravidas Jayanthi.

Mr. Reddy minced no words in criticising Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao and demanded that the latter prove in what manner the Citizenship Amendment Act was against 130-crore population of the country.

The Union Minister said some of the country’s leaders had sought citizenship for infiltrators and maintained that the Centre was ready to review the CAA. Claiming that the CAA was brought in to help certain persecuted communities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, Mr. Reddy questioned the rationale behind the demand of some political parties to give citizenship to Muslims of these countries.

He opined that refugees and infiltrators should not be treated alike and faulted the Congress for favouring citizenship to infiltrators from Bangladesh and Pakistan. He pointed out that some refugees had been staying in India for more than four decades without any facilities and documents.

192,2020/02/09,OGH doctors use rare method to save infant,"An 18-month-old girl who survived with fractured jaw after the infant’s father allegedly killed her mother and ended his life was operated upon by Osmania General Hospital doctors through a method rarely used on patients there. Because of the girl’s age, hole in her heart, and fracture in jaw, the usual method employed to administer anaesthesia could not be used. Rather than intubation by inserting a tube through mouth, they inserted it through her nose.

On January 29, M Madhu allegedly killed his wife Akhila, grievously injured the infant and ended his life. The family lived in Ramdas Thanda, Nampally, of Nalgonda district. When the police reached the spot, they found the infant struggling for life. The police suspected that the girl might have been injured accidentally.

She was admitted to Niloufer Hospital. After preliminary treatment, she was referred to OGH where doctors ruled out injury to the brain and suggested plastic surgery for facial fractures.

OGH chief anaesthesiologist R Pandu Naik said that to control respiration when patient is under anaesthesia, they insert an endotracheal tube into trachea through mouth. The process is called intubation. Since the infant’s mouth had injury, they had to insert it through nose.

“However, when we intubate through nose, we will not be able to see where the tube is going. So we took a Fibre Optic Bronchoscope which has a camera at its end, enveloped it with the endotracheal tube. This way, we were able to see where the tube is going.

193,2020/02/09,Cloudy weather plunges peak power demand in Telangana,"An unexpected change in the weather conditions across the State has plunged the peak demand of power by over 2,350 MW in less than 24 hours — from 11,278 MW on February 8 to around 9,000 MW on February 9 forcing the Telangana State Power Generation Corporation to go for back down in generation in its thermal stations on Sunday.

According to officials, the peak power demand in the State has been 10,000 MW or more since December 16 last with the farmers taking up rabi cultivation in a record extent of about 15.6 lakh hectares, including paddy in over 10.35 lakh hectares.

“The peak demand has clocked 11,000 MW or more on 15 days since January 15 as the paddy transplantation has been going on in top-gear,” a Transco official engaged in monitoring the demand-supply said.

“Backing down the generation in old units is a regular practice whenever there is a huge fluctuation in demand, particularly in the units which have higher variable costs due to their low efficiency. It is necessary to maintain the costs low and also to honour the contracted purchases,” the official explained.

Minimum load

The minimum load clocked on the system on Sunday was less than 7,300 MW taking the variation between it and the peak load of the previous day to around 4,000 MW.

According to the weather department, cloudy weather caused by the interaction of moist easterly winds from Bay of Bengal and cold and dry westerly winds from North India is expected to continue for the next two days with the forecast of light to moderate rain at isolated places over northern and central districts. Thereafter, it would be mainly dry weather.

Groundwater

The energy demand is expected to pick up again and peak during the grain formation stage (paddy) in late-February and March when most of the nearly 25 lakh borewells in the State are expected to pump groundwater as the average groundwater table in January this year has been noticed to be three metres higher when compared to January 2019.

According to the Groundwater Department, the average groundwater level in January this year is 8.88 meter below the ground level against 11.88 meters in January last year.

Peak demand

The power utilities are expecting the peak demand to go beyond 12,500 MW during the ensuing summer and the consumption of energy beyond 250 million units a day.

The highest peak demand clocked on the system was on August 30 last year, when it was recorded 11,703 MW with the consumption of nearly 242 million units.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/p7lawv/article30777326.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY09WEATHER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cloudy-weather-plunges-peak-power-demand-in-telangana/article30777327.ece
194,2020/02/09,Six police officers’ arrest in three weeks on corruption charges raises eyebrows,"Police personnel getting caught on corruption charges is not completely unheard of. Yet six police officers of the State, including an Additional Superintendent of Police, landing behind the bars within three weeks over graft accusations is surely unusual.

All of them were sent to prison, having been remanded in judicial custody. If the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials, who arrested them in three different graft cases, prove the charges in the court of law, they might lose their jobs permanently.

The three cases were different. The first one reported on December 20, 2019 was that of ASP G. Narasimha Reddy, working as Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police of Siddipet. Selected as SI during first ever special recruitment for Intelligence wing, Mr. Reddy got accelerated promotions for his ‘commendable’ work.

ACB’s official communication said on the day of his arrest that his assets worth over ₹5 crore were disproportionate to his known sources of income. The corruption case curtails his chances of promotion as Superintendent of Police.

A person recruited as SI in police department retires mostly as Deputy Superintendent of Police or ASP. With close to six years service still left, he had fair chance of getting promoted as non-cadre SP and heading a district. The disproportionate assets case apparently shattered his career aspirations and cast shadow on his ‘previous successes’ .

The arrest of three police officers — constable and writer of Gambhirraopet police station in Sircilla-Rajanna district Kanakaraju, SI Anil Kumar and Yellareddypet Circle Inspector Lingamurthy — in a single case of bribery in Sircilla-Rajanna district was reported on this January 3. They were accused of demanding ₹25,000 from a person after he was caught by the CI transporting sand illegally in a van.

They later allegedly agreed to let him off without any case on payment of ₹10,000. The constable, ACB records say, received the bribe while sitting on PS premises. Based on his confession, the SI and Inspector were arrested. If the case ends in conviction, Mr. Anil Kumar’s services would be terminated since he was on probation.

A SI of 2017 batch, Mr. Kumar was caught barely 45 days after he was sent to the police station on probation following completion of training. Recently, the Home Department has issued termination of service of a city SI in a near similar case.

Probationary SI S. Srinivas was caught on bribery charge in 2014 while working in Reinbazar police station of Hyderabad. The case was referred to Commissioner of Inquiries who held him guilty and this resulted in termination of his service.

Less than a week after the Gambhirraopet case, ACB sleuths arrested SI P. Sudheer Reddy of Jubilee Hills PS for “receiving ₹50,000 bribe and two whiskey bottles from a businessman” to help him in a cheating case. The Inspector Balvanthaiah disappeared soon after the SI’s arrest only to surrender before the ACB authorities a couple of days later.

Balvanthaiah was among the police officers against whom an inquiry was ordered over allegations of having connections with slain gangster Nayeemuddin. He later worked as Inspector with Hyderabad Police Commissioner’s Task Force.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/r06hp3/article30777640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10ACB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/six-police-officers-arrest-in-three-weeks-on-corruption-charges-raises-eyebrows/article30776989.ece
195,2020/02/09,Politics and the art of making improbable happen,"A rare sight, by all means!

The inauguration of Green Line (JBS-MGBS Corridor) of the Hyderabad Metro Rail the other day may have extended the hassle-free commuting to the citizens of the City of Pearls, but the event had also made a rare sight possible — Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his most vocal critic and Congress Member of Parliament from Malkajgiri A. Revanth Reddy sharing the dais. The rare sight of the two political rivals in one picture frame was captured by the shutter-bugs with enthusiasm.

The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi left no stone unturned to defeat Mr. Revanth Reddy in the 2018 December Assembly polls and 2019 April Lok Sabha elections, in which the score was egalite as he lost the Assembly election from Kodangal but won the Lok Sabha poll from Malkajgiri. What was more heartening was that Mr. Revanth Reddy was seen chatting with Secunderabad legislator and Deputy Speaker of the Assembly T. Padma Rao with hand-in-hand even as they stood next to the Chief Minister.

CAA, NRC, NPR debate hots up

The ongoing controversy over the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens and National Population Register appears to have become a major bone of contention between the State and the Central governments or at least between the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti and the Bharatiya Janata Party.

While the BJP, ruling at the Centre, had recently made into law the CAA, the TRS had resolved firmly to oppose the Act. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation went ahead to pass a resolution against the CAA and Union Minister G. Kishan Reddy contested the passage of the resolution claiming that parties opposing the Act should come out with specific objections against the provisions, if any, which are not in the interest of the people.

Arguments on the matter continue with sides reaffirming their respective stances, but effort should be made from both the sides to see that public interest or public works are not impacted by the developments.

Additional seats at degree level

Next academic year could see a sea change in courses and strength of seats in degree colleges across the State as the Telangana State Council of Higher Education has invited applications from college managements wanting to avail the facility.

In fact, the seed for the development was sown last year when the government decided to extend the same to colleges that filled at least 60 % of the seats available with them. It was estimated that in all about 20,000 seats would be on offer additionally as each college would get 100 seats more.

In the notification issued by the Council recently, it was suggested that the colleges were free to withdraw courses and opt for change in medium of instruction if they so desired. The withdrawal of courses and medium change was expected to erode 5,000 seats. Hence, the managements have painted a picture that the net gain could be 15,000 seats.

Opportunity smiles on a panchayat clerk

The recent elections to municipal bodies in Telangana saw a woman upstaging her husband though she was a rank outsider to politics till polls.

Mallela Rajasri was a clerk in the gram panchayat of Bheemgal in Nizamabad district where her husband was initially a ward member and later upa-sarpanch. They fell in love and got married. After the gram panchayat was upgraded to a municipality, the post of chairperson of the new body was reserved for women of backward classes. Ms. Rajasri resigned her job to plunge into politics just before elections and went on to win as one of the ward members and also chairpersonship of the municipality as a candidate of the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi. Her husband was left behind as a TRS activist and carrying on with his traditional occupation of agriculture.

197,2020/02/09,Two boys who did Warangal proud at Medaram Jatara,"Until two years ago, 29-year-old Rupesh Chennuri was one among the lakhs of devotees who were waiting for their turn to pray the Sammakka-Sarakka deities up close during biennial Medaram Jatara. Being a native of Warangal, he made it a point to attend the biennial jatara along with his family in his father’s auto-rickshaw or sometimes on bullock carts.

This year too, he attended the jatara but in a different role. The Warangal lad was among the large deployment of police personnel who facilitated the smooth darshan by lakhs of devotees at the biggest public congregation in both the Telugu States.

After chasing his dream of becoming a civil servant, he cracked UPSC examinations and is on the way of becoming an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer. Currently a probationary officer of 2017 batch, Mr. Rupesh is attached to Ramagundam Commissionerate as a trainee.

“We used to wait in long queues, for hours on end every time, to pray to the goddesses. But, during this festival I was one of the persons in-charge of the Gadde (altars). Life has changed a lot,” Mr. Rupesh told The Hindu.

Tough life

Till he got selected for the IPS, his father, Ramanaiah, was an auto-rickshaw driver and his mother, Sarojana, was a beedi worker in Hasanparthy.

“Professionally, Medaram jatara was a challenging task and at the same time it was a great learning experience. I learnt how to manage such large gathering of people in a short time and motivate our men who worked round-the-clock,” he said. The series of interactions with senior officers and their guidance helped them perform well in the designated role, he added.

Similar to Mr. Rupesh, another Warangal lad who experienced a massive shift in dynamics of relationship is 28-year-old IPS trainee officer B. Rohit. He is son of Ashok Raju, an Assistant Sub-Inspector in Warangal Commissionerate, and recalls that he used to address his father’s colleagues as uncle. “Now my uncles address me as ‘Sir’, which I find uncomfortable but, I cannot insist,” he said.

Matter of pride

“It was a great moment for me. I was working with my father’s colleagues and his seniors. Many of them recognised me and waded through the sea of devotees to meet me at my post after darshanam. It was like a homecoming,” said Mr. Rohit, who is currently attached to Bhadradri-Kothagudem district for training.

During the jatara, which is popularly known as ‘Telangana’s Kumbh Mela’, he was in-charge of entrance gates, which includes VIP and VVIP gates.

“For me, it was a great learning experience and being a native of the place, I have a personal attachment which made me get more involved,” Mr. Rohit said.

Apart from Mr. Rupesh and Mr. Rohit, there were nine other probationary officers of 2017 and 2018 batch of IPS and around 10,000 police personnel of various ranks who were deployed at the Medaram jatara this year.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/c8gbm7/article30776600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy09Medaram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/two-boys-who-did-warangal-proud-at-medaram-jatara/article30776602.ece

199,2020/02/09,TRS set to sweep coop polls also,"Telangana State Cooperative Apex Bank (TSCAB) chairman and Karimnagar DCCB chairman K. Ravinder Rao has been elected unopposed as the chairman of the primary agricultural cooperative society (PACS) from Gambhiraopeta mandal in Rajanna-Sircilla district.

Mr. Ravinder Rao had filed his nominations from the Gambhiraopeta society. As no other person had filed the nominations, he was declared elected unopposed. The formal announcement of the election would be announced on Monday. Similarly, DCCB vice chairman V. Mohan Reddy filed his nominations from Almaspur society and DCMS chairman Surender Reddy filed his papers from Narsingapur society. Both Mohan Reddy and Surender Reddy have also been declared elected unopposed following the non-filing nominations by other contestants.

It may be recalled that the Karimnagar DCCB had made strides under the leadership of K. Ravinder Rao during the last one decade. He had also bought reforms in the cooperative sector and ensured that the cooperative banks run in profits in the State as TSCAB chairman. It is learnt that Mr. Ravinder Rao is again in the race for the coveted TSCAB chairman for the continuation of reforms in the cooperative sector and the TRS high command was also showing an inclination towards his candidature.

Incidentally, in all the 125 PACS in the erstwhile Karimnagar district, it was only the TRS candidates who filed their nominations for the chairman and director posts. However, the party leadership is holding parleys with the TRS leaders to ensure unanimous selection of the majority of PACS.

In the erstwhile undivided Karimnagar district, a total of 4,289 nominations were filed for a total of 125 PACS including chairpersons and directors. In the divided Karimnagar district, there are 30 PACS and 921 nominations have been filed.

200,2020/02/09,Retired CI proves innocence in Husnabad Police Station missing weapons case,"Retired Circle Inspector (CI) Dasari Bhumaiah has alleged that higher officials had unnecessarily blamed him and caused mental agony on charges of stealing two weapons after his transfer from Husnabad Police Station in 2017.

Talking to newspersons here on Sunday, he said two weapons, an AK-47, and a carbine, including a weapon used by his gunman were missing after his transfer from Husnabad Police Station. But technically a case was registered against him. “The weapons disappeared from the police station as there was no guard and the “well of the arms” was not locked properly by the officials concerned,” he said. The former CI alleged that police personnel working in Husnabad then had unnecessarily blamed him for their mistakes.

No action against the guilty

“Now, that the accused Sadanandam had come out with a weapon stolen from the police station and fired at his neighbour in Akkannapet village in Siddipet district recently, the issue of missing weapons has come to the light. If Sadanandam had not come out with the weapon, I would have been blamed for forever for stealing the weapons,” he stated.

Further, Mr. Bhumaiah expressed shock and concern over officials not taking any action against the guilty in the missing weapons case. “If one bullet goes missing, there will be serious action. But two sophisticated weapons have been missing since 2017, and no action is initiated against the accused,” he complained. “If the weapons had reached terrorists or naxalites, it would have been disastrous,” he feared.

Seeks justice

Appreciating present officials for probing into the missing weapons case, he urged them to conduct an impartial inquiry and provide justice to him and punish the guilty. “The State government should not extend the services of retired police officials as they would resort to all illegal works to appease the government,” opined the former CI.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/retired-ci-proves-innocence-in-husnaban-ps-missing-weapons-case/article30776042.ece

205,2020/02/09,TRS leaders lambast BJP over turmeric board issue,"The Union government’s announcement of a regional extension centre of Spices Board in Nizamabad instead of agreeing to the long-cherished dream of a turmeric board has created a major controversy with leaders of the ruling TRS and the BJP trading charges over the issue.

The TRS and farmer organisations have criticised BJP MP D. Arvind for failing to ensure a turmeric board and ₹15,000 per quintal of turmeric. They also pointed to the instance of him executing a personal bond where he said he would quit Parliament if he did not get the turmeric board constituted within five days of his election as MP. The BJP leaders, for their part, maintain that the regional centre is ‘much more’ than a board.

TRS MLA Bajireddy Govardhan has demanded the MP’s resignation since he got elected on the turmeric board factor, but ‘deceived’ farmers eventually.

Of the total 14 lakh metric tonnes of turmeric being produced in the country, 7 lakh tonnes is produced only in the Telugu States and of that, nearly four lakh tonnes in Nizamabad and Jagtial districts alone.

BJP national general secretary Ram Madhav had also promised a turmeric board during his electioneering for the Lok Sabha elections, reminded Mr. Govardhan. “We TRS MLAs under the leadership of ex-MP K. Kavitha had met the Chief Ministers of six States and also Union Ministers on the demand and got their word. We made strenuous efforts to achieve the board. But, unfortunately Ms. Kavitha was defeated in the elections,” he added.

Minister for Roads and Buildings V. Prashanth Reddy sought to know when turmeric farmers in Kerala did not get remunerative prices despite the State having the Spices Board office, how could farmers in Telangana get benefits with a regional extension centre. Spices Board has regional offices in 16 centres across the country, he said and added that such offices exist in Secunderabad for 30 years and Warangal for 20 years.

Nowhere at the regional centres are farmers getting minimum support price, he asserted. Unless a separate turmeric board is set up, turmeric farmers would not get benefit, the Minister pointed out. Meanwhile, AIKMS and other farmers’ associations have also made it clear that nothing short of a turmeric board would be acceptable to them.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-leaders-lambast-bjp-over-turmeric-board-issue/article30772663.ece

207,2020/02/09,‘BSP will rename Bhadohi as Sant Ravidas Nagar’,"Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Sunday said if voted to power in Uttar Pradesh, her party will rename Bhadohi as Sant Ravidas Nagar.

In a statement issued in New Delhi, she said, “As soon as the BSP comes to power (in Uttar Pradesh), it will rename Bhadohi as Sant Ravidas Nagar. The previous Samajwadi Party government had changed its name due to its casteist mentality.”

Ms. Mayawati accused the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party of never honouring saint-poet Ravidas during their tenures and indulging in “theatrics” now by visiting temples.

‘List of work’

Listing the work done by the BSP to keep the memory of Ravidas alive, she said, “Sant Ravidas Park and Ghat were made in Varanasi, his place of birth, his statue was installed in Varanasi and the Ravidas Samman Puraskar constituted. The Santguru Ravidas Rajkiya Mahavidyalay was established in Faizabad. Apart from this, Sant Ravidas Polytechnic was established in Chandauli. A bridge on river Ganga was named after the saint. Assistance was given for Sant Ravidas Dharamshala in Badaun.”

The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister’s assertion to rename Bhadohi as Sant Ravidas Nagar came close on the heels of a proposal to change the name of Basti, a district located in the eastern parts of the State, after Maharishi Vashishth.

The District Magistrate of Basti, Ashutosh Niranjan, had said the proposal to change the district’s name was sent to the revenue board and the expenditure for it was pegged at around ₹1 crore.

The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has changed the name of Allahabad to Prayagraj and that of Faizabad to Ayodhya.

It has also renamed the Mughalsarai railway station after Deen Dayal Upadhyay.

CM’s announcement

208,2020/02/09,"Women playing prominent role in anti-CAA, NRC protests","The polite rejection of the advice of the Vice-Chancellor of Darul Uloom Deoband by women protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens in the Idgah ground for the last 14 days has revealed how Muslim women are not only fighting to save the Constitution, they are also grappling with a social battle within the community.

Maulana Abul Qasim Nomani had advised the women to give up their protest for the time being during a meeting with the district administration.

“We came out only when the clergy and the political parties failed us. We respect the Mohatamim but we didn’t take Darul Uloom’s permission to start the sit-in protest. Why would we take it back on their advice,” asks Fouzia, one of the five women, who formed the Murtahida Khawatin Committee that is guiding the protest. Such was the impact that the seminary had to issue a clarification within 24 hours that it was not against the protest.

“It took us 20 days to convince women around us to come out in protest of this kala kanoon (black law) that threatens our existence in the country which our forefathers chose to live and die for,” says the postgraduate in Political Science. “Agar aaj ghar se nahin nikalenge, toh kal desh se nikal diye jayenge (If we don’t come out of homes today, tomorrow we would be thrown out of the country),” she says.

‘Beginning of a new era’

Young Faizy Usmani, whose aunt and cousins are protesting, says it is the beginning of a “new era”. “Many men are discovering the latent talent of their women during these protests as many of us never thought they could hold stage so convincingly,” he says.

Iram Usmani, who runs a primary school, says they were getting complete support from family members. “But, we don’t allow men on stage during the protest because we follow purdah system. We take their message in writing and one of us read it out to the audience,” says Ms. Usmani. When the instant Triple Talaq was criminalised, she remarks, PM Modi described it as empowering legislation for Muslim women. “We didn’t protest even though it was against the Shariat. Why is his government, doubting our intentions and intelligence now when we are protesting to save our Constitution,” she wonders.

‘No support of clergy’

Similarly, in Aligarh’s Shahjamal area hundreds of burqa-clad women are sitting on protest for more than 15 days. Mostly from poor and lower-middle-class families, their concern is that they might not have the papers to pass the NRC test. Maryam, a young woman felt that the clergy didn’t stand with them after a couple of days. “The Mufti was under so much pressure of the administration that he could not take a stand when we went to see a detained journalist who had come to cover our protest,” she says.

The male family members don’t join the protest but they keep an eye on the protesters. They often don’t allow media persons to talk to women as they feel they might say something that is against the movement.

In this part of the world, there is a common tendency among men to describe a group of women discussing something as “chen chen kar rahin hain”. “It could be loosely translated as making noise. But with the anti-CAA-NRC protest, it has become a voice,” says Ayesha Munira, professor of English in Aligarh Muslim University.

Prof. Munira, who specialises in gender studies, feels the protests are “life-changing” and “empowering” for many Muslim women, particularly from weaker sections. “They have come out on their own. Once the protest ends, patriarchy will try to take over again but I don’t think women will be easily relegated to four walls. They know their voices are being heard by the country and they are leading a movement.”

This, she says, could have made many maulanas “insecure”. “The right-wingers on both sides share common traits. They feel women have no agency. Women are resisting both, as it is a matter of survival for their families,” she says.

Feeling the heat

The district authorities in these cities are also feeling the heat because they don’t know how to engage with the women in burqa. Talking to senior police officers in Saharanpur and Aligarh reveal involving clergy in negotiating with women was not as effective as it was with men during the December 20 protests.

“The clergy had a role in instant Triple Talaq, but it was ignored. In CAA-NRC, where they have no role, they are being pressurised to issue appeals. Those in power in Delhi and U.P. don’t have to negotiate with women in their family life. How will they negotiate with us? Still, we are waiting,” says a protester in Aligarh.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9xz3zi/article30777617.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09AMU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/women-playing-prominent-role-in-anti-caa-nrc-protests/article30777618.ece
209,2020/02/09,BJP-JJP regime clueless about its agenda of governance: Hooda,"Former Haryana Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday hit out at ruling BJP-JJP government in the State, accusing it of being clueless about its agenda of governance even after three months in power.

Mr. Hooda said the government should not only give an account of what it has achieved in the first 100 days of its second term but also list its failures for all the 1925 days that it has held office.

“The State government is clueless about what needs to be done. They are busy with settling the internal contradictions of their alliance and the party. They took almost 20 days to distribute portfolios and then they started fighting over who controls CID. Now they have started carrying out pre-budget discussions while the economic survey itself has not been released. The government has done nothing and this is why their 100-day progress report is nothing but a pack of lies,” said Mr. Hooda.

The former Chief Minister said not only does the government not want to work, it is also not allowing the 90 Haryana MLAs to work. “The MLAs are given a grant of ₹5 crore per year but they have not been able to spend the money because the government has not issued any guidelines for this expenditure and people of the State continue to suffer,” he alleged.

“The State was growing by nearly 10% during the Congress rule but this has come down to 4.5%. Unemployment rate in the State was 2.8% during the Congress government which has now gone up by more than 10 times to 28%,” he said.

Calling the government move to secure 75% of unskilled jobs for locals a political posturing, the former Chief Minister said this is just an extension of existing government policies and this alone was not acceptable to the State. “Our educated young women and men are only getting class IV jobs and those who deserve to be placed as teachers, are being appointed as peons which is gross injustice to their ability and academic records,” Mr. Hooda said.

Scam alleged

The former Chief Minister alleged scam by the government in the procurement of paddy.

“The government’s own investigations have identified a scam of ₹90 crore but Ministers are claiming that there has been no scam. We want the CBI or a sitting judge to probe this so that the scale of the scam and those responsible are exposed,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7k6c19/article30777608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE09-HOODA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-jjp-regime-clueless-about-its-agenda-of-governance-hooda/article30777609.ece
210,2020/02/09,Bareilly gets back its ‘jhumka’ at last,"Jhumka and Bareilly became synonymous after a 1966 chart-buster on the jewellery in which actor Sadhana gave a feisty dance performance. The city has finally got a fanciful 14-ft ‘jhumka’, embellished with colourful stones and the city’s famous ‘zari’ embroidery, installed and is expected to be a major attraction among visitors.

The Asha Bhosle song ‘Jhumka gira re, Bareilly ki bazzar mein’ immortalised the connection between the city and the piece of jewellery. Also known as Manjha city, Bareilly has been manufacturing kite-strings for over a century, but the jhumka has carved out a niche, prompting the Bareilly Development Authority to conceive the project.

Unveiling the structure, Union Minister and Bareilly MP Santosh Gangwar said visitors would finally be able to associate the landmark jhumka in the city with the evergreen song.

“I had never been here in the past. But I have definitely heard Jhumka gira rey,” he said. He recalled another Bhosle song ‘Surma bareilly waala [kohl manufactured in Bareilly], ankhiyon mein aisa daala’ from film Kismat.

Inaugurating the structure, Mr. Gangwar said, “The collaborative effort made by the authority, various organisations and local residents in setting up the ambitious jhumka in Bareilly is commendable. It looks beautiful and unique.”

“In Parliament, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad in lighter vein used to ask me whether Bareilly’s ‘jhumkaa’ has been found or not. Now, I will tell him that Bareilly has got its jhumka”.

Officials said the project has cost the BDA around ₹18 lakh — ₹8 lakh for the jhumka and ₹10 lakh for the beautification of the landscape surrounding the main structure.

The location, design and decoration were decided by the authority. It employed skilled artisans, who worked diligently ensuring that the jhumka becomes a major attraction for the tourists.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/er9lpq/article30777581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10JHUMKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bareilly-gets-back-its-jhumka-at-last/article30777582.ece
211,2020/02/09,Record number of Hindu students to sit for school final exam conducted by West Bengal Madrasah Board,"A record number of Hindu students are among the nearly 70,000 expected to sit for the school-leaving examination of the West Bengal Madrasah Board from Monday.

Nearly 18% of the students registered for the High Madrasah examination, or Standard X examination, are Hindus. In 2019, 12.77% of the students who appeared for the examination were non-Muslim, said Abu Taher Kamruddin, president of the West Bengal Madrasah Education Board.

“In the past couple of years, we are witnessing a 2%-3% rise in the number of students appearing for the examination,” he said. But the figure usually comes down “a little” because not all the registered students will sit for the examination, he told The Hindu. “Even then, the final figure is expected to be 2-3% more than last year’s.”

A large number of students have enrolled themselves in Madrasahs up to Class X, challenging the misconception that only Muslim students study in these institutions. “In Purulia, Birbhum and Bankura districts, we have four big Madrashas, where non-Muslim students outnumber the Muslim students,” Mr. Kamruddin said.

The Madrasah education started in 1780 in Bengal. It was reformed in 1851. It follows the Secondary Education Board’s syllabus “almost entirely”.

The school education under the Madrasah Board has two streams: the High Madrasah, where Arabic is optional, and Senior Madrasah, which teaches theology. “The non-Muslims mainly enrol themselves in High Madrasah as it follows the Secondary Board’s syllabus,” Mr. Kamruddin said.

An observer of primary education said the number of students under the Secondary Board is huge, a reason enough for parents to admit their children to schools under the Madrasah Board, especially in rural areas. There are over 600 government-funded Madrasahs in the State. They were studied in the past by experts from across the world for their unique characteristics. One of them is to admit girls.

“Last year, a little less than 60% students, both Muslims and non-Muslims, who appeared for the examination, were girls,” Mr. Kamruddin said. Experts say the drop-out rate among the boys, however, remains very high.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nf76p3/article30777403.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10MUSLIMMADRASSA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/record-hindu-students-to-sit-for-school-final-exam-in-madrasahs/article30777404.ece

213,2020/02/09,Poacher held in Odisha; confesses to killing 20 tuskers,"Odisha’s Forest Department personnel have arrested a poacher who reportedly confessed to having killed 20 elephants, mostly tuskers, in his lifetime.

Babuli Mahalik, a shooter in a wildlife smuggling gang, was caught based on a tip-off.

“After receiving information about the smuggling gang, we had constituted a team which was tasked to follow its members in disguise. He [Mahalik] was finally picked up from his home in Durgaprasad village near Narsinghpur in Cuttack,” said Sasmita Lenka, Divisional Forest Officer, Athagarh.

Deer skins, antlers and a country-made guns were seized from his possession. The gang used to follow elephant herds before zeroing in on one tusker. “They generally set up camp deep inside the forest or atop a hillock to keep a tab on the herd. They then separate a tusker from its herd and shoot down the animal at an isolated spot,” Ms. Lenka said.

The poacher charged ₹30,000 for every bullet he shot. Mahalik was arrested from Boudh district for a wildlife crime in 2019. “During the interrogation, he confessed to having killed 20 elephants in the past. In 2018, he and his accomplices were responsible for the beheading of two elephants in our division,” Ms. Lenka said.

The crime branch of the Odisha police were also investigating the poaching of two elephants in Athagarh.

The gang is known to sell tusks in the neighbouring Nayagarh district. Forest Department officials have expanded their probe to find out how the gang operates.

In another case, two persons were arrested by the Forest Department officials for their alleged involvement in an elephant poaching case in Subarnapur district on Saturday.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/poacher-held-in-odisha-confesses-to-killing-20-tuskers/article30777444.ece
214,2020/02/09,"Stone for stone, sword for sword, Raj Thackeray tells anti-CAA protesters","Announcing his support to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) leader Raj Thackeray on Sunday threatened those opposing these measures to get ready for retaliation through stones and swords.

“Today’s march is an answer to those who have been organising protests against the CAA and the NRC. You will get a march as an answer to your march. But let me warn you, stones will be answered with stones and swords will be answered with swords,” he said in an address to party workers at the Azad Maidan at the end of a march.

“I have never understood the reason for Muslims protesting against the CAA and the NRC. It is to show their strength. This march is to show our strength. I have nothing against Indian Muslims but there are certain ‘mohallas’ in different parts of the State which have become the hub of illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh, which need to be cleaned,” he said.

Thousands of party workers gathered at Hindu Gymkhana at Marine Drive in south Mumbai marched to Azad Maidan, where no other leader than Mr. Thackeray spoke.

Earlier in the day, MNS leader Sandip Deshpande said workers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak sangh (RSS) had also participated in the march.

Sporting the party’s new saffron flag on his right bicep, Mr. Thackeray said that accepting non-Muslims from Pakistan and Bangladesh was nothing wrong while supporting the CAA. “I have criticised the BJP government for wrong deeds, but at the same time I have applauded its steps like scrapping of Article 370. The CAA is limited to giving citizenship to non-Muslims from neighbouring countries and there is nothing wrong in it,” he said.

But he said the country could not sustain if illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries continued to reside here, and therefore a pan-India NRC must be implemented. “I will support if you want to implement it here. The government is now saying it has not decided on the NRC. But if you want to do it, then do it sternly,” he said. India could not be seen as ‘dharmashala,’ especially when many western countries were sending out illegal immigrants.

He called Pakistan a terror hub and pointed to the Mumbai blasts to drive home his support for the NRC.

Mr. Thackeray’s rhetoric of answering the protests against the CAA and NRC in the same coin is similar to his 2008 speech which kicked off the party’s violent attacks against north Indians in Mumbai and surrounding areas. It led to his arrest and filing of several cases against him. But the legal action helped his party in the 2009 Maharashtra Assembly election, where the MNS won 13 seats in its début, affecting the Shiv Sena’s prospects in several urban seats.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/k6u2qa/article30777428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10RALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/stone-for-stone-sword-for-sword-raj-thackeray-tells-anti-caa-protesters/article30777429.ece
215,2020/02/09,"J&K administration offers investors ‘uninterrupted’ Internet, WiFi access","The Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) government is highlighting good quality air and low crime rate in the newly created Union Territory to attract investors.

As per the J&K Information Technology (IT) Policy 2020, the administration is offering an incentive to IT companies to operate in three-shifts and to facilitate women working during the night by provided transportation and security. At least 15% of “plug and play” premises in designated IT parks will be reserved for women entrepreneurs, the policy says. The policy document says J&K contributes only 0.1% of the total cognisable crimes under the Indian Penal Code.

The policy document shared with investors says that two IT parks with an area of five lakh square feet are being developed in Jammu and Srinagar which will have “dedicated and uninterrupted broad band connectivity and wi-fi access.”

Investment opportunities in 14 sectors in the Union Territory were unveiled at an investor conference in the national capital last month.

Internet has been snapped in the Union Territory since August 5 last year when Home Minister Amit Shah moved two bills in the Rajya Sabha to revoke the special status under Article 370. Following Supreme Court directions, 2G mobile connectivity was restored in J&K last month with access only to 301 government-approved websites.

Connecting panchayats

The policy says that “as a special dispensation for IT units, the land allotment would be decided on top priority” and the government would encourage private sector participants to become Internet service providers to enable high speed Internet connectivity in all panchayats of J&K.

The Real Estate Policy states that a vast land bank owned by the government would be disbursed to “private developers” through a transparent bidding process.

Minister’s assurance

The Home Minister had told a delegation from J&K on September 3 last year that “only government land would be used to establish industries, hospitals and educational institutions” and “nobody's land would be taken away.”

Participating in the debate in Rajya Sabha on August 5, Mr. Shah had said no industry could be set up and tourism could not develop in J&K because of restrictions on land purchase due to Articles 370 and 35A. The two revoked provisions of the Constitution let the J&K Legislature decide the “permanent residents” of the State, prohibiting a non-J&K resident from buying property in the State and ensuring job reservation for its residents. Several groups in Jammu have demanded domicile rights amid fears of losing land and jobs to outsiders.

“The existing land acquisition laws would be amended to incorporate the landowners as stakeholders in the housing development….the authorities without going into the compulsory land acquisition will either partner with private players on equity basis or facilitate land assembly by acquisition or pooling through private players as done by other development authorities in other States,” the policy said.

The developers will have to reserve 20% dwelling units in group housing projects for economically weaker section and lower income groups.

The UT of J&K is offering 100% exemption on stamp duty, land use charge, permission, construction and processing fee for the housing for Economically Weaker Section and LIG groups.

The policy says that government will persuade the National Housing Bank, HUDCO, financial institutions, commercial banks and insurance sector to extend the network of operations in J&K to provide affordable housing credit to people.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/elztj4/article30776697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THRDKASHMIR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jk-govt-offers-investors-uninterrupted-internet-access/article30776698.ece

Firecrackers, being carried in a tractor trolley, exploded during the ‘nagar kirtan’ (religious procession) near Pahu village in Tarn Taran on Saturday, February 8.

“One more youth, identified as Gurkirat Singh, passed away in a hospital on Sunday,” Acting Deputy Superintendent of Police, Tarn Taran city, Parbesh Chopra, said. He said the condition of another injured boy was serious and he was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit.

Earlier on Saturday, two boys, aged 12 and 17 years, were killed and nine others injured in the firecracker explosion. On Saturday, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh ordered a magisterial probe into the incident and also announced an ex-gratia grant of ₹5 lakh for the kin of the deceased and free treatment to the injured, admitted in the local civil hospital and Guru Nanak Dev Charitable Hospital.

The explosion took place when some youngsters were bursting crackers as part of celebratory fireworks near Daleke Mor, Palasaur. “As they were doing so, the sparks fell on the tractor trolley, which was carrying explosive material — potash and sulphur and firecrackers — that led to an explosion,” a police official said.

The accused have been identified as Santoshi, 50, and Pritam Singh, 20, both residents of Madhya Pradesh’s Morena district. They were arrested on Friday, police said.

Eleven semi-automatic pistols and 10 single-shot pistols with 50 live cartridges were recovered from the accused, the police said, adding that these were brought to the national capital to be supplied to criminals in Delhi-NCR.

“Santoshi and Pritam were apprehended from near the Dilshad Garden Metro Station on Friday after a police team received information that two men were coming to deliver a consignment to criminals,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) P.S. Kushwah said.

A few years ago, Santoshi was arrested after he got into a quarrel with someone and was lodged in Morena jail. In the prison, he came in contact with illegal firearms suppliers. Later, he started procuring illegal arms from them for supplying criminals in Delhi-NCR, he said. The accused would primarily source weapons from Aligarh.

He used to buy .32 bore pistols for ₹7,000 to 8,000 each and single-shot pistols for ₹2,000 to 3,000. He would sell the .32 bore and single-shot pistols for ₹20,000-25,000 and ₹4,000-5,000, respectively, Mr. Kushwah added. Santoshi has been supplying arms and ammunition to criminals for the last four years. Previously, he was arrested in three cases under the Arms Act, he said.

Around 45 passengers in the bus were travelling from Dankalpadu village to Chikarada to attend a pre-wedding function. The groom was travelling in a car. While proceeding on the Golanthara-Tulu road, the metal goods carriage on the top of the AC sleeper bus came into contact with the cable hanging on a side of the narrow village road near Mendarajpur. According to Chief Fire Officer, southern range, Sukant Sethi, the passengers received high voltage shock.

Police and fire officials as well as Ganjam collector, Vijay Amrusta Kulange and Berhampur SP Pinak Mishra rushed to the spot to monitor the rescue operation. All injured were first shifted to MKCG medical college and hospital in Berhampur. Till Sunday evening, nine patients were under treatment in hospital, while nine others with severe burn injuries were shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack. A 11-year-old boy died on the way to Berhampur, increasing the death toll to 10.

Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik expressed condolences and announced an ex gratia of ₹2 lakh to the next of kin of each of the deceased. He announced that all the injured would receive free treatment.

Transport Minister Padmanabh Behera ordered an enquiry assuring that strict action would be taken against the persons found guilty. He blamed the cable and the driver for the accident. The residents of Mendarajpur alleged that no action had been taken despite their repeated complains about the cable.

Chairman and Managing Director (CMD) of the Odisha Power Transmission Corporation Limited (OPTCL) Sourabh Garg sought a report from SOUTHCO.

Penalty will also be imposed on vendors who do not take necessary initiatives — separate dustbins for dry and wet waste and use of permissible plastic bags — the official said.

The fine will be in the range of ₹100 to ₹5,000, depending on the nature of the offence, he said.

For almost every category of offence, the fines have been hiked by at least ₹100.

The move was taken in line with the Centre’s Swachh Bharat Mission and a National Green Tribunal order, which asked the railways to put in place a mechanism to fix accountability on individuals regarding waste disposal and littering, the official said.

Along with RPF officers, station masters, ticket collectors and railway officials have been authorized to detect and penalise offenders across all three ECoR divisions — Khurda Road, Sambalpur and Waltair.

The official also said that ECoR earlier had different penalties for different stations, but now uniformity would be maintained across the three divisions.

“For the first time, there will be uniformity in fines imposed on offenders across all stations of ECoR . The revised rates will come into effect from Monday,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/31hciq/article30775784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CLEANESTRAILWAYSTATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/penalty-for-violation-of-cleanliness-rules-hiked-east-coast-railway/article30775785.ece
221,2020/02/09,"Afzal Guru’s death anniversary: Mobile Internet snapped in Kashmir, restored later","Authorities on Sunday snapped mobile Internet services in Kashmir as a precautionary measure to prevent any law and order disturbance on the seventh death anniversary of Parliament attack convict Mohammad Afzal Guru, officials said.

The mobile Internet services were suspended early in the morning as the authorities apprehended violence in the valley in view of the bandh call given by separatist outfits, the officials said.

The services were restored in the evening, they added.

The authorities had restored 2G Internet services in Kashmir on January 25, more than five months after snapping all communication facilities in the valley following abrogation of Article 370 on August 5 last year.

Police on Saturday lodged an FIR against the banned Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) for calling a strike on Afzal Guru’s death anniversary.

Guru was hanged in 2013 inside Tihar jail for his role in the Parliament attack in December 2001.

Two journalists were summoned by police for reporting the JKLF press release, which had called for strike on Sunday and Tuesday — the death anniversary of the outfit founder Mohammad Maqbool Bhat.

The journalists were let off after five hours of questioning. Bhat was hanged in 1984 and is buried inside Tihar jail.

Meanwhile, normal life in Kashmir was affected due to the strike, the officials said.

Markets and business establishments remained closed, while public transport was largely off the roads, they said.

222,2020/02/09,Mohali building collapse: Debris removal operations at site,"Debris removal operations were on at the site where a three-storey building collapsed in Punjab’s Mohali district, with officials on Sunday saying there were slim chances of anyone still trapped under the fallen structure.

One person was killed in the incident and two others were injured after the commercial building collapsed on Saturday afternoon.

“The debris is being removed from the site. NDRF officials told us that no one appears to be still trapped under the debris. However, NDRF is still on standby for the moment just in case the need arises,” Kharar’s Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) Himanshu Jain said.

District administration authorities and police have checked with the contractor and company officials at the site and were told that no labour or any employee of theirs was missing.

Taking serious note of the building collapse, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had asked the Mohali Additional District Magistrate to conduct a thorough probe into the incident and submit his report within a week.

A JCB machine driver died in the incident, Mohali Deputy Commissioner Girish Dayalan had said. The body of Harvinder Singh was taken out by rescuers late on Saturday evening.

The commercial building collapsed when a JCB machine was digging an adjoining plot for construction of a basement, Jain had said.

The officials said the heavy earth moving machine might have hit the foundation of the building, but added that the exact cause of the incident would be known after the inquiry.

Three persons were rescued on Saturday, officials had said.

A 30-member team of the National Disaster Response Force was earlier engaged in the rescue operation and one more NDRF team from Ludhiana was also called.

Mr. Dayalan had said that the SDM of Kharar has been ordered to inquire into the incident.

“How did this happen and did they (builder) have requisite permission to do this will be known only after the inquiry,” said Mr. Dayalan.

The probe would also ascertain if the construction was illegal or not, a state government statement had said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/s1gh82/article30775365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOHALI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mohali-building-collapse-debris-removal-operations-at-site/article30775366.ece
223,2020/02/09,"Ahead of mega rally, Pune MNS workers seen travelling in bus owned by BJP MLA","The Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS)’s mega-rally in Mumbai to drive out ‘infiltrators’ from Bangladesh and Pakistan has reinforced speculation of covert support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) after MNS workers from Pune were seen travelling in a vehicle which bore the name of a BJP legislator from the Pimpri-Chinchwad area.

On Sunday, as droves of MNS activists set out from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad to participate in a massive rally called by Mr. Raj Thackeray in Mumbai’s Azad Maidan, some party workers were seen travelling in a luxury bus that bore the name of BJP leader and Bhosari MLA Mahesh Landge.

Some activists, who claimed to be BJP workers, said they were participating in the rally of their own accord and were seen travelling in buses from Pune along with the MNS activists.

Mr. Landge, on his part, denied that the BJP was providing vehicles for ferrying MNS activists and clarified that it was plausible that some activists may have hired a bus belonging to his personal transport firm.

“I own a transport business which provides buses and vehicles to other firms. It is quite likely that these [MNS] workers may have hired one such bus. Let me make it clear that this vehicle is not the BJP’s but owned by my transport company,” he said.

Speaking on BJP workers from Pune allegedly joining the MNS rally, Mr. Landge said he personally was not aware of any of his party activists participating in the event.

At the same time, he remarked: “But if indeed some BJP workers are participating in the MNS rally, it is for a good cause as our party has been fighting to bring about the CAA and implement the NRC.”

While top MNS leaders like Bala Nandgaonkar vehemently denied that the BJP was sponsoring their party’s rally, he said the MNS had not ‘invited’ any political party or outfit to join in the agitation.

“If members of other outfits and political parties are joining us in this rally, they are doing so because they know this cause taken by Mr. [Raj] Thackeray is a patriotic one,” he said.

After spiritedly campaigning against the BJP in the Lok Sabha election last year, the MNS’ change of ideological direction, symbolised by recent its adoption of a saffron flag incorporating Chhatrapati Shivaji’s royal seal or ‘Rajmudra’, has sparked talk of Mr. Raj Thackeray’s party inching ever closer to the BJP.

Hindutva space

Mr. Raj Thackeray’s hobnobbing with BJP leaders such as Ashish Shelar is seen as an attempt on part of the MNS to seize the vacant Hindutva space following the ideologically opposed alliance of Uddhav Thackeray’s Shiv Sena with the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress to keep the BJP out of power in Maharashtra.

The mega-rally is being seen as another attempt by Mr. Raj Thackeray to rebuild his party’s sagging fortunes in the State, which has been on the wane since 2012.

Despite notching impressive performances in the 2012 polls to the Pune and Nashik civic bodies (being once the dominant power in the Nashik Municipal Corporation), internal bickering and haphazard campaigning has caused the party to implode with many among its top brass defecting to the ruling BJP or the Sharad Pawar-led NCP.

While MNS activists congregated in Mumbai from all parts of the State, the largest droves of party workers came from Nashik and Pune.

Twin debacles

Mr. Raj Thackeray’s decline and fall commenced with the MNS’ twin debacles in the 2014 Parliamentary and Assembly elections which left the party in utter disarray.

Its woes were compounded following its total rout in the civic polls held in February 2017, causing many to write off Mr. Raj Thackeray — and the MNS — as a major political force in the State.

While his party did not contest the 2019 Lok Sabha election, Mr. Raj Thackeray’s spirited campaigning for the Congress and the NCP in the general election this year had come a cropper, with the BJP-Sena candidates winning with huge margins in the very constituencies that the MNS chief held his rallies.

In the State Assembly polls in October last year, Mr. Raj Thackeray finally entered the poll arena and contested 100 seats, winning only one (Kalyan Rural).",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/j5bqmj/article30775380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MNS-rallyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ahead-of-mega-rally-pune-mns-workers-seen-travelling-in-bus-owned-by-bjp-mla/article30775332.ece
224,2020/02/09,"BJP supporters, anti-CAA group clash at book fair","Violence erupted at the International Kolkata Book Fair on Saturday when a group of civil rights activists began protesting against Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rahul Sinha who visited the venue. A scuffle broke out between the BJP supporters and protesters against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) when Mr. Sinha visited the stall of the Bharatiya Janbarta.

Police personnel deployed at the venue had to intervene to control the situation. Video footage aired by local television channels showed the protesters, including students, clashing with the police. In some videos, the police are seen beating the protesters. Several protesters were taken into police custody.

Ranajit Sur, vice-president of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights, a civil rights organisation, said the police had “deliberately attacked the protesters.”

“Something like this has never happened at the book fair. We had no plans of protests. Only a few people were raising slogans,” Mr. Sur said. Police closed gate number 7, one of the main gates to enter the venue.

Later in the evening, the protesters who were detained allegedly assaulted the police. Videos from Biddhannagar North Police Station, where the protesters were taken after the violence, showed a few protesters assaulting a policewoman.

BJP leader Rahul Sinha said he would not comment on the protesters as it would mean giving them undue credit. “Our fight is with the Trinamool Congress. The people have discarded them [the Left parties]. We are not fools to allow them to steal the limelight by getting into a fight with them,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mvs414/article30771835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOOK-03,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-supporters-anti-caa-group-clash-at-book-fair/article30771836.ece
225,2020/02/09,M.P.’s plan to raise RTI query fee by 10 times draws activists’ ire,"The Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, which rode to power after a long wait on several scams unravelled during the former BJP regime through the Right to Information Act (RTI), 2005, is planning to raise the fee to file queries by 10 times.

An informed source within the State Information Commission told The Hindu that a proposal, prepared by the General Administration Department (GAD), plans to jack up the fee for the first appeal from ₹50 to ₹500 and the second appeal from ₹100 to ₹1,000, making it the most expensive to ferret out information from a public authority to check corruption and ensure transparency using the Act.

An official attached with GAD Minister Govind Singh said the proposal hadn’t yet reached him, while the department had already received suggestions from the Commission on it, indicating officials had bypassed the long-held convention of securing the Minister’s approval at both the incipient and the final stages of a proposal. Mr. Singh refused to comment.

“The proposal was prepared by the State government. In any case, it’s their discretion to decide the fee,” said Chief Information Commissioner A.K. Shukla. The source there said it had suggested the government bring down the proposed raise to ₹50 instead, and leave untouched the price to procure photocopies of documents at ₹2, which the government had proposed to raise too.

Dharnendra Kumar Jain, Deputy Secretary, GAD, refusing to divulge details including the rationale behind the proposal, said: “The proposal is under consideration and its contents will be made public only after it’s finalised. We’ve not yet decided on the extent of the fee raise.”

The raise to ₹100 had been proposed despite the Supreme Court in 2018 capping the fee per application at ₹50 and per photocopy at ₹5, an order applicable to all government authorities. The Act, not prescribing the fee, leaves it to the governments to make rules for it.

“The Congress government at the Centre is credited with enacting the Act, and its government in Madhya Pradesh is now scripting its undoing,” said Ajay Dubey, Bhopal-based RTI activist and Board Member, Transparency International India.

In its manifesto ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Congress had promised voters it would review the Act to omit provisions that may have diluted it and add provisions to strengthen it.

Stating that the Act’s implementation was shoddy already and in a shambles, Mr. Dubey said Madhya Pradesh was the only State where the Chief Minister’s and the Chief Secretary’s offices didn’t have a public information officer. Moreover, it has exempted the Lokayukta police from it and the Commission’s website hadn’t been functioning for months, denying applicants information on appeal status.

“With the change of guard at the Centre, even Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn’t tinker with the fee and the Act’s execution,” he said. “The Congress took documents procured through Act from us to have an edge during the election. Now, it is directly attacking the common man.” Scams in the Vyapam, the State Public Service Commission, online recruitment, mining and political recommendations in police had been uncovered using the Act.

Nikhil Dey of the National Campaign for People’s Right to Information said the proposal must be fought on all fronts. “It’s unprecedented. Even ₹10 for an application is merely symbolic as it’s the government’s duty to give information under the Act.”

In any case, the government must provide information on its own under the Act, said Abhay Jain, a lawyer in Shivpuri district, who files 20-25 queries a month. “The proposal is an attack on the right of people to know what the government is up to.”

Several States and the Centre charge no fee to file appeals, said Rolly Shivhare, an activist in Bhopal. “The poor file queries in small villages to secure their rights. Instead of reducing the fee, the government plans to increase it, which is abominable and an attempt to snatch their basic rights.”

A senior official at the Commission said if the motive was revenue generation, the government must focus on recovering outstanding fine running into lakhs from officials violating the Act first. “The BJP government in Haryana recovers fine imposed on officials directly from their salaries. But here, we’re planning to discourage people from using the Act. Already, there have been thousands of pending cases since 2015,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5dnl94/article30772109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-859580924,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mps-plan-to-raise-rti-query-fee-by-10-times-draws-activists-ire/article30771589.ece
226,2020/02/09,Fascinating similarities between early medieval Indian copper plates and Scottish charters,"Historians have found fascinating similarities between the early medieval copperplate inscriptions of eastern India and the Parchment charters of Scotland, which were meant for recording the donation of land by the kings/royal officers to religious institutions or individuals. There are generic similarities in the way these early medieval settlement records have been conceived and in their language. While the language in the copperplates in India is Sanskrit, in the case of the Scottish Parchments drawn on cattle skin, the language is Latin.

The details of the study have been published in a book titled Copper, Parchment and Stone: Studies in the sources for landholding and lordship in early medieval Bengal and medieval Scotland, the outcome of a British Academy funded project brought out in November by the Glasgow University Press.

It was during one of the visits to Asiatic Society, when John Reuben Davies, Senior Research Fellow in Scottish History, School of Humanities at University of Glasgow, was struck by the similarities.

“There are striking compositional similarities where the name of the king [donor] and the subject whom the land is awarded [donee] are clearly mentioned,” Prof. Davies said.

Though these early medieval texts were used for similar purposes about 6,000 miles [9,600 km] apart, one is surprised by the stark resemblance they exhibit. “In Sanskrit the word for gift of land is Daanam whereas in Latin it is Donum.” Prof. Davies observed.

While exploring the similarities between these two textual documents spread across 6 CE to 13 CE, Prof. Davies got in touch with Swapna Bhattacharya, a pioneer in the study of comparative significance of Latin and Sanskrit sources, towards understanding the historic polities in Europe and South Asia.

“Our joint project has been an exceptional one, as Indian and European scholars have worked together to explore commonalities between two regions as distant from one another — in many senses — as early medieval Bengal and medieval Scotland. Both belong to the same great ethno-linguistic family of Indo Europeans,” Prof. Bhattacharya, formerly associated with the University of Calcutta (CU), Department of South and South East Asian Studies, wrote in the book.

Both these historical sources display intricate similarities in the way the boundary clauses of each charter or copper plate are delineated, Prof. Rajat Sanyal of the Department of Archaeology, CU, said, explaining that these clauses contain a detailed geographical narrative on the lactation of the gifted land and its surrounding natural and built environs.

The book contains a couple of chapters on boundary clauses. The Indian sources have been dealt with by Prof. Sanyal and Prof. Suchandra Ghosh of the Department of Ancient Indian History and Culture (AIHC, CU), while the Scottish sources are authored by Joana Tucker. Not just the name of the king but also the beneficiary along with his religious affiliation are mentioned in both charters, Prof. Ghosh said. Both types of texts are very important historical sources to understand the rural settlement of the early medieval period.

“A study of boundary clauses allows us to understand the nature of rural settlements of different kinds. The inscriptions from Bengal tell us that even non-Brahmin occupational groups had land holding in the early medieval period,” she added.

Prof. Sayantani Pal of AIHC (CU), who also contributed to the publication running to over 270 pages, said the Indian charter contained a small prasasti (eulogy) segment, their format changing over time. These eulogy sections talk about the genealogy and the political achievements of the king. Prof. Dauvit Broun in his chapter on the genealogy of the Scottish charters has demonstrated, on the other hand, the characteristics of the narratives of the genealogy of the kings.

Prof. Davies said the Scottish charters have a separate eulogy dedicated to a detailed statement on the king’s sovereign status. What is also very interesting is the names of places in most of Scottish and Indian charters have survived almost a millennium later. For instance, a copperplate inscription of the 6th century talks of a village Shalmalivataka in the Bardhaman region of Bengal. Interestingly, the village still survives as Mallasarul, the fine-spot of the inscription along with its neighbouring settlements. Prof. Sanyal said there are numerous such places surviving in the countryside of Bengal.

Post this publication, historians from both the countries are keen on taking the work further by excavating some of the sites prominently named in Bengal and Scottish charters to study the nature of rural settlements in early medieval period.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/h7bpx/article30770738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mallasarul-Obv-1-1-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/fascinating-similarities-between-early-medieval-indian-copper-plates-and-scottish-charters/article30770740.ece
227,2020/02/09,One dead as three-storey building collapses in Punjab,"One person died while three were rescued from the debris of a three-storey building that collapsed on Saturday in Kharar town of Mohali district in Punjab, the police said.

“Construction work was being carried out near the three-storey building. The building reportedly came down when a JCB machine was digging an adjacent plot for construction of basement,” said Senior Superintendent of Police, Mohali, Kuldeep Singh Chahal.

Officials said efforts are on to find out if more people are trapped under the debris.

228,2020/02/09,Crusader to revive agitation after knee surgery,"Veteran 94-year-old socialist leader and former parliamentarian Pandit Ramkishan on Saturday announced the revival of his agitation, of bringing water to 13 districts in eastern Rajasthan, after getting his mobility restored through a robotic knee surgery, rare for a person of his age. Mr. Ramkishan had delayed the surgery for 14 years to continue his campaign.

Though the former Lok Sabha member’s 10-year-long agitation had led to the approval of the Eastern Rajasthan Canal Project (ERCP), stipulating the transfer of excess water from the Chambal river basin to 13 districts facing water scarcity, the State government is still trying hard to get the national project status for it. The mega project is to be implemented with an expenditure of ₹37,247 crore.

An enthusiast even at this age, Mr. Ramkishan said that he would continue fighting till water reaches “each agricultural farm”. He was once elected to the Lok Sabha in 1977 and four times to the Rajasthan Assembly in 1962, 1967, 1974 and 1990.

He underwent left knee surgery on January 8. He has been continuing with physiotherapy, exercise and walking since then. As he now walks for an hour everyday with the help of a stick, the robotic surgery on his second knee will be performed next month after the gap required to rehabilitate a patient at this age.

Orthopaedic surgeon Anoop Jhurani, who conducted the operation, said Mr. Ramkishan could be the oldest male patient in the country to have undergone the robotic knee surgery.

Firm resolve

“Though his age was a question, but his organs were functioning normally. More than his organ strength, it was his resolve to continue to work for the cause which has restored his mobility,” he said.

In his heydays, Mr. Ramkishan, hailing from Bharatpur district, led several agitations since Quit India Movement in 1942. He was the Socialist Party president since 1958 and he headed the State unit of Samajwadi Party till a couple of years ago, when he quit politics.

Mr. Ramkishan has been associated with all Chief Ministers of Rajasthan since Independence. He gave shelter to former Nepal Prime Minister B.P. Koirala, in Rajasthan when the latter was fighting the King in-exile.

The nonagenarian leader said his mobility would empower him to keep fighting for dignity of the deprived and the poor “as per the socialist ideals”. “Now that the canal project has been approved, this interval created by the surgery has strengthened me to take up the fight for getting water for thirsty people and parched land,” he said.

PM Narendra Modi had promised to declare the ERCP a national project during his rallies before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The Congress government here has reminded Mr. Modi of his promise several times, while pointing out that the national project status would facilitate solution to the water scarcity issue in eastern and southeastern districts of the State at least till 2051.

The project, linking Parvati, Kali Sindh and Chambal rivers, is expected to benefit 40% of the State’s population with the supply of drinking water to 13 districts and irrigation waters to an additional command area of 2 lakh hectares. It will also facilitate restoration of dependable yield of the existing 26 major and medium irrigation projects en route — reduced to 30% — to their original status.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/31j74e/article30773290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08PRIYAPANDITRAMKISHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/crusader-to-revive-agitation-after-knee-surgery/article30773291.ece
229,2020/02/09,NPF seeks anti-CAA resolution,"Nagaland Assembly on Saturday witnessed noisy scenes, as the Opposition, the Naga People’s Front, protested against the amended Citizenship Act, and insisted that an anti-CAA resolution be passed in the House, taking a cue from States such as Kerala and West Bengal.

Rejecting the NPF demand, Deputy Chief Minister Y. Patton said the law would not affect the Nagas, as the States with Inner Line Permit regime have been exempted from its purview.

Opposition leader T.R. Zeliang, NPF MLAs Chotisuh Sazo and Chumben Murry, during a discussion on matters of public importance said that the ILP would not impede influx of illegal immigrants.

Opposition sceptical

Mr. Zeliang said Assam had not been entirely exempted from the purview of the law, making Nagaland, with its porous borders, susceptible to illegal infiltration.

“Let us study the case and find out if the Centre is truly planning to accord citizenship to the persecuted. If that is the case, why only three countries — Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan — have been included in the law? Why not people from Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, Bhutan and the Buddhists from Tibet? Does this Act truly stand for what the Central government claims, or is it a law to garner votes?” he said.

230,2020/02/09,TISS teachers condemn sedition case against student,"The Tata Institute of Social Sciences Teachers Association (TISSTA) has condemned the filing of a sedition case against Urvashi Chudawala, who identifies as Kris Chudawala, stating that the case has been registered on “flimsy grounds”. It said the TISS student was being made a scapegoat to undermine the institution.

“The scapegoating of TISS students participating in peaceful protests and whose actions had been taken completely out of context and twisted to suit a predetermined agenda, is part of a larger attempt to undermine an academic institution that stands for Constitutional values and social justice,” the statement said.

It also condemned the use of the sedition law as a political tool to suppress peaceful protests, saying the law was “outdated” and “colonial” and its use neither justifiable nor legally tenable.

The association also criticised sections of the media for its portrayal of the issue, calling it a trial by media. “Kris has been maliciously projected as a traitor to the nation, firstly by politically motivated individuals on social media, and then amplified by some sections of the mainstream media; we condemn this vicious trial by media, that seeks to destroy the reputation and future prospects of our student.”

According to TISSTA, revealing the name of the young trans student amounted to harassment and was “tantamount to a hate crime.” The student, who was the only one named in the FIR for allegedly raising slogans in favour of Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam, has approached the Bombay High Court seeking anticipatory bail after the sessions court rejected it on February 5.

The teachers’ association also highlighted that the institute had been serving the nation since Independence by providing skilled professionals in the social sector and contributing to the programmes and policies of the government. It said the institute’s contribution was being “systematically devalued by projecting it as a space that promotes activities that undermine the nation.”

“Nothing could be further from the truth and TISSTA expresses concern and condemnation of recent attempts by politically vested interests to defame an institution of excellence that has contributed to the well-being of the nation for 84 years,” the statement said.

Senior BJP leader Kirit Somaiya had recently said that a group of students from the institute were “radical leftists” and “urban naxals” and had been participating in protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tiss-teachers-condemn-sedition-case-against-student/article30773105.ece

232,2020/02/09,Police start issuing notices to protesters at Mumbai Bagh,"A day after an FIR was registered against the Mumbai Bagh protesters, the Nagpada police on Saturday started issuing notices to them under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Many called this a pressure tactic by the police, saying they were deliberately trying to discourage participation by doing so.

Late on Friday, the police had booked the 300-odd women, who have been protesting on Morland Road since January 26, for allegedly obstructing the road’s concretisation. The FIR was registered on complaint of assistant municipal commissioner Alka Sasane with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

Feroz Mithiborewala, one of the organisers, said around 10 a.m., some police officials were distributing notices under Section 149 of the CrPC, which informs people that in case their actions lead to a law and order issue, they stand liable to face a criminal case.

According to Mr. Mithiborewala, the police barricades at the site were moved to restrict the space occupied by the protesting women on Saturday. He added that irrespective of any pressure tactics, the protest would not be quelled.

“The BMC’s complaint is a pressure tactic. The police obviously can not take us out by force. That is not a good picture to present because we are a democracy. You can issue me a notice at my house but the police can not disturb the women here. We are in dialogue with the Mumbai Police and the State government, but our problem is with the Centre,” Mr. Mithiborewala said.

He also said, “There are several other roads in the city which have potholes and need to be repaired but the BMC has to give attention to only this one. This road was previously blocked for several months, hampering transport, but now is the time they choose to work on it.”

Saba Shaikh, a protester, said the notices were in Marathi and many women had a problem understanding their content. Mehar Ansari said any relative or volunteer who brought food or other refreshments for the protesters had to first register their personal information with the police.

“The issuing of the notices has instilled a fear among those who were distributing food and water, which is only human. We haven’t had the usual influx of lunch packages today, and are making do with biscuits and glucose water,” said Shaheen Khan, another protester.

Retired Assistant Commissioner of Police Shamsher Khan Pathan, who now has his own political party called Awami Vikas Manch, was seen at the protest. “I came here on Friday after the political parties backed out. I am here to help the women in anyway possible. I have issued many such notices in my tenure. It is not something to be afraid of. It is only preventive measure.”

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone III) Abhinash Kumar said the notices were being issued as a message to desist from joining the protest, as it was an illegal one. “The road belongs to the BMC, and its officials complained that the construction work is lagging due to the protest. The law does not oppose protest but the protesters have to first seek permission,” he said.

Curiously, despite the Nationalist Congress Party withdrawing their support to the protest, party leader Vidya Chavan was seen there.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ukl48/article30773064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BMMUMBAIBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/police-start-issuing-notices-to-protesters-at-mumbai-bagh/article30773065.ece
233,2020/02/09,Enforce use of Marathi in all govt. offices in State: Desai,"Reiterating the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government’s commitment to promoting local language, Marathi Language Minister Subhash Desai has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah demanding the effective implementation of tri-language formula in Maharashtra.

As part of the formula, Marathi should be made mandatory in offices, banks, railways and post offices within the State.

The formula was introduced as part of the National Policy on Education, 1968, which made it mandatory for students in non-Hindi speaking States to learn Hindi. It is commonly understood that the other two languages referred to are English and the regional language of the State.

“Marathi is the official language of the State as per Maharashtra Official Language Act, 1964. The Central government has adopted the policy of the Official Language Rules, 1976, by which the tri-language formula is applied to all the offices of the State authority. But Central government authorities do not adhere to the tri-language formula,” the Shiv Sena minister said in his letter.

The letter also said since there was no provision for penalties or disciplinary action in the tri-language norms, the concerned departments should be promptly notified about the use of Marathi language.

“Our government has received many complaints of the absence of Marathi language in many Central government offices, nationalised banks, and the Western and Central Railways. It has been noticed that the concerned offices are not compliant despite repeated instructions. I request you to compel these offices to follow the norm,” Mr. Desai’s letter said.

Earlier, the Minister had said his government will enact a law during the next Assembly session in February, making it mandatory to teach Marathi in all schools in the State, irrespective of their medium of instructions. He said the government intends to carry out all its business in Marathi and added files without notings in the State language will not be accepted.

“The government will frame a law in next month’s Assembly session, making it mandatory to teach Marathi language from Class I to Class X in all schools irrespective of the mode of instruction,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lx194v/article30772980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9BMSUBHASHDESAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/enforce-use-of-marathi-in-all-govt-offices-in-state-desai/article30772981.ece
234,2020/02/09,Aurangabad therapist makes Ironman triathlon history,"Niket Dalal, a 38-year-old from Aurangabad, created history on February 7 by becoming the first completely visually-challenged athlete to finish an Ironman triathlon.

Associated with Adventures Beyond Barriers Foundation (ABBF), Mr. Dalal completed the gruelling Ironman 70.3 — consisting of a 1.9 km swim, a 90 km bicycle ride and a 21.1 km run — with assistance from his sighted companion, Arham Shaikh.

Mr. Shaikh is the youngest Indian to finish the 5000 km coast-to-coast cross-country race in the U.S.

“The first Indian achieved an Ironman finish in 2005. Till 2020, we had no disabled athlete to have completed the race. I believe if we have to work towards complete inclusivity, this huge gap of 15 years needs to be bridged and this is one of the major reasons why I did this,” Mr. Dalal said.

Mr. Dalal and Mr. Shaikh completed the race in seven hours and 44 minutes, with 46 mins to spare. They stood second in their category of physically disabled athletes, and were the first Indian team to finish a Ironman 70.3 triathlon.

Mr. Dalal, a professional speech therapist, participated as part of a team from the Pune-based PowerPeaks Athlete Lab, which is founded by coach and pro-athlete Chaitanya Velhal. Mr. Velhal has been racing as well as training participants for triathlons, cycling races and marathons for the last five years.

Rigorous training

“It took a lot of detailed training, endurance and fitness assessments and diet planning to bring Niket up to the training required. The first leg of the race required Niket and Arham to complete the entire swim course while being tethered together. Swimming together for 1.9 km in the open sea with hundreds of other athletes, while trying to keep to the course was extremely challenging,” Mr. Velhal said.

“This was followed by a quick transition to the 90 km bike ride, where the riders faced heavy winds and dehydration but there were special aid stations set up. The most exhausting segment was the 21.1 km run. The temperatures were soaring and the landscape was difficult, but they conquered with strength and flair,” the coach said.

Mr. Shaikh added, “Both of us trained hard under Mr. Velhal for the last four months, continuously refining and improving upon our skill-set for the huge task facing us.”

Always having had a passion for sports, Mr. Dalal has been a State-level swimmer and has participated in and won many sea swimming competitions. He took up cycling as a sport last year and completed the grueling Manali to Khardungala cycling expedition in August 2019.",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/6tp640/article30773123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09BM-Niket-Dalal,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/aurangabad-therapist-makes-ironman-triathlon-history/article30773124.ece

242,2020/02/09,"Tribunal raps Corporation, asks it to clear dues to waste management contractor","The Coimbatore Corporation Commissioner should give serious thoughts on what would happen to the city if shortage of funds curtailed the operations of the waste management contractor. Therefore, he should immediately pay the contractor, the Arbitral Tribunal said while hearing a dispute between the Corporation and the contractor.

The Tribunal was hearing the dispute after the Madras High Court referred to it the case the contractor, Coimbatore Integrated Waste Management Co. Pvt. Ltd., had filed against the Corporation for failing to pay.

Before the Tribunal headed by Presiding Arbitrator Justice (retd.) Doraiswamy Raju, the contractor had on November 14, 2019 filed an application complaining that the Corporation had not complied with the earlier order dated May 3, 2019 by failing to clear dues amounting to ₹ 21 crore.

The Corporation had paid only ₹ 14.10 crore and that too in instalments.

In its defence, the Corporation had submitted that the challenge it faced in paying the contractor had to with its financial difficulties and nothing else.

Consequent upon the submission, the Tribunal had ordered the Corporation to pay ₹ 5 crore by December 31, 2019 saying, “It needs no serious effort to point out that if the day to day activities of the Claimant [the contractor] suffer in any manner and comes to a stand still, the entire municipal area will run into serious difficulties and problems including health hazards and outbreak of diseases besides seriously endangering ecological impact in the area. We are of the considered view that the Commissioner, a senior officer of the Indian Administrative Cadre, would bestow his serious thoughts over all such calamities that may result if there has been no proper compliance with our orders in the matter of remittance of the arrears and subsequent monthly remuneration.”

The Tribunal did not stop there, though. It went to warn the Corporation saying, “If there is any failure to comply with the order passed today [December 11, 2019] the Respondent [Corporation] is put on notice that we may be constrained to commend the disobedience of the orders passed to the notice of the High Court for appropriate action for contempt...”

Sources familiar with the developments said after the Corporation paid only ₹ 3.50 crore of the ₹ 5 crore the Tribunal had ordered, taking the total dues to around ₹ 9.40 crore. This was besides the ₹ 40 crore that the Corporation owed the contractor.

Inspection

As a part of this order, the Tribunal had ordered an inspection of the contractor’s facility in Vellalore by solid waste management expert N.B. Mazumdar. It said that Mr. Mazumdar should “visit the project in question...assess the civil, mechanical and other operational conditions of the project including any environmental impact and submit report within six weeks i.e. on or before 25.01.2020.” The sources said that Mr. Mazumdar had visited the facility but would submit his report in a week’s time. Thereafter, the Tribunal would pass further orders. The Tribunal ordered the inspection based on an application by the Corporation, which had insisted on such an exercise to study the contractor’s waste management operation.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/icukmr/article30772633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB09WASTEMANAGEMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tribunal-raps-corporation-asks-it-to-clear-dues-to-waste-management-contractor/article30772634.ece

247,2020/02/09,England beats South Africa in final ODI,"England beat South Africa by two wickets in the third and final ODI at the Wanderers Stadium on Sunday.

England leg-spinner Adil Rashid took three wickets in his 100th ODI as South Africa was restricted to 256 for seven.

Rashid’s wickets included that of Temba Bavuma and South Africa captain Quinton de Kock, who made 69.

The visitors’ chase was orchestrated by Jonny Bairstow (43), Joe Root (49) and Joe Denly 66.

It was tough going for South Africa, although David Miller lifted the hosts’ hopes with some powerful hitting while remaining unbeaten on 69 off 53 balls, dominating an unbeaten eighth-wicket stand of 52 off 32 balls at the end of the innings. Miller smashed four sixes and four fours.

England’s opening bowlers Tom Curran and new cap Saqib Mahmood gained early movement off a pitch which had been under cover all day on Saturday because of heavy rain, while the spinners got some turn.

Slow bowlers seldom feature at the Wanderers, with its short boundaries, but spin accounted for 27 overs, including 17 in tandem between Rashid and off-spinner Moeen Ali, with the latter returning to action for the first time since June.

Moeen bowled Rassie van der Dussen who, in the previous over, had been given out leg-before first ball to Rashid, immediately after Bavuma had seemingly wasted a review, also after being given out lbw.

But because the Ultra Edge technology had failed, van der Dussen was able to seek a review which showed the ball was missing leg-stump. The batsman made only five before he was out.

South Africa won the opening match before the second one was rained off.

The scores: South Africa 256/7 in 50 overs (Quinton de Kock 69, David Miller 69 n.o., Adil Rashid 3/51) lost to England 257/8 in 43.2 overs (Jonny Bairstow 43, Joe Root 49, Joe Denly 66, Lungi Ngidi 3/63, Beuran Hendricks 3/59).

Once play resumed after rain, target was revised to 170 and with seven runs to get and three wickets in hand, it became a cakewalk for the ‘Tiger Cubs’ as they scripted a golden chapter in their country’s cricket history.

India’s cricketing battles with Bangladesh have been filled with acrimony since 2015 World Cup quarter-final at the MCG and it had only amplified with the kind of boorish behaviour that some of the Bangladeshi players displayed.

On Sunday also, a few players from both sides nearly came to blows at the end of the game and it was India coach Paras Mhambrey, who was seen urging his boys to keep calm as opposition leading pacer Shoriful Islam was seen swearing expletives on camera.

Even then, credit should go Bangladesh’s 18-year-old captain Akbar Ali, who showed nerves of steel with a patient 43 not out off 77 balls, which negated more fancied opponent Yashasvi Jaiswal’s 88 off 121 balls.

Akbar’s cool quotient was there for everyone to see as he marshalled his resources brilliantly and then batted responsibly, seeing out India’s threats from leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi and fast bowler Kartik Tyagi’s spells before reaching the finishing line with ease.

There were two things that cost India dearly. While batting, India lost their last seven wickets for 23 runs. And then while defending, the number of extras (33) bowled did matter in the final context of the game.

Bangladesh’s chase started in earnest with Parvez Hossain Emon (47 off 79 balls) and Tanzid Hasan (17) adding 50 in quick time, primarily due to former’s impressive off-side play.

However, things changed once leg-spinner Bishnoi (4/30 in 10 overs) came into the attack and started bowling his googlies.

First he got Tanzid holed out in the deep and then had Mahmudul Hassan Joy (8) played on with another wrong ‘un and Towhid Hridoy was also rapped on the pads and Dhruv Jurel effected a smart stumping to make it 65 for 4.

With Emon back in the hut due to hamstring injury, it was on skipper Akbar to show composure in the hour of crisis even as left-arm seamer Sushant Singh in his second and third spell got a couple of wickets.

Then, it was Emon who again came back at 102 for 6 as Akbar finally got hold of Bishnoi’s googlies as there was one slog sweep for six. With Bishnoi not having an effective leg-break, he was taken out of the attack.

Emon, despite hamstring issues, fought gamely before Jaiswal bowled his part-time leg-breaks and Garg’s gamble paid off with the opener being caught in the extra cover region to make it 143 for 7.

Earlier, India’s batting wilted under pressure as a superb Bangladesh bowling attack shot the defending champions out for a paltry 177 in 47.2 overs.

Jaiswal (88 off 121 balls) was once again a standout performer but not for once did he look like dominating the Bangladesh bowling unit whose new ball bowlers Shoriful Islam (2/31 in 10 overs) and Tanzim Hasan Shakib (2/28 in 8.2 overs) literally stifled the Indians for runs.

The third seamer Avishek Das (3/40 in 9 overs) was the most successful bowler in terms of figures but it was Shoriful’s first spell with channelised aggression that put the Indians on the back-foot from the onset.

Only 23 came off the first 10 overs and India never recovered from the slow start despite a sedate 93-run stand between Jaiswal and NT Tilak Verma (38 off 65 balls) in 23.2 overs.

Shoriful and Shakib were not afraid of sledging the Indian batsmen as they bowled full and got the ball to swing away from the left-handers. The fielding was also agile and top-notched, making it difficult throughout the Indian innings.

Once Jaiswal was out, the distinct lack of match-time for other Indian batsmen was evident as seven wickets fell for only 23 runs.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/alcaic/article30777530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BangladeshU19team,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-under-19-world-cup-final-india-under-19-vs-bangladesh-under-19-at-potchefstroom/article30775966.ece

Opening the batting along side skipper Hanuma Vihari (59), Gill scored his runs off 153 balls with the help of 13 boundaries and one six to help India A pile up 234/1 in 53 overs.

Middle-order mainstay Cheteshwar Pujara was giving Gill company at the crease on 52 off 99 balls at the draw of stumps.

Earlier, New Zealand declared their innings at 386 for nine in 131.5 overs after the second day’s play was washed out on Saturday.

251,2020/02/09,Watch | Those five minutes: When Sachin Tendulkar faced six deliveries,"Never was an innings break so anticipated in a game of cricket.

It lasted for five-odd minutes but for Sachin Tendulkar devotees, even that was good enough time if their ‘God’ is out there on the 22 yards in a country where he is revered no less than his own.

And those five minutes of just putting bat to ball for raising funds for Bushfire charity will be archived with much care as much as his hundred international hundreds.

With a dodgy shoulder, Tendulkar didn’t take part in the charity game but was played an over from Australia’s superstar woman cricketer Ellyse Perry during the break. Perry had challenged Tendulkar to face her for an over in a video message on social media which the Indian legend had accepted.

Used to seeing him either in spotless whites or the light blue (once navy blue) India colours, the fans at the Junction Oval ground in Melbourne must have been chuffed watching him come out in Australian yellow.

The helmet was yellow, the pads weren’t ultra-light and the bat sported the kookaburra logo instead of MRF or Adidas but who cared for those five minutes.

The first delivery by Perry was tucked off his hips and the fielder at short fine-leg let it go much to her embarrassment and the crowd was happy. He repeated the shot towards deep square leg and got a couple.

“It’s an incredible feeling to bowl to Tendulkar and watch Brian Lara bat,” said Australia’s double international Perry, who would play a key role in tri-series final against India. Perry has also represented Australia in football.

A couple of deliveries were bowled by another Australian youngster Annabel Sutherland, daughter of CA chief executive James. But the 46-year-old Tendulkar charitably pushed it towards the fielders, in full spirit with the essence of ‘Charity Game’

Fans wouldn’t have mind a booming cover drive but even the lazy pat to the fielder was vociferously acknowledged.

252,2020/02/09,Brian Lara shines as cricket legends raise money for Australian bushfire relief,"Brian Lara showed he still has what it takes with a stylish 30 not out as cricketing royalty helped raise money to aid Australian bushfire relief in a charity match on Sunday.

The West Indian legend stroked a series of lofted cover drives and straight drives, including two sixes, before retiring to give another batsman a chance in a star-studded Bushfire Bash at Melbourne's Junction Oval.

His captain Ricky Ponting, coming in after Justin Langer was out, also hit 26 as his team made 104 for five from their 10 overs.

Adam Gilchrist smacked a six off the first ball in the run chase before being knocked over, then Shane Watson slammed 30 from nine balls, with Wasim Akram being punished.

But despite a valiant effort from the Gilchrist XI, Ponting's side won by one run.

“All the players have had a ball. They are all saying why couldn't we play more,” said Ponting. “Well done to everyone involved. Sharing a dressing room with guys I spent 25 years with.”

After the game, Cricket Australia tweeted that “thanks to the incredible generosity from Australia and around the globe, we've raised over Aus$7.7 million to support communities and families impacted by the recent bushfires”.

Fundraising has been ongoing since the blazes began in September.

253,2020/02/09,Nepal’s 15-year-old Kaushal Malla youngest to hit ODI 50,"Nepal teenager Kushal Malla has become the youngest batsman to score a One-Day International (ODI) half-century in men’s cricket.

The left-handed Malla made 50 off 51 balls on his ODI debut in a World Cup League 2 match against the U.S. near Kathmandu on February 8 aged 15 years and 340 days.

He broke the record held by his compatriot Rohit Kumar Paudel, who was 16 years and 146 days old when he scored 55 in an ODI against the UAE last year.

Malla, who has played three Twenty20 matches for Nepal, came in to bat when his team was struggling at 49 for five. He guided them to 190 and a 35-run win.

India’s cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar was 16 years and 214 days when he made a half-century in a Test against Pakistan in Faisalabad in 1989.

Nepal gained ODI status at the 2018 World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe, despite the suspension of their national governing body in 2016 over political interference.

254,2020/02/09,Southee behaved like a true leader in 2nd ODI: Hamish Bennett,"New Zealand pacer Hamish Bennett says Tim Southee showed exemplary leadership qualities when he played through pain and discomfort during the second ODI against India.

New Zealand were almost rendered a bowler short as Southee was hit by a stomach bug and bowled through the pain to get his side across the line.

He picked 2-41 as New Zealand won the second ODI by 22 runs on Saturday, taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three match series.

“For him to do that, it just shows how much wearing the silver fern on his chest means to him. He’s a good leader in our side and his actions have a lot to do with that and last night we saw that. He led by example, to show that no matter what the situation is, you’ve just got to go out there and get the job done,” said Bennett.

“As New Zealanders, that’s what we pride ourselves on, getting the job done, whether we’re fit or not fit. It was a pretty brave effort.”

Bennett said they were confident to defend the 270-run total despite Eden Park being a small ground.

“Eden Park is a funny ground, it is small boundary-wise and scores here haven’t been too high, as people would like to believe. It is not an easy ground to bat in the ODIs. We knew if we get early wickets we could put pressure on their batting order. They have a couple key players, and once we got them early, you can put pressure on any batting group doing that. Last night we were fortunate that our plans came off,” said Bennett.

It was a debut to remember for pacer Kyle Jamieson. Playing on his home ground, he put up a valuable partnership with Ross Taylor to propel the score. Then, he took two wickets to rock the Indian line-up and steered his side to victory.

Bennett said India got too close at the end for comfort, but they managed to sneak through with the win.

“Kyle and I have played together in Auckland. We have trained together and I remember when we were at Lincoln University nets. He bowled to Tom Latham and almost hit him on the throat. He is tall, gets that bounce and was quick as well. I have always felt there will be a time for Kyle.

“Being big means he would have some problems physically, but he has got over them, and now has a bright future ahead of him, no doubt,” said Bennett.

India are now staring down the barrel at a series’ whitewash. New Zealand have the chance to make it 3-0 in reply to the 5-0 loss they had suffered in the preceding T20I series.

“Our young bowling unit has done pretty well. Energy is high in the group and we want to secure as much as we can and enjoy this challenge. We have done it well in the last two matches, although we weren’t far off in the T20s either just needed a bit of luck. Fortunately through the ODI series, luck has been on our side.

“It has been a great challenge against India. They are a world-class side and have played some great cricket on this tour. I have loved every over I have bowled in this series. I have enjoyed playing out there for my country. Humbled to do that even if it is a cliche,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/70lgpw/article30775078.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TIM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/southee-behaved-like-a-true-leader-in-2nd-odi-hamish-bennett/article30775079.ece

The centenarian, who was escorted by her son, daughter-in-law and grandson, said she had never missed an opportunity to vote since the time she got her voter-ID.

Her son Sukhranwan Mandal said they are refugees from Bangladesh, who initially stayed in a camp and then were transferred to Chhattisgarh before finally coming to Delhi.

Mr. Mandal said he was a child when he came to the city hence does not remember when the family moved to Delhi. “I believe it was around 1970, I am not sure,” he said, adding that his mother was born in undivided India in 1908 and has seen the partition of India and Pakistan and then of Bangladesh and Pakistan.

“I take care of her. She does not have any particular health issues,” said Mr. Mandal.

Assistant Returning Officer Harish Kumar, who went to Ms. Mandal’s house to provide her pick-and-drop facility, said: “This time, we have extended the pick-and-drop facility to all voters above 80 years of age.”

“There was a centralised call centre — 1950, where people called to book the facility.

256,2020/02/09,North East Delhi again registers highest voter turnout,"Similar to voter turnout trends in the previous Assembly elections, New Delhi district saw the lowest overall turnout at 57.11% while the North East Delhi district saw the highest overall turnout at 67.83%, as of 12.00 midnight on Saturday.

Polling started at a sluggish pace and the voting percentage was low till noon.

However, it picked up pace as the day grew warmer.

With voter turnout data pouring in till late in the night, the Delhi Chief Electoral Officer refused to comment on the reasons behind the comparatively low turnout of 61.71%. The overall turnout in 2015 was 67.13%.

Multiple factors affect voter turnout, including the fact that polling was held on a weekend, said the CEO. The voting percentage was 60.6 in the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

At midnight, the Election Commission’s voter turnout app reported that the Delhi Cantonment Assembly constituency in the New Delhi district reported the lowest turnout at 45.42%. In 2015, the constituency had reported the lowest turnout of 58.49%.

Seelampur, in the North East Delhi district, reported the highest turnout at 71.40%. In 2015, the constituency had reported a turnout of 71.51%. The highest turnout in the last Assembly elections was reported in Gokalpur, a reserved constituency in the North East district, at 73.46%.

Though long queues were witnessed at polling stations in the Okhla constituency, the EC’s app reported only 58.83% turnout.

Election officials, however, said that there was a lag in turnout data being reported in the app. A review of the 2015 voter tournout data, however, showed that the Okhla constituency had the second lowest voter turnout at 60.73% in the previous Assembly elections.

Till late night

Voting at about 103 stations went on till late into the night even though the gates of polling stations were closed at 6 p.m. Voters who had queued up before the deadline were issued tokens to ensure that they cast their vote. While the voter turnout figures are likely to increase, the final figure is unlikely to surpass the record 67.13% voter turnout witnessed in 2015.

North West district saw 62.23% turnout, South 59.65%, Central 58.57%, South West 61.57%, East 61.29%, West 61.79%, North 57.19%, Shahadra 62.96%, and South East 54.89%.

257,2020/02/09,"Leaders of BJP, AAP in a fix in two-cornered contest","With their collective fate sealed in the confines of Electronic Voting Machines, each of the three political players in the Capital went into a huddle here on Saturday evening.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah summoned the BJP’s seven MPs to assess the party’s performance at its State headquarters while Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal presided over a similar meeting with AAP bigwigs in the party’s electoral “war room”.

This election witnessed relatively low voter turnout compared to the previous three elections, said insiders, adding that the 2020 polls were not only bereft of “a wave” but was mainly a two-cornered battle between AAP and the BJP,with the Congress mostly missing in action.

“This seems to have been a peculiar election as there was no significant undercurrent either in support of AAP or the BJP, which is one way to perceive the low voting percentage. We were expecting a more comfortable win on the back of Mr. Kejriwal’s wave like in 2015,” said an AAP insider, adding that their party needs to focus on “better booth management” in the future.

A source in the BJP said: “We are confident of getting 38 seats and forming the government. The low voter turnout seems to indicate a wave in favour of the BJP, which was evident during the Lok Sabha election that we contested on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s face, who was not there on the ground today. This was a local election and anything above the figure of three seats is a win for us.”

The 2015 Assembly elections had registered a voter turnout of 67.13%, 2013 recorded 65.93% and in 2008, it was 57%.

On local, national issues

The citizens said they voted on the basis of both national and local issues. The turnout for the 2020 elections, as of 12 a.m. on Saturday, was 61.71%.

Husband and wife Kamal and Revti Gautam from Chandni Chowk said they do not know the name of AAP’s candidate from their constituency but voted for Mr. Kejriwal. “We voted for [PM] Modi in the last election and now we are voting for Kejriwal. We are impressed with Modi’s international policies and Kejriwal’s local policies,” they said.

Kamal said he was happy with the work done by AAP in hospitals and school.

“I was able to get my child admitted to a school, which is a big thing today,” he said.

Sahil, a first-time voter from Civil Lines Assembly constituency, said: “I believe in Modi but have voted for Kejriwal because he is popular.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/leaders-of-bjp-aap-in-a-fix-in-two-cornered-contest/article30773329.ece

The model polling stations had several facilities such as toilets, drinking water, shade, ramps and wheelchairs. The stations were set up inside maintained buildings with freshly painted walls, and quality furniture for polling personnel. The voters appreciated the efforts of the EC personnel, especially the arrangement made for senior citizens and the differently abled. Urmila Devi from west Ansari Nagar said: “The arrangements for voters here at the Atal Adarsh Vidyalaya, Havlock Square, are commendable. But this is also because of the facelift that the school received because of the Delhi government.”

Shalu Devi, a voter from Civil Lines, said: “Everyone deployed to assist voters have been very helpful... from information about the booths to queries related to water and assisting senior citizens. The authorities have done a good job.” A model polling station in Green Park had a red carpet laid out for voters from the gate to the polling booth. The station had a first-aid booth and huge waiting areas with chairs. Most of these model polling stations also had women officials. In a model polling station in Chilla village, officials put up selfie booths, had large waiting areas, and even made arrangements to engage children.

260,2020/02/09,Rohini murder accused left five jobs to join Delhi Police: father,"A Delhi police Sub-Inspector and an accused in the murder case of his colleague, Sub-Inspector Preeti Ahlawat, had left five government jobs earlier to join the police force two years ago, his father revealed.

The officer who was found dead in his car in Sonipat soon after he killed his colleague late on Friday, also planned to quit his present job in a few months since he had been selected as a tax assistant in the Income-Tax Department.

His father, a former policeman in the Haryana Police, told The Hindu over phone that his son had planned to quit his job in another six months and was expecting an appointment letter from the Income-Tax Department in July.

“He was a bright student and was earlier selected as a station master. He also landed jobs in the Supreme Court, post office and the DRDO. But he did not join. He worked at the CAG office in Chandigarh for 15 days before he took up the job of a Sub-Inspector in the Delhi Police. He was posted in Chandigarh in CAG office when we asked him to join Delhi Police so that he could stay closer to home,” the father, who is a resident of Shastri Nagar in Sonipat, said. The 60-year-old had retired as a Sub-Inspector in April 2018.

The accused, a mechanical engineer, was the younger of two siblings in the family and had joined the Delhi Police on March 22, 2018. He was posted at Bhajanpura police station and used to visit his parents in Sonipat during weekends.

His father said it was a usual day for his son on Friday as he got his car serviced and also bought a new pair of shoes for himself.

Looking for match

“We were scheduled to visit a family to look for a match for him on Saturday. But destiny had some other plans. We are shattered and left with no support at this age,” the father added.

He said he received a call from the HSIIDC Barhi police station at 2 a.m on Saturday and was told that a car registered under his name was found on the Delhi-Chandigarh highway and there was a man’s body lying inside. The father said he reached the spot to find his son dead in the car. “The car was locked from inside and the headlights were on. I opened it with duplicate keys that I had carried along,” said the retired police officer. He said that his son had never told the family about Preeti.

Vinay Kumar, SHO, HSIIDC Barhi police station, said that they were informed by the Delhi police about the incident. He ruled out any foul play in the death of the policeman confirming that he had shot himself.

The last rites of the deceased were performed at his village Lakhan Majra in Rohtak.

261,2020/02/09,Shaheen Bagh votes to end ‘communal talk’,"Shaheen Bagh, which has been the nucleus of anti-CAA protests in the city for over 50 days, saw people come out in large numbers to vote for an “end to communal talk”, on Saturday in the Delhi Assembly elections. The voters in the area, which falls under the Okhla Assembly Constituency, went to the polling stations in batches to ensure that the protest remained undisturbed.

Most hoped for safer educational spaces.

Heena Ahmad, a make-up artist, who was standing in a queue to cast her vote after spending the night at the protest site, said: “For the last 56 days, we have been protesting for a safer future for our children. Good education and safer environment in educational institutions is the need of the hour. My daughter was injured in the December 15 incident [at Jamia Millia Islamia]. We also do not want Ministers who use impolite language.”

A 27-year-old homemaker, Nazneen Banu, said: “The Prime Minister, at one point, used to talk about ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’. But now, look how he is treating women. To him, clearing roads is more important than addressing our demands. How are we supposed to trust him?”

“What we need is good healthcare and education for our children. For us, saving ₹100 a day means that the children will get an extra dish in their meals,” the mother of four added.

Stating that her vote was towards “development”, Praveen Khan, a nurse at a hospital in Karol Bagh, said: “In the last five years, we have got free electricity and free bus rides. For poor people like us, nothing else matters. Saving on bus fare means a lot to us, then why should we not support the government which has actually worked for us?”

Voters near Jamia Millia Islamia, another area that has been pivotal to the ongoing protests against the amended citizenship law, said: “It was a clear choice”. Homemaker Feiman Fatma said: “My vote was for a better education system. I am sure that the protest against the CAA will be an important factor in this election.”

Businessman Rais Ahmad, who also voted from Shaheen Bagh, said: “This election is based on development. We have already seen what ‘vikas’ is happening in the country.”

Space crunch

Meanwhile, people at Okhla Modern Public School, one of the polling stations in Shaheen Bagh, complained that only three polling booths were provided for 4,400 voters.

The security personnel in and around the school had a tough time managing the queue as people had to wait for hours before they could cast their votes. When the voters complained about the situation, a polling officer said: “Nothing can be done now.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rm0qb9/article30773172.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/9DESHAHEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shaheen-bagh-votes-to-end-communal-talk/article30773173.ece

266,2020/02/09,Delhi 2020: The buzz in AAP's central ‘war room’,"It is 3.30 p.m. on Saturday and everyone inside the main room of 16 E, Ferozshah Road, is on edge. The voter turnout is less than expected.

Leaders inside room

At least four men, smartphones in their hands, are giving updates to AAP Delhi election in-charge Sanjay Singh and Prashant Kishor of I-PAC.

Mr. Kishor was roped in by the Aam Aadmi Party for the election campaign.

The bungalow, which has been allotted to an AAP MP, has doubled as the central “war room” for the party throughout the day.

“Why is the turnout low in GK1 and GK2? The rich are not coming out to vote?” one person asked an AAP volunteer over the phone.

Another person walked into the room to show on his phone that the turnout had touched 40%.

“Don’t worry about the turnout, it will touch 60% for sure,” another man assured the rest of the room.

One room in each Assembly

The party had set up 70 “war rooms” — one each for the 70 Assembly constituencies — for management of poll activities. The party had also deployed two “booth-level agents” per election booth, one inside and one outside the booth.

“They give us information if there is any issue, hourly turnout and also how many would have voted for us,” an I-PAC member said, adding: “If there are any problems such as less turnout in our strong polling booths, then we raise it to “booth-level mobilisers” [five per booth] and ask them to mobilise more people.”

Apart from the main room, the “war room” was divided into four teams.

In the main room, there was a large LCD screen that displayed excel sheets with details of all constituencies and two whiteboards.

He, along with NITI Aayog member V.K. Saraswat, launched the EPluto 7G vehicle by Pure EV on the premises of Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H), on Sunday. Addressing the gathering, Mr Reddy said that they are looking for innovations in defence technology and are ready to support them. Many startups have emerged in the past four years, he said while recalling the instance of a young entrepreneur’s material technologies idea.

The DRDO chief also mentioned that a proposal for 1,000 e-buses manufacturing plant near Hyderabad is under active consideration.

Mr. Saraswat said in 2020-2021, five to six 2 GWh battery manufacturing plants would come up and NITI Aayog was ready encourage those who come up with proposals. He said India is also considering getting lease of lithium mines abroad so that manufacturing cells will be easy, which costs 40% of the battery, in India.

‘Join hands with ARCI’

He also advised Pure EV to join hands with International Advanced Research Centre for Powder Metallurgy and New Materials (ARCI).

Pure EV CEO Rohit Vadera said EPluto 7G has a range of 116 km per full charge and runs with a maximum speed of 60 km per hour. Battery warranty is for 40,000 kilometres. He said the company presently has 50 outlets and they are going to increase it to 200 by the end of this year. He added that the vehicle has been designed to suit Indian terrain and weather conditions.

268,2020/02/09,TS told to build capacity in seed sector,"The International Seed Federation (ISF) has suggested the Telangana government to build its capacity to face the challenges in the seed sector with State having potential to grow into the regional seed hub of Asia to begin with.

Director of Telangana State Seed and Organic Certification Authority (TSSOCA) K. Keshavulu had a meeting with secretary-general of ISF, a non-government non-profit making body established in 1924 with a mission to create the best environment for the global movement of seed and promote plant breeding and innovation in seed, Micheal Keller in Geneva on Saturday and discussed about strengthening the seed sector in Telangana.

Mr. Keshavulu stated that he had explained to the ISF executive that Telangana had the most conducive conditions for quality seed production, processing, packaging and storage. That was the reason why about 400 private seed companies have their operations in Telangana doing an annual seed trade of about ₹6,000 crore.

In another meeting with the executive of Trade and Agriculture Directorate of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Seba Gaspar in Paris, Mr. Keshavulu urged the OECD to promote export of quality seed from India to the member countries. Although India became a OECD member in 2008 no efforts were made to certify seed with OECD protocols till Telangana became the designate authority for certification seed produced in nine States.

In 2016, TSSOCA took up export of certified seed to OECD countries for the time in the country and exported 7,241 quintals of paddy, maize, sorgum, sunflower, pearl millet and other seed in 2016-17, 8,028 quintals in 2017-18 and 6,800 quintals in 2018-19 to Egypt, Sudan, Philippines, Tanzania, Italy and other countries, Mr. Keshavulu explained. The OECD executive felt that there higher potential for seed exports from Telangana to more African countries.

269,2020/02/09,Akbaruddin urges KCR to develop Mahankali temple,"All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) floor leader in the Assembly Akbaruddin Owaisi requested Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to develop the Simhavauhini Mahankali temple at Lal Darwaja in Old City.

Mr. Owaisi, who called on the Chief Minister at Pragathi Bhavan on Sunday, recalled that Bonalu being held in the temple every year was reputed across the world as Lal Darwaja Bonalu, which witnesses thousands of pilgrims. The temple area could not be developed because of lack of space and this was in turn causing several problems to devotees.

The festival has more than a 100 years of history. “But the temple complex is situated in a 100-square yards area. Due to the narrow space, it is causing immense problems to lakhs of devotees,” he said in a memorandum submitted to Mr. KCR. He urged the CM to develop the temple and widen it at a cost of ₹10 crore.

“This development can result in loss of properties of people living in the vicinity. They can be compensated with a 800-square yards land at Fareed market, under the purview of the GHMC,” he added.

He wanted Mr. KCR to consider widening the temple on a priority basis and reminded that the CM himself had offered a golden bonum at the Mahankali temple.

Mr. Owaisi also requested Mr. KCR to sanction ₹3 crore for renovation of the Afzalgunj masjid.

The CM, according to an official release, responded positively to the requests and assured that funds required for the development of Mahankali temple and Afzalgunj masjid would be released soon.

270,2020/02/09,CCMB team’s follow-up discovery finds mention in ACS Neuroscience journal,"In a follow-up discovery published in the American Chemical Society journal, ACS Chemical Neuroscience, Professor Amitabha Chattopadhyay’s group from the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) here has now shown that modulating the levels of cholesterol - an important lipid in the cell membrane - could change serotonin1A receptor's internal mechanism.

‘Serotonin1A receptor’ is one such important drug target in neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression. Its function is regulated inside the cell through a process called endocytosis - a key event in the therapeutic action of several drugs, according to a release.

Cells in the human body body communicate with their surroundings through tiny nano-machines called G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) present in its outermost membrane which are major drug targets in almost all clinical areas.

Statin addition helps therapy

Prof. Chattopadhyay’s team had previously shown that the serotonin1A receptor regulates through specialized regions of the cell membrane, called clathrin-coated pits, and later recycles into the cell membrane.

When CCMB researchers treated cells with statin - the best-selling cholesterol lowering drug in the market - they observed that the serotonin1A receptor, instead of using its regular clathrin-coated pits, used alternate regions called caveolae. “We observed that this switch in the mechanism of internal regulation reverted to clathrin-coated pits when we put back cholesterol in cells without statin treatment”, said G. Aditya Kumar, a Ph.D. student and first author of the paper.

Experiments from the team also revealed that receptors that usually recycle back to the cell membrane in normal conditions started getting degraded inside cells when they were treated with statin.

Anti-depressant drugs, termed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), target the endocytosis of serotonin1A receptor as their mechanism of action.

Novel insights

“These results show cholesterol modulates cells internal mechanism and could provide novel insights into improved therapeutic activity of antidepressant drugs when administered in combination with statins,” said Prof. Chattopadhyay.

These studies from CCMB are especially relevant in the Indian context since the National Mental Health Survey (2015-16) reported that more than five per cent of the adult Indian population suffers from depression.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/x19x90/article30777991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy09CCMB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ccmb-teamss-follow-up-discovery-finds-mention-in-acs-journal/article30775502.ece

Of this annual budget, GHMC’s own component is ₹5,380 crore. The remaining ₹1,593.64 crore is to come through Telangana State Housing Corporation and the Hyderabad Road Development Corporation, towards road development and double-bedroom housing projects.

Responding to the budget proposals, former mayor and present corporator Majid Hussain pointed out that property tax dues were piling up from State and Central government buildings. GHMC’s share of professional tax and motor vehicle tax is not being recovered since long.

Low spending

Raising questions about low spending, Mr. Hussain questioned mere ₹23 lakh allocation for development of heritage structures, which was lower than the expenditure on refurbishment of officers’ cabins. Heavy penalties are being imposed in the name of construction material being dumped on roads, but not much is being spent on control of dengue and malaria, he rued.

Mr.Hussain also suggested special counters for issue of birth certificates given that 30% people in the city do not have birth certificates.

Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy and TRS MLA D.Sudheer Reddy brought to the notice of the chairperson and Mayor Bonthu Ram Mohan that property tax being levied in L.B. Nagar zone is much higher than in other localities, and sought its reversal.

Mr.Revanth Reddy also questioned 100% penalty on property tax of unauthorised construction and said it sought to penalise hapless home buyers instead of errant builders.

Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar, in his response, said four to five meetings have been held with the State Finance Commission about devolution of funds to GHMC. He also clarified on SRDP and double-bedroom projects in the city.

By August this year, about 65,000 to 70,000 double-bedroom dwelling units will be ready. They are in completion stage, requiring about ₹60 crore to ₹90 crore to touch finish line, he said.

Escrow account

277,2020/02/09,EVDM slammed for heavy penalties,"The Enforcement, Vigilance and Disaster Management (EVDM) wing of GHMC and its director Viswajit Kampati came under fire for imposing hefty penalties for minor violations at the GHMC general body’s budget meeting on Saturday.

The topic was broached by former Mayor and Corporator Majid Hussain during his response to the budget proposals for the year 2020-21 which were tabled by GHMC Commissioner D.S.Lokesh Kumar. Raising serious concerns about lakhs of rupees penalty being charged from hawkers, Mr. Hussain wondered if GHMC is targeting to raise its revenue more through Enforcement penalties rather than property tax earnings.

He also questioned if the penalties being charged by the enforcement wing came within the purview of GHMC Act, and if they were discussed in Standing Committee. Vigilance and Enforcement wing’s mandate is to keep watch on the functioning of government officials, and not to harass people jointly with them, he said.

Legislator D. Sudheer Reddy, during his response, objected to the hefty penalties of up to ₹25,000 for simple violations such as stacking of construction material in front of houses.

MLA Jaffer Hussain went a step ahead and launched a broadside against Mr. Kampati, accusing him of running a parallel administration in GHMC. Pointing out that the GHMC Act did not support any directorial posts, he sought to know if the post was created for one person. Narrating an instance where a Spoken English institute was charged ₹33 lakh penalty for tying flexis, the MLA demanded for a committee to pore over the work of EVDM over the past two years, and for a resolution surrendering Mr.Kampati to the government forthwith.

Corporator Vijaya Reddy also spoke against the penalties and requested for separation of Vigilance from Enforcement wing.

When Mayor Bonthu Ram Mohan tried to intervene by saying the decision to constitute EVDM was through a State government order, MIM legislator Syed Aminul Hasan Jafri objected that an executive order cannot supersede GHMC Act and that there was no provision for EVDM in the Act. Following this, the demand for repatriation of Mr.Kampati to his parent department only grew louder.

A war of words ensued between TRS and MIM members when MLC M.S. Prabhakar tried to come to the rescue of Mr.Kampati.

278,2020/02/09,Gang busted for taking loans in the name of dead people,"Cyberabad Police busted a gang of six persons who allegedly cheated several banks by obtaining loans in the name of deceased IT employees.

The accused were identified as Nimmagadda Phani Chowdary (33), Mandava Swaroop Nath Chowdary (34), P. Srinivas Rao (33), Kandru Harish (25), Narne Venu Gopal (35) and I. Veera Sekhar Rao (28).

The issue came to light when the family of one such deceased IT employee approached the police with a complaint stating that his credit card was being misused.

Police said Phani and Swaroop hatched a plan to take loans in the name of deceased persons by fabricating their IDs and other documents. They used the internet, especially social media, to search for potential victims and apply for new SIM cards which were in the name of their victims. For this purpose, Srinivas made the fake documents.

280,2020/02/09,‘Understand politics of reading’,"Education Minister C. Ravindranath on Saturday said that a realisation of the politics of reading was needed to instil a sense of the renaissance in social psyche.

Sense of direction

Talking at Krithi here, the Minister rued that the sense of direction that steered literature had not occurred in the case of reading. If the change that the renaissance brought in literature had met a concurrent growth in the politics of reading, the secular mind of Kerala would have remained rock solid. A book exists in society as a product of reading and therefore how one reads is important, he said.

Mr. Ravindranath said it was important to understand and promote the politics of reading. “Reading isn’t innocent or linear. So, it needs a sense of direction and unerring politics. In the pre-renaissance era, the effort of literary works was to create a sympathy for tradition and convention with a view to ensuring a climate favourable to conventional thoughts. But a change from moribund conventions to a sense of humanity was heralded by renaissance,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/understand-politics-of-reading/article30772808.ece

Therefore, there’s a photo and documents exhibition part of the ongoing edition of Krithi at Marine Drive.

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, who visited the fest on Friday, wondered how Kerala writers could run such a society for so long.

The exhibition displays rare documents and photographs related to SPCS since its inception in 1945.

The literary co-operative body was formed on April 30, 1945, and the documents beginning from the certificate that was issued while registering it as a co-operative in March, 1945, have been displayed at the exhibition. The others include the MoU reached in stamp documents between writers and the SCPS to publish their works and the minutes of SPCS meetings written by famed Malayalam writer and first SPCS secretary Karoor Neelakanta Pillai.

The photos displayed include that of the first NBS Branch started at Kottayam Kalarikkal Bazar in 1945 and the India Press started in 1965. Pages of NBS Bulletin started in 1962 are also on display.

282,2020/02/09,Concern over lack of clarity on developing key road,"The government’s lack of clarity on widening and extending Thammanam-Pullepady Road — an alternative to Banerjee Road and S.A. Road — despite the fear that traffic snarls at Palarivattom Bypass Junction and rest of the city may worsen with the commissioning of Vyttila and Kundannoor flyovers by April is testing the patience of commuters and landowners alike.

Landowners are concerned that Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac did not say anything in Friday’s Budget about developing it into a four-lane road and to simultaneously extend it to M.G. Road and NH Bypass, although he had announced here in December 2017 that the PWD would take over the road from the Kochi Corporation and develop it as soon as possible.

The government was dilly-dallying on developing the crucial corridor, even though PWD Principal Secretary R.K. Singh had in December directed the PWD (Roads wing) to prepare a DPR to develop the road in order to decongest Kochi, said Jayasankar P.S., an office-bearer of Thammanam-Pullepady Road Action Council.

It is estimated that 3.56 hectares costing approximately ₹379 crore is needed to realise the four-lane road. Furthermore, P.T. Thomas, MLA, demanded that the road be renamed as M.G. Road-NH Bypass Road, since it links the two arterial stretches in the city.

“Ideally, the government must develop the stretch in two phases. Priority must be given to the stretch from M.G. Road upto Kathrikakadavu Junction, since it is extremely narrow. Landowners and motorists are fed up of the ineptitude of the Kochi Corporation and consecutive State governments in developing the 3-km road. The worst affected are people who surrendered their land free of cost. On their part, landowners are unable to even sell off their lands since they were frozen over two decades ago for the road project,” he said.

The land acquisition tahsildar recently submitted details of land surveyed for acquisition to develop the corridor. Interestingly, part of the Kathrikadavu-Karanakodam stretch was widened as four lane, using the ₹25 crore allotted by the UDF government. It is yet unclear whether the road has been mentioned in the 24 road projects that the government had included in Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board’s (KIIFB) projects worth ₹4,104 crore that were announced in January. Residents’ associations and NGOs had for long been seeking more allocation to develop Kochi’s roads, since funds had not been allotted to the city when arterial roads in Thiruvananthapuram were developed under the City Roads Improvement Project (CRIP).

A review meeting held on December 19 had demanded that the Kochi Corporation pass a resolution handing over the road to PWD ‘unconditionally’, following the Kerala High Court’s intervention in the issue. On its part, the PWD was to do a detailed study, prepare a DPR and source funds from Kerala Road Fund Board (KRFB).",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/u13cf4/article30324387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16KIROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/concern-over-lack-of-clarity-on-developing-key-road/article30772798.ece
283,2020/02/09,Integrated traffic management on the anvil,"An Integrated Traffic Management System (ITMS) powered by vehicle density detection cameras will come into force at 21 important junctions in the city under the aegis of Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) in the next two months.

Under the ITMS, Area Traffic Control System will kick into action at these select signal junctions. A major highlight of the system will be the real-time adjustment of traffic signals integrated with vehicle density detection cameras unlike the present signals, which are pre-programmed and cannot be adjusted according to the vehicle density.

“It could also be controlled from the control room manually. So, unlike the present system, which demands deployment of personnel on roads to regulate traffic during a protest march or VIP movement, the control room can take over the command and regulate the traffic under the new system,” said S.P. Gopakumar, Head (Communications Division), Keltron.

“ITMS is scalable and can be expanded to cover nearly 120 traffic signals in the city in due course without adding further infrastructure,” he said.

Besides, the system will have red light traffic signal violation detection at four points and pelican crossings at another four junctions whereby pedestrians can turn the signal red for their crossing on flipping a switch.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/integrated-traffic-management-on-the-anvil/article30772796.ece
284,2020/02/09,Kochi surveillance to turn digital,"The city is set to receive 90 Internet Protocol-based digital megapixel cameras at 35 points under Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML).

The city has been in the ‘dark’ for the past few years after the entire lot of 99 cameras installed in multiple phases between 2009 and 2013 literally shut eyes after the optical fibre cables connecting them to the police control room at Thevara got dismantled following Kochi metro works.

Keltron is in the process of installing the new digital cameras, which are likely to be up in another one-and-a-half to two months followed by another batch of 400 digital cameras for which CSML has invited tenders.

“In short, almost the entire city will be covered by a network of nearly 500 cameras in the next six months,” said S.P. Gopakumar, Head (Communications Division), Keltron.

While the police are trying to restore as many cameras as possible with the technical expertise of Keltron, the fact remains that most of them were no longer reliable or durable.

“All of them were analogue cameras and their spares have literally vanished from the world market. Digital cameras now being installed powering ITMS are the most efficient ones and fit for the future,” Mr. Gopakumar said.

More importantly, the new digital cameras devoid of optical fibre cables are connected to the control room by dedicated BSNL lease lines, thus insulating them from any potential disruption owing to metro or road works. Besides, the first batch of 90 cameras will be covered under the annual maintenance contract of Keltron for five-and-a-half years.

The city police in the mean time are trying to bring the entire network of private CCTVs across the city under a single umbrella in association with residents’ associations, trade bodies, and NGOs. “The idea is to connect a link from these cameras to local police stations and the control room. The process is under way,” said S.T. Suresh Kumar, Assistant Commissioner, Control Room.

Meanwhile, the work of shifting the control room from Thevara to the city police commissionerate has got under way.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/9kam49/article30772794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09KISURVEILLANCECAMERA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/city-surveillance-to-turn-digital/article30772795.ece
285,2020/02/09,Government pulls up U.S. agency for work on Nipah virus,"The Indian government has sharply censured the U.S. government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for funding an “unapproved” Indian laboratory in Manipal, and not securing the necessary permissions for undertaking training in India for work on Nipah virus, considered a potential bio-weapon.

A Union Health Ministry communication to CDC said the work was undertaken despite knowing that high risk pathogens can be tested only in BSL4 lab. As the highest level of biological safety, a BSL4 lab consists of work with highly dangerous and exotic microbes. Infections caused by these microbes, including Ebola and Marburg viruses, are frequently fatal, and come without treatment or vaccines.

The Ministry said it is taking a “very serious view” of all such contraventions of virus research guidelines that bypass the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)/ Health Ministry Screening Committee (HMSC) for permissions.

When asked by The Hindu, the CDC admitted that the training programme did not have the necessary approvals “due to some confusion about clearance for private institutions,” but it had not commissioned the research directly.

Meanwhile, in a communication dated October 30, 2019, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said it had written to both CDC and Manipal Centre for Virus Research (MCVR), ordering them to shut down the study. It told the Manipal institute to transfer all the Nipah virus samples to the certified ICMR-National Institute of Virology in Pune, and demanded that CDC stop all unauthorised funding.

A memorandum sent out said the CDC was advised “to stop funding research without approval and working with Nipah virus — a pathogen that belongs to Risk Group 4 classification (RG4) considered lethal since it can be turned into biological weapons.”

“It has been brought to our notice that CDC had trained MCVR for diagnosis of Nipah virus disease (NIV) in spite of the known fact that NIV is BSL 4 level pathogen whereas MCVR is a level BSL2+lab. Prior to this training to MCVR, CDC has not consulted national/govt agencies as per norm. Since Nipah is a high risk pathogen with potential for being used as agent of bio-terrorism the samples were to be handled more carefully and tested only in a BSL4.”

In a written response to queries, directed through the U.S. Embassy, the CDC said, “The training was done through the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) and was aimed at strengthening laboratory systems in India which allowed for detection of Nipah virus.”

“All trainings followed appropriate biosafety precautions and procedures as per international standards and were attended by government of India laboratorians,” the Atlanta based CDC, said. According to the CDC, after “realising” the need for further permissions, it had subsequently applied for clearances with the Health Ministry, but those were denied.

“When the clearance was not obtained, the project was closed and no further funding was released to MCVR, in accordance with GoI and U.S. Government policy,” the CDC spokesperson added, but did not explain why it had been unaware of the procedures for funding in the first place.

Dr. Arunkumar, Director of MCVR, said: “We did not take approval from HMSC. Prior to testing, MCVR inactivated the virus. Inactivation of the virus was carried out in BSL3 facility at MCVR. Once inactivated, the virus cannot spread. Molecular testing was carried at MCVR in its BSL2 facility. No Nipah virus sample was transferred from MCVR to any other lab (except NIV) within and outside the country.”

“Nipah virus diagnostic training of MCVR by CDC in 2017 was under the supervision of GHSA cell in DGHS and was reviewed every quarter by DGHS and ICMR. The Nipah Virus diagnostic training was conducted at MCVR as part of the capacity building exercise under the CDC sponsored project on hospital based Acute Febrile Illness surveillance,” Dr. Arunkumar added.

MCVR is reported to have carried out tests on the Nipah virus during the outbreak in Kerala in 2018 and 2019. Dr. R. Gangakhedkar of the ICMR said the training was funded by the CDC and had no approval from HMSC.

“At the time the decision was taken (in 2018, after the outbreak), we were informed that MCVR is only a BSL2 facility. We were not aware that it has a BSL3 facility in the Centre. The entire exercise of testing samples lasted for 10 days or so. Everything happened in a small capsule of time,” he added.

286,2020/02/09,Why does the Environment Ministry want to regulate RO-based water filtration systems?,"The story so far: The Union Environment Ministry has issued a draft notification that seeks to regulate membrane-based water filtration systems in areas where the source of water meets drinking water norms of the Bureau of Indian Standards. This primarily affects reverse osmosis (RO)-based water filtration systems and the rules, at least in letter, effectively prohibit homes from installing domestic RO systems.

What are reverse osmosis (RO) systems?

RO was originally a technology devised to desalinate sea water. The idea exploits the principle of osmosis. Take a tube, twist it into a ‘U’-shape and insert a semi-permeable membrane (a material with very small holes that will allow only certain molecules to filter through) at the point where the tube curves. Fill half the tube with salt water and the other with freshwater. Over time, fresh water will cross over into the salty arm until the proportion of salt and water in both arms is the same. This is due to osmotic pressure which dilutes a region with a higher concentration of solute (in this case, the salt).

Say you wanted to readjust this tube and have all the salt in one arm and pure water in the other. You would need to create some external pressure that will counter the osmotic pressure and suck all the water from the salty arm into the freshwater arm while leaving the salt behind. This is the essential principle of an RO system.

RO desalination came about in the late 1950s and primarily in large industrial settings to convert brackish sea water into potable drinking water.

However, it is possible to deploy a wide array of membranes and multiple stages of filters to filter a wide variety of solutes — arsenic, fluoride, hexavalent chromium, nitrates, bacteria — that come mixed in water. This has led to an industry of home-RO systems that are installed in a multiplicity of ways to provide potable water.

Also Read Centre to bar domestic RO systems in places where tap water meets BIS norms

To create external pressure, RO relies on a pump and electric motors. It uses “activated carbon” components, such as charcoal and carbon black that can filter out contaminants as well as organic substances such as bacteria. It all depends on the filtering material and the number of filters that incoming tap water must pass through.

What is the problem with RO?

In making tap water pass through multiple stages of cleaning, RO systems end up wasting a lot of water. Anywhere between three-five times more water is wasted by them than they produce and given the challenges that cities and government face in providing potable water, environmentalist groups have convinced the National Green Tribunal to ban the use of RO systems in Delhi. It is as part of this legal dispute, which began in March 2019 that led the Environment Ministry to move to regulate RO systems.

Another concern with RO is that it filters out calcium, zinc, magnesium, which are essential salts needed by the body; drinking such water over time could be harmful. However, many manufacturers claim to overcome this challenge by “post-treatment”. The average RO system only aims to reduce Total Dissolved Solids, ensure water is odourless and has a pH from 6.5-8.5. The National Institute of Virology (NIV) claimed that most filtration methods did not eliminate Hepatitis E virus. A combination of filtration systems can eliminate most contaminants.

Also Read Purifying water: On draft notification on RO systems

But opponents of RO systems say this increases costs and reduces the incentive for public-funded water distribution systems to supply clean water to the vast majority of the country who can ill-afford such systems.

How is the quality of piped water in the country?

Under the Jal Jeevan Mission, the Prime Minister has committed to provide tap water to the entire country by 2024. However, studies show that the existing quality of piped water is deficient in much of India. Last year, the Department of Consumer Affairs undertook a study through the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) on the quality of piped drinking water being supplied in the country. In Delhi, all samples drawn from various places did not comply with the BIS’s requirements. Most from Mumbai were found to comply, the report claimed. In Hyderabad (Telangana), Bhubaneswar (Odisha), Ranchi (Jharkhand), Raipur (Chhattisgarh), Amravati (Maharashtra) and Shimla (Himachal Pradesh), one or more samples did not comply and none of the samples drawn from 13 State or Union Territory capitals, Chandigarh, Thiruvananthapuram, Patna, Bhopal, Guwahati, Bengaluru, Gandhinagar, Lucknow, Jammu, Jaipur, Dehradun, Chennai, Kolkata, complied with the requirements.

What is the quality of water globally?

Countries with a high development index tend to have good quality tap water. Finland, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom have access to freshwater lakes or glacier melt — extremely clean and mineral rich. This water is further filtered. Singapore and Israel rely on extensive recycling and even making sewage water fit for drinking. The limited population pressure, compared to India, as well as public resources allow these countries to ensure clean drinking water. But for much of the world, access to clean piped water from the public supply remains a challenge.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/57xziv/article30772350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/09THiStock-694238198,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/why-does-the-environment-ministry-want-to-regulate-ro-based-water-filtration-systems/article30772351.ece

291,2020/02/09,Petrol station run by prisoners on the anvil in Kozhikode,"As part of finding new vocational opportunities for prisoners, the district jail is planning to lease out about 25 cents of its land to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to set up a fuel station near Puthiyara road in the city. It will be the fifth of such joint projects initiated in Kerala, to be managed by IOC by employing prisoners.

Director General of Prisons and Correctional Services Rishi Raj Singh, who was at the district jail on Sunday for the inauguration of welfare projects, held discussions with IOC officials about the new venture and visited the spot.

Mr. Singh said the project was found feasible and would be implemented in the city with the support of IOC.

IOC officials said construction was under way in some of the already identified spots in Kerala. On completion, there would be altogether five petrol pumps covering the open jail in Kasaragod district, Kannur Central Jail, Viyyur Central Jail and Poojappura Central Jail, they said.

Officials at the district jail here said similar petrol pumps opened in other parts of the country were effective in generating a decent income for prisoners. Though IOC would be responsible for managing the project, labourers for the 24-hour functioning of the units would be provided by the jail, they said.

The Kerala Prisons and Correctional Services Department approved the proposal as it would give a chance to prisoners to interact with the public, thus meeting some of the objectives of the Correctional Services. IOC also came in support of the project as it was convinced of the effect of such projects on prisoners.

The rent of the land to be paid by IOC to the Prisons Department would be used for paying the wages of prisoners.

293,2020/02/09,Thousands of people witness float festival,"Thousands of people thronged Mariamman Teppakulam on Saturday during the annual float festival to get a glimpse of presiding deities of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple - Goddess Meenakshi and Lord Sundareswarar.

The 12-day festival reached its crescendo as the decorated temple float wafted through a brimming tank, on Thai Poosam, the birth star of King Tirumalai Nayak. The 22-acre tank housed a bright float - a replica of interiors of the Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple.

Joint Commissioner of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department and Executive Officer of the temple N. Natarajan said arrangements were made to ensure that images on the float was similar to sanctum sanctorum of the temple. They wanted to recreate the experience for those visiting it from far away places. “With enough water this year, people can see the idols even from a distance as the float is buoyant at a height. Floral arrangements and decoration of the tank have been made by experts from Tiruchi,” he said.

The float was taken around the tank twice from 11.15 a.m. As per convention, youth from the Devendrakula Velalar community from nearby Anuppanadi pulled the float around the central mandapam of the tank using nylon ropes. The group was led by Agniveeran who said that his family has been in the process of pulling the float since the tank was first built. Priests performed special pujas at the central mandapam.

Larger crowds can be seen in the evening from different parts of Madurai walking across PTR bridge to witness the float going around the tank. With colourful lights, sale of food items and knick knacks, the area was alive with devotional music.

Foreign tourists from different countries including France and Germany witnessed the event and watched a cultural show organised by the Tourism Department and Travel Club, Madurai. Its president Chitra Ganapathy said brochures were given to tourists explaining the story behind construction of the temple tank and its history.

Earlier, the deities were taken in a procession through Chithirai streets, East Masi Street, Yanaikkal, Nelpettai and Kamarajar Salai to Muktheeswarar Temple near Teppakulam.

297,2020/02/09,"Use of new technologies in roofing, wall construction will cut costs: Expert","Adopting new technologies in roofing and wall construction developed by Roorkee-based Central Building Research Institute (CBRI) helps save construction cost by around 30%, said CBRI chief scientist S.K. Negi on Friday.

Speaking on affordable housing at a two-day training programme for engineers and architects on ‘innovative technologies for construction of disaster resilient habitat’, Mr. Negi said compared to the conventional RCC slab roof the pre-cast RC plank roof technology saves about 25% cost, 75% time and 20% energy. Similarly, adopting brick point roof technology saves about 30% cost, 75% time and 5% energy.

Compared to conventional common brick wall, the stone brick wall construction saves 20% cost and time and 60% energy. The C-Brick wall technology saves 15% cost and 60% energy. The popular Rat Trap bond wall construction saves 20% cost and 25% energy, Mr. Negi said. The CBRI has made use of these affordable building technologies to come up with 130 specific designs of houses in 64 housing zones of 13 States under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Gramin scheme. These designs were developed on the yardstick that the structure lasts for four decades and the per unit construction of cost do not increase over the prescribed amount.

In Odisha, nearly 4 lakh of the 10 lakh houses constructed under PMAY-G have been constructed using technologies developed by CBRI. “The overall saving from use of our technologies in the PMAY-G has been almost 30%,” he said.

Executive director of Dakshina Kannada Nirmiti Kendra, Rajendra Kalbavi, said most technologies developed by CBRI have been adopted by the Kendra.

298,2020/02/09,Railway to bifurcate existing Bengaluru-Kannur/Karwar train?,"As against the popular demand for a dedicated overnight superfast train between Bengaluru and Karwar, the Railway Board appears to have decided to bifurcate the combined overnight express--Bengaluru-Kannur/Karwar-Bengaluru (16511/12-16513/14), and operate the Karwar portion via Padil bypass without touching Mangaluru.

Though the Board is yet to make any formal announcement, MP for Udupi-Chikkamagaluru Shobha Karandlaje gave a hint when she tweeted to thank Minister of State for Railways Suresh C. Angadi for his positive gesture on Saturday.

She said: “Hon. MoSR informed that it’s decided to run 16513 Karwar express via Padeel bypass which will save apx 2Hrs travel time”, and thanked him.

Rail activists however were not happy as they wanted a new service. Gautam Shetty from Kundapur, working in Bengaluru, who had been coordinating the struggle, said, “Delinking the combined express at Subrahmanya Road consumes about 30 minutes. While the Karwar portion may get about 10 coaches, the Mangaluru/Kannur portion may get 13-14 coaches. This arrangement would not serve any purpose,” he said.

Mr. Angadi a couple of months ago announced that a new train would run between Bengaluru and the coast. Activists resorted to a massive campaign to realise the announcement following South Western Railway’s reluctance to it.

SWR had been citing “restrictions” in the 55-km Ghat stretch between Subrahmanya Road and Sakleshpur as the reason handicapping it to run more trains on the section. Senior SWR officials told The Hindu the zone is working to get the restrictions relaxed so as to introduce more trains.

Mr. Shetty hoped that the bifurcation would be only a temporary arrangement till the Ghat restrictions were eased.

“Discrimination against the rest of the coastal area should stop,” he said. With the Karwar portion not touching Mangaluru, the train could reach Karwar by 11 a.m., he said urging SWR to further speed up the train between Nelamangala and Bantwal to take it to Karwar by 10 a.m.

300,2020/02/09,"Arctic ice melt is disrupting key ocean current, may alter climate in Western Europe: Study","Researchers have unravelled how an ocean water current, which plays a key role in keeping Western Europe warm, could be altered by an influx of unprecedented amounts of cold, fresh water from melting ice in the Arctic.

According to the scientists, including those from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the US, a seawater current called the Beaufort Gyre keeps the polar environment in balance by storing fresh water near the surface of the Arctic ocean.

Wind blows the gyre in a clockwise direction around the western Arctic Ocean, north of Canada, where it naturally collects fresh water from the melting of glaciers, and river runoff, the study, published in the journal Nature Communications, noted.

The researchers said this fresh water is important in the Arctic since it floats above the warmer, salty water, and helps protect the sea ice from melting - in turn regulating the Earth’s climate.

As the fresh water is slowly released by the gyre into the Atlantic Ocean over a period of decades, it allows the Atlantic Ocean currents to carry it away in small amounts.

However, since the 1990s, the researchers said, the gyre has accumulated a large amount of fresh water - 8,000 cubic kilometres - or almost twice the volume of Lake Michigan in the US.

According to the new study, the cause of this gain in freshwater concentration is the loss of sea ice in summer and autumn.

Due to this decades-long decline of the Arctic’s summertime ice cover, the Beaufort Gyre is more exposed to the wind, which has spun the gyre faster, trapping the fresh water in its current, the scientists noted.

The westerly winds have also persistently dragged the current in one direction for over 20 years, increasing its speed and size, as well as preventing the fresh water from leaving the Arctic Ocean, they said.

Where the winds used to change direction every five to seven years, this decades-long western wind is unusual for the region, the study noted.

If the wind changes direction again, the scientists said, it could reverse the current, pulling it counterclockwise and releasing the water it has accumulated all at once.

“If the Beaufort Gyre were to release the excess fresh water into the Atlantic Ocean, it could potentially slow down its circulation. And that would have hemisphere-wide implications for the climate, especially in Western Europe,” said Tom Armitage, lead author of the study from NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The release of fresh water from the Arctic Ocean to the North Atlantic can change the density of surface waters, the study warned.

Water from the Arctic loses heat and moisture to the atmosphere, and sinks to the bottom of the ocean, where it drives water from the north Atlantic Ocean down to the tropics in a conveyor-belt-like current called the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the scientists explained.

This current helps regulate the planet’s climate by carrying heat from the tropically-warmed water to northern latitudes like Europe and North America, and if it is slowed down, it could negatively impact all life forms, especially marine creatures, the study noted.

“We don’t expect a shutting down of the Gulf Stream, but we do expect impacts. That’s why we’re monitoring the Beaufort Gyre so closely,” said Alek Petty, a co-author of the study from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in the US.

The study also found that, although the Beaufort Gyre is out of balance due to the added energy from the wind, it expels that excess energy by forming small, circular eddies of water.

While the increased turbulence has helped keep the system balanced, it may also lead to further ice melt since it mixes layers of cold, fresh water with relatively warm, salt water below.

This could, in turn, lead to changes in how nutrients and organic material in the ocean are mixed, significantly affecting the food chain and wildlife in the Arctic, the researchers explained.

“What this study is showing is that the loss of sea ice has really important impacts on our climate system that we’re only just discovering,” said Petty.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/1fzd3b/article24839740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-ARCTIC-SEA-MELTPONDS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/arctic-ice-melt-is-disrupting-key-ocean-current-may-alter-climate-in-western-europe-study/article30775637.ece

302,2020/02/09,"Budget aftermath: reap the dividends, don’t fret","Ever since the Finance Minister presented the Union Budget proposals, there has been a lot of heartburn about dividends becoming taxable. Sit back and relax, nobody has moved your cheese. Let’s get the perspective on what is happening, and where you need to set the temperature to suit the new climate.

We will start with dividends from equity shares, then discuss dividends from Mutual Funds (MFs). The company paying dividends on its shares has to pay a dividend distribution tax (DDT) after which the dividends are tax-free in your hands. What the Union Budget has proposed is that the DDT be done away with. Rather, the dividend becomes taxable in your hands, at your rate.

Hence if you are in the 30% tax slab, you will now have to pay 30% tax on the dividends you receive. There are two issues in this. One, the numbers. The DDT paid by the company, to quote a round figure (giving up some decimals of correctness), is 20%. When DDT is no longer applicable, the company may bump up the dividend to that extent and pay a higher dividend as there is a relatively higher quantum at disposal. If you pay income tax at 30%, or higher including surcharge and cess, your net receipt is lower to the extent your taxation rate is higher than 20%. The other issue is psychological; something that is tax-free currently, becoming taxable.

Dividend yield

Let us now turn this issue on its head. There is a concept called dividend yield, which is the dividend received as a percentage of market price.

As an illustration, a company issues shares at a price of ₹10, which is the face value. Subsequently, the price goes up to ₹100 in the market, when you purchase it. The company earns a profit and declares a dividend of 15%. Now, this 15 is a percentage of the face value, hence you get a dividend of ₹1.5 per share.

However, as a percentage of the price you have paid for it, your yield is only 1.5%. In the new scenario, the company may pay a little higher than ₹1.5, as DDT would no longer be applicable. On the amount received, you will have to pay tax at 30%, depending on your income bracket. The crux of the matter is, most of the returns on equities come from price appreciation.

The dividend yield moving from 1.5% to say 1.4% does not make a material difference any which way.

In the equity market, this can be made up quickly from favourable price movement. As a reference point, the dividend yield on Nifty 50 stocks is only 1.3%. To be noted, (a) if you are in a lower tax bracket than 20%, you are better off in the new scheme of things (b) 30% is the marginal slab rate; your average tax rate is lower by virtue of the lower tax slabs (which are at less than ₹10 lakh as per current slabs) and (c) if you are holding significant equity and earn dividend of more than ₹10 lakh per year, you are anyway paying a tax of 10% on that.

Mutual funds

After dividend from equity stocks, comes the case of dividends from MFs. The Union Budget proposal is that DDT be done away with, and MF dividend becomes taxable in your hands at your rate. The difference with equity shares discussed above is that in MFs, there will be a TDS (tax deducted at source) of 10% in the dividend option.

What will change? Currently, in equity-oriented MF schemes, there is a DDT of 10% plus surcharge and cess. When this becomes taxable at your slab rate of say 30%, you pay 20% higher tax, or a little more than 20% if you are in a higher surcharge bracket. We said earlier, you have to re-set the temperature to suit the new climate.

In MF schemes, there are two options, dividend and growth. In the dividend option, the MF periodically declares dividend. In the growth option, there is no pay-out as such; the gains or accretions remain in the NAV, which you take home when you redeem.

In the growth option, it becomes long term if you hold for one year. After that, the gains from equity funds are taxable at 10% plus surcharge and cess. This does not change after the Union Budget. Moreover, up to ₹1 lakh of long-term capital gains per financial year is free from tax. Hence, you have to shift your investments off equity-oriented MF Schemes from dividend option to growth option and enjoy same / lower taxation.

There is a psychological aspect here as well. A dividend seems like an additional or bonus return. That is not the case. In the growth option, you have earned as much: it is there in the NAV. Rather, you earn a little higher in the growth option, as that component remains in the fund and continues to earn from the market for a longer period of time and gets the benefit of compounding.

For investors requiring regular cash flows, e.g. retired senior citizens, who are currently invested in the dividend option, they should switch to the growth option and take a Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP). In the dividend option, the quantum of dividend is decided by the AMC whereas in an SWP, you decide the quantum to be withdrawn regularly. Preferably, for tax efficiency, the SWP in the growth option should start after one year of investment for equity funds and three years for debt funds, for it to become long term from the tax perspective and enjoy a lower rate.

303,2020/02/09,"As new income tax regime beckons, should you switch?","The new personal income tax regime (‘PIT’) has become the talk of town. Taxpayers have started reviewing compensation structures and exemptions/deductions being availed to evaluate whether they should opt for the new PIT regime or stay in the existing one.

One such discussion took place in the Sharma household. The Sharma household consists of Mr. Raj (son, a software engineer), Ms. Sneha (daughter, recently graduated and working in a BPO in Hyderabad), Ms. Leena (mother, housewife) and Mr. Sharma, a retired bank officer. Mr. Sharma was elated that the Finance Minister had proposed the new PIT regime, wherein lower tax rates are prescribed. He showed his family, the income tax slab and rates applicable (Table 1)

Hearing this, Mr. Raj sought to check how much tax he would save, if he opted for the new PIT regime. Mr. Raj earns a gross salary of ₹55 lakh per annum and also claims several exemptions/deductions.

Mr. Sharma said in order to opt for the new PIT regime, Mr. Raj has to forego the following exemptions/ deductions and make a choice at the time of filing returns, viz. house rent allowance, leave travel concession, standard deduction of ₹50,000 and professional tax paid; allowances under section 10 (14), any allowance granted to meet the cost of travel on tour or on transfer; and per-diem ₹1,500 per minor child; interest paid on loan taken for self-occupied house property or vacant property; chapter VIA deductions that includes Section 80C (investments in LIC, ULIP, ELSS, tuition fee, provident fund, public provident fund, sukanya samriddhi yojana, tax-saving term deposit, national savings certificate, principal repayment of home loan); contribution to national pension scheme, except for employer contribution; medical insurance premium or medical expenditure or preventive health check-up expenditure paid for self and family; medical expenditure / insurance on a dependent who is a person with disability or for specified disease, contribution to national pension scheme; interest on educational loan; donations; interest on affordable home loan; interest on savings account/ term deposit; rent paid, where housing allowance is not provided by employer; free food and beverage provided by employer through vouchers.

Mr. Sharma further indicated that while the above exemptions were being taken away, the following exemptions continued — terminal benefits like provident fund, national pension scheme withdrawal; voluntary retirement compensation; Retrenchment compensation; gratuity; leave encashment, etc

Ms. Sneha said she had not availed most of the above exemptions and deductions and hence the new regime may be beneficial to her. Ms. Leena said, “Let’s make a comparison of the tax payable under the old and new regimes to determine whether the same is beneficial or not.” (Table 2)

Tax savings

In the table, Mr. Sharma and Ms. Sneha were glad to see tax savings of ₹28,600 and ₹14,196 respectively. Mr. Raj found he would pay additional tax of ₹2,60,365 if he opted for the new regime, primarily due to lack of exemptions / deductions and levy of surcharge (10%).

Mr. Sharma was also happy to know that he did not have to invest in tax-saving instruments, which means higher cash is available for spending, in addition to the tax saved! Ms. Sneha was also happy that she did not have to provide details of exemptions and deductions.

So, the option is a mixed bag. Taxpayers who do not plan or do not exhaust all avenues to plan taxes, may benefit from the new regime. Those who avail all exemptions and deductions stand to lose if they opt to switch over.

305,2020/02/09,12% tax revenue growth achievable in 2020-21 fiscal: Revenue Secretary,"A 12% growth in tax collections next fiscal may look ambitious to some but for Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey it is achievable in an economy that is projected to clock a 10% nominal GDP growth.

The economy slowing down to its slowest growth in 11 years together with a cut in corporate tax rates led to the government missing its tax collection target by a wide margin in the current fiscal. The tax shortfall also led to slipping on fiscal deficit target for the third year in a row.

In an interview to PTI, Mr. Pandey exuded confidence of meeting the tax collection target of ₹24.23 lakh crore for 2020-21.

“In 2020-21 the nominal growth that has been projected is 10%. So on a 10% (GDP) growth, getting a 12% growth in tax revenue is achievable,” Mr. Pandey told PTI.

The 2020-21 Budget has pegged gross tax revenues for 2020-21 at ₹24.23 lakh crore, up 12% from ₹21.63 lakh crore in the current fiscal.

Around ₹6.38 lakh crore is expected to come from personal income tax in 2020-21, a 14.13% increase over ₹5.59 lakh crore earned in 2019-20.

Besides, corporate tax revenue is budgeted to increase by 11.63% to ₹6.81 lakh crore in 2020-21, from ₹6.10 lakh crore in current fiscal.

For current fiscal, the government has revised downwards the tax collection projections from budgeted ₹24.61 lakh crore to ₹21.63 lakh crore in the revised estimates.

Mr. Pandey said the revenue growth budgeted for current fiscal was calculated assuming a 12% nominal GDP growth. However, the nominal GDP growth came in at 7.5%.

He said in the current fiscal, the gross tax revenue is 4% higher than ₹20.80 lakh crore collected in 2018-19 fiscal. However, the government had estimated an 11% gross tax revenue growth in 2019-20.

Explaining further, Mr. Pandey said, “This year we have shown a tax revenue growth of 4%. 7% growth we had to forego on account of corporate tax (cut). So 4% (growth) means actually 11% achievement. On 7.5% nominal growth if you are achieving 11% (tax revenue) growth, we can’t say that this is unrealistic”.

In September 2019, the government announced a cut in base corporate tax for existing companies to 22% from current 30%; and for new manufacturing firms, incorporated after October 1, 2019 and starting operations before March 31, 2023, to 15% from current 25%.

The effective tax rate for existing units, after considering surcharges and cess such as Swachh Bharat cess and education cess – which are levied on top of the income and corporate tax rates, will be 25.17% as compared to 34.94% now. For new units, it will be 17.01% as against 29.12% now.

The new tax structure cost ₹1.45 lakh crore in revenue annually to the exchequer.

This exercise will create six global-sized banks, effective April, and will bring down the number of public sector banks to 12 from 27 in 2017.

“We have successfully done the mergers and recapitalisation of the banks. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has been successful which has brought back more than ₹4 lakh crore to the banks. Further consolidation or merger will depend on the need,” Mr. Thakur told PTI in an interview.

Creation of global sized banks through consolidation will facilitate Modi government’s resolve to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25, he said.

Bigger banks would have wider reach, stronger lending capacity and better products and technology to serve customers of New India.

Last August, the government announced the merger of United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce with Punjab National Bank, making the proposed entity the second largest public sector bank (PSB).

It was decided to merge Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank, while Allahabad Bank with Indian Bank. Similarly, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank are to be consolidated with Union Bank of India.

In April 2019, Bank of Baroda in a first three-way merger exercise amalgamated Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with itself.

SBI had merged five of its associate banks - State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Hyderabad and also Bharatiya Mahila Bank with itself effective April 2017.

Listing of LIC

Asked about listing of LIC as announced in the Budget, Mr. Thakur said it will help bring in greater transparency, public participation and also deepen the equity market.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman while presenting the Budget 2020-21 on February 1 proposed to sell a part of government stake in LIC through an initial public offer next fiscal.

The government aims to garner ₹90,000 crore from the listing of LIC and stake dilution in IDBI Bank in the next fiscal out of total disinvestment target of ₹2.10 lakh crore.

The government owns 100% stake in LIC, and around 46.5% stake in IDBI Bank.

Budget 2020

Terming this year’s Budget ‘Jan Jan Ka Budget’, Mr. Thakur said every strata of the society has been taken well into consideration and major reforms have been undertaken benefiting youth, women, farmers, investors and the middle class.

The government has provided ₹2.83 lakh crore for agriculture, farmer welfare and rural development.

“Doubling farmers’ income is an agenda for the next two years. We have already fulfilled the commitment of one and a half times of cost of production of farmers which the government had promised,” he said.

With the announcement of ‘Kisan Rail’ and ‘Krishi Udaan’ to be launched by Indian Railways and Ministry of Civil Aviation, respectively, for a seamless national cold supply chain for perishables, this too will serve beneficial as it will aid farmers in facilitating smooth and fast transport of perishable goods, he said.

In addition, the government has increased agriculture credit target to Rs 15 lakh crore for the next fiscal.

Mr. Thakur said, “from startups to education, internship to apprenticeship, many announcements have been done...So, I think more young entrepreneurs, more startups we are going to see...We see India moving to top three startup countries in the world in the next couple of years.”

With regard to helping the MSME sector, he said, the government has asked the RBI to consider extending debt restructuring window by another year till March 31, 2021.

More than five lakh MSMEs have benefitted from restructuring of debt permitted by the Reserve Bank of India last year, he said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/ml5gd7/article30775863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAKUR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/government-open-to-further-consolidation-of-banks-depending-on-need-anurag-thakur/article30775864.ece
307,2020/02/09,"Government seeks to engage itself with businesses, industries: Nirmala Sitharaman","Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said that the government wants continuous engagement with industries and businesses and will act as a facilitator for hassle-free payments of taxes.

She was interacting with the members of trade and industries here, a week after presenting the Union Budget for 2020-21 in Parliament on February 1.

“The broad message which is apparent is that the government wants continuous engagement with industry and business. And my presence here is not in response to what is happening inside (country) and outside,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

She said the Centre has introduced some features in the budget like “faceless appeals and sorting out of problems while imparting tax administration”.

Ms. Sitharaman said this will be made possible only with the help of new technology.

“Over the years, we had to remove all the dead wood gathered with a pincer. This will help the government to fulfill its commitments made in the budget,” she said.

Referring to issues relating to GST, the finance minister said it is not the Centre to initiate steps for reduction of rates, the State ministers should also represent cases so that a synergy could be built.

ATMs

Responding to Tea Board chairman PK Bezbaruah’s remarks on the scarcity of ATMs in the tea belts of Assam and West Bengal for which “cashless wage payments are becoming a problem”, the finance minister said the government is willing to set up ATMs in pockets where there are none.

“I know that number of ATMs is minuscule in the tea growing regions. The government is ready to set up such facilities in these areas,” she said.

Finance secretary Rajiv Kumar said that “there is a need for credit offtake to pick up for genuine businesses”.

“Commercial lending has to go up. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has already appointed a committee to differentiate between genuine business failure and a fraud,” he added.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/bw0ooc/article30776341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIRMALASITHARAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/government-seeks-to-engage-itself-with-businesses-industries-nirmala-sitharaman/article30775484.ece
308,2020/02/09,Banking on petrol variants to make up for loss in view of BS-VI norms: Maruti,"India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India is banking on introduction of petrol variants of existing models such as Vitara Brezza besides exploring more CNG options to make up for lost numbers as it discontinues diesel options while moving to BS-VI emission norms.

The company, which last week showcased the petrol version of its popular compact SUV Vitara Brezza that was earlier available only in diesel option, is also gearing up to bring petrol version of its S-Cross model.

“We have the optimism to recover what we are losing in diesel through this increase in petrol. We have a double task. It is not like comparing current portfolio with next year, it is like current portfolio minus diesel in next year,” Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) Shashank Srivastava told PTI.

Elaborating the scale of task in hand, he said, “In April-January period, the contribution of diesel vehicles to (MSI’s) total sales was 21%. For this fiscal year it (total number of diesel vehicles sold by the company) is projected to be around 2.7-2.8 lakh units.”

In April-January, the company sold a total of 12,45,197 units in the domestic market as against 14,66,987 units in the year-ago period, down 15.1%.

“It is a marketing task and that’s the challenge. We will try. Vitara Brezza petrol is one of the main (models to drive up petrol vehicle volumes),” Mr. Srivastava added.

Exuding confidence of petrol Brezza to be accepted in the market, he said, “In entry-level SUV segment only competition sells 58% in petrol. That 58% can drop down dramatically if we add Brezza and that’s what we are trying to do.”

MSI is launching Vitara Brezza in petrol option powered by a 1.5 litre engine later this month, while it is gearing up to bring its premium crossover vehicle S-Cross, which was also available only in diesel option, with a petrol engine, in March.

Last year, the company announced that it would stop selling diesel vehicles, particularly small cars, as affordability would be an issue once BS-VI norms are implemented and it phased out diesel options gradually as it started rolling out only BS-VI compliant vehicles in petrol.

The company’s diesel vehicle line-up included Swift, Dzire, Baleno, Ciaz, Vitara Brezza, Ertiga and light commercial vehicle Super Carry.

MSI has, however, said it was not totally closed on reviewing its diesel strategy stating if there was demand even at higher cost from consumers for diesel vehicles, then it would consider upgrading its 1.5 litre diesel engine to meet BS-VI emission standards.

MSI Senior Executive Director (Engineering) C.V. Raman said a call to upgrade diesel engine to BS-VI standard would be taken after assessing demand from the market when the stricter emission norms are implemented.

He further said the other option available to the company is to increase its CNG portfolio to partially offset loss from discontinuation of diesel vehicles.

The company has eight popular models offered with CNG option.

“We will introduce (CNG option) on other models also because we have to expand further depending on customer requirement. We will do research and find out if there is requirement in all these areas. If required we will definitely do,” Mr. Raman said.

The company’s models which do no have CNG option are Swift, Baleno, Ciaz, Vitara Brezza and S-Cross.

He said the government’s plans to increase CNG stations to 10,000 will enhance penetration of CNG in existing locations and also add new areas on the CNG network map and MSI is working closely with the government.

“When they are increasing in existing locations they are easing filling of CNG and when they are opening in new locations we are able to reach to a larger population...We are mapping the whole thing. Then we will propagate and democratise more. This fiscal we may end up selling 1.1 lakh CNG vehicles and we will do more,” Mr. Raman said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/5ph40e/article30775479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARUTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/banking-on-petrol-variants-to-make-up-for-loss-in-view-of-bs-vi-norms-maruti/article30775480.ece
309,2020/02/09,"Government plans to sell 5% stake in Steel Authority of India Ltd., may rake in ₹1,000 crore","The government is planning to sell 5% stake in Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) through an offer for sale, which could fetch about ₹1,000 crore to the exchequer, an official said.

Officials from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) and steel ministry are planning roadshows in Singapore and Hong Kong for SAIL stake sale. However, the Hong Kong roadshow might be called off due to coronavirus outbreak.

The government holds 75% stake in SAIL. It had last sold 5% stake in the steel CPSE in December 2014.

“We are looking at a 5 per cent stake sale via offer for sale (OFS), but we will assess investor demand in the roadshows,” an official said.

At the current market price, the government may raise about ₹1,000 crore by selling 5% stake in the company. Shares of SAIL closed at ₹48.65 apiece on Friday, down 0.51% over previous close on the BSE.

The government may look at completing the transaction in the current fiscal as it strives to achieve the ₹65,000 crore disinvestment target set in the revised estimates.

So far this fiscal, ₹34,000 crore has been mopped up from CPSE stake sale and the remaining ₹31,000 crore has to come in by March-end.

For 2020-21, the government has budgeted to collect ₹1.20 lakh crore from CPSE stake sale.

The government is also planning to sell 10% stake in Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers Ltd (GRSE) through an OFS, out of its shareholding of 74.50%.

The stake sale would fetch about ₹200 crore to the exchequer at the current market price.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/lwgqqt/article30775201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/government-plans-to-sell-5-stake-in-steel-authority-of-india-ltd-may-rake-in-1000-crore/article30775202.ece

311,2020/02/09,Explained: How LIC stake sale will affect policyholders,"The story so far: In the Union Budget speech on February 1, Union Minister of Finance Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the government proposed to sell a part of its holding in Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) by way of an initial public offering (IPO). The state insurer was established in 1956 through an Act of Parliament. Governed by the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956, every LIC policy is guaranteed by the government. Explaining the rationale for divesting the government’s stake in LIC, Ms. Sitharaman said that listing would bring discipline while giving retail investors an opportunity to participate in wealth creation.

What is the implication for policyholders?

Before the government divests a part of its stake through a public issue, it will have to ensure that it amends the LIC Act, which among other things, ensures a sovereign guarantee for all policies under Section 37 of the Act. The Finance Ministry is in talks with the Law Ministry to amend the Act. The top brass of LIC are, however, banking on a government assurance on the issue. In a media interaction on Friday, LIC Chairman M.R. Kumar said: “There is no implication for policyholders. The Finance Minister has clarified that sovereign guarantee will continue. That being the case I don’t think there is anything to worry for the customer.”

Will listing change LIC’s operational approach or investment policies?

LIC is the biggest institutional investor in the Indian equity markets. According to media reports, LIC’s gross investments in equity are set to touch an all-time high of ₹72,000 crore in the financial year 2019-20. In comparison, foreign portfolio investors had invested just over ₹65,000 crore into Indian equity up to February 8, according to data posted on the National Securities Depository Limited website.

In FY19, LIC had invested a little less than ₹69,000 crore in equities. The numbers clearly show the clout that LIC enjoys in the equity market. The government has used LIC on many occasions to stabilise the markets.

Analysts cite the offer for sale of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC) in 2012 as a classic example of an LIC bailout. The insurer was allotted a 4.4% stake in ONGC, part of the 5% sold by the government through the auction route. LIC purchased almost 90% of the shares offered, taking up its holding to 9.48%, just under the permitted ceiling of 10% under insurance laws.

Questions were raised in the market at the time about its investment policies but since LIC was completely owned by the government, not much came of it. Analysts say this is the interesting part about the proposed listing. The listing would usher in benefits including increased accountability, transparency and due process. There would be independent directors on board who could question the rationale for investments. Further, shareholders too could question the company on its investments. “We are yet to do the math,” said Mr. Kumar when asked how investment norms would change post the proposed listing. “Generally, whether we are listed or not, we have to follow the same investment [norms],” he added.

Could listing change the payout structure at LIC?

Quite likely, according to analysts. Currently, LIC pays 5% of its surplus to the government and the balance 95% to policyholders. This makes it possible for the state-owned insurance company to give a higher bonus on the policies compared to private players, who typically give 10% of their surplus to shareholders and the balance 90% to policyholders. With outside investors becoming shareholders, with a few even gaining seats on the insurer’s board, there could be a demand to tweak the mix between shareholders and policyholders. Further, the norms of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on corporate governance would require the insurance company to make timely and quick disclosures about defaults among other things. LIC is a significant player in the debt segment as well and would have to make additional disclosures to retail shareholders.

Does LIC have bad loans?

At a time when all banks are reeling under the pressure of bad loans there is intense speculation on LIC’s non-performing assets (NPAs). While media reports have posited that LIC has about 6% gross NPAs. Mr. Kumar, however, clarified that on an overall basis, it was not even 1%. He said, “For us, most investments are in equity, government securities and a small part in corporate debt. The 6% is possibly in corporate debt. But overall, it is hardly 1% in gross [terms]. Since we made provisions, net [NPAs] is 0.04%.” LIC’s total assets amounted to ₹32.26 lakh crore as of September 2019.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/lv9dkd/article30772308.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LIC,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/would-lic-stake-sale-affect-policyholders/article30772309.ece
