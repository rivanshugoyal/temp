0,2020/01/24,Premier Badminton League season-5 | Superstarz down Raptors in a thriller,"Chennai Superstarz pipped Bengaluru Raptors 4-3 in their Premier Badminton League season-5 match here on Friday. In the day’s final tie, the home team’s Ranki Reddy & D. Kapila got the better of P.S. Chan and R.A. Saputro 13-15, 15-9, 15-9 to clinch the match.

After losing the first tie, the mixed doubles, Superstarz won their next two matches — both men’s singles — to tilt the scales slightly in their favour.

Earlier, the top-notch mixed doubles ‘Trump’ duo of Chan Peng Soon and Eom Hye Won dispatched Dhruv Kapila and Jessica Pugh 7-15, 8-15. Backed by strong performances from Tommy Sugiarto and Lashya Sen in men’s singles, Superstarz took a 3-2 lead.

World No. 2 Tai Tzu Ying defeated Gayatri Gopi Chand in the women’s singles as Raptors equalised 3-all. Gayatri delighted the spectators, who had come in large numbers to see the side play its last match at home, with delicate drops and matched Tai in all aspects, especially in the first game. But in the next two, Tai was superior.

Lakshya has been very impressive in the Chennai leg, winning all his three matches. His half-smashes and endurance have been of top class. Lakshya didn’t give even a whiff of a chance to Brice Leverdez in scripting a 15-5, 15-3 victory.

Sugiarto’s 15-13, 10-15, 15-11 triumph over Sai Praneeth was a true example of better tactics prevailing in the end.

Going for long rallies in the initial stages, Sugiarto stepped up the momentum after taking a 10-6 lead. He attacked more from the backcourt and stretched the Indian no end. Like Lakshya, Sugiarto, too, has been consistent, emerging victorious in all his three matches.

Gayatri said: “It was a dream-come-true playing against Tai. She has been my idol,” she said.

The results: Chennai Superstarz bt Bengaluru Raptors 4-3 (Dhruv Kapila & Jessica Pugh lost to Chan Peng Soon & Eom Hye Won (T) 7-15, 8-15; Tommy Sugiarto bt Sai Praneeth 15-13, 10-15, 15-11; Lakshya Sen (T) bt Brice Leverdez 15-5, 15-3; Gayatri Gopi Chand lost to Tai Tzu Ying 15-13, 6-15, 6-15, Ranki Reddy & D.

2,2020/01/24,Want to be medal contender: Kashyap,"P. Kashyap, at 33 years of age, has a decent chance to qualify for the Olympics for the second time.

According to Road to Tokyo-Badminton World Federation Olympic qualification rankings, Kashyap, at World No. 22, is third among Indians behind Sai Praneeth (11) and Sourabh Verma (21).

The Olympic rules state that nations may enter a maximum of two players each in men's and women's singles, if both are ranked in the world's top 16.

Likely route

The 2014 Commonwealth Games singles gold medallist is not too worried about making the cut. “We have eight to nine tournaments [before Tokyo]. [Am] not sure whether I’ll play all. I have been saying this from last year. Just qualifying for Olympics doesn’t excite me.

“I want to be a contender for a medal. We [men’s singles] have to aim for that,” he said.

“I want to get back into shape. Two years back I was thinking of quitting, but got some confidence after some good results last year.”

Ranked as high as No. 6 in April 2013, Kashyap conjured up similar form last year. He started his good run in March in the Indian Open (BWF Tour Super 500) where he reached the semifinals (lost to Viktor Axelsen) and then entered the Canada Open (BWF Tour Super 100) final and in September, made it to the semifinals of the Korea Open (BWF Tour Super 500).

But, Kashyap is not reading too much into his performances.

“I want to keep improving. The last three years, I have been struggling as I kept getting injured. I was not able to train 100 per cent. However, in the last six months I have been feeling a bit better, lost a few close matches at the end of the year,” he said.

On PBL

On the Premier Badminton League, Kashyap, playing for Mumbai Rockets, said: “It’s something like a change, where there is a different kind of atmosphere, and good team spirit,” said the 2012 London Olympics quarterfinalist.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ojdbsp/article30646712.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24KASH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/want-to-be-medal-contender-kashyap/article30646713.ece

4,2020/01/24,Virk leads after three rounds,"Junsher Virk led with 72 out of 75 after three rounds on the opening day of the third National shotgun selection trials in men’s trap at the Dr. Karni Singh Range here on Friday.

Arjun Singh recovered nicely after shooting 21 in the first round, with two perfect rounds of 25, and found himself one point behind the leader, along with Shamsher Singh Chauhan and Manavaditya Singh Rathore.

Bahl revealed. “We have proposed it to the DG and it is taking shape. It has to have a track, a sand-pit, throwing areas. A multi-gym is also planned. It will take time. Expert agencies are involved. As of now, it is at a conceptual stage, but I do not think it will take more than six months or so to start work.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/track-and-field-area-may-be-renovated/article30645354.ece
6,2020/01/24,Zero tolerance for sexual harassment: SAI Bengaluru,"A week after it emerged that over 40 complaints of sexual harassment had been reported at Sports Authority of India campuses across the country over the last decade, the SAI Southern Centre here reiterated that it had a zero-tolerance approach to such incidents. On Friday, the SAI observed National Girl Child Day, organising a ‘walkathon’, a lecture on sexual harassment and a self-defence demonstration class. Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Capt. Ajay Kumar Bahl from the Indian Navy, Senior Director, SAI, stressed that spreading awareness and education were the way forward.

“What happened in the past is out of my purview. How we are proceeding now is what I can tell you. We are pursuing a three-pronged approach — creating awareness, educating them, and then creating physical barriers. We are having education programmes — frequent lectures, classes etc. Anyone who comes in is told that there is zero tolerance to sexual harassment. Even intentions of that kind will not be tolerated. What actions you will take comes afterwards. Once you get this message to penetrate society, the chances of such incidents become low,” he said.

Fifteen months ago, the SAI Southern Centre here had also been rocked by a case of alleged molestation, with a senior kabaddi coach accused of misbehaving with a young pupil. Male coaches were being given strict instructions, stated Capt. Bahl. “A coach should know about the extent to which he can go. Because there are few sports like wrestling and boxing which are combat sports. A certain amount of contact will be there. But if a girl or a kid knows the difference between a bad touch and a good touch, they are aware. And now we can put cameras everywhere. So you have to educate them, keep them under surveillance and finally it has to grow into the society,” he said.

Young female athletes did not have to withhold complaints against coaches for fear of their careers being jeopardised, Capt. Bahl stated. A project to install complaint boxes — with no camera surveillance in the area, guaranteeing anonymity — is already under way. “There has to be that kind of a confidence where she says an individual (coach) doesn’t make the system,” he said. “The onus lies on the hierarchy of the system. We have to safeguard the interest of the athlete.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/lwuzwc/article30645529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25BAHL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/zero-tolerance-for-sexual-harassment-sai-bengaluru/article30645344.ece
7,2020/01/24,RFI emergency EC meeting tomorrow,"The Rowing Federation of India (RFI), which was de-recognised by the Union Sports Ministry allegedly for violating the Sports Code 2011 during its last elections held in Hyderabad where Ms. Rajalaxmi Singh Deo and Mr. M.V. Sriram were elected President and the Secretary-General respectively, has convened an emergency executive committee meeting here on Jan. 25 to resolve the issue.

The meeting has a two-point agenda — restricting the number of voters to two in the electoral college instead of the previous three and also barring any proxy voting.

These were the guidelines RFI apparently violated during the elections as per the Union Sports Ministry, which also asked the IOA to discharge the functions of the rowing body.

“We decided to convene this meeting and to go for fresh elections after making necessary amendments to our constitution incorporating the guidelines to implement the Sports Code,” former RFI president C.P. Singh Deo told The Hindu.

“Unfortunately, an impression has been created as if there was lot of fraud in the elections.

“The proxy voting in the RFI was never aimed at rigging the whole process.

“It was only to ensure the votes of those who could not come are cast.”

“What is perplexing is that the ministry could have just sent us a communication specifically suggesting that these two amendments had to be made to comply with the Sports Code with regard to election process,” Deo said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/rfi-emergency-ec-meeting-tomorrow/article30636612.ece
8,2020/01/24,Premier Badminton League season-5: A come-from-behind win for Awadhe Warriors,"Awadhe Warriors started its Premier Badminton League season-5 campaign with a come-from-behind 4-3 win over North Eastern Warriors here on Thursday.

Subhankar Dey gave the finishing touches for Awadhe with a clinical 15-9, 15-13 result over the higher-ranked Tanongsak Sansomboonsuk in the fifth and deciding tie.

Trailing 1-3, Awadhe Warriors put its weight behind the top-notch ‘Trump’ South Korean pair of Ko Sung Hyun and Shin Bak Cheol in the fourth tie.

Making it count

The 2014 World champion duo made it count as it overcame a fighting Krishna Prasad and Lee Yong Dae 8-15, 15-14, 15-12 to enable Awadhe to equalise.

Krishna and Lee had their chances to finish the fourth tie and the contest in the second game, but failed to do so. The third game, too, went close but the South Korean pair maintained a handy lead throughout to put Awadhe back in contention.

Earlier, North Eastern appeared the better team on paper in the mixed doubles. Bodin Isara and Kim Ha Na, however, faltered at crucial moments to lose to the Awadhe duo of Ko and Christinna Pedersen 8-15, 15-11, 15-14. In fact, at 14-14 in the decider, Kim fluffed her service by dumping it into the net.

But North Eastern fought back in the second tie through the men’s singles. Trump player Lee Cheuk Yiu, with his effortless and deceptive game, took apart Wong Wing Ki Vincent 13-15, 15-10, 15-11.

The 28-year-old Michelli Li from Canada tamed Beiwen Zhang 15-13, 15-14 in the women’s singles to give North Eastern a 3-1 lead, before Awadhe staged its comeback.

The result: Awadhe Warriors bt North Eastern Warriors 4-3 (Ko Sung Hyun & Christinna Pedersen bt Bodin Isara & Kim Ha Na 8-15, 15-11, 15-14; Wong Wing Ki Vincent lost to Lee Cheuk Yiu (T) 15-13, 10-15, 11-15; Beiwen Zhang lost to Michelle Li 13-15, 14-15; Ko Sung Hyun & Shin Bak Cheol (T) bt Krishna Prasad & Lee Yong Dae 8-15, 15-14, 15-12; Subhankar Dey bt Tanongsak Sansomboonsuk 15-9, 15-13).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/4iu6kh/article30637873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24PBLCITY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/premier-badminton-league-season-5-a-come-from-behind-win-for-awadhe-warriors/article30637874.ece

13,2020/01/24,Uncertainty over Fed Cup in China following the outbreak of the coronavirus in some parts,"There was a cloud of uncertainty over the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania Group-1 women’s tennis tournament, scheduled to be held in Dongguan, China, from February 4 to 8, following the outbreak of the coronavirus in some parts of China.

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the All India Tennis Association Akhouri Bishwadeep, said that the national federation had sought advice from the International Tennis Federation on the subject.

Six team in the fray

There will be six teams in the competition, playing on a league basis, with the top two getting promoted for World Group-2 play-off, while the bottom two would get relegated to Asia Oceania group-2.

China, Chinese Taipei, Indonesia, Korea and Uzbekistan will be the other teams apart from India.

The Indian team will also be anxiously following the recovery of Sania Mirza who had retired midway through the first round of women’s doubles at the Australian Open with a calf muscle strain.

Ankita Raina, Riya Bhatia, Rutuja Bhosale and Karman Kaur Thandi are the other members of the Indian team, which will have Vishaal Uppal as the captain and Ankita Bhambri as the coach.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/uncertainty-over-fed-cup-in-china-following-the-outbreak-of-the-coronavirus-in-some-parts/article30646745.ece
14,2020/01/24,Australian Open | Coco Gauff springs a surprise on Naomi Osaka,"Serena Williams crashed out, 15-year-old Coco Gauff stunned Naomi Osaka and Roger Federer survived a five-set thriller as the form book went flying out of the window at the Australian Open on Friday.

Men’s title-holder Novak Djokovic eased into the last-16, but elsewhere there were surprises all over Melbourne Park with Serena the biggest victim and Federer fighting back from 4-8 down in a fifth-set tie-break with John Millman.

Slam bid shattered

Serenas’ bid for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam was shattered by the unlikely figure of China’s Wang Qiang, who triumphed in three tough sets — after winning just one game when they played at the US Open in September.

Gauff then stepped up her giant-killing Melbourne debut as she ousted Japanese defending champion Osaka, 22, in dismissive style, winning 6-3, 6-4 in just 67 minutes to reach round four.

Federer came within a whisker of repeating his 2018 US Open upset by Millman as he was taken to five punishing sets by the tough Australian.

Clawing back

The 20-time Grand Slam champion was facing defeat in the super tie-breaker but he clawed back from 4-8 down to clinch his 100th win at the Australian Open.

“Oh God, it was tough,” said Federer. “Thank God it was a super tie-breaker (10 points), otherwise I would have lost this one.

With Serena now 38, older than Gauff by 23 years, the two players are at opposite ends of their careers.

And with Serenas’ close friend Caroline Wozniacki retiring on Friday, after defeat to Ons Jabeur, it looked like a change of guard in women’s tennis.

Not giving up hope

But Serena, who has now had eight winless Grand Slams since returning from childbirth, said she hadn’t given up hope of matching Margaret Court’s 47-year-old record for Slam titles.

“I definitely do believe (I can equal it) or I wouldn’t be on tour,” said Serena.

Serena was the bookies’ favourite to lift the trophy for the eighth time but she came unstuck against a determined Wang, who won 6-4, 6/7(2), 7-5.

Her defeat came just minutes after Denmark’s Wozniacki was knocked out by Tunisia’s Jabeur, bringing a tearful end to the former World No. 1’s final tournament before retiring.

Barty’s road clear

Serenas’ exit removes a major hurdle for Australia’s World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty, 23, who had been on course to meet her in the semifinals.

Barty, bidding to become the first Australian champion since 1978, hit form in a 6-3, 6-2 demolition of Elena Rybakina, saying she had played her best tennis so far this year.

Gauff, who trained with Serena Williams in the off-season, had promised she would be less nervous than in her last meeting with Osaka, when she was thrashed in round three of last year’s US Open.

And so it proved as the teenager broke once in the first set and twice in the second to floor a rattled Osaka and ramp up a rivalry that could run and run.

In the men’s draw, reigning champion Djokovic thrashed Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 to reach the round of 16 at a canter.

Tsitsipas ousted

But Greek sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas was also on the receiving end of an upset as he went down in straight sets to Canada’s Milos Raonic, the World No. 35.

Former US Open champion Marin Cilic, 31, outlasted Robert Bautista Agut in five tough sets and Tennys Sandgren, under fire during his last deep run in Melbourne over links to right-wing activists, beat fellow American Sam Querrey in straight sets.

Divij bows out

India’s Divij Sharan and his New Zealand partner Artem Sitak were knocked out of the men’s doubles competition after going down in straight sets to Bruno Soares and Mate Pavic on Friday.

Divij and Sitak lost to the Brazilian-Croat pair 7-6, 6-3 in a second round match that lasted one hour and 17 minutes.

With Divij’s loss, India’s campaign in the men’s doubles ended as Rohan Bopanna had made a first-round exit on Wednesday.

Bopanna is the only Indian left in the fray now and will partner Ukraine’s Nadiia Kichenok in mixed doubles.

17,2020/01/24,Australian Open | Federer survives huge scare to reach last 16 on freaky Friday,"Roger Federer faced down local battler John Millman 4-6 7-6(2) 6-4 4-6 7-6(8) in a five-set thriller on Friday night to reach the last 16 of the Australian Open and restore some normality to Melbourne Park after a day of big upsets.

The 20-times Grand Slam champion made an extraordinary 82 unforced errors to go with 62 winners as he went toe-to-toe with the world number 47 over more than four hours on Rod Laver Arena to secure his 100th Australian Open victory.

Millman, who got the better of the Swiss at the 2018 U.S. Open, had all the early momentum and won the opening set before Federer grabbed the second on a tiebreak and the third with a late break of serve.

The tireless Australian was never going to fold, however, and took the fourth set before forcing the third seed to battle back from a break down to seal the victory in the tiebreak.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/g9my4k/article30645222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ROGERFEDERER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-federer-survives-huge-scare-to-reach-last-16-on-freaky-friday/article30645223.ece
18,2020/01/24,Serena Williams stunned by Wang Qiang at Australian Open,"Serena Williams’ bid to win a 24th Grand Slam title has been falling short with losses in finals. At this Australian Open, she didn’t make it nearly that far.

Serving only so-so, failing to convert all but one of her break chances and missing groundstrokes with alarming regularity, Williams stunningly exited in the third round at Melbourne Park, beaten 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 by 27th-seeded Wang Qiang of China on Friday.

Williams was broken in the final game, fittingly ending things with a backhand into the net. That was her 27th unforced error on the backhand side, part of a total of 56 miscues. Wang made only 20.

The moment of a LIFETIME!

Williams owns seven trophies from the year’s first major championship and this was her earliest defeat there since also bowing out in the third round all the way back in 2006.

Wang quickly surpassed those game and point totals Friday, thanks in large part to nearly flawless play in the first set.

She saved all four break points she faced in that set, accumulated 10 winners and made just five unforced errors. Wang picked up the lone break she needed at love with an easy forehand putaway winner that made it 5-4.

Soon enough, Williams was sailing a backhand return long to cede the set. Wang quickly went up in the second, too, and already was ahead by a break at 4-2 when she was a point away from earning another.

But Williams — so tough at the toughest moments for so many years — steadied herself there to hold and get within 4-3. There was still work to do, though, and when Wang served for the victory at 5-4 in the second, Williams came through.

She was 0 for 5 on break points until then but the sixth time was the charm. On the point of the match, with both players slugging away from the baseline, it was Williams who did what it took to take it, smacking a cross-court forehand winner out of Wang’s reach on the 24th stroke.

Williams raised both arms and looked at her guest box in the stands, where her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, and husband, Alexis Ohanian, rose to their feet to celebrate.

All that did was prolong things, though. Eventually, Williams’ comeback fell short.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/uh5ajk/article30640766.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1201560645THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/serena-williams-stunned-by-wang-qiang-at-australian-open/article30640767.ece
19,2020/01/24,Tearful Caroline Wozniacki heads into retirement after Australian Open defeat,"A tearful but happy Caroline Wozniacki headed into retirement on Friday after a 7-5 3-6 7-5 third-round defeat at the hands of Tunisia's Ons Jabeur ended her participation in the Australian Open and her 16-year career.

The 29-year-old said last year that Melbourne Park, where she won her lone Grand Slam title two years ago, would be the site of her final outing as a tennis professional.

Wozniacki, one of the most popular players on the women's circuit, sat beside the court soaking up the atmosphere for a few moments before addressing a packed Melbourne Arena.

“I'd like to thank the fans, the support we feel on court is really amazing. Also the support I've had my from family, and especially my dad, who has coached me all those years,” she said, smiling through the tears. “I usually don't cry, sorry, those are the special moments I'll remember. It's been really amazing, a great ride. I really am happy, though, I'm ready for the next chapter.”

Wozniacki was renowned for having one of the best defences in the women's game but Jabeur ushered her out of the door with a barrage of 43 winners.

The Dane showed the fighting spirit of a champion to battle back from 3-0 down in the deciding set but Jabeur always looked to have the measure of her service when she was able to keep her big shots within the lines.

Wozniacki lost her final service game as a tennis professional and her last stroke was a forehand that went long to send the Tunisian world number 78 into the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time.

“I think it was only fitting that my career would end with a three-setter, a grinder,” Wozniacki laughed. “And that I would finish my career with a forehand error, these are the things I have been working for all of my career.”

With the entire crowd on its feet applauding, Wozniacki completed her final afternoon on court by performing a lap of honour draped in the Danish flag.

Jabeur, who beat 12th seed Johanna Konta in the first round and former world number four Caroline Garcia in the second, will next face the winner of the match between Serena Williams and Wang Qiang.

“I'm really happy, usually I lose in the first round at this Grand Slam,” said the 25-year-old. “I don't have much experience so I had some nerves, especially in the third set.

“I'm really lucky that I played you Caro,” she added, turning to Wozniacki. “You have been such an inspiration.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/gwdskd/article30640760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Caroline-Wozniacki,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/tearful-caroline-wozniacki-heads-into-retirement-after-australian-open-defeat/article30640761.ece
20,2020/01/24,Samsung's HC Hong who put India on world map begins new chapter,"HC Hong, President and CEO of Samsung Southwest Asia since 2015 and was instrumental in taking India to the top of global smartphone manufacturing map, has moved on into a new role within the company, according to a letter accessed by IANS.

Hong is likely to take over as the head of Samsung’s Latin America business, reliable sources told IANS.

“It’s been my great privilege to work so closely with you and grow together. During the last five years, we have delighted our consumers and added tremendous value to our business,” Hong said in a letter addressed to partners.

In 2015, Hong launched Samsung’s ‘Make for India’ initiative, which focuses on consumer-centric India innovations.

Samsung’s ‘Make for India’ strategy went on to become a huge hit, inspiring competition to launch local programmes for the country later.

Hong was instrumental in putting India firmly at the centre of global smartphone supply chain, with the inauguration of the world’s biggest mobile manufacturing factory by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Noida in 2018.

The Noida factory will hit production capacity of 120 million mobile phones annually by 2020.

In Bengaluru, the company inaugurated Samsung Opera House, the world’s largest mobile experience centre under his guidance.

“Thank you for your support in every step of that journey -- from ‘Make in India’ to ‘Make for India’ and ‘Make for the World,’ Hong said in the letter.

Hong began his career with Samsung Electronics in 1987 and has been in leadership roles in many countries over the last 30 years.

He was previously President of Samsung Electronics Latin America between 2012 and 2014. He also successfully headed Samsung Electronics’ sales subsidiary in Chile during 2009-2011.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article16057316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th18-SAMSUNG-pt+GU6NTFBV.3.jpg.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/samsung-s-hc-hong-who-put-india-on-world-map-begins-new-chapter/article30641805.ece
21,2020/01/24,Tencent offers to acquire Funcom Games for $148mn: Report,"Tencent Games, the world’s largest gaming company with hits like PUBG: Mobile and Arena of Valor, has announced a $148 million offer to acquire all shares of Norwegian game developer Funcom.

Back in October 2019, Tencent acquired a 29 per cent stake in Funcom from KGJ Capital to become the company’s largest shareholder.

Tencent already owns big stakes in many leading gaming developers, such as Riot Games, Epic, Supercell, Ubisoft, Paradox, and Frontier.

“We are impressed by Funcom’s strengths as a developer of open-world multiplayer, action and survival games. Funcom has a strong track-record in developing new titles with long life span.

22,2020/01/24,Amazon asks judge to block Microsoft from Pentagon project,"Amazon Web Services (AWS), the retail giant’s Cloud arm, has asked a US judge to force a stay of work on Microsoft’s $10 billion Cloud contract until the court can rule on Amazon’s protest over the Pentagon awarding JEDI to Microsoft.

Amazon had sought ‘preliminary injunction’ from the court to temporarily block Microsoft from starting work on the billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) project.

In a statement shared with Fast Company, an AWS spokesperson said that it is common practice to stay contract performance while a protest is pending.

“It’s important that the numerous evaluation errors and blatant political interference that impacted the JEDI award decision be reviewed. AWS is absolutely committed to supporting the DoD’s modernisation efforts and to an expeditious legal process that resolves this matter as quickly as possible,’ the spokesperson added.

Amazon filed a motion asking a federal judge to block Microsoft from working on any substantive tasks for the JEDI project while the court considers the matter. The motion makes good on Amazon’s previous pledge to try to pause work on the contract while the legal challenge is underway.

Amazon last year filed a suit with the US Court of Federal Claims contesting the decision.

“AWS is absolutely committed to supporting the Department of Defense (DoD’s) modernisation efforts and to an expeditious legal process that resolves this matter as quickly as possible,” the AWS spokesperson said.

Microsoft is set to start its work on JEDI Cloud contract from February 11.

The US government in October awarded the much-anticipated $10 billion Cloud contract for Pentagon to Microsoft.

In its complaint against the government decision, Amazon alleged Trump abused his position to put “improper pressure” on decision—makers for personal gains and show his hatred towards Bezos who owns The Washington Post.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/d7jwr7/article30641197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04NETAMAZON,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/amazon-asks-judge-to-block-microsoft-from-pentagon-project/article30641164.ece
23,2020/01/24,Twitter CEO refused to host fundraiser for Tulsi Gabbard,"Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey declined to host a fundraiser for US presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard (Democrat--Hawaii) late last year when she approached him.

According to ReCode, Dorsey, who has given donations to Gabbard’s campaign was hesitant to publicly back candidates.

One reason could be the fact that Gabbard is critical of big tech companies including Twitter, the report said on Thursday.

“Gabbard, a member of Congress from Hawaii, has said that as president, she would “absolutely” consider breaking up Twitter too, along with other tech companies that she deems “monopolies” that are “censoring” critical voices.

Dorsey donated $2,800 to Gabbard’s 2020 campaign last June, according to a Federal Election Commission (FEC) filing. He also contributed $1,000 to former tech executive Andrew Yang in March.

After Dorsey received criticism for his donations to candidates, he tweeted.

“I’ve made personal contributions because I appreciate Andrew’s focus on the coming displacement of work due to AI and automation, and Tulsi’s strong anti-war stance. Along with systematically addressing climate change and economic injustice, these are the key issues of global consequence I want to see considered and discussed more.”

Gabbard sued Google last year, alleging the tech giant violated her right to “free speech” when it briefly suspended her campaign’s advertising account.

Gabbard, however, has never met Dorsey, who is also CEO of financial services company Square.

“I had not met or spoken to him. I saw that the contribution was made and reached out and said ‘thank you so much,’ and he expressed his support for my candidacy,” she told a reporter recently.

Gabbard, however, acknowledged that Twitter would “absolutely” be among the companies that she would consider breaking up.

“Cosmos aligned. We will be back at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View for this year’s #GoogleIO on May 12-14,” tweeted Google CEO Sundar Pichai.

Last year, Google announced the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL at I/O. This year, the company is expected to launch the rumoured Pixel 4a at the event.

The upcoming Google Pixel 4a, which is expected to be the successor of the budget Pixel 3a, is likely to have a punch-hole display.

Google launched the Pixel 4 in October, but it decided not to release it in India.

According to the new leaks, the Pixel 4a has tried to match the design of the standard Google Pixel 4 very closely.

But unlike the Pixel 4’s dual sensor at the back, the budget 4a is likely to have a single camera sensor, in addition to a rear fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm headphone jack and the same USB-C port and bottom-facing speakers.

The 5.7- or 5.8-inch display of Pixel 4a utilises the punch-hole for the front-facing camera sensor in order to make the bezels appear much slimmer compared to its predecessor Pixel 3a, suggest the leaks.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/z7mv63/article30643022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24NETGOOGLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/google-io-2020-set-to-kick-off-on-may-12/article30643023.ece

28,2020/01/24,U.S. says 34 troops diagnosed with traumatic brain injury after Iran strike,"The Pentagon said on Friday that 34 service members had been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury following missile strikes by Iran on a base in Iraq earlier this month.

Mr. Trump and other top officials initially said Iran’s attack had not killed or injured any U.S. service members.

Last week the U.S. military said 11 U.S. troops had been treated for concussion symptoms after the attack on the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq and this week said additional troops had been moved out of Iraq for potential injuries.

Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told reporters that eight service members who had been previously transported to Germany had been moved to the United States. Hoffman said the service members were transported earlier Friday and would receive treatment at either Walter Reed military hospital or their home bases.

Nine service members remain in Germany and are undergoing evaluations and treatment.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump appeared to play down the injuries, saying he “heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things.”

29,2020/01/24,41 million people in 13 cities locked down as virus spreads in China,"Chinese authorities rapidly expanded a mammoth quarantine effort aimed at containing a deadly contagion on Friday to 13 cities and a staggering 41 million people, as nervous residents were checked for fevers and the death toll climbed to 26.

While the World Health Organization (WHO) held off on declaring a global emergency despite confirmed cases in half a dozen other countries, China expanded its lockdown to cover an area with a total population greater than Canada’s.

A range of Lunar New Year festivities have been cancelled, while temporary closures of Beijing’s Forbidden City, Shanghai's Disneyland and a section of the Great Wall were announced to prevent the disease from spreading further.

The previously unknown virus has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed hundreds across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-03.

The WHO said China faced a national emergency but stopped short of making a declaration that would have prompted greater global cooperation.

The outbreak emerged in late December in Wuhan, an industrial and transport hub of 11 million people in China’s centre, spreading to several other countries, including the U.S.

China is in the midst of its Lunar New Year holiday, a typically joyous time of family gatherings and public festivities.

But on Friday, Wuhan was a ghost town, its streets deserted and stores shuttered.

Worried patients

Hospitals visited by AFP journalists bustled with worried patients being screened by staff wearing full-body protective suits.

At a temperature-check station, a medical staffer in bodysuit, face mask and goggles took a thermometer from a middle-aged woman, pausing to examine the reading before quickly turning back to the patient.

One 35-year-old man surnamed Li voiced the fears of many. “I have a fever and cough, so I'm worried that I'm infected,” he said. “I don't know the results yet.”

With hundreds of millions of people on the move across China for the holiday, the government has halted all travel out of Wuhan, shut down its public transport and told residents to stay home. Deepening the isolation, there were few flights available to the city.

Besides Wuhan, 12 other smaller cities nearby have battened down the hatches, with most of them going public on Friday with various measures ranging from closing public venues and restricting large gatherings to halting public transportation and asking citizens not to leave their cities.

Several of the cities have populations numbering several million, led by Huanggang, which has 7.5 million.

The pathogen — 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) — has caused many outlets in Shanghai, Beijing and other cities to sell out their stocks of face masks.

State broadcaster CCTV reported that 40 medical doctors from the military were being brought in to help with intensive care.

In addition, 405 medical workers were being sent to Wuhan from Shanghai, said state news agency Xinhua, with the first set of 135 flying in Friday night.

On Friday, staff in full body protective suits were seen checking the temperatures of people entering a subway station in Beijing.

Thermal cameras scanned passengers arriving at Beijing's West Railway Station.

31,2020/01/24,"Iraqis protest, seek ouster of U.S. troops","Thousands of supporters of populist Iraqi cleric Moqtada Sadr gathered in Baghdad on Friday for a rally to demand the ouster of U.S. troops, putting the protest-hit capital on edge.

The march rattled the separate, months-old protest movement that has gripped the capital and Shiite-majority south since October, demanding a government overhaul, early elections and more accountability.

Thousands of men, women and children massed under grey skies in the Jadiriyah district of east Baghdad, chanting “Get out, get out, occupier!”

Some waved signs in Arabic and English reading “Death to America” and one protester carried a cardboard cut-out of the U.S. President Donald Trump on the gallows.

A representative of Sadr took to the stage at the protest site and read out a statement by the influential Shiite cleric and populist politician.

It called for all foreign forces to leave Iraq, the cancellation of Iraq’s security agreements with the United States, the closure of Iraqi airspace to the U.S. military and surveillance aircraft and for Trump not to be “arrogant” when addressing Iraqi officials.

“If all this is implemented, we will deal with it as a non-occupying country – otherwise it will be considered a country hostile to Iraq,” the statement said.

About two hours into the rally, protesters began peeling away from the square but thousands lingered.

America’s military presence has been a hot-button issue in Iraq since a U.S. strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and a top Iraqi commander outside Baghdad airport on January 3.

Around 5,200 U.S. troops are in Iraq to lead a global coalition in fighting the Islamic State group, but Iraq said the strike against Soleimani violated that mandate.

Joint US-Iraqi operations were paused and outraged parliamentarians voted for all foreign forces to leave.

Baghdad said it wanted to discuss a timeline for departure but US special envoy for the anti-IS coalition, James Jeffrey, said Thursday there was no “real engagement”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e9ojjd/article30646569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAQ-SECURITY-SADR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iraqis-protest-seek-ouster-of-us-troops/article30646565.ece
32,2020/01/24,President Gotabaya’s remarks on missing persons spark concern,"President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s recent remarks that those reported missing from the time of the civil war were “actually dead” have sparked concern among families of disappeared persons.

Relatives, mostly women, of thousands reported missing have been protesting in Sri Lanka’s Tamil-majority north and east for nearly three years now, demanding that authorities share the whereabouts of their children/husband, forcibly disappeared during the years of the brutal war between the State armed forces and the rebel LTTE. “We cannot accept the new President’s remarks,” said Leelathevi Ananthanatarajah, secretary of the Association for the Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances in the North and East.

Missing after surrender

“My 34-year-old son surrendered to the Army at the Omanthai checkpoint, just after the war ended in May 2009. We were all there. They said they would question him and release him. I am still waiting,” she told The Hindu.

The lingering concern over enforced disappearances has remained a key issue in the decade after Sri Lanka’s civil war ended, with affected families relentlessly demanding truth and accountability.

President Rajapaksa told the UN Resident Coordinator in a recent meeting that the missing persons were dead, adding that most were “taken by the LTTE or forcibly conscripted.”

Ms. Ananthanatarajah does not agree. “How can it be that those who surrendered to the Army were also killed by the LTTE? That too after they declared that the war had ended?” she asked.

Tweeting on the development, Tamil MP M.A. Sumanthiran said: “President @GotabayaR seems to know that even those who were surrendered to the military AFTER the war ended have died! He should publicly say HOW those 3,000 odd people (as revealed in the #LLRC Report) died. #accountability #UNHRC #lka Tamil”. The Jaffna legislator was referring to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, a panel set up by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2010.

Another activist based in the eastern Ampara district, whose husband surrendered in 2009, said the President’s remarks will not stop those like her from protesting. “They cannot issue a death certificate, give us some money and think we will stop. Our protest is about the truth and justice. We will agitate until we get the answers,” said the woman activist, requesting anonymity, as she “feared surveillance”.

Official response

Meanwhile, following media reports of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s remarks based on the official statement, the presidential media division — pointing to some media reports — clarified that the President did not mention a specific number of disappeared persons, in his conversation with the UN official. The President also said that after “necessary investigations”, steps would be taken to issue death certificates and provide support for the families, his office said in the latest statement.

Sri Lankan leaders and government bodies have referred to different figures, while speaking on the issue of disappearances. In 2016, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga —who was then heading the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation — told reporters various commissions since 1994 had documented that 65,000 people were “missing or not found to be dead"". This figure is said to include those who went missing during the southern JVP insurrections. The Office on Missing Persons, set up in 2018, said upto 20,000 people could be missing since 1983.

33,2020/01/24,"Donald Trump should be removed if found guilty, says Schiff","Democrats serving as prosecutors in U.S. President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial in the Republican-led Senate will make their case he improperly interfered in Congress’ probe of his dealings with Ukraine in their final day of arguments on Friday.

Democratic managers from the House of Representatives will try to convince Senators and the U.S. public that the Republican President is guilty of the charge of obstructing Congress for withholding key witnesses and documents from the investigation.

Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, the lead House manager, said Mr. Trump had used U.S. foreign policy for his own personal interest, and that failing to oust him from office would open the door to a “lot of damage”.

“This is why if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters and truth matters. Otherwise we are lost,” Schiff said in his closing argument on Thursday.

The Democratic-led House impeached Mr. Trump last month on that charge and a separate charge of abuse of power for allegedly trying to coerce Ukraines government into digging up dirt on former Vice-President Joe Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

The impeachment trial in the Senate, the third such proceeding in U.S. history, will determine whether Mr. Trump is ousted from power less than 10 months before he faces re-election.

The Constitution sets out the impeachment process for removing a President who commits “high crimes and misdemeanors.” Mr. Trump denies wrongdoing, while his Republican allies argue his conduct does not rise to the level of an impeachable offence.

Once Democrats conclude their opening arguments, Mr. Trump’s legal team will have up to 24 hours over three days to mount a defence. Senate Republicans are expected to acquit him.

34,2020/01/24,Coronavirus: Woman in Chicago becomes second patient to be infected on U.S. soil,"A woman in Chicago in her sixties on Janurary 24 was confirmed as the second patient on U.S. soil to be infected with the novel coronavirus that has afflicted hundreds in China, health officials said, with 50 other suspected cases under investigation.

“I'm pleased to report she is clinically doing well and is in stable condition,” said Allison Arwady, Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health.

Nancy Messonier, senior official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the agency had so far tested 63 samples from patients across 22 U.S. States for the 2019 Novel Coronavirus.

Eleven were found to be negative and two positive, and the CDC was working to make diagnosis kits more nationally available. At present the testing is occurring at the agency's headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The Chicago patient had travelled to Wuhan in late December before returning to the U.S. on January 13, Mr. Arwady said, a few days before health screenings began at major airports for travellers originating from the central Chinese city that is at the centre of the outbreak.

The woman began experiencing symptoms and called her health care providers, and was later admitted to hospital and placed in isolation. “She has not taken public transportation, have not attended any large gatherings and, she has not had extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning from China,” added Mr. Arwady.

The U.S. confirmed its first case of the infection earlier this week, a man in his thirties from Washington State who had also travelled to Wuhan recently and also reported himself to authorities after developing mild symptoms.

Neither of the cases were detected by the airport screenings that began on January 17, said CDC official Martin Cetron, and both patients had no symptoms or fever when they first arrived in the U.S. China has placed a travel ban across a vast region encompassing 13 cities and more than 40 million people, and the U.S. was now “re-evaluating” its approach of carrying out airport screenings, added Mr. Cetron.

“First and foremost, I want to say that we do have confirmed fatalities in this case, at least two confirmed fatalities,” Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said at a press briefing.

Aerial video showed the shredded and collapsed wreckage of the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing building smouldering but no longer flaming, along with widespread damage to area homes and businesses from the force of the blast.

The moment of the explosion, around 4.25 a.m. CST (4.05 p.m. IST), was captured on a home security camera, also aired on KTRK, that showed a blinding flash in the distance, followed by a fireball.

Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the blast was felt as far away as 22 km, based on social media reports.

“(The explosion) knocked us all out of our bed, it was so strong,” Mark Brady told KPRC television. “It busted out every window in our house. It busted everybody’s garage door in around here. ... It’s a war zone over here.”

Another neighbour identified only as Kim said her family was trapped in her home until rescued.

“The whole house is ruined,” Ms. Kim said. “The whole ceiling crashed down on all of us. We were all trapped in there, and a nice family came and helped us out. It’s trashed. It’s just trashed. ... Every house was devastated.”

A spokesman for Aalen police said a suspect was arrested after the shooting and no further suspects are believed to be at large.

37,2020/01/24,Hospital in Wuhan to be built within 10 days,"China is rushing to build a new hospital in a staggering 10 days to treat patients at the epicentre of a deadly virus outbreak that has stricken hundreds of people, state media reported on Friday.

The facility in the central city of Wuhan is expected to be in use by February 3 to serve a rising number of patients infected by a coronavirus.

Dozens of excavators and trucks were filmed working on the site by State broadcaster CCTV.

The hospital will have a capacity of 1,000 beds spread over 25,000 square metres (270,000 square feet), the official Xinhua news agency said.

Construction began as reports surfaced of bed shortages in hospitals designated to deal with the outbreak, which has now infected 830 people across China.

Xinhua said the new facility is aimed at “alleviating the shortage of medical treatment resources and improving the ability to care for patients”.

38,2020/01/24,El-Sissi dubs Egypt ‘oasis of stability’ amid clampdown,"Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said on Thursday his country has become “an oasis of security and stability” under his rule, amid reports of a new clampdown on dissent in the lead-up to the eighth anniversary of the 2011 pro-democracy uprising.

Mr. El-Sissi, who became president in 2014, spoke at the annual ceremony celebrating Police Day, which falls on Jan. 25. That’s the same date that thousands of Egyptians took to the streets to begin a sweeping revolt that forced longtime dictator Hosni Mubarak to step down in 2011.

Meanwhile, human rights activists have complained that authorities are randomly stopping people in downtown Cairo, the epicenter of the 2011 uprising, for fear that similar demonstrations could erupt.

""The whole world has seen how Egypt has turned into an oasis of security and stability in only a few years,” el-Sissi told a large audience of government officials, commanders in the country’s security apparatus and religious leaders in the lavish auditorium of Egypt’s police academy in eastern Cairo.

""I will always value and take pride in the fact that you and your fellows in the armed forces are facing a fierce battle against dark terrorism,” he said.

In 2013, Mr.El-Sissi, then defense minister, led the military’s overthrow of Mohamed Morsi, an elected but divisive president who hailed from the ranks of the Muslim Brotherhood. The nation’s oldest and largest Islamist organization was outlawed and branded a terrorist group the same year. Since then, el-Sissi’s government has been battling an Islamic insurgency, mainly in the Sinai Peninsula.

Last fall, thousands were arrested, including prominent academics, journalists and politicians following rare protests that erupted on Sept. 20 following corruption allegations leveled by a self-exiled businessman against the president and his military. Hundreds were subsequently released.

On Wednesday, the Interior Ministry issued a statement alleging that the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood was plotting to “spread chaos” and “undermine the country’s stability” by using cyberspace to call for protests and rioting on Jan 25. The statement said authorities had arrested members of the Muslim Brotherhood and discovered several weapon caches. Plotters were coordinating their efforts with fugitive militants who reside in Turkey, the statement added.

In recent weeks, there have been calls on social media to take to the streets Saturday to protest el-Sissi’s rule. More than the usual number of police vehicles have been been seen in and near downtown Cairo since last week.

""Downtown Cairo has turned into a military barrack. It is full of secret police who would stop anyone,” said Mohamed Zaree, a human rights activist with the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies. He said police were checking the smart phones of those arrested for any possible incendiary political content.

""What is going on definitely has to do with the upcoming anniversary of the Jan. 25 revolution,” said Zaree. “The regime is always scared that the Jan. 25 scenario might get repeated.”

Since el-Sissi’s ascent to power, state officials and state-controlled media have spread the narrative that the 2011 uprising was the outcome of a conspiracy by the Brotherhood and its regional allies, namely Turkey and Qatar. His government even renamed the Jan. 25 national holiday as Police Day instead of The Revolution Day, in a move widely seen by the regime’s critics as an attempt to erase the memory of that day.

""Today coincides with the anniversary of the Jan. 25 revolution with its noble demands that the Egyptian citizen would lead a dignified life,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article17958710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THPRIYAVIKTORORBAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/el-sissi-dubs-egypt-oasis-of-stability-amid-clampdown/article30640775.ece
39,2020/01/24,North Korea names sharp-tongued army figure as foreign minister,"North Korea has named a sharp-tongued former army officer with little foreign policy experience as its top diplomat, in a possible indication it will take a harder line with Washington in stalled nuclear negotiations.

Ri Son Gwon’s new title as foreign minister was disclosed Friday in a Korean Central News Agency dispatch that said he attended a reception for foreign diplomats in Pyongyang the previous day.

South Korean and other outside media outlets have recently reported North Korea informed foreign diplomats in Pyongyang, of Mr. Ri’s job last week.

In his speech at the banquet, Comrade Ri Son Gwon said that the Korean people have turned out in the general offensive to break through head-on the barriers to the advance of socialist construction by dint of self-reliance ... and made public the foreign policy stand of the (North Korean) government,” KCNA said.

Mr. Ri, an outspoken retired army colonel who previously headed a government body responsible for relations with South Korea, has taken part in numerous inter-Korean military talks over the past 15 years. But Mr. Ri, who is also an alternate member of the ruling Workers’ Party Central Committee, lacks experience in negotiations with the United States and other countries.

In South Korea, he is most known for what were seen as rude remarks to South Korean businessmen visiting Pyongyang in September 2018. While they were eating naengmyeon, Korean traditional cold noodles, Mr. Ri asked them: Are naengmyeon going down your throats? in apparent dissatisfaction with a lack of progress in efforts to promote inter-Korean economic projects, according to South Korean officials and lawmakers. Many conservatives in South Korea strongly criticized him.

Mr. Ri replaced Ri Yong Ho, a career diplomat with broad experiences who had taken part in nuclear negotiations with the United States since early 2018. It wasn’t immediately known what happened to Mr. Ri Yong Ho, whose name was last mentioned in KCNA last August.

Analyst Cheong Seong-Chang at South Korea’s private Sejong Institute said Ri Son Gwon’s appointment signaled North Korea would further harden its stance toward the U.S. and bolster a push to cement its position as a nuclear state.

From now on, it’s difficult to expect meaningful progress in North Korea-U.S. diplomacy, Mr. Cheong said.

Nuclear talks between the US and North Korea have progressed little since the breakdown of the second summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam in February 2019. Kim recently said North Korea would strengthen its nuclear arsenal and unveil a new strategic weapon after the US failed to meet a year-end deadline set by him to make concessions.

A senior State Department official told reporters Wednesday that Washington was aware of Ri Son Gwon’s reported appointment and hopes North Korea will understand the importance of resuming diplomacy.

There’s nothing to be gained by not talking. It’s only to their benefit, so we encourage them to talk, the official said on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to speak publicly to the matter. It is slow, patient, steady diplomacy. We’re going to stick with that plan.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/w606ub/article30640691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NORTHKOREANEWFOREIGNMINISTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/north-korea-names-sharp-tongued-army-figure-as-foreign-minister/article30640692.ece
40,2020/01/24,"For hippo Fiona’s 3rd birthday, zoo seeks aid for Australia","The Cincinnati Zoo is using the third birthday of its beloved hippo, born premature, as a way to raise money for Australian wildlife affected by the recent bushfires.

Instead of sending birthday gifts for Fiona, the Ohio zoo is asking people to buy T-shirts that will directly benefit the Bushfire Emergency Wildlife Fund. The shirt features a koala and kangaroo giving Fiona a hug and says “Supporting Our Friends Down Under.”

All proceeds from sales of the shirts will be sent to Zoos Victoria to help them care for suffering animals. The zoo will add $5,000 to the total amount raised.

Fiona became a global celebrity after she was born on Jan. 24, 2017, weighing in at just 29 pounds (13 kilograms). The normal range for a hippo’s birth weight is 55 to 120 pounds (25 to 55 kilograms). Fiona now weighs a healthy 1,300 pounds (590 kilograms), according to the zoo.

""Fiona won the hearts of Cincinnatians when she fought to survive after being born six weeks early and terribly underweight,” Cincinnati Zoo director Thayne Maynard said. “Three years later, people all over the world are still crazy about this normal, healthy hippo.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gc7q51/article30640656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PREMATUREHIPPOBIRTHDAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/for-hippo-fionas-3rd-birthday-zoo-seeks-aid-for-australia/article30640657.ece

42,2020/01/24,Saudi Arabia denies case of coronavirus infection,"A Saudi health ministry affiliate said on Thursday there were no cases of coronavirus in the kingdom, denying earlier reports of an expatriate resident being infected.

Earlier, India's Minister of State for External Affairs said an Indian nurse working at a hospital in southwestern Saudi Arabia has been infected by the coronavirus and was being treated, amid an outbreak that has killed at least 18 people in China.

But the Saudi Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a tweet that there were no cases of the novel coronavirus so far.

Another statement from the Saudi health ministry said that the case mentioned in the Indian minister's tweet was related to an infection with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and was being dealt with.

“The ministry has taken all the precautionary measures to deal with this global issue and is in close coordination with all concerned entities,” the statement added.

The kingdom said on Wednesday it would start screening passengers arriving from China and take other preventive measures following the outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.

The virus, which can pass from person to person, has been reported in Thailand, Japan and South Korea, raising concerns about its spread through international air travel. More than 630 people have been infected, mostly in China, but cases have been detected as far away as the United States.

Elsewhere in the Gulf region, Qatar and Bahrain called on their citizens in China to exercise caution against the virus, the state news agency reported on Thursday.

Kuwait's Ministry of Health said that thermal cameras were added to border crossings so passengers arriving from countries affected with coronavirus could be thermally screened, according to the state news agency.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v799lv/article30582676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/saudi-arabia-denies-case-of-coronavirus-infection/article30640482.ece
43,2020/01/24,Family receives remains of 6 killed in El Salvador massacre,"El Salvador’s forensic institute on Thursday turned over to family members the remains of six of the more than 200 rural residents killed by soldiers in August 1982 El Calabozo massacre.

Juana de JesŴs Bonilla Realegeũo cried over the caskets of her parents, three sisters and a sister-in-law.

""Thank God we have come to recover the bones of our relatives,” she said.

The remains were exhumed late last year and will be buried in El Calabozo, where soldiers are accused of burning homes and killing mostly women, children and the elderly over several days during the country’s civil war.

""It’s hard for me to receive their bones, but it gives me strength and I have to be strong to demand justice,” she said. “They were massacred, it was a slaughter of innocent people.” Her sisters were aged 10, 14 and 18 when they were killed and the oldest was pregnant.

""They killed old people, women and children, burned houses, stole everything we had and threw the bodies in the river,” said Marţa Berta Realegeũo, another relative.

Former human rights prosecutor David Morales who represents the victims, pushed in 2016 for the reopening of the case. A general amnesty had blocked its investigation, but the Supreme Court declared the amnesty unconstitutional. He said the Supreme Court had ordered that the El Calabozo case be reopened and investigated.

A report from the United Nations Truth Commission after the war said “there exists sufficient evidence that on Aug. 22, 1982 soldiers of the Atlacatl Batallion deliberately killed more than 200 civilians, men, women and children it had captured without resistance.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tsbex1/article30640633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELSALVADORMASSACREREMAINS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/family-receives-remains-of-6-killed-in-el-salvador-massacre/article30640440.ece

46,2020/01/24,Zareen Khan is Bollywood’s first tour guide with 'Jeep Bollywood Trails',"In San Francisco, one can sign up for tours that revisit locations where iconic films like Mrs Doubtfire and Dirty Harry were shot. A museum in Tokyo has recreated the magical worlds from Studio Ghibli’s films, with forest creatures, sprites and even a giant stuffed version of the Cat Bus. In London, fans can walk through the famous Portobello Road market full of buskers, cafés and spice shops, much like Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant did in Notting Hill.

World over, it is possible for cinema buffs to live their movie dreams on guided tours and behind-the-scene visits at some of the most iconic film locations. In India, though, this trend in tourism is yet to catch on. Apart from the stray excursions to Mumbai’s Dharavi (thanks to Slumdog Millionaire), most film tours are limited to studio visits in Mumbai (Film City) and Hyderabad (Ramoji Film City). A step in the right direction towards changing this is Jeep Bollywood Trails. The show, hosted by actor Zareen Khan, revisits the beautiful locations where films like Bang Bang, Jab We Met, Raanjhanaa and Dhadak were shot. In every episode, as Khan explores the locations, there is also a section where the directors of these films talk about their experiences shooting there. Premièring today, the show’s first episode will take audiences to Chail Palace, Druk School and Pangong Lake in Ladakh, which formed the backdrop for director Rajkumar Hirani’s 3 Idiots.

As for the actor, she describes herself as a ‘hippie traveller’. Give her a backpack with the bare essentials and a one-way ticket out of Mumbai and she wouldn’t ask for anything more. “I like to go into the interiors, meet people and taste different cuisines, even if it is from the streets. I want to know and experience the region’s culture, its history, food and the people,” says Khan, who was thrilled when she got the opportunity to host the travel show.

On the work front

For the 32-year-old actor who made her Hindi film début opposite Salman Khan in Veer exactly a decade ago, hosting Jeep Bollywood Trails for the small screen has meant there is no character for her to hide behind. While most would see this as a huge challenge, Khan insists it was one of her reasons for wanting to do the show.

In the last decade, the actor has been a part of films like Housefull 2, Hate Story 3 and 1921. In recent years, she’s also acted in films in Punjabi (Daaka, Jatt James Bond) and Telugu (Chankaya). “These 10 years have been a roller coaster ride. If it wasn’t for Salman, I don’t think I would have been here because becoming an actor was never my dream. In the beginning, I was like a lost child who had no idea how to go about things and I didn’t have anyone to guide me. There have been lots of ups and downs, lots of learning experiences and struggles.”

When she doesn’t have movies on her mind, Khan dreams of travelling through Northeast India, the Scottish Highlands, Egypt and Italy. “Australia is another country on my wishlist. Over the years, I have planned many work and personal trips, but they have never panned out.”

Jeep Bollywood Trails premières on January 25 and will air every Saturday at 8 pm on AXN.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/vehi7d/article30642327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Zareen-KhanJeep-Bollywood-TrailsAXN1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/zareen-khan-is-bollywoods-first-tour-guide-with-jeep-bollywood-trails/article30642328.ece
47,2020/01/24,"Vir Das on his new Netflix special, ‘For India’: Time to come home","Vir Das is a multi-hyphenate in the true sense of the word. In the last year or so, the 40-year-old has featured in an American network drama (Whiskey Cavalier); created and shot a desi travel comedy show; written, produced and acted in a web series about a comedian serial killer; toured the world; and shot a special. After Abroad Understanding and Losing It, Vir Das: For India is his third for Netflix. Calling it a “love letter” to India, he says, “The first one was a crossover special so it was shot in partly in Delhi and in New York. The second one was shot in San Francisco in a big comedy venue as if to say ‘I think I might have crossed over’. With this one, I just felt like it was time to come home.”

While the special drops on January 26, this promises to be a big weekend for the Go Goa Gone actor for more than one reason. He and Preity Zinta will feature in the January 25 episode of the hit Amercian comedy, Fresh off the Boat. There has also been talk about a possible spin-off, tentatively titled Magic Motor Inn, with the two Indian actors in the lead. “I am very excited. I got to meet the fantastic cast and work with Preity Zinta. I am a gigantic fan. There are conversations about the spin-off, but it’s still early,” he says. For now, though, Das is going to be preparing for a hush-hush film project that he’ll start shooting for in April. Excerpts from a telephonic interview:

Through the special you talk about Indian identity through food, drinks, customs, and personalities…

The idea was to zero in on the universal Indian identity. I tried in the first month of writing, but then I figured out that I am never going to get it right. There are literally 1.3 billion different versions of India. So, I might have a disclosure at the beginning and say “This is my India, and I get that it’s probably going to be drastically different from your India, but I am going to talk about 55 things, and hopefully, you’ll identify with 40 of them”. Then, I had to figure out how to talk about both big and small things — from the political situation to Chyawanprash and Jallianwala Bagh to Amar Akbar Anthony.

Would it be fair to say that this is your most political special yet?

Most comedians in the US are moving away from the Trump joke. It is either not funny any more, or it’s just so done. It’s easy to write a joke that you know 50% of the audience will relate to — less by virtue of the joke and more because of what their political beliefs are. One of the best things I saw was a John Mulaney bit where he compared Trump to “a horse in a hospital”. It was genius. While it was still political, it made people laugh, regardless of their political leanings. That’s when I wondered if I can go from Jungle Book to Narendra Modi. So, in that sense, yes, this special is political. Also, we can’t talk about our country without talking about what’s happening.

Vir Das | Photo Credit: SUJIT JAISWAL

Your career over the last few years looks like this blur of specials and world tours. What have been the standouts?

I am not really a retrospective kind of guy. I am always thinking about what I am going to do next. I am able to produce content for other people and that’s exciting to me. I can be a creative director. We are developing a show that’s written and directed by women, and I am hoping to produce it this year.

How would you describe your social media personality?

I’m trying to be better and not feed the trolls. I am also very sentimental. There is no middle ground. So, it’s either posts with lots of hearts or it’s just me being salty.

Who do you follow?

I don’t follow too many people. On Twitter, I’ve been following the same news portals, famous comedians and science and technology websites that I started off with in the beginning. On Instagram, I only follow bulldog accounts and my wife. On Facebook, I have a private account with about 25-30 friends.

Where do you engage with fans?

After the first Netflix special, suddenly 18 to 25 became the largest demographic on my social media followers. And, all the kids on Instagram. I like engaging with them there. Younger fans are always the most enthusiastic ones.

What are you watching?

I am a documentary guy. Between all the platforms, they have resurrected the documentary industry. I just watched (Killer Inside:) The Mind of Aaron Hernandez. I also saw a really good one called Blue Bird, about a music café in Memphis, Tennessee, and what it meant to country music. Peaky Blinders is my guilty pleasure. And I’ll watch Jamtara this weekend.

48,2020/01/24,Shruti Haasan: 'My short film Devi hits you with its poignant depiction of women strength',"“Devi, is a first for me in many ways. It is releasing on March 8, International Women's Day, and there could not have been a better date chosen for the women-centric powerful movie,” says actor Shruti Haasan. In her decade-long acting career, this is her first ever short film.

""It is a different genre altogether and I am lucky to have shared the screen space for the first time with power house of talent like Kajol,"" said the 33-year-old daughter of Kamal Haasan and Sarika. She was in Madurai to inaugurate a jewellery showroom.

Directed by Priyanka Banerjee, the less-than-an-hour film has an all-female cast featuring Neha Dhupia, Neena Kulkarni, Mukta Barve, Sandhya Mhatre, Rama Joshi, Shinvani Raghuvanshi and Yashaswini Dayam. The story is about a situation that puts nine oppressed women together. Though they come from different walks of life, all of them are dealing with the strikingly same issue.

“It will hit you with its poignant depiction of women strength and how they support each other,” said Shruthi in a quick response to a question about her upcoming films. “I am very excited about it,” she added.

Unwilling to take further questions on the sidelines of the event, she however, said the film’s strong message of empowerment was something close to her heart, given the deep influence of her father on her from childhood. “My parents have always guided me and given me the freedom. I have never used their influence in anything,” she said. “It is my acting skills and talents that will help me to evolve and progress,” she added.

Shruthi Haasan has acted in many Kollywood and Bollywood films. She started her career in 2009 with Hindi film Luck co-starring Imran Khan and has been a part of Welcome Back, Ramaiya Vastavaiya, Dil Toh Bachchca Hai Ji and D-Day. She was last seen in Tamil movie Singam 3 and after a hiatus of almost two years is now set to make a comeback with Laabam with Vijay Setupati who plays the lead role of a social activist. It is slated for release later this year. Shruthi will also be seen in the lead in Ravi Teja’s Krack.

49,2020/01/24,"Chaso, as inspirer","Great works of art and literature, and great writers and thinkers, cannot be left to fend for themselves for too long. Because, it is not often that we really or fully understand them, and more, every age has the need to seek and create anew their relevance in order to draw sustenance from them.

Chaso or Chaaganti Somayajulu was recognised as a master of the modernist short story form in Telugu from the time his first stories were published in the early 1940s. It coincided with the rise of the Progressive literary movement in Telugu. He often said that he initially wrote his stories with an intention to set a model and demonstrate how a Marxist understanding of human beings and society, aiming at a society free from exploitation, creative human excellence and genuine social satisfaction and joy, could be expressed in realistic, modern short stories. Nevertheless, it was a rare instance of a writer emerging fully evolved at the very beginning.

Take any of his celebrated and popular stories like Vaayluleenam, Kumkudaaku, Parabrahmam, Yenduku Paarestaanu Naanna and Empu, or some of his less discussed but equally penetrative explorations into human nature like Chokka-Botchu Tuvvaala, Maatru Dharmam or Ponee Tinu, you find that in each of them he unravels a facet of life, a big canvas indeed. A new form every time. A distinctive creative and stylistic approach to each story

Visionary and a littérateur(top) Celebratory event to mark Chaso’s anniversary (left) Chaso By arrangement

Chaso wrote just about 45 stories — most of them just four or five pages long — over a period of five decades (1942-1980), long time gaps separating concentrated spells of writing. Almost all of his stories are rooted in the provincial rural and small town life of north Andhra — Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts. By being resolutely local, and clued to the specificities of his characters, their specific lingos, the landscape, and the changing socio-economic relations, his stories acquired a stunning universality. It is as if brevity itself enables this superabundance of signification and discovery in his stories.

Chaso has been celebrated as one of the principal figures who deepened and consolidated the lead given by Gurajada Appa Rao, the pioneer of modernism in Telugu literature, in establishing the short story form as a socially purposeful and progressive medium. Yet he always felt that his stories did not receive the kind of critical and interpretive examination and acclaim they richly deserved.

Chaso passed away of cancer in 1994. It was left to Chaganti Tulasi, Chaso’s daughter, and herself a remarkable short story writer, translator and critic, to take charge and promote the critical discussion on the relevance of Chaso and the kind of beacon light he could be to emerging writers. Tulasi launched an annual event in 1995 to observe Chaso’s birthday on January 17, titled very appropriately as Chaso Sphoorti (Chaso’s Inspiration) in Vizianagaram, the town where Chaso spent all his life. The event soon became an annual pilgrimage for lovers of Chaso’s stories and his admirers, An award to an emerging Telugu short story writer, a lecture or two on some aspect of Chaso’s stories by invited speakers, a reading of a story of Chaso (he always meant them to be read aloud) have been the main features of this event. There have been a couple of bigger seminars too. The annual Chaso lectures, his poems, annotations on his stories, and his literary correspondence with other leading lights of Telugu literary modernism (like Srirangam Narayanababu, Sri Sri, Arudra, Ronanaki Appalaswamy) have come out in book form.

Having tirelessly worked for creating greater awareness about the finer nuances of Chaso’s stories for 24 years, Tulasi decided to conclude it with a final one this year. The 25th Chaso Sphoorti meet was held last Friday in Vizianagaram. Three books – critical essays and opinions on Chaso, and a photo album on 25 years of the event were released on the occasion. A new volume of Chaso’s stories, some newly discovered, is in the offing.

“Chaso belongs to the whole world. I am sure his admirers and the Telugu literary world will continue to revisit his stories and take inspiration from the high standards he set for himself and the purpose and relevance of literature and the short story,” says Tulasi.

50,2020/01/24,Growing up Indian,"Growing up Indian meant shifting the party every time a festival came around — gyrating to the latest songs, devotional or inappropriately filmy, invoking whichever powers and beseeching whichever gods could miraculously get us more of the fabulous stuff each mum cooked up, pongal, biryani or barfi.

It meant sitting cross-legged, hands joined through the pandit’s incantations and squinting an eye open each time he stopped, hoping it was closer to prasaad-eating time. Soon, itching and snitching and squabbling among us kids prompted a stern bark from an elder —‘Shh, or go out!’ Go out? Go out? And miss the ladoos? Not likely.

Our noses were tracking devices. Come Navroze, we’d be swinging on the gate of the elderly Parsi couple who lived across the maidan. We’d cracked the system, assessing that our chances of being fed by them were the highest; they had diabetes and couldn’t eat as much as they cooked. Dhansak devoured, we’d leave their gate alone for the next year.

On our respective festival days, we’d scamper, freshly scrubbed and dressed, despatched by our mums from house to house, proudly balancing plates of snacks covered with crocheted napkins, often depleting the bounty long before it reached the destined neighbour’s house.

Eid turned us spiritual at lunchtime when the tiffins of biryani arrived, despite motherly spoil-sportedness: wash your hands. Who took all the chicken pieces? Wait, don’t eat like hyenas. Close your mouths and chew.

On Holi, our moms demonically insisted we starve, aka wash out every bit of purple from inside our nostrils before we sat to eat. Divine, that thandai mixed with silver oil paint that lined our teeth, sourced illegally by an older kid from the mechanics.

We’d sneak in with any bunch of Christmas carollers who happened by, lustily serenading the redness of Rudolph’s nose, in the hope some rose cookies would reward us.

We yelled ‘Asatoma-sadgamaya’ or ‘Hello-be-your-name’ with equal gusto, on whichever occasion demanded it. Our mums’ yellow dupattas doubled up as saris on Sarawati puja and shepherd’s ‘don’t-trip-on-my-headgear’ in Christmas skits. We sprained ankles, hopping in circles on one foot doing the bhangra, deafened ourselves to get up close in each Durga puja pandal, sported finger burns while making figures of eight with Diwali phuljhadis, smacked our sticks against unwary knuckles when impromptu dandiya parties lit up the nights.

No one complained, no one demanded our state, creed or surname before plying us with samosas, and no one grew up unIndian because of it.

51,2020/01/24,India growth slowdown temporary: IMF,"IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on Friday said growth slowdown in India appeared to be temporary and she expected the momentum to improve going ahead.

Speaking at the WEF 2020 here, she said the world appeared a better place in January 2020 compared to what it was when the IMF announced its World Economic Outlook in October 2019.

She said the factors driving this positive momentum included receding trade tensions after the U.S.-China first phase trade deal and synchronised tax cuts, among others.

She, however, said a growth rate of 3.3% was not fantastic for the world economy. “It is still sluggish growth. We want fiscal policies to be more aggressive and we want structural reforms and more dynamism,” said the MD of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/b1po17/article17378670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28BUDAVOSMEETING,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-growth-slowdown-temporary-imf/article30646911.ece
52,2020/01/24,Direct tax collections set to drop for first time in two decades,"India’s corporate and income tax collection for the current year is likely to fall for the first time in at least two decades, over half a dozen senior tax officials told Reuters, amid a sharp fall in economic growth and cut in corporate tax rates.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government was targetting direct tax collection of ₹13.5 lakh crore ($189 billion) for the year ending March 31, a 17% increase over the prior fiscal year.

However, a sharp decline in demand has stung businesses, forcing companies to cut investment and jobs, denting tax collections and prompting the government to forecast a 5% growth for this fiscal year — the slowest in 11 years.

The tax department had managed to collect only ₹7.3 lakh crore as of January 23, more than 5.5% below the amount collected by the same point last year, a senior tax official said.

After collecting taxes from companies in advance for the first three quarters, officials typically garner about 30-35% of annual direct taxes in the final three months, data from the past three years shows.

But eight senior tax officials interviewed by Reuters said despite their best efforts, direct tax collections this financial year were likely to fall below the ₹11.5 lakh crore collected in 2018-19.

“Forget the target. This will be the first time that we’ll see a fall in direct tax collection ever,” a tax official in New Delhi said.

He estimates that direct tax collections for this year could end up roughly 10% below fiscal 2019.

Direct taxes typically account for about 80% of the government’s projections for annual revenue, and the shortfall may leave the government needing to boost borrowing to meet expenditure commitments.

The tax officials also say that a surprise cut in headline corporate tax rate last year aimed at wooing manufacturers and boosting investment in Asia’s third-biggest economy is another key reason behind the sluggish tax collections.

“We’ll be very happy if we can even break even with what we collected last year,” said another senior tax official in the financial capital Mumbai, the biggest tax generator, accounting for about a third of revenues from direct taxes. “But given the state of the economy, I’m not too hopeful.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/phn5aq/article30646904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-BU-IT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/direct-tax-collections-set-to-drop-for-first-time-in-two-decades/article30646905.ece

54,2020/01/24,Indian Bank profit up despite provisions,"Public sector lender Indian Bank has posted a 62.42% increase in its standalone net profit for the third quarter ended December 2019 to ₹247.96 crore despite a surge in provisions.

“Earnings of Indian Bank remained good despite the recognition of a huge sum of ₹1,325 crore of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd. (DHFL) account as a non-performing asset (NPA) during the last quarter,” said Padmaja Chunduru, MD and CEO, Indian Bank.

“Also, a divergence provision of ₹200 crore has been made. The bank is well positioned and the results are in line with our expectations,” she said.

During the period under review, total income increased to ₹6,506 crore from ₹5,269 crore. Net interest income rose 14% to ₹1,955 crore while net revenue (net interest income plus other income) grew 38% to ₹2,994 crore. Net interest margin increased by three basis points (bps) and touched 2.91%.

Fresh slippages during the quarter stood at ₹2,138 crore while cash recovery was ₹350 crore.

NCLAT cases

Referring to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) cases, she said there were two-three big corporate loans amounting to about ₹800 crore. “We don’t know when they will come up,” she added.

Total business crossed the ₹4.50 lakh crore-mark with a growth rate of 12% over the corresponding year-ago period. “It is set to double in size by June 2020,” she said.

According to her, an increase of 12% year-on-year in business was propelled by good growth, both in deposits and advances. Corporate advances accounted for 36% and retail advances at 64% of the total disbursements.

She hoped the momentum in corporate sector growth would happen during the fourth quarter and they were signs of early green shoots. Regarding amalgamation with Allahabad Bank, she said the process was on and all activities were being followed as per expected timelines.“We are sanguine that this would be a seamless integration resulting in good synergy for the bank and offer improved products and services for the customers,” she said.

Domestic CASA deposits recorded 10% growth and its share stood at 34.51% of total deposits as on December 2019 against 35.73%, mainly on account of term deposits outgrowing CASA.

58,2020/01/24,SC stays NCLAT order in Tata case,"The Supreme Court stayed an order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) rejecting a plea by the Registrar of Companies (RoC), Mumbai, to delete some adverse comments made against it for “converting” Tata Sons Private Limited (TSPL) into a ‘private company.’

A bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde stayed the January 6 order of the NCLAT and issued a formal notice. The court had recently stayed a December 18, 2019 judgment of the NCLAT reinstating Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons’ chairman.

The current petition concerning the RoC also emanates from the same December 18 verdict. The NCLAT had made scathing comments in the judgment about the RoC for altering the certificate of incorporation to facilitate the “purported conversion” of Tata Sons from a public entity to a private company on August 6, 2018. The comments in the verdict prompted the RoC to move the NCLAT, saying they were made in a litigation process in which the RoC was neither made a party nor heard. The RoC’s application was dismissed by the tribunal, leading TSPL to move the apex court.

For one, TSPL, represented by senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, said the January 6 order, instead of correcting the errors made in the December 18 verdict, amplifies and justifies the adverse comments against the RoC. Fresh conclusions are drawn by the NCLAT against the RoC. TSPL described the January 6 order as a “fatal anomaly.”

Contending on the merits of the January 6 order, TSPL said the tribunal reached an “anomalous and absurd” conclusion that there cannot be a private limited company since the minimum paid-up capital had not been prescribed by the Centre.

TSPL said the absence of any requirement for a minimum paid-up share capital only proves that there is no such need for the purposes of constituting a private limited company under the Companies Act of 2013.

TSPL also said post the coming into effect of the Companies (Amendment) Act of 2000, power has been conferred on the RoC to “effect changes and alterations in the Certificate of Incorporation in a case where a deemed public limited company became a private limited company by operation of law.” Lastly, TSPL is a de jure private company and requires no amendment to its articles/memorandum which would have the effect of converting into a private limited company.

“In other words, since the appellant (TSPL) is already a private limited company, it does not need to re-convert into a private company in terms of the procedure under Sections 14 and 18 of the 2013 Act,” TSPL contended in the Supreme Court.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/oxj1s7/article30646522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THBUSUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sc-stays-nclat-order-in-tata-case/article30646523.ece
59,2020/01/24,"Monetary policy has its limits, reforms must continue: Das","Though recognising the signs of an economic slowdown and acting early helped the central bank to reduce interest rate as falling inflation provided space, monetary policy has its own limits, Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das said on Friday.

Speaking at the St. Stephen’s College, his alma mater, on ‘Seven Ages of India’s Monetary Policy’, Mr. Das said structural reforms and fiscal measures may have to be continued and further activated to provide a durable push to demand and boost growth.

He said inflation had fallen successively and averaged below 4% since 2017-18, though there was a recent up-tick driven by food prices, especially the sharp increase in vegetable prices, reflecting the adverse impact of unseasonal rains and cyclone.

Since 2016, the RBI follows a flexible inflation targeting framework defined by a target of 4% for consumer price headline inflation, with a tolerance band of +/- 2% around it.

The central bank’s primary objective is price stability, while keeping in mind the objective of growth, as defined by the RBI Act.

The RBI Governor said there were some potential growth drivers which, through backward and forward linkages, could give a significant push to growth.

“Some of these areas include prioritising food processing industries, tourism, e-commerce, start-ups and efforts to become a part of the global value chain,” he said, adding that the government was also focussing on infrastructure spending which would augment the growth potential of the economy. Financial stability had emerged as another key consideration for monetary policy, “though jury is still out as to whether it should be added as an explicit objective,” Mr. Das said.

“It is interesting to note that the central banking function as the lender of last resort (LOLR) has remained intact, notwithstanding the developments and refinements in the policy frameworks across countries, including India,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/nnqohg/article30506488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08THBUDAS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/monetary-policy-has-its-limits-reforms-must-continue-das/article30646516.ece
60,2020/01/24,Gujarat High Court holds IGST on ocean freight ‘ultra vires’,"The High Court of Gujarat has declared the imposition of integrated goods and services tax (IGST) on ocean freight as ultra vires and held that such a levy was not permissible under the law.

The landmark judgment has brought about major relief to the importing community as this tax was mired in controversies leading to its challenge before the high court.

The court has junked two notifications levying the tax on the ground that they lacked “legislative competence” and held that no tax was leviable under the law.

“We have reached the conclusion that no tax is leviable under the integrated goods and services tax (IGST) Act 2017 on ocean freight for the services provided by a person located in a non-taxable territory by way of transportation of goods by a vessel from a place outside India up to customs station of clearance in India and the levy and collection of tax of such ocean freight under the impugned notification is not permissible in law,” stated the bench headed by Justice J.B. Pardiwala.

The petition, challenging the Centre’s notification, was moved by coal importers who submitted IGST can be levied either on the service provider or service recipient, not on the importers who pay customs duty.

Double taxation

They also submitted that IGST on ocean freight amounted to double taxation and hence, unconstitutional.

Welcoming the High Court’s verdict, Abhishek Jain, tax partner, EY said: “This ruling fortifies the no-tax position adopted by various businesses, especially those engaged in supplies of GST- excluded and exempt goods, to whom the credit of GST paid on the said ocean freight is clearly not available. This ruling has been a matter of consideration for the GST Council as well and an explicit clarification on this aspect from the government should help end the ongoing litigation in various States on this aspect.”

Explaining the judgment, G. Natarajan, advocate and senior partner of Swamy Associates, stated that in case of CIF (cost, insurance and freight) imports, the ocean freight is not paid by the Indian importer, but by the foreign exporter. The service is also provided by a foreign shipping line. In such a case, demanding service tax/GST for such transportation from the Indian importer is held to be extra-territorial and impermissible. Though this levy was introduced to create a level-playing field to the Indian shipping lines, the levy has been drafted so poorly, that it cannot withstand the judicial scrutiny.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cx5pcm/article30646513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THBUOCEAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/gujarat-high-court-holds-igst-on-ocean-freight-ultra-vires/article30646514.ece

“The acquisition of one of the leading providers of electrical and electronic equipment for infrastructure, power generation, transmission and distribution, will strengthen Siemens’ position as a key supplier of low-voltage power distribution and electrical installation technology in one of the world’s fastest-growing economies,” said the company in a statement.

Under the agreement, Siemens Ltd. will acquire approximately 99% of the equity share capital of C&S Electric Limited for around €267 million (₹2,100 crore).

Cedrik Neike, member of the managing board, Siemens AG and CEO, Smart Infrastructure, said: “Joining forces with C&S Electric allows us to bring a more comprehensive portfolio that addresses the needs of a very important market. This latest investment demonstrates our commitment to strengthening our offering in high growth markets in Asia.” The scope of the acquisition comprises the Indian operations of C&S Electric’s low-voltage switchgear components and panels, low and medium voltage power busbars as well as protection and metering devices businesses.

Other businesses of the company such as medium voltage switchgear and package sub-station, lighting, diesel generating sets, EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) and the Eta-com busbars business will be retained by the owners.

Sunil Mathur, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Siemens Ltd., said: “The addition of C&S Electric’s products, sales network, manufacturing units and a highly competent employee base will complement and strengthen the range of Siemens’ offering. This will bolster our portfolio not only in India, but also for export to competitive international markets in line with our growth strategy.”

In the future, Siemens envisions this partnership to pave the way for the establishment of a design and manufacturing hub in India, supporting the export of electrification solutions to fast-developing markets around the world.

C&S Electric has more than 50 years of experience in India and will continue to operate under its own brand name. The combination of the portfolios of the two companies will enhance Siemens position in the business, enabling it to better serve customers requiring electrification in areas including construction, industry, data centers, smart campuses and other city infrastructure.

R. N. Khanna, Founder and Chairman, C&S Electric, said: “Having been a leading participant in the Indian switchgear market since 1966, we are now extremely delighted to be part of the Siemens family, an organization that has pioneered and developed the switchgear market in India and globally for many decades.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/qurho4/article30646506.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THBUSIEMENS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/siemens-to-buy-cs-electric-for2100-crore/article30646507.ece
62,2020/01/24,Patanjali group eyes ₹25k crore turnover in FY20,"Haridwar-based Patanjali group, which has acquired debt-ridden Ruchi Soya, is expecting ₹25,000 crore turnover this fiscal, and aims to become the country’s largest FMCG company in coming years, Yoga Guru Ramdev said on Friday.

The company will register a joint turnover of ₹25,000 crore in the current fiscal ending March 2020, in which around ₹12,000 crore would be contributed by Patanjali group firms and ₹13,000 crore will come from Ruchi Soya, he said.

“In next five years, we would have a turnover of around ₹50,000 crore to ₹1 lakh crore and will become the largest FMCG company, replacing HUL,” Mr. Ramdev said.

Patanjali, which acquired Ruchi Soya in an Corporate Insolvency Resolution for around ₹4,500 crore, is also looking to expand its product line.

“We will launch three new products under Nutrela brand targeting the health conscious people, targeting the people suffering from diseases such as heart, cholesterol and high blood pressure,” he said.

These products will include premium Oil Nutrela Gold, Nutrela Honey and Nutrela Protein Atta.

“We are expecting three times growth from Ruchi Soya in coming year,” Ramdev said, adding it will also lessen burden of import of edible oil from other countries and make India self dependent in this sector.

Patanjali will also continue to have Bollywood actress Madhuri Dixit as the brand ambassador for Ruchi Soya’s Mahakosh range of products.

HUL, a market leader in the FMCG segment had reported a revenue of over ₹ 38,000 crore in FY 2018-19 and this is expected to go up further with the merger with GSK Healthcare business.

Ramdev also said that over the next two years, 25% shares of Ruchi Soya will have to be liquidated as per Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) guidelines.

64,2020/01/24,Slain terrorist identified as ‘most wanted’ JeM member,"The terrorist killed in a gunfight with security forces in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday has been identified as a Pakistani national affiliated to the proscribed Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a senior police officer said on Friday.

The “most wanted” terrorist had been operating under the code names, Abu Saifullah and Abu Qasim, and active in the militancy-infested south Kashmir for the past one-and-a-half years, he said. Saifullah was wanted for the abduction and killing of two civilians and threatening special police officers (SPOs) and non-local labourers.

A close associate of JeM chief commander Qari Yasir of Pakistan, who was killed in an encounter with security forces in Kupwara district in July 2013, Saifullah was trapped with his local associate at Zaintrag in the Awantipora area on Tuesday morning, he said.

The search operation turned into a gunfight when the terrorists opened fire at the parties of the police, 50 Rashtriya Rifles and 185 Battalion of the CRPF, the officer said. The heavy firing resulted in grievous injuries to Sepoy Rahul Ranswal of Rashtriya Rifles and SPO Shahbaz Ahmad of the police, who were evacuated to the Army’s 92 Base Hospital in Srinagar. Both died there, he said.

While the injured jawans were evacuated, the terrorists escaped. They were tracked down the next day in the nearby forest area of Nagander.

65,2020/01/24,"Nirbhaya case: Tihar authorities delaying in handing over documents, convicts tell court","An advocate appearing for three of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case moved a Delhi court on Friday alleging that the Tihar jail authorities are not handing over certain documents and this is causing delay in filing their mercy and curative petitions.

A. P. Singh moved an application alleging that the jail authorities are yet to give the documents which are required to file the mercy petition for Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and curative petitions for Akshay Kumar Singh (31) and Pawan Singh (25).

The plea is likely to be taken up for hearing on Saturday.

The Supreme court recently dismissed the curative petitions of other two convicts -- Vinay and Mukesh Singh (32).

Mukesh’s mercy petition was rejected by the President earlier this month. The hanging of all four is to take place on February 1 at 6 am according to the court order.

In his petition, the lawyer said he had expressed “an urgent will to file a mercy petition before the relevant authorities and undertook several steps to obtain relevant information to file it“.

He said Vinay wanted to attach his personal diary containing 70 pages with the mercy petition and had asked the jail authorities to provide.

However, the diary is yet to be provided and because of this the plea could not be filed, he said.

The counsel said he had also sought some documents of convicts Pawan and Akshay which have not been provided.

The petition sought a direction to jail authorities to provide the documents on “an urgent basis“.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/samxnd/article30646874.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THNIRBHAYAFINAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-case-tihar-authorities-delaying-in-handing-over-documents-convicts-tell-court/article30646875.ece
66,2020/01/24,"TNQ Distinguished Lectures: Indian scientists must try to work on interesting subjects, says Nobel Laureate Venki Ramakrishnan","Young scientists in India should work on doing “important and interesting” science and it was possible to be based in India and do ground-breaking work without “lowering the level” of the science attempted, Nobel Laureate and President of the Royal Society Venkatraman ‘Venki’ Ramakrishnan, said at a lecture here.

His talk, ‘My Adventures in the Ribosome’ was delivered as part of the 10th edition of the TNQ Distinguished Lectures in the Life Sciences 2020. “There are a wealth of problems considering the biodiversity of India that need investigation,” he said.

His address focused on his contribution to the role of deciphering the structure of the ribosome. This is the biological machinery necessary to transform the genetic code, which is stored as DNA, into proteins that go on to make up our bodies and sustain its processes.

Dr. Ramakrishnan referenced heavily from his memoir, The Gene Machine, to narrate personal anecdotes: about switching from physics to biology as a graduate student because he intuited that he'd likely be able to make a significant contribution, as well as reflect on the practice of science saying, “Scientists are neither Spocks nor saints”. He added that the “Nobel is mistaken for greatness.”

The Nobel laureate dwelt on the rivalry among scientists around the world to decipher the structure of the ribosome. Groups in Israel and at Yale University, at various points, appeared to have a lead on his group. So he took the “risky” step of moving to a new country — the United Kingdom — and taking a 40% pay cut. However, the decision paid off as he was able to solve the structure of the ribosome and was instrumental in bringing to a wider audience the significance, Dr Ramakrishnan said.

Dr. Ramakrishnan took questions from the audience on the practice of science, origins of the ribosome and its role in the origin of life, his ways of coping with failure, at the talk at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The audience consisted of scientists, students, research scholars, K VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Advisor (who also introduced Dr. Ramakrishnan) and Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology and Randeep Guleria, Director, AIIMS.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/55ng4i/article30646857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THVENKIRAMAKRISHNAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-scientists-must-try-to-work-on-interesting-subjects/article30646858.ece
67,2020/01/24,CJI Bobde calls for speedy resolution of cases,"Lower pendency of cases inspires public faith in the judiciary, and the use of technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), in the judicial work can help in speedy justice, but it can never replace human discretion in just decision-making, Chief Justice of India (CJI) S.A. Bobde said on Friday.

Speaking at the 79th foundation day of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), he said that while tax evasion was injustice to fellow Indian citizens, arbitrary or excessive taxation resulted in social injustice by a government.

He said speedy resolution of tax disputes would act as an incentive to taxpayers and free the funds locked in litigation. “A just and speedy dispute resolution is perceived as a tax incentive by the taxpayer. To the tax collector, an efficient tax judiciary assures that demands arising out of legitimate assessment are not strangled in delayed litigation,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dz970p/article30646806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THBOBDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cji-bobde-calls-for-speedy-resolution-of-cases/article30646807.ece
68,2020/01/24,Centre seeks to revamp child care scheme in urban areas,"Urban areas are likely to receive a renewed focus under the government’s ICDS programme, which provides for anganwadis or day-care centres across the country for delivery of nutrition and pre-school education.

The government’s think tank, the NITI Aayog, has prepared a draft working paper, which once approved would be circulated to different ministries for consultations. These include the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, the Ministry of Urban Housing and Affairs and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation.

“Health and ICDS models that work in rural areas may not work in urban areas because of higher population density, transportation challenges and migration,” a government official familiar with the deliberations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Hindu.

‘Other models’

“Because of these issues it may not be possible for a community worker to keep in contact with the beneficiaries, which she is able to achieve in rural settings. We have seen some models in India, and in other countries and we are trying to synthesize learnings from those,” the official added.

According to government data from 2018, of the 14 lakh anganwadis across the country there are only 1.38 lakh anganwadis in urban areas. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) provide for anganwadis or day-care centres which deliver a package of six services including supplementary nutrition, pre-school non-formal education, nutrition and health education, immunisation, health check-up and referral services to hospitals.

Urban challenges

The first-ever pan-India survey on the nutrition status of children, highlighted that malnutrition among children in urban India is characterised by relatively poor levels of breastfeeding as mothers have to travel long distances for work. It also found a higher prevalence of obesity because of relative prosperity and lifestyle patterns, along with iron and Vitamin D deficiency. Children in rural parts on the other hand suffered from higher levels of stunting, were more underweight, and wasting and the lower consumption of milk products were more prevalent.

Children in urban areas were overweight and obese as indicated by subscapular skinfold thickness (SSFT) for their age. While 14.5% of children in the age group of 5 to 9 years in cities had higher SSFT, than 5.3% in rural areas, 10.4% of adolescents surveyed in urban areas in the age group of 10-19 had higher SSFT, than 4.3% in rural areas

Avani Kapur, a policy researcher, said improving infrastructure in urban areas would be key as the government embarks on improving service delivery under the ICDS programme.

“One thing which will be crucial for anganwadi services in urban areas is strengthening safety and infrastructure,” said Ms. Kapur, Director at Accountability Initiative of the Centre for Policy Research.

“The other critical thing that needs some serious thinking with respect to ICDS strengthening is the role we expect from the anganwadi centre (AWC) and workers. With talk on merging the pre-school education component with schools in some States — we need to re-imagine their role. Nutrition is one part but we should not forget the support that the AWC provides to the community as a safe place where kids can be left and services availed,” she added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hnz8bq/article30646762.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THANGANWADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-seeks-to-revamp-child-care-scheme-in-urban-areas/article30646763.ece

Among them, seven persons who displayed mild influenza-like symptoms have been isolated in various medical colleges as part of the general precautionary measures. The rest have been advised home quarantine, and to alert the local health administration in the event of any symptom like fever. We will be following them up.”

The WHO has maintained that the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) spread was not a global health emergency, but is an emergency in China. “In India, we have increased our preparedness, and till Friday, no cases have been detected,” said a senior health official.

Across India as on January 24, 20,844 passengers from 96 flights have been screened, and on Friday 4082 passengers of 19 flights were screened.

72,2020/01/24,Sugarcane farmers flag Brazil’s case against India in WTO,"Several farmers groups have demanded that the government push Brazil to withdraw its complaint against India’s sugar pricing policies at the World Trade Organisation. The demand comes just ahead of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s arrival in Delhi on Friday as chief guest of the Republic Day celebrations.

Brazil has said it is open to finding a “non-litiguous solution” to the dispute, adding that the issue would not affect bilateral collaborations on biofuels derived from sugarcane.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Indian Coordination Committee of Farmers Movements (ICCFM) noted that “the Brazilian government, under the leadership of Mr. Bolsonaro is directly threatening the livelihoods of five crore Indian sugarcane farmers” by challenging the minimum price for sugarcane set by the Indian government.

“The irony of the whole situation is that the Indian government only announces Fair and Remunerative Prices (FRP) to be paid by the sugar mills to farmers,” said General Secretary of the Bhartiya Kisan Union Yudhvir Singh, who is also convenor of the ICCFM.

74,2020/01/24,154 ‘concerned citizens’ petition President against violence during anti-CAA protests,"A group of 154 “concerned citizens”, including retired judges and bureaucrats, on Friday petitioned President Ram Nath Kovind against the violence during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The citizens’ delegation, led by Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) Chairman and former Chief Justice of the Sikkim High Court Permod Kohli, handed over a memorandum Mr. Kovind, appealing to him to “safeguard” the country's democratic institutions.

The memorandum stated that the “conscious, responsible and concerned citizens want the Centre to look into the matter with all seriousness and safeguard the democratic institutions of the country and take stern action against such forces”.

It said, “Whenever India faced challenges on its borders and encountered the onslaught of some of the foreign invaders, it was more because of internal chicanery of individuals and small groups of people for their personal agendas and benefits who have from time to time tried to break the fabric of India's unity and cohesiveness. We are seeing this phenomenon again.”

The group alleged that the protests, “while ostensibly claiming to oppose the policies of the Centre”, are designed to “destroy the fabric of India and threaten its unity and integrity”.

The memorandum said, “The fear-mongering, which is being spread across the length and breadth of India, appears to be motivated and with a sinister design to harm the nation. The CAA does not impact on Indian citizens and hence claims that a citizen's rights and liberties are being infringed, does not stand scrutiny”.

The signatories to the memorandum include 11 former High Court judges, 72 ex-bureaucrats, including former ambassadors, 56 former defence officers and other public spirited individuals.

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he released to the press, Mr. Viswam said he was anguished to know that Mr. Bolsonaro would be the Chief Guest of the Republic Day parade despite the fact that the President had sought sanctions against India at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) for coming to the aid of its sugarcane farmers.

“It is astonishing that you have welcomed a leader whose ideology and policies are tarnished by bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, and discrimination,” Mr Viswam said in his letter. President Bolsonaro's actions were directly in conflict with ethos of the Indian Constitution, he alleged.

“President Bolsonaro’s apathy and inaction for over two months when the Amazon rainforest was burning has caused irreparable damage to the global environment and as a country committed towards addressing climate change India must condemn him for those actions,” he wrote.

Mr. Viswam said it was sad that the government had forgotten President Bolsonaro's demand at the WTO. “His actions are a direct threat to the livelihood of over 5 crore sugarcane farming families in India and your invitation to him signals a complete disregard for your own citizens and their plight.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/f2bw3m/article30645576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25BINOYVISWAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cpi-mp-binoy-viswam-to-boycot-r-day-parade/article30645577.ece

Addressing a press conference at the party headquarters, Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev said “this is the real face of the government which is watching your eating habits”.

“We condemn the statement made by Vijayvargiya ji. He has connected the food of the construction worker to his nationality and called them the infiltrators,” said Ms. Dev.

“If a responsible senior leader of the BJP like Mr. Vijayvargiya can today declare someone as a foreign infiltrator because he or she is having ‘poha’ as is being reported, you can profile a census on nationality and connect it to national security. This is the reason why we are saying that this Government will use the National Population Register (NPR) for profiling people,” she added.

“This is the way we suspect the government will conduct the NPR [survey] to do profiling on the basis of religion, on the basis of community, on the basis of language and now even food.”

The controversy erupted after Mr. Vijayvargiya claimed that he suspected that the labourers who had been engaged for construction work at his Indore house could be Bangladeshis as they had ‘strange’ eating habits.

A three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra, examining the review plea in chambers on Thursday, saw the review fit to be heard in open court.

The apex court verdict under review is one delivered on October 1 last by a Bench of then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose. It directed a Nagpur court to continue with the trial against Mr. Fadnavis under Section125-A of the Representation of the People (RP) Act, 1951.

The decision had come in an appeal filed by Satish Ukey, a lawyer, against a Bombay High Court decision. The High Court had set aside a Sessions Court go-ahead to try Mr. Fadnavis for violation of the RP Act.

The judgment by Chief Justice Gogoi held that a “contesting candidate is mandated to furnish information concerning the cases in which a Competent Court has taken cognisance along with the cases in which charges have been framed”.

The apex court interpreted Section 33-A of the 1951 Act to hold that “information” to be disclosed by a candidate includes cases of which a court had taken cognisance.

The court held that the election affidavit under Form 26 of the Conduct of Election Rules of 1961, submitted to the poll officer along with the nomination papers, should have details of not only cases in which charges have been filed but also of those which have been taken cognisance too.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ta225a/article30645270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DevendraFadnavis-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-hear-in-open-court-fadnavis-review-plea-in-poll-case/article30645262.ece

As many as 1,789 passengers underwent thermal screening at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport for the contagion since January 19 and two of them, who had travelled to China, were admitted to the civic-run Kasturba Hospital in the city as a precaution, they said.

Till now, no cases of coronavirus infection have been detected during screening, a Health Department official said. “No passenger with history of visit to Wuhan city of China in the last 14 days was found positive (for the virus) during thermal scanning,” he said.

Ground zero

Coronavirus cases were first reported from Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei Province. In the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in China, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has created an isolation ward at the Kasturba Hospital. “The isolation ward has been created for diagnosis and treatment of persons suspected to have the viral infection,” said Dr. Padmaja Keskar, executive health officer of the BMC.

Dr. Keskar said the two persons under observation at the hospital have mild cough and exhibited cold-related symptoms. Doctors at the Mumbai international airport have been asked to send travellers returning from China to the isolation ward if they show any symptoms of the novel coronavirus, she said.

City-wide observation

“All private doctors in the city have been asked to alert us if they observe symptoms of coronavirus in any person who has returned from China,” she added.

According to sources in the Kasturba Hospital, they have received detailed instructions from the Maharashtra government about how to deal with a coronavirus infection. Apart from the hopital, quarantine facilities have also been provided at Naidu Hospital in Pune, the officials added.

The coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus that has killed people in China is a novel strain and was not seen before. Common symptoms of the infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, according to the World Health Organisation.

Measures in place

Dr. Pradeep Awate, surveillance officer with the State Health Department, said cases of coronavirus infection have been detected mainly in China, and a few cases have been found in other countries including South Korea, Japan, Thailand and the United States.

During screening at the Mumbai airport, six passengers — three each from Mumbai and Pune — underwent further medical examination, he said. “Four of them were found to be perfectly alright. As a precaution, two others who were suffering from a minor cold and cough have been admitted to the Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai and kept under monitoring,” Dr. Awate said.

Authorities would be following up with every passenger who has returned from any of the countries where outbreak of coronavirus has been reported for the next 28 days to check if she or he has developed symptoms of the infection, he added. He appealed people not to panic as no case of coronavirus infection has been found in the country yet.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7co414/article30644936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINCORONAVIRUS-24jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-two-returnees-from-china-under-quarantine-in-mumbai/article30644890.ece
79,2020/01/24,IMF chief calls India’s growth slowdown temporary,"IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva on Friday said growth slowdown in India appears to be temporary and that she expects the momentum to improve going ahead.

The world appears a better place in January 2020 compared to what it was when IMF announced its World Economic Outlook in October 2019, she said at the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2020 here.

She said the factors driving this positive momentum include receding trade tension after the U.S.-China first phase trade deal and synchronised tax cuts, among others.

She, however, said 3.3% is not a fantastic growth rate for the world economy.

“It is still sluggish growth. We want fiscal policies to be more aggressive and we want structural reforms and more dynamism,” the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said.

On Monday, the IMF lowered growth estimate for the world economy to 2.9% for 2019, citing “negative surprises” in few emerging market economies, especially India.

The IMF also revised downwards its forecast for India to 4.8% for 2019-20.

Regarding emerging markets, Ms. Georgieva on Friday said they are also moving forward.

“We had a downgrade in one large market—India—but we believe that’s temporary. We expect momentum to improve further going ahead. There are also some bright spots like Indonesia and Vietnam,” she noted.

According to her, a number of African countries are doing very well, but some other nations like Mexico are not.

On risks ahead for the global economy, the IMF chief listed factors like weakness in long-term productivity growth and low inflation.

“We are living in a more risk-prone world. It is only January and there have been events that are sparking risks for the global economy,” she added.

Releasing an update to its World Economic Outlook (WEO) on Monday, the IMF had said global growth, estimated at 2.9% in 2019, is projected to increase to 3.3% in 2020 and inch up further to 3.4% in 2021.

Compared to the October WEO forecast, the estimate for 2019 and the projection for 2020 represent 0.1% reduction for each year while that for 2021 is 0.2% lower.

“A more subdued growth forecast for India... accounts for the lion’s share of the downward revisions,” it had said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nlw5ql/article30644875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THKRISTALINAGEORGIEVA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/imf-chief-calls-indias-growth-slowdown-temporary/article30644876.ece
80,2020/01/24,The poha eaters: BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya’s remark stirs Twitter storm,"BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya has attracted a torrent of criticism on social media, particularly in West Bengal, after his comments about the eating habits of labourers.

On January 23, Mr. Vijayvargiya said that he had suspected that there were some Bangladeshis among the construction labourers who had been working at his house after he had found them eating poha (flattened rice that is called chire in Bengal). Chire, a staple food among Bengalis, is consumed across the country, and the BJP leader’s remarks triggered a sharp reaction on Twitter on January 24.

“My dhobi [washerman] showed up eating a burger. I think he’s American,” tweeted a social media user named Kajol Srinivasan.

Speaking at a meeting in Indore to express support for the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Mr. Vijayvargiya said that some of the labourers working in his house had been eating only poha and that he had found this behaviour “strange” and therefore suspected them to be “Bangladeshis”.

“I suspected these workers were residents of Bangladesh. Two days after I became suspicious, they stopped working at my house. I have not filed any police complaint yet. I only mentioned this incident to warn people,” he was quoted as having said.

Following the comment, Twitter users reacted with a combination of outrage and sarcasm. “I literally eat only poha for breakfast. Guess I’m Bangladeshi too,” tweeted Anshul, another Twitter user. Many remarked that the BJP appeared to have extended their campaign against select foods to include flattened rice after having initially started by targeting “beef”.

“Those who are excited about the comment on chire today, [do] remember that it all started with beef,” commented an activist Sumaan Sengupta. Others asserted that Mr. Vijayvargiya had “no idea” about the breakfast staples of the working class in the country as poha was consumed everywhere — from east to west, north to south.

“If not poha, what else you expect labourers to bring with them — butter chicken?” tweeted Ravinder Singh.

81,2020/01/24,Delhi High Court asks JNU to register students as per old hostel manual,"In a relief for students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), who have been on strike for three months over hike in hostel fees, the Delhi High Court on Friday asked the varsity to register students for the new academic session as per the old hostel manual.

While directing JNU not to charge any late fee, Justice Rajiv Shakdar said those who have not yet registered could do so within one week

The court remarked that since 90 per cent of the students had registered, “the remaining 10 per cent students are concerned, they need to register within one week as per the old manual. No late fee will be charged from them”.

The order came while hearing a plea by Jawaharlal Nehru University Student Union (JNUSU)challenging the Inter Hostel Administration (IHA) decision amending the Hostel Manual which, amongst other issues, increased the hostel fee.

The court additionally sought a response from the varsity on the petition. It also made the Central government and the University Grants Commission (UGC), a party to the case. It posted the case for further hearing on February 28.

During the hearing, senior advocate Akhil Sibal, appearing for the JNUSU, argued that the old hostel manual was altered without consulting the representatives of the student body. He claimed that some of the students had paid the hiked fee in fear.

Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand said the services and utility charges were waived by the UGC as per a Jan 9, 2020 circular.

The petition filed by JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh sought the quashing of the minutes of the 283rd Meeting of the Executive Council (EC) held on November 13 last year ratifying the IHA decision and the High level committee of November 25, 2019, making further amendments to the Hostel Manual.

The petition said, the “decisions are mala fide, arbitrary and illegal and adversely affect the student community of the University bringing far reaching changes to the provisions of the Hostel Manual”.

The amendments to the Hostel Manual include an increase in hostel fee, affects rights of those in reserved categories vis a vis allocation of hostel rooms and also reduces the representation of the JNUSU in the IHA, amongst several other changes.

The petition pointed out that the minutes of the IHA meeting also stated that mess services, sanitation services, room charges, amongst others category of charges would be increased by 10 per cent every academic year, i.e., from the Monsoon Semester.

The student union further contended that the IHA was held with no student representation, “defeating the mandate of the Hostel Manual of including the views of the stakeholders when changing the provisions of the Hostel Manual”.

Subsequent to the amendments, the JNUSU and Hostel Presidents wrote to the JNU administration on various occasions bringing to their attention the ‘illegalities’. “However, the University refused to take any action and in fact allowed the ratification of this illegal meeting,” the petition stated.

It had asked the court to quash the decisions of the IHA dated and to reconvene a fresh IHA as per law.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ezdvud/article30644521.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DelhiHC-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hc-asks-jnu-to-register-students-as-per-old-hostel-manual/article30644509.ece
82,2020/01/24,Can’t pass ‘blanket order’ against decision to place Delhi under National Security Act: Supreme Court,"The Supreme Court on Friday refused to pass a “blanket order” against Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s decision to place Delhi under the National Security Act (NSA), a law which allows the police to place anyone considered a threat to national security, law and order under preventive detention.

A Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra told petitioner-advocate Manohar Lal Sharma that the court cannot pass such general directions, which would “tie” the hands of the authorities.

The NSA was imposed from January 19 to April 18. The notification was issued on January 10 amidst widespread protests across the Capital by people belonging to all walks of life against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) of 2019, which grants citizenship on the basis of religion.

“These are law and order issues. How can we interfere? We cannot pass a general direction or a blanket order restraining the government from invoking NSA, but we can definitely do something if individual cases of misuse of NSA by authorities are brought to our attention,” Justice Mishra observed orally.

A court cannot direct the government to refrain from arresting anybody. “How can we do that? Withdraw the petition and we give you liberty to approach the court citing individual cases of misuse of NSA powers,” Justice Mishra said.

Mr. Sharma had submitted that the imposition of NSA was a ruse to scare ordinary people from expressing their fundamental right to dissent on issues like the CAA, the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register Citizens (NRC).

The lawyer argued that the January 10 notification was an affront to free speech and expression and the right to dignity. Mr. Sharma had, besides urging the court to quash the notification, sought a judicial direction to the government to pay compensation to those who were detained under the NSA for “mental agony, defamation in society and loss of reputation“.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/orto0/article30644279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cant-pass-blanket-order-against-decision-to-place-delhi-under-nsa-supreme-court/article30644261.ece
83,2020/01/24,Uber brings tipping feature for driver-partners in India,"Uber has introduced the in-app tipping in India to help its driver-partners increase their earnings from the platform, a feature that the ride-hailing platform had introduced in the U.S. over two years ago.

According to sources, the U.S.-based ride hailing platform started piloting the feature in India in Mumbai two months ago and has now rolled out across more than 50 cities.

The feature—currently available to riders paying through Paytm wallet—will be available for rides taken in cabs, autos and bikes (UberMoto) on the platform, they added.

One of the persons said during the pilot phase, it was found that riders had tipped ₹25 on average.

When contacted, Uber India South Asia head of city operations Prabhjeet Singh said: “Driver partners are at the heart of everything we do at Uber and we are always looking for opportunities to showcase both respect and greater appreciation for them“.

“Every year riders in India reward hundreds of thousands of driver partners with 5-star ratings. Uber’s new tipping feature now enables them to also say thanks to driver partners who deliver exceptional service,” he said in an e-mailed statement.

After the completion of a ride, passengers paying through Paytm wallet are given the option to tip the driver-partner. The four options shown are ₹25, 50, 100 and ‘enter custom amount’.

Driver-partners keep 100% of the tips for rides. Riders can go back to previous trips on the app to add a tip.

Ride-hailing platforms like Uber and Ola charge the driver-partner a commission on the trip fare, while offering certain incentives to drive for the platform. There have been reports of driver-partners quitting these platforms as incentives have dwindled over time.

Uber and its rival, Ola have pumped in millions of dollars into marketing and promotions, offering incentives for driver partners as well as subsidising trips for riders.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/je85ef/article30644226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THUBER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uber-brings-tipping-feature-for-driver-partners-in-india/article30644227.ece
84,2020/01/24,Maharashtra orders probe into ‘phone tapping’,"Maharahstra’s ruling coalition of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, have seized on allegations of phone tapping of senior party leaders by the previous government led by the BJP. However, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has denied the allegations.

The NCP has also alleged that the Koregaon-Bhima riot in Pune in 2018 was orchestrated in a bid to frame Dalit and Ambedkarite activists.

Accusing the previous BJP-led government in Maharashtra of tapping phones of senior NCP and Congress leaders during the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday said he had ordered a probe into the matter.

“The previous BJP-led government had tapped phones of senior NCP and Congress leaders through government mechanism ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls held last year,” Mr Deshmukh said on Friday while announcing the probe.

Pegasus spyware

“We have also ordered a probe into allegations that spyware Pegasus was used to snoop on officials and activists during the previous government’s rule. We will check which officers travelled to Israel during the period to allegedly procure this malware,” Mr. Deshmukh said.

A week ago, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had appealed to the State government to probe the involvement of an Israel-based company in alleged snooping on certain leaders.

Earlier on Thursday, Mr Deshmukh and Deputy CM Ajit Pawar held a review meeting with State’s senior police officials on the arrest of alleged ‘urban naxals’ in the Koregaon-Bhima case after NCP chief Sharad Pawar wrote a letter questioning the probe so far.

NCP leader and Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said the phone tapping episode shows the perverted mentality of the BJP. “I have also been questioning the arrests in Koregaon-Bhima riot in the State Assembly. It looked staged even then as only Dalit and Ambedkarite workers were targeted by probe agencies,” he said.

Speaking on the allegations, the Sena’s MP in the Rajya Sabha, Sanjay Raut, said, claimed that a BJP leader had informed him that his phone was being tapped by the previous Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra. “A BJP leader told me that my phone is being tapped in the previous government and I said I welcome it. I am a disciple of Balasaheb Thackeray. Whatever I do, I do it openly.”

Congress leader and Public Works Department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan said the BJP can stoop to any level to win power. “The only agenda of the BJP is to have uninterrupted power. BJP’s functioning in different States has shown that and therefore, the allegations cannot be discarded. A high-level probe monitored by Chief Minister has to be undertaken,” he said.

Fadnavis denial

Former chief minister and Leader of Opposition Fadnavis has denied the allegations. “Phone-tapping is not the culture of Maharashtra. My government had not given any such orders,” he said.

“The State government is free to probe the allegations with the help of any machinery. People of Maharashtra know the truth. A Shiv Sena leader was the Minister of State for Home during my tenure. I have a request — the government should immediately conduct an inquiry and make the report public. If it wants to go to Israel for the probe, it should do that,” he said.

Responding to Mr Fadnavis, Sena MLA Deepak Kesarkar, who was the Minister of State (Home) in the previous BJP-Sena government said the authority of an MoS is limited and he had no knowledge of such snooping.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/zigwjc/article30644138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THANILDESHMUKH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/anil-deshmukh-levels-phone-tapping-charges-against-previous-maharashtra-govt/article30644139.ece

The 10th edition of the dictionary, which was launched on Friday, has 384 Indian English words and incorporates over 1,000 new words such as chatbot, fake news and microplastic.

The dictionary focuses on language change and its evolution through the years, and has ensured that the language and examples used in the new edition are relevant and up to date with the times, Oxford University Press (OUP) said.

The new edition comes with interactive online support through the Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries website and an app. The website includes advanced features such as audio-video tutorials, video walkthroughs, self-study activities and enhanced iWriter and iSpeaker tools.

“This edition has 26 new Indian English words of which 22 figure in the printed dictionary. The other four are in the digital version,” said Fathima Dada, Managing Director (Education Division) at OUP.

Some of other new Indian words in the dictionary are auntie (while aunty already figures in the English dictionary, auntie is an Indianism), bus stand, deemed university, FIR, non-veg, redressal, tempo, tube light, veg and videograph.

The four new Indian English words in the online version of the dictionary are current (for electricity), looter, looting and upazila (one of the areas that a district is divided into for administration purposes).

According to OUP, the new edition provides better, more accurate and understandable definitions with examples, usage notes and additional resources to help the learner use the right word in the right context.

“Prevalence and common usage are the main criteria for enlisting new words. We scan the globe for words which are often used by people while speaking English. Then these words go through a rigorous testing process,” Dada said.

“As OUP is the custodian of English language globally, these words have to go through its processes,” she told PTI.

The Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, she said, has been reinventing itself for nearly eight decades, anticipating the growing learning requirements of learners.

“The 10th edition also is equipped with a strong digital support system, including an app,” she said.

It is equipped with several digital tools. With iSpeaker, learners can get help preparing for speaking exams and presentations. With iWriter, learners can plan, write and review their written work. Text Checker allows the teacher to check any text against the Oxford 3000, 5000, and OPAL (Oxford Phrasal Academic Lexicon) written word list.

Resources accessible through online premium access include lesson plans, worksheets, video walkthroughs, and classroom and self-study activities. With the OALD app one can find 86,000 words, 95,000 phrases, 112,000 meanings and 237,000 examples.

The dictionary, which spans 77 years, was originally published in Japan in 1942 and was first brought out by OUP in 1948. The learner’s dictionary is based on the original values of its creator, Albert Sydney Hornby, whose aim was to help language learners worldwide understand the meaning of English words.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ep18no/article30034219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/aadhaar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/aadhaar-dabba-hartal-shaadi-make-it-to-oxford-dictionary/article30643350.ece

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Mr. Soros said that the rise of nationalism across the globe was the great enemy of open society.

“The biggest and most frightening setback occurred in India where a democratically elected Narendra Modi is creating a Hindu nationalist state, imposing punitive measures on Kashmir, a semi-autonomous Muslim region, and threatening to deprive millions of Muslims of their citizenship,” he said.

87,2020/01/24,"Candidates with criminal past should not get ticket, Election Commission of India tells Supreme Court","The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine a proposition made by the Election Commission (EC) to ask political parties to not give ticket to those with criminal antecedents.

Appearing before a Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, senior advocate Vikas Singh said 46% of Members of Parliament have criminal records.

The Supreme Court’s long string of judgments against criminalisation of politics had hardly scratched the surface of the deep rot.

The Bench, also comprising Justice Ravindra S. Bhat, asked Mr. Singh and petitioner Ashwini Kumar Upadhyay’s lawyer, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, to put their heads together and come up with a joint proposal detailing how it can be ensured that parties did not fall in with criminal politicians.

Justice Nariman, speaking for the Bench, said just a move to steer politics away from the denizens of the criminal world would definitely serve national and public interest. The court gave the two senior lawyers a week’s time to come up with their proposal.

Mr. Singh said the EC had tried several measures to curb criminalisation of politics, but to no avail.

Mr. Upadhyay had filed a contempt petition seeking action against the authorities and parties for not complying fully with a September 2018 judgment of a Constitution Bench, which had directed political parties to publish online the pending criminal cases of their candidates.

‘Cleansing parties’

The judgment had urged Parliament to bring a “strong law” to cleanse political parties of leaders facing trial for serious crimes. The ruling by a five-judge Bench led by then Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra concluded that rapid criminalisation of politics cannot be arrested by merely disqualifying tainted legislators but should begin by “cleansing” the political parties.

The court had suggested that Parliament frame a law that makes it obligatory for political parties to remove leaders charged with “heinous and grievous” crimes like rape, murder and kidnapping, only to a name a few, and refuse ticket to offenders in both parliamentary and Assembly polls.

“The nation eagerly awaits for such a legislation,” the court had told Parliament. It had also issued guidelines, including that both the candidate and the political party should declare the criminal antecedents of the former in widely-circulated newspapers.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dhdzu8/article17029437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTIONCOMMISSION-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/candidates-with-criminal-past-should-not-get-ticket-election-commission-of-india-tells-supreme-court/article30641893.ece

89,2020/01/24,Centre refuses to give more funds to Kerala for flood relief,"The Centre will not allot any additional assistance to Kerala from the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) as it has failed to produce utilisation certificates for 50% of over ₹3,000 crore fund allotted to it after the 2018 floods, a senior Home Ministry official said on Thursday.

The Kerala government had demanded an additional ₹2,000 crore from the fund after the 2019 floods. Kerala was hit by successive floods in 2018 and 2019.

“The Kerala government has not been able to spend the amount released under the NDRF for the 2018 floods, nor they have been able to provide proof of the number of victims who were helped. Till April last year, they had spent only ₹900 crore out of ₹3,000 crore sanctioned funds,” said the official.

More than 400 people were killed and thousands displaced in 2018 when the State was hit by one of the worst floods in over 90 years. A year later, more than 100 were killed and over a thousand houses were damaged when Kerala was again affected by floods.

“Till the time the State government spends the assistance allotted to it for the financial year 2018-19, we cannot release any additional amount for 2019-20,” the official said.

Centre’s share

As per the National Disaster Management Authority’s website, as of December 31, 2019, the Centre’s share allocated to Kerala under the SDRF is ₹168.75 crore of which ₹52.27 crore has been released. In the current financial year, the Centre has released ₹8,068.33 crore to 27 States as Central share from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). The official said Kerala had around ₹300 crore in the SDRF kitty. Assistance under NDRF is released “in case of a disaster of severe nature, provided adequate funds are not available in SDRF”.

Kerala’s response

“The State’s contention is that its memorandum for 2019 has not been considered and approved for the amount permissible. The Centre has to sanction an amount to Kerala in view of the 2019 floods,” said Venu V., Principal Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management, Kerala.

“Whether we have cash with us or not is the secondary question. The primary question is whether they have examined our memorandum and taken a decision on it,” Mr. Venu said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hoz86g/article29212557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KERALA-FLOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-refuses-to-give-more-funds-to-kerala-for-flood-relief/article30640716.ece

92,2020/01/24,Police thwart sit-in against CAA in Varanasi,"The police on Thursday thwarted a sit-in against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Varanasi and took eight persons into custody.

A few protesters, mostly women, reached at Beniabagh Maidan in the afternoon, carrying national flags and banners against the CAA and a proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC).

In a video footage of the incident, the police were seen forcibly taking women away. The protesters accused the police of misbehaviour. But the police said the protest was illegal and no permission was sought.

District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said that as 8-10 men and some women had gathered at the spot for the protest, the police were deployed. Some of them threw stones at the policemen when they tried to arrest the women. The men were arrested, Mr. Sharma said. “They [the rest] are being identified through photographs and will be arrested,” Mr. Sharma said.

Mr. Sharma said a place had been designated for staging protests, and the Congress and the CPI(M) were recently allowed to conduct their programmes there as per law.

Security forces will be deployed at three places in the city, which the administration says could turn into protest sites.

“We will book them under the National Security Act if they disrupt the peace, because in Varanasi all dharmagurus have appealed to the people not to take to the streets and get into any unconstitutional acts,” Mr. Sharma said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/police-thwart-sit-in-against-caa-in-varanasi/article30636717.ece
93,2020/01/24,ITAT Bench camps soon,"The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) will set up Bench camps in Jammu and Srinagar for easy accessibility and speedy disposal of cases from the Union Territory.

ITAT President Justice P. P. Bhatt (retired) on Thursday said

Presently, litigants from the region have to approach its Amritsar Bench. In all, 235 cases from the region are pending disposal.

Justice Bhatt said he had informally suggested to the Central Board of Direct Taxes Chairman that there should be a mechanism in the form of arbitration and mediation, so that certain types of cases could be settled through alternative dispute resolution mechanism. He also discussed the issue with the Minister of State for Finance, Anurag Thakur.

Both welcomed the suggestion and were in principle in agreement with it, said Justice Bhatt. The government, he said, could come up with a legal framework. ITAT had volunteered to recommend the possible modalities. “It is better to have a statutory format so that it can be properly implemented.”

Justice Bhatt said the Tribunal had sent recommendations for induction of more members, as there were 42 vacancies compared to the sanctioned strength of 126. As on January 1, 2020, there were 89,412 pending appeal matters in ITAT.

This financial year, till December 31, the Tribunal disposed of 41,340 cases, while 37,956 new ones were instituted during the period.

95,2020/01/24,Peaceful protests will deepen democratic roots: Pranab,"In an obvious reference to the the ongoing peaceful protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and a National Register of Citizens exercise in the future, former President Pranab Mukherjee said on Thursday such agitations would lead to a deepening of the democratic roots.

Mr. Mukherjee was speaking at the first annual Sukumar Sen Memorial lecture organised by the Election Commission of India in honour of the first Chief Election Commissioner of India.

“Indian democracy has been tested time and again. The last few months have witnessed people come out on the streets in large numbers, particularly the young to voice out their views on issues which in their opinion are important. Their assertion and belief in the Constitution of India are particularly heartening to see. Consensus is the lifeblood of democracy. Democracy thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent,” he said.

In the written version of his speech, which he said he did not read out in its entirety due to health reasons, he said: “I believe the present wave of largely peaceful protests that have gripped the country shall again enable the further deepening of our democratic roots.”

Complimenting the ECI on its achievements, Mr. Mukherjee said challenges remained before the electoral system. He said the ECI embargoes sanction and implementation of development projects during elections, which impacts administration. He suggested that the Model Code of Conduct could be amended to ease the restrictions. He spoke of the number of parliamentary seats saying if the freeze was lifted, it could go up to 1,000 Lok Sabha seats. On women’s representation, he called for the “immediate passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill”.

On the role of the ECI, he said: “The Election Commission like its peers in other fields has served its purpose well, and any attempt at its denigration will amount to denigrating the electoral process itself. There can be no room for speculation that challenges the very basis of our democracy.”

Marking 70 years since its inception, the ECI had decided to start an annual lecture series from this year in the memory of Sukumar Sen, who had conducted the first two Lok Sabha elections in 1952 and 1957.

Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said the objective of the lecture series was to make a positive intervention in the democratic and electoral discourse.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e3fbsp/article30636131.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24PRANABMUKHERJEE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/peaceful-protests-will-deepen-democratic-roots-pranab/article30636132.ece
96,2020/01/24,"Nepal invites Modi, Imran for Sagarmatha Dialogue","Nepal has invited the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan along with several other heads of government and heads of state for the Sagarmatha Sambaad, officials in Kathmandu have confirmed. The first ever multi-stakeholder dialogue event is expected to be the biggest diplomatic initiative in Nepal’s recent history that will be attended by many global figures apart from the leaders of the member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).

“Invitations have been sent to over 150 foreign guests including heads of government and heads of state, Ministers, business leaders, media, members of multilateral organisations, think-tank experts, academics, civil society leaders and activists,” said a source who is aware of the work of the Sagarmatha Secretariat of Nepal’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The official also confirmed that other SAARC leaders have also been invited.

An Indian source has confirmed that South Block has received the invite from Kathmandu.

The Nepal Foreign Ministry headed by Pradeep Kumar Gyawali has been spearheading the work for the event which is scheduled to focus on the threat of climate change to the modern world. Given the large number of global leaders, the event is expected to serve as a venue for bilateral interaction among leaders from various countries.

India and Pakistan have been caught up in a cycle of hostility, which had prevented Islamabad from hosting the SAARC Summit in 2016. The Kathmandu event aims to draw all the SAARC leaders and provide an opportunity to break the ice. India had accused Pakistan of cross border terrorism while boycotting the Islamabad summit leading to its cancellation.

Earlier last week, the Ministry of External Affairs had announced that India has invited all heads of government of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation member countries, including Prime Minister Imran Khan for the heads of government council of the SCO that will be hosted by New Delhi later in 2020.

The April 2-4 Sagarmatha Sambaad will also highlight Nepal’s ability to assert its point of view before the global audience with officials saying that they are expected to build the event as a global and regional diplomatic venue.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vsq0sn/article30636597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sagarmatha-Sambaadjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nepal-invites-india-pakistan-for-sagarmatha-dialogue/article30635825.ece
97,2020/01/24,"GNLF, a BJP ally, seeks Sixth Schedule for Darjeeling","Expressing apprehension over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), a prominent political force in the Darjeeling hills of north Bengal and an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has raised afresh the demand for Sixth Schedule status for Darjeeling hills.

“While we are not opposing the CAA, there are some apprehensions about the CAA and NRC. This is mainly because the people of the hills are not good at paperwork and documentation,” GNLF Darjeeling leader Neeraj Zimba told The Hindu.

Long-pending demand

Mr. Zimba, an MLA who won the Darjeeling Assembly seat and was elected in May 2019 when he contested the by-polls with the support of BJP, said that the Sixth Schedule would not only allay the fears of the people of the hills but also recognise the long-pending demand of autonomous self-rule of the people of the hills.

“We want the BJP to take note of what they had promised in their manifesto in the 2019 polls that they are committed to finding a permanent political solution to the issue of the Darjeeling hills. The Sixth Schedule is the most sensible and feasible solution for the people of the hills,” he said, adding that experiments like the Gorkhland Territorial Administration, a regional autonomous body, had failed.

Bill pending

Referring to the situation in the northeast, where areas in States like Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura were under the Sixth Schedule, Mr. Zimba said that there is a rationale behind the demand, which was first raised by GNLF founder Subhash Ghising. Mr. Ghising was practically synonymous with the prolonged violent movement in the hills for a separate State of Gorkhaland. Mr. Zimba said that there was a Bill (for bringing the Darjeeling hills under the Sixth Schedule) pending in the House, for giving Sixth Schedule status to Darjeeling, which had been vetted by the Law Ministry.

Mamata’s visit

The development also assumes significance when Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is visiting the Darjeeling hills and has taken her opposition to the CAA to the region. Ms. Banerjee has been raising the issue that about 1 lakh Gorkhas had been left out of the NRC exercise in Assam. The Chief Minister, while raising the issue that her party had lost the elections in Darjeeling, added that this did not matter to her at the moment.

“Darjeeling is in danger and there is an attempt to snatch away citizenship rights from the people of Darjeeling,” Ms. Banerjee said in the hill town on Wednesday.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gnlf-a-bjp-ally-seeks-sixth-schedule-for-darjeeling/article30637567.ece

99,2020/01/24,"Pakistan makes progress on FATF goals, may get a reprieve from blacklist","Pakistan appeared to make some progress on convincing members of the global watchdog FATF (Financial Action Task Force) of its efforts to curb terror financing at a key meeting in Beijing on Thursday. A final decision on its “greylist” status is expected next month.

According to sources, Pakistan was cleared at the Asia Pacific Group (APG) meeting held in China from January 21 to 23 on 14 of the 27 specific counter-terror goals set by the body. The figure indicates that Islamabad is only half-way towards fulfilling its commitment, but is a significant improvement over its record before the FATF in October 2019, when it had only been cleared on five goals. Pakistan is understood to have convinced the committee that it has frozen the bank accounts and regulated access to funds for nine terrorists, including LeT chief Hafiz Saeed and Taliban leaders, banned by the UN Security Council.

The External Affairs Ministry refused to comment on the deliberations of the APG, which are confidential, but said India would watch the final result of the Plenary Group meeting beginning in Paris on February 16.

A positive recommendation from the APG could significantly reduce chances of a blacklist for Pakistan.

“We presume that the FATF will evaluate the progress made by Pakistan on the basis of the set criteria,” Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said on Thursday. “At the last plenary meeting in Paris in October, the body had expressed serious concerns with the lack of progress overall by Pakistan to address its terror financing risks, emanating from areas under its control. It is now for the members to decide [in February] whether Pakistan has fulfilled its commitments,” he said.

India, along with several countries in the 39-member body, had increased efforts to hold Pakistan to account on support to banned terror groups, which had led to it being placed on the ‘greylist’ in June 2018.

According to sources, Pakistan engaged several countries directly to gain some leniency in the process, which could have otherwise placed severe financial strictures on investment into the country. Prime Minister Imran Khan reportedly raised the FATF issue during talks with U.S. President Donald Trump at Davos this week. In addition, India’s strained ties with Malaysia and Turkey could mean that any attempt to blacklist Pakistan is vetoed by them.

China, the current President of the FATF and co-chair for APG, has praised the Pakistan team for the government’s efforts.

Ms. Reshma walked into the waiting halls meant for women and enquired about the facilities. She asked the DRM to provide feeding room for lactating mothers and improve amenities for special need passengers (Divyangs).

More CCTVs

In Eluru railway station, Mr. Nagwani asked the railway officials to provide ramps and provide more surveillance cameras. Another member, Mr. Sundar checked the expiry dates on the snacks and dairy products displayed in the stalls.

The DRM told the committee members that 76 surveillance cameras were installed in Vijayawada station and more would be fixed with Nirbhaya Fund soon. He gave a power point presentation on the round-the-clock facilities being provided to the passengers at the station.

Mr. Bhaskar Reddy told the committee members that the digital coach guidance system (big LCD TV) was installed at Anakapalle on trail basis and similar one would be arranged at the entrance of Vijayawada station soon.

“Scrapping the Council is tantamount to betrayal of Rajasekhara Reddy,” Mr. Tulasi Reddy observed.

It was ironic that the YSRCP that hired a noted legal counsel for ₹5 crore was talking about the money being spent on the Legislative Council, which was an important democratic institution, he said.

By saying that there was no benefit from the Council, the Chief Minister exhibited his lack of understanding, Mr. Tulasi Reddy said.

“If the Chief Minister can function from any place of his choice, then why did the YSRCP come up with the capital Bill?” Mr. Tulasi Reddy asked.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/congress-opposes-move-to-scrap-legislative-council/article30645253.ece

Addressing the media here on Friday, Mr. Amarnath said that in view of the developments in the Legislative Council, there could be a delay for two to three months in making the three capitals a reality.

Though members of the BJP, the PDF and an independent favoured voting on the capital and CRDA repeal Bills, the Legislative Council Chairman had referred them to the select committee.

“It is a sign of democracy being in danger,” he said, adding that people should think about it.

Debate on Council

Mr. Amarnath said the Council had to discuss the decisions taken by the Assembly and suggest measures.

“But the decision taken by the Chairman at the behest of former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has led to a debate over whether the Council should exist or not. Only six States have the Upper House. The State Assembly will debate upon it on Monday,” he said.

Former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had revived the Council with a view to ensuring democratic debates, but the purpose seemed to have been defeated, the MLA observed.

By opposing the Bills and ensuring that they were referred to the select committee, Mr. Naidu and his son Lokesh poured cold water on the aspirations of the people of the North Andhra and Rayalaseema regions.

The people of Visakhapatnam had parted with vast extents of land for projects such as steel plant, Shipyard, HPCL, and SEZ in the larger good of the country, and had been living amid pollution.

The people of North Andhra and Rayalaseema should see through the game plan of the TDP in opposing their growth, the MLA said.

Ms. Sunitha was addressing the media after paying tributes to her slain husband Ravindra on his 15th death anniversary here on Friday.

“We have lands in the historic Amaravati village and not in the capital region as is being alleged,” Ms. Sunitha said.

“Is it a crime to own land in the village, and how does its value appreciate when it is far away from the capital region?” Mr. Sriram asked.

Legal option

If the lands were adjoining the 29 villages that form part of the capital region, or inside it, the allegation that they were bought as a part of insider trading would have held water, but if wild allegations were made to defame us, we would deal with it legally, they warned.

“The people of Rapthadu are with the Paritala family even after the recent loss in the elections,” said Ms. Sunitha. She promised to serve the people of the constituency she had represented for three terms.

TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu had asked us to look after the party affairs in the Dharmavaram constituency too, the former Minister said, and added that soon she and her son would start meeting people in Dharmavaram to strengthen the party there.

Referring to the capital Bill introduced by the government, Ms. Sunitha took objection to the behaviour of the YSRCP Ministers. Abolishing the Legislative Council was not easy, she observed.

“The Council is meant to correct the mistakes committed in the Assembly. But the Chief Minister is behaving like a dictator,” Ms. Sunitha alleged.

Speaking the media here on Friday, he said the government could take such a policy decision only after putting the proposal in its poll manifesto and obtaining mandate from people for doing away with it.

He said the Council, an independent Constitutional body, could not be expected to toe the line of the Legislative Assembly. “It has every right to consider whether the Bills are in the larger interest of the State or not,” maintained Mr. Balasubrahmanyam, who had served as MLC for 13 years.

It was unfortunate that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had questioned the necessity for the Upper House, he said.

‘Meaningful debates’

More meaningful debates took place in the Upper House than in the lower house, he said and took exception to the Ministers who were responsible for the conduct of the Council proceedings smoothly, themselves causing ‘unprecedented’ pandemonium when it took up for discussion on the Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Bill and the AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of all Regions Bill.

The lawyers staged a protest outside the Collectorate in the morning, and later took out a bike rally in the city.

Kurnool district bar associations’ joint action committee convener Y. Jayaraju said that the move by the TDP was against people’s mandate. “Sending the Bill to a select committee and not back to Assembly is a misuse of power on the part of the Council’s chairman, and is blatantly undemocratic,” he added.

“The TDP has hoodwinked both Rayalaseema and North Andhra by not allowing the Bill to pass,” he said.

He alleged that Opposition leader and TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu had lost all political credibility by choosing to block the Bill.

Students termed the TDP leaders as ‘Rayalaseema Drohulu’ (traitors of Rayalaseema) and staged protests across the district. In Kurnool city, the Rayalaseema Yuvajana Vidhyarthi Joint Action Committee trooped into the district TDP office compound. However, they met with closed doors as the TDP activists decided stay away from the office.

The CID has already written to the Income Tax department and the Enforcement Directorate to probe allegations of huge purchase of lands by white ration card holders, suspected to be “benamis” of the senior leaders and also into allegations of huge money laundering in buying the lands.

Cases under Sections 418 IPC, 420, 406, and 409 IPC have been registered against the leaders.

Mr. Nara Lokesh, has been charged with purchase of land in the name of his benamis, Vemuri Ravi Kumar Prasad, former chairman of APNRT; Kanumuri Koteswara Rao and Cherukuri Ramakrishna. Mr. Ravi Kumar and Koteswara Rao were said to have bought lands to the extent of 25.91 acres during April 2014 to April 2019. All these transactions were carried out just before the GO 252, dated December 30, 2014, was issued by the government. Mr. Ramakrishna had also purchased 13.15 acres at Kanteru in April 2018.

117,2020/01/24,A.P. government to scrap Legislative Council?,"The Andhra Pradesh government seems to be contemplating abolishing the Legislative Council going by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s assertion that the “Upper House” did not deserve to exist if it rejects important Bills by violating rules.

In fact, Mr. Reddy urged Assembly Speaker Thammineni Seetharam to facilitate a discussion on the subject on January 27 so that the members could take a collective view on the alleged flouting of norms by Council Chairman Shariff Mohammed Ahmed in referring the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and CRDA Repeal Bills to a select committee and its repercussions.

‘Under pressure’

Making a statement on the reference of the Bills to a select committee in the Assembly on Thursday, the Chief Minister alleged that Mr. Ahmed could not apparently go by the rule book as he was under tremendous pressure from former CM N. Chandrababu Naidu, who was sitting in the Council.

Not only YSR Congress MLCs but also those belonging to the Left parties, the BJP, the Congress and independents found fault with the conduct of the Chairman.

If the Chairman was allowed to be swayed by a particular party, the consequences would be terrible in future, he warned, insisting that serious thought needed to be given to the relevance of the Council.

‘Political agenda’

Mr. Jagan observed that the Council was working with a political agenda, which was evident from the rejection of two Bills on the formation of separate SC and ST Commissions and the introduction of English medium in government schools.

Besides, the Council Chairman sent the decentralisation and CRDA repeal Bills to a select committee after initially agreeing to stick to rules, the Mr Jagan said, claiming that the Constitution was silent about ‘capitals’ and the government was free to discharge its functions from any place of its choice.

As far as the Council Chairman’s discretion was concerned, the Mr Jagan said it was used to violate rules, adding amendments to the Bills should have been moved within 12 hours of their consideration but it did not happen in the present instance.

Only six States in India had Councils and in A.P., the expenditure on it came to ₹60 crore per year.

It was unfortunate that the descendants of those who had lived in the country for generations were being asked to prove their citizenship, said the activists led by theologians Moulana Abid and Moulana Sharief. They urged Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to oppose CAA, NCR and NPR in the State.

They raised slogans against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre for allegedly implementing ‘sectarian’ agenda of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and ‘vitiating the secular fabric of the nation’.

The protesters alleged that the BJP government was trying to create a rift among various religions in the country. They said that CAA was against the Constitution as it goes against Article 14.

If a nationwide NRC was taken up, rural poor, Dalits, minorities and tribes would be put to trouble as they would not have proper documents.

They criticised the State government and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for bringing NPR to the State. The protesters demanded that the State government must pass a resolution against CAA-NRC-NPR so that the minorities in the State were put at ease.

He observed that the Land Pooling System (LPS) that was adopted by the TDP Government could have been a model for the country, but people would be henceforth scared away by it due to the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) Government’s proposal to shift the capital out of the Vijayawada-Guntur region.

The LPS would be the chosen way in future to procure lands for projects as the Land Acquisition Act entailed huge costs, he observed.

Mr. Madhav said the BJP-led NDA Government carried forward the good works done by UPA government and it would be foolish to stop everything with suspicion. However, corrupt deals could be certainly exposed and culprits punished, he said, suggesting that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy should give up his prejudicial mindset.

Mr. Madhav said the capital issue raked up by the YSRCP Government aroused regional feelings which were difficult to contain. It (the government) should instead focus on the development of backward areas, for which the Centre would extend necessary financial assistance.

123,2020/01/24,Govt. can get the Bills passed easily: Ex-Speaker,"Amid confusion over the three capitals issue and likely legislative and legal hurdles, a former Speaker’s view seems to offer a solution to the ruling YSR Congress Party which is determined to get the Decentralisation of Development and Repeal of CRDA Bills passed.

It looks like getting the Bills passed is a cakewalk for the Assembly. The Legislative Council’s decision of referring them to a select committee can be reversed with its decision, according to former Speaker of the combined Andhra Pradesh K.R. Suresh Reddy.

Mr. Reddy is of the view that the Council has used the rule position as a weapon, but the Assembly can exercise its powers to get them passed in the form they wish.

Speaking to The Hindu on the over phone, Mr. Suresh Reddy said, “In my view, the Upper House (Council) is more of recommendatory in nature. The select committee should be viewed as a recommendation by the Council. The Assembly can send its own version of the Bills once again and get them passed ultimately.”

The decision on select committee is a contradiction between the Assembly and the Council. Since the decision has been taken, the matter should be referred to the Assembly as per rules, and the Assembly is empowered to take a final call on the Bills, he said.

Latest precedent

For instance, the Education Bill 1/1982-(Amendment Act) 2019 was passed by the Assembly and was referred to the Council. The Council had sent it back with recommendations to it but the same Bill was passed by the Assembly for the second time on Thursday, rejecting the recommendations.

For record, Chairman of the Council Mohd Ahmed Shariff, instead of rejecting it or returning it with recommendations, referred the Bills to a select committee after amid heated arguments by members of the ruling the YSR Congress, the Opposition TDP and others.

124,2020/01/24,Dadi: what Shariff did was constitutional impropriety,"YSRCP general secretary Dadi Veerabhadra Rao on Thursday accused Legislative Council Chairman M.A. Shariff of committing constitutional impropriety by referring the Bills on decentralisation of capital and repeal of APCRDA to the select committee.

“The TDP members, who were in a majority in the Upper House, had neither served any notice as required nor sought any amendments for referring the Bills to the select committee. As per rules, the notice or amendments, if any suggested, should be printed and tabled in the Council for circulation,” Mr. Rao, a former Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council, told reporters here.

For the first time in the history, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly N. Chandrababu Naidu sat in the VIP gallery with a view to bringing pressure on Mr. Shariff to give the ruling using his discretionary power, Mr. Rao alleged.

Instead, the Chairman should have referred the Bills to the joint select committee of the legislature, Mr. Rao opined.

Dig at Naidu

Mr. Naidu was determined to stall development in the State despite his party’s rejection in the elections, the YSRCP leader said.

“The action of Mr. Shariff and Mr. Naidu will force other States to debate on the relevance of the Upper House,” he remarked.

Stating that Mr. Naidu was successful in temporarily stalling the passage of the two Bills, he said the YSRCP would go ahead with the formation of the Legislative capital in Amaravati, Judicial capital in Kurnool and Executive capital in Visakhapatnam as early as possible.

Mr. Rao said the reason for decentralised development mooted by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was to remove the backwardness in the Rayalaseema and North Andhra regions.

Advice to TDP

He also asked the TDP leaders to open their voice against the “parochial and partisan” behaviour of Mr. Naidu and his determination to help all those allegedly involved in insider trading in Amaravati.

As part of insider trading, 760 acres was bought by nearly 800 white card holders, he said, and justified the reference of the scam to the Enforcement Directorate and the Income-Tax Department.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dadi-what-shariff-did-was-constitutional-impropriety/article30637441.ece

This was the second time the Assembly passed the Bill. In December 2019, the Bill was passed, but the Legislative Council suggested amendments such as – option may be given to the students or parents as to which medium (English or Telugu, or the mother tongue) the students intend to study; the attainment of prescribed standards of proficiency in the mother tongue, English and Hindi; the standards of education and courses of study in educational institutions, including instruction both in the mother tongue and English medium.

After a detailed discussion, the Assembly passed the Bill without agreeing to the amendments made by the Council.

Earlier, intervening in the discussion, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the Bill seeks to provide English medium education to the children who cannot afford to go to private schools due to exorbitant fee.

The Legislative Council, however, had rejected the Bill without realising that it could not do anything except play the role of a spectator if the Assembly decided to ratify the legislation whether or not the Council gave its nod, he observed.

The Council should have understood that the Bill was in the interest of the poor children and it was not intended to derive any political mileage.

“The Bill enables children belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), Backward Classes (BCs) and other economically weaker sections that their chances of getting well-paid jobs are not marred because of lack of proficiency in English language,” he said.

Vidya Kanuka kits

The Chief Minister announced that kits containing text and notebooks and other stationery would be provided to all the 36.10 lakh primary school children on June 1 just before the commencement of the academic year as part of the Vidya Kanuka scheme for which ₹487 crore had been allocated.

Narayana and Prathipati Pulla Rao and a former sarpanch from Venkatapalem — Bellamkonda Narasimha Rao — over allegations of land grabbing, cheating and intimidation in the Capital region during 2014-19.

This follows the decision of the government to get allegations involving assigned land investigated. Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy had stated in the Assembly that TDP leaders and their supporters had threatened Dalits and pocketed huge tracts of assigned land.

The CID booked cases under Sections 420, 506 and 120-B of IPC and Sections 3 (1), (9) of the SC, ST (POA) Amendment Act, 2015, on the basis of a complaint lodged by a Dalit woman from Venkatapalem that she was forced to sell her assigned land measuring 90 cents at a throwaway price.

Pothuraju Bujji alleged that Mr. Narasihma Rao had called her to his house in October 2015 and told her that the government would take her over the land for the construction of the Capital and that she would not get any compensation.

On October 20, 2015, Mr. Narasimha Rao, in the presence of Mr. Narayana and Pulla Rao gave her ₹20 lakh and made her sign on blank stamp papers and white papers. He gave an additional ₹4 lakh in April 2016, the woman alleged.

In December 2016, Mr. Narasimha Rao, on behalf of her family, registered the land with the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) in return for developed plots, and in April 2017, she had come to know that the CRDA had allotted 780 square yards of residential plot and 180 square yards of commercial plot. Later, she came to know that some people in her colony had sold returnable plots for over ₹2 crore. After realising that she had been cheated, she confronted Mr. Narasimha Rao, but he did not respond. She then decided that she would not register the plots to Mr. Narasimha Rao.

127,2020/01/24,Kota Srinivas Poojary urges bar owners not to use boards with names of gods,"Minister for Muzrai Kota Srinivas Poojary said on Friday that he was appealing to the owners of bar and restaurants and wine shops not to name their bars and shops after gods and religious icons, thereby hurting the sentiments of people.

At a press meet, he said several people have appealed to him to take some measures to stop this practice. The Minister clarified, however, that this could not be forced upon the owners. He was only requesting them to respect the religious sentiments of people by not using such names. Earlier, the department was mulling over the possibility of legally banning naming bars after gods and had sought the opinion of the Law and Excise departments.

The Minister said that the Muzrai Department has constituted a committee to submit a report on the feasibility of rich temples opening schools to teach Sanskrit, Vedas, and Aagama Shastra and limiting the duration of their study to five years. In addition, the committee will study whether it is possible to introduce one-year special courses in related subjects. The committee is expected to submit its report in two months.

Mr. Poojary said the government would introduce a scheme called ‘Jalabhisheka’, and under it temple ponds, kalyanis and other waterbodies of temples would be rejuvenated. Funds from temples and companies from their CSR budgets and donations of philanthropists will be used. The works will be taken up through ‘shramdaan’ by people and under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kota-srinivas-poojary-urges-bar-owners-not-to-use-boards-with-names-of-gods/article30647037.ece
128,2020/01/24,Karnataka Cabinet expansion: The ball is still in Yediyurappa’s court,"Though the delay in Cabinet expansion in Karnataka is attributed to the busy schedule of the BJP central leadership, it is learnt that it is more because of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa being unable to finalise the names of BJP legislators to be included in the Cabinet.

“Both the new entrants to the party and the old-timers will have to be included in the Ministry. However, the Chief Minister is yet to finalise the names of the old-timers to be included,” said a source in the party’s central unit.

Denying that the central leadership was either too busy or reluctant to hold consultations with Mr. Yediyurappa on Cabinet expansion, the source said that the top brass would readily do so as soon as he finalised the names of the BJP old-timers to be made Ministers. “The onus on finalisation of ministerial probables is on the Chief Minister. As he is yet to complete that process, the ball is still in his court,” a central leader said.

At the same time, he expressed optimism about the time required for finalisation of the names, maintaining that it would be possible to complete the process within the next three days, as had been announced by the Chief Minister.

Meanwhile, sources denied reports that the party high command had insisted upon including only six of the 11 newly elected MLAs in the Cabinet. “We will have to include all 11 migrants who won in the Assembly bypolls. However, if the Chief Minister wants, he can convince one or two to drop their demand for a ministerial berth. The central leadership is okay with including all 11,” a source said, while making it clear that there was no question of accommodating the defeated defectors and those who did not contest the polls.

The sources also made it clear that the party high command had not instructed or insisted upon dropping any incumbent Ministers to remove caste and regional imbalances. It may be noted that the State Cabinet will have more representatives from the Lingayat community and Belagavi district with the inclusion of the newly elected MLAs. Sources said it was not possible to rectify this as the party was obliged to give representation in the Cabinet to migrant MLAs in recognition of their help in government formation.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kqulxd/article30647030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGYEDIYURAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-cabinet-expansion-the-ball-is-still-in-yediyurappas-court/article30647031.ece
129,2020/01/24,Hakki-Pikki couple from Karnataka to be VIPs in national capital on Republic Day,"Hooraja and Chandasi, a Hakki-Pikki couple from Angadihalli in Belur taluk, have been chosen by the State government to attend the Republic Day programme in New Delhi. The couple will get a chance to meet the country’s President, Vice-President and Prime Minister during their stay in the capital.

Every year, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs invites representatives of tribal communities to witness the Republic Day programme. This year, the State has picked Mr. Hooraja and Ms. Chandasi.

When The Hindu met the couple at Angadihalli, both were excited about their visit. They are among the 350 Hakki-Pikki families living in the village. The community has many special practices, including that of naming their children after the place, country, things and personalities — like Mysuru Pak, Cycle, Thirthahalli, and Madenur. A majority of them collect plant extracts to prepare medicines. They travel to sell their medicines and some have gone abroad. Their ancestors used to live in forest areas and shifted to this place in the early 1960s.

For the past two decades, the community has been fighting for land to till and construct houses. “We do not have a burial ground. For some years, we used to bury the dead in a vacant plot of land, but that led to clashes with others in the village,” said Mr. Hooraja. In February 2016, some of them were arrested following a clash with upper caste people who objected to the tribals using vacant land for defecation.

Mr. Hooraja, who has been working as convener of the Karnataka Aranya Moola Budakattu Samudayagala Okkoota, wants to raise the trial community’s issues with the Prime Minister. “The Forest Dwellers Act guarantees forest land of up to 10 acres, but no one in Hassan district has got this,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/59s1xo/article30646997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGHAKKI2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hakki-pikki-couple-from-karnataka-to-be-vips-in-national-capital-on-r-day/article30646998.ece

The State government had given its approval for the work of modernisation of Tunga canal in April 2016 at a cost of ₹239 crore.

The left bank canal of Tunga reservoir is of 102 kilometre length while the right bank canal is of 54 kilometre length. There were allegations that concrete walls had collapsed at many places owing to sub-standard work and that the terms and conditions in the contract of maintaining thickness of concrete lining and the concrete bed, and construction of columns with metal pillars at regular distance along the concrete lining to ensure stability of the structure was violated at many places.

At the meeting held at Zilla Panchayat hall in the city on Friday to review the implementation of Karnataka Development Programmes, Mr. Eshwarappa said that in the wake of allegations of irregularities in executing the works, a committee comprising all the seven MLAs from the district, and the president and vice-president of Zilla Panchayat has been formed to conduct a probe in this regard.

He said that the second phase of Tunga canal modernisation work was estimated to cost ₹ 140 crore of which ₹80 crore has already been paid for the contractor who has executed the work. He directed the officials of Department of Water Resources to halt the work and to stop making further cash payments till the completion of the probe.

Damage to schools

Regarding the damage caused by rain and floods in 2019 to government school buildings in the district, the Minister said that according to information provided by Department of Public Instruction, as many as 1,707 rooms of 791 government lower and higher primary schools and 37 government high schools need immediate repair. The State government has already released ₹34 crore for the purpose, he said.

Sand extraction

Deputy Commissioner K.B. Sivakumar told the meeting that extraction of sand has already commenced at 35 authorised blocks on river banks in the district.

Mr. Eshwarappa directed the officials of Department of Mines and Geology to install surveillance cameras at the sand extraction blocks and checkposts to avoid illegal transportation of sand.

131,2020/01/24,Few takers for crop insurance,"Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs J.C. Madhuswamy took officers to task over only a few farmers applying for crop insurance in the rabi season this year.

At a KDP review meeting here on Friday, the Minister noted that only 118 farmers had taken crop insurance in the district. Among them, there were none from Channarayapatna, Sakleshpur and Alur taluks.

Mr. Madhuswamy wanted to know from the officers of the Agriculture Department and Lead Bank the reason for it. K. Madhusudan, Joint Director of Agriculture Department, and Basavaraj of Lead Bank failed to give a satisfactory response.

Warning

The Minister said even those who took crop loan were not covered under the insurance scheme. He warned the officers of disciplinary action for their failure in educating the farmers about the scheme and extending them the benefits.

Hospitals

While reviewing the schemes of the Health and Family Welfare Department, the Minister took note of people preferring private hospitals to government hospitals for deliveries. He said that the officers failed to attract people to the government hospitals. The field workers were not being utilised properly. “You should stop supporting the private hospitals”, he said and also warned District Health Officer K.M. Sathish Kumar of disciplinary action.

H.K. Kumaraswamy and K.M.Shivalinge Gowda, MLAs, alleged that many government doctors refer patients to private hospitals as the two had an understanding.

“In many cases, the government doctors ask the patients to go to a particular private hospital, where they treat them. The government should stop government doctors going to private hospitals”, said Mr. Shivalinge Gowda.

Vacancies

When the MLAs raised the issue of vacancies in hospitals, the Minister said the government had taken enough care to ensure gynaecologists were posted in all hospitals. “It is the failure of officers concerned if they have let posts of gynaecologists remain vacant”, he said.

Minister in-charge of the district S. Suresh Kumar visited the site where the statue has been proposed at Deepada Giri Oddu and saw the blueprint of the project.

Mr. Kumar, who is the Minister for Primary and Secondary Education, inspected various development woks on the hilltop and visited the temple on Thursday. Deputy Commissioner B.B. Kaveri and senior officials accompanied him.

The development works were being carried out under Sri Male Mahadeshwara Swami Kshetra Development Authority. The Minister also inspected the arrangements being made for the forthcoming Mahashivaratri festival. Mr. Kumar examined the construction of a 90 lakh litre underground water tank which will cater to the drinking water needs of a large number of pilgrims. After visiting the temple, he visited the laddu-making unit and spoke to the staff engaged in the preparation of laddus, which is distributed as ‘prasadam’ to the devotees. He also visited the Dasoha Bhavan and checked the food preparation.

The Minister collected details from the officials on the progress made in the construction of a huge kalyani and a dormitory for accommodating pilgrims. A guest house with 512 rooms is also coming up and the Minister inspected its works. A ramp was also under construction at Jenumalai Guest House.

The Minister later held a meeting with the officials and directed them to complete the works, particularly the guest house work, at the earliest besides procuring basics to make the dormitory functional at the earliest.

The BSNL officials who were present at the meeting said an additional mobile tower would be set up on the hilltop to address the network problems faced by the locals as well as pilgrims.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/y4reu1/article30646735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24CHAMLADDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/100-ft-tall-mahadeshwara-statue-on-mm-hills-planned/article30646738.ece
133,2020/01/24,"Minorities being misled, says Santhosh","BJP National General Secretary (Organisation) B.L. Santhosh said here on Friday that the leaders spearheading the campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were misleading the minorities of the country.

He was addressing a large gathering of party leaders, activists and the general public as part of the BJP’s mass awareness programme through a series of door-to-door campaigns and public meetings to build support for the CAA and dent the opposition to it.

Mr. Santhosh described the protests and the narratives against the CAA as the “biggest disinformation campaign’’ being floated by the Opposition with the help of “leftists and so-called intellectuals’’.

They have built a strong network and this, he said, was reflected in the serial protests at the local circles in the cities and the editorials in the media. But the BJP was determined to fight it out and was confident of riding out the storm.

“The CAA is not meant for people born and brought up in India and is an Act bestowing citizenship and dignity on the persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. It is a constitutional, cultural and historical obligation and has nothing to do with the Indian Muslims or other minority groups’’, he added.

Minorities in India have always been protected and there is no discrimination on religious grounds. Sky is the limit for their personal growth and is evident in their success in various fields ranging from film industry to sports and politics, said Mr. Santosh.

The Act was passed by Parliament which is supreme and the State legislatures cannot reject it as it is unconstitutional and not worth the paper on which the resolutions are adopted, said Mr. Santosh, referring to the resolutions passed against the CAA by the Kerala and the Punjab Assemblies. ‘’It may give them succour and satisfaction for a day but the resolution will go to the waste paper basket’’, he added.

The sustained disinformation campaign has misled a section of the minorities of the country who fear that the government was out to take away their citizenship, snatch away their ration card, Aadhaar card etc. But the truth cannot be masked for long, said Mr.Santosh.

The issue of granting citizenship had been kept pending by successive governments who allowed the problem to fester but the BJP was keen to resolve it. The BJP was also keen to resolve the Cauvery dispute, Belagavi dispute and similar issues “’within the next five years’’as they impede the economic growth of the country.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/minorities-being-misled-says-santhosh/article30646733.ece

The bank’s bottomline grew in the quarter thanks to a surge in retail loans and a decline in bad loans. In Q3, the bank’s total income stood at ₹14,001.63, up from ₹13,513.35 crore a year ago.

On the NPA front, bank’s net non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets stood at 5.05%, down from 6.37% a year ago. The percentage of its gross NPAs also reduced to 8.36% from 10.25% a year ago.

“The Union government should not collect any tax from Khadi industry as it is not like other manufacturing industries that aim at making profits. Khadi is more like a service industry where making profit is not the primary motto; therefore, to preserve and popularise Khadi tradition, the Union government should make Khadi tax free,” he said.

Addressing presspersons here on Friday, he also demanded that the Union government form a Ministry for Khadi like in the case of Kerala which has a Minister for Development of Khadi.

Stating that the Defence Ministry has placed a demand for supplying Khadi-based clothes to be distributed among defence personnel, Mr. Patil, however, regretted that in the absence of adequate resources, the industry may find it difficult to meet the huge demand.

“We have no dearth of demand for Khadi products, but in the absence of adequate funds and raw material, we are unable to meet the increasing demand. We need at least ₹ 5 crore per annum to purchase raw material for manufacturing Khadi products,” he said.

He said that Khadi exhibitions were being held in Vijayapura since 2005 with the available resources and they have been registering a good turnover.

He said that since 2010, exhibitions have recorded turnovers between ₹ 80 lakh and ₹ 2 crore each year.

Basavaraj Marabasanavar had married Malavva as he had six daughters from his first marriage and he wanted a son, instead. However, his two wives did not get along well. They fought with each other and with Marabasanavar frequently. The fights did not reduce even after Malavva delivered two sons.

139,2020/01/24,Orders on anticipatory bail plea in sedition case posted for January 27,"The orders on the anticipatory bail petition filed by Nalini Balakumar, who has been booked for sedition by the Mysuru city police for holding aloft a “free Kashmir” placard, will be pronounced on Monday.

The Second Additional District Judge, Mysuru, R. Mendonca, is hearing the anticipatory bail petitions of Ms. Balakumar and Maridevaiah, president of the University of Mysore’s Research Scholars’ Association. During a two-hour hearing on Friday, a battery of six advocates from different parts of the State argued in favour of Ms. Balakumar while public prosecutor H.D. Anand Kumar opposed the bail.

Mr. Kumar sought to dismiss the concerns expressed by the petitioners’ lawyers that Ms. Balakumar would be subjected to harassment. Also, an investigation by the police will not necessarily lead to arrest, he said, before pointing out that taking the accused into police custody was the prerogative of the investigating officer.

Baburaj, who argued for Ms. Balakumar, said the petitioner was only seeking removal of the restrictions imposed by the government in Kashmir. “Free Kashmir means there should be no restrictions. People should be allowed to move around freely. This is what she meant. Unfortunately, it has been misinterpreted,” she said.

Also, Mr. Baburaj said, Ms. Balakumar’s concept of nationality covered the entire country, including Kashmir. “If anyone from Kashmir or Kerala or Assam is hurt, it pains her as she is a citizen of India,” he said.

Prasanna, another advocate, said the petitioner’s actions did not incite violence to overthrow an elected government and, hence, did not amount to sedition. “Based on the available evidence, there is no case for sedition,” he said.

Contending that there was a difference between free speech and hate speech aimed at overthrowing an elected government, he said every citizen was entitled to having differences of opinion with the elected government while also loving the country at the same time. “Criticism of government policy does not amount to sedition,” he said.

Though the public prosecutor for the bail petitions of Mr. Maridevaiah and Ms. Balakumar is the same person, Raghunath, who appeared for Mr. Maridevaiah, said the orders on the petitions would be issued separately.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/orders-on-anticipatory-bail-plea-in-sedition-case-posted-for-january-27/article30645857.ece

Hassan secured the top position in the State last year with the highest pass percentage.

B.H. Shekharappa, Senior Assistant Director of the Examination Board, has sent this direction to zonal officers of the department. Interestingly, this letter refers to a teacher’s complaint alleging malpractices during the examination in Hassan district in 2019.

The complainant is Shivakumar, a high school teacher at Channaraypatna. He, in his letter to the Commissioner of Public Instructions, had alleged that the then Deputy Director of Public Instructions of Hassan, Manjunath, gave an oral order to allow malpractice in the exams. Besides that, the then Block Education Officer of Channarayapatna taluk, Pushpavathi, allowed malpractice in the taluk, he had alleged. “Because of such steps, Hassan stood first in the State,” he had alleged.

Further, he cautioned that this year too there could be malpractices on a large scale and CCTV cameras should be installed to ensure a fair examination, without hurting the morale of the students, he added.

However, K.S. Prakash, DDPI of Hassan, told presspersons that the complaint was baseless.

“We will find out who the complainant is. So far we just know the name of the person. We will ask him to furnish evidence to support his allegations,” he said.

Mr. Prakash said Hassan district stood first in the overall pass percentage and also in terms of the quality of results. “Among those cleared the exams, 32% of students secured A and A+ grades.

144,2020/01/24,ID verification drive of workers sets off speculations,"An ID verification exercise conducted for plantation workers in Kodagu by the district police on Thursday triggered speculations that information was being collected for National Register of Citizens (NRC) and illegal migrants, if any, would be weeded out.

The speculations gained credence in the backdrop of the current debate on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the NRC, and the confusion around it.

However, Superintendent of Police, Kodagu, Suman D. Pennekar clarified that it was a routine exercise that was done every year to ascertain the identification of workers from other parts of the country who come to Kodagu for jobs. “Besides, the police are not the agency for NRC work,” she said.

Ms. Pennekar said there were a few cases of heinous crimes committed by migrant workers in the recent past and later the suspects could not be tracked easily as their identity and background had not been properly checked before being provided local jobs. This led to difficult in tracing them, she said.

“This exercise was not directed against workers from any particular State or any community but was conducted for all workers who have come to Kodagu in search of jobs,” Ms. Pennekar said.

She said that earlier the exercise took place at the local jurisdictional station level or the police would visit the estates to ascertain the identity of workers. But this time it was a centralised one at the taluk level as the police wanted to verify the ID proof with the details available online, she added.

This was a one-day endeavour and a majority of them had submitted the documents and ID proof and those who could not provide the requisite documents had been provided ample time to procure them, Ms. Pennekar said.

While this would act as a preventive measure against crimes a strong message was also being sent to estate owners to ensure that they ascertained the identity of workers they hired and verified the documents, she added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/28fcza/article30639213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6702HI-W01725RGA1713EGP3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/id-verification-drive-of-workers-sets-off-speculations/article30640851.ece

District president of the committee, Eranna Zhalki, said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to generate two crore jobs a year, but the National Sample Survey Office report indicates the unemployment rate rising to 6.1 % — the highest in 45 years.

Mr. Zhalki said that according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the unemployment rate has risen to 8.48%. While the unemployment rate in urban areas stands at 8.89%, it is 8.28% in rural areas.

146,2020/01/24,Karnataka for direct recruitment of doctors,"Karnataka Minister for Health B. Sriramulu on Thursday said the government had resolved to go in for direct appointment of doctors to government hospitals instead of recruiting them through the Karnataka State Public Commission. There was a shortage of about 3,500 doctors in the State and the posts would be filled in the next three months, he added.

New district hospital

The Minister was speaking after inaugurating the 300-bed district hospital on KRS Road here.

The hospital, with about 19 departments, has been built at a cost of ₹75.5 crore and it would take at least a few months for it to become fully functional since it required around 330 staff, including 60 doctors, and medical equipment.

Mr. Sriramulu also announced funds for procuring equipment to the new hospital.

The Minister said it was decided to go in for direct recruitment of doctors since appointments through KPSC were taking a long time.

“A decision on this was taken by the Cabinet. The DHOs had been asked to appoint doctors to the district hospitals and PHCs directly,” he said.

Mr. Sriramulu said ₹25 crore had been allocated for procuring cancer detection equipment for district hospitals.

He said government hospitals would get dialysis and scanning units and tests would be done for free for the poor as the amount would be reimbursed under the National Health Mission.

The Minister also said the government was considering to raise salaries of nursing staff, and the contract nursing staff would be regularised.

Mysuru, a ‘health hub’

Mysuru was inching towards becoming a “health hub” with so many public healthcare projects becoming a reality. After Sri Jayadeva Institute, the district hospital had been launched. The super-speciality hospital was also taking shape, besides the trauma care centre which was expected to become operational soon, said Mr. Sriramulu.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-for-direct-recruitment-of-doctors/article30638054.ece

149,2020/01/24,"Now, Vijayapura pomegranates tomake a splash in overseas markets","After the delicious and juicy grapes from Vijayapura that made waves in the international market recently, it is now the turn of the large and dark-saffron pomegranate to go to overseas markets from here.

While the grapes are being exported to some West Asian counties, and recently China, the local pomegranate is being sold in nations such as Qatar, Oman and Kuwait.

Aquib Almelkar, who owns export licence in the trade name of Star Fruits and is a major exporter of grapes and pomegranates, says: “There is a great demand for grapes and pomegranates from Vijayapura in West Asian, European and other Asian countries. This is primarily because of the colour, taste and quality of the fruits.”

He said that since the climate and soil of Vijayapura is suitable and has emerged as the best for cultivating quality fruits, overseas buyers are fond of these fruits.

Mr. Almelkar, who recently exported about 250 tonnes of grapes to China, is also exporting pomegranates.

He has selected the Kesar variety of pomegranate for exports because the variety is the best in all aspects — size, colour, taste and quality.

Most of the fruits are collected from places such as Indi taluk, Vijayapura taluk and Babaleshwar constituency which are pomegranate-growing areas.

“We select pomegranates that weigh between 250 grams and 350 grams, with 50 mm-80 mm diameter and are bright and shiny in colour. Only these types of fruits are suitable for exports,” Mr. Almelkar said.

He said that since maintaining quality and checking chemical residue is essential for exports, the quality and residue are tested at a government certified agency. If the residue is found to be more than permitted limit, then the fruits are rejected.

“After testing and getting confirmation only we go ahead with the exporting process to make sure the consignments do not get rejected. It will be a huge loss for us if the consignment gets rejected and more importantly, a black mark on us,” he said.

“Exports of pomegranates have multiple advantages. On the one hand, they create brand value for Vijayapura district and on the other, they give higher revenue to farmers as export-quality fruits are sold at higher prices. This will encourage other farmers to produce quality fruits to earn higher profits,” Mr. Almelkar added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/y8b3pq/article30637891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22BGVIJAYAPURAPOMEGRANATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/now-vijayapura-pomegranates-tomake-a-splash-in-overseas-markets/article30637892.ece
150,2020/01/24,BJP makes U-turn as Karnataka government notifies anti-superstition Act,"The governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had termed as “anti-Hindu” the Karnataka Prevention and Eradication of Inhuman Evil Practices and Black Magic Act, 2017 while it was in the Opposition, has now made a U-turn as the State government has notified the Act.

The Social Welfare Department, which is the nodal department, has formally notified the Act and it came into effect from January 4, 2020. The BJP and some Hindutva groups had strongly opposed the Bill passed by the Congress government led by Siddaramaiah in 2017.

The law bans several practices, including facilitating any person or persons to roll over leaves on which others have partaken food in any public or religious place or similar practices that violate human dignity (made snana); coercing any person to perform firewalk at the time of jatras/religious festivals, causing physical injury; practice of piercing rods from one side of jaw to the other, including the tongue, (baibiga practice); pelting stones in the name of banamati; and mata-mantra on residential houses during night or day.

According to rules that have been issued, the government will take up programmes to create awareness among citizens about the “ill effects of the inhuman evil practices and black magic” apart from providing medical relief to persons injured because of superstitious acts.

Vigilance officers will be appointed to monitor implementation of the law and they will be assisted by the police, it said. Persons who obstruct the discharge of duties of the vigilance officers would face imprisonment for not less than three months or a fine of up to ₹5,000 or both.

The Act states that a half-yearly review will be done to check the status of the implementation of the law and the State police chief is expected to submit district-wise details on cases that have been filed.

Congress govt. had refrained from notifying Act

The erstwhile Siddaramaiah government, which had worked on, finalised and framed rules for the law against superstitious practices back in 2017, had refrained from notifying the Act fearing protests from Hindu organisations and possible electoral setback. The BJP, then in the Opposition, had strongly opposed the Act.

T.B. Jayachandra, who piloted the Bill as the Law Minister then, told The Hindu on Thursday that the government then framed rules for the Act but refrained from notifying them expecting public outrage.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/m4k1m1/article30637783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGMADESNANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bjp-makes-u-turn-government-notifies-anti-superstition-act/article30637784.ece
151,2020/01/24,"BJP will not accept you as equals, says Kumaraswamy to Lingayats","In what is being seen as an outreach to the Veerashaiva–Lingayat community that has long moved away from the Janata Parivar to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Thursday cautioned that the Veerashaivas who had been wooed by the BJP “will never be accepted as equals”.

Mr. Kumaraswamy, who draws his political strength from the Vokkaliga heartland in Old Mysore region, was especially critical of the BJP and Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa for letting down farmers of north Karnataka, a significant part of whom belong to the Lingayat community. “What is the condition of farmers belonging to the Lingayat community after the floods? With no assistance coming, these farmers are in debt,” he said.

His remarks on Lingayats and BJP leaders came at a meeting of JD(S) leaders, convened to discuss the modalities to strengthen the party, especially in the light of the collapse of the JD(S)–Congress coalition, and also the drubbing that the party received in the Assembly bypolls in December 2019.

Floods and Mahadayi

He said: “Nobody talks about the Mahadayi or the flood issue. How long do you [Veerashaiva–Lingayats] want to go with people based on caste?”

The former Chief Minister said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were out not only to harm Muslims, but also Hindus. “The BJP will never consider a Vokkaliga or a Veerashaiva/Lingayat as their own, but as shudras. The appeal to bring all Hindus together is only a political ploy during elections. This is the agenda of the VHP and the RSS.” He said that Veerashaivas/Lingayats should be beware of the hidden agenda, and that the BJP was not going to be with the community.

Meanwhile, acknowledging that the JD(S) was at the crossroads after the fall of the coalition government and the bypolls loss, he told the gathering, “We are at the crossroads, but do not lose confidence. You have the strength. We will start a Janandolana (people’s movement) and go from house to house highlighting issues affecting the country.”

The meeting passed resolutions seeking withdrawal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, condemning the current economic scenario, and urging the Centre to release ₹5,000 crore towards relief for flood-affected people.

Response to Shobha

Responding to BJP leader Shobha Karandlaje’s tweet on the JD(S) “kneeling before the Congress”, Mr. Kumaraswamy said it was Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa who had knocked on the doors of the JD(S) as well as the then Chief Minister N. Dharam Singh and not the other way round. “We are not in the habit of going to someone’s door to secure power,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/r42kro/article30637779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGJDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bjp-will-not-accept-you-as-equals-kumaraswamy-to-lingayats/article30637780.ece

He also defended his controversial remarks against the minority community and said, “They vote for other parties but come to us for packages”. On Tuesday, he had even accused Muslims of storing weapons in mosques.

The MLA told reporters at Suttur in Mysuru district that be it Congress or Janata Dal (Secular) leaders and their followers, those opposing the CAA were all traitors.

He attacked the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and said the latter conducted a caste-based enumeration of the population and tried to divide society by offering separate religion status for Lingayats.

A large number of students from various educational institutions participated in the programme and paid tributes to the Netaji statue installed at the Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) office premises here. They also took out a procession with a portrait of Subhas Chandra Bose through major roads of the city.

Later, addressing a public meeting at Kadapa Maidan, AIDYO president Ramanjanappa Aldalli spoke about the life and works of Bose and his role in the freedom struggle. He said Bose chose to dedicate his life to the cause of the nation despite passing the coveted Indian Civil Services (ICS), which was a rare feat in those days. “He not only fought for freedom, but also had a vision for a new India. It is unfortunate that India lost its son before independence,” he said.

He said Bose dreamt of creating a society that assured equality and adopted secular principles, but this is yet to be realised. After 70 years of independence, once again society is facing a battle of religion and caste, which has occupied centre stage in politics now, Mr. Aldalli said. “People are being suppressed and political castles are being built on them,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/youngsters-pay-tribute-to-netaji-in-dharwad/article30637542.ece

156,2020/01/24,JK Tyre to increase R&D investment in Mysuru,"JK Tyre & Industries will invest over ₹100 crore in addition to the ₹200 crore already pumped into its Research and Development (R&D) centre in Mysuru.

The Raghupati Singhania Centre of Excellence (RPSCOE), inaugurated in 2018, is known as the company’s global technology centre and there are plans to procure additional equipment to ramp up R&D infrastructure to enhance its testing and product development capabilities.

V.K. Misra, technical director, JK Tyre & Industries, said on Wednesday that the country was set to move towards a star rating system for the tyre industry and the company was upgrading the R&D centre so that it is technology-ready when the rating system rolls out. The rating system is being pushed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency and Petroleum Conservation Research Association and the ratings will reflect the fuel-saving property or efficiency of product.

Mr. Misra said the R&D centre in Mysuru will have state-of-the-art tools for tyre analysis. In future, all tyres will have star rating, and hence the emphasis on R&D and upgrade of facilities, Mr. Misra said, pointing out that the firm invests 1% to 1.5% of its total turnover on R&D.

R&D has also helped develop tubeless tyres for trucks with higher fuel efficiency while there is also development of tyres for the electric vehicle segment which is still in the nascent stage in India but poised for growth. “We are technology-ready to provide tyres for the EV segment and have offered the new tyres to manufacturers engaged in development of EVs like Mahindra and Nissan,” Mr. Misra said.

The ongoing R&D for EV has spin-off benefits deployed for conventional tyres as well, according to Mr. Misra, who said t the company has developed a new product with “fuel saver technology’’ that offers 8% higher fuel efficiency. “We did tests last year and this data is based on actual tests. The same is being adopted for tubeless tyres as well,” he said.

Mr. Misra said Mysuru’s R&D establishment was a centralised centre with 180 people and was poised for expansion. Mysuru was selected for the centre as the company has three plants, besides there also being a conducive atmosphere and ambience for research and creativity, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uua3im/article30640575.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23MYSJKTYRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jk-tyre-to-increase-rd-investment-in-mysuru/article30637493.ece
157,2020/01/24,‘Anti-social activities up because of previous governments in Karnataka’,"Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan has blamed the previous governments in the State for the increase in “anti-social activities” and attributed it to the withdrawal of cases against various outfits.

He was speaking to presspersons during his tour of Mysuru district on Thursday.

In his reply to a question on the spurt in violence in the State, as evident from the attack on MLA Tanveer Sait and other incidents, Mr. Ashwath Narayan said the previous government had withdrawn the cases filed against elements responsible for violent incidents. “Such forces have gained in strength and influence now. But the BJP government has initiated measures to curb their activities and has sent a proposal to the Centre to get them banned,” he said, without naming any outfits.

The Deputy CM also said the intelligence apparatus has been strengthened and pre-emptive action initiated to foil anti-social activities. The government will leave no stone unturned to uproot the forces fomenting violence and anti-social activities, he said.

When asked if explosive materials were freely available in Karnataka, as one was recently placed at Mangaluru airport and is suspected to have been used in an attack that injured Mr. Harris, Mr. Ashwath Narayan said some explosives are diverted in stealth from industries which have permission to use them. But the government will tighten the mechanism to prevent their misuse, he added.

He also reacted sharply to the statement of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on the Mangaluru airport case that the government may go slow on the investigation as it involved a non-Muslim. “As a former Chief Minister, he should speak with a sense of responsibility and not make loose comments which do not carry any weight. He also should not try to mislead the public.”

Activists led by Maruti Manpade of Communist Party of India (Marxist), Maula Mulla of CPI, Muslim community leader Asgar Chulbul and others garlanded a statue of the Netaji at Humnabad Base in the city and declared that they would not disclose any information for NPR or furnish any documents for NRC.

“CAA, NRC and NPR are meant to divide the country along the lines of religion. We have formally launched a peaceful civil disobedience movement today by declaring that we will not provide any information and documents for NRC and NPR. We will go to people in urban and rural areas and mobilise their support. Our struggle continues till the Union government repeals CAA and drops the idea of NRC and NPR,” Mr. Manpde said.

Terming CAA a draconian law, Mr. Chulbul said the Act violates the very foundations of the Constitution. “Article 14 of the Indian Constitution says that everyone is equal before the law. None can be discriminated agains along the lines of socio-economic status or cultural identity. The CAA, however, offers citizenship on the basis of religion and is, thus, a gross violation of the Constitution. CAA has been introduced to tear apart the secular fabric of the country.

The Cabinet expansion has been delayed already. The Chief Minister should not delay it any further. If he expands his Cabinet, there will be effective governance,” he said. However, Mr. Jarkiholi added, if Mr. Yediyurappa attempts a Cabinet expansion, he is sure to leave out some MLAs and leaders, and that could affect the government.

The decision on the fresh appointment comes in the light of allegations that Mr. Rama Murthy, during his over two-year tenure as the Principal Coordinator, did not come up with any reports on the issue and was also not attending proceedings in the Supreme Court pertaining to the Cauvery dispute, and at the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal. The Chief Engineer of the Water Resources Development Organisation, which is part of Water Resources department, in a letter to the Irrigation secretary in September, 2019, highlighted this while recommending the termination of his services.

161,2020/01/24,Stop expansion work on commercial Karwar port: HC,"The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday not only directed the State government to stop, until further orders, all construction activities related to the development of commercial Karwar port at Baithkol village in Uttara Kannada district under the Sagar Mala project, but also asked it to restore the beach, which was levelled to reach the proposed area for constructing a breakwater, to its original condition.

A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar, passed the interim order on a PIL petition by the Baithkol Bandharu Nirashrithara Yantrikrut Dhoni Meenugarara Sahakara Sangha Niyamitha, an association of fishermen.

No final order

The Bench also directed the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) not to pass a final order on an application by the State Department of Ports and Inland Water seeking Consent for Establishment (CFE) of a breakwater till the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SLEIAA) considers a communication by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change.

The Ministry in July, 2019, forwarded a plea, for withdrawing the Environment Clearance granted to the project, to the SLEIAA.

The Bench directed the SLEIAA to take a decision on the representation based on the Ministry’s communication by February 26.

The Bench passed the order after noticing that preliminary works were started in violation of a specific order passed by the KSPCB on December 20, 2019, to stop all the works on the project till the CFE is granted.

The Bench also observed that the government, prima facie, had breached a condition imposed in the EC that the CFE should be obtained from the KSPCB. The preliminary works started without obtaining CFE, when the application for the CFE was submitted only on January 16, 2020.

‘High-handedness’

Counsel for the government contended that the preliminary works were within the limits of exiting the port area to reach the proposed breakwater area.

But, the Bench pointed out that, from the photographs produced in the petition, the beach was levelled, and termed as “high-handedness” the government’s action to continue the works, despite a specific communication from the KSPCB’s Environmental Officer to stop all construction activities till the CFE is granted.

The government should have respected the KSPCB’s order to stop all work, the Bench observed.

162,2020/01/24,DC recommends bifurcation of Ballari; sends proposal to govt.,"S.S. Nakul, Ballari Deputy Commissioner, has sent a proposal to the State government recommending the bifurcation of Ballari district.

B.S. Anand Singh, former Minister and BJP MLA, who took the lead in the demand for the bifurcation of the district, has been arguing for carving out a new Vijayanagar district from Ballari. However, a section of the Congress and the BJP leaders had opposed the move strongly.

Speaking to presspersons here on Thursday, Revenue Minister R. Ashok said that the Deputy Commissioner’s recommendation will be discussed with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and later placed before the State Cabinet for a final decision.

The proposed new district is likely to have the taluks of Hosapete, Hagaribommanahalli, Kottur, Siruguppa, and Hadagali.

In October, 2019, the government deferred a decision on the bifurcation of Ballari, as elected legislators from the district strongly opposed the proposal at a meeting chaired by Mr. Yediyurappa.

164,2020/01/24,Thiruvabharanam brought back to Pandalam,"The sacred jewellery Thiruvabharanam was brought back to the Pandalam Palace from Sabarimala in a ceremonial procession on Friday morning.

The procession carrying the Thiruvabharanam set off from the Sabarimala Sannidhanam after the closure of the Ayyappa temple on Tuesday morning.

It halted at the Laha Sathram, Kakkattu-koickal Dharma Sastha temple at Perinadu, and at Aranmula on the nights of Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday respectively.

The procession was escorted by R. Pradeepkumar Varma, representative of the Pandalam Palace, along with a company of Armed Police, Devaswom guards, and officials.

165,2020/01/24,Man killed after objecting to soil excavation from his property,"A 39-year old Gulf-returnee was allegedly murdered using a soil excavator at Kattakada during the early hours of Friday when he objected to the removal of soil from his land by a group of people. While the driver of the excavator was arrested within a few hours of the gruesome incident, at least five more accused are yet to be caught.

Sangeeth, of Sreemangalam house in Ambalathinkala, near Kattakada, succumbed to injuries after being knocked down using the bucket of the excavator during his futile attempt to prevent the gang from escaping before the police could reach the spot. The incident occurred around 1.30 a.m.

According to the police, Sangeeth used to sell soil from his property for constructing various infrastructure in the area, including those by the Forest Department.

Undesignated area

While Sangeeth’s wife Sangeetha had initially presumed the excavation to be undertaken for a project of the Forest Department, she sensed something amiss when the gang began to remove soil from an undesignated area. She soon alerted Sangeeth, who was in their nearby poultry farm.

Sangeeth rushed to the spot and questioned the drivers of the tipper lorry and the excavator.

Alarmed over the land owner seeking police assistance, the duo alerted a few others who rushed to the spot. While the gang demanded that they be permitted to leave the premises, Sangeeth blocked the entrance pathway using his car.

While the gang managed to remove the tipper by breaking down a portion of the compound wall, the driver of the excavator knocked down Sangeeth, who attempted to thwart the escape along with one of his neighbours.

Despite being rushed to a private hospital at Kattakada and later to the Government Medical College Hospital here, Sangeeth’s life could not be saved.

While local residents managed to seize a motorcycle that purportedly belonged to a member of the gang, the police later seized the excavator that was found abandoned nearby.

One surrenders

Shortly after the police launched their probe, the excavator driver, Vijin, 29, of Choondupalaka, near Kattakada, surrendered. The police have intensified the search for the other accused, two of whom have been identified as Uthaman and Saju.

According to Nedumangad Dy.SP Stuart Keeler, the attack was not a premeditated one. He pointed out that Sangeeth had permitted the same gang to excavate soil from the area in the past for various works.

Sangeeth, whose body is kept in the mortuary of the Government Medical College Hospital, is survived by his wife and two children, Sreehari, 6, and Sangeerthana, three-and-a-half.

Condemning the incident, Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala demanded a comprehensive probe into the incident. He also called for steps to rein in the nefarious activities by the soil mafia that operated in various parts of the State.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/man-killed-after-objecting-to-soil-excavation-from-his-property/article30646967.ece

At Kuttiyarvalley, where the government had allotted five cents each to the landless estate workers for building houses under the LIFE Mission scheme, the delay in accepting the land tax had created problems as the payment of tax is mandatory for signing the agreement with the grama panchayat to get the benefit under the scheme. The Minister said that 1,500 more title deeds would be issued at Kuttiyarvalley within a time frame.

There were separate stalls for issuing title deeds under various categories.

The Minister appreciated the officials of the Revenue Department for their tireless effort in completing the work on time.

It further directed that periodic inspections be carried out in schools, with or without notice, so that the orders are abided by.

The directive was issued by a Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Mani Kumar and Justice Shaji P. Chaly. The court passed the directive on a writ filed by Johny Cyriac, a Kochi-based doctor.

Fatigue and pain

Referring to scientific studies, he cited fatigue, muscle strain, back pain, distortion of the spine’s natural curves, rounding of the shoulders, poor body posture and short attention spans as among the effects of heavy school bags.

It also causes cervical and lumber pain during later years. He said the weight of school bags would be ideal if it is less than 10% of a child’s body weight. States like Telangana and Maharashtra had successfully reduced the weight of school bags.

Students should be encouraged to repack their bags every day and avoid carrying unnecessary articles and books. Schools should ensure adequate supply of safe drinking water so that students need not bring water bottles. The Principal and teachers too could consume this water and regular quality checks must be done.

170,2020/01/24,30-member J&K team visits Eraviperoor,"A 30-member team from Jammu Kashmir (J&K) that has been working for the cause of the common people has visited Eraviperoor grama panchayat in Thiruvalla taluk as part of its mission to learn the working models of local self-government institutions on Wednesday.

The team of retired Armed Forces personnel, led by Major Shravan, selected Eraviperoor for its two-day visit and case study in view of the local body’s excellent performance over the past nine years. Eraviperoor panchayat vice president N. Rajeev had visited J&K to take classes on the self-governance model in Kerala a year ago.

National award

The CPI(M)-led panchayat had bagged the prestigious National Award for Public Administration from Prime Minister Narendra Modi five years ago.

The J&K team visited the Community Health Centre at Othera, hitech anganwady, vegetable nursery, Ayruvedic hospital, Eraviperoor rice mill, cloth bag making unit, etc., in the panchayat limits on Wednesday.

The Community Health Centre (CHC) attached to the Health Department at Othera in Eraviperoor grama panchayat has bagged the Kayalap Award for best CHC in Pathanamthitta district in 2017.

The award has been instituted by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for promoting cleanliness, hygiene and infection control practices at public health-care facilities.

The health centre at Othera is the first of its kind in the State to get ISO certification in 2015, besides winning the government’s Arogya Puraskar in 2014.

Sayam Prabha

The panchayat has also launched the Sayam Prabha project two years ago, extending a helping hand to all its senior citizens.

Eraviperoor houses 3,008 senior citizens above the age of 60 years and all of them, irrespective of their caste, religion or economic status, have been brought to the protective umbrella of the Sayam Prabha social welfare scheme, says Mr. Rajeev, who is the brains behind the project.

171,2020/01/24,"All hero, minimal substance","In the opening sequence of Shylock is hidden perhaps the biggest secret about the movie. It all begins from a film shooting set. Producer Prathapa Varma (Kalabhavan Shajon) who has borrowed a large amount from Boss (Mammootty), a moneylender, has failed to return it on time. He has been avoiding the lender, not even picking his calls.

The director, of the movie within the movie, has set up the scene to shoot the hero introduction. Mid-way through the shot, the hero of our movie, the Shylockian lender, arrives in style, in his Rolls Royce to confront the producer. With the producer failing to return the money, Boss and his men kidnap the director.

Borrowed lines

Much of Shylock makes one wonder whether a scene similar to this happened in the film’s set too, for it is a superstar mass movie that can be made on autopilot, without a director’s needless intervention. Even half of the superstar’s lines are borrowed from other movies, both Malayalam and Tamil, in the name of ‘paying tribute.’ This is then explained away as his habit, due to his childhood dream of becoming a film star. Or maybe, the dialogue writers were kidnapped too.

Director Ajai Vasudev, who has worked only with Mammootty in his film career, having previously made Rajadhiraja and Masterpiece, does not even attempt to bring anything new to the table. Milking the star’s style and mass fan base is the only agenda. The first half is sprinkled with quite a few scenes that could send diehard fans into a tizzy.

Mammootty’s Boss is a playful, villainous hero, a cross between some of his famous past roles. Almost all the other characters pale into irrelevance, as nothing here happens without Boss. Even the sidekicks are only there to crack jokes and provide intro speeches before his arrival, with Boss having to do all the hard work of fighting.

The slight fun element of the first half is lost post-interval as the movie shifts to a lengthy flashback, which gets over only when the movie is about to end. This flashback, set in Tamil Nadu, has a done-to-death story, which would serve as the base for revenge.

The star worship reaches its peak during an outdated ‘item song’ filmed inside a dance bar. As soon as Boss arrives in style, and sits imperiously on a sofa, the three dancers surround him, singing in his praise, calling him a ‘megastar.’ Not satisfied, the director plays out a clip from Padayappa, of Ramya Krishnan’s character praising Rajini’s evergreen style, meant to imply our star here.

If only they had worked half as hard on the script as they did on the star worship, this movie would have made a better tribute to their favourite star, than this hollow piece of work.

172,2020/01/24,A proud moment for IISU,"When the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) unveiled ‘Vyommitra’ — the humanoid that will fly aboard test missions ahead of the crewed Gaganyaan mission — earlier this week in Bengaluru, it was a big moment for the ISRO Inertial Systems Unit (IISU) here at Vattiyurkavu.

A key ISRO facility, IISU was responsible for the design, development, and integration of Vyommitra.

“Basically, it mimics an astronaut. We have been working on the prototype for the past nine to ten months. The model that will be used for the first test flight is expected to be operational in another nine months,” IISU director Sam Dayala Dev told The Hindu.

First trial flight

ISRO plans to have the first trial flight from Sriharikota by the end of this year. In structure, Vyommitra is a “half-humanoid,” in the sense that she — the robot astronaut is a ‘female’ — lacks lower limbs. The choice of gender had been a “spontaneous decision” by the IISU team, according to Mr. Dev.

During the mission, the humanoid is expected to provide ISRO information on the actual conditions inside the crew module.

While Vyommitra is IISU’s first tryst with a humanoid, ISRO facility has carried out work in certain aspects of the project, including the artificial intelligence aspects and robotic arms.

The IISU, which designs and develops navigational systems for ISRO launch vehicles, had special teams working on the humanoid. Mr. Sam Dayala Dev had chaired the national-level committee set up by ISRO chairman K. Sivan for the project. The IISU had gone to work on the design after the panel, which included professors from IITs and other premier scientific institutes, made recommendations regarding the configuration.

Core team

A core team at IISU was supported by experts drawn from various IISU entities as well IITs and other institutions, including the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST) at Valiyamala.

Simulating physical movements and facial expressions proved a challenge in the humanoid’s development. “The next was with respect to artificial intelligence. We cannot fly a huge computer aboard the rocket. So we are developing a computer that will be integrated in the torso of the humanoid,” the IISU director said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gn2htq/article30650319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tvVyomitra,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-proud-moment-for-iisu/article30646917.ece
173,2020/01/24,Cong. urged to cooperate with LDF’s human chain,"Left Democratic Front (LDF) convener A. Vijayaraghavan has called upon the Congress and its allies to cooperate with the human chain to be organised by the front from Parassala to Kasaragod on Sunday, demanding the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Mr. Vijayaraghavan told reporters here on Friday that a large number of people who were backing the United Democratic Front (UDF) had come forward to join the human chain, but the Congress in the State did not profess a passion for the values of the freedom movement. When the nation was facing a threat to its integrity, a united resistance had become imperative to force the Centre to repeal the Act, he said. The Congress was not responding positively to such moves, Mr. Vijayaraghavan added.

Taking a cue from the joint protests organised by the two fronts and also resolution passed unanimously by the Assembly, other States too had come out against the Centre, but the State Congress leadership was maintaining a nonchalant attitude, he said.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) Polit Bureau member S. Ramachandran Pillai will be the first link of the chain in Kasaragod, to be followed by Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan and others.

Billed as the first international chess tournament to be held on a houseboat, the mascot of Kerala Tourism, the six-day tourney will be held in a ‘Spice Route luxury houseboat,’ which will cruise along the backwaters, blending chess and tourism and promoting Kerala globally.

40 players to take part

The event is on the lines of the Chess Train Tournament being hosted by the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, Poland and Slovakia since 2013. Around 40 chess players, including 10 from the Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates, will fly down to Alappuzha. The tourney is being organised by Oriental Chess Moves Trust, an independent forum headed by N.R. Anil Kumar, a former member of the Indian Chess Olympic team and an International Master in correspondence chess, along with Joe Parappilly and P. Manojkumar, former international players.

“A visit to Prague in October to see the Chess Train Tourney inspired us to commence this initiative. Travel advisories by various countries have reduced the number of participants though we were ready for 100 players. We want to make it an annual event,” Mr. Anil Kumar told The Hindu.

Pavel Matocha, a key organiser of the Chess Train Tournament will also be in attendance. Kerala Tourism is extending support to the event as a partner.

The luxury houseboat had hosted Netherlands King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima in October last. The vessel, which can accommodate 60 persons at a time, will this time resemble a chess tournament venue.

The rest have no symptoms but have been advised home quarantine and to alert the local health administration in the event they develop any symptoms like fever.

One person each has been isolated in Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta, Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode and two in Ernakulam. None of them are sick but have been isolated as per the protocol as the situation with nCoV is still evolving, Dr. Fettle said.

Three types of samples

Three types of samples have been collected from these persons -- throat/nasal swabs, deep respiratory secretions and blood samples -- and have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, which is currently the sole testing centre. However, by February second week, testing facilities are expected to be available at NIV’s Alapuzha unit,

Meanwhile, with China closing down Wuhan and imposing a total travel ban, there are reports that some 20 Malayali medical students who were planning to head home during the Lunar New Year holidays are stranded in the city.

Labour Minister T. P.

178,2020/01/24,KPCC reconstituted with 12 vice presidents,"After months of intra-party wrangling in the State unit, the Congress high command on Friday nominated a 47-member panel of office-bearers to lead the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC).

In a communique, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary K.C. Venugopal said party president Sonia Gandhi “has approved the proposal of the appointment of PCC office-bearers of Kerala with immediate effect. The remaining posts of PCC secretaries and the executive committee will be announced before February 10,” he said.

The release makes no mention of the current status of three working presidents, namely V.D. Satheeshan, MLA, K. Sudhakaran and Kodikunnil Suresh, both MPs.

Being AICC nominees, the three are likely to hold the office until the party high command decides the posts are redundant or appoints others in their stead.

Mr. Satheeshan had earlier requested the party high command not to consider him for the post. The AICC had earlier signalled that it preferred its MLAs and MPs to voluntarily stay away from crucial party positions to focus more on their constituencies.

The high command had reconstituted the KPCC after much parleys with top State leaders. It had strived to accommodate various factional, communal and regional interest in the selection of the panel.

The party appeared to be acutely aware that the reconstituted KPCC required to be broad-based to sail through a tumultuous period fraught with electoral challenges, tempestuous agitations centred around the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and increased social polarisation.

P.C. Vishnunath, a confidante of former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy, topped the list of 12 vice presidents. The other notables in the list are Padmaja Venugopal, Joseph Vazhackan, T. Siddique, Sarathchandra Prasad, K.C. Rosakutty and Mohan Sankar, son of former Chief Minister R. Sankar, Sooranad Rajasekharan, K.P. Dhanapalan, C.P. Muhammad, Manvila Radhakrishnan and Ezhukone Narayanan. The AICC has appointed K.K. Kochumuhammad as treasurer.

The reconstituted KPCC has 34 general secretaries. A. Palode Ravi, A.A. Shukkoor, Thampanoor Ravi, K.P. Anil Kumar, Manacaud Suresh, Jyothi Kumar Chamakala, and Mathew Kuzhalnadan are the prominent names on the list.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kpcc-reconstituted-with-12-vice-presidents/article30645897.ece
179,2020/01/24,MPs endorse govt. stance on NPR,"Members of Parliament from Kerala have endorsed the State government’s decision not to cooperate with the National Population Register (NPR).

Addressing a meeting held here as a prelude to the budget session of Parliament on Friday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government would take steps to avert confusion among the public and political parties about the Census and NPR. Mr. Vijayan sought their intervention for including the proposals mooted by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac in the Union budget to tide over the financial crisis gripping the State.

The State had also demanded a special consideration in the wake of floods that lashed the State. The government had demanded the Centre to raise the borrowing limit to fund its rebuilding activities, increase the minimum support price for rubber, announce an international Ayurvedic research institute in Kannur, sanction an AIIMS for Kerala, make additional investments in Cochin Shipyard and FACT and such others. The State has not yet received the GST compensation of ₹1,600 crore for August and September last. The move to privatise BPCL needs to be halted.

The government has submitted an estimate to the Centre for rebuilding the roads damaged in the floods and demanded an additional assistance of ₹10 lakh for each km from the National Disaster Response Fund for doing the work. The Centre should also waive the bill slammed on the State government for providing ration rice from its pool for the flood victims. Mr. Vijayan wanted the MPs to mount pressure on the Centre for securing a decision in favour of the State.

He urged the MPs to persuade the Centre to help implement the recommendations of the Loka Kerala Sabha, mainly for rehabilitating the repatriates in accordance with their skills. The MPs should also persuade the Centre to provide financial support for the various projects in the railway sector.

The MPs should intervene to make the Centre order a probe into the death of Keralites’ in Kathmandu and secure due compensation for their families. An intervention from the Centre was imperative for conducting a thorough inquiry and getting a compensation for the victims’ kin, he said.

Mr. Isaac, Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran, and Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty represented the government.

Benoy Viswam, Kodikunnil Suresh, K. Muraleedharan, E.T. Mohammed Basheer, Benny Behanan, A.M. Arif, P.V. Abdul Wahab, Jose K. Mani, N.K.

180,2020/01/24,Drive against houseboats flouting norms,"A day after a houseboat carrying tourists caught fire near Pathiramanal island, the authorities on Friday launched a drive against houseboats flouting norms.

As per the direction of District Police Chief K.M. Tomy, a police team conducted searches in houseboats. Officials said that a combined drive involving the police, Ports Department, Fire and Rescue Services Department and Tourism Department would be held on Saturday.

On Thursday, 16 people, including 13 tourists and three crew members, had a miraculous escape after the houseboat they were cruising caught fire.

Following the incident, the Ports Department, the licensing authority, launched a probe. Officials said the houseboat was found to be operating since 2013 without a registration and mandatory licence and clearances.

Alappuzha port officer Capt. Hari Achutha Warrier said they had recorded the statements of houseboat owner Sigimon C.P. and srank Ajeeesh M.M. “On Thursday, the houseboat operated without a driver. We have decided to cancel the licence of the srank. As the boat was operated without registration and licences, action will be taken against the owner. The action against the owner will be decided by the police,” Mr. Warrier said.

Six women, two babies, a four-year-old boy, and four men from Kannur set off from Kumarakom in a double-decker houseboat named Oceana around 11.30 a.m. When the boat reached Pathiramanal around 1.15 p.m., a blaze started in the kitchen and soon spread to other parts of the vessel.

According to officials, the boat caught fire in an area with sandbars. The passengers and the crew jumped onto a sandbar where the water level was 5 feet. This helped them save their lives.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/drive-against-houseboats-flouting-norms/article30645378.ece
181,2020/01/24,Mosques to hoist national flag on Republic Day,"Mosques in the State for the first time will hoist the national flag as well as read out the preamble of the Indian Constitution on Republic Day on January 26.

Already the Kerala State Wakf Board has sent circulars to all the mahal committees and institutions under its jurisdiction to hoist the national flag, read out the preamble and take the pledge to protect the Constitution.

Crucial period

“We have decided to go ahead with the programme in view of the country going through a crucial period. Of course, the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act [CAA] and anti-NPR are raging everywhere. We cannot remain aloof from the protests,” T.K. Hamsa, chair of the Wakf Board, who is also the CPI (M) State committee member, said.

He told The Hindu on Friday that the minorities especially the Muslim community were feeling insecure about denial of citizenship. “Such events would promote national integration in this unpleasant political situation,” Mr. Hamsa said.

About 10,000 mosques function under the Wakf Board. The circular has also instructed the mahal committees to adhere to the instruction to unfurl the national flag at 8.30 a.m. in accordance with the stipulations adopted by State government and other departments. A copy of the Preamble of the Indian Constitution has also been sent with the circular.

However, some mahal committees have chalked out plans even before the Wakf Board came out with such as circular and are organising bigger events including talks of religious heads. “We have invited Major Devanandan, NCC Group Headquarters, Kozhikode, to hoist the national flag,” P.M. Abdul Kareem, secretary of the Pattala Palli, set up by Tipu Sultan, at Mananchira.

Besides, writer Alankode Leelakrishnan will deliver the Republic Day message.

Swami Viswa Bhadrananda Shakti Bodhi, Prof. Hussain Madavoor, Fr. Thomas Parakulangara and Dr. Jamaludhin Farooqi will speak on the occasion. “People from all sections have been invited so as to promote the spirit of brotherhood and enforce camaraderie among sections of the people,” Mr. Kareem said.

Similar ceremonies have been planned at the Mohiudeen Palli near the Palayam market as well. “Normally mosques do not engage in such ceremonial activities on Republic Day though madrasas hoist the national flag. But the need of the hour is to protect the constitutional rights of the people,M.C. Mayin Haji, leader of the Indian Union Muslim League and Muthawalli representative of the Wakf Board, said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mosques-to-hoist-national-flag-on-republic-day/article30645312.ece
182,2020/01/24,Case against BJP MP for causing communal enmity,"The police here on Friday registered a case against BJP Lok Sabha member from Udupi-Chickmagalur Shobha Karandlaje for spreading communal hatred in society in the name of a false incident. A case was also registered against four workers of the Seva Bharati for causing communal division.

The cases were registered at the Kuttippuram police station under Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code. The section deals with promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony.

Ms. Karandlaje had tweeted that Hindus of Kuttippuram grama panchayat in Malappuram were denied water supply as they supported the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). She further tweeted that Kerala was taking baby steps to become another Kashmir. Her tweet, shared widely across the country by the BJP and its sympathisers, had kicked up a row, bringing a Muslim family of Payinkannur in Kuttippuram in the Sangh Parivar’s line of fire.

The police conducted an investigation on the basis of a complaint filed by lawyer K.R. Subhash Chandran and found that the allegations of denying water to Hindus for supporting the CAA were false. “It was found to be a false allegation made with the intention of creating communal embitterment,” said District Superintendent of Police U. Abdul Kareem.

BJP district president Ravi Thelath criticised the police for taking action against Ms. Karandlaje. He said it exposed the true nature of the police. “The BJP knows how to handle it,” he said.

‘‘A case is taken against the Seva Bharati workers who provided water. They were providing water and not creating any communal division,” he said.

But the police said the case was not for providing water, but for spreading enmity. The banner used by the Seva Bharati on the tanker they used for water supply had read: “Seva Bharati's help for the Cherukunnu colony residents who have been denied drinking water for supporting CAA.”

The State police will write to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla informing him of the criminal case being charged against Ms. Karandlaje. The police cannot arrest an MP without the permission of the Speaker.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/case-against-bjp-mp-for-causing-communal-enmity/article30645154.ece
183,2020/01/24,Centre’s stand may help power sector in Kerala,"The Centre’s decision to accord clearance to all large hydropower projects will work to the advantage of the State which is facing a perennial power deficit.

Power sector sources told The Hindu that the Union Power Ministry and the Ministry of Environment and Forests have taken a liberal view in giving clearance for large hydroelectric projects mainly in tune with the global practice to lay accent on green energy and address the problems thrown up by climate change.

The shift from a regimented approach has come as a great relief for Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) that is tapping all available options to bridge the yawning demand-supply gap.

Of late, the board has ventured into a project to generate 1,000 MW from various solar models by 2021. Since sun is a very truant option, the board would need a strong hydroelectric source as a backup, sources say.

Sustained power generation from wind and solar is impossible. Fluctuations in the intensity of sunlight and speed of wind will affect the rate of generation.

Calibrated and sustained power generation is possible only from a hydroelectric station. Even thermal stations cannot be operated in the switch-on and switch-off mode to generate power in fits and starts. Hence, more hydel projects have become imperative for the State, especially when it is attempting at renewable options in the next two years, sources say. The Centre is understood to have decided to clear all applications for large hydroelectric projects, irrespective of their capacity. Hydroelectric projects have also been bracketed with renewable energy options. Also, power purchase from new large hydroprojects has been made obligatory.The State government had to shelve major project proposals such as Athirappilly, even after getting all mandatory clearances, in the face of stiff resistance from environmentalists. But the shift in Central stance has again offered a glimmer of hope for having new hydroelectric projects, sources say.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nge1w7/article30772475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tv-powercol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/centres-stand-may-help-power-sector/article30644931.ece
184,2020/01/24,"Surya Siddhanta the basis of space studies, says Governor","The ancient Indian treatise Surya Siddhanta served as the basis for ‘all space studies’ in Europe, Governor Arif Mohammad Khan said on Friday, pointing out that Indians have become oblivious to their traditions.

''We have become so unfamiliar with our ethos. The result is that scientific references in our books have been reduced to myth in our minds,’’ the Governor said, presenting the Sree Chithira Thirunal National Award 2019 to K. Sivan, Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).

Surya Siddhanta, a text on astronomy written in Sanskrit, was presented in the court of Al-Mansur, the second Caliph of the Abbasid dynasty, along with certain other texts. Fascinated by its content, the Caliph had ordered the Arab scholar and astronomer Muhammad Al-Fazari to get it translated into Arabic, Mr. Khan said.

The then ruler of Spain, who was not on good terms with Al-Mansur, had obtained a copy of the translation by paying a huge bribe. ''From Spain that book was translated, over a period of time, into almost all European languages. And it is admitted that this Indian book is the basis, the start, of all space studies of Europe,'' he said.

The country is grateful to scientists such as Mr. Sivan and former ISRO chairman G. Madhavan Nair (who was present at the function) not just for what they accomplished for it, but also for reviving the country’s traditions, the Governor said.

Former Ambassador T. P. Sreenivasan, who chairs the Sree Chithira Thirunal Trust which institutes the annual award; former State Police Chief Jacob Punnoose, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre director S.

186,2020/01/24,Muslim family’s decision to discontinue water supply to Dalit colony kicks up row in Kerala,"The decision of a Muslim family to discontinue water supply to the residents of a Dalit colony near Valanchery in the district has kicked up a row, with the Sangh Parivar linking the issue with the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

District authorities said here on Friday that it was a personal issue and had nothing to do with the CAA.

The BJP alleged that the residents of the Cherukunnu SC colony were denied drinking water after some members of the colony attended the party’s Janajagratha Sadas in support of the CAA.

The issue assumed wider and murkier proportions when BJP MP Shobha Karandlaje tweeted saying that Malappuram was taking baby steps to become a Pakistan.

The Muslim family in question denied the allegation, saying that the water supply was discontinued because of technical issues.

The water supply system of the panchayat to the Dalit colony had not been functioning for about a year. Several households at the colony have been depending on the benevolence of the Muslim family in the neighbourhood for water.

Local residents said that the timing of the discontinuation of the water supply coincided with the CAA protests, and it was used as a weapon to further the hatred between two communities.

Revenue authorities said there were working to re-establish water supply to the colony.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kc7drk/article30643395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24-Shobha-tweetjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/muslim-familys-decision-to-discontinue-water-supply-to-dalit-colony-kicks-up-row-in-kerala/article30641789.ece
187,2020/01/24,97% coverage in Pulse Polio drive,"Kerala attained an overall coverage of 97% in the Pulse Polio drive conducted last Sunday, when 24.5 lakh children under the age of five were administered oral polio vaccine, as part of a national strategy.

The final figure of 97% was arrived at by the Health department after the mop-up rounds were completed.

In Malappuram

The department considered it a major achievement that it could attain a coverage of 91% in Malappuram district where vaccine hesitancy has always been an issue affecting immunisation cover.

After Sunday, health workers visited houses on two consecutive days with the vaccine to administer it to children who had missed it.

The Pulse Polio coverage (in %) achieved in districts are as follows: Thiruvananthapuram (104), Kollam (99), Pathanamthitta (94), Alappuzha (95), Kottayam (94), Idukki (103), Ernakulam (103), Thrissur (101), Palakkad (99), Malappuram (91), Kozhikode (95), Wayanad (99), Kannur (96), and Kasaragod (94).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/97-coverage-in-pulse-polio-drive/article30640396.ece
188,2020/01/24,Vaccine for cow disease arrives in Palakkad,"The vaccine against the lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cows reached here on Thursday, bringing relief to hundreds of dairy farmers in Palakkad and neighbouring districts. Animal Husbandry Department officials said the vaccine brought from Gujarat would be administered in a couple of days. When 15,000 doses have been kept aside for Thrissur, about 10,500 doses will be administered in Palakkad district.

Officials said that 1,000 vaccine doses each were being sent to Malappuram and Kasaragod districts. They said the vaccine would be administered to cows in the 42 grama panchayats in Palakkad district, where more than 600 cows were affected by LSD. Apart from Palakkad, the disease was reported from Thrissur, Malappuram, Kasaragod and Alappuzha districts also. LSD, reported first time in Kerala, is a rare viral attack that debilitates the cattle badly by reducing the milk production and affecting growth and fertility.

Although the disease was confirmed by the end of December, the government hushed it up fearing panic among the farmers. It took some time for the veterinarians in the State to identify the disease as LSD had never been reported here before. The Animal Husbandry Department had launched a door-to-door awareness campaign among the dairy farmers in the affected regions, allaying fears among the farmers.

LSD caused by Capripoxvirus is generally viewed as the animal equivalent of chickenpox that affects human beings. It takes about a week for the viral attack to subside. If neglected, the lumps on the cow’s body can rupture and cause debilitating wounds. If not treated, the wounds can invite maggots. Farmers were advised to clean the wounds and apply antibiotics.

However, lack of appetite followed by a drastic fall in milk production has caused angst among the farmers. They expressed fears that the disease, if not controlled, would seriously affect the milk production in the State at a time when the State was cruising ahead with the agenda of self-sustenance in milk production.

Unlike other viral attacks, LSD virus spreads either through fluids or through insect bites. According to Animal Husbandry officials, there is no harm in drinking the milk of an affected cow.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/zeyaa9/article30640427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tv-cowlumpy-skincol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vaccine-for-cow-disease-arrives-in-palakkad/article30640426.ece

Acting on a complaint lodged by the boy’s mother, the police booked a case against the teacher, identified as Minimol Jose. The accused has been placed under suspension by the school management, pending inquiry.

Complaint lodged

The police said the accused, a teacher at St. Xavier’s Lower Primary School at Mannarappara, allegedly assaulted the boy on Wednesday afternoon after taking him to the staff room. The boy later disclosed the episode to his grandmother, who approached the school authorities with a complaint. Later, they also lodged a complaint with the local police and Childline.

Though the school authorities tendered an unconditional apology and asked the teacher to go on leave, the incident snowballed into a controversy after Democratic Youth Federation of India workers staged a protest in front of the school on Thursday, demanding the teacher’s arrest.

Talks with protesters

Kaduthuruthy District Education Officer (DEO) Saudamini, who visited the school on Thursday morning, held discussions with the schools authorities, PTA members, and the protesters. Later, the official also visited the victim’s residence and collected his statement.

On confirming the teacher’s involvement in the incident, a recommendation to place her under suspension was sent to the school management.

192,2020/01/24,"‘Sponge city’, sharing the Shenzhen experience","The ‘sponge city’ concept can prove useful to Kerala cities such as Kochi for tackling floods, but it should be borne in mind that this is also a gradual process where benefits are reaped over a period of time, Sun Xiang, senior engineer/ project manager, Shenzhen Water Planning and Design Institute, China, has said.

Mr. Sun presented the concept at a conference on ‘Policies and strategies for flood management’ organised by the Water Resources Department here on Thursday. On Wednesday, he toured Kochi accompanied by department officials.

Southern Chinese city Shenzhen was among the first of 30 cities in China to adopt the sponge city initiative, an integrated solution which equips urban locales to effectively tackle floods and utilise rainwater efficiently. The Irrigation Department is probing whether the Chinese initiative can be adapted for Kochi, which was ravaged by the 2019 floods. “I’m not saying it can be done in two or three years. It is a gradual process, where the city becomes better and better. It is a step-by-step process just like the development in Shenzhen,” Mr. Sun said.

Shift in mindset

Strict regulations, widening the rivers, dredging canals criss-crossing the city, and better management and maintenance can help Kochi handle floods better, he said. “Shenzhen has done all of this over 10-15 years,” Mr. Sun said. An important aspect of the Shenzhen experience was the mindset shift from “fast drainage to sustainable storm water management.”

An integrated solution, the sponge city concept combines flood control, legislation, water resources management, rainwater harvesting, water purification, and governance. China launched the sponge city initiative in 2015. In 2016, 14 more cities were added to the original list of 16 cities.

Sponge city challenges for Shenzhen, which covers approximately 2,000 sq km, included tackling storm surges, typhoons, lack of water resources, and flood drainage mechanism, Mr. Sun said. Challenges were addressed in multiple stages; between 1980 and 2005 as ‘separated flood control’, in 2006 as a three-in-one concept of flood control, pollution control and landscaping; and the ‘blue line planning’ stage in 2007 where the government passed a law.

In 2013, the government published a new edition for flood control planning, which served as a master plan. The sponge city initiative was rolled out two years later.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/d9p0y0/article30637294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tvsponge,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sponge-city-sharing-the-shenzhen-experience/article30637288.ece
193,2020/01/24,Haunting tales of homeless people in poetry and music,"Inua Ellams, dramatist and poet, was 12 when his family was forced to leave Nigeria after they were threatened and his uncle went missing. Littered with poems, stories and anecdotes, Inua Ellams tells the tale of his tortuous journey to the United Kingdom from Nigeria.

An Evening with Immigrant, staged at the the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) on Thursday, is a poignant immigrant story of people without a country or a place to call home. And it is the story of the dramatist himself. “No one leaves home unless/ home is the mouth of a shark.” The show presented with poetry and music expresses the uncertainty of lives of immigrants.

Inua Ellams begins the play by reciting the lines “I come from a long line of troublemakers”. While telling his story, he keeps a suitcase by his side to remind that he has to continue his journey.

Born to Muslim father and Christian mother, Ellams left Nigeria at the age of 12. They first moved to Ireland before returning to London to work as a writer and graphic designer.

Though he is a celebrated artist and award-winning poet settled in the U.K. , Ellams is still looking for a place to call home. He has been invited to Buckingham Palace to dine with the Queen of England but refused permission by the Home Office for permanent stay. Brought by Fuel Production Limited from England, part of today’s play was documented in Ellams’ hilarious autobiographical Edinburgh Fringe First award-winning play The 14th Tale.

The theatre group Fuel Productions aims to catalyse positive change in the world by producing new live performances by inspiring theatre-makers for and with people.

Fuel was founded in 2004 and is led by Kate McGrath.

Ellams facilitates workshops in creative writing where he explores reoccurring themes in his work — Identity, Displacement and Destiny — in accessible, enjoyable ways for participants of all ages and backgrounds.

Ellam’s first play The 14th Tale was awarded a Fringe First at the Edinburgh Festival and his fourth Barber Shop Chronicles sold out two runs at the National Theatre.

194,2020/01/24,The deceit of 'Modern Love': Stranger than fiction,"Watching Modern Love, an eight-episode anthology series based on the popular New York Times weekly column, is a disorienting experience. How is it possible to be both enlightened and disappointed at once? I detested and devoured the eight episodes in less than a day. I hated that I liked these self-satisfied little New York vignettes of romantic love. There were times when I cringed and choked up at the same moment. I thought I had outgrown my cheesy Gary Marshall phase. But this feeling is a little more complicated than guilty pleasure. It has more to do with the familiarity of storytelling, than the originality of myth-building.

Stranger than fiction

Sample the vignettes: A working girl shares a trusting equation with a paternal doorman, a young tech wiz and his middle-aged profile writer exchange tales of heartbreak, a bipolar lawyer struggles with her crippling condition, a couple takes therapy at the crossroads of their ordinary marriage, an awkward first date ends in the hospital, a 21-year-old lady looks for fatherly love from her attractive old boss, a gay couple adjusts to the nomadic mother of the baby they are slated to adopt, and an old lady mourns the death of her new soul mate.

None of these characters are made up. Each of the stories is adapted from first-person pieces written by real people. The reason they are told – the reason most personal essays are published – is because their truths are stranger than fiction. They sound like movies without having to bear the burden of being movies. They sound like independent music that bears a passing resemblance to pop hits. John Carney (Once, Begin Again, Sing Street), the writer-director of four Modern Love episodes, is a man of music. He understands that cinematic dissonance – the artful juxtaposition of extraordinary sounds with ordinary images – is a charming facet of love. It fools the viewer into looking for something larger than life – happy endings, closed narratives, soaring coincidences – without really letting them forget that this is life itself.

Great expectations

As a result, all the episodes have a dated 90s rom-com vibe about them. The cinematography looks clean and packaged. The characters behave like...characters. The faces are familiar – Dev Patel, Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, Andrew Scott, Catherine Keener, Andy Garcia. Even New York looks as if Pretty Woman just wrapped its millennial-boomer schedule. It’s designed in a way that makes me expect Maggie (Cristin Milioti) to ditch her LA job offer to stay close to her guardian-angel doorman. It makes me expect both journalist Julie (Catherine Keener) and ex-flame Michael (Andy Garcia) to ditch their loveless marriages to rekindle their affair after her cover story repairs the broken romance of its subject (Dev Patel). It makes me expect handsome Jeff (Gary Carr) to understand Lexi’s (Anne Hathaway) illness and keep coming back, irrespective of her moods. It makes me expect Karla (Olivia Cooke) – the homeless and idealistic nomad – to stay back with the wealthy gay couple who adopts her baby. It makes me expect.

Modern Love, like love itself, makes us expect a movie before hitting us with a brand of life that merely inspires the movies. Quirky Maggie leaving New York anyway is not supposed to happen because it happens too often. When it does, the airy grammar of mainstream rom-com imagery is both at odds and oddly synonymous with the pragmatism of real events. The language is imaginary, but the words remain real. The look is glossily philanthropic, but the expression is comfortably misanthropic. Michael giving his marriage a second chance while Julie walks out of hers is not supposed to happen either; when it does, the series inadvertently suggests that stories are most rewarding when the reward is yet to dawn upon the writer. Lexi locating a friend instead of boyfriend is not supposed to happen; when it does, the show reveals that the means to an end can be just as satisfying as an end. When Karla continues with her hunter-gatherer existence, we hear a moving monologue about how she is perhaps the purest and most primal form of humanity.

Nothing ends the way we want it to. It just ends the way it should, like an excerpt of a longer story. Like a love ballad scored to the lyrics of a raging rap anthem. And it proves that personal essays – an art form often frowned upon for its selfish disposition – are essentially films that are unable to locate the perspective of a camera. After all, it was Carney who showed us how, not long ago, an Irish street singer left after recording (the album of) his dreams with a Czech busker girl. They made music, loved and left in a film whose title – Once – fooled us into expecting Upon A Time.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kla7qp/article30646461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Anne-Hathaway-and-Gary-Carr-in-Modern-Love-Amazon-Prime-Video-e1573788324858,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-deceit-of-modern-love-stranger-than-fiction/article30646462.ece

On Mossy Bottom Farm, Shaun and his flock are up to their old tricks much to the irritation of the sheepdog, Bitzer, who is busy putting up notices banning the sheep from practically everything.

Farmer John and Bingo, his dog, run away from an alien ship leaving their French fries behind. Shaun follows a trail of pizza crusts to find the cutest little alien. With the Ministry of Alien Detections led by stern Agent Red (who saw aliens as a little girl and was laughed at for talking about them) hot on their heels, Shaun has to help the alien get home to her parents. In the meantime, Farmer is trying to cash in on the UFO craze by setting his farm as a UFO themed park: Farmageddon.

The music composed by Tom Howe is lovely. ‘Lazy,’ the theme tune is performed by The Vaccines and Kylie Minogue, there is a remix of the series theme and an original song, ‘I Can’t Be My Old Self Forever’ by Jorja Smith.

196,2020/01/24,Judge recuses from hearing lawyer’s plea against ‘Chhapaak’ producers,"A Delhi High Court judge on Friday recused from hearing a lawyer’s plea seeking contempt proceedings against the makers of Deepika Padukone-starrer ‘Chhapaak’, saying he has worked with the petitioner-advocate.

The petition was moved by advocate Aparna Bhat who had represented acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal on whose life the movie is based.

MS. Bhat, in her plea, said the filmmakers had violated the high court’s January 11 direction to give her credit for the inputs she shared with them.

Justice A.K. Chawla said he and advocate Bhat had worked together when he was a lawyer and therefore, he would not be hearing the matter.

He directed the registry to list the case before another bench for January 27.

Justice Prathiba M. Singh had on January 11 directed the film’s director Meghna Gulzar and producer Fox Star Studios to acknowledge the advocate in the opening credits by including the line “Inputs by Ms. Aparna Bhat, the lawyer who represented Laxmi Agarwal, are acknowledged“.

The lawyer has contended that the film was screened without complying with the direction and therefore, a contempt of court proceedings be initiated against the filmmakers.

The January 11 order had come on a plea Fox Star Studios challenging a trial court’s order asking it to acknowledge the contribution of the advocate. The film was released on January 10,

The High Court had said that since the film has already been released, both internationally and in India, it should be ensured that there is no disruption in its screening.

It was directed that the film will not be shown in theatres with effect from January 15 without adding the credit line for the advocate to the digital copies.

In theatres where physical copies of the film were to be supplied by the producer, the changes had to be carried out with effect from January 18, it had said.

The film producer’s advocate had said the trial court did not hear them before passing an order and an ad-interim ex-parte injunction was passed which is unusual.

The counsel for MS. Bhat had said she had fought the case for Laxmi Agarwal pro-bono and was not seeking any publicity and she was approached by Gulzar to get some authenticity in the movie.

He had said that Mr. Bhat’s assistance was based on her communication with Gulzar that her contribution would be acknowledged.

Ms. Bhat, in her plea before the trial court, had said that despite representing Laxmi in courts for several years and helping in the making of the film, she was not given credit in the movie.

197,2020/01/24,"Director Anwar Rasheed on 'Trance' and the characters played by Fahadh Faasil, Nazriya and Gautham Menon","Success has been Anwar Rasheed’s constant companion, as director and producer. Now, he returns to direction after a six-year gap with Trance, which he has produced as well. As the Fahadh Faasil-starrer is set to release this Valentine’s Day, February 14, Anwar talks to MetroPlus about the movie, his approach to filmmaking and how Malayalam cinema has evolved.

What is Trance about?

Trance is described as a particular state of mind. It is usually associated with music. But in this movie, it applies to a different context and person. The film is about Viju Prasad, a low-key motivational trainer based in Kanyakumari, played by Fahadh. The narrative follows his growth, mental and emotional, at different phases of his life.

The audience is excited about the first outing of Fahadh and Nazriya on screen after their marriage...

Although we’ve had several celebrity couples in Malayalam cinema, none have acted together after their marriage. So Fahadh and Nazriya are an exception. We have brought in a different chemistry between the two. Nazriya’s character, Esther Lopez, will be different, unlike the bubbly and vivacious roles that she has played so far.

How did you zero in on the story?

This is the début film of our scenarist, Vincent Vadakkan, an ad-man. I was supposed to direct his story for 5 Sundarikal. But that had to be dropped because I couldn’t get the right cast. Later, when he came up with the story of Trance, I was not in a position to commit myself to the cinema because of the huge production cost involved. However, I had finalised Fahadh as the protagonist then itself. It so happened that Fahadh heard the story from Vincent and he asked me to rethink about it. The storyline had changed and Fahadh’s career was also on a high. By then, I was confident about producing it and that’s how the project started rolling.

Expectations are high with people like Resul Pookutty and Amal Neerad working in the film?

I didn’t want to compromise on anything. Sound is integral to the story, especially to create certain trance-like situations. For that, I needed the best person out there. The movie is shot in sync sound, which is not common with big commercial ventures. And I needed Amal’s craft for the movie. If it were possible, I would have worked with just him in all my movies. But that has happened only in ‘Aami’ [from 5 Sundarikal]. Perhaps, I am the only person who has seen his best works, like his diploma film. There is more to Amal than the stylish frames that viewers generally talk about.

Why were you missing in action for over six years?

I make movies at my own pace. I can’t make back-to-back projects since it takes a long time for a film to get out of my system! In fact, I am more comfortable producing films. Direction involves a lot of tension. You are making something of your own, whereas in production, someone else is doing that for you! I enjoy being a producer because that brings totality to a filmmaker and teaches a lot of things. I get a complete picture of the industry. It is exciting to see other directors at work. I am lucky to have associated with the best in the field and it was exciting to learn new approaches to filmmaking, as in the case of Alphonse Puthren and Soubin (Shahir).

How would you evaluate changes in the Malayalam cinema after your début?

Films have become more realistic. The taste of the audience has also changed. There was a phase when many in the audience used to hoot on seeing emotional scenes on the screen. Now they don’t do that. Also, the present-day audience is appreciative of lags in scenes if that helps the situation, whereas, till a few years ago, many directors considered it risky to have such sequences. I am also in awe of how certain directors choose and train their actors. All said and done, Trance is not a realistic film. It is a drama that will entertain the audience.

Short takes Anwar has directed Rajamanickyam, Annan Thambi, Chotta Mumbai and Ustad Hotel and the segments in the portmanteau films, Kerala Cafe and 5 Sundarikal — ‘Bridge’ and ‘Aami’ respectively. He was the co-producer of Bangalore Days and Parava and his individual productions are Premam and Valiyaperunnal.

Trance has Soubin Shahir, Vinayakan, Sreenath Bhasi, Dileesh Pothen, Chemban Vinod Jose and Jinu Joseph in the cast. Tamil director Gautham Menon plays villain.

Music is by Jackson Vijayan, composer Rex Vijayan’s brother. Sneha Khanwalkar, best known for her compositions in Gangs of Wasseypur, has sung the title track, ‘Raat’, a Hindi-Malayalam number. Actor Vinayakan has composed a track. Soubin, who acts as a mediaperson, has crooned a song, ‘Ennalum Mathayi

That’s what you did in your first three movies, all of them mass entertainers. But you surprised your audience with ‘Bridge’ in Kerala Cafe. So which is your kind of cinema?

I enjoy watching masala entertainers but hadn’t planned to make one. I had another project in mind for Mammookka [Mammootty]. But that didn’t work out. I was desperate to make a movie and Rajamanickyam came out of the blue. Annan Thambi and Chotta Mumbai too were of the same mould because I was expected to repeat the genre. When I made a hit with Mammootty, I had to make one with Mohanlal as well, although I wanted to do another subject with him. Comedy, suspense, sentiments and action — that was the general formula for a pot-boiler and I had to stick to that.

It took some time for me to get out of it and ‘Bridge’ came as a breather. The producer (Ranjith) told me that I could choose any subject and any actor, provided I work within the limited budget. I couldn’t have asked for more! However, I can’t pinpoint what my kind of cinema is. Because, things always pan out differently from what you have envisaged after sessions with the scenarist, cinematographer and musician.

Having worked with the two superstars of Malayalam, how do you perceive the new generation of actors?

Mammootty and Mohanlal will remain superstars, but the superstar era is over. That doesn’t mean the new actors are not talented enough. Each of them are superstars in their own way. The superstardom of the two Ms had much to do with the fact that the audience were in awe of them. People knew them only through their characters whereas now the audience knows every actor from close quarters, thanks to social media. They get to see how these actors are in real life, how they would react to a particular situation and treat them like a member of the family. So they no longer treat these actors act as superstars.

Malayalam cinema is going through a bright phase. But is there a change that you would like to see?

Several young, intelligent and talented youngsters have made a mark in direction and acting. I want that to happen in film production, distribution and theatre ownerships as well because, at present, there are a few individuals who control the reins and consider themselves to be carrying forward the legacy of Malayalam cinema.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/25klkl/article30642261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tvmtrance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-anwar-rasheed-on-trance-and-the-characters-played-by-fahadh-faasil-nazriya-and-gautham-menon/article30642262.ece
198,2020/01/24,There is a Malala in every household: Amjad Khan,"Inspired by the life of Pakistani Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, Gul Makai is set to release in India later this month. The film stars Reem Shaikh, Atul Kulkarni, Divya Dutta, Arif Zakaria, Mukesh Rishi, and Pankaj Tripathi in pivotal roles. The film is directed by Amjad Khan who is also the Goodwill Ambassador of IIMSAM, an intergovernmental institution mandated by the United Nations to fight malnutrition across the world.

Here, Khan talks about the creative vision behind Gul Makai, the research behind it, and the difficulties he faced while casting a Bangladeshi student for the role of Malala.

Director Amjad Khan

Excerpts:

What is the creative vision behind Gul Makai?

I got inspired by Malala’s courage right from the days she started blogging on the BBC website under the pseudonym Gul Makai against the oppression faced by her people in the Swat Valley. At the time, I had no idea that she would be hunted down and shot by the Taliban. When the dreadful incident took place in October 2012, I immediately decided that I must make a film about her courage and bravery. I had no idea that she will go on to win the Nobel Peace Prize. But it turned out to be a long struggle for me. The film finally got completed last year and with the help of the United Nations. I conducted a special screening in London in January last year which was attended by over 450 diplomats, politicians, and intellectuals from all across the globe. And the film received a standing ovation. I had screened it without any interval.

Tell us about the research that went into making the film?

I wanted to pay a visit to Malala while she was undergoing treatment but it couldn’t materialise due to security reasons. Now, I know a lot of journalists and authors in Pakistan who helped me with the research. Also, I talked to a lot of scholars, bureaucrats, poets, and artists to get a better perspective. But I felt something was missing. Also, I had a lot of questions that needed to be answered in order to connect the dots. That’s when I started reaching out to the local people living in the Swat Valley as well as Mingora. I also connected with people living in Balochistan, Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) of Pakistan. So, I had all the information with me. I handed it over to my writer Bhaswati Chakrabarty who ensured that we had a solid script to start with.

What exactly went wrong when you had initially cast a Bangladeshi girl in the role of Malala?

We auditioned hundreds of young actresses for the role of Malala. Finally, we found a girl who looked exactly like Malala. She was a 16-year old Bangladeshi student from Dhaka named Fatima Sheikh. While we tried our best to keep her identity secret, she told her friends in school about the same. And that’s how her identity got leaked. Her family started receiving threats from extremist groups. They even threw stones at her house in Dhaka. So, her family finally decided to back out due to the pressure. We started with the search again and finally, we decided to cast Indian television child actress Reem Shaikh for the role of Malala.

How do you see the relevance of your film in the present times?

I consider it a privilege as well as a huge responsibility to make a movie on the youngest Nobel Prize laureate. I strongly believe that such stories need to be told. There is a Malala in every household. Anyone can bring a change if you have the will to do it. And that's what our film Gul Makai is all about. I am extremely happy and very proud that the film is finally set to release in theatres.

Was visiting Jamia Millia Islamia and Jawaharlal Nehru University a part of your promotional strategy for “Gul Makai”?

I would like to say that we live in a democracy and it is the constitutional right of everyone to protest in a peaceful way.

199,2020/01/24,Why 'Delhi-6' resonates even more today than it did 10 years ago,"The A.R. Rahman-Prasoon Joshi composition, ‘Rehna Tu’, would perhaps be one of those rare songs in Hindi cinema that wallows in all-consuming love even while talking prosaically of accepting the lover with all their flaws. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra uses its overwhelming romance at an atypical juncture in Delhi-6 — in the background, to underline the long-standing friendship between Rajan and Ali Baig. This moment stood out for me when I saw the film again, almost a decade after its release in 2009.

The song can stand for both the union of lovers as well as the co-existence of two communities. A single line captures the acceptance of differences and the desired synchronicity and mutuality: ‘Haath thaam chalna ho to dono ke daayein haath sang kaise; Ek daayaan hoga, ek baayaan hoga; Thaam, haath ye thaam, chalna hai sang thaam le’ (How can we hold only our right hands when we walk hand in hand? One will be right, the other left. Take my hand, let us walk, hand in hand).

Not just this song, there’s more to go back to and admire in Delhi-6. In the midst of its stream of consciousness narrative, exotic vignettes of Old Delhi seen through NRI eyes and the seeming chaos, there is also a larger design that, in retrospect, eerily pre-empts the contemporary strife and atmosphere of fear, hate and anger in the country. Delhi-6 has aged well, and resonates way more today than perhaps it did back then.

Faultlines

Like the larger idea of a unifying, syncretic culture that Mehra establishes in the microcosm of the Old Delhi pin code 110006. “Kaun paraya hai? (Who is the other)” asks the old grandmother, Annapoorna Devi, rhetorically. Jai Gopal accepts prasad from Haji Suleman without batting an eyelid.

The social fabric is most evident in the soundtrack itself — from the aching sufi strains of ‘Arziyan’ shot against the majesty of Jama Masjid to the fervour of the bhajan ‘Tumhare Bhavan Mein’.

Yet this life, built on and around religion, also comes with its inherent faultlines. Amid all the bonhomie lurks the politics of religion that can make a simpleton, Mamdu, who believes in both Mecca Madina and Hanuman, go astray; that can incite Jai Gopal to destroy Mamdu’s mithai shop where he had spent almost half his life.

There is a kala bandar (black monkey) running amok in this world, balancing on the extremes of superstitions and stock market, caste divides and space programmes, arranged marriages and Indian Idol ambitions. It’s the key metaphor. Everybody might be looking for the destructive monkey out there but is it actually within us?

Soul mirror

There are other standout moments. “Moorkh ko moorkh banaane mein koi harz na hai (There’s nothing wrong in making a fool of fools),” says the sweeper Jalebi, anticipating the post-truth, WhatsApp-validated knowledge and wisdom of today.

Mainstream Hindi cinema has a way of simplifying and sentimentalising our essential complexities. However, that also makes it more accessible and effective in its messaging. There are easy resolutions here, be it fixing a broken radio, mending familial differences or making society suddenly see reason. Even while questioning the NRI nostalgia for home, it reasserts the longing for it; while showing the deep fissures, it holds the promise of repair.

As the recitation ‘Noor’, in the beginning, middle and end of Delhi-6 goes, all we need to do is peep into the mirror of our souls: ‘Zarre zarre mein usi ka noor hai; Jhaank khud mein wo na tujh se door hai; Ishq hai us se to sab se ishq kar; Is ibadat ka yahi dastooor hai” (His divine light shines in every speck; Look within, he is not far from you; If you love him, love everyone; This is the meaning of worship). Even today this almost naive sense of hope and healing feels worth holding onmto.

200,2020/01/24,"'Chhapaak' is earnest about its ‘social message’, but cinematically it does not rise above the propaganda","Walking into the theatre to watch Chhapaak, I was apprehensive about how graphic the film might get, whether it would be very emotionally draining. As it transpires, Chhapaak lets off audiences lightly. It handles something as grim as acid attacks with an easy touch that doesn’t force the horror upon viewers. The emphasis throughout is on hope, optimism, renewal, and not on the mind-numbing dreadfulness of a woman’s face ravaged for as petty a reason as romantic rejection. Yet, it is exactly this determined Pollyanna approach that left me a little disturbed as I walked out.

A few days later, a fresh Deepika Padukone controversy erupted over a TikTok video in which the actor asks make-up influencer Faby to recreate the look of Malti, Chhapaak’s protagonist. Faby does so, to the peppy background beat of pop song ‘Uff Teri Ada’, pouts at the camera, then covers her scarred face with mock coyness. In those fast-forwarded few minutes, the video reveals not just its own insensitivity, but also unwittingly locates and echoes the exact problem that plagues Chhapaak — its superficiality. Which is why, even as one appreciates the obvious earnestness with which director Meghna Gulzar has created this ‘social message’ film, Chhapaak remains just that, never managing to rise above the propaganda.

The counter to such a critique will invariably be that of accessibility; that Chhapaak needs to appeal to the masses. And one doesn’t dispute this. The film will indeed succeed in taking the issue of acid attacks to nooks and crannies and audiences in a way that no social worker or government programme can. Yet, cinematically, it is sad that Chhapaak throws the game away so readily.

Low intensity

Take a film like Dangal (2016), as mass as you can make them. The conflict there is far simpler — a young woman seeks to enter the male-dominated sport of wrestling — and yet the intensity is never underplayed. Whether the ferocity of training and taunts the Phogat sisters confront, or Geeta coming to terms with her femininity and sexuality on the one hand and her father’s ambitions and harsh regimen on the other, it stays gritty even as it stays firmly in the ‘pop’ zone.

This intensity is entirely missing in Chhapaak, unless you count Vikrant Massey’s simmering looks as social worker Amol. Yet, the central issue here is many times more harrowing — men destroying women in a very specific way. That the film starts with the Nirbhaya protests indicates that Gulzar recognises the close relationship between rape and acid attack — the assault on female physicality, female desirability, everything that constitutes the feminine — yet she doesn’t explore this in any sustained or rigorous way.

Instead, one gets vignettes: mandatory mirror scene, throwing away pretty dupatta scene, turned away from umpteenth job scene. Through all this, Malti is serene. You could argue that her eternal cheerfulness shows that the attacker couldn’t kill her spirit. As a message, that’s laudable. As a movie, one wants to see the journey she took to reach this state of nirvana. It isn’t enough to show a little boy screaming when he suddenly sees Malti; a braver film would have tackled how Malti dealt with the brutal blow of knowing that her face is now frightening.

The film is based on Laxmi Agarwal’s inspiring real life, but not all survivors get the kind of financial support Agarwal got from her father’s employer. There’s a telling scene where a survivor tells Malti that she too wants a face like hers. Malti’s response is breezy: “Oh you just need more surgeries.” But that needs money, says her friend. “Oh, there’s the ₹3 lakh compensation,” says Malti, jauntily, cluelessly.

The thoughtlessness of that scene is breathtaking. In real life, the ₹3 lakh compensation — that survivors often don’t ever get — will barely cover a single surgery, never mind the seven or ten surgeries needed for facial reconstruction. And what about food, medicines, rent?

Agarwal has spoken of how she is often asked to walk the ramp but is not paid for it — clearly, designers imagine that just ‘allowing’ an acid attack survivor on ramps is enough. Their gesture pretends to say there is beauty even in scars, but the fact that they don’t pay her a real model’s fees negates the gesture. These are harsh facts, which are entirely missing from the film.

So pretty

And what about the loss of self-confidence and self-worth? What does it take to emerge from that, to build a new identity? How many years of counselling, how much pain? The real Agarwal spent eight years indoors — just reading about it made me claustrophobic, how did Laxmi live it? Ordinary women struggle to handle rejection, so what gives Malti the ability to receive with unruffled placidity Amol’s rejection of her love? One doesn’t grudge Malti this equanimity; one wants to know how she came by it. The film’s obsession with harmony extends even to Malti’s lawyer — whose husband is so perfect as to be entirely unreal.

Frustration, anger, impatience, jealousy, fear — these are ugly emotions but real ones. Even more so when one has been brutally attacked and scarred. The film airbrushes it all away, just as the TikTok video reduces acid scars to clever make-up. If you dish out positivity with the relentlessness of a Jaggi Vasudev, your film could be as dangerously misleading as Photoshopped fashion models are for teenage girls. And that frightens me. Chhapaak deals with a very real, very horrifying crime that destroys the faces, minds and lives of young women, but it deals with it in a very pretty and sweet way so that nobody comes away feeling that they have had too close a brush with real life.

It seems to be saying: Look, we tackled a taboo subject. We even got a beautiful star to play the role of survivor. Don’t ask for more.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ik9wmm/article30643551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26SMchhapaak-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/chhapaak-is-earnest-about-its-social-message-but-cinematically-it-does-not-rise-above-the-propaganda/article30643553.ece
201,2020/01/24,‘Psycho’ movie review: A fascinating game of shadows,"(Spoilers ahead)

“If you want to study art, you first need to study the artist,” writes John Douglas, on analysing the behavioural patterns of psychopaths in his ground-breaking book, Mindhunter. If you flip through the pages of history, you will find one common thread about serial killers. That most gruesome forms of crime have always been perpetrated against women. More often than not, these serial killers are men who are loners, who are also broken “inside” and may appear ordinary “outside”. This duality with which psychopaths tend to function forms the conceit of Mysskin’s Psycho, delving deeper into the mind of a mentally-troubled man. To borrow Douglas’ quote, Psycho is a visual study of a psychopath.

Mysskin’s remarkable achievement — if you discount the artistic merits (more about this later) in Psycho — weighs heavily on making a serial killer the protagonist of the movie, giving him a voice and more importantly, a cause. The ‘guilt of an ordinary man’ is a recurrent theme that Mysskin often bases his subjects on: Nandhalala was about a son’s guilt; Anjathey was about a friend’s, Onayum Aatukuttiyum dealt with the guilt of a ‘lone wolf’, and Pissasu centred around the guilt of an accidental killer who becomes a victim in the end. Given his fetish for human psychology and for characters that are emotionally broken, Mysskin builds an intense narrative, exploring the ‘guilt’ of a morally-flawed hero: in this case, serial killer Anguli (a huge shoutout to Mysskin’s assistant for essaying this complex character. Sorry, I didn’t catch his name).

The movie has a slide in the beginning, paying homage to the Master, Alfred Hitchcock for Psycho (1960) which, coincidentally, turns 60 this year. Mysskin’s Psycho bears no similarity to the 1960 movie, apart from featuring a psychopath at the centre (who, oddly, looks like the terrifying Norman Bates) and the playful macabre tone. About the latter, Psycho’s opening sequence has graphic details (the movie is rated ‘A’). It beings with a woman howling for help, as Anguli is about to perform his ‘art’. To put it bluntly, the body is butchered and the torso is collected as a piece of trophy, in his slaughterhouse. There’s no information about the girl, nor about the man. Mysskin follows it up with a gloriously-shot scene of the girl’s parents at the crime scene. The mother comes to witness the headless body lying around in a two-piece. It’s her daughter, but she doesn’t react. A God’s Eye shot shows her walking away from the crime scene and collapsing: perhaps to establish how her world has just been destroyed.

Psycho Cast: Udhayanidhi Stalin, Aditi Rao Hydari, Nithya Menen and Ram

Director: Mysskin

Storyline: A visually-impaired artiste has to solve a jigsaw puzzle to get close to a serial killer who holds his girlfriend captive, in a slaughterhouse

There’s lot happening in Psycho — an Anjathey-styled police investigation led by Ram; a psychopath who treats women as his play dolls, and a love story between Gautham (an effective Udhayanidhi Stalin who looks sunken, ticking the boxes of a typical Mysskin protagonist) and Dhazhini (a superbly-cast Aditi Rao Hydari, whose serene face adds calmness to a rather dark world) — for Mysskin deals with three individual stories that lead up to the marvelously-staged last act, boasting of a Biblical tone and larger politics that send shudders.

Darkness creeps into its music, frames and characters. Take the scene where Dhazhini is taken to the slaughterhouse. Anguli preps for his ritual. Before he swings the knife, he’s perplexed at Dhazhini’s unimaginable resilience. She lets out a smile when he asks if she isn’t afraid. She replies with a simple, “Gautham will come for you.” Psycho, essentially, is about darkness. It’s about a visually-impaired music conductor (Gautham), who lives in the dark, and a man (Anguli) who casts darkness. It’s about how the two worlds meet and how the two characters break away from the confines of each world. Tanveer Mir’s shot compositions show how beautiful and cruel the world can be; I loved the tracking shot inside a railway station. I also loved the jump cuts (edited by Arunkumar) at two intervals, that show emptiness and chaos at the same time.

Beneath its serial killer premise, there’s a strong sense of Buddhist subtexts that run through the narrative. Like Hermann Hesse’s Siddhartha, is Psycho about the salvation of Gautham, who vanquishes darkness to restore light? Kamala, a disciple of Gauthama, guides Siddhartha to the path of self-discovery. Here too, there’s a Kamala Das (Nithya Menen) who aids Gautham in his quest to find answers to the Missing Case of Dhazhini.

One of the disturbing aspects of Psycho — at least for me — is the way Mysskin handles violence, which largely rests on the ‘shock’ factor more than giving chills. Let me make an admission here: I am a fan of extremist cinema and I say this with the least bit of sadistic pleasure. Of course, some of the visuals are disorienting in Psycho, but you don’t get the real human experience and know they are fabricated just to make the audience feel uncomfortable.

No form of literature or art can ever justify acts of violence or rape. Mysskin knows that. He doesn’t seek sympathy or empathy for serial killers, despite featuring a tad sympathetic character as the protagonist; it might get polarised responses even among the liberal voices. All he asks for, I believe, is to pay heed to their (silent?) cries. He hopes to find divinity in a psychopath, especially if you consider the climactic sequence — reminded me of The Seventh Seal — amplified by Ilaiyaraaja’s soulful Thai Madiyil song. What Anguli lacked was a lullaby and a comforting hug from a mother, or a sister, or a friend.

Early on, a psychiatrist makes a pertinent argument about the definition of ‘psychopath’. Anyone who commits crime against humanity in the form of ‘honour killing’ ‘mob lynching’ and so on are psychopaths, she argues. But what about people and circumstances that push emotionally-distraught people into becoming serial killers, if you look at it from a holistic view? Aren’t they equally accountable? Aren’t they all psychos?",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dmhrvf/article30643436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Udhay-Stalin-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/psycho-movie-review-a-fascinating-game-of-shadows/article30643438.ece
202,2020/01/24,‘Street Dancer 3D’ movie review: This dance saga is a compilation of indistinguishable performances,"It’s tough to appreciate the modern, urban phenomenon of street dance if you happen to be someone of a certain vintage who believes dance is all about fluidity, grace and facial expressions as much as physical moves. The slim story of Sahej (Varun Dhawan) and his group Street Dancers winning the Ground Zero championship then appears nothing more than a compilation of indistinguishable performances. The dance here looks like action set-pieces, bodily contortions and jumps and leaps in the air. Similar and repetitive at that, and stretching way too long over 150 minutes.

Street Dancer 3D Director: Remo D’Souza

Starring: Varun Dhawan, Shraddha Kapoor, Prabhu Deva

Run time: 150.10 minutes

Storyline: Sahej and his team, Street Dancers, have to win the Ground Zero championship

There is an emotional “injured brother” track and a romantic India-Pakistan romance brewing on the side. The dashing Indian will “rescue” the girl from her conservative Pakistani family, while her heart and conscience will bring out the hidden goodness in him. The director tries to pack in a dash of social relevance too by talking, in an utterly garbled way at that, about refugee culture and illegal immigration. There is some mumbo-jumbo involving physics, economics, history and moral science when arguing about why India and Pakistan should team up for the championship. And deep philosophical arguments on dancing to impress as against dancing to express, and dancing for the self as against dancing for the good of others.

The entire set of actors/dancers look as if they are trying very hard to play cool. The only moment that ignites the screen a wee bit is Prabhudeva reprising his Muqabala routine. Even then, it’s all about tapping into the collective nostalgia of the audience, nothing more.

As for the 3D, it’s yet again about human bodies, shafts of lights and sundry objects getting thrown at us. The only ones that interested me were some donuts.

203,2020/01/24,2020 films that should be on your watch-list,"It may be a trifle late for my most anticipated films for the year ahead, given that January is almost behind us, but here goes. Obviously, on top of the list has to be French auteur Leos Carax long-in-the-planning English-language début Annette, his first feature since 2012’s Holy Motors. Marion Cotillard plays a celebrated soprano married to edgy comic Adam Driver. They have a child, Annette, who has a special gift. Another keenly anticipated comeback, and another English-language début is Thai auteur Apichatpong Weerasethakul, who returns with Memoria, starring Tilda Swinton, that promises to be at least as enigmatic as his last feature, 2015’s Cemetery of Splendour. While on English-language débuts, France’s Ursula Meier makes hers with noir Quiet Land.

It is time for you to delve into your collections and watch Orson Welles’ Citizen Kane again. After giving us seven terrific episodes spread over two seasons of Mindhunter, David Fincher returns to the big screen with Mank where Gary Oldman plays screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz. The film follows the troubled development process of the Citizen Kane script. Fresh off Little Women and Marriage Story respectively, Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach are co-writing Barbie, a live-action interpretation of the iconic doll, with Margot Robbie, fresh off Bombshell herself playing her. I’m not sure if it’ll hit screens this year though.

If you were wondering what Ildiko Enyedi was up to after 2017’s brilliant On Body and Soul, you’ll be delighted to know that she’ll be back with her adaptation of Milan Fust’s 1942 novel The Story of My Wife, where a sea captain marries a woman on a dare. After 2016’s Sex Doll, Sylvie Verheyde is back this year with Madame Claude that will follow a prostitution business with a tremendous impact on French government and mafia in the 1960s.

Closer home, Singaporean filmmaker and visual artist John Clang is ready with A Love Unknown, an abstract tale of a woman in New York, and her abandoned daughter in Singapore who she has never met. The film premières at Rotterdam shortly. From Bangladesh, Live from Dhaka director Abdullah Mohammad Saad has completed principal photography on his next feature I See Waves, while eminence grise Mostofa Sarwar Farooki is halfway through the shoot of his most ambitious film yet, a complex journey tale, No Land’s Man, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Megan Mitchell. From Sri Lanka, Somaratne Dissanayake’s epic disaster drama Tsunami looks extremely promising as does Kalpana and Vindana Ariyawansa’s Little Miss Puppet AKA Rookada Panchi, where a little girl finds solace at a beachside carnival.

There are plenty of obvious ones that are not on this list, simply because they are on a myriad others, like the new Nolan, Bond, Reichardt, Jenkins, Villeneuve, Scott, Schrader, Soderbergh, Spielberg etc, that will get enough eyeballs closer to their release dates. So let me conclude with my most anticipated début.

204,2020/01/24,"‘Eternals’ is the most sci-fi of all Marvel films,’ says Kumail Nanjiani","Actor Kumail Nanjiani, who is part of the star-studded cast of Marvel Studio’s The Eternals, says the big budget superhero saga gave him the feeling of working on a “independent movie“.

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, The Big Sick star called the film an “epic” project that eclipses all of the other Marvel superhero films made till date.

“It’s really, really an epic. And it’s really such a science-fiction story. It’s a superhero story, but in some ways, it’s the most sci-fi of all the Marvel movies and it’s the most epic of all the Marvel movies.

“And the story spans thousands of years. So it’s really not like any of the other Marvel movies,” Nanjiani said.

The story of The Eternals is set millions of years ago when the cosmic beings known as the Celestials genetically experimented on humans to create super-powered individuals known as the Eternals along with the villainous Deviants.

The film, being directed by Chloe Zhao, will also feature Richard Madden, Salma Hayek, Angelina Jolie, Brian Tyree Henry, Gemma Chan and Kit Harington.

Nanjiani, 41, said despite being a superhero movie mounted on a huge scale, the film sometimes came across as a small budget film.

“Making this massive movie in many important ways still feels like you’re making an independent movie, in the sense that it really feels like a family and it feels like it’s really about characters and relationships and very small moments.

“So while you have certain scenes where you’re hanging up on a wire fighting bad guys and you have all these superpowers, the rest of it does feel like you’re making something really small,” the actor said.

205,2020/01/24,Brad Pitt reveals he was asked to play Neo in ‘The Matrix’,"Actor Keanu Reeves’ fan-favourite cybercriminal and computer programmer Neo was once supposed to be played by Brad Pitt. The 56-year-old actor, who is having a golden run this award season winning all the major best actor in a supporting role trophies for his performance in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, said he was approached for the first film in the franchise directed by Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski.

According to Collider, Pitt made the revelation during a stage interview with Leonard Maltin at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.

“I did pass on ‘The Matrix’ I took the red pill.That’s the only one I’m naming. I wasn’t offered two or three. Only the first one. Just to clarify that,” he said when Maltin quizzed him about films he had passed on.

The actor added that he never likes discussing the topic of his overlooked projects.

“I come from a place, maybe it’s my upbringing, if I didn’t get it, then it wasn’t mine. I really believe (the role) was never mine. It’s not mine. It was someone else’s and they go and make it.

“I really do believe in that. If we were doing a show on the great movies I’ve passed on, we would need two nights.”

206,2020/01/24,Director Nagathihalli Chandrashekar explains what is unique about Kannada film 'India vs England',"Nagathihalli Chandrashekar’s much-talked about film India vs England hits screens today. The film is not only shot in England but also extensively across India. It has some unusual pairings and cast. For instance, Vasishta Simha is playing the lead with a complete makeover of his image, Anant Nag plays a gemmologist, and Sumaltha Ambareesh, who plays a Kannada school teacher, is paired with Prakash Belawadi.

The film has music by Arjun Janya. The director, who is affectionately known as Meshtru, says making films with content is not easy but involves a lot of research and originality. Here he shares a few thought on what makes his film unique.

Edited excerpts:

Your film is releasing in Australia, England and the US...

Yes, I believe I started the era of international releases with my film America America. I am not boasting, but I still remember how I travelled with my film prints, meeting and exploring all the Kannada centres, sanghas and kootas. Finally, that paved way for that film to be released in 25 centres overseas!

Now your film is titled India VS England...

Yes. When I was in England for the screening of my last film Ishtakamya, the NRIs asked me why I made a film like America America and not on something about their lives. That was when I picked up my daughter’s book, Akshamsha Rekhamsha and renamed it India vs England. Akshamsha Rekhamsha translates to longitude and latitude.

How do people perceive Kannada films today? Is there a change over the last few years?

There definitely is a change. Especially after KGF Chapter 1. The change is seen not only overseas, but also within India. It has created a wave. That is why now films are being made on a grand scale, most of which are star-driven. Simultaneously, there are filmmakers who make content-driven films with subtitles. Both go hand-in-hand. India vs England belongs to the latter genre.

What would you say about certain people saying subtitles distract the viewer from the film as they are busy reading the text and miss out on the action?

It may be true. But let us take the international film festivals as an example. We get to see Japanese, Korean and French films. How can we understand them if there were no subtitles? Subtitles should be minimal and precise with the right font and should be placed in the right place. Since it is translated, some of the originality and nativity does get lost. But it is inevitable. For films submitted for the National Awards, subtitles is a must when the jury watches films in different languages. We ourselves have so many diverse languages. So I feel subtitles are a part of cinema and cannot be ignored.

How did you decide to cast Vasishta Simha in the lead? It is unusual to see him as the hero.

True. It is an unusual choice. I saw a vibrant actor in him. Sometimes even the artiste and the audience look for a change. I don’t know these labels — hero, villain — but a good performer should get new roles and when I saw him I thought he can be the surprise element of the film. Also, when you think of an NRI British-born Kannada boy, we always think of a fair-skinned, clean-shaven boy. I wanted to break that myth with this film. Vasishta has also worked hard on his look and diction to build his character by doing a lot of research on NRI Kannadigas. I believe an artiste should have that journey. His role is beyond a lover boy here. There are many tracks in the film such as crime, action, patriotism...

Tell us about Anant Nag’s role in this film...

Anant is always a favourite. He was the protagonist in my first film, Undo Hoda Kondu Hoda. We have journeyed together ever since. In India vs England, he plays a gemmologist. Normally, the term is misused in India. It is nothing like sitting on a chair in front of a camera and saying wear this stone or do certain things to get rid of problems. In fact, gemmology is an academic and scientific subject. Anant’s character shows you what an authentic gemmologist’s job is. We researched a lot on this subject too and gemmology in Kannada film is a new theme. The unknown areas of unknown professions should be shown on screen so people will get to known more. It should be done in an authentic way.

What would say is a special aspect of this film?

There are quite a few. We never went to foreign locations for just songs. In fact, for this film, we shot for 40 to 45 days in England in summer. Will Price, a British man, is the cinematographer for our film and we have covered the countryside of England which has never been explored before. This is also Sumalatha Ambareesh’s film before she went into politics and it is releasing when she has become one. There is a song with the Kannada varnamale (alphabet) to show you how easy it is to learn this language. I will say the film is the whole package and of course, the music by Arjun Janya.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/wma9p5/article30641999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24bgmnagathi3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-nagathihalli-chandrashekar-explains-what-is-unique-about-his-film-india-vs-england/article30642000.ece
207,2020/01/24,Manto would have been appalled that nothing has changed 70 years later: Nandita Das,"Nandita Das remembers wanting to do a book on her directorial debut, Firaaq. “It was a new experience for me to be directing a film [after] having acted in so many... There were so many stories that never got told, never got shared. I wish I had done that book,” she says as we settle down to talk about the volume she has just brought out. The lovingly put together and lavishly-produced Manto and I lies on a table in front of us in her living room with a view of the sprawling sea stretching ahead.

It was when the film was coming to an end, and especially after the disappointment with the way it was released theatrically, that she got the idea for the book. At the same time, with the digital medium coming in, many people were watching it online. “Every single day I would get emails, someone would message me. There were these mixed feelings about the whole journey.”

‘Journey’ has been the leitmotif of Das’s life. She feels the sense of exploration and adventure have been instrumental in freeing her from the fear of failure. “You are not outcome-oriented. You are not stressed about what will happen. It allows you to try out and experiment with different things. When I wrote my first play, acted in my first film or directed my first film... it wasn’t to prove [my] skills or to excel or reach out. It was just for the joy of doing and the desire of wanting to tell that story,” she says. The book was also born of the same compulsion, to say something without worrying about how it would turn out.

She gave almost six years of her life and a lot of herself to the journey with Manto — the film as well as the writer and man she has always admired. This unique voyage finds its way into the book. “In that sense the book was cathartic because I could relive the whole film all over again. Stories that I had forgotten came back.”

She also refers to the book as being “privy to the intimate process” of making the film, describing its structure as “very stream of consciousness” — going from where she began, to why she did the film, to how she slowly put things together.

“I have been as candid as I could in sharing the excitement, the challenges, and the trials and tribulations of making the film,” she says in the introduction.

Trials such as researching someone who had died in 1955; of Manto’s contemporaries, only his sister and one writer in Pakistan, Intezaar Hussain — who Das met briefly— remained.

Collection of stories

Similarly, from the challenges of casting and getting so many strong actors to do small cameos, to art direction, “every phase had a story that I felt I could share.” Then there was getting to know Bombay, the city Manto loved and where she herself was born but never really lived. “I came back and saw the Bombay that I could otherwise never have seen, through all my location scouting.”

The book’s title is Manto and I; it’s not just about the creative journey but Das’s own emotional, political, personal and spiritual experiences as well — experiences such as shooting with a small child in 45-degree heat, with Gurdas Mann and 250 villagers doubling up as junior artists. It also made her question why there were fewer women in the field, and she came to understand and accept the tag of ‘woman director’ that she had always been uncomfortable with.

What does the act of writing itself entail for her? “It’s about bringing thoughts, feelings and experiences together that you may not have articulated to yourself.” She enjoys the solitary nature of the process, in contrast with filmmaking, which involves having to deal with so many people. Nevertheless, “I also have a collaborative spirit. I thrive on both. They have their own separate joys and challenges.”

Das started writing in November 2018, two months after Manto’s release, and finished the book in October last year. This was a lean phase when she was involved mostly in social advocacy work, spending time with her son and making a guest appearance in Venu Udugala’s Telugu film Virata Parvam.

Kindred spirit

A lot of the book was written on flights, in the quiet time she seized without people and gadgets around. And much of the rest was fleshed out at home, in the midst of domestic chaos, much as Manto himself often wrote.

She may have grown up on Gandhi and Tagore, but she began seeing a kindred spirit in Manto when she started reading his work in college, and later his essays that revealed the man behind the words. She thinks that what Manto stood for is deeply relevant to the world today, be it to do with freedom of expression or the identity issues, divisiveness and strife that we are witnessing. “He would have been harsh and blunt and appalled that nothing has changed 70 years later,” she says. But, perhaps, also happy to see the young in his beloved Bombay rising up and resisting.

For Das, Manto is an idea, Mantoiyat, that represents the free-spiritedness, conviction, truth and courage we need today, especially to counter skewed narratives and lies. “I seek refuge in Manto to respond to today.” For now, in the midst of all the anger, fear- and hate-mongering, she wants to engage with the fence-sitters rather than the converted: “My language is now less about what I feel than about how I can share in a way that others can hear. I want to speak in such a way that they will listen rather than pull the shutters down.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1j3i1p/article30641918.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26SMNanditaDasArtjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/manto-would-have-been-appalled-that-nothing-has-changed-70-years-later-nandita-das/article30641919.ece

It all begins from a film shooting set. Producer Prathapa Varma (Kalabhavan Shajon), who borrowed a large amount from Boss (Mammootty), a money lender, has failed to return it on time and is avoiding the lender and not picking his calls.

The director, of the movie within the movie, has set up the scene to shoot the hero’s introduction. Mid-way through the shot, the hero of our movie, the Shylockian lender, arrives in style in his Rolls Royce to confront the producer. With the producer failing to return the money, Boss and his men kidnap the director.

Much of Shylock makes one wonder whether a scene similar to this happened in the film's set too, for it is a superstar mass movie that can be made on autopilot without a director's interventions. Half of the superstar's lines too are borrowed from other movies, both Malayalam and Tamil, in the name of ""paying tribute"". This is then explained away as his habit, due to his childhood dream of becoming a film star. Or maybe, the dialogue writers were kidnapped too.

Listening to the background score of familiar beats and tunes, one cannot be blamed for wondering whether the music director was kidnapped too. For instance, the hero's theme song has lines praising even his Rolls Royce.

Director Ajai Vasudev, who has worked only with Mammootty in his film career (his previous works include Rajadhiraja and Masterpiece) does not even attempt to bring anything new to the table. Milking the star's style and mass fan base is the only agenda. The first half is sprinkled with quite a few scenes that could send die-hard fans into a tizzy. Mammootty's Boss is a playful, villanious hero, a cross between some of his famous past roles. Almost all the other characters pale into irrelevance, as nothing here happens without Boss. Even the sidekicks are only there to crack jokes and provide introductory speeches before Boss’ arrival.

The slight fun element of the first half is lost post-interval as the movie shifts to a lengthy flashback, which gets over only when the movie is about to end. This flashback, set in Tamil Nadu, has a done-to-death story, which would serve as the base for revenge.

The star worship reaches its peak during an outdated ""item song"" filmed inside a dance bar. As soon as Boss arrives in style, and sits imperiously on a sofa, the three dancers surround him, singing in his praise, calling him a ""megastar"". The word ""megastar"" lights upon the screen, on cue. Not satisfied yet, the director plays out a clip from Padayappa, of Ramya Krishnan's character praising Rajini's evergreen style, meant to imply our star here.

If only they had worked half as hard on the script as they did on the star worship, this movie would have made a better tribute to their favourite star.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3o900f/article30641611.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/shylock,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/shylock-movie-review-when-megastar-mammootty-towers-over-the-script/article30641612.ece
209,2020/01/24,"‘Panga’ movie review: Kangana Ranaut's latest is all heart and charm, with an emotional wallop at the end","There is a phrase that had once been used to describe Frank Capra classics: “fantasies of goodwill”. Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari’s Panga may well be one of the closest and most charming Bollywood equivalents in recent times.

There is a hell of a great deal of positivity, kindness and benevolence flowing in the veins of the denizens of ordinary, middle-class Bhopal. Be it Jaya Nigam (Kangana Ranaut), the former kabaddi champion, now a railway clerk and mother of a 7-year-old, who decides to make a comeback in the game, or her ever-smiling, bright-eyed husband (Jassi Gill) and the delectably precocious son Adi (Yagya Bhasin); everyone is utterly butterly nice. It is heartening to see men becoming the wind beneath the woman’s wings, but it’s not just them alone. Far from being a wet blanket, all of the people in Jaya’s life — from the office colleagues to the neighbour bhabhi, the stern coach or the competitive team captain — are ultimately encouraging when it comes to helping her take the decision forward in the right direction. Only blip, if at all, is the nasty but inconsequential boss.

No wonder the issues here appear to get negotiated with a relative sense of ease and might seem devoid of any major complexities. But not once does the film feel unreal, pretentious or righteous, and thankfully doesn’t wallow in its nobility. The essential feel-goodness doesn’t come across as specious or contrived.

Like Mary Kom, Panga is about how love, marriage and children need not come in the way of any sportswoman’s success, but what sets it refreshingly apart is a wonderful sense of humour. The problem might be serious, but the telling is light-hearted. The over-arching goodness is balanced out perfectly with a jovial impertinence. There is a loveable cheekiness to characters, from the mother (Neena Gupta) to even the family doctor and especially when it comes to the son Adi and bestie Meenu (Richa Chadha). The persistent, playful sparring in almost all the relationships is disarming. The credit should go to the writing (Nikhil Mehrotra and Ashwini Iyer Tiwari), especially the dialogues, which is delightfully pert and saucy, spilling over with little, chuckle-along moments.

Panga Director: Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari

Starring: Kangana Ranaut, Jassi Gill, Yagya Bhasin, Richa Chadha, Neena Gupta, Smita Dwivedi, Megha Burman, Rajesh Tailang, Sudhanva Deshpande, Kusum Shastri

Storyline: A former kabaddi champion, now a railway clerk and mother of a 7-year-old, decides to make a comeback in the game

Run time: 131 minutes

There is the charm of the quotidian, the simple pleasures of the family’s scooter ride and chaat outing. However, the measured script handles the big scenes just as well. There is an authenticity, not just in the evocation of the small-town rhythms but also the world of railways and the slice of sports; from the technicalities of kabaddi to the typical tropes of a sports film, right down to the build-up, snatching victory from the near-defeat and the triumph of the underdog. Yet there is a freshness, anticipation, investment and an overwhelming lump-in-the-throat, emotional wallop in the lead up to the expected finale on the mat.

Nowhere can the disjunction between the reel and the real be more evident than in the persona of Kangana Ranaut. Her highly questionable stand on issues (especially of late) aside, she continues to play an interesting array of women on screen. A bunch of the recent ones may not have made the desired impact, but Jaya reaches out in a wholesome, winsome way. Ranaut brings in the right amount of vulnerability, lack of sureness, yet a determination and cussedness to the character, be it crying while making rotis or demanding that she be understood in the same way as she is held responsible for understanding the men in her life. Without quite making a show of it, Ranaut even works on a distinct body language for each of the phases, transforming without making it obvious: from the sprightly young champion to the weary mother to the fitness-seeking comeback player.

A consistent pattern in Ranaut’s recent work has been the overt lack of big male stars. But Jassie Gill is not denied his share of the spotlight. In fact every character and actor, right down to the smallest of supporting ones — Kusum Shastri as the neighbour, for instance — make an impression. The sparklers of the show, however, are “bhagwan ka roop” child Yagya Bhasin and Richa Chadha specially when she is drawing parallels between raiding in kabaddi and setting up “rishta” with a potential groom.

‘Panga’ is a Hindi word which may roughly translate to “meddling with” or “messing up” but the English phrases somehow are not quite able to capture and communicate the multifarious nuances the word acquires when applied to different contexts. All one can say is that the characters in the film, the writing and filmmaking itself are all about taking panga with the defined and the established norms. The kind of panga that deserves more power.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/z3fxiu/article30641510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/panga,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/panga-movie-review-kangana-ranauts-latest-is-all-heart-and-charm-with-an-emotional-wallop-at-the-end/article30641511.ece
210,2020/01/24,"How to crack TNPSC Group-IV Services examination: use disappearing ink, re-marked answer sheets","The Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) on January 24 debarred 99 candidates for life on charges of indulging in malpractice in the Group-IV Services examination conducted on September 1, 2019.

Three persons have been arrested so far in the case.

Crime Branch CID officers, probing the case, said the 99 candidates used evaporating ink to mark the answers to objective type questions.

After the markings vanished a couple of hours later, two officials of the State government, entrusted with transporting the answer scripts to safe custody, inked in the right answers on the scripts.

39 in top 100

While 39 such candidates passed the exam and made it to the top 100 in the rank list, others could not clear the examination since the suspect officials did not have time to make entries in all the 99 answer scripts of candidates who appeared in the Rameswaram and Keelakarai centres of Ramanathapuram district, investigating officials said. “Further investigation also revealed that the suspected agents along with those in examination duty in these centres, had replaced answer sheets of 52 candidates,” the TNPSC said earlier in the day.

The TNPSC had conducted the Group-IV exams for filling up 9,398 posts for which 16,29,865 candidates appeared. The results were declared on November 12, 2019, and the certificate verification of the successful candidates was under way when the fraud came to light.

An First Investigation Report (FIR) has been registered against the 99 candidates and suspected agents, the Commission said.

Hours after registering a case, a special team under the direct supervision of Director-General of Police M.S Jaffar Sait cracked the case and unravelled the modus operandi of the suspects. The two suspect tahsildars were taken into custody in Ramanathapuram and brought to Chennai for interrogation. Special teams are on the lookout for one Jayakumar of Anna Nagar, Chennai, who is alleged to be the kingpin, and his associates.

TNPSC secretary K. Nanthakumar (left) leaves the district treasury in Ramanathapuram on January 10, 2020.

Given two pens

According to officials, a source in the Directorate of Public Instruction campus passed on the details of applicants to the two tahsildars, who then contacted them with offers to help during the exam. After asking them to opt for Rameswaram or Keelakarai as the examination centre, the suspect officials collected ₹10-12 lakh from each of them as “service” charge.

The candidates were then given two pens on the day of the examination — one was a regular pen for writing the registration number and other identification details, the other was filled with evaporative ink to mark the answers.

“After the ink vanished an hour later, the suspect officials who had the list of their candidates then made fresh markings with the help of readily available answer keys. This is the first time that we have come across such a fraud,” a senior investigator told The Hindu.

However, the official said though the fraud came to light now, there was credible input that the suspects deployed the same modus operandi in an earlier examination conducted by the TNPSC. “We have strong reasons to believe that some other candidates who benefited from the earlier fraud are in government service now. We have secured one such candidate, ” he said.

Answers outsourced

On how the suspect tahsildars knew the answers, the official said they leaked a copy of the question paper to a third party soon after the commencement of the examination. The answers were kept ready by the time the duo reached a pre-determined place.

Asked why the candidates had to use an evaporative ink while they could have left the answer scripts blank, the official said the TNPSC had introduced a procedure where invigilators had to check and sign every script, certifying the number of questions answered.

Since only 39 candidates could make it through the fraudulent manner, the suspects were in the process of refunding the money taken from other candidates. “Since they didn’t have much time, they left many answer scripts of candidates who used the evaporative ink untouched and they are lying blank in the custody of the TNPSC now. The seal applied on the answer script bundles at the examination centres have also been tampered with,” the official speaking on conditions of anonymity said.

On how the scam surfaced, another CB-CID official said under a new provision introduced by the TNPSC to bring about transparency, candidates could access the answer scripts of others. It was during this cross checking that some candidates found that most of the toppers belonged to Rameswaram and Keelakarai centres and flagged the issue.

The CB-CID on January 24 night arrested three persons R. Nitish Kumar, 21, who cleared the 2019 Group-IV exam; M. Thirumurgan, 35, who passed allegedly by using the same fraudulent means in 2017, and is working as an assistant in the Energy Department; and E. Ramesh, 39, Office Assistant in the DPI campus.

The suspect tahsildars are being questioned on their involvement malpractice in other competitive examinations, sources in the agency added.

211,2020/01/24,Madras HC declares South Indian Artistes Association’s elections as null and void,"The Madras High Court on Friday declared as null and void the elections held to the South Indian Artistes Association, apex body of actors, in June last year and ordered fresh polls.

Justice K Kalyana Sundaram, who passed the order on various petitions filed on the matter, directed that elections to the posts of office-bearers of the association be conducted afresh within three months and appointed Justice B. Gokuldas as the election officer.

“In the ultimate analysis, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the decisions taken by the Executive Committee of the petitioner association in the meetings held after the expiry of their tenure i.e., on 18.10.2018 and the actions taken pursuant to the same are invalid in law and not binding on the members of the Association,” he said in the order.

He also said the Special Officer appointed by the government shall continue to discharge her duties till declaration of the results and the new office bearers assume office.

The court had earlier stayed counting of votes in view of alleged irregularities in postal ballots and that the announcement for the elections was issued after the tenure of the office-bearers ended.

The Tamil Nadu government had informed the court that the elections were invalid as they were not conducted in accordance with the by-laws of the association.

The series of litigations started after the Registrar of Societies passed an order deferring the election to the association indefinitely in view of the allegations that name of 61 members were allegedly removed from the rolls just days before the election.

Challenging the order, actor Vishal, the general secretary of the association, moved the high court. After several rounds of hearings, the high court finally permitted the conduct of election on June 23 last year.

There were allegations that the State government was interfering in the affairs of the association by appointing a special officer to manage the affairs of the body.

The State government through its counsel submitted that the Registrar of Societies had every right to inquire into the complaints filed by members of the association and if needed to appoint special officers to monitor the affairs of the association.

The State further stated that as per by-laws of the association, there is no provision to extend the tenure of the existing office bearers and hence the election conducted by office bearers whose term were expired are invalid.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/o6yevt/article30644964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/madras-hc-declares-south-indian-artistes-associations-nadigar-sangam-elections-as-null-and-void/article30644966.ece

213,2020/01/24,"Key witness in Kodanad break-in and murder case missing, police form teams to trace him","A security guard and a prime witness in the sensational Kodanad dacoity-cum-murder case, who himself was injured during the break-in into the bungalow of the former chief minister Jayalalithaa in April 2017, has gone missing. Special police teams have been formed to trace his whereabouts.

Officials said that Krishna Thaba was working as a security guard at the Kodanad Estate when he and another security guard, Om Bahadur, were attacked by a group of 11 men who were trying to enter the bungalow of the former Chief Minister allegedly to steal money and valuables from the property.

The attack resulted in the death of Om Bahadur, while Thaba, who was also posted as security at the same gate as the one through which the gang managed to gain entry into the estate, was seriously injured. He was admitted to hospital and managed to recover from his injuries, rejoining work a few weeks after the attack. The attackers were subsequently arrested by the Nilgiris district police and charged with the murder and dacoity, among other charges.

After the incident occurred however, it has been said that Thaba quit his job as security guard at the estate and returned to his native village in Nepal, from where too, he seems to have left to find a job. As Thaba is the Prosecution Witness Number 1 in the case, the police have formed special teams to try and locate him, so that he can testify before the court in the upcoming hearings, when questioning of witnesses in the case is to begin.

Officials said that Thaba had returned to his village and had been living there for a short while, before leaving to find work, possibly in Assam or West Bengal. As Thaba does not use a mobile phone or any electronic communication device, police are finding it difficult to trace his whereabouts.

The search for Thaba has been ongoing for over two weeks, with police confident of locating him in the coming days.

This is the first time in TWAD’s history that such a large quantity has been supplied.

According to a press release, there has been a steady rise in the drinking water supply since May 2017. TWAD supplied 1,816 mld in May last year and it was further increased to 2,000 mld in December 2019. As the major dams across the State have a storage of 158 thousand million cubic feet of water (TMC) against their capacity of 200 TMC, TWAD is confident to maintain the supply for another five months.

Moreover, the average groundwater table has also increased by three metres in January this year. The water table has risen from 17.5 metres to 14.5 metres observed in May last year. TWAD observed the water level through 1,286 wells.

In the release, TWAD’s managing director C.N. Mahesvaran said the Board identified reasons for deficiency in its distribution system through a SWOT (strength, weakness, opportunity and threat) analysis. Some of them were power supply interruptions, leak and bursts in pipeline, over-drawal and illegal extractions in certain areas.

The Board initiated water tanker supply to un-served areas in places such as Ramanathapuram and took up work to revamp pipeline infrastructure, augment sources and improve supply.

215,2020/01/24,"No privatisation of government district hospitals, says Tamil Nadu Health Minister","Tamil Nadu’s rural healthcare system is good and there is no chance of privatising government district hospitals in the State, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said on Friday.

Replying to a question on NITI Aayog’s decision to link private medical colleges with functional government district hospitals through Public Private Partnership model, he said the State government was yet to look into it. “But there is no chance of privatisation in our State,” he told reporters during the sidelines of an event to launch the Apollo Institute of Spine Surgery and spine surgery robot.

A “challenge” has emerged in Tamil Nadu’s plan to add four more new government medical colleges in Ariyalur, Cuddalore, Kallakurichi and Kancheepuram. While the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s Technical Evaluation Committee has given the nod for the four colleges, the State is waiting for the final decision of the Empowered Committee, the Minister said.

The State, last year, got the nod for establishing nine new medical colleges with 60% funding from the Centre and 40% funding from the State. Though the Minister did not divulge details on what the challenge was, he listed out criterion that should be fulfilled in order to get the final nod.

The Minister said that the tendering process for the nine new medical colleges was completed, and the Chief Minister would lay the foundation stones soon.

216,2020/01/24,DMK alliance to undertake signature campaign against CAA-NPR-NRC,"The DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance (SPA) in the State will undertake a massive signature campaign across Tamil Nadu against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizenship (NRC).

“We will meet the people of Tamil Nadu and undertake a massive signature campaign from February 2 to 8. Once we complete the campaign, we will meet the President of India and hand the signatures over to him,” DMK president M.K. Stalin told reporters after a meeting of the alliance party leaders at Anna Arivalayam that lasted over two hours.

The meeting passed resolutions demanding that the CAA and NRC not be implemented and that the Tamil Nadu government announce that it would not implement the NPR in the State.

When asked about Home Minister Amit Shah’s statement that the CAA will be implemented despite protests across States, Mr. Stalin said, “Amit Shah is saying that. We are opposing it. We will continue to oppose it and are taking efforts to ensure there will be a proper resolution to it.”

The SPA held that the BJP, in order to fulfil its election manifesto, was dangerously turning the entire country into a protest zone. “The NPR manual that has been published, gives rise to fears that the NPR exercise is entirely the base step for the NRC,” the resolution said.

The resolution also blamed the AIADMK and the PMK for the CAA crisis in the country. “If the BJP has created a situation where every citizen has to stand in a queue to prove his or her citizenship, the first and foremost reason is that the AIADMK and the PMK voted in favour of the bill in the Rajya Sabha,” it said.

The parties also demanded that the AIADMK immediately convene a Cabinet meeting and pass a resolution that NPR would not be implemented in Tamil Nadu.

217,2020/01/24,"Will consider listing of plea for disqualification of 11 AIADMK MLAs, SC tells DMK","Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Friday agreed to consider listing a petition filed by the DMK for the disqualification of 11 AIADMK MLAs for voting against Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisamy in a confidence motion in 2017.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, during an oral mentioning, referred to a January 21 judgment by a Supreme Court Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman requiring Speakers of Lok Sabha and State Assemblies to decide disqualification petitions against legislators, especially those who defect, within a “reasonable period” of maximum three months.

This judgment had also urged Parliament to amend the Constitution to strip Speakers, who may be biased by their respective political ideology, of their power to decide disqualification pleas under the Tenth Schedule and hand it over to an independent tribunal to decide fairly and impartially.

This judgment works quite opposite to what the Supreme Court had orally observed in July last year while hearing the DMK’s case for disqualification of the 11 AIADMK MLAs.

Justice Bobde (as he was then) had expressed strong reservations about appropriating powers conferred exclusively on the Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker under the anti-defection law to conduct disqualification proceedings against State’s Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and 10 other AIADMK MLAs for voting against the CM in February 2017.

“When the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) of the Constitution confers the power of disqualification on the Speaker, why should the court assume this power? Why should the court assume the power of the Speaker for something which happens inside the House?” Justice S.A. Bobde had asked Mr. Sibal then

Mr. Sibal is appearing for DMK leader R. Sakkarapani, who has appealed an April 2018 order of the Madras High Court.

In its 57-page order, the High Court had held that it could not, merely on the basis of a writ petition under Article 226, encroach on the Speaker’s powers under the Tenth Schedule.

The High Court had reasoned in its order that it was “difficult to conceive how this court can disqualify the concerned MLAs... Passing of such orders would only not amount to judicial overreach, it would also amount to gross breach of judicial discipline, if not contempt”.

The High Court had further refrained from passing any orders on the prayer made by Mr. Sakkarapani to issue a mandamus to the Speaker to disqualify the 11 AIADMK legislators under the anti-defection law.

The High Court had said the legal question of whether a court could direct a Speaker to disqualify members was pending consideration before the apex court.

Arguing before the Justice Bobde Bench, Mr. Sibal submitted in July 2019 that if the Speaker had abandoned his duty under the Tenth Schedule, the court should now take over.

“If the Speaker, who has the power, does not decide on the disqualification, the court will have to,” Mr. Sibal had argued.

Mr. Sakkarapani’s petition said 11 MLAs from the Panneerselvam faction voted against the trust vote on February 18, 2017. The plea for their disqualification was made before the Speaker under Paragraph 2 (1)(b) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. However, the Speaker did not issue any notice on the disqualification petition.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/co0nkt/article30636231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24TH-SUPREME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/will-consider-listing-of-plea-for-disqualification-of-11-aiadmk-mlas-sc-tells-dmk/article30641087.ece

The Commission has further debarred these 99 candidates from appearing in its examinations for life.

During a preliminary investigation into the issue, the TNPSC found that these candidates in consultation with their agents, chose the exam centres in Keelakkarai and Rameswaram and were supplied with answers by their agents, an official release stated.

A First Investigation Report (FIR) has been registered against these 99 disqualified candidates and suspected agents for initiating criminal proceedings.

“Further investigation also revealed that the suspected agents along with those in examination duty in these centres, had replaced answer sheets of 52 candidates. Of these, 39 have ranked among the top 100 candidates,” it pointed out.

Since 39 of these candidates ranking in the top 100 candidates have been disqualified, they have been replaced by another qualified 39 candidates and the certificate verification process is on for them.

TNPSC held the Group-IV exams for filling up a total of 9,398 posts on September 1 last year, in which 16,29,865 candidates appeared. The results were declared on November 12 last year and the certificate verification process is on. Posts on social media had claimed there were malpractices at the Rameswaram and Keelakkarai exam centres in Ramanathapuram and that most of the candidates, who appeared in these centres stood in the top 100 ranks.

219,2020/01/24,Vaiko takes a dig at Rajinikanth,"Taking a dig at actor Rajinikanth for his statement that incidents related to the 1971 Superstition Eradication Conference undertaken by ‘Periyar’ E. V. Ramasamy must be “forgotten”, MDMK founder Vaiko on Thursday questioned if that was so why the actor had raised the issue on his own at Thuglak’s 50th anniversary celebrations.

In a statement, Mr. Vaiko referred to Mr. Rajinikanth’s statement that certain incidents in the past about Periyar cannot be denied but should be forgotten and asked: “Naturally, the question arises as to why he is raking the issue up now.”

The Rajya Sabha member also sought to know as to why Mr. Rajinikanth is refusing to clarify that his intentions were not to bring disrepute to Periyar.

“It is natural for the people of Tamil Nadu to think as to who is behind him (Rajinikanth),” Mr. Vaiko contended.

Mr. Vaiko also went on to laud Periyar for his progressive thinking during his lifetime. “Periyar is not a single man but a movement by himself. A movement that came about to reform the society.” It was Periyar, who brought about the amendment in the Constitution for social justice, Mr. Vaiko said. “It was Periyar who fought against subjugation of women,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/vaiko-takes-a-dig-at-rajinikanth/article30637998.ece
220,2020/01/24,"‘BJP, Sangh Parivar attempt to distort facts spreading to T.N.’","In an apparent jibe at actor Rajinikanth for his comments on social reformer ‘Periyar’ E.V. Ramasamy, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary in-charge of Tamil Nadu Sirivella Prasad alleged that the attempts to distort facts and history were spreading in the State too.

“The BJP and Sangh Parivar have been distorting facts and history of the nation. Tamil Nadu is not an exemption to it. Recently one person remarked about Periyar. There were attempts to saffronise Tamil saint-poet Thiruvalluvar,” he said at an event organised at Sathyamurthy Bhavan, the party’s headquarters to mark the birthday anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

Mr. Prasad did not directly name the actor. He was speaking in the context of how Netaji despite having difference of ideology, respected facts and history. But in the present scenario, things are different, he added.

“The BJP and Sangh Parivar attempts to distort facts are also spreading to Tamil Nadu and we must be careful,” he said.

Mr. Prasad also recalled how Netaji resigned from civil service after hearing about India's struggle for freedom and equated it to how IAS officers have resigned now refusing to work under the Modi government.

Speaking at the event, former TNCC president K.V. Thangkabalu expressed hope that the Congress will come back strongly and regain its lost ground.

221,2020/01/24,Book on Kiran Bedi launched,"“She is a role model that everyone should emulate,” Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit said of Kiran Bedi, the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry.

Mr. Purohit, who launched the book Where Kindness Spoke, published by Sterling Publishers, on Thursday, which is devoted Ms. Bedi’s work in the Union Territory, said he had been her fan since 1982, when as a deputy commissioner of police she had famously ordered the removal of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s car.

‘Fighting spirit’

He also appreciated Ms. Bedi “for coducting the 10 a.m. meetings. You are the only one. No governor does that. She has tremendous strength and fighting spirit,” he said.

He praised Shivani Arora, the author of the book for her proficiency in Hindi and English that enabled her to translate the tweets and blogs of Ms. Bedi.

Ms. Bedi, who received the first copy, said she had surprised herself by continuing in the current position for over 3.5 years. She attributed it to the challenges she and the Chief Minister dealt with every day. “The secret is probably the way we are dealing with each other. He challenges me I challenge him. Every day new small battles have been won,” she said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/eyfgnp/article30639893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23Janchsuj02-BoG86714O9A3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/book-on-kiran-bedi-launched/article30637893.ece
222,2020/01/24,Tamil Nadu rolls out ration card portability,"Ahead of the ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ scheme expected to be rolled out by the BJP government at the Centre in June, the Tamil Nadu government has accorded administrative approval for the implementation of intra-State portability of ration cards.

The scheme enables ration cardholders to purchase foodgrain from any fair price shop in the State. The intra-State portability would be introduced in Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli districts on a pilot basis and then be rolled out across the State, a G.O. issued by the Cooperation, Food and Consumer Protection Department said.

Presently, there are 35,233 fair price shops run by various agencies such as cooperatives, the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation and women’s self-help groups, among others. A total of 9,635 of them are part-time shops. In all, 2,05,03,379 families have been provided with smart ration cards.

For effective portability of ration cards, the State government has instructed authorities to make a 5% additional allotment of essential commodities than the usual.

“For availing the facility, there should be a minimum distance between the existing shop and the commodity lifting shop. Hence, the existing shop to which the family card is attached and the shop from which the commodity is lifted should not be in the same revenue village in rural areas and not in the same ward in urban areas,” the order specified.

According to the Commissioner of Civil Supplies, the portability will be helpful to migrant labourers. Those who may not be in a position to get their commodities from the shops their cards are attached to will also stand to benefit.

“Cardholders can get their entitled commodities from other shops based on their convenience and availability of commodities,” the order stated.

“They may draw their entitled commodities either through smart card, Aadhaar card or by using registered mobile number by getting OTP,” it added.

Tamil Nadu has already put in place end-to-end computerisation of the public distribution system. In the Governor’s address to the Assembly earlier this month, the AIADMK government indicated its willingness to implement the ‘One Nation, One Ration Card’ scheme.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rjvogg/article30637835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THSMARTCARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-rolls-out-ration-card-portability/article30637836.ece
223,2020/01/24,"After Puducherry CM, now Minister files case against Bedi","A week after Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy moved the Madras High Court against Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Kiran Bedi’s insistence on disbursing cash instead of the free distribution of rice to ration card holders, Local Administration Minister A. Namassivayam filed another writ petition against her on the row over appointment of State Election Commissioner (SEC) in the Union Territory.

The Minister’s petition has been listed before a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha on Friday, for deciding its maintainability. Filing an affidavit in support of his plea, the Minister said the Union Territory had five municipalities and 10 commune panchayats, comprising 98 village panchayats in three blocks. Yet,office of the SEC remained vacant since May 31, 2015.

Since the Government of Puducherry had a constitutional mandate to conduct local body elections in a time bound manner, the council of ministers on May 25, 2019, decided to appoint retired IAS officer T.M. Balakrishnan as the SEC, and forwarded the proposal to the L-G, who, in turn, insisted upon completing the process of delimitation of wards, before embarking upon the appointment of an SEC.

The delimitation process was completed, and the file relating to the appointment of SEC was forwarded to the L-G. This time, she decided to formulate a new scheme and constitute a selection committee for the appointment of SEC. An advertisement was also issued in a local Tamil daily, in July 2019, inviting applications for the post. But the Puducherry Legislative Assembly disapproved of such a course adopted by the L-G.

Consequently, the council of ministers went ahead with the appointment of Mr. Balakrishnan to the post, and he assumed charge on July 23, 2019. When things stood so, the Centre on December 18, 2019, ordered that selection of SEC for the U.T. should be made by calling for applications from across the country. Immediately, the L-G nullified the appointment of Mr. Balakrishnan, and issued an advertisement in all editions of The Hindu, inviting applications.

Contending that the act of the L-G was against the Constitution, and that the SEC should necessarily be appointed only based on the aid and advice of the council of ministers, Mr. Namassivayam accused Ms. Bedi of having tweaked the eligibility conditions in order to get her former advisor Theva Neethi Das appointed as the SEC. The Minister urged the court to declare as illegal the decisions taken by the L-G, as well as the Centre, on the issue of the appointment of SEC.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2wh0o8/article30637831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THBEDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/after-puducherry-cm-now-minister-files-case-against-bedi/article30637832.ece
224,2020/01/24,DVAC justifies non-registration of FIR against Minister Velumani,"The Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) on Thursday justified its act of having conducted a detailed preliminary inquiry, by recording statements of several witnesses and collecting various other materials, without registering a first information report against Municipal Administration Minister S. P. Velumani on two complaints of corrupt practices lodged against him regarding award of contracts by Chennai and Coimbatore corporations.

Appearing before Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha, who were seized of cases filed by R.S. Bharathi of DMK and Jayaram Venkatesan of Arappor Iyakkam seeking registration of FIR against the Minister, State Public Prosecutor A. Natarajan submitted a bulky preliminary inquiry report of the DVAC in a sealed cover. When the judges asked for statements of witnesses, he submitted yet another heavy sealed cover containing the statements.

Verdicts of SC

After opening the sealed covers in the court hall and glancing through their contents, the senior judge in the Bench said it prima facie appeared as if the police had conducted a regular investigation in the guise of conducting a preliminary inquiry. To this, SPP referred to several Supreme Court verdicts on the issue and contended that it was permissible for the police to conduct a detailed preliminary inquiry without registering a FIR.

Case-by-case basis

He cited a latest decision of the apex court delivered in December last in State of Telangana versus Managipet alias Mangipet Sarveshwar and claimed that it had clearly laid down the law that there could not be a set format for conducting preliminary inquiry. He also said, the manner and depth of the inquiry could be decided only on case-by-case basis. There was nothing wrong in conducting a preliminary inquiry like a full fledged investigation, he said. Mr. Natarajan also stated that the investigating officer would have the prerogative to decide how a preliminary inquiry should be conducted.

He also doubted the credentials of Mr. Venkatesan, Managing Trustee of the NGO Arappor Iyakkam, who had lodged the complaint against the minister and said, the complaint appeared to be motivated and made with the intention of maligning the reputation of the Minister.

After hearing him at length, the judges adjourned the cases to February 17 for hearing the arguments of Advocate General Vijay Narayan for the Chief Secretary, senior counsel C.S. Vaidyanathan for the Greater Chennai Corporation and senior counsel AR.L.

He was speaking at the Chamber Day celebrations of the Hindustan Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Pandiarajan highlighted the the trusteeship model of society that Mahatma Gandhi had propogated and said that entrepreneurs had a responsibility as trustees to give back to the society.

“You can give back through the products and services you offer, how you manufacture them as well as the professionalism you exhibit. There is also the traditional idea of corporate social responsibility (CSR) where you allocate a part of your surplus for the betterment of the society,” he said.

Congratulating Hindustan Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Pandiarajan said that he hoped for the spirit of Indian entrepreneurship to be celebrated more in the years to come.

Mr. Pandiarajan conferred the Champion of Humanity awards on K. P. Ramaswamy, chairman of KPR Group of companies, and R.P. Krishnammachari, chairman and managing director, Tex Biosciences Private Limited.

226,2020/01/24,CB-CID to probe scam in Group-IV examination,"The Crime Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police has launched an investigation into allegations that at least 40 candidates indulged in fraud to clear the Group-IV examination conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC).

The agency registered a case after Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy referred a formal complaint lodged by the TNPSC to probe the matter. The allegation is that the answer scripts of the suspected candidates were tampered with in Rameswaram and Keelakarai centres in Ramanathapuram district.

Following allegations that candidates who appeared from these centres figured in the top 100 ranks, an internal enquiry conducted by the TNPSC revealed that 57 candidates, of which 40 belonged to other districts, had qualified for verification of certificates from these two centres. The examination was held in nine centres in Ramanathapuram district and the suspected candidates appeared in different centres.

At the CB-CID headquarters, DGP M.S. Jaffar Sait reviewed the case with senior officers and formed a special team led by a Deputy Superintendent of Police to apprehend the suspected kingpin and his associates. Investigators would examine all the 40 suspected candidates and government officials who were on duty in Rameswaram and Keelakarai centres.

“While 57 candidates who appeared in Rameswaram and Keelakarai centres have cleared the exams with high scores, we are suspecting tampering of answer scripts in the case of 40 candidates. The role of State government staff who were in charge of the centres and handled the custody of the answer scripts is being verified,” a police officer said.

The Group-IV examination to fill up 6,491 vacancies was conducted on September 1, 2019 in which 16,29,865 candidates, including 7.18 lakh women, 16,601 differently abled candidates and 4,973 destitute widows, appeared at 5,575 centres across in the State.

Venkaiah Naidu on Thursday said that the time had come to revisit Indian history textbooks andthey must highlight the life stories of national icons like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Veer Savarkar who were not given due recognition.

Unveiling a 6-ft-tall bronze statue of Netaji Subash Chandra Bose at the Raj Bhavan in Chennai, the Vice President said it was unfortunate that the lives of Indian freedom fighters have not been given enough prominence in textbooks.

Governor Banwarilal Purohit said that Netaji proved to be an intellectual of high order and a person with incredible spiritual energy that he used to convert his efforts into something absolutely sublime.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami recalled Netaji’s close association with Tamil Nadu and howhe loved the Tamil people and wished to be born as a Tamilian in his next birth. Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam also spoke.

The bronze statue, made by sculptor Jagannathan Nagappa, was sponsored by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (BVB). Speaker P. Dhanapal, Chairman of BVB’s Chennai Kendra and publisher of The Hindu N.

229,2020/01/24,HC comes to rescue of domestic violence victims,"The Madras High Court on Thursday ordered that judicial magistrates across the State need not insist upon Domestic Incidence Report (DIR) from the designated Protection Officers under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act of 2005 and thereby delay taking cognisance of applications filed by victim women.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha passed the order on a public interest litigation petition by advocate Sudha Ramalingam, former vice-president of People’s Union for Civil Liberties, complaining about various shortcomings in effective implementation of the Act and the need to train judicial officers as well as other stakeholders.

Accepting the submission of the petitioner’s counsel B. Poongkuzhali that the victim women could not be made to wait for months together for receipt of DIRs, the judges directed the High Court Registry to issue a circular in that regard to all judicial officers across the State after obtaining necessary orders from the Chief Justice.

In her affidavit, the petitioner had said that Section 12(1) of the Act permits every aggrieved woman to approach the magistrate concerned either directly or through the jurisdictional PO.

Nevertheless, most of the magistrates insist on DIRs from the POs before entertaining the victim’s applications and it causes huge delay, she claimed.

“Mechanical forwarding of every application to the protection officer for the preparation of the DIR is against the language and purpose of Section 12 and there is an imminent need for guidelines in this regard and training to the magistrates and the protection officers regarding the same,” she said.

Though the Act provides for disposing of applications within 60 days, in practice, it takes about three months for a magistrate to even take cognisance of the case, the petitioner claimed and urged the High Court to issue clear guidelines on the subject to the judicial officers across the State.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-comes-to-rescue-of-domestic-violence-victims/article30637796.ece

231,2020/01/24,Final report sought in case relating to H. Raja’s remark,"The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Thirumayam police, in Pudukkottai district, to file a final report on the investigation into the incident where BJP national secretary H. Raja made a derogatory remark against the High Court.

Justice A.D. Jagadish Chandira directed the Thirumayam police to file the report in two months. The court was hearing the petition filed by advocate S. Doraisamy, who sought a direction to the police to file a final report in the case.

He pointed out that Mr. Raja had entered into an altercation with the Thirumayam police, after they had denied BJP cadre from erecting a stage in the middle of the road during Vinayaka Chathurthi celebrations, in 2018. The police had denied permission, citing a High Court order.

However, Mr. Raja asked his supporters to go ahead and erect the stage, while verbally abusing the police, calling them corrupt, even offering to pay bribe in public. Mr. Raja also went on to pass derogatory remark against the High Court, the petitioner added.

The court took suo motu criminal contempt of the incident, that went viral and caught media attention. But his apology was generously accepted by the High Court, and the contempt petition was closed. Following criticism from the public, the Thirumayam police booked a case against Mr. Raja.

Yet, till date, the police have not taken action against Mr. Raja. The police fear Mr. Raja’s affiliation to the BJP, the petitioner said. With the video of the incident having gone viral, the police cannot claim that the case was falsely filed and close the complaint, the petitioner added.

232,2020/01/24,HC takes up suo motu PIL against use of educational institution premises for commercial gains,"The Madras High Court on Thursday took up a suo motu public interest litigation petition (PIL) intended at preventing private educational institutions, which avail concessions in payment of electricity charges and property taxes, from renting out their premises for non-educational activities with the motive of making money.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha directed Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan to take notice on behalf of the State government and ascertain its response by February 26. Notices were also ordered to Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) and Greater Chennai Corporation.

The suo motu PIL had been taken on the basis of a reference made by Justice N. Kirubakaran on November 24, 2016. Though the reference was made three years ago, the Registry had put up a note before Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi only recently. After being convinced with reasons assigned for the delay, he referred the issue to the PIL committee.

The 2016 reference by Justice Kirubakaran was made while refusing to entertain a case filed by S. Sujitha, who claimed to be a journalist working for a television channel, to prevent South Indian Artistes Association, popularly known as Nadigar Sangam, from conducting its Annual General Body meeting at the Loyola College auditorium in Nungambakkam here.

Then the judge had doubted the bonafide of the writ petitioner and therefore refused to entertain the case. However, he was of the view that the larger issue of educational institutions using their premises for commercial gains should be taken up by the court as a public interest litigation petition and sufficient guidelines should be framed on the issue.

He pointed out that Tangedco charges only ₹3.15 for every unit of power consumed by educational institutions as against ₹11 per unit charged for temporary power supply for construction activities. Therefore, institutions which avail such subsidies from government utilities should use their premises strictly for educational activities alone, he had opined.

Since Loyola College and Nadigar Sangam were parties in the writ petition in which the single judge had made the reference, the Division Bench led by Justice Sathyanarayanan included them as respondents in the suo motu PIL petition too and ordered notices to them.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-takes-up-suo-motu-pil-against-use-of-educational-institution-premises-for-commercial-gains/article30637676.ece

Rama Rao in particular should take immediate steps to prevent further environmental degradation of the twin cities with water bodies totally polluted and encroached while the municipal solid waste collection as well as disposal floundering before luring investors, said the Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday.

“The Minister has been active in the World Economic Summit (WES) in Davos aggressively marketing Hyderabad whereas the reality is the Telangana High Court and the National Green Tribunal (NGT) have pulled up the government for pollution of lakes and shoddy garbage collection,” charged senior leader Karuna Gopal at a press conference.

She claimed that the twin cities has also reached a state of ‘ICU’ because of the extent of toxicity present in the water bodies where cadmium levels have reached an all time high. This, along with the manner of collection and disposal of the municipal solid waste will only lead to rise in communicable and non-communicable diseases among the people.

“The Minister has been at the helm of affairs for many years now and has been doing just cosmetic surgery. There is a danger of the city being turned from a ‘Bhagyanagar’ to an ‘Abhagyanagar’. There is nothing wrong in inviting more pharma firms but there should be similar efforts to clean up. It is regrettable that the Pollution Control Board (PCB) checks pollution levels of just 17 lakes when we have up to 4,000 water bodies,” she charged.

The water bodies in and around the city are not only polluted and encroached upon with dwellings, the largescale presence of water hyacinth is an indication that the household sewage is freely flowing into them. “There has been no effort to control flow of industrial effluents either and the assurance of putting up sewage treatment plants plus effluent treatment plants have not fructified,” the BJP leader pointed out.

“This is an uncaring and irresponsible government. No one knows what happened to the hundreds of crores of rupees received in aid for cleaning up Hussainsagar and other lakes but there are attempts to dilute the GO 111 to destroy Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes,” she charged.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2yzoal/article30646098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy25karunagopal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/clean-up-city-first-before-inviting-investments-says-bjp/article30646099.ece

They entered the temple of the serpent god, the clan god of the Boigutta branch of the Mesram Raj Gonds and Pardhans of former composite Adilabad district, giving a solemn start to the rituals associated with the start of the famous annual Nagoba jatara also known as Keslapur jatara after the village in Indervelli mandal where the even takes place.

The temple for which a new structure is coming up is dedicated to the serpent god, known as Shri Shek to the aboriginal people, and is the centre of all activities during the week long festivities.

Maha puja

The rituals here are associated with puja of Nagoba, the high points being the maha puja which was participated by Collector D. Divya, Superintendent of Police Vishnu S. Warrier and Project Officer of Integrated Tribal Development Agency, Utnoor, S. Krishna Aditya signalling the start of jatara on Friday night.

One of the most important part of the jatara, which followed the maha puja, was ‘bheting’ or introduction of the new brides in the clan to the clan god. It, however, took place in the small hours of Saturday.

The run up to the maha puja also saw some interesting cultural aspects of the ethnic tribes all along the day. Soon after entering the temple with the ‘jhari’ or the sacred brass container in which the Adivasis had earlier fetched holy gangajal or water from Godavari from Hastinamadugu in Jannaram mandal of Mancherial district, the clan members greeted elders with the ‘ram-ram’ salutation and offered a pinch of tobacco as a mark of respect.

Customary roles

The Mesram clan women who had been married into other clans were then handed over the sacred earthen pots to fetch water from the holy open well under the wad marra. The women with pots on their heads and walking single file made for a spectacle.

The water was used to make sacred ant hill, the abode of the serpent god.

Further, the Telangana associations’ office-bearers said the Supreme Court had also refused to entertain the request of AP managements to direct their Telangana counterparts to pay the salaries of 655 employees relieved by Telangana based on the final report of the Dharmadhikari Committee. The apex court told the petitioners to move the one-man committee on the payment of salaries of the employees relieved by Telangana.

The apex court gave a direction to the one-man committee headed by D.M. Dharmadhikari, a former judge of the Supreme Court, to settle the matter at the earliest.

Chandrasekhar Rao has sanctioned ₹ 75 crore for the arrangements for historic Sammakka Sarakka Jatara to be held at Medaram to ensure hassle free pilgrimage for devotees, said ministers Errabelli Dayakar Rao and Srinivas Goud.

The ministers wanted the officials of district administration to see that sanitation is good and roads are free for the devotees to reach the venue. The temporary toilets constructed for the jatara were being utilized by the lakhs of people who were already thronging the jatara site to avoid last minute rush and their upkeep was poor. “The toilets should be clean with daily maintenance. Till last day, they should be kept in proper shape,” the ministers told the officials.

Mr. Dayakar Rao and Mr. Srinivas Goud earlier inaugurated the Tourism Cottages at Tadvai mandal headquarters near Medaram Jatara. The facility has got 12 cottages with 30 rooms, restaurant, tribal products and artefacts display, gazebos, parking and pathways, landscaping and solar lighting. The facility was thrown open for the devotees coming for Medaram Jatara.

Tourist destination

“Since this place in amid thick forest, it will be developed into a tourist attraction. We appeal to people to make it a plastic free jatara and properly utilize the facilities with a sense of belongingness,” the ministers said addressing the newsmen.

Later, they visited the Medaram village and went round the place inspecting ongoing arrangements — drinking water taps, toilets, lighting, roads, accommodation among others. They held a review meeting with District Collector V. Venkateswarlu and heads of all government departments and NGO representatives involved in the jatara arrangements.

Growing popularity

The officials were told to be prepared to handle the rush and also be prepared with alternate plans in case of any exigency. As the jatara got enormous publicity, more and more people were arriving to witness and take part in the rituals. “Already over one lakh people are coming on Saturday and Sundays.

244,2020/01/24,India-UK joint research meeting at ICRISAT,"Over a hundred scientists from varied disciplines gathered at the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) to discuss an India-UK joint research programme for more interdisciplinary research to make Indian agriculture sustainable in a changing world and to ensure food security.

The first General Assembly of TIGR2ESS (Transforming India’s Green Revolution by Research and Empowerment for Sustainable Food Supplies), an UK-India research programme, which began in 2018 and brought over 20 research institutions together, concluded at ICRISAT on Friday. The programme was from January 20-24, where crop scientists, sociologists, biologists, nutrition experts and archaeologists, among others, discussed the way ahead.

“The General Assembly is an important milestone for TIGR2ESS, affording us an opportunity to strengthen the interdisciplinary nature of our research and put in place plans with tangible outcomes for positive agricultural and socio-economic change in India,” said professor Howard Griffiths, principal investigator for the programme and University of Cambridge’s advocate in Cambridge-India relations.

The programme seeks to address four key research questions: What should an Evergreen Revolution deliver? Can crop productivity increase, whilst maintaining yield stability? Can water supplies be shared to match community demand? How can we best engage and educate for local community well-being?

These questions were being answered by six distinct but fully integrated, flagship projects which are heavily reliant on research collaborations, exchanges and women empowerment.

Rajeev Gupta, a co-lead in Flagship Project 2, noted that multidisciplinary approach of TIGR2ESS is crucial for India’s Green Revolution to reach the next level.

“Screening of several hundred lines of sorghum and pearl millet for water use efficiency is among the many areas where the project has made progress since its inception,” Dr. Gupta, a principal scientist at ICRISAT who oversees genomics and crop trait discovery, said.

“India is among the top producers in dairy, rice, wheat and pulses. It has seen around two percent productivity gains in crops like pearl millet owing to hybridization and the private sector. In Africa, the productivity is either stable or declining. Why are we lagging so far in Africa?” asked Peter Carberry, Director General, ICRISAT, while emphasizing the need for transferring the learnings and successes from the programme to sub-Saharan Africa.

To strengthen collaboration between India and the UK’s scientific institutions and to build research capacity, over 50 early career researchers, from both within and beyond TIGR2ESS, are receiving training in key research skills, from writing research grant applications to deep learning with artificial intelligence during the Assembly. To further strengthen collaboration, specifically in agriculture research, he announced a fellowship programme that will soon be rolled out with India’s Department of Biotechnology (DBT) and the National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR). The fellowship will facilitate 30 Indian researchers to undertake research work at crop science universities in the UK for two years.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hq2jnv/article30647401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-ICRI-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/india-uk-joint-research-meeting-at-icrisat/article30645263.ece
245,2020/01/24,It pays to take up sericulture: Minister,"Agriculture Minister S Nirajan Reddy said sericulture would be beneficial and farmers from Telangana had proved this. Technical knowledge would be an added advantage in farming, he said.

Participating in a state-level meeting of sericulture farmers, along with Finance Minister T. Harish Rao, held here Friday, Mr. Niranjan Reddy said the government had been according top priority to sericulture.

Revenue from mango cultivation on 4 lakh acres stood at ₹1,100 crore, while in sericulture, the revenue was ₹1,400 crore from 11,000 acres and urged the farmers to observe the difference.

“Unemployed youth can focus on sericulture. The revenue is far better than a software job. Farmers are saying this has been their experience in the past five years. I am also going to take up sericulture on 15 acres. Sheds can be constructed at low cost and farmers need not worry about this,” said Mr. Niranjan Reddy, adding that micro irrigation equipment would be supplied to farmers after March.

Kaleshwaram water

The Agriculture Minsiter said that construction of the Kaleshwaram project for two tmcft was completed in a record time with the initiative of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and Finance Minister T Harish Rao and work was under progress for another tmcft.

Mr. Harish Rao said the government had spent about ₹1,000 crore for construction of godowns, and supply of free powera, agriculture instruments and tractors.

Stating that about 35 per cent of the budget was being spent on the farming sector, the Minister said investment on sericulture would yield returns for about 15 years.

248,2020/01/24,India’s new museum makers,"“India mein museum kaun jata hai? (who goes to a museum in India),” asks a public awareness initiative, #chalomuseum, rolled out by the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art last year. Not many, despite having over 170 museums across the country. We’d rather plan visits to the Louvre, the MET or the Guggenheim. But that is slowly changing.

Fresh approaches are making a difference: like The Heritage Lab’s 2019 campaign, These Mughal Women, where people were invited, through contests, to share an object from a museum related to women in the Mughal court. Or new spaces, such as the interactive Indian Music Experience museum in Bengaluru, where you can tap, hum into and interact with musical installations. “World over, museums have been colonial projects, categorising and organising subjects in different ways. But new museums are designed as experiences rather than a collection of objects because they’ve come up in the technology-driven, social media age,” says Parmesh Shahani, head of Godrej India Culture Lab.

Today, a pop-up museum can be as deep and meaningful as a permanent one, he asserts, reflecting the times we are living in, where Instagram stories are no less important than posts. “Both pop-up and permanent museums are re-imagining subjectivity, agency, and democratising the idea of a museum — through exhibition design, architecture and their participatory nature,” he adds, pointing to their own three-day ‘Museum of Memories: Remembering Partition’ pop-up in Mumbai, which had packed in collaborative exhibitions (including one with crowd-sourced objects).

The birth of private museums is also a welcome change in a landscape dotted with government-owned institutions, says textile designer and curator Mayank Mansingh Kaul. “The latter offer limited opportunities to a new generation of curators. And they often have their own permanent collections, restricting their ability to host travelling exhibitions. New museums can help fill these gaps,” he says.

Moreover, at a time when the country’s rich, multi-layered history is being bulldozed by a saffron agenda, and people’s very identities are being called into question, museums are the ideal spaces to look back at our shared yet diverse roots, and celebrate how India is a mix of many.

Here are some of the country’s new and upcoming museums and their makers.

Wendell Rodricks

Moda Goa Museum & Research Centre, Goa | Opening: March 28

There’s a new destination to add to your Goa checklist of beaches and the Basilica of Bom Jesus — India’s first costume museum. Housed in a 450-year-old Goan mansion, Casa Dona Maria, in Colvale, with ochre yellow walls and a red tiled roof, it will showcase 800-plus artefacts — from a 1913 wedding dress to a gold coin minted by the Knights of Malta in the 16th century — across 15 themed galleries.

One of the designer’s favourites: an exquisite set of 24-carat gold bangles, studded with spinels, dating from Portuguese India over 300 years ago. “The gold is so pure that when you hold them, you can feel them crunch,” says Rodricks. The fine filigree work highlights the craftsmanship of Goan goldsmiths (belonging to the Daivadnya Brahmin caste) — the first Indians to be taken across the seas to Lisbon to make jewellery for the Portuguese court.

Rodricks has been procuring objects, photographs, costumes and jewellery since 1998, from auctions, jewellers and private donations — like the swimsuit worn by former model Reita Faria when she won the 1966 Miss World or a pano bhaju (worn by women performing the Goan folk dance, Mando) from Lisbon. In fact, an entire gallery is dedicated to the latter, tracing the blouse-jacket-sarong costume’s origins along the Silk Route. “It was adorned with jewellery, influenced perhaps by the Peranakan Chinese ladies who came to Goa. I have a 200-year-old one,” he says. Another gallery, named Celebration, features Kunbi saris, the weave Rodricks revived.

Page turner | Photo Credit: Vinsan Academy of Film and Media

The museum grew from Rodricks’ 2012 book, Moda Goa: History and Style, which packed in his 10-year research and experiences at two internships (The Museum at FIT, New York, and National Costume Museum, Lisbon). The idea of a costume museum came to him while pursuing the latter, but he “had no idea about the logistics”. His desire to leave behind a legacy and “an obscenely grand offer” for Casa Dona Maria — where he’d lived with his partner, Jerome Marrel, their four dogs and three cats — led him to move into a smaller space and repurpose the house.

Currently, curators are being trained to offer private tours and, after the launch, the Fashion Design Council of India (FDCI) will host four temporary exhibitions through the year.

Museum of Art and Photography, Bengaluru | Opening: End of 2020

Industrialist and art collector Abhishek Poddar’s new project is touted to be the ‘museum of the future’, with interactive touch screens, smart tablets, holographic tables, VR technology, digital art galleries and more.

“Being in Bengaluru, it is only right that the Museum of Art and Photography (MAP) aims to make itself the most technologically-advanced museum in the country,” says the founder-trustee. The 42,000-sq ft space, scheduled to open by the end of the year, aims to break the notion that museums are dull and, instead, show that art is “fun, hands-on and not elitist”.

Under the directorship of curator Kamini Sawhney, its five galleries will host permanent and temporary exhibitions. “MAP isn’t just a museum of objects but a space for ideas and conversations that will be initiated through these objects. So, art becomes a tool to connect with people,” says Sawhney, adding that the artefacts range from pre-modern, modern and contemporary, to textiles and craft, and folk and tribal, “so as to reach out to every section of the audience”.

A mid-20th century brocade skirt

Spread across five floors — with an auditorium, research library, restoration lab, a museum store and cafe — a ₹10 crore grant by tech company Mphasis is also helping the museum take on a 360-degree approach. The plan to make the space inclusive and accessible goes beyond ramps and wheelchair-friendly restrooms, to include tactile tiles for the visually-impaired, hearing enhancement systems, and a quiet room for those who struggle with being in crowded places.

A part of Poddar’s collection now rests at MAP, which has over 18,000 artworks, largely from the subcontinent and spanning from the 12th century to the present. Unusual objects include a mid-20th century brocade skirt (“the lower section depicts the tricolour”), and a Hindu mobile shrine that can be operated with a key. Donations by other collectors include Asian Silk Route jewels — headdresses and earrings to gaus (small amulet cases) from Afghanistan, Tibet and Bhutan — and 82 vintage textiles from Gujarat. What’s drawing Poddar’s eye now? “I find myself gravitating more towards classical art; this is what is anchoring me more these days.”

Pavithra Muddaya

Museum of Living Textiles, Bengaluru | Opened: Last July

Every week, textile designer Pavithra Muddaya, 61, receives donations: half-a-century-old saris that were family heirlooms. The latest is a luminous silk with the chinar leaf motif woven in regular and jamdani weaves. “The dual technique is interesting,” she says.

Launched last July, the 1,300-sq ft space — above her residence in Victoria Layout — is an extension of Vimor, a heritage sari label co-founded by Muddaya and her mother, Chimmy Nanjappa, in 1974. “Most museums focus on textiles commissioned by royalty. This honours a common man’s living memories [from two generations back to today],” she says. The collection includes not only silks and cottons from the bigger states such as Tamil Nadu and Varanasi, but also unidentified designs from smaller regions (sourced from Muddaya’s personal archives and donations by customers). Highlights include a datthi seere — a 3.15 metre drape woven for children — a Chanderi that’s 64-inches wide, and a pre-Partition phulkari.

Many saris also reflect a marriage of two states: a fish motif from Madhya Pradesh woven in Andhra or a Manipuri puja sari with roots in Tamil Nadu. This reflects “our robust trade and migration, and help the younger generation understand that saris are our shared heritage”.

The museum also has an interactive wall for visitors to share crafts knowledge and textile memories. “I recently learnt that the palanquin tassels from North Karnataka were once exported to Germany,” she concludes.

Tarang Arora

Amrapali Museum, Jaipur | Opened: 2018

Two weeks ago, Tarang Arora came across a pair of 19th-century jhumkas. Their fine workmanship caught his eye and he picked them up. “The jewels you see today aren’t as exquisite as [those from] earlier times,” he says. The vice president and creative director of Amrapali Jewels is merely following in the footsteps of his father, Rajiv Arora, and friend, Rajesh Ajmera — the brand’s co-founders — who often returned from their travels across India with beautiful artefacts such as a jade book stand (below) or a gem-studded back scratcher with a hidden blade. They had worried that they wouldn’t see such workmanship for much longer, “as people were getting rid of it at pawn shops and with bullion dealers”.

In 2018, over 3,000 of these pieces, collected over 35 years, found a permanent home at the museum, with a focus on tribal jewellery. “Indian jewellery is much more than what the Maharajas wore,” says Arora, picking out artefacts like a waistband from Calicut (above), studded with coins, that tells the story of how nomadic tribes wore wealth on their body because they were always on the move.

The museum’s collection is pan-Indian, and includes everything from silver and gold jewellery to “numerous inspirations for design that have been available to Indian craftsmen”, such as silver objects. Highlights include chuskis or wine flasks from 19th century Jaipur modelled on dancing figures, gold earrings worn by tribal women in Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu, and a collection of mukhnaals or gold and silver hookah mouthpieces used by maharajas. Arora now plans to document the collection in a series of books.

₹600 (includes a free audio tour guide). At Ashok Marg; open from 11 am to 6 pm. Details: amrapalimuseum.com

Vikas Khanna

Museum of Culinary Arts, Manipal | Opened: 2018

For a New York-based Michelin-star chef to curate a museum on Indian kitchens is no mean feat. Overcoming procuring challenges, and “booking over a dozen flights to India”, Vikas Khanna has managed to populate the Museum of Culinary Arts with nearly 2,000 objects. “Many families email me when they wish to sell their old utensils or if they discover something,” he says.

Housed in the premises of his alma mater, Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration in Karnataka, and spread over three floors, the museum offers insights into how food was stored and cooked, and the metals used to make the vessels. The items include a 21-piece metal royal picnic set, weighing scales from Kochi and Kashmir, seed sprinklers, etc. The artefacts also reflect ancient wisdoms. In Khajuraho, he found utensils made of clay mixed with neem leaves to protect grains from insects.

The museum’s pieces will travel overseas — on loan to international museums (much like he carried his grandmother’s iron kadhai when he first travelled to the US in 2000). His 2018 book, Patra, was published to document the exhibits here. “This museum is helping utensils get a second chance to live,” says Khanna, who hopes to house 10,000 objects in the museum.

Entry by prior appointment. Open from 9 am to 5 pm (Monday to Saturday). Details: manipal.edu/mu.html

249,2020/01/24,Delhi printmaker Anupam Sud has her first retrospective in New York,"She was the youngest member of Group 8, a Delhi collective of printmakers that her professor and printmaker Jagmohan Chopra brought together back in 1968. Today, 75-year-old Delhi-based Anupam Sud, has her works showing in the United States, in a retrospective hosted at the Delhi-based DAG’s New York gallery.

Her last major showing, called Anupam Sud: A Retrospective, was over a decade ago, at the Palette Gallery in Mumbai. This current one, which will travel to DAG’s space in Mumbai over the summer and to KNMA in Delhi later this year, is curated by printmaker and former student of Sud’s, Paula Sengupta. “The last 10-12 years is really the thrust of this exhibition,” Sengupta says, adding that Sud, unlike a lot of her peers who came into their own in their 50s, really peaked only in the last decade or so. This, despite acknowledging that the artist is known mostly for her works from the 1970s and ’80s.

Sud, whose works have always focussed on the human body, shorn of all adornments including hair, has in the last decade, “moved increasingly to fluid spaces, spaces of androgyny, gender ambiguity, and alongside heterosexual relationships, she’s explored homo-social behaviour, alternative spaces, of which, from an early stage in her career, there have been glimpses,” Sengupta says.

Olympia, 2007: “It takes off from earlier European masters’ rendering of the nude Olympia, who was very much an object of the male gaze. But here, both are showing themselves off to each other. It completely topples all notions of the gaze that we’ve traditionally harboured,” says Sengupta. | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Fittingly therefore called The Soul (Un) Gendered: Anupam Sud, A Retrospective, the showing’s selections include 130 works spanning five decades, and is a collaboration between DAG (formerly Delhi Art Gallery) and the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA). “Standing in 2020, I’ve been able to look back from a position of vantage, and that’s given me a complete reading,” says Sengupta.

Artistic concerns

However, Sud, who had earned a Commonwealth scholarship to study at the Slade School of Fine Art, London in 1971, isn’t entirely happy with her first New York retrospective. “It’s like you’ve hidden my colourful plumes and shown the crow’s feathers with which I learnt to fly,” she says after hesitation, one afternoon at the DAG’s new space in central Delhi.

This has to do, somewhat, with the fact that of the 130 works selected for the show, only 90 are on display in New York currently.

Sengupta states paucity of space as one of the reasons for this tight edit, but adds that since “DAG acquired all these at the fag end of her career, they picked up what they could find. So a lot of her work form the ’80s has been sold out, with only proofs lying around. I can understand as a printmaker that you don’t want to put a proof print out there — but in the interest of establishing the narrative, I did exhibit some of these proof prints, because establishing the narrative was important in the curatorial process,” Sengupta clarifies. She has also written a detailed curatorial essay, which will be published in a book accompaniment to the exhibit when it comes to Mumbai. Also in the book will be an interview of the artist, by art historian and curator Lina Vincent.

Regardless, there seems to be a lot of interest in Sud’s works. Just over a month into the three-month long exhibit, KNMA has bought out the entire show. Additionally, the fact that the show opened directly in New York, only reinforces the familiarity that New York audiences have had with the Delhi-based artist’s works. She has, through various stages of her career worked at the Robert Blackburn Studio, Manhattan Graphics, and more.

“I found also that there is currently a lot of interest in [South Asian] women artists in general, in New York,” Sengupta says. For example, at the end of 2019, there was Phenomenal Nature, a retrospective of 50 works by sculptor Mrinalini Mukherjee at the Met Breuer, the modern and contemporary art museum that’s part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Currently at the Museum of Modern Art, there is Of All People, an atmospheric installation by Bengaluru-based Sheela Gowda.

Not disconnected

One of Sud’s biggest strengths is — her technical expertise notwithstanding — her major preoccupation with the concepts with which she engages. So much so that Sengupta admits that after a point in the late 1990s, it was a challenge to design the retrospective in a chronological fashion. Sud had constantly revisited some of her plates, adding and reworking not just colours and textures, but issue-based details, over and over.

“She’s responded to the Nirbhaya incident (2012 Delhi gang rape case), she’s engaged with the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks...her work has always been topical and therefore, continues to have resonance with today’s audiences,” says Sengupta.

Darling, Get Me A Baby Made, 1979: “It was the beginning of the days of artificial insemination. It is all around us now. In the work, I even depicted the first two doctors who had done this experiment; I had seen their photos in the newspaper,” says Sud. | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Through the interview, Sud apologises for being unable to remember details of her career and work. She pins this to the accident she had soon after the retrospective in Mumbai. It led to a brain haemorrhage that’s left lasting effects. Despite this, the once redoubtable academic who spent most of her career teaching at the College of Art, Delhi (she herself was a student there between 1963-67, before heading to Slade) Sud hasn’t lost her to-the-point demeanour that her students remember her for.

There is however, one episode of her own spunk that Sud clearly recalls: of unwittingly bullying Jagmohan Chopra, into starting Group 8. “The summer before graduating, I remember feeling lost and directionless. Where could I go to make prints now? It’s not like painting that you can do it without the machines and investment. So I asked Mr. Chopra: ‘Why do you teach this form if it has no future outside of the college?’ It seemed to have had impacted him, because over the summer he bought a machine and set up a makeshift studio in the living room of his house. The people who’d practice here came to be known as Group 8!”

250,2020/01/24,The other side of Duryodhana,"Ranga Shankara, which is celebrating its 15th anniversary this year, is hosting special performances every month including presentation of rare art forms. “We have one special theatrical experience every month, and these few showcase the full range of an art form,” says S Surendranath, the Artistic Director of Ranga Shankara.

On January 26, Ranga Shankara brings a Kutiyattam performance — one of India’s oldest living theatrical traditions and the only one to use ancient Sanskrit plays, states Surendranath. “Kutiyattam is practised in Kerala and rarely seen in Bengaluru,” he adds.

Kutiyattam exponent G Venu of Natanakairali from Kerala will direct and present Urubhangam (The broken thigh) an original by the playwright Bhasa. A visual and aural spectacle, a Kutiyattam performance has actors in exquisite costumes performing in the light of a large lamp that burns bright through out the performance.

“Special rhythm instruments that are specific to the genre such as mizhavu and idakka accompany the actors. The best among Kutiyattam and mizhavu exponents from Natanakairali are part of Urubhangam,” says Venu, who is looking forward to presenting the show to Bangaloreans. “Pothiyil Ranjith Chakyar (as Balarama), Sooraj Nambiar (as Duryodhana), Kapila Venu (as Gandhari) and Ammannur Rajaneesh Chakyar (as Ashwatthama) are in the cast. Rajeev, Hariharan and Narayanan Nambiar, all artistes from Kalamandalam will be on mizhavu, where as Kalanilayam Unnikrishnan will play the Idakka and Kalanilayam Haridas will be in charge of the elaborate make-up of the artistes,” he adds.

Speaking about the presentation, Surendranath says, written in 4th Century AD, Urubhangam is probably the first ever anti-war play of India. It is a true classic narrative that delineates the after-effects of war and simultaneously brings in the pain a person goes through. “Urubhangam is a coming together of a rich and traditional classical form.”

About its artistic, intellectual and social relevance, Venu says, among all Bhasa’s plays, Urubhangam has an eternal relevance cutting across centuries. “The hero is Duryodhana, usually regarded as the anti-hero, or the villain in all the traditional renderings of the Mahabharata. Not just that, the play maintains a unique objective perspective while approaching the epic battle that practically criticises the whole exercise,” he says.

The team analysed and studied the storyline of Urubhangam as part of the repertoire of Kutiyattam in the olden days. “During our research to produce this play on the stage, we read the text over and over again. Many possibilities and perspectives emerged as we burrowed into the insights available. The team of Abhinaya Kalari of Natanakairali, prepared the Attapraprakaram by deciding to present the whole play through just four characters, namely Balarama, Duryodhana, Gandhari and Aswathama.”

Urubhangam in Kutiyattam, by Natanakairali will be staged in Ranga Shankara on January 26 at 7.30 pm. Tickets available at the venue and bookmyshow.com",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/iontw4/article30644216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20bgm-kutiyattam1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/urghangam-g-venu/article30644219.ece
251,2020/01/24,India Art Fair 2020: To the fairgrounds,"With just five days to go, India’s biggest exhibition of contemporary and modern South Asian art is nearly ready to open its 12th edition. Installations and art works are being mounted and, with a steady rise in participation from international galleries, 2020 will see names like Aicon Contemporary, New York, Grosvenor Gallry, London, and PSM, Berlin. But Jagdip Jagpal — who took over as fair director in 2018, and is looking at expanding India’s art market by growing an interest in art — says that, as always, 70% of the floor space is reserved for Indian galleries. “[As long as] I’m here, that will never change,” she stresses.

This year, visitors can look forward to fresh artist programmes, a new lifestyle space, performance arts (don’t miss Lagos-based multimedia artist Jelili Atiku’s politically-charged Nobody is Born Wise), the Andy Warhol BMW Art Car — “it is pop art, and pop art has always been popular in India” — and an original painted facade. “We’ve commissioned Sameer Kulavoor, whose work engages with the lives of ordinary people, to paint the facade [covering almost two buildings], says Jagpal. “What he’s doing for the fair is a new work.”

Edited excerpts from an interview:

What kind of Indian art and artists are emerging as contenders in the global scene?

Over the past few years, galleries have had the confidence to promote both new and known artists. IAF is a platform where art is for sale, for viewing, and there’s grants, prizes, and residencies. In terms of art forms, the focus is on female and non-binary artists. In terms of form, textile art is growing in popularity, like artist Arshi Irshad Ahmadzai (who sketches faceless women on muslin, to focus on the absence of female agency in patriarchal societies). So are the photographic arts, along with the traditional mediums like oil on canvas, with artists like Ratheesh T, represented by Galerie Mirchandani + Steinruecke.

2020 edit Artists in residence: The new programme opens with workshops, displays and specialist workshops — from drawing to zine making — by artists such as Marcel Dzama, Renuka Rajiv, Manisha Parekh and Gagan Singh.

The new programme opens with workshops, displays and specialist workshops — from drawing to zine making — by artists such as Marcel Dzama, Renuka Rajiv, Manisha Parekh and Gagan Singh. New addition: The museum retail space, Bookshop & Cafe, will offer everything from art books and zines to artist-designed lifestyle products. The Learning Space (in the bookshop) will host workshops, screenings and the like.

It is your third year at the helm. What has defined your approach?

The main thing is to put the artist’s voice at the centre of the art fair. We don’t have talks where the curator’s point of view is in focus. There are also no panels; the idea is to have case-study style discussions. For example, we have Nilima Sheikh, who will be in conversation with Sneha Ragavan of the Asia Art Archive [the artist will talk about her trips to Himalayan villages and how that has informed her art practices].

Your experience of the art market?

It has been a slow and steady growth, and because of that, particularly with contemporary art, we are seeing a steady increase in the number of younger collectors — in the mid-price range — buying contemporary. This is replacing luxury purchases, and I think this is also the reason that galleries are taking risks, and [acquiring] purely based on quality. We don’t have peaks and troughs, and I think that’s important.

Pooja Singhal, of Pichvai Tradition and Beyond — an atelier that contemporises and promotes traditional pichvai techniques — is participating for the first time. “We are a traditional art form, and to take part in this contemporary fair helps to mainstream it,” she says. “It is a big step forward for the survival and relevance of the work [commercial revival of heritage art] that people like me are doing. My booth is also quite contemporary. For instance, I’ve changed the colour palette of the pieces to play with pastels instead of the deep, traditional colours.

252,2020/01/24,Kerala exhibition of drawings captures man’s exploitative approach towards Nature,"Artist Vincent S feels simple lines and squiggles can speak as loud as elaborate strokes. His ongoing solo exhibition of drawings and sketches in the city perhaps bears testimony to his craft. Using pen and ink on paper as his “intimate medium”, Vincent chiefly attempts to capture “the modern-day man and his avaricious exploits”, especially his relation with Nature, through 200-odd works.

Black is the chosen shade for most of his works on display. “The colour assumes multiple levels of meaning depending on the subject and the context. It can signify both a state of mind and the state of affairs,” says Vincent, a native of Kanjiramkulam.

Despite trading the smudgy sweep of brush strokes for the controlled exactitude of pen, Vincent embeds his pieces with a high level of detailing, often leaving hardly any room for ‘white spaces’ in several of the works. He achieves this artistic refinement with a deft combination of “different types of dots, lines, curls and swirls” apart from careful ink smudges that lend the impression of water colours. He says the drawings depict his “change in his artistic sensibilities” spanning the last 35 years.

A contrasting take of forests and leafless trees appear as a leitmotif in his works, something Vincent says represents “loss and privation that masquerade as the trajectory of human progress”, while quickly referencing the ongoing Australian bushfire crisis. “The course has been from being hunter-gatherers heavily depended on forests and wildlife to flagrant nature exploiters turning a blind eye to the present and the posterity,” says Vincent, who’s currently doing Masters at the College of Fine Arts.

One highlight is the “needle art”, wherein subjects and details are traced using a needle upon fresh paintings. Abstract pieces on seascape, cricket and a mother-son duo form part of the works done using this technique. A drawing on the aftermath of cyclone Ockhi centres on the theme of survival. “Whether man or animal, survival is a basic instinct. It’s both primal and primary,” says Vincent, who founded Ananda Kala Kendram in Kanjiramkulam, an institution for painting and sculpture.

Another distinct work is a “new media experimental” piece that shows a composite of three separate drawings pieced together on the same frame, the whole of which is then pasted on a blown-up photograph depicting raging fire in the background.

Vincent says he has not given titles to any of his works as a conscious choice. “I would like to leave the interpretation to the viewer who is free to come up with his/her own,” he adds.

253,2020/01/24,Indian Garbage Collective makes art from junkyard finds,"Kaviya P loves dragonflies. In fact, she is more than a little obsessed with them: all her art revolves around their shapes, structures and flight patterns. A case in point is the four-feet-long blue dragonfly that hovered under a tree for three days this month, at The Road To GIF music festival in YMCA’s green grounds in Nandanam.

What stood out about the Blue Dragon (as the installation is named) was not its size, blue colour or bloodshot red eyes, but the fact that it was made entirely from salvaged scrap material — cloth, nylon rope, discarded car window shades, wires and anything else they could pick up in and around the venue. That is the distinguishing feature in all the art that 21-year-old Kaviya makes with her friends R Keerthana (21), Vishnu Nair (23), and Karthik Sethumaran (22). They call themselves the Indian Garbage Collective.

Though they live in different cities (Vishnu is based in Bengaluru, while the others are in Kumbakonam), they meet regularly to put up art installations at festivals, college events and even retail spaces in different cities. They are part of the Madras Art Guild (a public art festival in VR Chennai) for the second year in a row, and will be unveiling their art along with a host of other artistes at VR Chennai this Friday. With the theme for the year being sustainability, this team of four fits right in.

“The idea behind all our work is to highlight what people fail to see in the things they throw away, especially when we know that our garbage has such a large impact on the planet,” explains Vishnu. Blue Dragon, for instance, is made of joyously blue bales of cloth found in a rubbish heap. Another installation, called Cradle, was made by the team last year, out of saris “collected from mothers in Kumbakonam,” says Karthik. The two-storey-high expanse, emerald blue on one side and gorgeous purple on the other, had childhood memories painted along its length.

“We bring our individual, personal reflections into the things we collect,” he adds, “Each art is the vision of any one person. The rest of them help that person create it.” Cradle was created to Karthik’s vision and Blue Dragon to Kaviya’s. Keerthana came up with a piece called Network, which looks into the flow of distracting conversations through the metaphor of a spider in a web made of old wire and circuit boards. Vishnu, on the other hand, takes credit for Mad Town, a comment on urbanisation that they made out of discarded architecture projects in Kozhikode. “It was part of NIT Calicut’s annual festival Adizya. They were about to throw out architecture models made of styrofoam, which is not recyclable.” The team asked the college not to throw it out, and instead piled them all together chaotically, to reflect the nature of city life.

So far, the team has put up about 30 art installations in Kochi, Kozhikode, Kumbakonam, Chennai and other cities. All of them are made from scrap that is strictly local, and preferably hyperlocal. “We try to work with things we find in and around the building or at least in the neighbourhood,” says Vishnu. All in the spirit of sustainability.

Minister of State for Road Transport and Highways General (retd.) V. K. Singh was also present.

Mr. Gadkari said the expressway would prove to be a “growth engine” for the region with logistics, educational and health hubs coming up alongside it and also create job opportunities for the youth.

‘Electric highway’

The Minister added that he also had a dream to convert the expressway into an “electric highway” like those in the European countries with buses and trucks running with electric cables.

The Minister said a National Highways Authority of India portal was also launched on Thursday to expedite and bring greater transparency into the decision-making process.

He said that 22 Greenfield Corridors of 7,500 km length were being developed. These projects were being pursued vigorously and implemented on priority.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1pvkak/article30646778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24-GADKARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/work-awarded-for-delhi-mumbai-expressway/article30646779.ece
256,2020/01/24,BJP boycotts Rajasthan Governor’s address,"The Opposition BJP on Friday boycotted the customary address of Governor Kalraj Mishra in the Rajasthan Assembly on the first day of its session, which is set to be extended for presentation of the State budget. The BJP members accused the Congress government of flouting the rules for convening the session.

The session was called mainly to pass a resolution against the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The Assembly will also ratify the Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill passed by Parliament last month for extending the reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies by another 10 years.

As soon as the House assembled and Mr. Mishra started delivering his address, Leader of the Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria raised objection over the session having been called without a prior notice of 21 days. He said the session had been “hurriedly convened” to meet the deadline for ratification of the Amendment Bill by January 25.

‘Lack of prompt action’

Interrupting the Governor’s speech, Mr. Kataria said the State government wanted to save itself from embarrassment over the lack of prompt action after the Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on December 12, 2019. “The government woke up suddenly and decided to call the session without giving sufficient time to the members to make preparations,” he said.

The BJP MLAs raised slogans and staged a walkout, as Mr. Mishra, unfazed by the disorder, continued to deliver his speech. Mr. Mishra highlighted the steps being taken by the State government to redress people’s grievances, promote industrial development, control the crime rate and strengthen the agriculture sector by extending the benefits of various schemes to the farmers.

The resolution against implementation of the CAA will be introduced and debated in the House on Saturday. The Cabinet was giving a final shape to the resolution, according to sources in the Chief Minister's Office.

Locusts in Assembly

BJP MLA from Nokha Bihari Lal carried a basket full of locusts inside the Assembly building with the demand for expediting the distribution of compensation to the farmers whose crops were damaged on a large scale in the recent locust attacks in 11 districts.

Himangshu Gogoi, who quit the IAF to participate in the movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, filed the complaint at the Panbazar police station in Guwahati on Thursday.

Mr. Gogoi said in his FIR that on January 22, a person namely Durllov Nath uploaded a morphed photograph on Facebook showing his (Gogoi’s) face in the uniform of the Chief of Air Staff. This was done to defame him, he said.

He also named Rahul Das and Shruti Choudhury in his complaint for sharing the morphed photo to various groups and individuals. Their act, he said was “objectionable” and in “violation of the principles of the Air Force of the country”.

Such type of disregard towards the uniform may cause serious damage to the morale of the entire Air Force community as well as the other defence organisations of the country, Mr. Gogoi said.

‘Threat to dignity’

“Also, it may cause a serious threat to the dignity, security and sovereignty of the country,” the ex-IAF man said, seeking immediate arrest of the trio to “safeguard the dignity of the Indian Air Force” and steps to prevent the morphed photograph from being circulated.

260,2020/01/24,M.P. BJP minority cell workers quit over CAA,"“The NRC will spread nothing but anarchy,” said Waseem Khan, who has quit the Bharatiya Janata Party along with 66 others in Indore over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed nationwide implementation of the National Register of Citizenship.

“When they made triple talaq a punishable offence, we didn’t speak out. Then they diluted Article 370 of the Constitution, we didn’t speak out. Then came the Babri mosque verdict, and we thought it would be the end of the Hindu-Muslim divide,” said Mr. Khan, former BJP minority cell general secretary of Indore. “Then came the CAA, but now we must speak out.”

Quitting the party after 15 years, Mr. Khan, 42, said, “The BJP doesn’t care whether Muslims stay or leave it. Has it ever cared for minorities anyway?”

After managing to win the trust of Muslims over a series of contentious decisions taken by the BJP government at the Centre, he said, the CAA had turned the efforts futile. “What’s the point of staying in the party now when the community doesn’t want to support it at any cost due to the CAA?” he said.

Terming the party’s awareness drive across the country over the law a “complete failure”, he claimed securing support for the law, already passed in Parliament, through missed calls was a farce.

“The party is fooling people into giving them missed calls by promising free access to online streaming platforms if they did and by claiming certain lost phones will be found if the numbers were dialled,” he alleged.

When the law was passed last month, those who had resigned from the party now, had approached the local unit of the party flagging the divisive potential of the proposed nationwide NRC.

“Party general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya had assured us that the Muslims won’t be affected. But what about other leaders giving assurances in their areas?” said Mr. Khan.

Stating that the cell remained unaffected in Indore, its State vice-president Nasir Shah claimed, “Except for Mr. Khan, the rest were neither post-holders nor members of the party. I have been Indore district minority cell in-charge in the past and know each member. Well, some people want to show false numbers or cultivate an image for themselves.”

Javed Baig, the cell’s former State media chief, who quit the party over the law along with 47 others in Bhopal on January 11, said, “This will cost the BJP dear in the upcoming panchayat election in the State. It took years for the party to win the trust of Muslims in Madhya Pradesh.”

‘Suspected as informers’

“Earlier I was referred to as bhaisahab within the party, now party workers call me anti-national and a traitor. Dissenters say those who oppose the BJP are taken to be opposing the country’s interest. We are realising it now,” said Mr. Baig. “Besides, people within the community suspect us of being informers for the party, even though we have left it.”

While 165 members had quit the party in Khargone district, its State secretary Akram Khan had also put in his papers.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2frgid/article30646752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24-BHOPAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-bjp-minority-cell-workers-quit-over-caa/article30646753.ece
261,2020/01/24,Schools in Odisha’s Jajpur remain closed as elephant runs amok,"Hundreds of schools remained closed in Jajpur district of Odisha on Friday as an elephant trampled two persons to death.

The district administration on Thursday declared a holiday for primary and high schools in the Korei, Danagadi and Sukinda blocks, apprehending that the elephant could veer towards habitations.

Second attack

Ishwar Das of Godipatana and Chintamani Ram of Radhapatana died in an attack, three days after the elephant killed a person.

The Forest and Environment Department has constituted a team to track the elephant. “We have planned to tranquillise it,” Debendra Patnaik, a Forest Ranger of Jajpur Road, said.

The loss of human lives in elephant attacks in the State has crossed the 100-mark, for the first time, in the current year, between April and March.

102 deaths

According to Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO), which keeps a tab on the human-elephant conflict, 102 persons have died.

“Such a high number of human deaths has only pushed villagers to retaliate. This is contributing to the alarming number of unnatural deaths of elephants...,” WSO secretary Biswajit Mohanty said.

“It is high time the apex body for elephant conservation in India woke up to the alarming situation and took steps. Project Elephant should immediately constitute a committee of experts and conservationists to assess the situation, identify the reasons for human deaths and suggest short-term and long-term solutions,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/qdkbm1/article30646702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THODISHAELEPHANTFINAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/schools-in-odishas-jajpur-remain-closed-as-elephant-runs-amok/article30646704.ece
262,2020/01/24,Bengal CPI(M) wants RS seat for Yechury,"The West Bengal unit of the CPI (M) has renewed it's call to send party General Secretary Sitaram Yechury to Rajya Sabha in April this year when five members from the State will retire. The State unit had raised this demand in the recently concluded meeting of the Central Committee (CC), the highest executive body of the party, in Thiruvanathapuram.

“It’s immaterial who spoke at the CC meeting. What is important right now is that in the given context, someone like Sitaram Yechury can present the Left and the opposition's voice adequately at the national level that is the general feeling,” Sujan Chakraborty, legislative leader of CPI(M) in West Bengal told The Hindu.

Mr Chakraborty had raised the the issue during the CC meeting, though, according to sources, there was no further discussion on it. The CC meeting was held from January 17-19.

Mr. Yechury was in Rajya Sabha from 2005 to 2017. However, in 2017, the party refused to renominate him from West Bengal, though the Congress had offered the seat to the CPI(M). The party refused on the account that it has strict policy of not giving more than two consecutive terms in the Upper House. The party argued that as the General Secretary, Mr Yechury needed to concentrate on organisational work. Also at that time there was intense struggle within the party on it’s political stand with respect to the Congress.

Currently, the Left parties put together have 28 seats in the West Bengal Assembly. In April, five members from the State will retire. Four of these seats will go to the ruling Trinamool Congress. The opposition can make a bid for the fifth seat, which currently is held by Ritabrata Banerjee. Mr Banerjee was sent to upper house by CPI (M) but was expelled from the party in 2017. To send one member to the upper house any party needs support of 46 legislators. To send Mr Yechury, CPI (M) will again need support from the Congress.

“The political tactics can't be constant for next 20 years. The question we need to ask is who can represent the Left and the opposition in a best way,” Mr Chakraborty added. The West Bengal State secretariat will have to clear Mr Yechury’s appointment which ultimately has to be cleared by the Polit Bureau. If he is renominated this will be third term for Mr Yechury in Rajya Sabha.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/isnoa3/article30645109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-Yechury,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bengal-cpim-wants-rs-seat-for-yechury/article30645101.ece

Head of Department (Political Science), Shashi Shukla said the CAA was chosen as it was the “most discussed topic today” and was “connected with the Constitution and politics of India.""

Ms. Shukla said a proposal would be put before the university's Board of Studies for inclusion of the CAA in the syllabus. “If it is passed, it will go to the Faculty Board and then to the Academic Council, and after being passed by it, it [CAA] will be taught here.”

The topic of the debate, in which several colleges affiliated to the varsity would participate, would be “CAA is in the interest of India”, she said.

The university received a proposal from students that the CAA be included in the debate, she claimed. She praised the government for passing the law. The step must have been taken in “national interest”, she said.

Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati said including the “highly controversial and divisive” CAA in the LU syllabus was “fully wrong and improper” when the matter was in court. “The BSP strictly opposes this and if the party comes to power in UP, will withdraw it,” she tweeted.

Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav took a dig at the LU proposal, saying that if the current situation prevailed, soon the biography of “mukhiyaji” would be taught in the varsity. “And instead of the lectures, his sermons will be taught and his “chitrakatha” will be be included in the children's education,” he said.

Their “strange” eating habits aroused suspicion about their nationality, the BJP general secretary said at a seminar in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) here.

When a new room was being added at his house recently, he found “eating habits” of some of the workers “strange” as “they were eating only `poha’ (flattened rice)”, he said.

After talking to their supervisor and the building contractor, he suspected that these workers were from Bangladesh, the BJP leader said.

When reporters questioned him later, Mr. Vijayvargiya said, “I suspected these workers were residents of Bangladesh. Two days after I became suspicious, they stopped working at my house. I have not filed any police complaint yet. I only mentioned this incident to warn people,” he said.

Speaking at the seminar, Mr. Vijayvargiya also claimed that a Bangladeshi terrorist was keeping a watch on him for the last one and a half years.

“Whenever I go out, six armed security personnel follow me. What is happening in this country? Will outside people enter and spread so much terror?” he asked.

Members of the Sai Janmabhoomi Pathri Sansthan said they would file a petition in the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay High Court with evidence to prove that Sai Baba was born in Pathri.

A controversy has erupted over the purported birthplace of the revered saint, 102 years after he took ‘samadhi’ in Shirdi.

Some residents claimed that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had retracted his statement on Pathri being Sai Baba’s birthplace under pressure from the Shirdi temple trust.

MLC and president of the action committee, Babajani Durrani, said Pathri residents will move court on the issue.

“Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Jadhav had met Mr. Thackeray to seek his appointment for meeting Pathri residents but it was denied and we were told to not take the controversy any further,” said Mr. Durrani.

“We have decided to go for legal procedure to resolve this issue and won’t be meeting Mr. Thackeray. A team of advocates will visit Pathri and we will file a petition in the court next week,” he said.

“We won’t mind if the government grant for Pathri doesn’t come but we will never give up our claim that Pathri is the birthplace of Sai Baba,” he said.

The Sena on Tuesday said Mr. Thackeray should not be blamed for the “uncalled for” controversy over the birthplace of Sai Baba as nobody can tell whether the 19th Century saint was actually born in Shirdi.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sai-baba-birthplace-row-pathri-residents-to-move-court/article30640292.ece

The ruling Congress has issued a whip asking its MLAs to attend the session on the first two days.

The session will commence with the customary address of Governor Kalraj Mishra. The resolution is likely to be tabled and passed in the House on the second day of the session, which will be extended after a gap for the presentation of the State Budget next month.

The Kerala and Punjab Assemblies have passed similar resolutions to build pressure on the Union government over the contentious citizenship law. Mr. Pilot, who is also the Pradesh Congress Committee president, said the State Assembly would request the Union government to reconsider the statute and withdraw it at the earliest.

Mr. Pilot reviewed the preparations for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's ‘Yuva Aakrosh Rally’ in Jaipur on January 28 at a meeting held at the PCC headquarters here. He said Mr. Gandhi would raise “real issues” concerning the people and focus on the fear and unrest among the youth, who were facing unemployment as well as the challenges of an economic recession.

“The BJP government at the Centre should listen to the people protesting against the CAA across the country. There is no dialogue with them... They are being attacked and called anti-nationals,” Mr. Pilot said, adding that peaceful protest was a constitutional right of citizens.

The Department of Environment and Climate Change has decided to ensure replacement of more than 15 -year-old three-wheelers with electric, CNG vehicles, said K.S. Pannu, Director, ‘Tandrust Punjab Mission’, on Wednesday.

“It has been observed that a large number of three wheelers which are more than 15 years are operating in Punjab but as per 68C of the Punjab Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, three wheeler autorickshaws cannot operate beyond 15 years,” said Mr. Pannu.

Registration banned

The Punjab Pollution Control Board has already banned the registration of new diesel/petrol-operated three-wheelers in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and Mohali districts since January 2019. Also, the case for banning such vehicles in the districts of Patiala and Bathinda is under the consideration of the Board and CNG supply stations have recently been set up in these two districts to meet the demand.

“Deputy Commissioners of all major cities have been asked to undertake measures to weed out the old three-wheelers and to provide opportunity to owners of having gas-electric-based three-wheelers,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-govt-to-ban-15-year-old-autorickshaws/article30628219.ece
275,2020/01/24,"Journalist detained in Aligarh, called “terrorist”","Aligarh Police detained a young video journalist who was covering the protest against the Citizen (Amendment) Act in the Shahjamal area of the city on Thursday.

Shaheen Abdullah is a student of mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia and works with Maktoob Media. He was released after around four hours. “When I was covering the protest, some policemen asked me to come with them to the police station. I showed them my Press card, but they didn’t acknowledge it and repeatedly called me an antankavadi [terrorist].”

At the police station, Mr. Abdullah told The Hindu, they took away his diary, laptop, and phone. “When I told them I was from Jamia, they described it as atankavadiyon ki university (university of terrorists) and asked me why I was humiliating the police through my work.”

Later, he said, some senior officers came and tried to play the “good cop.” “They said they were just verifying my credentials. When I said, it could have been done at the protest site, they digressed and kept delaying my release.” He said his SD card, which has some crucial recording, was still with the police. “They have promised to return it later in the night.”

Mr. Abdullah is the same journalist who was beaten by the Delhi Police near Jamia Milia Islamia and was saved by some girls. “Now I have experienced both the Delhi and the Uttar Pradesh Police. There is not much of a difference.”

Abhishek, Superintendent of Police, Aligarh said Mr. Abdullha was taken into preventive detention for indulging in suspicious activity. “He was present at the protest site with some outsiders. As there were chances at that time of the protest turning violent, he along with three other people were taken into preventive detention.”

Mr. Abhishek said the permission for the protest was only for Tuesday and Wednesday. “But when the women turned up on Thursday as well with some men, police tried to stop them. They wanted to take out a march in the city. During this process, the presence of outsiders, including one from Kerala, was seen as suspicious. We wanted to ask him how he got the information of a random protest beforehand.”

Mr Abdullah is a Malayali and is not conversant in Hindi.

Locals alleged that the police tried to use his detention as a tactic to end the protest. Maryam Akeel, a young girl who went to the Delhi Gate police station to see Mr. Abdullah, said she and her friends were told that they should give up their protest if they wanted him to be released. “We were asked to submit our address and phone number. We are scared. Can’t we peacefully protest in this country,” she asked. “We are here to save the Constitution.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/journalist-detained-in-aligarh-called-terrorist/article30638350.ece
276,2020/01/24,"Collecting toll on Pune-Satara highway illegal, say activists","With citizens, lawyers and even politicians joining the clamour for the closure of Khed-Shivapur toll plaza on the long-pending Pune-Satara national highway, a Thane-based lawyer-activist Praveen Wategaonkar, along with Sanjay Shirodkar, a Pune-based activist, have filed a complaint with the CBI against P.S. Toll Road Private Ltd — a special purpose vehicle promoted by Reliance Infrastructure.

The complainants have alleged that while the Pune-Satara highway, work on which commenced in 2010, is nowhere near completion, P.S. Toll Road has illegally collected toll revenue of nearly ₹1780 crore in the past nine years.

In their complaint filed on Wednesday, Mr. Wategaonkar and Mr. Shirodkar have also named the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) along with other entities.

“We have lodged a complaint under Sections 405, 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant or banker), 420 (cheating) to be read with sections 34, 120(B) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Prevention of Corruption Act,” said Mr. Wategaonkar, and added that their 100-page complaint was based on a careful study of bid documents, CAG reports and other documents obtained under Right To Information (RTI) Act.

He said as per their contract, P.S. Toll Road was to complete the six-lane development of the 140 km Pune-Satara highway within 30 months beginning October 2010.

“The six-laning of the highway was to have finished by March 31, 2013. Yet, it has dragged on for nine years,” said Mr. Wategaonkar.

The complaint says that on December 16, 2013, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways issued amended rules pertaining to the levy of toll on national highways which prohibited collection of toll where six-laning process had been delayed beyond scheduled completion dates.

“P.S. Toll Road had no authority to collect toll since 2014 without completing the six-laning process. So, the extensions granted by the NHAI to the construction schedule are in violation of bidding terms,” Mr. Wategaonkar said.

The abysmal condition of the Pune-Satara road with its incomplete bridges, pot holes and congestion points have left users harried, often doubling their commute time.

An online petition which began late last year has had little, if any, effect on the NHAI.

Political parties like the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), with its agitation against illicit toll collection, too have stepped into the fray while Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Supriya Sule has demanded action. Earlier this month, the Pune District Collector had written to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), urging the stoppage of toll collection at the Khed-Sivapur toll plaza.

RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar said that this particular toll plaza on the Pune-Satara highway stretch was a classic case of holding passengers ‘captive’ by deliberately delaying completion of the project.

“This [Pune-Satara toll] case is a peculiarity in Maharashtra where toll is being collected despite the non-completion of a service road. Given the amount of money involved, any immediate crackdown on this staggering corruption appears unlikely,” Mr. Kumbhar said.

Activist Vivek Velankar of the Sajag Nagrik Manch alleged that the NHAI had no control whatsoever over road contractors, resulting in commuters being the ultimate sufferers.

“It appears that the incomplete Pune-Satara highway stretch is being funded by the illicit funds garnered by levying toll from hapless travellers. Why else has the six-laning been delayed by nearly seven years when it ought to have been completed by 2013?” Mr. Velankar asked.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1tia6q/article30638181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BM-Pune-Satara-Toll-Naka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/collecting-toll-on-pune-satara-highway-illegal-say-activists/article30638182.ece
277,2020/01/24,Maratha outfits object to new MNS flag with Shivaji’s seal,"Several Maratha outfits, including the Sambhaji Brigade, have objected to the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena’s newly minted flag incorporating Chhatrapati Shivaji’s royal seal or ‘Rajmudra’, with the Brigade approaching the Pune police on Thursday demanding that an FIR be lodged against MNS chief Raj Thackeray and his party for using the Maratha King’s seal for ‘crass’ political purposes.

The Brigade leaders submitted a written application to the police urging a probe and an FIR against the ‘misuse’ of the seal.

Lashing out at Mr. Thackeray, the Brigade said it would also approach the State Election Commission to lodge a complaint against the MNS.

“Chhatrapati Shivaji’s Rajmudra [royal seal] was created by the king for the welfare of the people. Its purpose was to ensure a fair and just administration, and it lent a great weight to Shivaji’s decisions owing to his ideals of Swarajya. It is a symbol of great import and significance to the admirers and followers of the Chhatrapati. But it is highly inappropriate for any party to use the seal for petty political purposes,” said Santosh Shinde, district president, Sambhaji Brigade.

He said the Brigade would also approach the Chhatrapati’s direct descendants including ex-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)-turned BJP leader Udayanraje Bhosale and urge them to pursue the case vigorously.

The famous first lines of the seal say, “Ever growing in splendour like the moon on the first day of the bright half of the month, and adored by the world, this seal of Shivaji, the son of Shahaji, shines for the welfare of all.”

Saying the Brigade strongly condemned the intentions of the MNS, Mr. Shinde said Mr. Thackeray’s party, which had thus based its politics on regional chauvinism and social divisiveness, had no moral authority to use the seal.

“The MNS keeps changing its colours like a chameleon. When it failed to secure any votes on its earlier flag, it has now taken recourse to a new stratagem by incorporating Shivaji’s seal for seeking votes…we strongly condemn Mr. Thackeray and his party and we will keep opposing them.”

While his party did not contest, Mr. Thackeray’s spirited campaigning for the Congress and the NCP in the general election last year had come a cropper, with the BJP-Sena candidates winning with huge margins in the very constituencies the MNS chief had held rallies.

In the Assembly polls held in October, Mr. Thackeray entered the poll arena and contested in 100 seats, winning only one (Kalyan Rural).",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/scj06a/article30638159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMRAJTHACKERAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maratha-outfits-object-to-new-mns-flag-with-shivajis-seal/article30638161.ece
278,2020/01/24,Support Centre in bid to throw out illegal immigrants: Raj Thackeray,"From changing the colour of his 12-year old party flag to saffron, embossed with Rajmudra (royal seal used by Chhatrapati Shivaji), and launching his son Amit in active politics from a stage displaying Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar’s photo, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Thursday jumped on the bandwagon of Hindutva politics by extending support to Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens, by claiming these steps are to throw out illegal Muslim immigrants.

Declaring that he was never opposed the BJP for the sake of opposing, the MNS chief said that he supported decisions on Article 370, and Ram temple and will support the government on the issue of throwing illegal immigrants out.

Mr. Thackeray announced a protest march against illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh on February 9, and said this was in retaliation to the anti-CAA march across the country.

“Suddenly there are number of protests across the country with thousands of Muslims hitting the streets. Some people told me they are angry over removal of Article 370 and Ram temple verdict of the court and are now venting out their anger. How many of those Muslims were Indian? How many were from outside? Why should we support you if you are supporting Muslims from outside?” asked Mr. Thackeray addressing the first-ever MNS plenary meeting in Goregaon.

“There can be a debate on the Citizenship Amendment Act but why should we shelter someone who has come to India illegally from outside,” he said, adding that he has been saying the same for years. “Just because the colour of the flag is changed, people are saying that I have changed. No. I am what I was before,” he added.

Taunting Shiv Sena which has allied with Congress and NCP, Mr. Thackeray said he does not change colour to join the government.

Mr. Thackeray said that changing the flag is nothing new and he has not diverted from his position. “If Marathi population is facing injustice I will pounce on them for Marathi and if Hindu is being targeted I will attack like a Hindu,” he said.

Before unveiling his party’s new saffron flag, the MNS chief paid tributes to his uncle and Shiv Sena founder late Bal Thackeray on the latter’s 94th birth anniversary. The MNS was set up in 2006 after Raj Thackeray split from the Shiv Sena and had decided to adopt the tricoloured saffron, blue and green flag.

He also paid respects to V.D. Savarkar besides Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, B.R. Ambedkar and his grandfather Prabhodhankar Thackeray.

‘Proudest moment’

One of the key highlights of the party program was the launch of Raj Thackeray’s son Amit into active politics. “This is one of the proudest moment for me. I was told at the last moment by my father that it was today that I have to join active politics. I am thrilled but at the same time I understand the responsibility bestowed upon me,” said Amit.

Amit’s entry into politics is also being compared to that of his cousin and State Tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray. The MNS hopes that Amit Thackeray will help attract young voters.

New political combinations are likely to emerge after Mr. Thackeray’s speech on Thursday as both MNS and BJP are left with no allies in the State. Recently, former chief minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis held a meeting with Mr. Thackeray giving rise to speculation on both parties joining hands.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/d55oo4/article30638111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMAMITTHACKERAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/support-centre-in-bid-to-throw-out-illegal-immigrants-raj-thackeray/article30638112.ece
279,2020/01/24,Nallasopara arms haul: one more held from Kolkata,"The Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad has arrested one person wanted in connection with the 2018 Nallasopara arms haul. The accused, who was held in West Bengal, is also alleged to be part of the group that had planned to target the Sunburn 2017 festival in Pune.

The ATS had in 2018 seized a large amount of guns, ammunition and other arsenal, including crude bombs, from members of right wing groups like the Sanatan Sanstha in multiple raids, which began with Nallasopara in the Thane district and expanded to Solapur, Satara and Sangli. The agency arrested 12 people in August 2018 and filed a charge sheet in December 2018.

ATS officers said Judhishtar Hajra (34), arrested on Wednesday, was on the run after the raids began in 2018.

“We were on the lookout for him after his name cropped up in the interrogation of the other accused. Earlier this month, we received a tip-off saying he was hiding in his native West Bengal. We sent a team to verify the information and on Wednesday picked him up in Kolkata with the help of the local police,” an ATS officer said.

The officer said he has been brought to Mumbai and produced before a local court which remanded him in police custody till January 30.

The ATS has already arrested and chargesheeted Sharad Kalaskar (25), Vaibhav Raut (44), Sudhanwa Gondhlekar (39), Shrikant Pangarkar (40), Avinash Pawar (30), Leeladhar Ukhirde (32), Vasudeo Suryawanshi (19), Suchit Rangswamy (37), Bharat Kurne (37), Amol Kale (34), Amit Baddi (27) and Ganesh Miskin (28) in the case, charging them under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

The ATS had, in August, seized 23 live country-made bombs, 15 pistols, a country-made gun, a partially completed country-made weapon, three pistols without barrels, ten pistol barrels, six pistol magazines, three partially made pistol magazines, seven pistol slides, 41 live rounds of ammunition, 26 electric and non-electric detonators and other raw-material used for making more guns and bombs.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/u8iy1k/article30638044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMNALLASOPARAARMSHAUL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nallasopara-arms-haul-one-more-held-from-kolkata/article30638045.ece
280,2020/01/24,Hindu man’s liver gives life to Muslim woman,"Setting an example of religious harmony and humanity, a Hindu family in Kolkata donated the liver of a member who passed away on Tuesday to a Muslim woman suffering from end-stage liver cirrhosis.

Doctors at the School of Digestive and Liver Diseases ( SDLD) of SSKM Hospital in Kolkata successfully conducted a liver transplant on Sahana Khatun (29).

Though it was seventh liver transplant performed by SDLD doctors since January 2019, what made the procedure unique was that the donor, Kalyan Kumar Roychowdhury (67), was a Hindu and the recipient, Ms. Khatun, a Muslim.

Speaking to The Hindu about the transplant, Dr. Abhijit Chowdhury, who heads the SDLD, said that it was only a coincidence that the donor and the recipient were from different religions.

“What matters for a transplant is that the blood group and other parameters should match. The patient on whom the transplant is to be carried out is selected on the basis of a priority list. Till a few hours ago, we were not aware that the donor and the recipient were from different religions,” Dr. Chowdhury said.

The doctor added that it was only after interest was shown by media that they realised that the transplant presented a “classic case of religious harmony”.

“In the present times, this is possibly one of the examples of communal harmony and it proves that all human beings are the same,” Dr. Chowdhury said.

‘Won’t hesitate’

S.K. Shabbir Ali, the brother of Ms. Khatun, said they had been waiting for a donor for quite some time. “In my life if I get an opportunity I will not hesitate to donate my organs to a person from a different religion,” said Mr. Ali said.

The family members of Roychowdhury, a resident of Bally in Howrah district who met with an accident on Monday and was declared brain dead on Tuesday, said they are very happy that his organs has saved lives.

“My mother said that if my father had faced such a situation, he would have taken the same decision of donating the organs,” said Adrita Roychowdhury, the daughter of deceased.

Protesters, mostly women and girls, can be seen waving national flag, singing patriotic songs and reciting poems at dharnas in parks and open areas. In Patna alone, such protests are being held at three places for the past several days.

‘No party flags’

Politicians and social activists like Brinda Karat, Kanhaiya Kumar, Yogendra Yadav, Tejashwi Yadav and Shivanand Tiwari have addressed the protesters, explaining the implications of the CAA. “We don’t allow them to make political speeches here. They come to lend us support, nothing more,” said Omair Khan, who has been leading one such protest at Gaya’s Shanti Bagh.

“Leaders are welcome to lend us support, but no party flags are allowed,” said Mohd. Sarfaraj, who has been sitting on protest at Patna’s Subzibagh.

Addressing a rally in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 in Meerut on Wednesday with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the Union Minister for Animal Husbandry, Dairy, and Fisheries said he would “urge Rajnathji to make provision for a reservation to students of western Uttar Pradesh in these Delhi universities to treat those raising anti-national slogans”. “Sabka ilaj kar denge, kisi ki zaroorat nahin padne ki” (they will treat everybody, nobody else would be required),” he said.

‘Anti-national slogans’

He pointed out thousands of students were supporting the CAA in Meerut and Muzaffarnagar but only the protests of students of the Jamia and the JNU which have around eight to ten thousands were making news for raising anti-national slogans.

Earlier, Mr Singh tried to allay fears of Muslims about the CAA. “Let me assure my Muslim brothers that those who are citizens of India would not be touched,” he said, adding even Mahatma Gandhi wanted citizenship for persecuted minorities.

“Unfortunately, present-day India is totally different from what he had envisaged. We fight in the name of religion and caste. Through the presentation, which has freestyle choreography, we want to tell the people that we should be ashamed of failing him and that we should hope and work for an India of his dreams,” says Girija.

Neethu VM, an up-and-coming poet, has also written the lyrics of this choreography composed by Mathew T Itty. Sixty-five dancers from the institution are part of this production.

Eighty dancers pay homage to revolutionary poet and nationalist Subramania Bharathi in the second production, ‘Bharathiyar’. “We have taken lines from his poem, ‘Bharata samudayam vazhgave’, that extols the virtues of our country and inspires us to take pride in our culture and heritage. His verses instil patriotism, which is the need of the hour,” Girija adds. They will also dance to his famous poem, ‘Odi vilayadu pappa’, in which he addresses children. “He gave us a strong message against discriminating people on the basis of caste and religion,” Girija points out.

Sanskrit verses are also included in this presentation, which is 30 minutes long. “The lines remind us about our age-old practices and tradition and how we are expected to respect Nature, the earth and water,” she says. Abhiram Jayachandran is the composer.

286,2020/01/24,Sita Parityagam: Dance and Divinity,"The atmosphere was just right. The backdrop was a centuries’ old temple, the women looked ethereal in their fetching silks and the performer was a flag-bearer of a 2000-year-old performing art. Under the aegis of Gudi Sambaralu, renowned artist Kapila Venu performed excerpts from Sita Parityagam at the majestic precincts of the Sitaram Bagh temple in the old city and had the audience hooked to the tempo and tapestry of her art.

Friends Shashi Reddy and Srinagi Rao started Gudi Sambaralu in 2015 with the idea of trying to revive traditional art forms with the temple as its axis. Starting from the temples in and around Hyderabad, Gudi Sambaralu has spread its wings across the remote temples of Telangana and moved on to capture the audiences in and across Andhra Pradesh this year.

This has helped to rediscover and shed light on many forgotten performing art forms indigenous to local communities. The programs are conducted in courtyards, kalyanamandapas and stepwells of the temples. The event was conducted in the premises of the Sitaram Bagh Temple. The temple built by Puranmal Ganeriwala, a banker, in 1832 is a fine blend of different architectural styles including South Indian, Rajasthani, Mughal and European. The shrine is noted for its imposing gateways, in three directions – east, west and south. The main gateway is located on the Mallepally. The beautiful airy courtyards spread over 25 acres. With its intricately painted doors, quaint courtyards and an air of majesty, it effortlessly transports visitors into a bygone era.

The performance which lasted for an hour and half, moved the diverse audience (from children to grandparents) to empathise with the pain of pregnant Sita when she learns of Rama’s abandonment of her and her final journey when she returns to her mother. Both with her bhava and abhinaya, as well as her command over the art form, Kapila proved just why she is one of the most sought after artists of today. With no words, she explained the story only through her masterful expressions and body language.

Koodiyattam, recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity is different from other Indian dance forms as it relies heavily on the audience interpreting the story being told. Koodiyattam performances were originally restricted only to temples and took upto 40 days to finish a sequence of storytelling.

Kapila stresses on this when asked if she feels the legacy of the ancient art form on her shoulder each time she comes out to perform.

“More than its legacy, I always feel responsible as it’s not an easy art form to follow.” she candidly answers, “Because it compels people to delve inside to understand, they have difficulties following the performance and some don’t have the patience. So the real challenge is to transcend all these factors.”

Performing a piece from Kalidasa’s Raghuvamsa, the acclaimed artist says, “I chose this particular piece as this is a Sita Rama temple and I felt that it was apt. It is an emotional piece and showcases the pain of Sita, at her most vulnerable.”

Kapila, who is performing in the city only for the second time says, “It’s a great feeling to perform in temples as they have a great energy and temple spaces need to be used to connect people. It’s also amazing to see women leading this effort.”",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/4t9vnu/article30642297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf24gudisambaralu,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/sita-parityagam-dance-and-divinity-the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30642298.ece
287,2020/01/24,NZ vs IND: KL Rahul relishing the dual role,"Keeping wickets and batting up front is a lot more work, but India’s K.L. Rahul on Friday said he “is loving” the additional responsibility as it is bringing the best out of him. Rahul scored 56 off 27 balls, his 99-run partnership with Virat Kohli setting up India’s chase.

Rahul kept wickets full-time first during the three-match ODI series against Australia last week. Following his good work with the bat and behind the stumps, Kohli had said he would continue in his dual role “for a while” as it lent balance to the team.

Loving it

“I’m, quite honestly, loving it. On the international stage, it might seem very new and it might seem like I’ve never kept. (But) I’ve kept for my IPL franchise for the last three to four years, and I’ve kept for my First Class team. I’ve still stayed in touch with wicketkeeping.

“I enjoy staying behind the stumps and it also gives me a great idea about how the pitch is playing, and I can pass on that message to the bowlers and the captains with field-sets and everything. As a ’keeper, that’s also your responsibility to stay active and pass the message on to your captain as to what lengths are better and what I feel we can do better.”

Talking about Shreyas Iyer’s unbeaten 58 off 29 balls, Rahul said his execution was perfect.

“It was a fantastic finish. We have seen for a while that in crunch situations we have lacked someone who can to take the team through. But Shreyas, Shivam (Dube) and even Manish (Pandey) started striking the ball from the moment they went in. When you’re chasing over 200, you need a boundary in every over. The execution was very impressive today.”

Experience

The winning start would add to their adaptation and experience for the matches ahead, he said. “As a bowling unit, we have a fair idea of what lines and lengths we have to bowl. Change of pace will be very important. As a batting unit, the dimensions and shape of the ground will be a key point,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/33lvy2/article30646909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25RAHUL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-first-t20-international-in-auckland/article30646910.ece
288,2020/01/24,I’ve had phenomenal teammates: Vernon Philander,"When Vernon Philander was called up to South Africa’s Test squad in 2011, his selection was met with dismay in the light of his disappointing stint in the limited-overs sides in 2007 and 2008. However, Philander proved his detractors wrong, reaching 50 wickets in seven Tests — the best since 1896.

As Philander prepares to walk into the sunset after the fourth Test against England, he recalls his debut match against Australia, the value Jacques Kallis and Mark Boucher bring as mentors and more in an email interview.

Talk us through your Test debut, against Australia in 2011

I was just honored to be receiving my Test cap. You find yourself up against a formidable Australian side that would have played very good cricket over a day and a half. I got to bowl midday on day three and I still remember we had our backs against the wall after being bowled out for 90 odd (96 all out)... Dale and I laughed at each other and said ‘we have to bowl them out for a 100 to stand a chance’.

Little did we know we will bowl them out for 47. It was one of those fairytale Test matches that you always talk about when you are done with the game.There have been lots of highs and lows since but that’s why you play the sport. The game’s going to break you at some stage but you got to be mentally strong to make those comebacks. I’ve had phenomenal teammates and captains. You need those kinds of people around to make it worthwhile to play for as long as I have.

What value do Boucher and Kallis bring to the table as members of the coaching staff?

Both have been around for a long time. The first thing (they bring to the table) is the mindset of being calm... Putting in the hard yards to make sure you are ready for what it takes to succeed at this level.

Can you recall any dismissal that stands out in your mind?

I always like the ones where you set up the batter. I remember running into (Virat) Kohli at Cape Town in 2018 (1st Test, second innings) where I bowled across to him for two overs and then trapped him in front with the one coming back in.

289,2020/01/24,"NZ vs IND first T20I: A win like this sets up the whole tour for us, says Kohli","India also beat the jet lag besides New Zealand in the T20 series opener here and skipper Virat Kohli said Friday’s convincing win was just the kind of start his team was looking for.

India, who arrived only a couple of days ago, chased down New Zealand’s 203 for five with an over to spare.

Kohli had spoken about the tight scheduling in the pre-match press conference but there was no such talk within the team.

“We enjoyed this. Landing two days before and playing a game like this, it was fantastic... This sets up for the whole tour for us. Felt like 80 percent support was for us and the crowd was right behind us. You need that sort of push chasing 200 plus. We never spoke of the jet lag in the team. We didn’t want any excuse,” said Kohli at the post-match presentation.

New Zealand is a good seven and a half hours ahead of India time.

India came into the series high on confidence, having beaten Australia 2-1 at home in the ODI series that concluded on Sunday.

“We had a really good series against Australia and we took that confidence in here. You can’t be harsh on anyone on this kind of pitch. I think we did well in the middle overs, to restrict them under 210 was a good effort.

“I think fielding is one thing that we can improve on, just getting used to the ground dimensions and the ball snaking a bit,” said Kohli, referring to the longer side boundaries and short straight boundaries at the peculiar shaped Eden Park.

Shreyas Iyer (58 not out off 29) finished the game for India after K L Rahul (56off 27) and Kohli (45 off 32) provided the launch pad.

New Zealand captain Kane Williamson said defending 203 was always going to be tough at this venue.

“We know coming to Eden Park it’s hard to defend and there was a bit of dew and obviously India showed their class. We knew batting first we had to get a good total on the board.

“Being a second-used surface, it was a high scoring game. But with ball in hand, if we could get three or four early, we could have got ahead of the game.”

Williamson himself blazed away to a 26-ball 51.

“Taking pace off seemed to be working okay, but it was tough to execute because India put us under pressure constantly. But we do need to find ways to pick up some wickets.

“It was nice to build some partnerships. Guys came in and played their roles really well. It’s important we improve in all areas in the next game,” said Williamson.

We didn’t put enough pressure on Indian batsmen: Ross Taylor

New Zealand’s Ross Taylor lamented that their bowlers didn’t put enough pressure on the Indian batsmen in the first T20 International, held at a ground with odd dimensions.

Shreyas Iyer’s second T20 half-century powered the visitors to a six-wicket win, completing a stiff chase of 204 with an over to spare.

Taylor said that the hosts were probably 10-15 runs short on a batting beauty at Eden Park, but failed with extras and lack of pressure on the Indian middle order.

“It is hard to tell at Eden Park. In the last three overs India bowled well and we didn’t get a big over. We still did get 100 in the last 10 overs to put pressure on them but it’s always hard to gauge,” Taylor said.

“We bowled well but sometimes have to give credit to how batsmen are. In T20s you have to learn quick and we have to adapt. Our bowlers will have to look at them and at the same time their batsmen are a class line-up all the way through.

“The way we attack them in the next game will be crucial. How we attack them and how we do that on Sunday.”

Colin Munro and Kane Williamson scored attacking half centuries before Taylor made his first T20I half-century in six years to propel New Zealand to 203 for five.

The batsman appreciated the base set earlier but said the middle order didn’t generate enough momentum in the last few overs.

“A lot of times when you play at Eden Park wind is a factor and you are able to attack from both ends. It was hard to know what a good total is. They won with an over to spare so we were definitely 10-15 runs short.”

“What they did better was we lost couple of wickets in crucial stages and the new batsmen were not able to get the momentum or rotate strike.

“In India’s batting, we were not able to get those quick dots and get the rate up to put them under pressure at 10-11 (per over). We were stuck at nine and a half for a long time (and couldn’t restrict them) and on Eden Park batsmen always feel comfortable,” he said.

Taylor also spoke about the difference Jasprit Bumrah’s experience made in the death overs.

“He has been a class bowler for a long time and one of the best death bowlers going around. He has a potent slow ball, and that extra pace, so you have to adapt to both the slower and quicker ball.

“He showed us what to expect and we need to learn quickly and play their bowlers slightly better,” he said.

The Eden Park wicket and ground came under scrutiny as bowlers from both sides suffered in the first T20.

Taylor said that the ground’s dimensions adds an unpredictable factor to the game and added that both teams must adapt before Sunday’s second game here.

“You just cannot be predictable with both bat and ball, and am not sure, what our extras count is. You can either bowl too short or too full we know that the short boundaries are very short so you cannot be predictable.

“On a good wicket you can clear the boundaries with ease. Eden Park definitely adds a new dimension and what we have learnt is that in two games in a row it slows up a little bit.

“We just have to wait and see, and adapt, if there will be any dew. Eden Park is not the easiest ground to field with such low lights.”

Taylor praised the way India went about their task.

“They ran between the wickets fantastically well and sometimes touring teams can take a little time to get used to things here. But the way they played, last year they learnt playing on these grounds and adapted a lot quicker than they did last year,” he said.

Iyer and Manish Pandey came together after the dismissal of both K L Rahul and Virat Kohli, but were able to resist the pressure situation.

Taylor said their bowlers needed to learn and adapt better as Iyer showed what he is capable of doing in the middle despite his relative inexperience.

“He (Iyer) is not very experienced in international cricket, but in a pressure situation made it look easy with some of those boundaries. If he had got out, then a new batsman coming in and couple of dots would have made the run rate up,” Taylor signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/7bx9j5/article30644485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRATKOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/new-zealand-vs-india-first-t20-international-in-auckland-virat-kohlis-press-conference/article30644486.ece
290,2020/01/24,"NZ vs IND first T20I: Shreyas, Rahul give India thumping win over New Zealand","The immensely talented Shreyas Iyer enhanced his reputation as a finisher with a scintillating 29-ball-58 in India’s six-wicket victory over New Zealand in a high-scoring first T20 International here on Friday.

Iyer built on KL Rahul’s (56 off 27 balls) blazing start and Virat Kohli’s useful 45 off 32 balls as India made short work of a 204-run target, knocking it off with an over to spare.

Credit should be given to Indian bowlers for restricting New Zealand towards the end considering the dimensions of the Eden Park.

Earlier, Colin Munro and Kane Williamson had smashed quick-fire half-centuries as New Zealand scored 203-5.

In pursuit of 204, India lost Rohit Sharma (7) early in the second over as he played one too many shots in a bid to go after spinner Mitchell Santner (1-50).

Rahul and Kohli then took charge of the innings with an 80-run partnership coming off only 47 balls. The duo launched a good array of strokes with seven fours and four sixes between them as New Zealand struggled to contain the runs.

India crossed 100 in the ninth over thanks to their whirlwind partnership, albeit both had chances. Rahul survived a mix-up as New Zealand failed to hit the stumps twice, and then Ish Sodhi dropped a sitter off Kohli.

Continuing his fine form, Rahul notched up his half-century off 23 balls while Kohli fell short of his landmark by just five runs. Together, they provided the base for India’s middle order to finish the chase.

The Black Caps roared back into contention with a double blow. First, Rahul was out caught off Sodhi in the 10th over and then seven balls later, Martin Guptill pulled off a screamer at deep mid wicket to send back Kohli.

India lost their set batsmen for six runs and their ploy to send Shivam Dube (13) up the order only had limited success. Dube and Iyer added 21 runs to provide some acceleration, before the all-rounder was Sodhi’s second dismissal of the night.

Iyer then took charge of proceedings as he smacked five fours and three sixes to propel India to victory. He added 50 off 29 balls with Manish Pandey, who hit 14 not out off 12 balls with a six.

It was an immaculate display by the young batsman who showed the benefits of reaping experience batting in the middle order and perhaps answering India’s questions regarding the number four situation.

This was after Munro, Williamson and Ross Taylor (54 not out off 27 balls) made the Indian bowlers suffer. Jasprit Bumrah (1-31) put in a good shift with clever change of pace and control.

Also Yuzvendra Chahal (1/32 in 4 overs) and Ravindra Jadeja (1/18 in 2 overs) kept a check on the run-flow during the back-end.

Munro scored 59 off 42 balls, including six fours and two sixes, while Williamson hit four fours and four sixes in his 26-ball 51-run innings as the Black Caps’ made good use of the peculiar Eden Park shape to pile on the runs.

New Zealand quickly got off the blocks with openers Munro and Martin Guptill (30 off 19 balls) putting on 68-0 in the power play. It was the highest power play score for New Zealand against India in T20Is (previous best 66-0 in 2019).

Shardul Thakur (1-44) and Mohammed Shami (0-53) proved to be expensive in their opening spells. India were forced to use as many six bowlers in the first eight overs.

Dube (1-24) got the breakthrough with Rohit Sharma catching smartly to dismiss Guptill. It brought Williamson to the crease and the onslaught continued as he put on 36 off 24 balls with Munro.

The latter reached his half-century off 36 balls before holing out off Thakur. India quickly got a second wicket in the space of four balls with Ravindra Jadeja (1-18) dismissing Colin de Grandhomme (0).

New Zealand, at 117-3 in the 13th over, were placed awkwardly but Williamson and Taylor put on 61 off 28 balls to completely decimate the Indian bowling in the second half of their innings.

Taylor smashed three fours and three sixes, taking 22 runs off Shami in the 16th over, as he raced to a 25-ball half-century. It was his first T20I half-century in six years. Williamson too completed his half-century off 25 balls.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/w8hl1s/article30644431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IYER-PANDEY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-first-t20-international-in-auckland/article30644432.ece
291,2020/01/24,Selection panels: Agarkar and Prasad join the fray,"A quartet of former India pacers — the most prominent being World T20 winner Ajit Agarkar and Venkatsh Prasad — submitted their applications for the national selectors’ post hours before the window closed at midnight on Friday.

Agarkar, Venkatesh Prasad, Chetan Sharma and Abey Kuruvilla entering the fray has made the process of appointing replacements for M.S.K. Prasad and Devang Gandhi even more interesting. At the moment, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is yet to appoint the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC). Once the CAC is in place, it will have to consider some of the high-profile entrants on the last day.

Agarkar and Prasad both have played a lot of cricket with and under Sourav Ganguly, who has now been elevated as the BCCI chief. It remains to be seen whether proximity to Ganguly ends up helping the duo or works against them. Agarkar confirmed to The Hindu for having “submitted” his application on Friday, a BCCI official stressed Prasad “has applied” despite the 50-year-old preferring to be non-committal.

While Prasad has served three years as a national junior selector, Agarkar’s two-year stint as the chairman of Mumbai’s selection committee was far from smooth sailing. Prasad has also served as the bowling coach of the national team towards the end of the last decade but in the last three years, has lost out in the race of high-profile posts including bowling coach, general manager - cricket operations and the team manager. Agarkar, meanwhile, is renowned for his cricketing acumen and ability to communicate with cricketers in no uncertain terms.

Besides the duo, Kuruvilla and Sharma have also entered the fray. While Kuruvilla was the chief of junior selection committee for the 2012 Under-19 World Cup-winning squad, Sharma has been serving as a commentator of late.

Prasad and Agarkar will thus join L. Sivaramakrishnan as the top three contenders for the two vacant posts, should the BCCI decide to deviate from the convention of including a selector from each of the five zones. But if the BCCI decides to stick to the tradition, Prasad and Sivaramakrishnan will vie for one slot, while the likes of Agarkar, Kuruvilla and Sharma will drop out of the race.

The three existing members of the selection committee are Sarandeep Singh (north zone), Devang Gandhi (east zone) and Jatin Paranjape (west zone).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/rak6yc/article30644360.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AJITAGARKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ajit-agarkar-applies-for-national-selectors-job/article30644362.ece
292,2020/01/24,"India’s dependency on Kohli has lessened, says Ravi Shastri","Acknowledging that his job is to “finetune” the players, India coach Ravi Shastri also stressed that the support staff played a huge part in the team’s success.

“We all have roles. Our job is to finetune them (players) in every possible way because when you're on the road, there could be little things that creep into your game. If you don’t realise, it could lead to bigger things,” Shastri told The Hindu prior to the team’s departure to New Zealand.

Was the team not too dependent on Virat Kohli as a batsman, as a captain? Shastri responded, “I wouldn’t say too dependent. I think it’s become less as time has gone by because of guys getting experience, exposure. Virat is the biggest wicket for the opposition.

“But, in the last two three years, players like Mayank Agarwal, Rohit Sharma, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane have evolved. They have got better. And the fast bowlers are there to take 20 wickets.”

Stands by Dhoni

The former India allrounder stood by M.S. Dhoni hanging in. “There is the IPL coming. Uske baad tum dekho. Everyone will know. Selectors will know, captain will know, and, more important than anything else, he will know. What I’m trying to tell is he is the last person to impose himself on anything. You know him. I know him. For all you know, he may start the IPL; if he didn’t feel good, he’ll say ‘Thank you very much.’”

Shastri highlighted the reason behind the recent success of Indian cricket. “The vision has been to carry on from where we left off in 2019. I thought that was probably India’s best year, across all formats. For the sheer consistency, the number of wins, ability to adapt and if we had a good 15 minutes in that World Cup, might have been even sweeter. I think it will be a year hard to beat. The only thing missing for these guys is an ICC Trophy. That’s destiny. You have to chase it. Don’t be complacent. Don’t rest on your laurels.”

When asked if India was only beating mediocre teams at home, Shastri said as a matter-of-fact, “I won’t react. My job is to beat sides. We went to South Africa, we won on a treacherous track in Johannesburg. We won in Australia. I don’t care if the opposition is strong or weak. We treat every team as the same.”

Temperament is key

When was a youngster ready to make an international debut? “I would see temperament more than anything. How he handles pressure, how he copes with pace and technique, but, for me, temperament becomes extremely crucial. You might have a guy scoring thousands of runs. But I’d rather like to see a guy who scores the runs when it matters.”

“You don’t have to go to a player and tell him something for the sake of telling it without having a solution to correct it,” he said. “So many times people will come and tell you ‘Tera aage ka pair theek nahi aa raha’ (your front foot is not coming right). I ask ‘toh phir karna kya hai (what is to be done)’. You are testing my mind for nothing. I’m thinking and you’re not giving me the answer.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/its5ji/article30636680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24RAVI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-series-ravi-shastri-interview/article30636681.ece
293,2020/01/24,BJP cadre arrested while taking out Lord Ram procession,"Cadres of the Bharatiya Janata Party took out a procession here on Friday in honour of Lord Ram, in connection with the 1971 event organised by Periyar. They were, however, arrested and removed by police at the starting point of the procession.

Nearly 100 cadres had gathered at Shevapet market area, the starting point of the procession. They garlanded a huge portrait of Lord Ram, Lakshman and Sita and planned to take it in a procession in order to recompense the insult caused by a rally organised by Dravida Kazhagam founder Periyar about 50 years ago.

However, according to police, permission was not granted for the procession and the cadres were arrested and removed over 50 of them from the place for conducting it without permission.

Victory slogans

Former BJP State president K.N. Lakshmanan inaugurated the rally. He told presspersons that “About 50 years ago, Lord Ram was insulted in a rally organised by Dravida Kazhagam founder Periyar. Today, we organised this rally to wipe out that insult and started a procession garlanding Lord Ram. We raised victory slogans in this procession.”

BJP district president R.P. Gopinath said “The procession was organised in honour of Lord Ram and we had planned to start it from the same place where the 1971 rally was conducted .

295,2020/01/24,"700 fire service personnel to counter forest fires, says Sylendra Babu","As many as 700 personnel from Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services are prepared to fight forest fires across the State, said C. Sylendra Babu, Director of Fire and Rescue Services, here on Friday.

He visited the District Fire Office on State Bank Road for an inspection. Speaking to the mediapersons after the inspection, Mr. Babu said that the fire service personnel across the State have been training in controlling fires in forest areas. A total of 331 fire stations are functioning across Tamil Nadu, he said.

In 2019, the efforts of TNFRS personnel led to the rescuing of 250 people alive from various fire accidents across the State, Mr. Babu said.

A total of 25,600 fire calls and 26,800 rescue calls were received by TNFRS last year, he added.

Nearly 3,600 school students across the State were trained to catch snakes and to prevent fire accidents last year, according to Mr. Babu.

A TNFRS official told The Hindu that Mr. Babu operated the equipment available at the fire station and checked the readiness of the vehicles.

He met the District Fire Officers from nine districts (Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Salem, Namakkal, Erode, the Nilgiris, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri and Dindigul) during the visit.

296,2020/01/24,‘Candidates from T.N. will excel in IndiaSkills competition’,"Candidates from Tamil Nadu will excel in the IndiaSkills competition, said V. Vishnu, Managing Director of Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation (TNSDC), here on Friday.

He visited the PSG College of Technology where district level competitions for the IndiaSkills competition were organised on Friday. “We have got really good candidates this year from the sectors where Tamil Nadu is already strong such as automobile, 3D prototyping and robotics,” Mr. Vishnu told The Hindu on the sidelines of his visit.

The competitions will be held at district, State and regional levels prior to the national-level IndiaSkills competition in June, which is organised by the National Skill Development Corporation.

Training

Those candidates who get selected at IndiaSkills will undergo training for a period of eight months to participate in the WorldSkills competition, an international skills-based competition which will be held in Shanghai, China in 2021.

“The fundamental idea is making vocational education aspirational,” Mr. Vishnu said, for which events like WorldSkills will provide an incentive for students to improve their skills.

He noted that TNSDC roped in participants from previous editions of WorldSkills for consultations prior to the district-level competitions and sought the cooperation of District Collectors across the State to create awareness among students to register this year.

As part of the visit, Mr. Vishnu also had an interactive session with the engineering and polytechnic students from PSG College of Technology, where he stressed the importance of skills in the present job market.

He also interacted with M. Kamal Prasath Balaji and T. Dharmaraj, alumni of PSG College of Technology who participated in WorldSkills held at Sao Paulo, Brazil in 2015. A. Latha, Regional Joint Director (Employment), told The Hindu that as many as 11,156 candidates have registered for the district-level competitions in nine districts namely Coimbatore, Tiruppur, the Nilgiris, Karur, Erode, Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri. Among the 1,03,000 candidates registered across India, 24,596 candidates were from Tamil Nadu, Ms. Latha said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/77ym5c/article30647122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB25-TEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/candidates-from-tn-will-excel-in-indiaskills-competition/article30647123.ece
297,2020/01/24,Integrated bus stand work starts in Coimbatore,"Coimbatore will soon have an integrated bus stand near the Coimbatore Corporation’s dump yard. Work to construct the ₹168 crore bus stand on 61.62 acres began on Friday, with Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani participating in the ground-breaking ceremony.

Over the next two years, the Coimbatore Corporation will construct the bus stand. The State Government will fund 50% of the project cost and the Corporation will bear the rest by borrowing the money from a Central Government agency.

The bus stand will have have 140 bays for outstation buses, 112 bays idle parking, 18 disembark points, 33 bays for town buses, 104 parking lots for four-wheelers and 1,200 two-wheeler parking lots and will help around 3 lakh people, said a Corporation release.

The bus stand will provide overnight rooms to commuters who would arrive late at night, rooms for resting for drivers and conductors, separate enclosures for feeding mothers, restaurants, shops and other basic amenities, the release added.

Speaking at a function organised to mark the inauguration of the project, Mr. Velumani said the project was aimed at de-congesting Coimbatore city and helping the city keep pace with its fast-paced development.

There will also be an elevated corridor from the Chengapalli-Walayar bypass road to the bus stand.

The project is the latest in the State Government’s efforts to provide the infrastructure required to the second-largest city in the State and a series of projects aimed at bringing development that the city had not witnessed in the last 50 years.

The Government chose to construct the bus stand in Vellalore because it was where the land required for the project was available.

Mr. Velumani also said the dump yard that was close to the bus stand site would not be a problem because the Corporation had devised a ₹60 crore project to clear the accumulated waste using modern techniques – a reference to the bio-mining project that the civic body would take up to process the accumulated waste and recover the land.

Corporation officials said the civic body was at present not involved the elevated corridor that the Minister spoke about. The civic body has not yet written to the State Highways Department to widen the roads around the bus stand. Given the two years’ time required to complete the bus stand project, there was time on hand for the Corporation to write to the Highways Department.

The officials said the civic body had also not thought of what to do with the bus stands in Singanallur, Gandhipuram or Ukkadam. It would, perhaps, take a decision in the coming months.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/integrated-bus-stand-work-starts-in-coimbatore/article30644032.ece
298,2020/01/24,Coconut trees around Pollachi hit by whitefly attack,"Coconut trees in nearly 1,000 hectares are affected in and around Pollachi because of whitefly attack, claim farmers.

T. Sakthivel, a coconut farmer in Govindanur, said the attacks had reduced during the colder months, but have increased now. Coconut growers in the Pollachi area have been facing the whitefly problem increasingly, during the last two years. “Last year, a committee was formed and farmers were given suggestions on how to control the attack. But the steps are not practical. Now, the impact is greater,” he said.

The farmers say they have given petitions to Agriculture Department officials and the District Collector during the monthly agriculture grievance day programmes. The officials should tell the farmers the steps they need to take to control whitefly attacks, the farmers say.

When whitefly attacks take place, production drops nearly 90 %. “It has started happening,” according to Mr. Sakthivel.

“Come to any farm. We can show you trees with whitefly attacks. The impact is more on hybrid trees,” says Gopalsamy, a farmer at Kollapatti.

An official of the Agriculture Department said the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University has recommended certain measures and the Department is conducting awareness programmes, trainings, and exposure visits for farmers.

The officials also visited some of the farms recently.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/qhfr7s/article30642820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24JANTH-WHITEFLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coconut-trees-around-pollachi-hit-by-whitefly-attack/article30642821.ece

300,2020/01/24,Caution! No trespassing into forests,"The death of a 44-year-old woman from Ganapathy in an elephant attack on January 19, when she and seven others trespassed into the forest near Palamalai for trekking without permission from the Forest Department, highlights the risks and illegality involved in such violations.

According to Forest Department officials, the group was warned twice earlier while trekking in forest areas, including a stretch from Mangarai to Anaikatti.

Following the incident, officials have clarified that there are only five trekking routes approved by the department in Coimbatore namely Thadagam to Melmudi Ranganathar Temple, Poondi Temple to Vellingiri hill shrine, Palamalai to Melmudi Ranganathar Temple, Kallar to Burliar via road, and Odanthurai to Kunjappanai.

According to Additional Principal Conservator of Forests Debasis Jana, (Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle), these places were approved for trekking by the Chief Wildlife Warden.

District Forest Officer D. Venkatesh said that trekking on these routes was allowed only when aspirants apply in advance, that too with certain restrictions considering the safety of the persons and protection of the ecosystem.

“People, who get permission for trekking will be assisted by frontline staff of the department or local tribesmen who know the forest terrain well,” he said.

Though permission was not required for trekking along highways passing through forest areas, the department has the discretion to impose restrictions in situations when movement of wild animals is high or during dry months when forests are prone to catch fire.

This restriction applies to Kallar to Burlier stretch where trekking is not allowed when movement of animals is high.

According to Mr. Venkatesh, the department has banned trekking in forest for a three month period between February 15 to April 15. “Other than these three months, the department can also halt trekking activities on the designated routes during extreme dry periods when movement of animals in search of water and fodder is high. Also, the activity is put on hold when the route is in forest fire prone condition,” he said.

Of the five designated trekking routes, devotees are permitted without collecting fee during festive seasons on routes such as Thadagam to Melmudi Ranganathar Temple and Poondi Temple to Vellingiri hill shrine.

Following the tragedy at Palamalai, the department is planning to keep a permanent check-post at the downhill.

However, manpower constraints pose a challenge.

Meanwhile, the department has stepped up surveillance based on specific information that certain resorts and home stays conduct jungle trails and treks in forest fringes without getting permission.

The department has also got information on some trekking groups, who organise trekking through WhatsApp groups and Facebook pages.

A coordinator of one of such groups told The Hindu that it was conducting trekking after getting permission from the department.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/xbxe42/article30637312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24CBVELLINGIRIHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/caution-no-trespassing-into-forests/article30637313.ece
301,2020/01/24,Shops at Flower Market in Tiruppur demolished,"After months of delay, the Tiruppur Corporation on Thursday removed the outlets at Flower Market on Eswaran Koil Street to construct a new Flower Market under the Smart Cities Mission.

According to Mohamed Shafiullah, Executive Engineer and Assistant Commissioner (Zone – III) of Tiruppur Corporation, the work was delayed owing to the shop owners demands not to carry out the demolition during Deepavali and Pongal festival seasons. In the meantime, the Corporation relocated the outlets to a temporary building constructed at a cost of ₹40 lakh at Cotton Market Complex. “Now that Pongal is over and the shops have been shifted, we have proceeded with the demolition,” Mr. Shafiullah told The Hindu.

With four earth movers and seven trucks, the Corporation demolished nearly 100 outlets including 86 shops which were previously functioning at the site. Anticipating protests from the shop owners, nearly 100 police personnel were deployed during the demolition.

The new Flower Market building will be constructed at the cost of ₹4.47 crore under the Smart Cities Mission and the construction works will commence on Friday, Mr. Shafiullah said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/shops-at-flower-market-in-tiruppur-demolished/article30637270.ece
302,2020/01/24,No effective steps taken to check industrial pollution in Malegaon: NGT,"The National Green Tribunal on Thursday said the Malegaon administration has failed to take effective steps for closure of polluting industries and sought a status report on the issue.

Irked over “unsatisfactory state of affairs”, a bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the commissioner of Malegaon Municipal Corporation, District Magistrate, Superintendent of Police, the member secretary of State pollution control board, and the managing director of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd to appear in person on February 24.

“Though action has been taken, there was no effective closure of operations and the polluting activities were still continuing. There was need for coordination among departments,” the Bench said.

The tribunal’s observation came after perusing a report filed by a committee which stated that though action has been taken, there was no effective closure and the polluting activities were still continuing.

According to the committee, 185 of 190 units having facilities for plastic-related activities and 70 out of 125 sizing units are located in residential area.

No action has been taken to check/prevent entry of vehicles carrying plastic waste into Malegaon city area and unloading of the same, the committee said.

“Remedial measures for identified traffic congestion hotspots are implemented immediately, and solid waste management and sewage management plan are implemented expeditiously as early as possible but not later than the target period of February 2021 and December 2021,” the committee said.

Noting this, the tribunal said that time limit for solid waste and sewage management recommended by the committee is too long and needs to be advanced, in consistent with environment norms

“Compensation needs to be speedily assessed and recovered from the polluters, on ‘Polluter Pays’ principle, as already directed. The compensation should be adequate to meet the cost of restoration so that polluting activity is not profitable. We are of the view that it is necessary to interact with the key officers, after they fully acquaint themselves with the task to be performed,” the Bench said.

An NGT Bench said, “In view of the allegations, we consider it necessary to require CPCB to ascertain the status of compliance of the [previous] directions from all States and Union Territories and furnish a consolidated report to this Tribunal within three months.”

The directions came when the green panel was hearing a plea moved by Khalid Ashraf who sought enforcement of a previous order passed by the Tribunal. In 2017, NGT had prohibited the use of thread made of nylon and synthetic material for kite-flying.

“This Tribunal noted its adverse impact on wildlife and human health and directed prohibition of manufacture, sale, storage, purchase and use of such thread. The direction was to be enforced by the Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories through respective district administration,” the Bench observed while referring to the July 2017 order passed by the green tribunal.

In the execution application moved by the petitioner, it was contended that certain directions were not complied with.

“Several accidents have taken place resulting in deaths or accidents including death of a four year old girl in Delhi... Prohibited thread continues to be manufactured, sold and used. There are casualties of birds from time to time in different parts of the country,” the plea had said.

305,2020/01/24,Kidnap-murder case cracked with arrest of 3,"Delhi Police has solved the Shalimar Bagh kidnap-cum-murder case and arrested three persons allegedly involved in the murder, said the police on Thursday.

DCP (North West) Vijayanta Arya said that on January 4, a man filed a complaint that his brother Satyanarayan (35), a resident of Pitampura village, was missing. Efforts to find the missing person went futile. After the family raised suspicion, police registered a kidnapping case at Shalimar Bagh police station on January 12.

“Teams were formed to collect the data of unidentified bodies. During the exercise, a body recovered from Sahabad Dairy on January 4 was identified by the complainant to be of his brother’s. He also raised suspicion that the deceased’s wife and her male friend were responsible for his death, said Ms. Arya.

Call details help police

During the investigation, the call details of the suspected persons and Satyanarayan were analysed. It was found that Satyanarayan’s wife was in a relationship with his friend Ajay, the officer said.

The wife of the deceased was thoroughly questioned and she broke down and confessed that she was in an extramarital relationship with Ajay. Her husband restricted her to meet Ajay due to which she provoked Ajay to kill him so that they could live together freely, said the police.

3 held from M.P.

“It was found that Sonu and Suresh — friends of Ajay — helped him in the murder. Police conducted raids, but all of them were absconding. After getting a tip-off about their location, a police team was sent to Satna district in Madhya Pradesh. All of them were held with the help of local police and brought to Delhi,” said Ms. Arya.

Ajay conspired to kill Satyanarayan, the officer said. On January 4, Ajay consumed liquor with him and then killed him with the help of his friends, the DCP said.

306,2020/01/24,‘Submit status report in AirAsia case’,"The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to submit a status report of its investigation in a money laundering case lodged against some officials of AirAsia India whose flying licence has been challenged by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy.

Mr. Swamy, in his petition, has challenged the airline’s flying licence and Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to AirAsia. — a joint venture of Tata Group and Malaysia’s largest budget airline AirAsia Berhad.

The High Court directed the agency to submit the status report in a sealed cover before the next date of hearing on May 14.

In his petition, Mr. Swamy has contended that the flying rights granted to the carrier were in violation of the government’s policy on foreign investment. He had stated that according to the policy, foreign investment was allowed only in existing airlines and was not meant for floating or starting a new airline.

The Centre has denied that there was any violation of FDI norms while granting approval to the AirAsia (India) Pvt Ltd. It had said that FDI was permissible in an existing airline as well as a new venture.

308,2020/01/24,Court allows bank to recover house loan dues,"A Delhi court has allowed a public sector bank to recover ₹7.57 lakh from two house loan defaulters and the Amrapali Leisure Valley Pvt. Ltd. from whom the two had bought an under construction flat in Greater Noida in 2013.

According to the loan agreement between the bank, the buyers and the seller, the builder had agreed to return with interest all the loan amount received by him from the purchaser to the bank in the event of the borrower and/or builder/land owner failing to complete the sub-lease/sale transaction and registration thereof.

The flat buyers had taken a loan of ₹25.45 lakh from the bank. After repaying about three-fourth of the loan amount, they defaulted on the remaining amount of ₹7.57 lakh. Despite issuance of demand notices and reminders thereafter, the three defendants failed to honour the loan agreement. Thereafter, the bank approached the court with a recovery suit.

The court decided the matter ex-parte as the defendants failed to appear before it despite the publication of the summons to them in a newspaper. “It is held that the defendants are individually and severely liable to pay to the plaintiff bank a sum of ₹7,57,913, along with accrued interest for the period ending April 4, 2018. The plaintiff bank is also entitled to interest @ 12.25% per annum (including 2% penal interest for the default in payment of EMIs on the due dates, as per the loan agreement), on the said amount with effect from April 5, 2018 till the date of realisation of the said amount,” District Judge Sanjay Sharma-1 said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-allows-bank-to-recover-house-loan-dues/article30638179.ece
309,2020/01/24,Report highlights ‘worrying’ aspects of recruitment of judges,"The abolition of three years of mandatory experience as a practicing lawyer before one could apply and become a District Court judge has led to selection of candidates who are “unlikely to have significant life experiences”, a report by Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy said.

This, the report said, has brought down the average age of new judges in India to about 26-27, except in Kerala where the average age is 33.

“Not only are such candidates likely to have little to no experience at the bar, they are also unlikely to have significant life experiences having lived a sheltered experience with their parents or on a university campus,” the report said.

The issue becomes significant as these judges not only deal with the largest number of cases in the country, but also are the first point of contact for the millions of Indians seeking justice before the courts.

The Supreme Court had in 2002 done away with the minimum experience requirement for becoming a judge on the pretext that it could be compensated through rigorous training at the judicial academies. The Law Commission too had noted in favour of abolishing the requirement.

However, it appear that the Law Commission and the Supreme Court overestimated the ability of the Indian State to impart such skills to young inexperienced advocates through a structured training system, the Vidhi report said.

The report, titled ‘Schooling the Judges — The Selection and Training of Civil Judges and Judicial Magistrates’, has attempted to address this issue by studying two critical aspects — the process of recruiting judges to the district judiciary and their training at the State judicial academies.

‘Worrying problem’

“The most worrying problem with the judicial service examinations conducted in India, according to academics working in this area, is that most judicial service examinations are designed to test candidates on their ability to memorise the law instead of testing their ability to reason and apply the law,” the report stated.

Every High Court now has at least one State judicial academy under its jurisdiction for the purpose of providing induction training to entry-level judges as well as refresher training to sitting judges.

However, providing meaningful induction training to new trainees has proved to be a challenge, the report said, adding that many of the State judicial academies lack the faculty required to deliver a structured induction training programme for new judges.

“In our opinion, if the State judicial academies are to mature into respectable institutions of learning, it is necessary for them to develop independent of the High Courts,” the report suggested.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/report-questions-process-of-recruiting-judges/article30638158.ece

“Usually, I sit in the last row of the bus. But on the day of accident, I sat in the front seat meant for the staff. There were hardly four-five passengers in the bus. The accident occurred near the signal when the bus was coming down the flyover. It all happened suddenly. The impact was such that the school bus turned sideways. I fell down from my seat. One of the woman passengers in the bus started shouting. I calmed her down and went to check the school children. They were injured and were accompanied by a woman.

Taking note of a November 2019 report furnished by the pollution control board, a Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “Let further action be taken in terms of the recommendations and compliance report filed by the Board within one month.”

In its report, the HSPCB had said, “Sewage treatment plant [STP] at Barwala, Haryana, is not complying with the prescribed norms of the HSPCB. The agricultural field of complainant is flooded with discharge of STP water. The STP is installed in a low-lying area and there is no drainage arrangement for the disposal of treated water.”

The Tribunal was hearing a plea moved by Sukhwanti who alleged that the discharged waste water had damaged crops, contaminated groundwater, led to the death of livestock and affected soil fertility.

‘Drainage network’

In a slew of recommendations, the report had suggested “Public Health Engineering Department [PHED] to improve operation and maintenance of STP and make arrangements for laying suitable drainage network for disposal of treated effluents” and “environmental compensation to be levied by HSPCB on PHED for period of non-compliance of Barwala STP as per approved guidelines”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/3dvtrz/article30638080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24NGT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/green-bench-seeks-report-on-petition-alleging-groundwater-contamination/article30638081.ece

317,2020/01/24,"Peaceful protests will deepen democratic roots, says Pranab Mukherjee","Referring to the ongoing agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and a proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise, former President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday said that the “peaceful protests” would lead to a deepening of India’s democratic roots.

Mr. Mukherjee was speaking at the first annual Sukumar Sen Memorial lecture organised by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in memory of the first Chief Election Commissioner of India.

“Indian democracy has been tested time and again. The last few months have witnessed people come out on the streets in large numbers, particularly the young to voice out their views on issues which, in their opinion, are important. Their assertion and belief in the Constitution of India is particularly heartening to see. Consensus is the lifeblood of democracy. Democracy thrives on listening, deliberating, discussing, arguing and even dissent,” he said.

He added: “I believe the present wave of largely peaceful protests that have gripped the country shall once again enable the further deepening of our democratic roots.”

Complimenting the ECI on its achievements, Mr. Mukherjee said challenges remained before the electoral system.

He said the ECI embargoes sanctioning and implementation of development projects during elections, which impacts administration.

He also suggested that the Model Code of Conduct could be amended to ease the restrictions.

On the number of Parliamentary seats, he said that if the freeze on the number was lifted, it could go up to 1,000 Lok Sabha seats. On the issue of women’s representation, he called for the “immediate passage of the Women’s Reservation Bill”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/28tiwy/article30640362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24PRANAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/peaceful-protests-will-deepen-democratic-roots-says-pranab/article30638066.ece

319,2020/01/24,Will focus on building more schools: Atishi,"Amid drumbeats and speakers playing “Lage Raho Kejriwal”, Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal and the party’s Kalkaji candidate Atishi took out a roadshow in the constituency on Thursday.

Thousands of supporters welcomed the leaders by showering rose petals on them. The roadshow, which started from Gurdwara Baba Banda Singh Bahadur in Kalkaji at 5.45 p.m., ended an hour later at C. Lal Chowk. Mr. Kejriwal and Ms. Atishi waved at their supporters from their open jeep but none of them gave speeches.

Before the roadshow, when asked about what are the issues she is focusing on, Ms. Atishi told The Hindu, “I will focus on traffic, providing basic facilities in slums and building more schools.”

‘Solutions for all’

After the roadshow, when she addressed the media, she said: “Kalkaji is a mini Delhi. There are rich people here and also people who live in kachhi colony and jhuggis. Our party’s speciality is that it works for people from all sections — for instance, we take care of traffic issues near posh colonies or solve problems of water and sewer in kachhi colonies and jhuggis,” she said, adding that response from the people has been “extremely positive”.

Many people said they will vote for Mr. Kejriwal even though they did not know the local candidate. Talking about the roadshow, they said it was the first major election rally in the area.

Mukesh Yadav (45), chips and cigarette seller in C. Lal Chowk, is originally from UP and has been a Delhi resident for past 20 years. He claimed that while schools in the city have become better, the work done by the sitting MLA from the constituency – Avtar Singh – has not been enough

Delhiites on schools

“My daughter studies in Class XI in a government school in Nehru place. The teachers are better now,” he said, adding that the school has improved in many ways more than one.

However, Mr. Yadav, who had voted for AAP in the 2015 Assembly election, said the party had promised to make their shops permanent but it is yet to happen.

Two women — Asha (43) and Suman Joshi (51) — who were out to buy vegetables at that time said things are almost the same but their electricity and water bills are less.

“The government hospitals have improved by 50%...they are cleaner and also have more medicines. But more work is needed,” said Ms. Asha from Govindpuri.

Mr. Kejriwal, who the party said will cover 60 constituencies through roadshows, held a rally in Tughlakabad in the evening and in Matia Mahal, Uttam Nagar and Vikas Puri in the morning. He will also hold eight town hall sessions.

320,2020/01/24,Decide if you want a govt. which works or one which only protests: Amit Shah,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Thursday accused the Congress, AAP and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of vitiating the atmosphere of the Capital by “inciting the youth and minorities” to run riot.

“The campaign for Delhi elections begins today, it begins now. It is for you to decide whether you want a government which works for five years or one which only does dharna pradarshan [sit-in protests]...there are as many as 112 Central government schemes which the Kejriwal government is stopping you from getting the benefits of,” Mr. Shah said at his first public meeting in Matiala Assembly constituency, adding: “We will make Delhi the best capital in the world... For 15 years, you gave the Congress a chance and five years ago, the people reposed faith in Kejriwal’s party, but they [AAP] forgot their promises.”

At public meetings in west Delhi’s Matiala and Nangloi Jat Assembly constituencies, with a roadshow through the Uttam Nagar constituency in between, Mr. Shah also alleged that former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Kejriwal and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan “spoke the same language” and questioned their association behind the scenes, in addition to raking up the issues related tothe amended citizenship Act, the Ram Mandir, Article 370 and Jawaharlal Nehru University.

“Just today, [Deputy CM] Manish Sisodia said he is with the people of Shaheen Bagh. If they come to power, will Delhi be safe? Do those who want a riot to occur have the right to be in power? I have been observing that Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal says the same thing that Imran Khan says... I want to ask them what their relationship actually is behind the scenes,” Mr. Shah added.

‘Unfulfilled promises’

He said AAP had promised to open 500 schools, 20 new colleges but not a single one was opened. It had promised to install 15 lakh CCTV cameras, procure 5,000 new DTC buses, give employment to 8 lakh youth but did none of these. Mr. Shah alleged that the Delhi governmentcould not even regularise the services of the employees working on contract. Similarly, he said, neither the promise of free Wi-Fi was fulfilled nor the promise of enacting a Jan Lokpal. “You became CMon the back of the Anna [Hazare] movement but after coming to power, did nothing in this connection. Prime Minister Narendra Modi got the Bill on Lokpal passed in Parliament,” he alleged.

“Kejriwal had said Modiji does not allow him to work and now he is saying that ‘paanch saal khoob kiya kaam, lage raho Kejriwal’. I say Dilli ka peecha chhod do Kejriwal,” he added.

Mr. Keriwal has not won any election in the last five years, including the corporation and Lok Sabha elections, he said.

The Chief Minister and the Congress “never wanted a Ram Mandir” but the BJP and Modiji have “made it possible” and would ensure that, over the next four months, a “towering Ram Mandir” is built.

“Should people who raise slogans asking for the disintegration of India be allowed to roam free? Should refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh not be given Indian citizenship? When we spoke about doing so, people like Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi tried to put stumbling block in our way,” he alleged.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/8244wi/article30638059.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24SHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/decide-if-you-want-a-govt-which-works-or-one-which-only-protests/article30638060.ece
321,2020/01/24,Infra projects under SRDP to get fillip,"The ongoing construction of various infrastructural components under the Strategic Road Development Plan (SRDP) across the city could now be expedited, thanks to completion of the process for property acquisition.

The GHMC Town Planning wing has disbursed cheques worth ₹104 crore towards payment of compensation to those who are set to lose properties for construction of the SRDP structures and also for several road widening proposals in the city.

On several stretches where the project had been launched, the works were progressing at very slow pace owing to lack of funding for property acquisition. Roads dug up and left half way through were giving the commuters nightmarish rides, with project deadlines being extended endlessly.

At L.B.Nagar for example, while the left hand side flyover is complete and being used, the right hand side experiences heavy and haphazard traffic especially during peak hours. Works are in progress also towards Bairamalguda and Nagole side, giving the commuters a hard time near the L.B.Nagar circle.

Property acquisition was pending also at Uppal, Amberpet, Balanagar, Jubilee Hills, Bahadurpura and Nagole, for construction of flyovers as part of SRDP. Even where the owners were willing to hand over the properties, GHMC could not go ahead with demolition, for lack of funds.

Property acquisition has been completed for a few road widening projects as well, on stretches such as Himmatpura-Fateh Darwaza, Hussaini Alam-Doodh Bowli, Balapur-DRDO, Shaikpet-Gachibowli, Lalapet, Chandrayangutta, and others. These apart, hurdles have been cleared for the RUBs at Tukaram Gate and Anandbagh, officials informed.

In all, a total of 201 properties have been acquired from all the locations.

322,2020/01/24,Inter student stabbed to death by senior,"A 17-year-old girl was stabbed to death by her senior in school who was in love with her at Warasiguda in Secunderabad late on Thursday night. After killing the girl on the terrace of her house where she stayed with her mother and siblings, he threw her body behind the building.

The victim, a first-year intermediate student, was stabbed in the throat by Shoeb, a resident of same locality, who had proposed to her but was turned down by her parents, said DCP (North) Kalmeshwar Shingenavar.

“On Saturday night, while returning to his house, Shoeb messaged the girl asking her to come to the terrace of her building. Following an argument, the accused caught hold of her neck, took a broken piece of a flooring tile and inflicted multiple injuries on her throat. And before throwing her body from the building, he hit the girl’s head with a boulder as well,” Mr. Shingenavar said.

The offence took place around 1 a.m. on Friday and came to light at 7.15 a.m. when one Santosh from the same locality found the body and alerted police. Even the victim’s mother searched for her and found a pool of blood and footmarks on the terrace.

According to the officer, Shoeb had fallen in love with the victim, and his parents approached her family with a marriage proposal last year. However, they rejected the offer stating that their girl is too young for marriage and they wanted her to continue the studies, as she was a bright student.

“Aggrieved by the rejection, Shoeb bore a grudge against her and suspecting her fidelity, he decided to take vengeance by eliminating her. As per his plan, he walked into her building, called her to the terrace and killed her,” he said.

When asked if Shoeb sexually assaulted the victim before killing her, the officer said that it can only be confirmed after getting post-mortem result. Shoeb has been booked under Section 302 (punishment for murder) 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence), 354-D (Stalking), Section 11 and 12 of POCSO Act, and is being questioned by the police.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/inter-student-stabbed-to-death-by-senior/article30646200.ece

The palatial school building, open-air amphitheatre, playground, the walls and some of the classrooms were turned into spaces for art, culture and literature.

On a working day, hundreds of people turned up to pick up the schedule and move to events of their choice. The line-up included panel discussions with Andrew Whitehead, Pratik Sinha, Faisal Alkazi, Shanta Gokhale, Manu Pillai, N. Gopi, and Sharanya Manivannan, among others.

A large number of schoolchildren and college students brought in an infectious air of energy and curiosity as they peppered authors with questions. “Jerry Sir, will you sign the book if I bring it now?” asked one student before running to get a copy as Jerry Pinto patiently filled bottles of water for other visitors. “Selfies can wait. First, listen to the author,” he told another bunch of children as they surrounded him under a gnarled tamarind tree. The many rock formations inside the school turned into comfortable perches for visitors as the forecourt became filled up with audience.

Author and translator Shanta Gokhale read passages from her book as well as recounted her experience of acting in Ardh Satya and how the movie industry functioned in that period as Govind Nihalani helmed the project.

Elsewhere, Kuchipudi danseuse Yashoda Thakore placed the tradition of dance in its context. “Temples are not just places of worship. Who built the temples? Obviously kings. They became places of social gatherings and played an important role. Marriages were arranged there. Dance was also part of the culture,” said Ms. Thakore during her interaction.

The multilingual mural with a message created by Suresh K. Nair, the artist from Benaras, got a creative touch as children took up paintbrushes and began creating patterns to etch out the message.

“The government is stifling, cramping and destroying the cinema experience. We are forced to show advertisements about dangers of smoking, and messages about no-harm to animals are mandatory. If it wants, the government can create advertisements about these issues and show. Why should they be shown with the movies,” asked Mr. Gopalakrishnan, who crafted a niche for art movies in the 80s and 90s.

“Online streaming is hurting movies. Cinema is an immersive experience with the ambiance, sound and darkness. Cinema can never be experienced on TV,” said Mr. Gopalakrishnan.

Earlier, in his keynote address, Mr. Gopalakrishnan spoke about the connection between cinema and literature.

“Literature is subjective. Words and sentences take a different meaning for different readers. Cinema, on the other hand, is plastic. It creates one lasting image that is the same for everyone. Cinema is one of the greatest inventions of mankind,” said the maker of movies like Swayamvaram, Anantaram and Mathilukal.

“All forms of art aspire for the stature of literature. Even the terms of appreciation for cinema are drawn from literature. If the movie is moving and beautiful, it is called poetic,” said Mr. Gopalakrishnan.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sz8b1i/article30647359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-LITERATURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/worst-time-to-make-movies-adoor-gopalakrishnan/article30645499.ece
325,2020/01/24,CID names 10 top politicians in Amaravati land scam,"Names of some top politicians in Andhra Pradesh, including former MLAs and Ministers, have cropped up during preliminary inquiries made by Crime Investigation Department (CID) sleuths into the alleged land scam involving purchase of land in capital region of Amaravati.

Investigators stumbled upon documents suggesting that these politicians purchased lands on benami names, allegedly keeping the land owners in dark about the State government’s proposal to include these lands in capital region area. “We are cross-checking the documents available apart from oral statements made by some persons. If substantiating evidence is found, registration of criminal cases would follow automatically,” a top official unwilling to be named told The Hindu.

So far, the investigators reportedly gathered preliminary papers directly or remotely linking 10 politicians to the purchase of lands in capital region on benami names. Citing an example, the investigators said a former Minister had purchased lands in Vaddamanu, Vykuntapuram, Amaravati, Nidamarru, Pedaparimi and Venkatapalem villages. Area of the lands varied from 1.5 acres to 4.10 acres.

Documents collected from Amaravati Sub-Registrar Office indicate the former Minister’s benami purchased one piece of land in November, 2014. “Within a short period, the government declared the area covering this land as capital region,” the investigators said. The land purchasers, police surmise, knew in advance about the announcement of the land as capital region but deliberately kept the owners in dark for fraudulent gain.

A MLC, through his agents whose backgrounds are being verified, had allegedly purchased close to 25 acres of land in Thulluru, Velagapudi, Vykuntapuram, Mandada, Venkatapalem and Dharanikota. Some agents of this politician were running private companies from Hyderabad in Telangana. Transactions relating to these lands were executed before and soon after the then AP government issued Government Order No. 252, the investigators said.

He was the chief guest at the inauguration of the first ever “Biz Summit 2020” organised by the Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association (HYSEA) on ‘Expanding Growth Horizons’.

“The US Consulate in Hyderabad is No. 2 in the world and the city is a credible place for investors for economic growth. Hyderabad is the second largest contributor to India’s IT industry with a growth rate of 17% and its IT exports were at $16 billion in 2018-19. Hyderabad was declared last week as the world’s most dynamic city,” he said.

“Some of the challenges India and US could work on are price control measures, digitization, protecting sanctity of contracts to make the trade relations truly free and equitable.

He said in the services industry, there was scope for tremendous opportunities between US and India and and it came from people to people contact as well as from the governments on technology sharing. The US Consulate in Hyderabad issued two million student visas so far.

329,2020/01/24,K.T. Rama Rao seeks freedom for States to seek funds,"IT and Industries Minister, K T Rama Rao has suggested that the Central government should remove hurdles for States to directly deal with international and national funding agencies for inviting investments for its projects.

KTR argued that there was no substitute for more investment in infrastructure and for it to happen, the Government of India should take some bold steps like giving more capital access to States by relaxing the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) limits and engage directly with funding agencies. The Department of Economic Affairs should ensure this for States like Telangana at least, he said.

The Minister, who participated in a discussion along with industry leaders, policy makers and officials from India, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, argued for utilising the money from the Provident Fund lying idle with the banks.

“We are using social security funds from Canada and Norway but not our own Provident Fund lying with the banks for meagre interest rate. The Central government needs to convince people and use it for boosting the economy,” he felt.

About ₹18 lakh crore of pensions, Provident Fund and other small savings are lying with the banks in the country and these funds can be put to use like what Canada does across the globe, he said.

Citing Telangana government’s initiatives in creating massive Pharma city and mega textile parks, KTR said Centre should bring out new policies on the national industrial and textile parks. Unless this is done, India cannot compete with countries like Vietnam and other South Asian economies that have taken the lead in these sectors.

The IT Minister argued not only for lowering the cost of doing business but also improving the quality of doing business for the existing ones as well as to attract new entrants.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/xcbuc6/article30637364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy24KTRColaCEO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kt-rama-rao-seeks-freedom-for-states-to-seek-funds/article30637365.ece
330,2020/01/24,Treat expert panel proposals on Schedule IX institutions as one lot: AP,"The Andhra Pradesh government has requested the Union Home Ministry which is dealing with the reorganisation issues between the two Telugu States to treat the entire recommendations made by expert committee headed by Shila Bhide as one lot for bifurcating the Schedule IX institutions rather than dealing them on case by case basis.

AP Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney is learnt to have addressed a communication to Union Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla asking the Union Ministry to take necessary action in treating the recommendations at one go rather than “a piecemeal approach of looking at the recommendations pertaining to each institution separately. The request was made on the ground that piecemeal approach could take a very long time to reach any meaningful conclusion and several institutions could remain in a state of uncertainty or protracted litigation.

The development assumes significance in the light of the Union Home Ministry’s direction that in respect of institutions where there are disagreements between the two States, both States could give their views and counter comments so that “such cases can be considered on a case to case basis by it”. The Union Ministry made this observation during the meeting of the Chief Secretaries of the two States it had convened on October 10 last year.

The expert committee had made recommendations relating to division of assets, liabilities and employees in respect of 80 institutions. Recommendations on division of only assets and liabilities of nine institutions were also made while the issue relating to the State Finance Corporation and Singareni Collieries Company Limited is pending with the Central government.

The Telangana government had conveyed its acceptance for recommendations made in respect of 68 out of the 91 institutions listed under Schedule IX and handed over the list of these institutions to the neighbouring State.

The Andhra Pradesh government, however, gave its agreement in respect of 53 out of the 68 institutions without clarifying its stand on the remaining 15 institutions.

Senior officials said the AP government’s request comes in the light of objections raised by Telangana where the definition of headquarter was not followed by the expert committee.

“We are objecting to the expert committee recommendations on de-merger of some corporations in a unilateral way that is not in the interest of Telangana,” a senior official said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/treat-expert-panel-proposals-on-schedule-ix-institutions-as-one-lot-ap/article30637287.ece
331,2020/01/24,Yella Venkateswara Rao: ‘I am still a student’,"Yella Venkateswara Rao became a performer even before he became a student! He was barely seven years old when he gave his first mridangam performance without having had any formal learning.

A completely untutored child, he still impressed the audience. “It was Vinayaka Chavithi and I just took to the stage with only enthusiasm and love for the instrument as my motivators,” he recalls with a laugh. “I must have absorbed the music from the atmosphere around me at home. I am the fifth-generation musician in my family. My father was a violinist and student of music-icon Dwaram Venkataswamy Naidu, my uncle was Yella Rao Somanna and my forefathers too were trained in Carnatic music.”

Today, Carnatic musician Yella Venkateswara Rao has come a very long way — he is considered a legendary percussionist, a mridangam maestro with over 28,000 performances to his credit, and a list of awards and honours which runs into several pages and students whose numbers run into hundreds. He also has the reputation as an activist for the cause of classical music, having influenced the founding of many music departments and institutions related to classical music. Moreover, as a guru, he belongs to that rare breed who teaches only in the old-fashioned style of face-to-face classes and solely based on merit and talent, and without charging his students any fees. His intuitive understanding of the complexity and intricacy that Carnatic music percussion involves, a fertile musical imagination and vast experience have together made him a master of his art. Born in Bhimavaram, Andhra Pradesh, he now lives in Hyderabad. And yes, he did undergo formal training after that initial performance. He was born into a family with a rich musical heritage and he learnt the mridangam under his uncle Somannawho was disciple of Palghat Mani Iyer. “I still consider Palghat Mani Iyer and Palani Subramanya Pillai as my idols.”He adds, with a laugh: “Actually I have had other teachers too — every concert was my guru! I learnt something every time I performed, especially with great artistes as also with upcoming ones.”

He has accompanied with elan, both nervous youngsters as well as icons and maestros of Carnatic and Hindustani classical music.Many of these were jugalbandis.

It is challenging to be an accompanist, he says. “Every main artist has a different baani and style of playing. We have to understand it, adjust to it and provide percussion support in sync with that baani and complement it effectively. We have to add value with our support and enhance and uplift the concert.""

A good accompanist quickly makes the main artist comfortable with him/her so that the audience senses and enjoys a good chemistry between the two of them. This is what Yella Venkateswara Rao does with his rich imagination, great skill and dexterity. He thus contributes immensely to the overall beauty and soukhyam of the concert.

He’d also earned a formidable reputation as a solo artiste. His scholarship combined with rich creativity have made his solo concerts crowd-pullers. The first concert happened entirely by chance. As he reminiscences, “It was around 1970 when I was at Nagarjunasagar to accompany a senior musician who did not turn up. I began playing just to engage the audience on their request as they waited for the main artiste and had to keep continuing as he did not come at all. Finally, the whole concert became a three-and-half-hour solo recital by me. It was God’s grace, or sheer destiny. It was an exhilarating experience and I realised that I had the potential to be a solo artiste. I became aware of the untapped creativity within me and that I had so much more to give to music lovers!”

Indeed, he has given a great deal to the world of classical-music. He has to his credit hundreds of lec-dems and workshops on topics like laya-vinyasam, percussion support, aesthetics of sounds, mathematics of mridangam and tani-avaratanam for mridangam. He has curated many percussion events with unusual themes. His name is part of the Guinness Book of World Records for playing mridangam non-stop for 36-hours. He played for the inauguration function of Ravindra Bharathi, Hyderabad.

The latest award he received is the Sangeeta Vignana Visharada by Vignana Samithi, Hyderabad.

After all these honours and critically appreciated performances, does he have any dreams left. “Oh yes! First I have a great deal more to learn — I am still a student, albeit a senior one. Secondly I would like to establish a dedicated music university in the two Telugu states. I would also like to organise a music show featuring performers of classical music and dance, and folk music and dance.”

What is his advice to aspiring musicians and students of classical music? “Do not be in a hurry to ascend the stage and perform. First strengthen your art and knowledge with untiring practice. Learning should be the focus rather than earning. Today unfortunately people are turning into teachers even as they are still undergoing tutelage and hence are under-equipped to teach.Even at the peak of my career and after receiving many honours I used to do relentless sadhana as I wanted to better myself. Secondly, listening is also very, very vital and not enough time is devoted to this. In our youth, attending a live concert was the only means to access a concert. However, today’s students have so many avenues to listen and learn like YouTube, Facebook streaming, videos, I-Pods, audio archives. I request them to use these resources wisely and enrich their knowledge. Also, face-to-face learning is better than online lessons.This is my advice to music-teachers too.”

Yella Venkateswara Rao also appeals to every parent to introduce their children to classical music. He also advocates classical music and dance classes at the school level. Not all students will become performers or professional musicians, he says, but the exposure to music will enrich their lives in so many ways and stay with them all their life.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/fiin5d/article30642741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf24Yella2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/thehindu-friday-review-telangana/article30642742.ece
332,2020/01/24,"Prateek Kuhad: I support inclusiveness, which is the intent behind the anti-CAA, NRC protests","2019 was a good year for singer-songwriter Prateek Kuhad by his own admission. The thing that capped it off? His song ‘cold/mess’ appearing on former US President Barack Obama’s list of favourite music of the year. The 29-year-old, who has won numerous awards, including an MTV Europe Music Award, and whose last EP, cold/mess (2018), topped the iTunes India all-genre album chart, has also written and composed songs for Bollywood films Baar Baar Dekho and Karwaan, and Netflix series Little Things.

Looking relaxed in a black tee, black shorts and sneakers, Prateek sits down for a chat with MetroPlus before the Zee Live Supermoon concert in Bengaluru on January 22. Forthcoming and articulate, he speaks on a variety of subjects from being on ‘that’ list, the anti-CAA and NRC protests, to writing as catharsis and whether he enjoys touring now.

Edited excerpts:

‘Cold/mess’ making it to Obama’s list. Did that feel like the pinnacle or did you have a far more restrained reaction?

It was a cool thing that happened. I wouldn’t say it is the pinnacle of everything. It is always nice to get any sort of shout-out from somebody as influential as him. But I think things had already been building up to that point. There was a bunch of stuff that happened through December of that year and in 2019, which was monumentally as big for my career, if not bigger. A week before, we had sold out a 9,000 capacity venue in Delhi on a cold night. That does not happen in India a lot.

‘Just write' This idea of waiting for inspiration to strike is a fallacy. I think that's what artistes who are lazy use as an excuse to not write. Writing or any sort of artistic expression, first and foremost, is discipline, craft and work. You might not write amazing songs every single day but you can write. I think my job as a songwriter is to write as many songs as I can and I like doing it so why wouldn't I? Constructing a false reality around you and seeking inspiration is also not the right approach. Inspiration may or may not come but what stays for sure is your own set of skills that you have built through work and discipline. That’s the only thing in your control and that's what every creative person should aim at doing.

The six-song EP cold/mess is referred to as your ‘break-up album’. Can you take us through the song-writing process?

The title song was written at the end of 2015 and I was touring with it. The EP was recorded in 2018 in Nashville, US. The thing is that it is not that black and white. People think that you have a break-up, you write a bunch of songs and then you move on to the next thing. It doesn’t happen like that. I wrote a lot of songs when I was in that relationship and after it also. It was rocky, there were a lot of breaks. I wrote about other things also during that time. Because at the end of the day, it is not just completely personal or driven by writing in a mechanical way. There is a certain skill I have in terms of crafting a song and making a record that I have learned over the years. That is the main thing that enables you to write a song and finish it. The emotional aspect and whatever of your personal life that creeps in is not really controlled. I could write a song today about my break-up seven years ago. It is possible because you could be going through those feelings that day.

So, it’s not like you write about it and it is catharsis...

I used to think it is catharsis and it is, but not in the way that it helps to heal. It is catharsis just in the way that you expend that energy for that moment. It is like a distraction. It’s not necessarily that you write 20 songs about a break-up and ‘you’re like okay I’m over it’. It’s not that black and white. You feel better for the moment, sometimes you don’t. Sometimes, it makes it worse because you are reminded of all that stuff.

Are you more comfortable touring and enjoy being on stage now?

I am definitely more comfortable playing live. I started off as a writer for years before I started touring. What I really loved was being alone in my room and just writing, finishing a song, polishing it, and then getting in the studio and waiting for that end result. The journey is what I really enjoy. Touring came up later because you have to do it. As an artiste, especially the kind of music I do which is live and singer-songwriter, you have to play those shows. It is also a great way to build your fans and spread your music. Also people who listen to your music want to listen to it live. So, I started touring and it started getting intense. That’s really the tough part. Being in the studio, sometimes I can’t believe I am getting paid for this. But the playing live is the part that kind of balances it out because it is very taxing. But over the years I have got used to it. It is better planned and I have a better team around me to smoothen out the rough edges and uncertainties. It’s still hard but I am more comfortable being on stage. I still love writing more but I don’t hate touring as much as I did.

You were scheduled to perform in Bengaluru in December but it was cancelled as Section 144 was imposed owing to the anti-CAA and NRC protests. What are your thoughts on the issue?

I don’t really have a very concrete opinion on it. I went to one of the protests in Delhi at Shaheen Bagh. I think the spirit of the protest itself is lovely. It is heart-warming actually because it is just people getting together and helping each other out. Obviously, the true intent behind the protests, which is basically inclusiveness, is something I support strongly. But, I think the CAA, the technicalities of the Act itself and the complications of the population and politics in this country are just way too complex to discuss in a small interview.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/e6ev2z/article30642233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGMPRATEEKLIVE2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/prateek-kuhad-i-support-inclusiveness-which-is-the-intent-behind-the-anti-caa-nrc-protests/article30642237.ece
333,2020/01/24,Band Arzz is high on Bollywood,"Arun Fialok begins the conversation with a simple math. “We have done a total of 332 gigs in Hyderabad in a span of three years. So on an average we have been performing in the city every three days,” It is no surprise that the founder of Band Arzz with a tagline ‘A Musical Call’ considers Hyderabad his first home.

Nine years ago, Arun and his school friend Puneet Guglani began playing music in their hometown Chandigarh. The enthusiastic youngsters performed during festivals and functions as a pastime. Even while teaching at school, the duo continued their musical shows and a few unplanned performances grew in number. It was when people began appreciating their kind of music, that the duo realised music was their calling and Band Arzz came into existence. They quit their jobs, moved to Delhi and were playing at a Delhi night club when two Hyderabadis approached them for an event. “That proved a turning point in our musical career,” says Arun, who also anchors their shows.

The artiste lineup of Band Arzz has changed over the years and presently comprises Arun (manager, lead performer), Puneet (lead vocals and guitar), B Sai Vikas (bass), Rakesh Roshan (drums), Lovely Ratra (keys), Sunny Deyali (electric guitar) and Udit Malhotra (percussions). From Bollywood, Punjabi party songs, Sufi and folk songs medley and improvised tracks and tunes... they play it all, at various venues and events — weddings, corporate events, college and club shows in Hyderabad and other cities. “Delhi-based Gargi College, affiliated to Delhi University, never repeats artistes at its shows, but it is a record that we have performed there twice,” declares Arun proudly.

The band is best-known for its medleys of film songs from every era. They begin with an old classic Lag Ja Gale Ki Phir Yeh (Woh Kaun Thi) and effortlessly shift to a Govinda number Main Toh Raste Mein Jaa Raha Tha (Coolie No. 1) making people in the audience wonder if they can read their minds! “Our USP are the instant medleys and selection of songs. We surprise the audience by shifting to different songs. Even if we perform a very popular number, our style brings in a new flavour to it; the energy we bring to the stage has to be experienced.”

Their performances have seen them present a whopping 150 songs in a medley. “We perform, dance and sing, working the crowd and they simply go along with us; every song has variety.” Comparing the crowds at Chandigarh and Hyderabad, Arun observes that Chandigarh audience always prefer peppy Punjabi numbers. “They like dance numbers. They want only entertainment whereas in Hyderabad, people never get bored. They like music and entertainment and look forward to listening to all kinds of music. Mumbaikars are also good but Hyderabad is the best.”

With three more international shows, the team looks forward to work on original compositions.

337,2020/01/24,Woman falls to death from tenth floor of flat,"A woman died after she reportedly jumped off the tenth floor of her apartment complex near Kathrikkadavu on Thursday around 6.15 a.m.

The body was found on an extension of the second floor. The deceased was identified as Elsa Leena Maria, 38, who hailed from Thiruvalla.

The police said that she had been staying in the tenth floor apartment with her nine-year-old daughter and mother.

“It appears to be a case of suicide. The victim had reportedly gone for morning walk and jumped from the common corridor on the tenth floor by climbing on a cycle kept by the side. Her mother was the first one to be alerted and spotted the body,” said North police sources.

The mother recovered a note left behind by the woman, which she handed over to the police. According to the police, the note hinted at family discord and depression for which she was under medication. She was working as a tutor in an aviation institute.

Her death sent shock waves through the apartment and among her friends and relatives.

“She was a very jovial person and actively participated in the programmes at the church. Though she was learnt to have some family discord, it’s not clear whether that led to this extreme action. It’s just shocking to say the least,” her friend said on condition of anonymity.

339,2020/01/24,CAA meet issue snowballs into controversy as video goes viral,"A symposium on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) for women organised by a Sangh Parivar outfit at the Pavakkulam Temple auditorium at Kaloor has snowballed into a controversy after a video went viral in social media that showed a woman being shoved around and even subjected to communally sensitive comments for allegedly trespassing into the event and questioning the legislation.

Flurry of petitions

This has now sparked off a flurry of police petitions with C.V. Sajini, secretary of the industrial cell of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), lodging a complaint with the North police against the woman while Raju P. Nair, general secretary of the District Congress Committee, petitioning the District Police Chief (Kochi city) demanding legal proceedings against the women who allegedly made sexist and casteist remarks against the Muslim community, under the relevant provisions of the CrPC.

The petition of Mr. Nair, who was one of the first to share the video in social media, has been handed over to K. Laljy, Assistant Police Commissioner (Ernakulam), for investigation.

FIR registered

The North police have registered a First Investigation Report against the woman, merely identified as Athira from Thiruvananthapuram, invoking IPC Section 447 (criminal trespass) and 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place). As per the police, she is a makeup artist staying at a hostel next to the Pavakkulam Temple.

Case transferred

The case was transferred to the women’s police station on Wednesday as both the parties involved were women.

“We have just launched the probe and its premature to say anything,” said women’s police station sources.

The police have also registered a case against the participants of the event based on a complaint by the woman.

“We have taken her statement in which she has complained of being assaulted and abused,” said Mr. Laljy.

According to the police, she was on her way to the bank when she happened to overhear the speech following which she went to the venue and asked to stop the alleged propagation of lies.

Mothers’ get-together

The event, labelled as Mathrusangamam (a get-together of mothers), was organised by Jana Jagratha Samithi, a platform of Sangh Parivar, on Tuesday.

The drama started unfolding when Ms. Sajini was addressing the gathering in the middle of which the woman approached the dais and reportedly asked the former to switch off the microphone and stop propagating lies.

This did not go down well with a section of the participants who started heckling her as could be seen in the video. Shortly, she was shoved out of the auditorium at which point one participant, whom Mr. Nair accused as particularly nasty based on the video, made a derogatory comment on a particular community.

“It was not a publicised event and was limited to invited guests into which this woman trespassed with vested motives. The video that had gone viral was grabbed by a man who had accompanied her and there seems to be a larger conspiracy behind the incident, which the police will now have to unearth,” Ms. Sajini said.

‘Normal response’

A.T. Santhosh, district secretary of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, justified the response of the participants towards the woman. “She wasn’t assaulted but was simply shoved out of the auditorium, which was only a normal response,” he said.

FB post

A screen shot of a post against Hindutva forces allegedly from the Facebook page of the woman was also circulating among the Sangh Parivar circles.

340,2020/01/24,SMS to passport holders,"MADURAI

The Ministry of External Affairs has commenced a new service to inform all passport holders on the date/month of expiry of their passports.

This is to ensure that all the passport holders renewed the passports on time. Many of the passport holders forgot the month/year of expiry of their passports.

A majority of the countries insisted on a minimum of six months validity of the passports for the purpose of travel. Hence, at the last moment, when passport holders realised that the month or year in the booklet had expired, the journey became impossible.

Hence, as a service, the Ministry of External Affairs had proposed to send SMS to the registered mobile numbers twice — at the ninth and seventh month prior to the expiry date to the passport holders, said Regional Passport Officer Arun Prasad in a press release issued here on Friday.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/sms-to-passport-holders/article30646873.ece
341,2020/01/24,Chamber submits pre-budget representation to Centre,"MADURAI

A delegation from the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, including Senior President S. Rethinavelu, President N. Jegatheesan and Secretary J. Selvam, made a representation to the Union Finance Ministry ahead of the 2020 union budget on Wednesday.

In their pre-budget memorandum, the members of the industry said that he tax rate should be limited to three rates, 5%, 10% and 15% only.

“For sin goods and super luxury cars, 20% tax, apart from the basic cost may be levied. The maximum Goods and Service Tax rate for services should only be 15%,” the organisation members said in a press statement.

The release also insisted that essential food products, including branded products, should be exempted of all taxes so that more manufacturers are encouraged to do branding and ensure quality. In the area of environment, the statement said that the biodiesel industry, which uses used cooking oil as feedstock, should be encouraged by reducing GST on the fuel from 12% to 5%.

In order to avoid confusion of different GST rates, the organisation proposed scrapping of the State-level Authorities of Advance Ruling (AAR) post.

“There should be only one national-level AAR to confirm rate of tax for commodities and that should be binding on all at pan-India level,” the statement said.

The organisation also suggested the formation of a high-level committee with members from Chambers of Commerce and Industries across the country to engage in a direct discussion with the GST council.

The Chamber also called for the basic exemption limit for individual income tax to be increased to at least ₹ 5 lakh from the present limit of ₹ 2.5 lakh.

“With sliding economic growth and decelerating GDP in the country, there is an imperative need to put more money into the hands of the consumers at large in our country. This in turn should enlarge their purchasing power, stimulate industrial production, more employment generation and incentivize GDP growth,” the statement said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/chamber-submits-pre-budget-representation-to-centre/article30646830.ece

345,2020/01/24,Poor attendance at govt.-sponsored NEET coaching causes concern,"MADURAI

Although there are 15 centres providing Tamil Nadu government-sponsored National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) coaching in Madurai district, students who regularly attend classes are a very few, according to teachers conducting the classes.

According to an official from the Education department, a total of 980 students showed interest in being part of the State-sponsored coaching every weekend until the run-up to the exam in April.

However, there are no official records of the number of students regularly attending the classes. One of the teachers says that there are usually 40 to 50 children who are assigned to each coaching centre. Policy dictates that there should be at least one such centre for each union.

Writer and teacher Libi Aranya said that in some centres with a sanctioned strength of 40 students, not even one-fourth turns up to classes. He attributes them to a number of reasons and says that the government-sponsored coaching bears the mark of systemic failure.

“Government teachers are deputed on rotation basis for coaching in their respective unions. Without a dedicated set of teachers to understand the performance of these students, it may be impossible for specialised training and proper continuity of lessons,” he says.

He adds that another major flaw in the process of coaching is that students barely get between 30 and 40 sessions overall to supplement their regular education and later write the NEET.

“Anyone who has attempted the exam will clearly state that 30 sessions with a week’s gap will hardly make a difference to the preparation. Students need rigorous and intense training to crack this exam as their regular syllabus is different and as difficult to write. Science students especially have to study several volumes to get a good score in the board exam and later write NEET too,” he says.

State Coordinator of the Save Higher Education Movement of Tamil Nadu R. Murali says that though the idea is to appeal to students from rural areas to take up the exam, there is a confusion and fear taking up the exam based on the pass percentage from previous years. He says that lack of proper Tamil NEET coaching material is another barrier for socially disadvantaged students from rural areas.

Mr. Aranya says that the Tamil Ndu government is choosing to assess the success of those writing NEET exams based on those who have cleared cut-off whereas this must ideally be based on the number of these students getting seats in medical colleges.

“Through the previous system, rural students at least had proper windows to achieve their dreams. The teachers were trained in the syllabus and enough time was given for aspiring doctors with special a coaching on school campuses. However, with poor results and poorer enrolment rates for government coaching, the dream of becoming doctors may become inaccessible to these students,” he says.

District Chief Educational Officer (CEO) R. Swaminathan says that the dip in numbers is probably because of the series of holidays in the recent past.

He says that coaching is going on as scheduled for all students in these unions. Another source from the department says that Headmasters and Headmistresses from unions with poor attendance are personally called by District Education Officers and the CEO to boost the number of students attending these classes.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/poor-attendance-at-govt-sponsored-neet-coaching-causes-concern/article30645750.ece

347,2020/01/24,Delay in completion of Kalavasal flyover worsens traffic congestion,"MADURAI

The delay in completion of Kalavasal flyover, which was supposed to be completed in October 2019, has increased traffic congestion and caused inconvenience to road users.

With worsening air quality and recurring accidents at the junction, the road users are demanding its faster completion.

The Kalavasal junction is where the Madurai-Theni highway and Madurai-Dindigul Bypass road meet. Currently, the four lane flyover is under construction at this junction on the Madurai- Dindigul Bypass Road.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, while laying the foundation stone for the flyover in July 2018, said that the project would be completed in 15 months.

B. Raja, an autorickshaw driver, said that currently the congestion had peaked as vehicles had to pass through reduced carriageway due to the construction work.

“Raw materials, including gravel, mud and even constructed beams, are kept on the road, thus reducing the carriageway. On an average, it takes around 15 minutes to cross the junction during peak hours,” he said.

Though traffic snarls are common on all the four roads in the junction, the congestion at the Madurai-Theni highway is worse, complained a police official at the junction.

“During rush hours, vehicles stand up to Mudakkuchalai on one side of the Madurai-Theni highway and on the other side, vehicles wait up to Arasaradi. Managing traffic within the available space becomes an uphill task,” he said.

Among the road users the ambulance/emergency service vehicles are the worst affected, according to C. Boopathi, a shopkeeper.

“Though vehicle users try to make way for ambulances, their efforts become futile, as there is hardly any space left for vehicles to manoeuvre. Adding to this problem are share autorickshaws which occupy the entire left carriageway,” he complained.

The traffic police also added that he continued to experience coughing and breathing difficulties because of the dust pollution at the junction.

The frustrated vehicle users who hurriedly want to pass through the junction tend to violate rules and this causes a significant number of accidents every day, complained the traffic police.

The General Secretary of Madurai Consumer Protection Centre G. Muniasamy had filed a petition at Madurai Bench of Madras High Court over the delay in completion of the flyover.

“On an average around 1.42 lakh vehicles cross the junction every day. Hence, the work needs to be completed soon,” he said.

An official from the State Highways Department said that with 70% of work having been completed, the flyover will be ready by March 31. The official said that the delay in shifting electric poles was the major reason and hoped officials would be able to dedicate it to the public in about 60 to 75 days.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/roh0aa/article30645532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA25CITY-TRAFFIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/delay-in-completion-of-kalavasal-flyover-worsens-traffic-congestion/article30645533.ece

Access to official documents at the Controller of Examination’s room by an unauthorised individual at the Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) has created controversy.

Vice-Chancellor M. Krishnan confronted the Controller of Examination O. Ravi on Thursday evening after the individual owning a distance education centre in Periyakulam in Theni district was found handling a series of consolidated marksheets, according to a source privy to the conversation.

Following a tip-off from a source at the university, the VC who was going on rounds at around 7 p.m. reached the controller’s room and found the individual sorting through the marksheets belonging to various students of the university and keeping aside a set of these marksheets of students belonging to his centre.

The controller was also said to have been present inside the room at the time, according to the source.

“We have received similar updates of owners of centres walking into the controller’s room to receive their certificates without utilising the proper channels. It is widely known that these distance education centres are yet to pay their dues to the university. The matter is going to be investigated,” the source added.

The source said the VC had also received a written acknowledgement from the controller that an individual was seen handling consolidated marksheets.

“However, the controller in the letter had said that he was in the adjacent room on the phone while the individual was looking at the files and was not involved,” the source added.

Mr. Ravi refused to comment on the matter and said that the administration would handle the issue.

The source said the university administration was likely to constitute a committee to investigate such malpractices. It would raise the issue in the forthcoming Syndicate meeting, the source added.

Mr. Krishnan said that he was likely to issue a statement on the matter on Saturday.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/access-to-documents-at-mku-controllers-office-by-individual-creates-controversy/article30645287.ece

351,2020/01/24,Marigold farmers face loss due to poor price,"Farmers cultivating marigold flowers near Chinnalapatti near here, rue price crash due to abundant yield.

Marigold flowers in yellow and orange colours are raised in hundreds of acres in many villages in the region, including Seevalsaragu, Oothupatti, Kamalapuram, Perumalkovilpatti, Jathigoundanpatti, Thoppampatti, Nadupatti, Kathirpatti and Pachamalayanpatti.

The flower yields in about two months after planting and is used in garlands, weddings, decorations and rituals. However, this year the flowers have yielded in abundance and hence, are not getting the right price in the market. The demand was also not as expected during the Pongal festival, causing a slump in prices.

A kg of marigold flowers is sold for as little as ₹ 20 in the Dindigul and Nilakottai flower markets and farmers are left in the lurch.

“We have not been able to reap even the invested amount and are facing huge losses,” says Savudan, a farmer in Bommanampatti.

“We fetched saplings from Hosur and Siruvani near Coimbatore for ₹ 1.80 per piece and planted them. It takes about 15,000 saplings per acre and the investment goes up, including fertilizers and water.”

A variety of vegetables such as carrot, cabbage and cauliflower are grown in the hilly regions of Meghamalai and farmers carry their produce to the Chinnamanur market. There’s only a dirt track that connects Bommayanayakkanpatti and farmers are allowed to use it only once a week.

“We should be allowed at least thrice a week. Otherwise, vegetables perish. We transport them to Chinnamanur in a goods carrier vehicle from where it goes to Theni and other markets in the district,” said the farmers.

Wildlife Warden of Meghamalai Wildlife Sanctuary Sachin Bhosle said that access through the forest area is restricted to once a week as there are wild animals in the pocket. However, he said that the demand would be considered. “But only one vehicle will be allowed to use the path even if it’s for thrice a week.

The issue of grazing permits for cattle was also raised. Farmers rearing the native breed of ‘malaimadu’ that graze in the foothills of Western Ghats complained that the forest department had only issued 600 permits which are insufficient as there are about 10,000 cattle.

“Thousands of applications were submitted with due documents as demanded but the department has brought down the number of permits compared to the previous years. This will force people to abandon native cattle,” said Kennedy from Malaimadu Valarpor Sangam.

However, the Wildlife Warden said that the permits had been restricted to prevent large scale degradation of forest areas owing to extensive grazing and said that no more permits would be issued.

A section of farmers demanded fishing rights in village ponds and tanks. The positive monsoon and timely release of water from the dams had ensured water flow to majority of tanks in the district and waterbodies were full of with fish life, they pointed out and appealed that locals should be allowed to fish in village ponds and tanks and outsiders should be restricted from fishing.

357,2020/01/24,A potential tourism spot along the Vaigai lies in utter neglect,"Till the early 1990s, the park at Viraganoor regulator was a thriving picnic spot that attracted a large number of visitors, recalls M. Kannan, a resident of Kalmedu for the past 40 years. “The park had a well-maintained garden with rows of rose plants, a water fountain and play equipment for children. In the evenings, boys used to sell sundal and families used to have a good time. But, today, it is in a shambles,” he says.

Located about eight km from Madurai, the Viraganoor regulator is the second among the three regulators that channelise the Vaigai water. Until the 1990s, it was a perfect getaway spot for the residents. A trip to the regulator was a compulsory entry for schools in their academic calendar.

But, today, due to poor maintenance, the park presents a withered look.

There is a wild growth of thorny shrubs all along the park. It is littered with plastic cups, bags and food wrappers.

The concrete benches are broken and the water fountains remain dysfunctional. Mounds of dry leaves are found throughout the park and there are no signs of any play equipment for children.

Currently, the regulator serves merely as a link for the villagers of Sakkimangalam, Kalmedu, Kalanjiyam Nagar to the highway.

With a dearth of open spaces in the city, the residents are demanding the revival of the park to make it an attractive tourist spot.

The regulator

The regulator was inaugurated by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in November 1975.

The need for a regulator was felt, as earlier the supply of Vaigai water to Ramanathapuram and Sivaganga districts was unregulated, says former Executive Engineer of Public Works Department S. Suthanthira Amalraj.

The regulator diverts water into the Right Main Canal that runs for a distance of 46 km and feeds 60 tanks. The Left Main Canal has a length of 30 km and feeds 27 tanks. The canals have a total ayacut area of 40,743 acres.

The regulator also helps in diverting water during flood, explains Mr. Amalraj.

“In a situation when there is excess water at Ramnad Big Tank, surplus water is discharged into Kiruthumal river through a vent that is present at the regulator,” he says.

The contrast

This regulator was once a hangout for families entering the city from Ramanathapuram, says Mr. Kannan. “After a long tiring journey, they would have their lunch under the shade of the trees at the park and then proceed towards the city,” he says.

V.P. Manikandan, a resident of S.S. Colony recalls that in 1988 when he was a Class 4 student, special NCC camps were held at the park.

But, today, school students who come from even Sivaganga and Virudhunagar districts return disappointed due to the poor upkeep of the park, says K. Kesavan, a shopkeeper near the park. “There are big old trees present in the park. All they have to do is to regularly undertake maintenance of the park,” he says.

The other main problem is the discharge of sewage into the Vaigai from several outlets in the city.

Rise in discharge

A PWD official says that for the past eight years, the discharge of sewage from areas like Anna Nagar, K.K. Nagar and Teppakulam has increased.

As a result, sewage gets stagnated on the flanks of the regulator. Water hyacinth, which thrives only on contaminated water, is found on the flanks of the regulator. “The stench from the stagnated sewage has also deterred people from visiting the regulator,” says Mr. Kesavan.

The PWD official says that the groundwater quality has deteriorated due to stagnation of sewage for years. “This can also be a reason for the plants at the park getting withered,” he says.

A tourist hub

If the officials develop and maintain the park properly, it has the potential to become an attractive tourist spot like Vaigai dam, says Mr. Manikandan.

“The officials can even opt for a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model to develop and handle the upkeep of the park. For further maintenance they can also collect a nominal fee from the visitors,” he adds.

A PWD Assistant Engineer says that the department had prepared an estimate worth ₹3 crore for renovating the park.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/aud9iy/article30640084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MACITY-PARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/a-potential-tourism-spot-along-the-vaigai-lies-in-utter-neglect/article30640086.ece

Addressing presspersons, he said that the first batch will have 100 students and 25 faculty members. The vidyapeetha will be modelled on the lines of the ancient University of Takshashila and will focus on providing integrated Indian education with modern education. The vidyapeetha will require an initial investment of ₹ 50 crore, including statutory fees payable to the government bodies, he said.

He said that while the final aim is to provide education from first standard to post-graduation, to start with, classes will begin in seven departments of under-graduate and post-graduate courses. The vidyapeetha will have 12 faculty, 80 departments and 280 courses.

A note said that all knowledge attained by education in ancient India will be included in syllabi. Four vedas, four upavedas, six vedangas, epics, feasible art forms from the 64 ancient arts, agriculture and many more areas will form the syllabi.

Tahsildars will head those task forces, she said at a meeting of the District Disaster Management Authority here on Thursday.

The Deputy Commissioner said that more boats will be procured and given to Home Guards and Fire and Emergency Services this year as the administration had faced dearth of boats to shift people during rescue operations in flood-hit areas during the last rainy season. Hence, there should not be any problem to shift people to safer places in such an eventuality.

She said that schools too should have their own disaster management plans and asked the officials concerned to take precautionary measures through their respective departments.

The Deputy Commissioner also asked the officials to carry in their vehicles kits having emergency material used during natural disasters. Superintendent of Police B.M. Lakshmiprasad was present at the meeting.

At another meeting, the Deputy Commissioner asked the officials to make use of funds reserved for the welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes appropriately.

364,2020/01/24,The origin of the Constitution,"The world marvels at how well the Indian Constitution has kept a diverse country together for more than 70 years. It’s robustness and durability rest on its many built-in safeguards securing citizens’ rights to freedom and justice and fair play which no government, however powerful, can hope to effectively recast within the space of a single or even multiple tenures in office.

A long history

Mistakenly, however, this lengthy founding document of the Indian Republic is believed to have been completed solely by the Constituent Assembly, working flat out in just two years, eleven months and 17 days. In fact, the Constitution’s long history stretches to over 40 years before its enactment, going all the way back to the Indian Councils Act of 1909. This law, for the first time, brought Indians into governance at central and provincial levels, albeit in a very limited way, through a highly restricted and unrepresentative electorate split on communal lines.

The Government of India Act, 1919 was a vast improvement on the Indian Councils Act but remained unrepresentative. It also persisted with communal representation, which had earlier been endorsed by the Congress and the Muslim League through the Lucknow Pact of 1916.

In its report submitted in 1930, the Simon Commission, constituted to evaluate the Government of India Act of 1919, recommended much greater Indian involvement in the governance of the country. What followed its report were three extraordinary roundtable conferences — in 1930, 1931 and 1932 — all held in London to see how best Indians could administer their country.

Deliberations in these conferences brought out the concerns of different communities, especially the Depressed Classes of which Ambedkar was the de facto leader, and the Muslims led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Except the second conference, which Gandhi attended, the other two were boycotted by the Congress.

These conferences gave voice to other interest groups too — those representing women and Anglo-Indians, for instance — and led to the passage of the Government of India Act of 1935, much of which found its way into the Constitution.

As even a cursory perusal of their proceedings will bring out, the roundtable conferences were no sham. They were remarkable for discussing, debating and comprehensively documenting a range of issues — federalism, civil services, regional representation, fundamental rights and universal adult franchise. Even the idea of linguistic states and reservation emerged from the discussions at the three roundtable conferences.

It is stunning to see how closely and logically the Constituent Assembly deliberations were an extension of the discussions in the three roundtable conferences. Ambedkar’s brilliant interventions in the Constituent Assembly discussions, for example, were the outcome of the understanding he had developed of many issues discussed in the Simon Commission proceedings and the three roundtable conferences which he attended.

A distinct departure

The roundtable conferences represent a distinct departure in British approaches to India. There was a clear recognition that the subcontinent was becoming increasingly difficult to manage and unless some sort of autonomy was given while leaders like M.K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who believed in peaceful protest, were influential, an armed struggle would follow, possibly under a leader like Subas Chandra Bose.

Seventy years on, we can be more honest about the Constitution’s very real underpinnings. Sadly, this fact has been excised from our collective memory. It is almost as if we are ashamed to disclose the colonial origins of our Constitution. On the other hand, we must be proud that the Constituent Assembly were willing to incorporate the best from anywhere – whether they were ideas from our former colonialists or, as in the case of the Directive Principles of State Policy, borrowed from the Irish Constitution.

365,2020/01/24,A former Princess talks to a Prince,"There are princes who give up their royal titles — that is Prince Harry for you. There are also “princes” who find themselves divested of a crown they never wore — that is Prince Frederick for you.

This bizarre event happened in 2004. It illustrates how the reporting field can unexpectedly turn the humble reporter into the main character of his own story, and this may sometimes mean being trussed up in ill-fitting royal robes. This was not immersion journalism, where the reporter consciously integrates himself into a situation from the beginning to present it effectively to the reader. In such stories, there is usually meticulous planning before the reporter throws himself in into the deep end to experience the unknown. This was a case of the reporter simply being swept into the story and made the frontispiece.

It was a straightforward assignment. I had to do an interview with a businesswoman from the U.S. reportedly at the helm of half-a-dozen enterprises. She was married to Paul Kangas, an accomplished presenter of business news who was known for his long association with Public Broadcasting Service’s ‘Nightly Business Report’. She also happened to be a former princess of Bulgaria, having been decrowned when Communism was on the ascendancy in the Balkan state.

Peni Kangas (nee Angeloff), the businesswoman-princess, was launching a line of food products at a store in Chennai. The brief handed to me by my editor was that I write a short profile, keeping the focus on Kangas the person, as it was meant for a lifestyle supplement of The Hindu.

The event organiser had barely introduced me to the former princess when I found myself at the listening end of some very kindly advice.

With an air of commiseration, she proceeded straightaway to comfort me for the loss of my royal title. The crux of her message was that titles meant little, and if we focussed on developing our indestructible inner essence, we would be well on the way to having the best the world has to offer.

Cottoning on to what was happening, the organiser placed the facts on the table. He told her that there had never been anything “princely” about me. To my credit, I said the same thing as quickly as I could.

But she persisted with offering me sincere life lessons, even after realising that I was a commoner from the cradle. The interaction proved that titles after all did not mean anything to her.

I made this exchange the central point of the profile. After that interaction, our paths never crossed again. However, many years later, I was glad I presented the human side of this businesswoman, because her commiserating nature seemed to have largely defined her for the people who had known her well.

In 2010, her obituary that I found online made a clear and pointed reference to it. Obituaries are usually kind. But I have reason to believe this one presented the facts as they were, thanks to that interaction at the store in 2004.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/pqgn7k/article30636315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THPENI,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/a-former-princess-talks-to-a-prince/article30636316.ece
366,2020/01/24,Will the Budget suspend the FRBM’s fiscal deficit goals?,"With revenue receipts lagging behind budget estimates and economic growth slowing sharply, there is a real risk of the Centre missing its fiscal deficit target this year. In a discussion moderated by Suresh Seshadri, N.R. Bhanumurthy and Ajit Ranade look at how the Union Budget may approach the fiscal balancing act in the face of a need for a stimulus and the government’s stated commitment to adhere to the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM). Edited excerpts:

How realistic does the FRBM’s goal of reducing the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP by March 2021 appear now?

N.R. Bhanumurthy: First of all, I would like to say that the FRBM amendments that were part of the Finance Bill 2018 are very different from the original FRBM Act of 2003. The original FRBM Act had said that you have to bring down the fiscal deficit to 3% and the revenue deficit to 0%. The 2018 Finance Bill actually did away with the revenue deficit target. So, there is no revenue deficit target any more. Rather, we have the target of bringing down the fiscal deficit to 3% and at the same time, we expect that that will bring down the public debt to 40% at the Central level.

In my view this is a very flawed kind of FRBM roadmap that the Central government has adopted. To that extent I am not really concerned about bringing down the fiscal deficit to 3% because if you look at the last two years, the fiscal deficit has been brought down to 3.3% and the revenue deficit is actually increasing; that itself violates the original FRBM Act.

In principle, the FRBM is basically an expenditure switching mechanism, where you try to switch the expenditure from consumption to capital. That would lead to higher GDP growth and then lead to reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio. What we are seeing is not expenditure switching from consumption to capital, but we are actually seeing a switch from capital to consumption. And that would be growth retarding, in my view.

What is likely to be the impact from a markets, ratings and investment perspective if the Budget does end up signalling at least a temporary suspension of the fiscal deficit goals?

Ajit Ranade: Since the last quarter of calendar 2018 and the subsequent three quarters, we have seen declining GDP growth to the extent that nominal GDP growth [estimated at 7.5% for the full fiscal year] will be the lowest in the last 42 years. This is an alarming number. Even real GDP growth is very low, below 5%. So, clearly this is evidence of lack of demand — whether it is for consumption, investment or exports — and it requires a growth impetus. In the short run, the biggest impetus comes from fiscal stimulus. Now the thing about the fiscal responsibility act, the fiscal discipline Act, is that it tends to be what is called ‘pro-cyclical’.If you are going to focus on just a number, discrete 3% of GDP, so when the GDP itself is small now, the growth is slower, the 3% is going to be more. And when the GDP is rising fast the 3% is not so bad. You want a higher deficit spending to boost growth if you believe that the government spending is going to help. So, for fiscal policy to be effective, it has to be counter-cyclical. But the way the fiscal responsibility act has been framed, if you are only focussing on a number from year to year, it ends up being pro-cyclical. So, actually the spirit of the fiscal responsibility act should have been over a business cycle. So over a multi-year horizon it should be declining. That is the sign of fiscal discipline. But there should be room for governments to spend extra when needed. That is an important point to note. Also, there is nothing in theory which says 3% is ideal and 2.8% is not and 3.5% is not ideal, there is no basis for saying it.

I believe that in the Indian context, because of our young demography, our dependency ratio is low. This means there are more taxpayers than retired people. And this is going to remain like this for the next couple of decades, which means that if we have higher deficit spending today to induce growth — what Professor Bhanumurthy said about capital spending — tomorrow’s generation will have to pay it back in the form of taxes. But per capita tax burden on future generations is going to be relatively low or modest because we have the young demography advantage. So I think the bottom line is that there is an expectation that the Budget will do something about providing a fiscal stimulus but there will also be a challenge of remaining within the legislative remit. Also, the legislation itself gives the government some leeway of overshooting by 0.5% in times of rapid fall in GDP growth rate, which is what we are seeing.

Is there a downside to all this?

Ajit Ranade: The downside is that first of all we need to worry about sustainability... when you go into deficit spending, whether the debt that you take on additionally is sustainable. The young demography and medium-term growth prospects make it reasonably sustainable. And you also need to worry about whether international ratings agencies would react negatively to an extraordinary fiscal stimulus. That’s the balancing you would need to do. On that count I believe India’s ratings have improved, at least the outlook, and I don’t think it’s going to become negative simply because of a higher fiscal deficit this year. In any case you know the world today is awash with so much funds and negative interest rates in most of the developed world, so I don’t think the adverse impact of a rating action, which I think is very unlikely, and higher interest rates for India, including corporates, is a big risk.

Is it time to trigger the FRBM’s ‘escape clause’? And if so, what is the roadmap when the escape clause gets triggered?

N.R. Bhanumurthy: I think in terms of the escape clause, my guess is that we are actually ‘escaping’ every year. The way we are amending the FRBM Act regularly shows that we seem to have the escape clause within the mandate. The initial FRBM said you need to achieve 3% by 2018; now we are in 2020. That itself shows that the Act has some kind of flexibility. Now we don’t know what the 15th Finance Commission is going to recommend; they’re also supposed to come out with their own FRBM roadmap. I think when the Action Taken Report is placed in Parliament, we will know what the 15th Finance Commission is recommending. But in terms of this analytical issue, the 3% fiscal deficit target, what we are looking at is a general government fiscal deficit of 5.6-6% and that actually came from some of the studies done by Dr. Rangarajan as part of the 12th Finance Commission. And later for the 13th and 14th Finance Commission, we have done some work, where it is clearly evident that if you can bring down the revenue deficit to zero, that means if you are not borrowing for consumption purposes, that itself will bring down the general fiscal deficit to close to 6%. That is how this whole 3 plus 3 has been worked out.

Would a targeted TARP-like programme, which tries to give fiscal support to just the financial services sector, because it is such a key sector in terms of its multiplier impact, work?

Ajit Ranade: I absolutely feel that is so. It is true in general that capital spending is seen as more productive and better quality spending than consumer spending. But this year is so unusual that we also need to give a consumption stimulus, including in the form of PM-Kisan, enhanced spending for the MGNREGA, and so on. Growth today is constrained due to a collapse in credit. Bank credit growth has fallen steeply and ironically there is so much excess liquidity... in fact, on a daily basis the Reserve Bank of India finds that there is more than 3 lakh crore of excess liquidity. The reasons for the credit collapse is because of the NPA [non-performing assets] situation. NPAs are actually incrementally rising. Plus the lingering effects of the NBFC [Non-Banking Financial Company] crisis and the still relatively high real interest rates. So, I believe it is going to help if some kind of a credit enhancer, or anything that can release the credit flow which is required for growth, is done. There is some discussion about gathering all the NPAs... the toxic ones and into a bad bank. I am not sure a bad bank is appropriate but something like that needs to be done.

We need to give high priority for recapitalisation wherever necessary, identifying or isolating bad assets and let credit grow. For GDP to grow at 7-8%, we need credit to grow at 15-20% and that includes bank credit, NBFCs, ECBs [external commercial borrowings], everything.

Where would you suggest the whole thrust of the Budget’s emphasis on the FRBM and the fiscal deficit should be?

N.R. Bhanumurthy: Revisit the FRBM Act, revert to the original FRBM, try to focus more on the revenue deficit and at the same time try to increase capital expenditure. That alone will bring you more growth and fiscal discipline. I’ve been arguing that when you’re going to revise the FRBM Act, please come out with some kind of range target. Not just point targets of 3% you know you’re going to violate.

Ajit Ranade: I agree with Professor Bhanumurthy that we should not ignore the quality of spending and cost savings or cost efficiency wherever possible before we embark on fiscal stimulus in terms of increased spending. Secondly, remember fiscal deficit is equal to expenditure minus revenue. It’s got two aspects: expenditure and revenue. So let’s not forget the revenue sources for spending as well. For example, I would not let go of the capital gains tax. And the fact that the stock markets are at an all-time high I think negates the argument that LTCG [long-term capital gains] would be detrimental to the stock market. So, don’t let go of revenue sources you have.

The government has to acknowledge that this is a year when aggregate demand has really fallen and while we wait for consumption, investment spending from the private sector to come up, to revive, it falls on the government to stimulate. And I would say not just capital spending but you might have to look at providing a consumption stimulus especially to the lower incomes. Also, look at avenues to revive financial savings. This is a year where they have very little choice but to provide fiscal impetus and that means we will have to exceed the target and perhaps take refuge in some of the escape clauses. And also wait for the growth revival next year.

367,2020/01/24,As India prepares to honour Bolsonaro,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi often does the unexpected, the surprise sometimes being agreeable, at other times the reverse. His invitation to leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) at his inauguration in 2014 and hosting all the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders at the Republic Day in 2019 were in the first category; the demonetisation in the second. He has now produced another surprise by inviting Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to be his guest of honour for Republic Day 2020.

Mr. Bolsonaro, a pro-gun lobby, homophobic, far-right religious former Army Captain, came to power in 2018. The defining aspects of his administration have been a strong inclination towards the U.S. and damaging policies affecting the Amazon rainforest. In foreign policy, his affiliation with the U.S. is driven by admiration for President Donald Trump. Brazil has been designated a ‘major non-NATO ally’, a status held by close U.S. allies like Japan, Israel and South Korea. Mr. Bolsonaro has also followed Washington by relocating its Israel Embassy in Jerusalem, a city contested by Palestinians. On the Amazon delta, his policy has been to withdraw regulation and enforcement, facilitating the utilisation of the indigenous people’s land for the purposes of agri-business, mining and cattle-ranching. He has belittled climate activists like Leonardo DiCaprio and Greta Thunberg and compared indigenous communities living in previously protected areas to animals in zoos. Under his presidency, the number of black and indigenous people murdered has increased. His domestic approval rating stands at only 30%.

Imbalance within the bloc

Apart from Mr. Bolsonaro’s woeful record as President, a larger question pertains to the future of BRICS, the grouping of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. This was set up as a move towards greater multi-polarity; hence the spread across three continents and both hemispheres. The BRICS combination accounts for about one-third of global output, but a glance at the GDP table and growth rates will show the infirmities of the group: in terms of GDP, China occupies the second position; India the fifth; Brazil the ninth; Russia the 11th; and South Africa the 35th. In terms of growth rates, China grew at 6%; India at 4.5%, Russia 1.7%, Brazil 1.2% and South Africa 0.1%. Both politically and economically, Brazil and South Africa have been the laggards in recent years.

But, the leaders of the five nations still see purchase in keeping this group together. Each country has different economic and political leverage, and its own burden of domestic and external issues. But they all share the benefits of autonomous decision making and non-affiliation with any binding alliances and the group’s informal structure is an advantage for coordination among the most influential non-Western countries.

The BRICS summit in Brasilia last November was an exercise in diplomatic tightrope walking. Despite having made disparaging remarks about China in the past, Mr. Bolsonaro was aware that sharing a platform with the heads of China, Russia and India magnified his own significance both within and outside his country.

The BRICS group can survive only if its members maximise their congruences to the extent possible, despite the growing intensity of Sino-Russian ties; the pro-American leanings in Brazil; the socio-economic difficulties of South Africa after nine years under the controversial Jacob Zuma; and India’s many difficulties with China, including its abstention from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership.

Achievements of the grouping

The main achievement of BRICS is the New Development Bank, with each country contributing equally to its equity. The bank has so far financed over 40 projects at a cost of $12 billion. The BRICS countries are also developing a joint payments mechanism to reduce foreign trade settlements in U.S. dollars. An offshoot of the group, dealing with climate change, is BASIC (BRICS without Russia), which met at the Spain conference last month and reiterated its support to the Paris Agreement.

The closing statement of the last BRICS summit deftly steered clear of the pitfalls of clashing ideologies and interests, while containing many formulations of self-congratulation that officials in the Indian Ministry of External Affairs can produce in their sleep. It enumerated 30 statements and communiques as a result of two summit meetings, 16 ministers meetings, and others at various levels totaling 116 gatherings. Under the forthcoming Russian chairmanship, this number could exceed 150. India is taking the lead role in digital health, digital forensics, film technology, traditional medicine, sustainable water management, internships and fellowships.

Mr. Modi is evidently not concerned about Mr. Bolsonaro’s status as Washington’s most loyal follower in Latin America, and could justify his invitation to Mr. Bolsonaro with references to the enduring quality of BRICS, Brazil’s agreement to waive visa requirements for Indian citizens, and the potential for Brazilian investments in the sectors of space and defence, agricultural equipment, animal husbandry, post-harvest technologies, and bio-fuels. But the total two-way trade is at a paltry $8 billion, and the prospect of closer economic ties, however desirable, would require considerable optimism. Mr. Trump will be pleased by the Indian honour for his Brazilian alter ego; perhaps this was what mainly motivated Mr. Modi’s invitation.

368,2020/01/24,Needless impatience: On Centre’s plea on death row convicts,"The Centre’s application in the Supreme Court for additional guidelines regarding the execution of condemned prisoners betrays a needless impatience to hang the four convicts facing the gallows for the rape and murder of ‘Nirbhaya’ in 2012. The Ministry of Home Affairs essentially seeks the incorporation of measures aimed at reducing the scope for death row convicts to adopt dilatory tactics. Even though there may be some evidence to believe that convicts tend to file review petitions, mercy petitions and curative petitions in such a way that their execution is indefinitely delayed, it is difficult to attribute their conduct to the supposedly “accused-centric” nature of the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in Shatrughan Chauhan (2014). These guidelines were undoubtedly aimed at protecting the constitutional rights of prisoners in the context of a sound body of jurisprudence that maintains that such rights extend right up to the moment of their execution. The court was anxious about enforcing their right to be informed about the scope for filing petitions for clemency, for being given legal assistance in drafting them, and for exploring judicial remedies even after their appeals for mercy are rejected. Further, the 14-day time lag between the closure of the clemency route and their hanging is aimed at preventing secret executions. The court was concerned about the right of the convicts’ family members to be informed, as well as the time needed by the prisoners for settling their affairs and preparing themselves mentally.

Also Read A condemned man cannot fight death penalty endlessly: CJI

It is strange that the government wants the Supreme Court to frame a rule imposing a seven-day limit on the time that convicts have to file a mercy petition after a death warrant is issued. And that courts, governments and prison authorities should all be mandated to issue death warrants within seven days of the rejection of mercy petitions and to carry out the sentence within seven days thereafter. To believe that these are matters that contribute to substantive delay in carrying out death sentences is misconceived. Nothing prevents the government from introducing rules to address such situations. On the need for a time limit for filing curative petitions, the government is right in believing that the absence of such a stipulation gives scope for convicts in the same case to take turns to file such petitions. However, there is no sign that the apex court delays disposal of curative petitions. If and when one is filed, it results in no more than a few days’ delay. In a country that unfortunately retains the death penalty, there is no excuse for delaying the disposal of any petition, either in court, or before constitutional functionaries. Nor is there any need to expedite executions by revisiting sound guidelines. As the death penalty is limited to the “rarest of rare” cases, nothing is lost if those facing execution are allowed to exhaust all possible remedies.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/needless-impatience/article30636784.ece
369,2020/01/24,Unprecedented step: On Wuhan lockdown,"In a bid to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus that emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province in early December last year, China took a drastic and unprecedented step this week to shut down the city, thus preventing its 11 million inhabitants from leaving. All modes of transport have been suspended to prevent residents from exiting the city. Authorities also planned to suspend public transport services in Huanggang, a city of seven million; shut rail stations in Ezhou; and impose travel restrictions in Chibi. These moves come in the wake of an increasing number of people getting infected and even dying. As on January 23, the number of infected people in China stood at 571 and deaths at 17. Wuhan, the hotspot of the disease outbreak, has reported nearly 80% of all cases and all the 17 deaths. Further, the virus has spread to 24 provinces within the country and outside as well — cases have been reported in Thailand and Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, U.S., Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, and Singapore. That the virus has already acquired the ability to spread from one person to another has been confirmed by the World Health Organization. Apart from people in close contact with affected individuals, 16 health-care workers have been infected. The WHO now sees possible evidence of sustained transmission — the ability of the virus to spread beyond just clusters of patients.

The decision to enforce shutdowns came on a day when WHO’s Emergency Committee was deliberating on whether the coronavirus outbreak should be declared a “public health emergency of international concern”. With a split verdict and not enough information available to make a decision on Wednesday, the emergency committee reconvened on Thursday. The WHO Director-General took note of China’s decision and said that the travel ban is a reflection of the significant measures taken by China to minimise the spread of the virus. Even the chair of the committee said the travel ban is an “important information and will certainly be useful for the reflection of the members of the committee”. These observations run counter to the stand the WHO has always taken even when it announces public health emergency. While declaring the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as a public health emergency last year, the WHO had stated unequivocally that it is “essential to avoid the punitive economic consequences of travel and trade restrictions on affected communities”. That said, even if it limits the spread outside these cities, shutdowns cannot prevent human-to-human transmission within the cities. Shutting down entire cities go beyond the normal practice of quarantining infected people and might backfire.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unprecedented-step/article30636800.ece
370,2020/01/24,"In Bengaluru, Bescom seeks average ₹1.96/unit hike in tariff","Consumers serviced by the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) many have to brace for a shock as the power utility has sought a massive ₹1.96/unit hike in tariff for the coming financial year. Bescom has filed its tariff petition with the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC).

Last year, the commission had allowed a 33 paise per unit increase across all electricity supply companies (Escoms) against the different hikes that the five Escoms had sought ranging from ₹1 to ₹1.67 per unit.

Justifying the steep hike, Bescom officials cited a revenue deficit of ₹5,872.08 for the financial year 2020-21. “The ₹1.96 hike is not going to be a burden on all consumers. We are asking the government to make up for most of the deficit by increasing the subsidy for irrigation pump (IP) sets by ₹3,” explained an official.

According to the tariff petition, the existing tariff for IP sets is ₹3.90 per unit while the proposed tariff is ₹6.90.

Domestic consumers coming under Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), municipal corporations and urban local bodies will be impacted based on which slab of consumption they fall under.

According to the tariff document, domestic consumers with installations up to 1 KW will see a 9.03% increase in their monthly bill for the first 50 units – from ₹277 to ₹302. For consumption of 100 units, the increase will be 4.66% – from ₹537 to ₹562.

Those with 3 KW installations and higher consumption will see over 12% increase in their electricity bills under the proposed tariff. For consumption of 200 units, the bill will shoot up from ₹1,352 to ₹1,527 due to a 12.94% increase.

For 300 units, the bill will increase by 12.90% from ₹2,132 to ₹2,407, and for 400 units, from ₹2,912 to ₹3,287 due to a 12.88% increase.

Fixed charge hike

What has riled consumers further is the hike sought in fixed charges per month from ₹60 to ₹85 for the first KW, and from ₹70 to ₹95 for additional KW.

Y.G. Muralidharan from Consumer Rights Education and Awareness Trust (CREAT) said Bescom has only been increasing tariff without improving its services. “The fixed cost hike definitely has to be opposed. There has been no improvement in infrastructure. They should be nothing more than the power purchase cost, and they are asking for too much this time,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/jp7qor/article30646741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24bgBescomcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bescom-seeks-average-196unit-hike-in-tariff/article30646742.ece
371,2020/01/24,BWSSB engineers booked for letting sewage into Chunchaghatta lake,"The police on Thursday filed an FIR against two engineers of the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) for allegedly allowing sewage into Chunchaghatta lake in J.P. Nagar, 7th Phase.

Based on a complaint by Lingegowda, assistant executive engineer of the Lake Development Authority, the Konanakunte police have filed an FIR against BWSSB engineer Raghavendra and assistant engineer Ramesh. They have been booked under Section 277 (fouling water of public spring or reservoir).

Lingegowda, in charge of lake maintenance, said that the department had revived the lake in 2018. “However, recently the water started turning foul. When we inspected it, we found that sewage from the adjacent area was being let directly into the lake,” he told the police.

He claimed to have brought it to the notice of the accused and even held a joint inspection to rectify the problem in January. Though the officials assured him of taking up corrective measures, sewage continued to flow into the lake causing further damage to flora and fauna, he told the police.

The police said that they will call the engineers for questioning, based on which necessary action will be taken.

V. Ramprasad, co-founder and convenor of Friends of Lakes, told The Hindu that, along with BWSSB, even Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) should be held responsible as it is the regulatory body.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bwssb-engineers-booked-for-letting-sewage-into-chunchaghatta-lake/article30646292.ece
372,2020/01/24,"Apartments, KSPCB spar over STP compliance","The Bangalore Apartments’ Federation (BAF), which has around 550 member apartment complexes, has accused the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) of ‘harassing’ them over setting up Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs).

The BAF claims that the board has started issuing notices to apartments by ‘creating reports’ of non-compliance despite them installing STPs and testing treated water samples on a monthly basis.

In a statement issued on Friday, H. A. Nagaraja Rao, president, BAF, said, “KSPCB claims that the notices were sent based on treated water samples they had collected many months ago. They have then purportedly created reports, which state that the sample is not compliant with prevailing norms. We are wondering how these reports came to be when samples themselves were not collected in quite a few cases.”

Water treatment expert Ananth Kodavasal lent his support to the BAF’s claims. “The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has come down heavily on State agencies like BWSSB, KSPCB and BBMP for their incompetence and have directed them to set things right. However, instead of going after the real polluters, like BWSSB and industries, KSPCB is resorting to harassing innocent and law-abiding apartment residents with a view to showing to NGT that they are taking action.”

KSPCB denies allegations

The KSPCB denied the allegations. Basavaraj V. Patil, Member Secretary, KSPCB told The Hindu that notices are being sent only where non-compliance is noticed and establishments are being given time to become compliant.

“Apartment with more than 20 flats and commercial establishments of over 5000 sq. mt. have to have STPs. We have sent 268 notices to establishments (not apartments alone) in Bengaluru for non-compliance. They are given 15 days to comply. Of these, 97 complied,” he said.

Mr. Patil further said that there are parameters for compliance, which need to be followed, and failing those standards is not considered as “treatment”.

“Apartment premises should be reusing this treated water for car washing, toilet flushing, gardening. But in many places, an STP has not been set up and where there is STP, the sewage is not being treated or not within parameters. As per our rules and the NGT, we have to take action. We have noticed violations, such as letting out sewage into open drains. KSPCB is not here to create trouble. Let them approach the board. We will support compliance,” he added.

BAF has warned of legal action against the KSPCB.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/apartments-kspcb-spar-over-stp-compliance/article30646149.ece
373,2020/01/24,Bengaluru gets its own swachhata anthem,"The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), on Friday, released an anthem to create awareness about Swachh Survekshan 2020. It has been composed and sung by Lucky Ali, who is a long-time resident of the city.

While releasing the anthem, titled Jotheyagi, Mayor M. Goutham Kumar urged citizens to join hands with the civic body in keeping the city clean by segregating waste and not using single-use plastic or disposable items.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said Mr. Ali had produced the anthem at no cost to the city. “Many cities that are participating in Swachh Survekshan, such as Indore and Mysuru, have their own anthems. They are released each year based on the theme of the survekshan,” he said.

Bengaluru’s anthem has a mix of Kannada and English lyrics, and showcases citizens from all walks of life, including pourakarmikas and students. It also features artistes Vasu Dixit and Archana Udupa. The message of keeping the city clean is communicated in a simple and direct manner.

Mr. Anil Kumar said the civic body had taken several initiatives to secure a better ranking under Swachh Survekshan 2020. “In just two months, we have cleared over 200 black spots. Several flyovers and underpasses have been beautified,” he said, and added that these initiatives would be sustained through the year.

Speaking to reporters after the anthem was released, Mr. Ali said that having lived in Bengaluru for more than 50 years, he was witness to the changes in the city. “The song is for our city, which will hopefully inspire youngsters to keep their surroundings clean. I hope to see a great change in the management of waste, which is not just the responsibility of the BBMP, but also of the citizens,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-gets-its-own-swachhata-anthem/article30645757.ece
374,2020/01/24,"In a first, pourakarmikas to be part of Republic Day parade","For the first time, a group of pourakarmikas will be part of the Republic Day celebrations on Sunday with the objective of creating awareness among citizens about proper waste management. They will march holding placards with messages such as ‘Namma Bengaluru Swachha Bengaluru’ and ‘Plastic Vyagisi Parisara Ulisi’.

The team of 30 pourakarmikas, most of whom are from the East zone, is called 'Swachhata Yodharu' (Cleanliness Warriors), and will be among 44 teams participating in the parade.

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said it was a proud moment for the civic body. “The 18,000 pourakarmikas of the BBMP bear the onerous responsibility of keeping the city clean. Their work is most important. They deserve to be recognised for the hard work that they put in,” he said. He expressed hope that with their inclusion in the parade, citizens will treat them with dignity and respect.

The move to include pourakarmikas in the parade has been hailed by netizens.

In response to Mr. Anil Kumar's tweet, Vinoo Thimmaya (@vinoothimmaya) tweeted: 'Recognition at grassroot level. Truly appreciate BBMP here'

A Common Man (@SainjeloJ) tweeted: 'Very good. Awesome to have them in the parade a true recognition for their efforts. I will be personally cheering for them'.

This recognition for the pourakarmikas, however, comes after a long struggle. Until the BBMP introduced the biometric attendance system, pourakarmikas had to stage protests to ensure that their salaries were disbursed.

They also struggled to get out of the clutches of garbage contractors. As a result of their struggle, the 18,000 pourakarmikas are now directly employed by the civic body and salaries are disbursed directly to their bank accounts by the 7th of every month.

The BBMP continues to work for the welfare of the civic workers, Mr. Anil Kumar said. “The pourakarmikas claimed that the gloves were hard and cumbersome while the masks made breathing difficult. We have now redesigned the gloves and masks to make them lightweight and washable. These will be distributed to all civic workers. It is already mandatory for them to use protective gear,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/3x2yme/article30645670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGREPUBLICDAYPOURAKARMIKAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/in-a-first-pourakarmikas-to-be-part-of-republic-day-parade/article30645671.ece

Among the 44 teams that will take part in the march past is one of pourakarmikas. Most of the 30 members in the group are from the East zone, and are called ‘Swachcha Yodharu’. It’s their debut at the parade, and their theme is creating awareness among citizens about proper waste management, especially keeping our city environment clean.

Speaking to reporters on Friday, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said Governor V.R. Vala is set to arrive at the grounds at 8.58 a.m., following which the national flag will be hoisted and march past taken out.

Apart from the team of pourakarmikas, the other teams in the march past will include Karnataka and Kerala police personnel, Scouts and Guides, National Cadet Corps, Seva Dal and children from different schools in the city. In all, a total of 1,750 people will be part of the parade.

As many as 2,000 children will present three cultural programmes on the occasion. ‘The Tornados’ – a motorcycle display team of the Indian Army Service Corps – will also be performing.

With regard to security arrangement, Mr. Kumar said as many as 85 CCTV cameras will be installed across the parade grounds. Ambulances, fire tenders and medical teams will be on stand-by in case of any emergencies.

According to a press release, a total of nine Deputy Commissioners of Police, 150 senior police officials and over 940 junior police personnel will be posted for bandobast duty. That apart, 10 Karnataka State Reserve Police platoons, 2 District Armed Reserve Police, 1 platoon of the Rapid Action Force will also be in place.

There will be 10,000 seats in total, including 2,000 for VVIPs. Separate entrance and exit arrangements are also in place. VVIPs have to use Gate 2, while Gate 1 will be used by defence personnel, freedom fighters and VIPs. State government officials, retired officials and BSF personnel, for whom 2,000 seats have been reserved, should use Gate 3.

Those attending are prohibited from carrying cigarettes, matchboxes/ lighters, pamphlets, coloured powders, video and still cameras, water bottles, sharp objects, black coloured cloth/ clothes, food items, liquor, crackers and explosive materials.

Parking facilities

Those who have Yellow parking pass will have to reach Gate 1 of Manekshaw Parade Grounds via Cubbon Road, while those having White parking pass will have to enter the grounds through Gate 2 via Cubbon Road.

Pink pass holders should park their vehicles opposite Army Public School, Kamaraj Road, and walk up to the grounds and enter through Gate 3.

376,2020/01/24,Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike looks up to Mumbai,"The track record of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) in property tax collection isn’t the best as it is yet to achieve it targets, but it is hoping to address this issue by taking a leaf out of Mumbai’s book.

Recently, a team from the BBMP, including Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar, Mayor M. Goutham Kumar, Ruling Party Leader K. Muneendra Kumar, and Opposition Leader Abdul Wajid visited Mumbai to interact with officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

Mr. Goutham Kumar tweeted: “Our visit of Mumbai was a great learning experience for all of us. Some great insight from @mybmc officials and Mayor Smt. @KishoriPednekar on trade licence, disaster management, town planning and GIS-based property management system.”

Civic chief Mr. Anil Kumar told The Hindu that the Mumbai corporation has a very good system of property tax. “There, the property tax is linked with health licence (trade licence), Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), and registration under Shops and Commercial Establishments Act. This means that there is very little chance for any building to escape the tax net,” he explained.

Not all of the 20 lakh properties in Bengaluru are covered under the tax net. The BBMP, until January 15, had collected ₹2,425 crore, as against the target of ₹3,500 crore.

Mr. Anil Kumar added that officials also discussed Ease of Doing Business, under which sanction of construction permits, had already been implemented by the Mumbai corporation. “We are also exploring the options to simplify the processes involved in sanctioning building plans, according permits,” he added.

Meanwhile, the BBMP has made a list of top tax defaulters in each of the eight zones in the city. According to officials, the top 10 defaulters of East zone owe ₹2.27 crore to the civic body while those in West zone owe ₹2.09 crore. The dues from the top 10 in South zone amounts to ₹3.64 crore while it is ₹5.42 crore in Mahadevapura, ₹1.41 crore in Yelahanka, ₹1.29 crore in Bommanahalli, ₹3.09 crore in Dasarahalli and a whopping ₹18.97 crore in Rajarajeshwarinagar zone.

The BBMP has reportedly issued two to three demand notices to the defaulters. “We will issue the final demand notice. If they fail to pay even after the final demand notice, the movable properties will be seized, as per provisions of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976,” said a senior civic official.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/rplv6w/article30636794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23bgTax-Kitty-newcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bruhat-bengaluru-mahanagara-palike-looks-up-to-mumbai/article30640470.ece

378,2020/01/24,Rain Centre to support rainwater harvesting initiatives in Chennai’s government-aided institutions,"In a bid to help more institutions sustain their source of groundwater, the Rain Centre is now focussing on harnessing rainwater in government aided educational institutions to make self-reliant for their water needs.

The Centre, a city-based voluntary organisation dedicated to creating awareness on rainwater harvesting (RWH), found that several charitable organisations depended on groundwater for their daily requirements but did not have funds to harvest rainwater through recharge wells.

Over the past five years, the Centre has helped nearly 41 charitable organisations and schools, including Lady Sivasamy School, in and around the city, to harvest rainwater falling on their rooftops as well as surface run-off. The initiative is being supported by corporate social responsibility funds.

The Centre's director Sekar Raghavan said, “We started supporting government-aided educational institutions who postpone RWH measures for lack of funds and under daily management pressures.”

The latest among the institutions the Centre is helping are SDNB Vaishnav College, Chromepet and Ethiraj College where recharge wells are being built in their large campus. These institutions mainly depend on groundwater and sometimes need to buy from tankers to bridge the gap in water needs.

“We are building 25 recharge wells in Ethiraj College to make them self-sufficient in water requirements. At present, they depend on groundwater and draw water from 3-4 borewells to supply the college and three hostels,” said Mr.Raghavan.

Once the project to provide recharge wells and interconnect them with rainwater collected on the rooftop and surface run-off is completed, the groundwater table is expected to increase by two or three metres in the college premises. The aim is to conserve rainwater and not let a drop of rainwater on to the road or sewer network.

The Centre will soon start work at Sankara Nethralaya, St. Thomas Mount too. The groundwater table will be monitored in these organisations.

The institutions are chosen based on a few criteria, including large campuses and those relying on groundwater. A display board will also be put up specifying details on the quantity of water harnessed, he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mey4ay/article30643007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24JANTH-RWH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rain-centre-to-support-rainwater-harvesting-initiatives-in-chennais-government-aided-institutions/article30641991.ece
379,2020/01/24,Periyar statue vandalised in Kancheepuram district,"Tension prevailed in Kaliyapettai in Kancheepuram district after a statue of social reformer Periyar was vandalised by miscreants.

The statue was installed by local residents 20 years ago, and was inaugurated by leaders of the Dravidar Kazhagam. The face and a hand of the statue were damaged. The damaged portions were subsequently covered with white cloth. Security was beefed up after the incident.

DMK and VCK cadre in the area staged protests demanding the arrest of the culprits. A complaint was lodged with the Salavakkam police. Senior police officers visited the spot and conducted a preliminary inquiry.

Director General of Police J.K. Tripathy warned that strong action would be taken against anti-social elements who vandalise statues of Periyar or other leaders.

Villagers suspect that fans of actor Rajinikanth may have vandalised the statue, in an apparent backlash to protests by Periyarist outfits against the actor over his remarks about an anti-superstition rally organised by Periyar in Salem in 1971.

Defacement condemned

Opposition parties have condemned the defacement of the statue.

DMK president M.K. Stalin said the incident was condemnable and shameful. “These kinds of incidents still persist. The Tamil Nadu government should take appropriate action against those who vandalised Periyar’s statue,” he said.

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said Periyar was a leader of the nation. “He was instrumental in facilitating the development of backward and downtrodden communities. It is unfortunate that his statue was broken. The TNCC condemns it,” he said.

CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan alleged that communal forces were behind the incident. “Insulting him, breaking his statue, turning him into a topic of debate and these continuing activities are being carried out by communal forces. Those who believe that Periyar’s thoughts are a threat to their communal agenda are the ones who are indulging in these activities. If this continues, secular forces will take them head-on,” he said.

“Under this government, Periyar statues have been vandalised continuously. The police have been passive in finding the miscreants and bringing them to book. The Tamil Nadu government should change this and ensure the arrest of those responsible,” said MDMK leader Vaiko.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ktm2je/article30641722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24JANTH-Periyarjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/periyar-statue-vandalised-in-kancheepuram-district/article30641723.ece
380,2020/01/24,"Law College principal arrested for faking attendance records, attempting to cheat Bar Council","The Central Crime Branch (CCB) has arrested a principal of a law college in Cuddapah, Andhra Pradesh for allegedly creating fake attendance records and giving bonafide certificates to several law students in a fraudulent manner, in order for them to enrol as lawyers with the Tamil Nadu Bar Council.

The suspect has been identified as Himavantha Kumar, 54, principal of Smt. Basava Rama Tarakam Memorial Law College, Cuddapah. He was said to have created attendance records showing that that students had the necessary attendance, even though they didn’t attend regular classes.

The Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (BCTNP) had lodged a police complaint against a law graduate, an advocate and another individual for attempting to influence its members and for collecting bribes by misusing their name, in order to get a graduate enrolled as an advocate in the Council.

According to the complaint, the application of B. Vipin, 59, of Villivakkam in Chennai was rejected by the council since he had apparently done his law degree between 2015-18 while serving in the Southern Railway as a guard.

The applicant did not relent and instead appeared to have paid a bribe of ₹25,000 to a lawyer and his accomplice who had promised to get him enrolled by exercising their influence with Bar Council members. Police arrested three people, including Vipin. The case was transferred to CCB for further investigations.

Following an investigation, the CCB found that Vipin had a certificate from the principal showing him he had 80% attendance in law college though Vipin was working with Southern Railway at the time.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/e3qnpi/article30640913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24JANTH--ARREST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/law-college-principal-arrested-for-faking-attendance-records-attempting-to-cheat-bar-council/article30640914.ece
381,2020/01/24,Blind craze for male baby led a woman to kidnap,"The discriminatory practice of ‘son preference’ seems to have been behind the recent kidnapping of boy only a few months old in the city.

The suspect Revathi, 24, had given birth to three girl children, of which two died and only one girl survived. Driven by the desire to have a boy, she reversed her sterilisation and conceived recently. Her husband and in laws made it clear they wanted only a boy.

Police said she returned to maternal home and there, along with her mother hatched a plan to abort her foetus and buy a boy baby. She aborted her baby, but went around with a padded ‘baby bump’. She was walking on the beach on January 12, when she spotted the boy baby of a couple selling balloons there. Offering to get the baby a chance to act in films, she took the mother and grandmother, along with the baby in an auto to Spencer Plaza, the Government Multi Specialty Hospital and later to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital under pretext of doing a ‘skin test’. Having them waiting outside, she vanished with the child.

She went with the child to the Government Children’s Hospital and her mother Jayalakshmi joined them. “The child could not drink milk from the bottle as he was used to being breast fed. Revathi tried to admit the child on the grounds of ill-health. The staff in the hospital did not admit him, treating him as an out patient. But the duo continued to remain in the hospital, staying put in the corridor. Revathi’s husband’s family also visited her and believed that the child was born to her. As the police were on the look out for her, she did not step out from the hospital. One of the nurses who became suspicious, questioned her. They attempted to escape then”, said a senior police officer.

On January 21 evening, police team searching for the child reached the hospital and rescued the child from them. The child was reunited with his parents. City Police Commissioner A.K.Viswanathan appreciated the entire team including police personnel and hospital staff for rescuing the child.

Revathi and her mother Jayalakshmi were arrested and remanded to judicial custody.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/blind-craze-for-male-baby-led-a-woman-to-kidnap/article30638152.ece
382,2020/01/24,When residents turn violators,"While electricity officials are looking at improving the safety of residents, there are localities in North Chennai where safety norms have been thrown to the wind by those who illegally use power infrastructure.

In places like Sowcarpet, Mint, Parry’s, Park Town, Seven Wells, Elephant Gate, Mannady and George Town, transformers and junction boxes are occupied by homeless people.

In areas around Second Line Beach Road, Errabalu Street, Mooker Nalla Muthu Street, Linghi Chetty Street, Armenian Street, Audiappa Naicken Street, and a section of NSC Bose Road, the transformers, which are supposed to be avoided by the public for safety reasons, are misused as parking spaces for vehicles, dumping of garbage and also as living spaces.

A senior Tangedco official said along several streets in the commercial district, where space comes at a premium, transformers are being illegally occupied by residents, commercial establishments and petty shops. The illegal encroachment by the homeless people causes severe hardship to maintenance officials looking to undertake repairs in case of a fault.

The official said several homeless people who are unaware of the risks have converted the space below transformers into homes for several years. Though the people are regularly evicted, they keep coming back within days, he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/when-residents-turn-violators/article30638109.ece
383,2020/01/24,Activists initiate campaign against board examinations for classes 5 and 8,"While the first batch of students from classes 5 and 8 is preparing to write public exams in March and April, the opposition to the conduct of the exams is continuing to grow.

Child rights activists and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have now initiated a campaign to urge the State government to roll back the decision to conduct public exams for students of classes 5 and 8.

“This exam will topple any developmental action that has happened with regard to children and education in the State for the last few decades. At present, our enrolment rates are high. We fear that these exams will only reduce this momentum and lead to more dropouts,” said Andrew Sesuraj, Convenor of Tamil Nadu Child Rights Watch.

As a first step, Mr. Andrew said that they plan to consult with stakeholders including parents, teachers and students before meeting the education minister as well as other officials. While the Education Department has maintained that these exams are being conducted to assess the learning levels and how well children have imbibed the basics, Mr. Andrew said that using exams as a tool to assess them at such a young age would be detrimental to their development. “There are better methods for teachers to derive an assessment in the classroom and everything should not be exam-oriented,” he said.

Activists are also hoping to spread awareness on social media. A few months ago, members of the Confederation of Arunodhaya Children Sangam had submitted a representation to the Chief Minister’s cell, appealing against conduct of the public exams. “The response we got from the cell stated that Tamil Nadu is conducting the exams owing to the amendment in the RTE Act. There is however nothing in the amendment about a public exam,” said Virgil D’Sami, executive director, Arunodhaya Centre.

Ms. Virgil said that despite the State having said that there will not be any students detained for the first three years, there might be a negative impact if children do not perform well. “We’ve seen several children from underprivileged backgrounds blossom and do well academically after they reach high school. If they fail in either the class 5 or 8 public exams and their parents are not keen on them continuing their education, they might have to drop out,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/activists-initiate-campaign-against-board-examinations-for-classes-5-and-8/article30638103.ece
384,2020/01/24,Nadigar Sangam cases: HC to deliver verdict today,"The Madras High Court is all set to deliver orders on Friday in a batch of cases which would decide the validity of elections held for South Indian Artists Association (SIAA), popularly known as Nadigar Sangam, on June 23 and pave the way for the counting of votes that remain confined to the ballot boxes for more than six months.

Justice K. Kalyanasundaram would also be delivering orders on another set of cases filed against a Government Order appointing a Special Officer for managing SIAA since the three-year tenure of the last office-bearers including actors Vishal, Nasser and Karthi had come to an end on October 18, 2018 as they had got elected in 2015.

The Registrar of Societies had on June 19 passed an order against conduct of elections to the association. However, Justice P.D. Audikesavalu had stayed the Registrar’s order on June 21 and permitted the association to conduct the elections with a rider that the results should not be declared until the disposal of the cases before the court.

Thereafter, Justice N. Anand Venkatesh held a special sitting at his Besant Nagar residence on June 22 (a Saturday) and ordered police protection for the election. The orders obtained during the eleventh hour led to many members including actor Rajinikanth complain that he did not receive the postal ballot on time and was therefore unable to cast his vote.

After all these interim orders, cases relating to conduct of elections as well as the appointment of special officer were clubbed together and listed for final hearing before Justice Kalyanasundaram who reserved his verdict in November last.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nadigar-sangam-cases-hc-to-deliver-verdict-today/article30638071.ece
385,2020/01/24,Bypoll bribery case: EC throws ball in I-T dept’s court,"The Election Commission (EC) on Thursday told the Madras High Court that any further proceeding in the 2017 Radhakrishnan Nagar bypoll bribery case would now depend upon the assessment proceedings initiated by the Income Tax department against Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar from whose residence the I-T sleuths had reportedly recovered a loose sheet of paper regarding distribution of money.

Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha, EC’s counsel Niranjan Rajagopalan said, “The Election Commission feels that now everything is under the realm of the tax authorities.” On his part, A.P. Srinivas, Senior Standing Counsel for the I-T department, said, the officials had now got one more year’s time to complete the assessment proceedings initiated based on the seizures.

Explaining the issue in detail, he said, the I-T sleuths had seized several documents during the search conducted at the Minister’s residence as well as other related premises in April 2017 and it was based on those seizures, the EC had rescinded the bypoll notification and also lodged a police complaint. After the seizures, the department initiated search assessment proceedings against Mr. Vijayabaskar for eight different financial years.

Initially, the final assessment orders in those proceedings had to be passed on or before December 31, 2019 and the department, in fact, passed the orders with respect to four financial years. However, before the assessment orders could be passed for the rest of the four years, the Minister approached the I-T Settlement Commission and attempted to settle the issue. The Commission, on January 9 this year, rejected his plea at the admission stage itself.

As per law, the department now gets one more year, from the date of such rejection, to complete the assessment proceedings, the counsel said. Taking strong objection to such submissions, senior counsel P. Wilson, representing DMK candidate N. Maruthu Ganesh in the 2017 bypoll, said, “all is not well in this case since one authority is passing the buck to the other and the second authority is not coming up with any concrete submission.”

Recalling that the police complaint lodged at the instance of the EC in 2017 had got quashed by a single judge of the High Court in 2018 due to “collusion” between the local police and the accused, he wondered, “Why has the Election Commission not given a fresh complaint so far? What has the Settlement Commission to do with this case? That is exactly why we have knocked at the doors of this court and sought for a CBI probe.”

On his part, Advocate General Vijay Narayan, representing the police, objected to the plea for CBI probe and said, technically such a probe could not be ordered since the original complaint had culminated into registration of a First Information Report which was quashed by the High Court. No one had taken that order of the single judge on appeal to the Supreme Court and therefore nothing survives in the issue as on date, he said.

After hearing all of them, the judges reserved their orders on a petition filed by Mr. Ganesh seeking the leave of the court to amend the prayer in his writ petition and seek larger reliefs such as a CBI inquiry into the issue, fixing accountability on the EC for its commissions and ommissions and compensating him for expenses incurred during the campaign for the bypoll whose notification was rescinded after complaints of large-scale bribing of voters.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bypoll-bribery-case-ec-throws-ball-in-i-t-depts-court/article30638051.ece
386,2020/01/24,Traffic police to get more recovery vehicles,"While Chennai traffic police is set to get 50 more recovery vehicles to tow away haphazardly parked vehicles, the force continues to reel under a manpower shortage.

Illegal and obstructive parking has been a perennial problem in the city and is on the rise.

During a special drive conducted by the traffic police recently, a total of 4,000 vehicles were seized and challans issued.

However with 71 old recovery vehicles, 53 for four-wheelers and the remaining for two-wheelers, the traffic police has been finding it hard to remove cars, two-wheelers and autorickshaws quickly. “The hydraulic lifting does not work properly in most of them. In many it is very slow,” said a traffic constable. The police have written to the government seeking 50 more recovery vehicles. “We will be getting them soon and we will use 25 for two-wheelers and 25 for cars,” said a police source.

Hands full

However, the policemen complained of a shortage of manpower. “We are not getting the helping charges, ₹10 per vehicle, that we give to the youngsters who help tow the vehicles. Hence, in many stations a lone policeman drives the recovery van, puts the clamp on illegally parked vehicles and tows them away,” said an officer.

“We receive a minimum of 10 calls per day pertaining to illegal parking and most of them are from senior citizens,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/y1pujz/article30638024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THPOLICERECOVERYVEHICLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/traffic-police-to-get-more-recovery-vehicles/article30638025.ece
387,2020/01/24,Spate of accidents dent Tangedco’s safety record,"The new year began on a sour note for the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco), after four electrocution deaths were reported in the space of a week in the city.

The fatal accidents involving two wiremen in Sowcarpet and two persons in Choolaimedu and Tambaram have left senior officials in the electricity department worried. The two wiremen — R. Vincent, 43, and R. Udhaya Kumar, 40 — attached to the Sowcarpet East section office,were electrocuted when they were attempting to restore power supply to Audiappa Naicken Street, on January 1. Three days after this accident, Lima Rose, a resident of Choolaimedu, was killed when a pillar box burst due to a short-circuit in the underground cable on January 4. Senthil Kumar, a resident of Tambaram, was allegedly electrocuted when he stepped on a live wire near Selaiyur on January 3. However, local officials claimed it was not a case of electrocution.

Similar incidents have taken place in the past too. Sethu, a resident of Chitlapakkam, was electrocuted outside his house after an electricity pole collapsed on September 16 last year and a couple, Karunakaran and Sudha, were electrocuted in Velachery on November 22, 2015.

Taken by surprise

Power managers are surprised by the accidents which occurred within a week of issuing circulars to all officials, including superintending engineers, executive engineers and assistant executive engineers, to ensure an accident-free New Year. A senior official of Tangedco, sharing data of fatal accidents involving public and department officials for three years, said 114 persons were killed in 2019-20 against 108 fatalities for 2018-19. In 2017-18, the total deaths was 147.

Another Tangedco official said that a circular pertaining to preventive maintenance instructions was issued on December 24 last year listing out the various precautions to be taken, including covering of exposed underground cables, replacement of weak joints, installing new poles and tightening of sagging overhead power cables, to avoid accidents. The senior officials were given clear instructions to conduct regular safety awareness classes for maintenance staff to avoid loss of life among the staff and public, he added.

While in the case of the deaths of two wiremen human error has been cited, the local officials in Choolaimedu are yet to find answers for the bursting of the pillar box which resulted in the death of Lima Rose.

The official said that as per the preliminary report, the two wiremen were killed after they reportedly failed to fix earth rods in the two supply points of the transformer and wrongly closed a high tension supply network. The report has also identified lapses on the part of the supervisory staff to ensure mandatory safety measures were followed, he added.

‘Follow-up lacking’

S. Manoharan, retired safety officer of Tangedco, citing an average of three electrical fatalities involving both the public and workers per day in the State, faulted senior officials for not taking proper follow-up action to avert accidents. He said at a time when the distribution system had become quite complicated, with double- and triple-feeding from one single junction, the maintenance staff needed to be extra careful while taking up fault rectification.

Mr. Manoharan said during his tenure as a safety officer, a study was conducted based on 500 fatal electrical accidents and in the report submitted it was suggested that multiple distribution networks be marked with red paint for maintenance staff to easily identify and take extra care in such cases. He suggested that a special safety wing like the enforcement wing be created. Accidents needed to be properly analysed by senior officials of the rank of superintending engineers to find out what exactly happened and not become an exercise to apportion blame.

M. Somasundaram, officer-bearer of the Consumer Association of India, said officials of Tangedco needed to focus more on safety measures by closing exposed cables and pasting ‘danger’ stickers on transformers, junction boxes and pillar boxes, to prevent the public from standing near them. The consumer activist said that Tangedco's complaint no. 9445850829 needed to be publicised widely.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fqv6mz/article30638007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24City-transformercol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/spate-of-accidents-dent-tangedcos-safety-record/article30638008.ece
388,2020/01/24,Stretch of GST Road to be widened,"Work to widen one side of the Chennai-Tiruchi Highway (NH 32), known as the GST Road, for a distance of 5 km between Urapakkam and Guduvanchery beyond Tambaram, will commence soon.

A total of 18 km of the road, formerly known as NH45, is being widened from the present 4 lanes to 8 lanes, between Vandalur and Paranur. Widening of the road has become imperative due to heavy traffic and accidents.

Sources in the State Highways Department, which is carrying out the widening work with funds from NHAI, explained that at present, construction of stormwater drains was being undertaken on one side of the road.

Work on this stretch, being carried out beyond the service lane, will cost ₹40 crore. It is likely to take around six months for completion.

The 2.3-km-long stretch between Irumbuliyur and Vandalur has already been widened, at a cost of ₹20 crore. As far as the stretch beyond Guduvanchery is concerned, the 14-km-long stretch will cost ₹200 crore, and the Highways was waiting for administrative sanction for the work.

M. Jai Ganesh of The I Bakery at Guduvanchery, said the widening would help reduce congestion on the road that connects Chennai to Chengalpattu, Ulundurpet, Tiruchi and other places down south.

A section of residents had raised objections to the widening, saying that some were being favoured. However, Highways officials said that the measuring and marking was being done by the Revenue Department.

“The District Collector too had visited the spot and verified the correctness of the work. We cannot be partial to anyone.

392,2020/01/24,‘Ethics and meditation are indispensable’,"Individuals must understand their needs and revert to being users of resources, from being consumers, to put an end to conflicts caused by modernity.

This was one of the points that emerged at a panel discussion on “Ethics, Meditation and Wisdom in a Turbulent World”, organised by the Maithrim Poshas Trust, at Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan on Thursday.

Samdhong Rinpoche, Tibetan Buddhist scholar and founder of Maithrim Poshas Trust, said ethics and meditation, that calms the mind and awakens inner wisdom, were indispensable, and helped solve problems of the turbulent world. He said the increase in violence to sustain a market for weapons; climate change and pollution; economic disparity and civilisational conflicts were some of the threats.

Instead of cooperation, competition was being promoted as an inherent right of individuals, in this era of science and technology, he said. Individuals must limit their consumption to their needs and change must begin from the self, he added.

Actor Madhu Balaji said that Chocolate Krishna (Fresh Innings) was back due to public demand.

“We got hundreds of emails from fans, asking that we continue to stage the play. Ravishankar has practised the dialogues, studied Mohan’s body language and watched videos of the play,” he said.

The play was created in 2008, after Crazy Mohan wanted to write something for children, with humour and stuff, including magic, chocolate and Lord Krishna, that they love.

Director S.B. Khanthan said the troupe was planning to go to the U.S. to perform at the first Crazy Mohan Drama Anniversary Festival.

“We have had more plays because he is blessing us. Ravishankar obviously cannot match Mohan. But his lines will make anyone laugh. They are immortal, it does not matter who delivers them. I went to the rehearsal last week to direct Ravi, but instead, I just happily watched the play and laughed,” Mr. Khanthan said.

Their 1009th show is on Friday for Karthik Fine Arts. This will be followed by three shows on Saturday (7 p.m.) and Sunday (4 p.m. and 7 p.m.), all at the Narada Gana Sabha.

395,2020/01/24,M-sand units come under the scanner,"The Public Works Department is considering severe action against m-sand manufacturers who are yet to get approval for quality of material.

With the availability of river sand becoming limited, more consumers are turning to m-sand in the State. It is emerging as an alternative to river sand, and contributes to nearly 70-80% of the supply, according to sources in the PWD.

Of the seven river sand quarries approved in the State, only four are being operated.

Moreover, there is not enough demand for imported sand from Malaysia, as transportation cost from Chennai would be expensive, sources said.

Though the number of m-sand manufacturing units have proliferated in the past few years, complaints about the sale of substandard quality of sand continues in several places. In a bid to curb the production of poor quality sand, PWD had asked the manufacturers to register themselves for approval.

Bridging the gap

The State has a demand for about 32,000 truckloads of sand. At present, m-sand is bridging the gap in the shortage of river sand, and nearly 28,000 truckloads of m-sand are being supplied.

So far, PWD’s assessment committee has certified 216 m-sand manufacturing units for the quality of material produced. Consumers may check about units that have certification of quality for m-sand at their respective district collectorates.

Manufacturing units must apply for quality approval to the PWD within 30 days of operation, officials said. The Department had insisted that m-sand be sold only after certification is obtained from the PWD committee. It had announced a few weeks ago that action would be initiated against those who manufacture m-sand without quality approval.

However, it has received only 70 fresh applications from m-sand manufacturing units across the State, and they are being processed for certification. PWD is considering measures to take severe action against those operating without certification.

There are nearly 1,000 m-sand manufacturing units across the State. M-sand is being sold for an average price of ₹35 per cubic foot. It is sold for a cheaper price in places such as Karur (₹28/cft), where there are more units. However, in places like Chennai, it is priced up to ₹42 per cft.

The m-sand policy, which aims to promote sales of m-sand, and put in place regulations against the production of poor quality m-sand, is under scrutiny by the State government, the officials added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xs9kta/article30637878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THM-SAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/m-sand-units-come-under-the-scanner/article30637879.ece
396,2020/01/24,"DLF, backed by GIC, to invest ₹5,000 cr. to develop IT park","After nearly a decade, the DLF project in Taramani is set to take off with Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami laying the foundation stone on Thursday. The realty developer, backed by Singapore’s sovereign fund GIC, will be investing ₹5,000 crore to develop a 6.8 million sq. ft IT park in Taramani. The project, DLF Downtown Taramani, spread over 27 acres, is a joint venture with the Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO). With this, Chennai will become DLF’s second largest market after Gurugram.

It may be recalled that in 2008, DLF won the bid by offering ₹750 crore for a land parcel, measuring 26.64 acres, in Taramani. In 2010, DLF decided to pull out of the project and asked the Tamil Nadu government to refund its money. When the State government refused to give the money, DLF moved the matter to the Madras High Court.

Pointing out that all issues had been sorted out and the firm was betting big on Tamil Nadu, Mohit Gujral, chief executive officer, DLF Limited, said: “Tamil Nadu has always been a destination of choice for corporates and MNCs due to its talent pool. We are investing ₹5,000 crore, in phases, for developing our fourth project, DLF Downtown.”

The Chief Minister, while delivering his speech, said, “Due to the constant efforts of my government, many new investment projects are commencing successfully in Tamil Nadu.” Referring to the Global Investors’ Meet, that was held in January 2019, he said, “Within a span of one year, we were able to support the beginning of the commercial production of 59 GIM projects. Another 213 projects are under various stages of implementation.” Mr. Palaniswami also said that the government had been making efforts to improve the infrastructure at the IT Corridor. “Many new projects, like Phase 2 of the Metro, widening of the OMR Road with bye-passes at Kelambakkam and Thirupporur and flyovers at various key junctions, at a total cost of ₹1,150 crore, are being taken up,” he added.

In phases

The company will commence construction of the 2.5 million-sq ft of built up area in the first phase, and is expected to finish the entire development by mid 2021; the subsequent phases will be developed over time. Once fully operational, DLF Downtown will provide over 70,000 direct employment and over 6,000 ancillary employment opportunities.

Sriram Khattar, managing director, DLF Rental Business, said, “With DLF Downtown, we will now have a commercial presence of 14 million sq. ft. in the city. The company has identified a development pipeline of 20 million sq. ft. and construction of 5.5 million sq. ft. is under way.” He added, “This will augment our existing 32 million sq. ft. rental portfolio, and we plan to take the national portfolio to over 50 million sq. ft., once new projects are completed.”

To a query on the expected rental revenues from this new project, Mr. Khattar said, “Our current annual rental revenue from DLF Cybercity Chennai is approximately ₹500 crore. Once phase 1 of DLF Downtown is completed and operational, our stabilised rental income from Chennai will be a substantial amount.”

DLF has been present in Chennai for the last 15 years. DLF Cybercity Chennai, in Manapakkam, is the largest IT SEZ in the State, and has contributed a cumulative export revenue of ₹66,000 crore since its inception. DLF offices, today, has approximately 32 million sq ft of commercial, IT and SEZ workspaces, spread across Delhi NCR, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Chandigarh, with another 20 million sq. ft. of commercial space under development and implementation in Chennai, Hyderabad and Gurugram.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8izlkk/article30637677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THDLFCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dlf-backed-by-gic-to-invest-5000-cr-to-develop-it-park/article30637678.ece

398,2020/01/24,"Budgeting for jobs, skilling and economic revival","The forthcoming Union Budget will determine whether India’s economic engine gets the steam needed for a rebound, or the current economic situation becomes even worse. Not just the future of the economy, the future of the country’s youth depends on the Budget.

The unemployment rate at 6.1% (Financial Year 2017-2018) is the highest in 45 years. The rate for urban youth in the 15-29 years category is alarmingly high at 22.5%. These figures, however, are just one of the many problems, as pointed out by the Periodic Labour Force Survey. The Labour Force Participation Rate has come down to 46.5% for the ‘15 years and above’ age category. It is down to 37.7% for the urban youth. Even among those employed, a large fraction get low wages and are stuck with ‘employment poverty’.

Structural factors

The prolonged, and ongoing, slowdown, is the main reason behind the depressing employment scenario, though several structural factors have also contributed to the situation. The GDP growth for the second quarter of Financial Year 2019-2020 is 4.5%, the lowest in the last six years, for which a decline in private consumption and investment are the factors primarily responsible. The aggregate investment stands at less than 30% of the GDP, a rate much lower than the 15-year average of 35%. The capacity utilisation in the private sector is down to 70%-75%.

While the structural factors need addressing, in the interim, the Budget should also focus on reviving demand to promote growth and employment. Schemes like PM-KISAN and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) are good instruments to boost rural demand. It is really unfortunate that in the current fiscal year, a significant proportion of the budgetary allocation for PM-KISAN will go unutilised. Farmers and landless labourers spend most of their income. This means that income transfers to such groups will immediately increase demand. Further, rural India consumes a wide range of goods and services; so, if allocation and disbursement is raised significantly, most sectors of the economy will benefit. And, the payoff will be immediate.

Besides, rural unemployment can be reduced by raising budgetary allocation for irrigation projects and rural infrastructure like roads, cold storage and logistical chains. These facilities, along with a comprehensive crop insurance scheme, can drastically increase agricultural productivity and farmers’ income. Moreover, by integrating farms with mandis, such investments will reduce wastage of fruits and vegetables, thereby leading to a decrease in the frequency of inflationary shocks and their impact.

Boosting urban employment

In urban areas, construction and related activities are a source of employment for more than five crore people; across the country, the sector’s employment figures are second only to those of the agriculture sector. These projects, along with infrastructure, support 200-odd sectors, including core sectors like cement and steel.

However, due to the crisis in the real-estate and infrastructure sectors, construction activities have come to a grinding halt. At present, many real-estate projects are caught up in legal disputes — between home-buyers and developers; between lenders and developers; and between developers and law enforcement agencies like the Enforcement Directorate. The sector has an unsold inventory of homes, worth several lakh crores.

Even worse, multiple authorities — the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA); the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT); and the many consumer courts — have jurisdiction over disputes. Consequently, restructuring and liquidation of bad projects is very difficult, and in turn, is a main source of the problem of Non-Performing Assets faced by the Non-Banking Financial Companies.

To revive demand for housing, the Budget can raise the limit for availing tax exemption on home loans. The ₹25,000-crore fund set up by the centre to bailout 1,600 housing projects should be put to use immediately. The funds should be used to salvage all projects that are 80% complete and not under liquidation process under the NCLT. Several additional measures can also help. For example, there should be a single adjudication authority.

The multiplier effects of spending on infrastructure and housing in terms of higher growth and employment are large and extensive. Therefore, the ₹102-lakh-crore National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) programme is a welcome step. If implemented successfully, it will boost the infrastructure investment over the next five years by 2%-2.5% of the GDP annually.

Private sector’s risk appetite

Here, the problem is that more than 60% of the planned investment is expected from the private sector and the States. The government does not seem to realise that for private investment, regulatory certainty is as important as the cost of capital. Many infrastructure projects are languishing due to regulatory hurdles and contractual disputes between construction companies and government departments. As a result, infrastructure investment has come to be perceived as very risky. This is the major reason behind non-availability of private capital for infrastructure.

In this scenario, where the private sector has very little appetite for risky investments and State finances are shaky due to low GST collection, the onus is on the Centre to ensure that the programme does not come a cropper. The budgetary support to infrastructure will have to be much more than the NIP projection at 1.11% of the GDP.

Bidding and contracting for new roads, highways, railway tracks and urban development projects is a lengthy process. This is also the reason why several infrastructure-linked Ministries like those for civil aviation and roads have not been able to spend money allocated to them in the current fiscal year. Therefore, rather than earmarking budgetary support for new projects, the focus should be on projects that are currently under implementation so as to complete them as soon as possible. That is, funding should be front-loaded. In addition to creating employment, a timely completion of infrastructure projects will help increase competitiveness of the economy.

The distress among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is another area of concern. For many products produced by these enterprises, the GST rates are higher for inputs than the final goods. Due to this anomaly, around ₹20,000 crore gets stuck with the government annually in the form of input tax credits. This has increased cost of doing business for SMEs, which employ over 11 crore people.

Next, according to some estimates, there are more than 22 lakh vacancies in various government departments. Such dereliction is baffling when the unemployment among youth is very high.

Job openings that arise in the private sector put a premium on practical skills and work experience. Here, popular perception is that a good job requires a college or university degree. This misperception is the result of failure of the governments to provide affordable and good quality vocational training programmes.

To stop the demographic dividend from becoming a national burden, there is a need to invest heavily in skilling of the youth. Besides, the Budget should give tax incentives to companies and industrial units to encourage them to provide internships and on-site vocational training opportunities. This work experience can be supplemented with teaching of relevant theories. at educational centres set up at district levels. Distance education mode can also used for the purpose.

399,2020/01/24,Ties with Myanmar,"The ‘Go East’ policy has not brought the expected gains for India. On the other hand, the ‘Go South’ policy of China is paying rich dividends and Beijing is consolidating through its ‘String of pearls’ approach from Myanmar to Maldives. China is active in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Maldives, besides being a key participant in Pakistan. Beijing has always been interested in a cross-Himalayan trade and connectivity network and Nepal is now a another key link. Its participation in multiple infrastructure projects in Myanmar or, for that matter, Pakistan, has caused considerable concern in India. India’s relationship with Myanmar goes back in time due to the spread of Buddhism. Myanmar is a resource-rich neighbour and India can significantly benefit by partnering with it more closely.

400,2020/01/24,Supreme Court on CAA,"The Supreme Court’s refusal to stay the Constitution (Amendment) Act came as a surprise. It was even more baffling that the apex court gave the Central government four weeks to give its reply. One is at a loss to understand why the court took this long a time to hear the petitions if it only had to consider referring the issue to a larger Bench. With the people of the country, particularly the Muslims, still reeling from the shock of the court’s Ayodhya verdict, its refusal to stay the CAA even temporarily has added insult to injury. It is alleged that some BJP-ruled States like Uttar Pradesh have already started acting on the CAA. Giving a verdict after all the damage has been done will not be of much use.

It looked like the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister was threatening the anti-CAA protesters, rather than addressing a rally of CAA supporters. The term azadi has been defined by the protesters several times. They want freedom from the flawed CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC); freedom from discrimination; freedom from unemployment and other issues affecting the society. The Chief Minister seems to have ignored these comments. Further, it is unfortunate that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders are adamant in their statements that it is the Opposition that is spearheading these protests.

403,2020/01/24,"‘Disco Raja’ movie review: Begins with promise, but an overdose of retro is the dampener","A mainstream masala film celebrates the hero, tries to make us suspend our disbelief and give in to that larger-than-life world where things don’t necessarily play by logic. A well thought-out masala film that offers something new can be good fun. In that sense, Disco Raja begins with promise.

Director Vi Anand does the opposite of a rousing hero introduction scene. Somewhere in Ladakh (this portion was shot in Iceland though), men on bikes drag away someone who’s been brutally beaten up and leave him to die. We don’t see his face but the background score gives away who he could be. In a regular film, we’d expect this man to stir, fight back and beat these guys to a pulp. But no, it doesn’t happen here.

We see him later in a futuristic ‘Relive’ bio lab where doctors/scientists are experimenting to see if they can revive a dead man.

Meanwhile, we are shown a middle-class family in Delhi waiting for the return of their breadwinner, Vasu (Ravi Teja).

Disco Raja Cast: Ravi Teja, Bobby Simha, Payal Rajput, Nabha Natesh

Direction: Vi Anand

Music: S S Thaman

Back in the science lab, the dead man is revived but has no memory of his identity. The chief scientist wants him to be just an experimental lab rat and warns his team — Parineeti (Tanya Hope) and Phalguni (Vennela Kishore) — to not trigger his memory. But we know how science fiction movies go; the ‘subject’ won’t remain in the lab for long.

All that unfolds in these initial portions aren’t entirely new; there are both resemblances and hat tips to Les Mayfield’s Encino Man, and Captain America.

The family that’s waiting for Vasu, and his lady love Nabha (Nabha Natesh) trying to keep them happy is all familiar territory, and quite boring too.

The real story begins when the resurrected man breaks free and wears his headphones, a vestige of his past. The memories come rushing, one by one.

Vi Anand imagines Ravi Teja, with his ability for mad cap fun, as a gangster who’s also a huge disco fan and runs a retro bar in Madras in the early 1980s. This character isn’t called Vasu but Disco Raja. Sounds like fun, isn’t it?

Men and women strut around sporting sideburns, long hair and winged eyeliners.

There’s gang rivalry as well. Early on in the film when Seshu (Bobby Simha) is first shown as an aged gangster, the 80s Rajinikanth Tamil song ‘Aasai nooru vagai’ from Adutha Varisu plays in the background. It’s a hint that we’ll see more of that retro world from Madras where the gangsters speak a mix of Tamil and Telugu, as the story progresses.

It’s an interesting premise and ideally, should pack in fun. There’s fun, definitely. For instance, the episode where Disco Raja cooks biryani as his opponents are being dealt with simultaneously. There are plenty of references to pop culture of the times — Mithun Chakraborty’s Disco Dancer, Kamal Haasan starrer Sathya, Rajinikanth films, Chiranjeevi’s Khaidi, and even the transition in Bollywood from Rajesh Khanna to Amitabh Bachchan.

Payal Rajput as Helen plays the retro heroine to the hilt. Thaman has a blast with the background score and cinematographer Karthik Ghattamaneni amplifies the the retro setting beautifully.

The entire retro portion is dished out in a deliberately outlandish manner, with a lot of swagger. But these portions also get indulgently long. By the time the timeline shifts and more scores are settled in the present scenario, it feels like a lot has happened. The end is both rushed and staid.

Disco Raja’s best moments are when it taps into Ravi Teja’s potential to deliver effortless fun. He dances to retro beats with sheer joy and beats his enemies to a pulp. Nabha’s is a brief role with not much scope. Sunil pulls off a surprise but that episode where he reveals his real self is a patience-testing one.

For all the menacing aura with which Bobby Simha is introduced, his character is poorly fleshed out too. The impact of the clash between him and Disco Raja is drowned in the overdose of the retro styling. The biggest grouse, however, is with the characterisation of Vasu. When you get two Ravi Tejas instead of one, why reduce one to a prop?

Generous trimming and some more attention to a few characters could have made this a different film.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/z4l1k0/article30643478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/disco-raja,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/disco-raja-movie-review-begins-with-promise-but-an-overdose-of-retro-is-the-dampener/article30643479.ece
404,2020/01/24,How the mighty fall,"Sadanam Harikumar is one of the most prolific playwrights in contemporary Kathakali. His 18th play, Kaali, also directed by him, made its début at the 67th annual day celebrations of Gandhi Seva Sadanam Kathakali Academy, Pathiripala at Palakkad, recently.

The story is an adaptation of Darikan’s death at the hands of Goddess Kaali. While Darikan and Kaali are from mythology, the other characters are the writer’s creation. The play is also a commentary on the social discrimination of Dalits.

Darikan, the demon king, emboldened by the fact that only a daughter of Lord Siva will be able to kill him, unleashes a reign of terror. From the sky he happens to see a Dalit woman, Santhala, and forces his attention on her. Santhala is a Siva devotee but Darikan overrules her objections. Shanthala runs to her brother, Jhalakan, for protection but Darika kills him and overpowers her. Angry and humiliated, Santhala immolates herself, praying to be reborn as Lord Siva’s daughter and be the cause of Darikan’s death. Lord Siva, hearing about the misdeeds of Darikan, creates Kaali and orders her to kill Darika.

Swagger in the walk

Sadanam Manikantan as Darikan, a Kathi character, and Sadanam Bhasi as Kaali stood out in their roles. Throughout the performance, Manikantan maintained the swagger and arrogance of the powerful. Santhala by Sadanam Sreenath looked a little subdued when facing Darikan’s advances but did well in the later scene when Santhala seeks Siva’s intervention in a vengeful mood. Bhasi’s footwork is always a delight to watch and he didn’t disappoint. The pada purappad, or battle drill, where Kaali prepares to challenge Darika to war was a brisk rhythmic delight. Sadanam Vipin Chandran as Jhalakan and Sadanam Nithin Prasad as Siva were competent in their roles. Two Sadanam students — Akshay and Krishnaswaraj — appeared as the Brahmins being persecuted by Darikan.

Vocals were led by Harikumar himself. He was assisted by Sadanam Sivadasan and Sadanam Jyothish Babu. The lyrics in pure Malayalam were easy to follow and the music was mellifluous. The padam ‘Karathalam kondu’ in Subhapantuvarali was especially pleasing. The action-packed scenes were well supported by the percussion team led by Sadanam Ramakrishnan and Sadanam Jithin on the chenda and Sadanam Devadasan and Sadanam Jayarajan on the maddalam.

Eye-catching costume

Harikumar is not shy of innovations and Kaali is no exception. In nritta or pure dance, choreography for Darikan after his thiranottam, as well as the iratti kalasam in the slow-paced padinja padam, had new elements. But it was the costume that captured the eye first. The make-up and headgear of Kaali, though different from the traditional look of Bhadrakali in Dakshayagam, was impressive. However, the blue facial make-up of Jhalakan looked out of place. Whatever be the logic, it would have been more prudent to stick to the conventional green of pacha characters.

In the battle scene between Kaali and Darikan, too many props were used one after the other — bow and arrow, sword and shield, mace, spear and finally a trident. Kathakali’s language is most impressive when conveyed through the actor’s body language with as few stage props as possible. The battle scene could have used some editing and make the entire three-and-a-half hour play tighter.

Overall, Kaali is an entertaining production from the house of Sadanam and will certainly be appreciated by viewers who are inclined towards fast-paced stories.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/jqoav7/article30623389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24tvfKaali1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/kaali-directed-by-sadanam-harikumar-touches-upon-the-discrimination-of-dalits/article30623391.ece
405,2020/01/24,BJP leader told me that my phone was being tapped: Raut,"Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on January 24 said that a BJP leader had informed him that his phone was being tapped by the previous Devendra Fadnavis government in Maharashtra.

On the NCP’s allegation that the Centre has withdrawn party chief Sharad Pawar’s security at his official residence in New Delhi, Mr. Raut said it could have been because Mr. Pawar was instrumental in forming the Shiv Sena-led government in the State.

“A BJP leader had told me that my phone was being tapped. I said if anybody wants to listen to what I am saying, I welcome it. I am Balasaheb’s chela (disciple). Whatever I do, I do it openly,” Mr. Raut told reporters here.

“In spite of the phone-tapping, we formed the government in Maharashtra,” he added.

Mr. Raut’s remarks come a day after State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh alleged that the Fadnavis dispensation misused government machinery to tap phones of Opposition leaders, especially during the formation of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.

“The cyber cell of Maharashtra police has been asked to look into the various complaints of snooping/phone-tapping that came in during the previous government,” Mr. Deshmukh had said on January 23.

Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh had earlier also alleged that phones of Opposition leaders were tapped by the Fadnavis government. He had also raised questions about the involvement of officials in the phone-tapping episode.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9okscf/article30643695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SANJAYRAUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjp-leader-told-me-that-my-phone-was-being-tapped-raut/article30643696.ece
406,2020/01/24,Fadnavis denies allegations of ‘phone tapping’,"Maharashtra’s ruling coalition of the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, have seized on allegations of phone tapping of senior party leaders by the previous government led by the BJP. However, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has denied the allegations.

The NCP has also alleged that the Koregaon-Bhima riot in Pune in 2018 was orchestrated in a bid to frame Dalit and Ambedkarite activists.

Accusing the previous BJP-led government in Maharashtra of tapping phones of senior NCP and Congress leaders during the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh on Friday said he had ordered a probe into the matter.

“The previous BJP-led government had tapped phones of senior NCP and Congress leaders through government mechanism ahead of the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls held last year,” Mr Deshmukh said on Friday while announcing the probe.

“We have also ordered a probe into allegations that spyware Pegasus was used to snoop on officials and activists during the previous government’s rule. We will check which officers travelled to Israel during the period to allegedly procure this malware,” Mr. Deshmukh said.

NCP leader and Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said the phone tapping episode shows the perverted mentality of the BJP. “I have also been questioning the arrests in Koregaon-Bhima riot in the State Assembly. It looked staged even then as only Dalit and Ambedkarite workers were targeted by probe agencies,” he said.

Former Chief Minister and Leader of Opposition Fadnavis has denied the allegations. “Phone-tapping is not the culture of Maharashtra. My government had not given any such orders,” he said. “The State government is free to probe the allegations with the help of any machinery. People of Maharashtra know the truth. A Shiv Sena leader was the Minister of State for Home during my tenure. I have a request — the government should immediately conduct an inquiry and make the report public. If it wants to go to Israel for the probe, it should do that,” he said.

Responding to Mr Fadnavis, Sena MLA Deepak Kesarkar, who was the Minister of State (Home) in the previous BJP-Sena government said the authority of an MoS is limited and he had no knowledge of such snooping.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/l1w8nn/article30643619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEVENDRAFADNAVIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/my-government-didnt-tap-phones-but-state-free-to-probe-fadnavis/article30643620.ece
407,2020/01/24,"GoAir suspends flights citing shortage, non-delivery of aircraft","GoAir has announced the suspension of several flights owing to non-availability of aircraft. The shortage is due to grounding of planes for lack of engines and non-delivery by the aircraft manufacturer. The airline did not specify the number of flights cancelled or the number in shortage.

The budget airline, which has been cancelling certain flights from several routes at short notice in the past weeks, has now come forward to admit that there has been a real demand-supply gap in aircraft that will last till early March, considered a busy schedule.

A GoAir spokesperson said in a statement:

“In the last four weeks, we have gone through unplanned grounding of aircraft [due to lack of upgraded engines to be supplied by Pratt & Whitney], which were supporting our current operation of fleet. And now, we have been informed by Airbus and Pratt & Whitney of their inability to deliver previously promised aircraft and engines through 9 March 2020 that are required to support our current growth.

“As a result, we have been forced to temporarily suspend certain flights that are part of our network, schedule and [are] open for sale. We have undertaken these suspensions as far ahead of time as possible in order to minimize the inconvenience to our customers.

“Despite our best efforts, we realise that our flight suspensions may inconvenience our customers, which we regret and profusely apologise. We expect, with the support of Airbus and Pratt & Whitney, we will reinstate these flights and operate at the earliest opportunity.”

The airline said its currently published schedule incorporated a conservative view of aircraft and engine deliveries as provided by Airbus and Pratt & Whitney to minimise, or eliminate, the need for flight cancellations in the future.

GoAir has 57 aircraft, of which 42 are A320neos with Pratt & Whitney engines. Out of these 42, an unspecified number of planes were grounded as Pratt & Whitney did not supply upgraded engines as per a directive of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).

As per the DGCA order, at least one of the Pratt & Whitney neo engines, which has safety concerns, needs to be replaced by May 31, 2020. So, all such aircraft with Pratt & Whitney engines that have crossed the stipulated flying of 3900 hours have been grounded.

Besides this, the scheduled deliveries from Airbus have stopped from December 2019 and it has communicated that it could only resume supplies from March 9. As a result, GoAir has not received four or five new aircraft, resulting in the shortfall.

Out of its original order of 144 A320neo aircraft, 102 are on schedule for delivery till the end of 2025. Every year, the airline is to receive 12 to 15 new aircraft. The sudden disruption in delivery has caused concerns and flight disruptions.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/h9i0g6/article30640749.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GOAIRTNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/goair-suspends-flights-owing-to-shortage-of-aircraft-engines/article30640747.ece

The girls, aged between 14 and 15, went missing from their homes in Sangharsh Nagar on Tuesday. Their parents then approached the police and a case of kidnapping was registered. The police said the girls used to chat daily on their phones with a youth from the same locality, senior police inspector Jitendra Bhobe said.

409,2020/01/24,Woman gets jail for driving minor to attempt suicide,"A court in Thane has awarded three years’ rigorous imprisonment to a 40-year-old woman for driving a 14-year-old girl to attempt suicide in 2016. District Judge R.S. Gupta in his order on Wednesday also imposed a fine of ₹15,000 on the accused, Surekha Gaikwad, and ordered that ₹10,000 from it be given to the victim.

The accused was pronounced guilty under Section 195-A (whoever threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation or property) of the Indian Penal Code. Additional public prosecutor Rekha Hiwrale told the court the victim and the accused, a shopkeeper, were residents of Kopri.

Before the incident, during an identification parade in a case of stalking and molestation filed by the victim, she had identified a man as the accused. Gaikwad, who was acquainted with the man, grew annoyed and asked the victim not to depose in court against him.

The woman also threatened the victim that since she had identified the man in the case, he would throw acid on her when he is released from jail.

Upset over the threat, the victim hanged herself at her home on October 12, 2016, when her mother had gone out for work and her father had stepped outside the house. When the victim did not open the door, her parents raised an alarm. Their neighbours rushed in and broke open the door.

The victim was rushed to a hospital, where she underwent treatment. Based on a police complaint filed by the victim, an FIR was registered against Gaikwad. The judge in his order said the prosecution had proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/h3osiw/article30640313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16bmsuicidehelplinecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/woman-gets-jail-for-driving-minor-to-attempt-suicide/article30640314.ece

The Class III student and resident of Shanti Nagar in Mira Road fell ill after the incident on January 17 and had to be hospitalised, a police official said.

“According to the complaint filed by the child’s mother, the teacher, identified as Lata, had also allegedly stripped the girl and beat her up with a cane last month for not doing her homework,” Sohel Pathan, sub-inspector, Naya Nagar police station, said.

When the girl returned home from the tuition class, her mother noticed that the child was unable to walk because of swelling in both her legs, the official said. The girl was rushed to a hospital and administered treatment for her injuries. The mother filed the police complaint against the teacher on January 18, the official said.

The mother said the teacher appeared indifferent when she confronted her, the police said. Based on the complaint, the teacher has been booked under Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the Indian Penal Code, and relevant provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.

He said offering prayers to Lord Ram has got nothing to do with the common minimum programme, on the basis of which the three ideologically different parties came together to form a government in Maharashtra.

It will be Mr. Thackeray’s first visit to Ayodhya since his party severed ties with the BJP over sharing of power after elections in October last year.

“We will invite everybody, including our allies to join. Everyone worships Lord Ram at home. So, they can join us in offering prayers at Ayodhya,” said Mr. Raut.

Mr. Thackeray had earlier put off a visit to Ayodhya in November 24, 2019 after the NCP’s core committee resolved to form an alternative government.

Mr. Thackeray was sworn in as Chief Minister on November 28, 2019 and recently completed 50 days in office.

412,2020/01/24,No mention of Tanaji’s ‘birthplace’ draws ire,"Residents of Godoli village in Satara district, who claim that Maratha soldier Tanaji Malusare was born there, are unhappy over the place not finding a mention in the Hindi film Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, which documents the valour of the 17th century military leader.

The residents have decided to raise the issue during their village meeting and take it up with the makers of the film, which stars Ajay Devgn in the titular role. Actors Saif Ali Khan and Kajol also feature in the Om Raut directed film, which was released on January 10.

In the movie, Tanaji has been shown as hailing from Umrat in Konkan. Some locals claim that Tanaji was born in Godoli village, which, they said, is also known in Marathi as Tanhaji cha parada (Tanaji’s enclosure).

Remnants preserved

A few years ago, remnants of Tanaji’s house were discovered in the village and were preserved, a local resident said. “Some of it was used during the construction of his memorial in the village,” the villager said. “We are unhappy with the makers of the film. As he was born in Godoli, at least his early childhood days here should have been shown and some shoots for the movie should have taken place in the village,” he said. He also alleged that a “wrong history” of Tanaji was being presented to the world.

Another local said a year ago they had requested Shital Malusare, the 13th descendant of Tanaji, that Godoli village be mentioned in the film. The villagers have now sought a meeting with the makers of the film over the issue, he said. “We will also take up this issue in the gram sabha and chalk out future course of action,” a villager said.

Runaway success

The film, based on Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s trusted lieutenant and legendary military leader who played a pivotal role in capturing the Kondana Fort (now known as Sinhagad Fort) located near Pune, has grossed over ₹150 crore at box office.

The Maharashtra Cabinet, at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Wednesday had approved a proposal to exempt the period drama from tax in the State.

Devgn took to Twitter on Wednesday to thank the Maha Vikas Aghadi government for making his film tax-free. He tweeted, “Thank you Uddhav Thackeray ji for declaring #TanhajiTheUnsungWarrior tax-free in the state of Maharashtra. @OfficeofUT @CMOMaharashtra.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1dp7cx/article30640287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMTANHAJI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-mention-of-tanajis-birthplace-draws-ire/article30640288.ece
413,2020/01/24,Exhibition encourages students to pick media as career option,"A group of students from municipal schools and St. Xavier’s College got together to set up an exhibition on how the media industry functions. Titled ‘Education Beyond Books’, the exhibition aimed at encouraging school students to look beyond the fields of engineering, medicine and law as career options.

The two-day exhibition held at the mass media department of St. Xavier’s College concluded on Thursday.

The exhibits included a live newsroom and studio complete with an audience, a section on print media showcasing a magazine and newspaper developed by the schoolchildren, a live radio station, an audiovisual room playing a documentary, and a photography booth called ‘Third Eye’.

One of the highlights was a tunnel that gave visitors the experience of being surrounded by media, and a game booth where one could choose a career option by throwing frisbees.

‘Giving back to society’

All the exhibits were developed by the group of schoolchildren with guidance from students of Bachelors of Mass Media (BMM). The exhibition was conceptualised and curated by Salaam Bombay Foundation. Perrie Subramaniam, head of B.M.M. department at St. Xavier’s College, said it is important for students to share their knowledge with society and not wait until they graduate.

“We always teach our students to give back to society and involve them in social enterprises. We got affiliated with Salaam Bombay to make sure that our students remain grounded, and know that it is not only them who are filled with knowledge, but also these kids who are underprivileged,” Ms. Subramaniam said.

Beyond classrooms

“The collaboration with St. Xavier’s was to let our children experience the college environment and allow them to interact with students who are specialising in the field of media,” said Santosh Bodade, project coordinator for media academy at Salaam Bombay Foundation.

Sayli Jhadhav, a Class VIII student from a municipal school in Tardeo, said she enjoyed the process of learning outside classrooms. “Interviewing people was my favourite part,” she said.

First-year BMM student Pankhuri Joshi said it is important for schoolchildren to understand the significance of media. “We are in an era where we are constantly surrounded by media everywhere,” she said.

Another BMM student, Natasha Dedhia, said it was a great experience to help the young children with voice modulation as they were quite shy in the beginning. “Gradually, they became confident,” she said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wecu0z/article30638281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMSALAAMBOMBAYMUMBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/exhibition-encourages-students-to-pick-media-as-career-option/article30638282.ece
414,2020/01/24,Varsity’s Fort campus to get ₹200-crore makeover,"The 162-year-old Fort campus of Mumbai University is set to undergo a makeover worth ₹200 crore over four years in an attempt to turn it into a centre of excellence offering a cultural space and public engagement.

“The Fort campus, despite its heritage structure and enormous space, is not really buzzing with student activities as seen in foreign universities. The makeover is aimed at bringing back the old glory and beauty of the campus,” said Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar.

Mr. Pawar, along with Higher and Technical Education Minister Uday Samant, cleared the decision in a meeting on Wednesday. The project aims at revamping the look of the university building, the entrance, the outer spaces, conference rooms, seminar room, class rooms, multipurpose rooms and library.

As per the presentation made by conservation architect Abha Narain Lambah in the meeting on Wednesday, the proposed zoning on the campus will include administration and security, a campus development unit, libraries, cafes and seminar halls on the ground floor. On the first floor, the zones will have executive offices, VIP meeting rooms and conference rooms while the second floor will consist of classrooms. Several departments will be moved to a different floor as a result of the proposed zoning.

According to an official from the Higher and Technical Education Department, the move is also aimed at increasing citizen interaction on the campus for various activities. “Mumbai University’s Fort campus will provide a collective space for the incubation of ideas, cultural events, intellectual discourse and increasing student activities after this makeover,” said an official. He said there will be no new construction, but only the conservation of the heritage structure.

The State will release ₹50 crore for each year as the work progresses. A few departments from the Kalina campus may also be shifted to the Fort campus in due course, said an official.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/w895jd/article30638271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMMUMBAIUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/varsitys-fort-campus-to-get-200-crore-makeover/article30638272.ece

416,2020/01/24,Children travel in ‘Innovation Bus’,"Innovation Carnival, a four-day event featuring models made by children in an ‘Innovation Bus’ to address problems in their surroundings, got under way on Wednesday.

The carnival is the culmination of a three-month educational programme initiated by Bengaluru-based non-governmental organisation Agastya International Foundation. The NGO created the ‘Banao Buses’ to put innovative ideas on wheels and take students from school to school.

“The idea of ‘Banao Buses’ has first been implemented in Maharashtra. After being launched in Worli, the bus was in Navi Mumbai and will return to Worli for the Innovation Carnival,” said Nitin Desai, General Manager of Agastya Foundation. The bus will subsequently head to Pune.

The NGO has been leading a programme with government schools in Maharashtra for the past three months, with the aim of uplifting underprivileged students to create solutions from issues around them. The prototypes of these solutions are on display at the Innovation Carnival. “Our main aim is to provide children with a new perspective and give them the means to make a difference to students and society. In this regard, we are writing to government schools so that we can take the buses to them,” said Mr. Desai.

The four-day event kicked off with an inauguration function at Nehru Centre in Worli.

“It is important to ask questions as it builds curiosity. Today, students in schools mostly learn how to write answers but they do not know how to ask questions,” said Ramji Raghavan, Chairperson of Agastya International Foundation.

‘Learn to ask questions’

To innovate or create something students must ask questions, he said. “If you ask questions, you will learn something new... The more you ask questions, the more you learn.” He also urged students to share their experiences and experiments with their colleagues and maintain togetherness.

Examination results, Mr. Raghavan said, were just pieces of paper which did not decide students’ future. “Always work with enthusiasm and work hard, no matter what the result is.”

Students from schools in Vashi, Belapur, Airoli, Nerul, among others, are participating in the carnival. About 800 students from different schools are expected to visit on each of the four days. Apart from the student exhibits, the carnival will also host 14 steam-based exhibits to help visiting students create a new and far more sustainable earth along with workshops on themes such as design thinking and art.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/h9twcz/article30638236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMINNOVATIONCARNIVAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/children-travel-in-innovation-bus/article30638238.ece
417,2020/01/24,"Man tries to rob relative, two held","Two men from Delhi, who had allegedly come to Navi Mumbai to rob a family on the instructions of a relative of the family, were arrested on Wednesday, while the main accused and one accomplice managed to flee.

Jishan Rizwan Khan (22), who hails from Uttar Pradesh and currently lives in Delhi, is a relative of Reshma Ali Mohammad Khan (41), a resident of Sector 21 in APMC. Ms. Khan’s husband works at the APMC fruit market and always keeps cash in the house, which Mr. Jishan was aware of.

“He knew that during the early hours of the day, her husband would be at the market. He thought she would be alone at home and arranged three accomplices from Delhi to rob the house,” police sub-inspector Deva Damale from APMC police station said.

Around 7.30 a.m. on Wednesday, Mr. Jishan — his face covered with a hand towel — and the men knocked on the door of Ms. Khan’s house. Mr. Jishan shouted from outside that he wanted to give his son’s wedding invitation.

“The complainant found the voice familiar and though the accused had not said who he was, she opened the door. On entering the house, the accused threatened her with a knife and told her to hand over valuables. But the complainant’s children were also at home, which the accused did not know. The kids pounced on the men, trying to protect their mother. Mr. Jishan attacked all of them with the knife and in the process, his face was unmasked and the family recognised him,” police inspector Basit Ali Sayyed said.

In the meantime, the neighbours hearing the family’s cries, came to help and caught hold of two of the men, while Mr. Jishan and the third accomplice managed to escape.

Ms. Khan, her daughter Tarannum (19), and sons Aman (17) and Chaman (15), received injuries on their hands and taken to hospital. While the others have been discharged, Tarannum has been admitted due to cuts on her veins.

The two arrested men have been identified as Shahbaz Sadiq Ali Khan (20) and Najeem Khan (21).

418,2020/01/24,"A chronicle of Vrindavan, from a U.S. author","John Stratton Hawley, who has authored or edited over 20 books on Hinduism, India’s bhakti traditions and the comparative study of religion, has now written Krishna’s Playground: Vrindavan in the 21st century.

Mr. Hawley is a Professor of Religion at Barnard College, Columbia University, U.S.A., and his new book traces the transformation that the city has undergone over the past 15 years.

Mr. Hawley says, “In 1975-76, the ISKCON temple was coming up in the city. The liberalisation of the Indian economy in the early 90s had made all kinds of investments possible which were not possible before. Due, to this the ISKCON temple is now at the geographical centre of Vrindavan,” says Mr. Hawley.

In September 2016, Mr. Hawley visited Vrindavan and found that he was in the middle of a series of very heated controversies. “[It was] about development, buildings and water which is no longer in the river Yamuna,” he says.

“The [most recent reportage] in the book is [from] early 2019. It is about Prime Minister Modi coming to Vrindavan to celebrate the three billionth lunch served by Akshaya Patra.”

John Hawley has authored or edited over 20 books on Hinduism. (Right) The cover of the latest book.

Mr. Hawley was introduced to Indian religions and mythologies late in life. “I was almost 30 years old. I grew up with a kind of love-hate relationship with religion. I was worried about it on one hand but was deeply attracted to it on the other,” says Mr. Hawley. “I took a course on the religions of the world. It started with India and I just never escaped.”

Mr. Hawley says he grew up as a Christian but was attracted to Krishna. “As a Christian you would only think about Jesus. In one of the courses I took on religions across the world, I was introduced to Krishna through the Bhagavad Gita,” he says.

Mr. Hawley finds Jesus and Krishna a broad contrast to work with. He says on one side there is Jesus who really doesn’t know his identity in his early stages of life while on the other, there is Krishna, who has a royal side. “But on similarities, both are concerned about matters of state and issues of justice,” he said.

“The childhood of Krishna is full of play. This was the vision of divinity I never expected,” he said, stressing on the fact that religion [Christianity] is all about struggle, love and dealing with the Romans. “So, as in the case of love, sometimes the most unexpected person is the one who is going to attract you the most.

419,2020/01/24,"Uddhav tears into BJP, MNS, says he will stick by saffron","“I have neither changed my colour, nor my soul. Our ally (the Bharatiya Janata Party) tried to prove me wrong; how could I face my people? That is why I joined hands with those who were in the opposition for decades to form a government,” said Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday.

Mr. Thackeray was taking potshots at former ally BJP and also the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena, which got a new flag on Thursday. The CM was felicitated by his party for keeping his promise to late Sena founder Bal Thackeray on his birth anniversary.

The Shiv Sena founder was born on January 23, 1926, making Thursday his 94th birth anniversary. Politicians of all hue, Sainiks, and citizens thronged Bal Thackeray’s memorial at Shivaji Park to pay their respects.

The BJP’s Vinod Tawde was among those who visited the memorial. “I always come here to pay tribute to him; he was like a family leader for us. Devendraji also comes every year on the death anniversary. There is no political angle here.”

Senior Sena leader Sanjay Raut called Balasaheb ‘Hinduhridaysamrat’ after Veer Savarkar. Asked about the MNS grabbing the Hindutva plank, he said, “Hindutva is not a subject of competition, nobody will challenge the Sena’s Hindutva, we want Hindutva to spread.”

The Shiv Sena had organised a grand event at Bandra Kurla Complex for the felicitation. It emphasised the colour saffron, with chairs draped in the colours, and the party’s saffron flags spread across the ground. The CM also sported a saffron kurta and tilak. The event was marked with Maharashtrian folk dances and cultural performances. The CM was felicitated by 11 senior citizen Shiv Sainiks and given the ceremonial sword on stage.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Thackeray said, referring to his audience, “Today I have been felicitated. I didn’t accept any honours but today’s honour is yours. This is not my fulfilled promise but the first step towards it.” He took a dig at the BJP and MNS and said, “I took up this post because the then ally (BJP) broke its promise, the one they had given in Balasaheb’s room. They tried to prove me wrong, how would I face you? I can never lie to people, that’s why I took a different route and allied with those who were our opposition for decades. I did it openly, but that doesn’t mean our ideology has changed, that I have left Hindutva. Our colour and our soul are still the same, which is saffron.”

In 2014, the CM said, “the BJP had broken alliance with us and formed a government with an invisible hand. Now, the BJP is talking about the Sena’s real face but actually, they have been exposed. I never told Balasaheb that I will become CM but took it up for you... I dedicate this success to all Shiv Sainiks who worked for the party. Sainiks are my armour. We will never betray the trust you have shown,” he said, without naming his cousin Raj Thackeray of the MNS or the BJP directly.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/iblknk/article30638203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BM-Uddhav,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/uddhav-tears-into-bjp-mns-says-he-will-stick-by-saffron/article30638204.ece
420,2020/01/24,"Rethink duty-free plan, urge airports council, wine association","To further impress the concerns of airports over the government’s proposal to reduce duty-free liquor and tobacco allowances, the Airports Council International (ACI), a global trade representative of airports worldwide, and the International Spirits and Wines Association on behalf of multinational alcoholic beverage companies, have independently called for a status quo at Indian airports.

“We urge the authorities to reject this proposal. Not only is it inconsistent with the latest attempts by the government to incentivise private capital to invest in the airport industry, but it undermines the growth opportunity for Indian airports and duty-free providers who are a driving force in the local airport economy,” Stefano Baronci, director general, ACI Asia-Pacific, said.

“Duty-free operators must be able to count on the expansion of airport infrastructure along with new retail space and a regulatory framework that incentivises the market to grow. Unfortunately, the [Ministry of Commerce and Industry’s] proposal will limit this objective if airports cannot generate non-aeronautical revenues to cover aeronautical cost,” Mr. Baronci said.

The proposal restricts the purchase of tax-free alcohol at airport duty-free shops to one 1-litre bottle per passenger and the purchase of cigarette cartons.

Amrit Kiran Singh, executive chairman of International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), said calculations have shown this will have close to zero impact on the revenue/balance of trade/foreign exchange outflow of an economy of the size of India. However, it will have a major negative impact on sentiment.

“Duty free is an additional channel for business. The government should be encouraging additional channels for business in its efforts to re-energise the economy … over 75% of this channel is contributed by alcoholic beverages. Reducing 75% of this channel by 50% will break the back of this channel,” he said.

Mr. Singh said it would be unfair to compare the duty-free allowance of India with China or any other country as India has the highest basic customs duty (BCD) on alcoholic beverages at 150%. “China is less than 30%. Companies therefore use the duty-free channel to launch their upmarket brands. Duty free allows potential customers to try the new brand at a lower price and then buy it at full price (with 150%) duty if they like the brand. It, therefore, plays an important role in stimulating demand in the local economy,” he said.

ISWAI said the duty-free channel in India competes with that in Dubai, Singapore and London Heathrow. Volumes of scale help duty-free operators provide more attractive prices and range at their airports. “Reducing the allowance by half will reduce the importance of India duty free and make [it] less attractive than competing airports. Travellers will buy products at Dubai, Singapore and London before travelling to India. This will eventually kill the duty-free channel in India,” Mr. Singh said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hl1wdd/article30638197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMDUTYFREE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rethink-duty-free-plan-urge-airports-council-wine-association/article30638198.ece
421,2020/01/24,FGM survivors to release videos to make their stories known,"Sahiyo, a non-governmental organisation working to end the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM), and StoryCenter, an initiative that helps transform lives through listening to and sharing stories, will release 27 short videos created by FGM survivors and advocates from across the world.

Titled ‘Voices to End Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C)’, the videos will be released on February 6, International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM/C.

Voices to End FGM/C supports women and men impacted by the issue and encourages them to tell their stories from their perspectives. A press statement issued on Tuesday said the participants have received training on how to create videos at workshops held in-person or through webinars. “The programme was first launched in May 2018 as ‘Sahiyo Stories’, when Sahiyo and StoryCenter hosted a residential workshop on digital storytelling for nine FGM/C survivors in Berkeley, California.”

“The videos created at that workshop have been screened at various events transnationally,” the statement said. The 27 new digital stories will be released on Sahiyo’s YouTube page on February 6.

FGM/C is the practice of cutting or altering parts of a girl’s or a woman’s genitalia for cultural and non-medical purposes. Recognised by the United Nations as a human rights violation, the practice is prevalent in countries and communities globally and at least 3.9 million girls worldwide are at risk of being cut every year.

“I believe that to create change, we have to speak about the harms in our community and storytelling allows us to do that in a safe and non-judgemental way,” Sahiyo’s co-founder Mariya Taher said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/1rutyo/article30638188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMSahiyo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fgm-survivors-to-release-videos-to-make-their-stories-known/article30638189.ece
422,2020/01/24,Body in sack: elder brother arrested for Turbhe murder,"A day after finding the body of a 30-year-old man in a sack at Indira Nagar, Turbhe, MIDC police has arrested the deceased’s elder brother on charges of murder.

Santosh Kasbe’s body was found in a plastic sack on Wednesday morning, following which his brother Dinesh (33) identified the body and registered a murder case. Dinesh had claimed Santosh had left home on Monday for work and had not returned since then.

On investigating the case, the police found the claims to be false and arrested Dinesh.

“It has been established that the victim was killed by his brother in a fit of rage over a domestic quarrel. The role of other family members and associates in the murder is being investigated. Forensic evidence has been collected and key witnesses have been identified,” senior inspector Sachin Rane from Turbhe MIDC police station said.

“He was murdered in the wee hours of Wednesday using a chopper. The brothers used to have frequent domestic quarrels which led to the murder. The accused has a criminal record,” said Pankaj Dahane, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone I.

The deceased, who was married in 2011, lost his wife in 2015 to tuberculosis. He stayed in Indira Nagar with his three kids aged eight, six and five, his mother Sitabai (60), a visually challenged brother Ganesh (35), his wife Anju (19) and Dinesh.

423,2020/01/24,Navi Mumbai airport PAPs go on hunger strike to press for demands,"For over a month, a group of project affected people (PAPs) of the Navi Mumbai Airport, have been sitting outside CIDCO Bhavan with their demands.

Of the nearly 200 people who began the protest around 32 days ago, 12 are on a hunger strike, and three have been hospitalised for dehydration. Meanwhile, the ‘Sangharsh Samiti’ of 10 villages affected by the project has distanced itself from the protest, claiming they do not support the group’s claims.

“The leaders of the protest are not from any of the affected villages. Some of the participants are from the villages though. Some demands have been addressed while others have been taken up by us and we are in talks with CIDCO,” said Natha Patil, of the Samiti.

Ramchandra Mhatre, who represents the Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha from Raigad and has been heading the protest, said his group met the CIDCO managing director on January 16. “All he said was he needs time. We won’t move from here without getting our demands fulfilled. Hence, some of them are now on hunger strike while others sit with them through the day in support.”

Among the demands are compensation to the fishermen for the loss of livelihood, jobs for the youth, increase in construction aid to ₹2,500 from ₹1,500 per sq ft. and a re-look into villagers’ ‘zero eligibility’ status. “The loss of fishermen’s livelihood was addressed way back, following which CIDCO promised a jetty and a fishermen’s market. Our committee is discussing jobs for the youth with CIDCO. CIDCO had offered ₹1,000 per sq ft. as construction aid, which we took up with the Chief Minister and demanded ₹2,000 per sq ft. It was later increased to ₹1,500, which was accepted by all through our committee. People who had constructed homes after 2014, will have zero eligibility as per the rules. Genuine cases are looked into,” Mr. Patil said.

Advocate Prashant Bhoir, who represents four village committees that are part of the 10-village Sangharsh Samiti, said, “There is a process to get the demands processed and accepted. The way in which this group is protesting is not the way it should take place. The relevant issues are already being taken up by the committee.”

Mr. Mhatre, however, said, “Some of the houses are yet to be demolished. Once that’s done, CIDCO will pay no heed to us. We want CIDCO to hear us before the houses are demolished.”

CIDCO officials were unavailable for comment.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/u3ewht/article30638168.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMNAVIMUMBAIAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/navi-mumbai-airport-paps-go-on-hunger-strike-to-press-for-demands/article30638169.ece
424,2020/01/24,Kurla resident held for killing wife,"The Vinoba Bhave Nagar police on Thursday arrested a 43-year-old Kurla resident for allegedly killing his wife in their residence after suspecting her of infidelity.

According to the V.B. Nagar police, Dinesh Ingle (43), a resident of Christian village, got into an argument with his 37-year-old wife about her alleged extramarital affair on Thursday morning. As the argument got heated, Mr. Ingle grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed her five to six times on the neck and chest.

“Teighbours of the Ingles saw his clothes covered in blood while he was trying to run after locking the front door. They restrained him and called the police control room around 8.35 a.m., after which a police team reached Mr. Ingle’s residence and arrested him,” police sub-inspector Dipak Tayde, V.B. Nagar police station, said.

Mr Ingle was booked for murder under the Indian Penal Code.

‘Had eloped earlier’

Mr. Tayde said the victim had earlier eloped with different men six to seven times and there used to be constant fights between the couple over this.

“The accused was previously unemployed and had recently got a job as a driver. His unemployment was also one of the reasons behind the couple’s daily arguments. The accused had once filed a missing person complaint in her name when she ran away,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone-V) Niyati Thaker said.

Police officers said the couple had two sons aged eight and three years and the family had been living in a rented house at Christian village for the past three years.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kurla-resident-held-for-killing-wife/article30638147.ece
425,2020/01/24,Misfire by gun kills CRPF jawan outside Mukesh Ambani's residence,"A Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan, on security duty outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilla, on Peddar Road, died after getting accidentally shot on Wednesday.

According to the Gamdevi police, the incident occurred at around 7.30 p.m. on Wednesday, when Rambhai Bakotra (30), a Gujarat native, was removing his automatic rifle from around his shoulder. “Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage shows that the sling of the rifle got stuck in his cap, which caused him to drop the rifle. As it hit the ground, two rounds went off, and he took both the bullets in the stomach,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone II) Rajiv Jain said. Bakotra was rushed to the JJ Hospital, where he died during treatment late on Wednesday night.

Police officials said that while the rifle will be examined by ballistics experts, prima facie it seems that the safety catch had been set to ‘automatic’ mode, which enables the user to fire a burst of rounds at a single pull of the trigger. Only if the catch is on ‘safe’ mode can the gun cannot fire.

Meanwhile, as reports of Bakotra committing suicide started doing the rounds on Thursday morning, the police, after viewing CCTV footage on Thursday afternoon, clarified that his death was an accident.

“Investigations have not thrown up any indications of foul play.

426,2020/01/24,Syedna donates seed balls to re-green Kenya,"The Dawoodi Bohra community’s spiritual leader, Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin, who celebrated his 76th birthday as per the Islamic calendar on December 17, 2019, has donated 76,000 seed balls to Kenya to mark the occasion. The Syedna celebrates his birthday on the birthday of his father and predecessor, Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin.

Kenya has large areas of land in need of reforestation and the Syedna’s donation may help grow over 35,000 trees of native species. The seed balls, which were donated last week, will be planted in southern Kenya near Amboseli National Park — which is known for its elephant herds and beautiful views of Mount Kilimanjaro — and near the town of Kibwezi. The seed balls will be scattered by the traditional Maasai warriors under the supervision of Lion Guardians, a conservation organisation.

The seed is placed in a ball of charcoal dust mixed with nutritious binders. The biochar coating protects the seed from predators such as birds, rodents and insects, and extreme temperature until the rains arrive. It is believed that direct seeding reduces transplantation shock and helps young trees grow stronger roots, which in turn helps them grow into stronger trees.

“Over the years, Kenya has seen a huge loss of indigenous species of trees, causing environmental damage,” said Teddy Kinyanjui, co-founder of Seedballs Kenya, which has pioneered a method of producing seed balls in large numbers for low-cost and efficient reintroduction of trees and grass species into degraded areas. Mr. Kinyanjui said a seed ball costs one Kenyan shilling, which is less than a rupee. “The key is to have seeds of native species. Our seeds are tested at 40%-60% germination rate by the Kenya Forest Research Institute,” he said.

Reviving a river

The east Africa region has more than 10,000 Dawoodi Bohras. Kenya has over 5,500 Dawoodi Bohras mostly concentrated in Nairobi and Mombasa. A community member said their religious leader had donated 60,000 seed balls a few months ago and he decided to donate another 76,000 to mark his 76th birthday. “Besides distributing seed balls to increase afforestation, the Dawoodi Bohra community of Nairobi and students of Aljamea-tus-Saifiyah have started a programme to revive the choked Mbagathi river. The clean-up began as part of the celebrations of the 76th birthday,” the community member said. The clean-up drive was followed by scattering of seed balls along the river.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/b5g5hu/article30638137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMBOHRACOMMUNITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/syedna-donates-seed-balls-to-re-green-kenya/article30638140.ece
427,2020/01/24,Six held for stabbing man in broad daylight,"The Ulhasnagar police have arrested six people who allegedly stabbed a man to death in broad daylight in the bustling firecracker market on Tuesday. The accused, who had fled the area, were picked up from different parts of the State and arrested within 24 hours of the offence being reported.

According to the police, the victim, Prakash Bhoir, was on his way home with three friends when the accused accosted him, around 2 p.m. on Tuesday. They allegedly stabbed and slashed at him multiple times, before fleeing the scene. Bhoir was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was declared dead before admission. The police registered a case of murder against unidentified persons and initiated investigations.

“Inquiries with Bhoir’s friends and relatives indicated he had been involved in a feud with a local resident named Naresh Chavan. We checked on his whereabouts and found him to be missing since the offence,” an officer with the Ulhasnagar police station said.

The officer said using cellular location mapping and with the help of local informants, the investigating team traced Mr. Chavan to Nashik and picked him up for questioning.

“Preliminary questioning confirmed his involvement in the crime, and based on it we picked up the other five accused from various parts of Nashik and Dhule with assistance from the local police,” the officer said.

Mr. Chavan and the other accused — Raju Kanojia, Yogesh Lad, Anikesh Shirsath, Rahul Kanojia and Hatik Bhivsane — were brought to Ulhasnagar and arrested on Wednesday evening. They were charged with murder under the Indian Penal Code and produced in court, after which they were remanded in police custody till January 30.

“Bhoir had assaulted Mr. Chavan’s nephew a couple of months ago over an argument, and relations had soured between them since then. Investigations so far indicate that the murder was an outcome of the same feud. We are finding out whether anyone else was also involved in the murder,” Assistant Commissioner of Police D.D. Tele, Ulhasnagar division, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/six-held-for-stabbing-man-in-broad-daylight/article30638114.ece
428,2020/01/24,"‘No record of people killed, arrested in U.P. violence’","Social activists from Uttar Pradesh on Thursday narrated eyewitness accounts of the State police’s atrocities against protesters demanding the withdrawal of the Citizenship Amendment Act, and National Register of Citizens, and condemning the attacks on students in universities across the country.

The activists were in Mumbai to attend a meeting organised by the People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL), Maharashtra, at St. Peter’s Church in Bandra.

Protests erupted in the northern State following the brutal assault on students of Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University on December 19.

Arundhati Dhuru, a member of the National Alliance for People’s Movements, recalled the sequence of events at one such protest. The demonstration began at 3 p.m., and just when the protesters started to disperse, a bunch of masked men parked empty buses around them, she said. “They barged in and started hitting the protesters. The worst part was that the police let them in and the atmosphere became chaotic as the protesters started running and the police started firing. Since then, the State government has not put an end to this violence. They are burning men’s beards stating their beards define their identity. The police has still not given a report of the bullets that hit the victims. We still don’t know the exact number of people killed and arrested,” Ms. Dhuru said.

Activist Medha Patkar said if the citizens of India do not stand against those acting against the Constitution, they will have to end up proving their citizenship to the government.

Ms. Patkar said right-wing politicians and capitalists are a danger to the country and the government is slowly and steadily making the law-making process undemocratic. “It is time for us to adopt a particular ideology and then proceed. We should have realised and stopped this regime when they decided to organise a rath yatra to Ayodhya. We have let this toxic party come to power by not putting a stop to it at the right time,” she said.

Faizal Khan, a member of Khudai Khidadgar, said representatives of regional news media were only enjoying the show and manipulating the situation. “The innocent people killed in Uttar Pradesh did not even get a proper burial. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has effectively shown the dirty side of Hinduism and given a bad name to the religion,” Mr. Khan said.

Uncertain future

Several others who witnessed the violence said this was the first time citizens had been at the receiving end of such extreme violence. Richa Singh, a member of Sangtin Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, said, “Similar protests are on in cities like Delhi, but the protesters are unsure of what will happen next — whether they will be arrested, assaulted or shot dead.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/h6im2t/article30638037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMPUCL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-record-of-people-killed-arrested-in-up-violence/article30638038.ece
429,2020/01/24,Memories in a bowl,"It seems like another old but renovated Goan house. There’s a vintage bike at the entrance. A dog bounds about playfully. A sense of laziness permeates the afternoon air. A tiled path leads into a garden area and an open balcony. There are tables and chairs laid out in both spaces. An attendant sits on a sofa, knitting.

It may seem like a place of idyll, yet this place on a busy road in Anjuna holds memories within its folds. As of December 2019, this house became Edible Archives, a restaurant and research centre with the goal of championing ingredients. The subject has always fascinated chef Anumitra Dostidar Ghosh.

The 37-year-old used her research experience gained while doing a PhD in cognitive linguistics to focus on exploring ingredients. She and her partner, writer Shalini Krishnan spent three years travelling across India seeking out lesser-known indigenous rice varieties and documenting them. The resultant findings became the Edible Archives project. These heritage rice varieties became sensory exhibits (think meal bowls) at Kochi Muziris Biennale 2018-19.

Shared experiments

After a successful run in Kochi where the duo served different rice varieties paired with dishes across South Asian cuisine, Edible Archives moved to Goa. “We wanted a base for our research, a space to experiment and share our results with people,” says Ghosh, adding that she always wanted to settle down in Goa.

The restaurant feels like the backyard of someone’s home, familiar and comfortable. The seating is outdoor, wooden tables and wicker chairs. The restaurant works with local potters to source their tableware: from bottles of water to serving bowls and plates. They even have crocheted coasters.

This is no Goan food menu though there are familiar elements: kokum, sausages, sannas, Moira bananas, and cashew nuts. The most intriguing spice, the tephal (or teppal) makes its peppery way into a Teppal Vodka Collins (₹450), giving the drink a refreshing citrusy kick. Part of Ghosh’s menu changes almost every week, driven by what’s available. “The menu is about the freshest things available, and the dry things we can carry easily. The dishes let the ingredients shine,” she says. The offering bears influence from all the places and people Ghosh has worked with: Chinese, Japanese, French, Italian, Bengali and Goan.

For a Goan, the menu is intriguing. The food isn’t predictable and the ingredients demand attention, and thought. Take the Pan Seared Leppo (₹280). This popular fish is typically enjoyed in a vibrant curry or fried till the bones are crispy enough to eat. Ghosh turns it on its head, serving the fish whole with the barest of searing, the pink meat soaked in lemon juice and garlic. Another popular item gives the Goan long beans, and green brinjal, a Northern Chinese touch. Shanxi-style brinjal and long beans (₹250) is a stir fry, dusted with cashew nuts, garlic and chillies. “I ate this dish in China,” says Ghosh. “When I came to Goa and saw these ingredients, it intrigued that memory of mine. I decided to pick the ingredients from here and treat them differently. It’s now become a bestseller.” Goan and Bengali food find the perfect partnership in the piquant Mustard Coconut Prawns with Sannas (₹450). The pillowy sannas are typically eaten with a spicy sorpotel but, here, their sweetness is a balm to the pungent prawns.

All in one

Show a Goan a thali that doesn’t have fish and they will look at you in surprise. Yet, the Edibale Archives’ thali – essentially a bowl – is polished off within minutes. The Bowl of the Week (veg, ₹300), has raja mudi rice from Karnataka, yellow dal, raw papaya stir fried with coconut, a mushy raw banana and sweet potato kofta, a tangy Sri Lankan pickle, and grilled aubergine with dill. On their own, they each pack a bold punch but, the rice melds the flavours together well.

Another surprise for the Goans is the dessert. Moira bananas are a beloved variant of the fruit, typically eaten steamed, roasted, fried, or cooked with a sugar syrup. Here, Ghosh caramelises banana slices, heightening their sweetness. There’s warmth from the toasted pistachios, and ice cream – creamy and not rich – for relief from the sweet. The Caramelised Moira Plantains with Pistachios and Ice cream (₹350) does justice to every ingredient on the plate. It’s a dish that highlights what can be done with good produce.

Ghosh is very particular about her ingredients. She buys fish, produce and other ingredients herself, visiting markets and jetties daily. She uses old equipment like an ICMIC charcoal cooker, stone grinders and cast iron utensils. The plan is to buy less and finish everything; food waste goes into compost. They will soon start a permaculture garden. “This is not just a restaurant,” she says.

430,2020/01/24,When in Kolkata...,"When Delhi was at its foggiest best, I was in Kolkata, soaking in its sun and food. One breezy day, my Kolkata friends suggested that we visit a restaurant called Saz. The choice was between the American-continental fare there, and a Bengali meal at Bhaja Hari Manna. I voted for the former (though I must say I quite like the latter, too).

Saz is in Fort Knox, a small mall that earlier sold gold on Camac Street. The restaurant is on the top floor, and you get a panoramic view of the city from the windows that line the expansive hall. It is quite a popular place — going by the large groups of youngsters coming and going — and the loud music that played while we were there.

The menu is the kind that makes you want to start nibbling on your napkin. It included appetisers (pan-seared scallops, duck and pomegranate salad), sandwiches (smoked salmon, steak sandwich, chicken and avocado), pizzas (quattro formaggio, Goan chorizo), burgers (beetroot and goat cheese, tenderloin) and grills and mains (summer green vegetables on truffle mash, jambalaya, pan-seared Norwegian salmon, pork ribs et al).

I asked for my favourite: a Tenderloin Steak (₹1100). The others asked for the Classic Fish and Chips (₹ 650), Bangers on Mash (₹ 675), Spaghetti Aglio Olio (₹ 550), Thin Crust Pizza with Spinach and Artichokes (₹ 500), and Churros and Chocolate Dip (₹ 350).

My steak came with grilled bokchoy, beetroot and black pepper mash. I had asked for a rare-medium steak, but by the time it came to the table, it was well done. I enjoyed it, but would certainly have liked it rare.

My friend’s pork bangers with mash — with pan jus, mustard onion relish and baby greens — were delicious (I had a quick bite). The other friend didn't enjoy her fried fish with hand-cut fries and tartar sauce. She said the coating was crisp, but the fish was bland and the fries smelt of oil.

Two others shared the pizza, which was topped with caramelized onions, goat cheese and a balsamic glaze. They found it delicious, and gobbled it up before I could go anywhere there. The spaghetti aglio olio looked unfortunately like Chinese noodles. The pasta, I am told was dry, and a little too hot for our friend.

But what took the cake — or the pudding — were the churros, which were fresh, so they were soft and warm. There was a rich, creamy chocolate sauce, with a cinnamon dust and almond flakes, to go with it. Simply divine. We dipped our churros into the sauce, looked at the city below us and the young men and women around us, and called it a day.

What’s really nice about Saz is how it welcomes its diners. The very friendly — and helpful — servers guided us through the menu, and took care of each of our demands (which included shutting windows, and lowering the volume of the music).

I think the prices are rather steep for Kolkata, and I worried that the friend who had taken us out might have had to pawn her jewellery. But it was a nice day: sunny and cheerful, and the food, overall, wasn’t bad. I thought of cold, foggy and steak-less Delhi, and everything seemed even nicer. Time I planned another trip to Kolkata.

431,2020/01/24,Watch while your breakfast is put together at this pop-up in Kochi,"As George Mathew places a concave coupe plate bearing bangers and mash on the table, he explains what went into this typically British dish.

It features spiced pork sausages, sourced from Bengaluru, served on a bed of mashed potatoes, over which George ladles velvety onion gravy. The dish is one of many on a old-school Continental menu he has curated for his two-weekend pop-up at ‘Luv It Fresh’ in Jawahar Nagar.

The meal comes with 10 options for breakfast and brunch. Some are huge such as the ‘Full Monty’ — sausage, bacon, toasted bread, sautéed mushrooms, baked beans, grilled tomatoes, fried egg, orange juice with choice of tea or coffee. Then there’s the equally hearty ‘French Toast Breakfast Meal’, with pancakes, pork sausages, bacon, roast potatoes, fried eggs, fruit and a choice of tea or coffee. He also plates up minimal platters, such as ‘David’, featuring cocktail sausages and scrambled eggs in a cone. There are beef cutlets too.

As I watch, he assembles the dish — mashing potatoes and frying the blanched sausages. It is a very homely feeling, talking to the chef as your food gets done.

A pop-up in this format is a first for George. He has a cloud kitchen, The Bean Leaf, which serves naadan food such as cheemeen chor (prawn rice), meen moily, kozhuva (anchovy) fry and pothichor (a Kerala meal packed in banana leaf).

He also runs a concept kitchen, called Fearless Flavours (FF). One of his concepts is ‘George At Home’, where he hosts guests at his home in Kakkanad. FF is inspired by Curtis Stone’s Food Network show, Take Home Chef in which Stone approaches a shopper in a supermarket and offers to cook a meal for them at their house. George calls this “a tiny version of Take Home Chef.”

He also cooks at home, has people over often and is open to cooking for others in their kitchens. He says learnt everything he knows about food by trial and error, watching cookery shows on television. Working in the airline industry in Qatar, his job profile had nothing to do with cooking; it was a hobby. That is until a health scare, in 2013, gave him free time to surf television channels. Diners, Drive-ins and Dives by Guy Fieri got him hooked and he started cooking for friends over the weekend.

“I loved to cook. It was also something to keep me going,” says the 48 year-old, whose health issues, at the time, were taking a toll on him. He used the time cooking for larger groups, devouring anything on food – reading up, watching television shows and even attending a week-long course at Opal by Gordon Ramsay at St. Regis, Doha.

Hailing from a family of doctors, he calls himself the black sheep of the family. Right now, he says he is playing to his strengths with this unique cooking-on-demand format. Ultimately, he wants to introduce a fresh culture of dining out, cooking and eating in Kochi, which is what this pop-up aims to do. “The aim is to cook these continental dishes in an interactive way. It not only allows you to explain a dish better, but also helps them understand the kind of produce used, and methods of cooking.” He adds that with this style of pop-up, personalisation is key: “What makes it better for me is that the dishes are familiar, and I can meet their tastes.”

George’s next round of pop-ups will be on January 25 and 26; open from 7.30 am to 12 pm.

432,2020/01/24,Two friends script an organic success story,"A request for organic mangoes put college mates S Balaji and P Balathandayuthabani on the road to creating an internet-based ecosystem of nature-friendly food items based out of suburban Tiruchi. With over 80,000 followers on its Facebook page, and domestic and foreign business of approximately ₹15 lakh per month through its website, B&B Organics aims to support both traditional farming and healthy eating.

“We take a lot of interest in researching our mobile phones, and compare their various features before we pick one. But surprisingly, we aren’t bothered by where our food is coming from, and what it is doing to our bodies and the Earth,” says Balathandayuthabani, or Bala as he prefers to be known. “We decided to concentrate on organic products to encourage our farmers to revive traditional agriculture and also create awareness among customers about healthy food.”

Eco-friendly ethos

Bala, 33, who is from Pudukottai and Balaji, 27, from Dharmapuri, graduated in Horticulture (four years apart) from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in Coimbatore. Bala followed up his Masters with a doctorate in Environmental Sciences from Sweden, where his thesis helped him to understand organic farming in greater detail.

“After studying Horticulture, both of us were sure that we wanted to run a business together with an eco-friendly ethos,” says Balaji, who trained under a leading consultant for large farms after graduation. “We floated a few ideas, but clearly we weren’t cut out for business, and many projects remained on paper,” he laughs.

It was a request for organic mangoes from Bala’s elder brother, a doctor, that sprouted the idea for an online enterprise in food items free of chemicals. B&B Organics was founded in 2016.

“We had begun to realise that organic was the future of food consumption and like many others, we were concerned about the growing chemical inputs in our food chain.

“We started out from a small room four years ago, and from then until today, in our custom-built premises on Lalgudi Main Road, the learning is still on,” says Balaji.

Social enterprise

The duo’s field surveys across Tamil Nadu revealed that only around 15% of farmers carried out organic farming in the State, and of this, 5% alone were into traditional agriculture. “Most of the growth has been caused by non-resident Indians who have returned home to establish integrated organic farms in the past 10 years,” says Balaji.

Among the first lessons Bala and Balaji learned, was not to rely on just feedback from friends to expand their business.

“While being initially supportive of our products, most of them still preferred their usual branded groceries, mainly due to the price factor,” says Bala.

Organic products are costlier due to the smaller number of farmers engaged in this sector and also because of the absence of significant government support, says the duo.

The company sources its cereals and grains from 600 farmers in the region and allows them to fix the price of their products. It devotes 2.5% of each sale to promote awareness about natural farming, sparrow conservation and planting of native trees.

“When we started, we had just five farmers doing traditional crops. Now there are over 100 farmers who have followed them, after seeing the profits of organic farming,” says Bala. “Since our products are pesticide-free, we keep limited amounts on stock, to avoid natural spoilage. Our farmers are given the inventory requirements well ahead, to help them plan their planting schedule.”

Name it right Classification makes all the difference when it comes to traditional rice, says Bala of B&B Organics. “Abroad, organic rice is simply split into two categories: black and red. But here in India, we have several varieties in not just black or red, but also brown, white and aromatic rice,” he says. “Though they look similar, each type has a unique nutrition profile.”

Siddha medicine advocates different types of rice at different times according to the age and health requirements of a person, which could explain the low incidence of diseases like diabetes and cancer in the olden days, he says.

Email newsletters also educate the customer about products and healthful choices. “Sometimes we also put the farmer directly in touch with customers, if they have doubts about how to prepare a food grain, so that we can make it an interactive process,” says Bala.

Stamps of approval

Certification is the other aspect that most traditional farmers ignore. “We have made it mandatory for all the growers and suppliers on our roster to be approved by India Organic and the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), because certification is essential for export as well,” says Balaji. All the products are tested at a leading private laboratory based in Haryana before they are approved for sale.

And instead of competing with major corporates producing organic products, B&B has created a roster of traditional southern Indian foods (raw and processed) that are no longer in vogue.

Among the 200 items (cereals, grains, recipe mixes, noodles, spices, oils and snacks) that they sell today, at least 100 are what may be called ‘vanished’ foods like Pani Varagu (Proso Millet) flour, and Bamboo Rice, a short-grain white rice infused with bamboo juice. Each food item is accompanied by an explainer on its health benefits.

“In 2016, after several months of losses, during which my mother bailed us out by buying our unsold stock, business started looking up after we got good response from a customer in Mumbai to our coconut oil. The positive word-of-mouth helped our customer base to grow, more than any targeted advertising campaign would have done,” says Bala.

Up next, are innovations such as oil derived from the milk of organically grown coconuts.

“Globally, people are getting interested in knowing more about the origin of their food, and how it gets to their plate. It’s time for Indian consumers to examine their diet more carefully,” says Balaji.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/xrnwwv/article30643952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TYMPBampBBALAJI,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/tiruchi-based-online-organic-food-enterprise-shows-the-importance-of-making-healthy-choices/article30643954.ece
433,2020/01/24,I always start from history and go forward: Marco Stabile,"Born at Pontedera in Tuscany in 1973, Marco Stabile has carved a name for himself as a chef who re-imagines traditional Italian dishes with modern techniques. After working in several restaurants, he honed his skill at the two Michelin-star Alforno. In 2005, he opened his own restaurant in Florence, Ora d’Aria, and in 2011, the restaurant was awarded its first Michelin star.

The genial chef, who is in Bengaluru for a six-day pop-up at Caprese, Shangri – La Hotel till January 26, sits down for a chat with MetroPlus.

Excerpts:

How did you start out on your journey of becoming a chef?

As a child, I decided I like to help my mother in the kitchen because I could not play football. In Italy, everybody played football. And because my mother had four children, she cooked a lot and it was different every day. Then I chose to go to a culinary school and started in a trattoria. I started to work with a lot of covers and very small staff so I learned to cook fast (laughs). I met good teachers of classic traditional Tuscan cooking who taught me the traditions. I learned my tradition where I was born but also learnt Florence gastronomy. I never forget the tradition when making a new dish. I always start from my history and then I go forward. I worked in a two Michelin star restaurant (also in Tuscany) Alforno and there I learnt elegant presentation. After this, we have the taste and that starts in the ingredients. So, another thing that I learnt is to choose ingredients with passion. Go to the farm to see how they grow, go to the cheesemaker to see how they make cheese... Because after this, when we put a dish on the table, we tell the story to the guest with a dish.

Not just pizza and pasta We don’t do just simple dishes. One wrong thing is that when we do some dish that is more complicated, people say it is French cooking. No. For example, lasagna is complicated to do very well.

We love risotto and pasta al dente. We are not just spaghetti and pizza. And we are not just tomato and mozzarella. People always search for three things: mozzarella, pasta pomodoro (pasta with tomato), which is for a child. And bolognese. Bolognese is just in Bologna. In Florence, we don’t do bolognese.

Now, in Italy we do pasta arrabiata but just in pizzerias. Arrabiata is just a modern invention. And we don’t have alfredo. Nobody eats alfredo pasta.

In Italy, pasta an important dish. It is not the main dish, but we don't have lunch or dinner without pasta.

You have stated that travel is important for a chef. Can you elaborate on that?

It is important to try other cultures and to be curious. Curiosity moves the world. If you are not curious, you don’t say anything. Because you taste (the dish) and you say ‘okay’ (shrugs). But if you are curious, you taste it and you want to know how they do this. You go to see, to learn, to have it become part of you. Also, sometimes, you can use something else to make the dish better. This is very interesting, because sometimes I try a very old Tuscan recipe and it is missing something. I need a very fresh note so maybe I put lemongrass. We don’t have lemongrass in Italy, you understand. You have it in India, in Thailand…

There seems to be an interesting story behind the name of your restaurant. Can you tell us what it is?

When we opened the restaurant in 2005, it was situated in front of a prison. In a prison, the only nice thing is, for one hour a day you go outside the cell, look at the sky and breathe fresh air. Ora d’Aria (Hour of Air) is the name of the restaurant. We want to tell where we were but in a positive way. In Ora d’Aria, you can relax and take your time and forget your normal life for one or two hours. In 2010, we moved the restaurant near the most famous museum in Florence. Because the walls are very thick and old, you can’t even use your cellphone in the restaurant.

What are the future plans for the restaurant? Another Michelin star perhaps?

It is a nice question because I am changing a lot of things in the restaurant (laughs). I started in December and we finish around May. We have the same idea that guests must feel good but we are changing the way of presentation. Also I am going to take very very, very, very old recipes (500 years and older); and I am doing this with people who study gastronomy. And I will mix this with future techniques (laughs). Maybe I want to work on a second Michelin star with these changes. I have very few seats (a total of 30) and I need to increase them. But also, satisfaction is very important for me. Increase the quality, not just the price.

What are some of the staples of Tuscan cuisine?

We have a lot of dishes with bread. As a lot of people are involved in agriculture, they prepare bread on Sunday for the whole week. In Tuscany, the bread has no salt. So, in three days, it becomes hard. For that reason, we invented a lot of recipes. Panzanella, pappa al pomodoro, ribollita (cabbage bean soup)… Without bread, we don’t eat. In November every year, we have new olive oil. We love to do bruschetta with the new oil on top. When it is new, olive oil is very bitter and very spicy. We become crazy for this.

434,2020/01/24,This Goan restaurant cooks with Indian heritage ingredients,"About 50 metres from Swami Dayananda Saraswati’s ancestral home in Tamil Nadu’s Manjakkudi, in the foyer of a beautiful home that also plays host to his Memorial, Chef Anumitra Ghosh Dastidar and Shalini Krishan of the Edible Archives rustled up a simple, flavourful dish called radish and rice. They also traced the birth of their brand, Edible Archives, and the values with which they intend to raise their baby.

Radish and rice was a marriage of equals; it placed prominence on the vegetable and allowed the rice — Bengal’s gobindo bhog, sourced from their farm in Manjakkudi — to layer it with crunch, taste and texture. Ginger, green chillies and cumin paste lent it a freshness of flavour and a hint of spice.

The thing about Edible Archives is that it is neither about fusion in cuisine nor experiments for the sake of it. It is a story of creating and nurturing a collective food consciousness — of sorts. By becoming aware of every small thing that you eat, you, in a sense, become a bit more aware of your own self.

The heart of Edible Archives is a month-and-a-half-old restaurant — currently a 36-seater — housed in the cusp of Assagao and Anjuna in North Goa. Located strategically in the courtyard of a large old Portuguese home, it celebrates all things indigenous.

Anumitra, who holds a doctorate in Cognitive Linguistics, grew up in a rice-eating household. But it was during her stint with chefs from around the globe that she discovered how passionate and particular they are about ingredients. “The idea to pursue a project like Edible Archives also stemmed from my own interest to look at the diversity we had in India, to draw upon memories to create food that was locally sourced and seasonal, and to make it in a way that was lived in memory rather than in what is written.”

Shalini worked as an editor at leading publishing houses before deciding that to actually appreciate something in its entirety, you have to live the process. She says people need to be educated on the premise of “ingredient-driven” restaurants.

At Edible Archives, there is a seasonal menu — currently a winter menu until the sun blooms in March — and a couple of dishes that change every three days or so.

Amongst the most sought-after is the Edible Archive bowl, an innovative showcase of creativity and abstraction. The day Shalini and Anumitra left, the bowl comprised thavala kannan rice (a rustic, red rice from Kerala), beetroot stir-fried in Sri Lankan style, a koftaof mustard greens, raw banana and sweet potato, a begun (brinjal) bhaja for the vegetarians and a sardine fry for those who love their seafood, with a spicy pickle made of carrot and raw papaya for the zing.

Sourcing ingredients directly from farmers across the country and spending time with them, has allowed for food creation to become a real, participative experience that is cultural, anthropological and sociological. One laden with seasonal flavours and coated with memories aplenty.

Says Shalini, “I talk to them, and steer them to try different types of rice they are perhaps not familiar with, in the hope that they engage with diversity and inherit lived memories.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/vbqb4i/article30640950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MPEdibleArchivesbowljpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/this-goa-restaurant-cooks-with-indian-heritage-ingredients/article30640955.ece

436,2020/01/24,Staying woke in Davos,"If it is a nightmare to reach and hundreds of protestors are blocking the road, you can bet it is the World Economic Forum in Davos. Almost everyone has a horror story about the commute from Zurich — whether it is the endless train changes, the tedious traffic or the chopper not being available because a guy with a bigger bank balance bullied his way into your booking. But, on the bright side, the weather did not play spoilsport. In years past I’ve braved snowstorms and terrible roads, but this year the weather was mild — I guess climate change is real!

The 2,500 delegates, 426 speakers, 147 sessions, 100 billionaires, 500 helicopters hovering over this small Alpine town and Donald Trump en famille made for a heady mix at WEF’s 50th anniversary in 2020. I haven’t been around for 50 years, but in the past five years I’ve been coming, it has always been intensely hectic and fun. I mean, what’s not to like about fondue and free Champagne?

But, more seriously, Tina Brown, the media icon with whom I work, hosts an annual Women of Impact dinner. That’s what brings me here. This year we had the International Monetary Fund head, Kristalina Georgieva, and Iranian activist, Masih Alinejad, speak at dinner. Ivanka Trump showed up; she had worked with Kristalina on women’s economic empowerment when the latter was at the World Bank. Ivanka is tall, skinny and very friendly, but what really struck me was her skin, which is so luminous I was dying to ask her what creams she uses. The only other person whose face I’ve seen look as good is Delhi-based art collector, Shalini Passi. I messaged her later to tell her as much.

Kristalina didn’t just talk of macroeconomic issues, she also spoke about how she awoke to gender discrimination after age 40 and how growing up under communism in her native Bulgaria gave her first-hand experience of its evils. Masih, whose book, The Wind in My Hair, talks about her fight for freedom in Iran, faces death threats. Her brother was arrested in September by the regime. She sang impromptu on stage after she told us that women in Iran do not have the right to sing solo. These are the moments that stay with you long after you leave Davos.

I missed seeing more of my ultimate fashionista friend, Natasha Poonawalla, whose clothes always delight in Davos. She was off in Paris for a fancy LVMH dinner and so was arriving slightly later in the week. That said, those years of spotting extravagant furs and insane boots seem to have passed — everyone is woke to sustainability. Given the downbeat IMF outlook for global economic growth this year, it is probably appropriate to not sport over-the-top fashion.

Davos is all about clichés: be it the business jargon, buzzwords or the types of people who attend (except me, of course!). Tina summed it up best. “It is all about FOMO on black ice,” she said on a panel on Wednesday, explaining how people keep rushing from one thing to another because they don’t want to feel left out. However, given the bread and cheese diet on which I exist here, it is a good thing I walk so much. It is also the best way to bump into people. Was that David Cameron? Was that Will.i.Am? Was that Kamal Nath? When I overheard a middle-aged Indian man gush over how he rode up in an elevator with Deepika Padukone, I was pretty sure his year was made. I guess that’s what Davos is about — it may not solve big world problems, but it does give attendees ample anecdotes to take back home.

437,2020/01/24,From the ground up: in conversation with building systems expert K.P. Jayabhanu,"A well-known consultant in building systems and bio-mass processing, KP Jayabhanu has been a part of several national projects in his career spanning over 55 years. His notable stints were at Andaman Timber Industries in Kolkata, NRK Infrastructure in Chennai, National Bamboo Mission, and he has also served as a senior consultant for international agencies.

He lets us in on how the construction industry has evolved in the country, and his work with wood and technologies created for developing countries.

How has the Indian construction industry evolved?

Earlier, laterite and clay bricks, clay hollow blocks and clay tiles were common, but such construction could be carried out only in places where the material was available. The burnt clay brick was extensively utilised, but restrictions on clay mining imposed by the government and the raw material’s non-availability forced people to adopt building systems dependent on cement and related products. The cost-strength ratio of such products was favourable and soon, cement became the dominant building material.

As for interiors, cement hollow blocks and cement-based panels like aerated cement boards and cement bonded particle boards became popular. For a long time, plywood was considered a sustainable resource and was extensively featured in interiors. However, logging restrictions and non-availability of logs in many areas lead to the entry of plantation wood and residue material like rubber wood, coconut wood etc. in the form of engineered wood products.

Tell us about your work in establishing the large-scale use of rubber wood, coconut wood and selected plantation timber in Kerala.

In 2000, I established a unit in Thalassery to process rubber wood, which is a plantation residue. The company had the capacity to process forest residues, lops and tops (branches) and other monocots like coconut wood and palm wood.

The products offered were processed RSKD (Rough Sawn Kiln Dried) scantlings, finger-jointed laminated beams and sections, and large edge-glued panels. The plant was also equipped to produce edge-glued panel parquet flooring finished with UV lacquer and ready to install staircases. Turned components like balusters and columns were also produced by the company.

Further, I introduced engineered hollow columns to be used as beams and columns which could be made load bearing by inserting steel reinforcement and concrete inside the hollows. The unit closed in 2007, but the technologies developed are still in use by smaller companies and government agencies.

Given the large-scale felling of trees happening today, is wood considered an eco-friendly construction material?

Earlier, timber from the natural forest was considered a sustainable material. The over-exploitation of our forests changed the status of timber and strict controls were imposed on felling in forests. However, plantations were developed in many regions and this timber was processed using appropriate engineering technology.

Over time, such sources of timber attained the ‘sustainable’ status. After several risk assessments, a commercially viable development in the housing sector evolved wherein the low floor is built with masonry or concrete panels and the upper floors use wooden panels.

Tell us a little bit about the flexible building system you developed in Indonesia.

Under my guidance, a large hollow core concrete panel system was developed in Indonesia (between 1976-82). This was the first total building system created from the developing world. Based on this technology, several homes were built in the country’s far east regions.

As this required the deployment of heavy-duty cranes, it was not the ideal solution for developing countries, especially in rural areas. Therefore, it was necessary to develop a building system that used smaller panels, which could be installed easily.

A prototype was developed in the suburbs of Chennai in early 2008, but this building system hasn’t yet been employed for commercial use.

Please list the top materials popular in pre-fabricated and affordable housing projects

Apart from solid wood and wood-based panels, here are a few other materials used:

l Processed timber like plywood, wood-based particle

boards, and Oriented strand boards

l Cement-based panels like cement bonded particle boards, aerated cement panels, fiber cement boards and wood polymer composite products (WPC)

l Concrete panels of various configurations like hollow core panel, solid wood concrete panel and hollow cement blocks

l Engineered plantation wood-based panels, engineered solid hollow columns and beams

l Aerated cement panels, cement bonded particle boards

l Fiber cement products and fiber cement roof panels and tiles

l Concrete solid hollow core panels, polymer concrete products and sandwiched metal panels

l Aluminium products like roof sheets

In your opinion, what is ailing India’s housing and construction industry?

The dominant factor negatively impacting the country’s sector is outdated technology which involves unprotected labour force, wrong designs and poor engineering. Currently, a majority of structures are not built to resist even minor earth movement, and natural calamities such as floods.

I notice that engineering inputs such as optimising material usage by pre-stressing are not commonly applied.

The construction industry here needs to develop building systems that incorporate new and appropriate engineering techniques and use available, sustainable raw materials.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/1gorop/article30641932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Wooden-Spiral-Stairs-1-2,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/in-conversation-with-building-systems-expert-kp-jayabhanu-of-chennai-based-alignment-technologies/article30641934.ece
438,2020/01/24,‘U.T. one of the most eco-friendly destinations’,"The industrial policy’s thrust on non-polluting industries and the wholesome support of organic farming are among the policy measures that have made Puducherry one of the most eco-friendly destinations in the country, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said.

Addressing a two-day International Conference on Environmental, Agricultural, Chemical and Biological sciences (ICEACBS 2020) hosted by the Pondicherry Institute of Agricultural Sciences with support of State Murray University, Kentucky, U.S., Mr. Narayanasamy said the government had resolved not to permit polluting industries in the U.T. as part of environment protection advocacy.

The event was supported by Centre for Environment and Agricultural Development (CEAD) and Voice of Indian Concern for the Environment.

Clear directions

The government had also issued clear directions to hospitals to adhere to safe disposal of biological waste, the Chief Minister said. On the agriculture front, the government was promoting organic farming in a big way, Mr. Narayanasamy said.

The U.T. was one of the few places in the country, if not the only one, where apart from loan waivers, farmers were given a subsidy of ₹10,000 per acre of land and ₹25,000 per hectare through a central government scheme, he said.

According to Mr. Narayanasamy, the government’s priority was focused on developing tourism infrastructure.

439,2020/01/24,What Quique Setien brings to Barcelona,"“I only guarantee one thing when I take over a new club: that we play good football,” Quique Setien said when he was presented as Barcelona’s new manager last week. “I don’t have winners’ medals or a huge CV, just a commitment to an idea.”

Fortunately for Setien, his idea of interpreting the game and Barcelona’s football philosophy share a common source: Johan Cruyff, one of the most influential figures in the sport’s history and the man credited with turning Barcelona’s fortunes around during his tenure as coach/manager between 1988 and 1996.

Setien was a technically proficient midfielder at Racing Santander when he encountered Cruyff’s Barcelona. “You played against them, and you spent the whole match running after the ball,” Setien wrote in The Coaches’ Voice. “I said to myself: ‘This is what I like. I would like to … know why this is happening.’ How can you get a team to have the ball permanently, so that the opponent is running after it for the whole match? From then on, I started to make sense of what I had felt through my career… To understand what I wanted … when I became a coach. I wanted the ball.”

It was the success Setien had in implementing this philosophy at Las Palmas and Real Betis that got him on the shortlist for the job once Barcelona’s top brass had decided to sack Ernesto Valverde. According to Spanish media reports, there was a growing feeling among the club’s movers and shakers that the team had stagnated. Despite back-to-back LaLiga triumphs, it was felt that the side wasn’t playing the eye-catching football it’s famous for. The Champions League defeats to Roma and Liverpool were seen as evidence that Valverde couldn’t take the club to the next level.

The 61-year-old Setien has been tasked with restoring Barcelona’s identity as a side that dominates the ball, dismantling the opposition with slick passing and intelligent movement. Does he have what it takes to do this? He certainly has shown the ability to get his teams to play any side off the park — his Real Betis outfit bossed Barcelona at Camp Nou and Real Madrid at the Bernabeu last season. A lot of the football Betis played in those wins against Spain’s most expensively assembled sides — 4-3 over Barca, 2-0 over Real — was dazzling.

What’s more, Setien managed this with footballers who aren’t as gifted technically or been trained in this philosophy for as long as Barcelona’s.

Coaching a progressive style is a challenge even at the big clubs. Jose Mourinho, for instance, reasoned that football is won by the side which makes fewer mistakes: since the side with the ball was more likely to make a mistake (“whoever has the ball has fear”), it made sense to “renounce possession” and “reduce the possibility of making a mistake”. So, for Setien to have had success coaching an attacking, possession-heavy style at clubs that couldn’t afford players with the quality to consistently pull it off says something about his managerial capabilities.

Significantly, the results at Las Palmas and Betis suggest that his coaching made a difference. He took Las Palmas’ reins in 2015 with the side in the drop zone. He guided them to 11th and 14th before leaving. The side was relegated the season after his departure. He took charge of a Betis side that had finished 15th and drove it to sixth in 2017-18! The 18 wins that campaign are a Betis record for a 38-game season. Last season saw a drop in league position, but the side still finished 10th, higher than its average (13th) in the five seasons before him.

Setien’s vision has already excited Barcelona’s players — early reports suggest that they enjoy the creative, energetic training sessions and the manager’s hands-on approach, a change from Valverde’s methods. But craving the ball and having it is only one part of the equation. What the side does when it loses possession is just as important — Setien will face the task of convincing his players to sacrifice themselves for the team and press with high intensity.

How a powerful dressing-room, with many players in their 30s and reportedly not happy being challenged, reacts to being asked to work harder off the ball will determine how successful Setien is. Although he is known for being a charismatic communicator, he hasn’t managed players of this stature before; he can’t afford to lose the dressing room, but he can’t allow the players to dictate terms either.

Setien hasn’t been subjected to the extreme pressure the job at Barcelona exerts: winning trophies isn’t enough; they have to be won in style. Dealing with it at the age of 61 can’t be easy. He will also have to navigate Barcelona’s boardroom politics. With a presidential election scheduled next year, his future is even less certain. But any fan of the beautiful game will hope Setien is given time — because if he gets it right, the football has every chance of being breathtaking.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/g2ybx0/article30646840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25coach1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/what-quique-setien-brings-to-barcelona/article30646841.ece
440,2020/01/24,Firmino nets Liverpool a late winner against Wolves at the Premier League,"Roberto Firmino struck another late winner for Liverpool as Jurgen Klopp’s men opened up a 16-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 2-1 victory at Wolves on Thursday.

The European champion’s now 14-game winning streak in the league seemed set to end as Raul Jimenez cancelled out Jordan Henderson’s early opener.

Liverpool also lost Sadio Mane to a first half injury and was grateful to goalkeeper Alisson Becker for not falling behind in the second half.

However, like crucial victories against Leicester, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace earlier in the campaign, Liverpool left it late to snatch another vital three points in its quest to end a 30-year wait to win the title as Firmino smashed home six minutes from time.

Liverpool, which now has 22 wins in 23 league games this season, also has a game in hand over second-placed Manchester City to come.

Defeat leaves Wolves still six points off the top four in seventh.

Set-pieces have been one of the keys to Liverpool’s success and just like against Manchester United on Sunday, a well-worked corner got the visitor off to a flying start.

Wolves’ attention was taken by the towering presence of Virgil van Dijk and instead it was Henderson who met Trent Alexander-Arnold’s near-post delivery with a header that rebounded onto his shoulder and past goalkeeper Rui Patricio.

Most sides would have been disheartened by that early blow, but Wolves showed why they are contenders for a top-four finish by immediately putting the European champions on the back foot.

Matt Doherty should have levelled from Wolves’ own smart corner routine as the Irish international was perfectly picked out by Ruben Neves but headed wide.

Liverpool then suffered a major blow as Mane pulled up and had to be replaced by Takumi Minamino.

The Senegalese has scored 15 goals this season and could now be a doubt for the first-leg of Liverpool’s Champions League last 16 tie at Atletico Madrid in less than four weeks’ time.

Mane’s absence is unlikely to sway the momentum of the title race, but his presence was missed as Liverpool struggled to regain control in the second half.

Jimenez and Adama Traore were left on the bench when the sides met in late December just two days after Nuno Espirito Santo’s side had come from behind to beat Manchester City and Wolves’ two most dangerous attacking weapons made a huge difference.

Traore had a lucky escape when he conceded possession on the edge of his own box a minute into the second period and was bailed out by a fine Patricio save to parry Mohamed Salah’s driven effort.

However, the Spaniard’s pace was too much for a Liverpool defence that had kept seven consecutive Premier League clean sheets to handle moments later.

Traore’s run down the right pulled van Dijk out of the centre of the defence and his pinpoint cross found Jimenez to bullet home his 20th goal of the season.

That was the first goal Alisson Becker had conceded in the league for two months and the Brazilian had to be at his best to then turn a Traore drive to safety and stand up bravely to block from Jimenez.

Firmino looked to have missed the chance to claim all three points when he fired into Patricio’s legs with just the Portuguese number one to beat.

But he quickly made amends with a thumping finish from Henderson’s pass.

The result: Premier League: Wolves 1 (Jimenez 51) lost to Liverpool 2 (Henderson 8, Firmino 84).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/t2li12/article30646836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25FIRMI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/firmino-nets-liverpool-a-late-winner-against-wolves-at-the-premier-league/article30646837.ece
441,2020/01/24,Sandhya hat-tricks in Sethu’s win in the Hero Indian Women’s League,"India international Dangmei Grace scored a brace to power KRYPSHA FC past Kickstart FC 4-0 on the opening day of the Hero Indian Women’s League football tournament, at Bangalore Football Stadium here on Friday.

Grace’s joy, however, was short lived as she was forced to leave the field after a collision with Kickstart FC goalkeeper Rashmi Kumari.

Rashmi suffered a cut near her chin, while Grace took a hit to the hip. Both players were taken to a nearby hospital.

They were discharged after being given stitches. Both are expected to be out of action for at least a week.

In another match, Sandhya’s hat-trick took Sethu FC to a 5-0 win over Kolhapur FC. Sandhya came to life in the second-half, where she calmly converted one-on-one battles with Kolhapur FC goalkeeper Shreya Hooda.

Amsavalli proved to be an able strike partner for Sandhya, creating chances regularly with sharp runs.

Amsavalli provided the opening goal, collecting a deflection off her own shot to slot it in.

The results: KRYPSHA FC 4 (Dangmei Grace 15, 36; Anju Tamang 19, Ratanbala Devi 64) bt Kickstart FC 0; Sethu FC 5 (Amsavalli 18, Sandhya 61, 66, 90+2, Sumithra 64) bt Kolhapur FC 0.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/gyru2/article30646649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25IWL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/sandhya-hat-tricks-in-sethus-win-in-the-hero-indian-womens-league/article30646650.ece
442,2020/01/24,Liverpool charge towards Premier League title with win at Wolves,"Runaway leaders Liverpool extended their Premier League advantage to 16 points with a hard-fought 2-1 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers on Thursday thanks to goals from Jordan Henderson and Roberto Firmino.

Henderson's opener in the eighth minute, which came off his shoulder from a Trent Alexander-Arnold corner, quietened a raucous crowd inside a mist-shrouded Molineux.

But Wolves, under coach Nuno Espirito Santo, have built a reputation for upsetting more illustrious opponents and came roaring back in the 51st when Raul Jimenez steered home a powerful header from the lively Adama Traore's cross.

Both sides squandered chances in a breathless game of counter-attacks, before Firmino found space in the box to settle the outcome with an 84th minute strike that gave Liverpool a 14th consecutive league win.

It was the Brazilian's sixth goal in his last eight games for the club in all competitions.

Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp punched the air and the fans sang “We shall not be moved” as the relentless Reds close in on their first top-flight title in three decades.

But Klopp, whose team missed out to Manchester City last season by one point, was taking nothing for granted.

“It's over when it's over, not before. So why should we really think about it? Let's carry on,” he said, praising “super, super” Firmino and “unbelievable” Henderson for their match-winning performances.

Laughing at his goal from a rare offensive foray on a set-piece, captain Henderson echoed his manager's words that the title was not in the bag - even though the whole of England thinks it is - and praised Wolves' impressive resistance.

“You know it's going to be difficult here. They're a good team, they make you work. But we knew we could keep going, keep fighting,” he said.

“Fantastic game”

The win put Liverpool on 67 points and they still have a game in hand over both defending champions Manchester City, who have 51 points, and Leicester City, who have 48.

Wolves are seventh, level on 34 points with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United who are all six points behind fourth-placed Chelsea in the Champions League qualifying spot.

Nuno, serenaded throughout by the adoring home fans, was delighted with his team even in defeat against a Liverpool side who had not conceded in their previous seven league games.

“It was a good performance, a fantastic game of football,” he said. “We played good, we had the momentum in the second half, we created a lot of chances.”

Liverpool's only sour note was a first-half injury to striker Sadio Mane. “It's probably a muscle, he felt something in the hamstring, we don't know yet,” Klopp said.

Even with Virgil van Dijk commanding Liverpool's defence as imperiously as ever, Wolves were undaunted and came at them time-and-again, often thanks to Traore's pace and strength.

Matt Doherty should have buried a header soon after Liverpool's first goal, and Jimenez blasted at Alisson in a one-on-one from a tight angle in the second period.

For Liverpool, Mo Salah buzzed with his usual menace, but could not find the net despite a string of chances. Alexander-Arnold's assist for Henderson's goal was his 22nd in the league since the start of last season, more than any other player.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/bjowuo/article30640297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKSOCCER-ENGLAND-WLV-LIVREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/liverpool-charge-towards-premier-league-title-with-win-at-wolves/article30640298.ece

“We clear them regularly but they would return, sometimes on the same day,” said a Corporation official.

The crowded road is used as a pathway by travellers on foot and two-wheelers to reach Chathram Bus Stand. The encroachments block the path.

“There are food stalls, jewellery stalls and other knick-knacks. They occupy the space along the path and passengers find it inconvenient. Several accidents have also occurred,” the official said.

As a lasting solution, grills are being erected on the pathway. “We have left enough space for two-wheelers to pass and we are erecting seven-foot tall grills to ensure that the encroachers cannot set shop,” he said.

445,2020/01/24,Cauvery river to get new facade,"Tiruchi Corporation’s plans to redevelop the Cauvery river front under the Smart City Mission has been approved by the high-powered committee.

The Corporation is planning to construct bathing ghats, retaining walls and other amenities along the river at an investment of about ₹3 crore.

“Three new bathing ghats will be built along Odathurai Road and tenders have been called,” a civic official said.

Further beautification works, including establishment of parks and walking tracks, will be planned soon, he added.

Meanwhile, students from the city-based CARE School of Architecture are working on recreating the 'glorious days' of the Cauvery river front by referring to archival photos and texts. They have studied the materials, identified and categorised bathing ghats along the northern and southern banks. A team is documenting the physical settings and life around the bathing ghats.

“It began as a simple college project but with the guidance of some of our professors and faculty members, we have learned so much and fallen in love with the city we grew up in. We have drawn up a tentative proposal for its conservation and rejuvenation in the form of design guidelines, drawings and recommendations, and will be handing it over to the con authorities soon,” a student said.

In October last, the Corporation began work on renovation of Oyamari bathing ghat at a cost of ₹35 lakh from the civic body's general fund. The bathing ghat was in a deplorable state with an old unstable structure. Parts of the structure, believed to be from the 16th Century, were demolished as it posed a threat to visitors.

455,2020/01/24,‘People misleading youngsters overMaoist ideology will not be spared’,"The government will not spare any person who tries to mislead the youth in the name of the Maoist ideology, Nehru Yuva Kendra Sangathan (NYKS) national vice-chairman S. Vishnu Vardhan Reddy has said.

More than 2.81 lakh tourists from Andhra Pradesh visited Kerala last year and the total footfall of domestic tourists to the State was around 1.56 crore. The programme was organised as part of the second phase of its domestic marketing campaign.

“Ten cities such as Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, Kolkata, Guwahati, Amritsar, Jaipur, Bengaluru, Chandigarh and Chennai have been identified for the second phase campaign. We are also organising meeting of tour operators from different cities with the hoteliers, resort and houseboat owners from Kerala,” said P. Muraleedharan, Deputy Director of the Department of Tourism of Kerala.

457,2020/01/24,Teak inspirations,"Teak has grains that make it look like a piece of art by itself, says Serin Elza John, a designer who works with the wood. Her designs try to bring out the inherent beauty of the wood, she says. While teak is usually associated with ornate furniture, Serin’s range of products include serve-ware such as trays, cake stands, coasters; home-decor pieces and even small accessories such as baggage tags in teak. “I feel the wood has a lot of potential that is yet to be tapped,” says Serin, who also works with rose wood and mahogany.

Her design sensibility veers towards creating something functional, rather than an unmoving piece that serves no purpose. The teak platters in her collection come with glass cloches, so they can double up as dessert platters too. “These are light and serve the purpose while still being a thing of beauty.”

Serin is an assistant professor of law, teaching at the Kerala Law Academy in Thiruvananthapuram. While she started designing furniture a decade ago, as a hobby, she launched her label t.e.a.k (The Eclectic Artisan Kraft) a year ago. Her family is into timber business and it helped with contacts in the industry. For over 40 years, they have dealt with different kinds of timber from Kerala forest teak to rosewood, mahogany, peltogyne (purple heart), and imported timber such as pyinkado. She used to run a business in furniture; but closed it down eventually as the industry had become predominantly driven my mass-manufactured furniture.

“Though I don’t possess a degree in designing, I have been working with a team of carpenters for years now. While I give them the designs, they give their inputs as well. It is a great exchange of ideas.” She also derives inspiration from her travels. Hand-crafted, the products often have surprise elements such as metal handles or with marble chips inlaid.

The carpenters, however, had to be re-educated on the potential of teak. “Many of them are experts in their craft, but they were only used to carving heavy pieces with teak. The fact that something minimalistic could be made was a new idea to them.” She works with a team of seven skilled workers. Rajesh and Suresh, the chief carpenters, along with the others — Vineeth, Vinod, Gopi, Reji — who help in polishing and finshing work. Serin’s team of artisans are from Thriuvananthapuram and she has been working with some of them for years. “I don’t outsource labour. The wood and the craftsmanship I rely on is from Kerala.”

She uses ethically-sourced teak (wood sold through Government auctions are ethically-sourced as opposed to that bought from private parties). Few designers venture into teak as the wood is expensive and working with it is time-consuming. “I, for instance, ensure that my artisans get the pay they deserve, which means my products tend to be a little more expensive.”

The process of making is labour and time intensive, says Serin. Wood tends to contract and expand based on the changes in weather. The wood has to be cut and left out to dry. Readying the wood alone could take about three months. The work then involves making the product, polishing and getting it printed, if the design so demands.

Serin’s products are available on Amazon and she retails through her instagram page as well.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/serin-elza-johns-line-of-products-in-designer-teak/article30644135.ece
458,2020/01/24,Four bikers from Visakhapatnam ride through three States to raise awareness about plastic,"It was a conversation with a scuba diver that changed Pranav Pulari’s approach to biking. He is the admin of Visakhpatnam’s chapter of a biking group called Road Thrills. “Scuba diver Subhash Chandra who has been clearing garbage from the sea bed at Rushikonda for four months told me how much damage discarded plastic was doing to marine life. I learnt how rivers and drains were dumping thousands of tonnes of plastic into the sea.” It was an eye opener and 22-year-old Pranav with his fellow bikers Rahul Jain, Kamal Dommeti and Rama Rao decided to do something about it. They chalked out a plan to visit major waterfalls in and around Andhra Pradesh and educate people about the hazards of having plastic in the water bodies.

The team visited eight popular waterfalls and beaches in Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Chhattisgarh and interacted with tourists and locals. The three-day expedition began from Araku Valley on January 20 and concluded in Bheemli.

The planning took four months. They plotted a roadmap with all the popular tourist destinations along the way and carefully planned the other logistics.

Their bikes, helmet and riding gear earned them curious attention from passers by at every pitstop. They were asked questions and that gave them an opportunity to share their mission. “We had initially planned to cover 2500 kilometres in three days, but later we reduced that distance to 1800 kilometers only so that we could spend more time interacting with the people about the cause,” says 27-year-old Rahul.

The bikers held forth about hazards of littering and explained how much damage was being caused to marine life thanks to mindless and callous attitudes. Pranav shared what he had learnt from the scuba diver. “He told me how fish often got entangled inside bags and how some others could not lay eggs because the sea bed was covered in plastic. We encouraged the tourists we met to dispose their plastic responsibly,” adds Pranav. They also interacted with the vendors around these tourist places and urged them to switch to sustainable cutlery and packaging.

“Of all the places that we visited, Gandahati Waterfalls in Souther Odisha was easily the filthiest. It was littered with takeaway containers, wrappers and plastic bags. The edges of the pool in front of the waterfall were awash with plastic bottles and containers,” says Rahul.

The team cleared some of the garbage near the waterfalls and tried in vain to fit them into dustbins. “Unfortunately, the whole area had just two dustbins, which were already overflowing. We had to collect the trash in a bag and keep it next to the bins. When we questioned the authority in charge of the upkeep of the area, their response was that they were understaffed and therefore could do little about it. The bikers put up banners about responsible waste disposal, printed in Odiya and English in the gardens near the waterfalls.

The Gopalpur beach was a study in contrast. It was pristine thanks to the combined effort of people and the administration. “The beach was one of the cleanest spots on our rides. The one-and-half kilometre stretch had dustbins stationed at regular intervals. The food vendors do not use plastic . It is all paper bags and cups,” says Rahul.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/o3si6p/article30642080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23VZBIKERS-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/four-bikers-from-visakhapatnam-ride-through-three-states-to-raise-awareness-about-plastic/article30642081.ece
459,2020/01/24,China virus 'too early' for emergency declaration: WHO,"The viral illness in China that has sickened hundreds of people and prompted Chinese authorities to effectively shut down three cities is not yet a global health emergency, the World Health Organisation said Thursday.

The U.N. health agency issued its evaluation after Chinese authorities moved to lock down three cities indefinitely earlier in the day and canceled major public celebrations and gatherings in Beijing during the Lunar New Year holiday period to try to contain the evolving outbreak.

Also Read WHO’s unexplained hesitancy

During a news conference in Geneva, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that while the epidemic was clearly a crisis in China, “it has not yet become a global health emergency. It may yet become one.”

T he steps taken by China to shut down cities with more than 18 million people are unprecedented in public health, as countries typically shy away from such extreme measures. Tedros said that while WHO’s role is to provide science-based recommendations, “at the end of the day, a sovereign country has the autonomy to do what it thinks is right.”

The decision n ot to declare a global emergency “should not be taken as a sign that WHO does not think the situation is serious or that we’re not taking it seriously. Nothing could be further from the truth,” Tedros said. “WHO is following this outbreak every minute of every day.”

The United Nations health agency made the decision after independent experts spent two days assessing information about the spread of the newly identified coronavirus.

""It’s too early to consider this as a public health emergency of international concern,” Didier Houssin, the chair of the emergency advisory committee, said, noting that the panel “was very divided, almost 50-50.”

WHO defines a global emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. Previous global emergencies have been declared for the emergence of Zika virus in the Americas, the swine flu pandemic, and polio.

A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous foreign governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. Deciding whether an outbreak amounts to an international crisis therefore can also be politically fraught.

In 2014, WHO resisted declaring the devastating Ebola epidemic in West Africa to be a global emergency because it feared the announcement would anger Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

During a news conference in Geneva, Houssin suggested that China’s view of the outbreak was a factor in Thursday’s decision.

""The perception of this declaration by the international community, in the most affected country, by the people struggling with the virus, certainly has to be considered,” he said.

Other cases have been reported in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Thailand. Singapore, Vietnam and Hong Kong reported their first cases Thursday.

While airports in many major cities around the world have instituted health screenings for arriving passengers from China, Tedros said that “for the moment, WHO does not recommend any broader restrictions on travel or trade.”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/dsmg02/article30631132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKAPTOPIXCHINAOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/china-virus-too-early-for-emergency-declaration-who/article30638285.ece
